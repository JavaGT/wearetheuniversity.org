accurate.</p><p>um<br>what i want to focus on is generally how<br>we assess the cost of climate change<br>and why um i think that the<br>the current assessments of the cost of<br>climate change are underestimating<br>the costs and belinda will focus on a<br>specific case study for<br>new zealand and one specific channel<br>through which<br>climate change will have an impact<br>now if we think of and and my i'm an<br>economist and i apologize for that<br>um but um that that is going to be my<br>focus<br>the economics uh the economic costs of<br>climate change so there are<br>other costs which i'm not going to be<br>speaking about much<br>um there are two basic ways in which<br>economists try to assess the costs of<br>climate change<br>one is through statistical estimates<br>based on<br>on the past so looking at<br>the past in terms of temperatures and in<br>terms of economic activity and assessing<br>from that what would be the cost when<br>the temperature<br>changes that's a bit like looking at the<br>rear view mirror<br>to know where you're heading which is a<br>fine strategy if you are thinking about<br>the next bend in the road uh maybe<br>um but if you are thinking about a rope<br>road that is 500 kilometers away it's<br>probably not the best way to understand<br>what would be the road conditions<br>right and in in that sense i think that<br>that<br>method of assessing the cost of climate<br>change which is quite popular and there<br>are a lot of papers that have done that<br>is not very good if we are thinking<br>about um what will happen<br>20 years or 30 years or 40 years from<br>from now it might be<br>pretty good to understand what will<br>happen next year<br>because of climate change so that's<br>that's one approach<br>the other and maybe the more more<br>popular and more<br>prevalent approach is using integrated<br>assessment models<br>so the integrated assessment models as<br>the name<br>imply they integrate to two kinds of<br>models they integrate a model of the<br>economy<br>and a model of the climate okay so the<br>model of the climate the climate<br>scientists do that<br>which you know i'm not a climate<br>scientist so i don't know how they do<br>that but they have a lot of models of<br>the<br>climate they acknowledge that all of<br>them are<br>wrong but they average them out hoping<br>that the average somehow makes<br>makes sense um that's the the modeling<br>of the climate and then we have models<br>of the economy<br>which are probably even worse um than<br>the models of the climate because here<br>we are talking about modeling people<br>rather than modeling<br>atoms and and<br>people change uh and<br>and their behavior changes but anyway we<br>have models of the climate model of the<br>climate a model of the economy and then<br>we have these two arrows<br>which basically integrate the two right<br>so we know that the economy affects the<br>climate and we know that the climate<br>affects the economy<br>and that's what we're trying um to<br>assess but we need to make a lot of<br>assumptions about the ways in which the<br>economy affects the climate and the way<br>in which the climate affects the um the<br>car<br>the economy so if we look about<br>the results from these integrated<br>assessment models<br>this is this looks at sort of probably<br>this<br>the um what is it the seven most uh<br>popular<br>um integrated assessment models that are<br>used uh globally to assess the cost of<br>climate change<br>and here you have just a description of<br>how much damage they think<br>will will climate change cause to the<br>global economy as<br>um as a function of how<br>how what the temperature change will be<br>now if you're at all familiar with the<br>discussions about climate change<br>you know that for example in the paris<br>agreement in 2015 the<br>the discussion was mostly whether we<br>should<br>um aim for a two percent increase over<br>uh pre-industrial times uh two percent<br>two degrees not two percent two degrees<br>uh above the industry um um<br>pre-industrial period or or maybe 1.5<br>and that was<br>you know the main discussion everybody<br>agreed that<br>that above that would be um too risky<br>but if you look at the<br>integrated assessment models if you look<br>at what they predict will be<br>will be the cost for a two two degrees<br>increase in temperatures most of them<br>think that it's not very large<br>okay and yet they do think that climate<br>change will have a big impact<br>if we get to you know the five six<br>degrees above<br>pre-industrial times but most<br>non-economists think that<br>five six degrees above pre-industrial<br>tribes will be catastrophic<br>right so so the question is where is the<br>mismatch coming from<br>from those two uh models i'm going to<br>first go back a bit and give you one<br>example of where i think<br>the integrated assessment models are<br>wrong<br>and this looks at extreme weather events<br>okay<br>the integrated assessment models all try<br>to<br>understand the impact of the average<br>change in the climate<br>but i think all of you know that one one<br>way in which the<br>uh climate change is is having an impact<br>on us is through the impact of extreme<br>the changing the probability of extreme<br>weather events<br>so climate change is causing extreme<br>weather events<br>now it's not strictly causing them<br>because extreme weather events happened<br>before climate change we've always had<br>floods and hurricanes and tropical<br>cyclones and<br>and jout but it's changing the<br>probability in the same way that's<br>smoking causes cancer<br>lung cancer right you can get lung<br>cancer if you don't smoke<br>and you can't smoke all your life and<br>never get lung cancer<br>but we know that that smoking changes<br>the probability of lung cancer<br>of getting lung cancer in the same way<br>climate change is<br>changing the probability of being<br>flooded of experiencing a drought<br>and so on and in the last um 10 years<br>we've had a lot of advance in the<br>science you know assessing<br>what is the change in that um<br>probability<br>of these extreme weather events i'm<br>going to focus on one example<br>briefly and that's hurricane harvey that<br>occurred in 2017<br>in houston in texas and<br>you know a very stable genius observed<br>that<br>it was one of the wettest ever seen<br>that hurricane was one of the wettest<br>ever seen from the standpoint of water<br>which not sure what he means but he<br>meant but luckily he has no twitter<br>account anymore so we don't know<br>um in any case<br>that is that is you know this was<br>acutely observed that was<br>what was unique about hurricane harvey<br>was the fact that it had<br>it dumped a lot of water on houston and<br>resulted in<br>in extensive flooding in the city of<br>houston<br>so what we do in a paper that we<br>published last year<br>we look at what is the change in<br>the probability of hurric what was the<br>change in the probability of hurricane<br>harvey occurring<br>because of climate change the the change<br>of causality here is pretty<br>simple um it's simple enough that i can<br>understand it<br>the water temperature in the gulf was<br>higher than usual because of climate<br>change because the water in<br>the gulf of mexico was um higher that<br>meant that the<br>hurricane had more moisture in it and<br>because of that it dumped more water on<br>um on houston right<br>and the destruction that resulted from<br>that hurricane was not from the wind was<br>from the water<br>was from the flooding so what we know we<br>know that<br>and there are some you know some range<br>of estimates<br>but roughly speaking about um the event<br>became more likely by<br>between you know 70 to 80 percent uh<br>because of<br>um because of climate change okay<br>so the the fraction of attributable risk<br>of hurricane harvey was pretty high<br>okay without climate change it's very<br>likely that hurricane harvey would have<br>dumped a lot less water<br>on houston now we can<br>combine that with the cost that we know<br>that hurricane harvey had on the city of<br>houston<br>uh which was again there are different<br>estimates but around<br>roughly a hundred billion dollars um<br>and that's a big billion right<br>um so 100 billion dollars and then we we<br>basically multiply the two and we can we<br>can conclude<br>that the anthropogenic impact of<br>hurricane harvey was 67 billion<br>dollars so what do we mean by<br>anthropogenic that is<br>caused by us because of climate change<br>okay so without<br>um us and climate change the cost of<br>hurricane harvey would have been<br>a lot um less because it would have been<br>weaker<br>now if you think of back to the those<br>integrated assessment models<br>we are now roughly one one degree above<br>pre-industrial times so what are they<br>predicting<br>in terms of um of the current cost of<br>climate change<br>well nothing pretty much<br>right but i just argued that hurricane<br>harvey had 67 billion dollars of damages<br>so what we do is we take one of those<br>models actually the most prominent<br>one which is dice dice is a<br>model that was developed by william<br>northhouse<br>and he largely won the nobel prize for<br>in economics for that for that model<br>and what if you look at the dice model<br>and what the dice model<br>says well<br>you need to do some crunching of numbers<br>but basically the dice implies that in<br>2017<br>the total cost of climate change in the<br>united states<br>in 2017 was 18 billion dollars<br>18.8 billion dollars okay that's the<br>total cost of climate change<br>um in in uh in the us and that includes<br>everything it includes the three<br>hurricanes that occurred in the us<br>in 2017 because they were other than<br>harvey there was also irma and<br>maria it also includes the fires in<br>california it includes<br>all these other droughts and all these<br>other impacts of climate change that<br>happened<br>in um 2017. now you don't need to be a<br>mathematician to know that 67 is bigger<br>than 18.8<br>okay so just hurricane harvey in houston<br>is much the cost of the anthropogenic<br>cost of hurricane harvey<br>is much bigger than what the iam is<br>predicting for the whole of the united<br>states for the whole of that year<br>okay athletes want to suspect that maybe<br>the iam<br>the integrated assessment model at least<br>this one is wrong<br>okay now why might they be wrong there<br>are<br>um potentially many answers<br>um and probably all of them are true to<br>some extent<br>first of all the models as all models<br>are<br>um are useless um this is you know i'm<br>sort of misquoting a<br>quote about planning right people say<br>that planning is useless but<br>yeah plans are useless but planning is<br>everything in the same sense that's true<br>for modeling as well<br>models are useless uh but the modeling<br>is is<br>is important because that allows us to<br>focus on what kind of channels<br>of causality might matter okay<br>um so models are as<br>modeling is essential but but this what<br>these models spit out might<br>uh conceivably not be very reliable<br>there are cascading costs that we ignore<br>in those models<br>um and you can easily think of cascading<br>costs and the most<br>sort of obvious explanation is the<br>most obvious example would be the<br>drought in the middle east<br>that led to the arab spring that led to<br>the flows of<br>immigrants from the um<br>from the middle east to europe and then<br>to brexit so you can pretty<br>pretty easily tie a fairly convincing<br>causal chain<br>from climate change to brexit that<br>an example of a cascading cost are a lot<br>of non-monetized costs<br>i'm aware that i need to finish right um<br>and and there are other issues like all<br>these models<br>um assume linearities in the cost so<br>um for example about extinctions<br>we assume that the losing one pair of<br>of moas is the same as losing the last<br>pair of more of breathing moas<br>and that's clearly not true in many in<br>many instances<br>so we do think that for example<br>extinctions are worse<br>there's issues around discount rates<br>which is incredibly boring<br>discounts rates typically economies<br>assume a discount rate of five percent<br>arguing that that's about the real rate<br>of interest but the real rate of<br>interest hasn't been five percent for at<br>least a decade<br>um but even if you use a two percent<br>discount rate<br>uh in the iams um<br>you end up with with with scenarios in<br>which the<br>future more than 30 or 40 years from now<br>doesn't matter<br>matter that much and that's you know<br>whether we should<br>take that ethical position is um is<br>questionable<br>but that's very important um<br>some people argue like nick stern lord<br>nick stern<br>that you should use a very very small<br>discount right maybe zero<br>zero point one percent um and that<br>changes the cost of climate change<br>tremendously the the the conventional<br>integrated assessment models user<br>typically use a discount rate of about<br>two percent<br>um but you know that changes for example<br>the<br>um just to give you an example the trump<br>administration when it<br>came to power changed the the discount<br>rate used<br>in the official integrated assessment<br>models<br>that the u.s uses to calculate the<br>social cost of carbon<br>and they they changed it to five percent<br>which meant that the cost of carbon that<br>they estimated<br>um went down from about 35<br>um a ton to two dollars a ton<br>um and then they realized then they<br>argued then therefore we shouldn't do<br>any mitigation because the cost of<br>um there was another difference that<br>they have made but i'm not gonna<br>focus on that um what should be the<br>the um social cost of carbon<br>is something we derive from these iams<br>and that<br>that's a very important number because<br>that that determines what should be the<br>uh price of carbon that we do we use in<br>those<br>emission trading schemes that we use<br>globally so for example anybody knows<br>the<br>yeah so it's about you know if we look<br>at in u.s dollars because most of the<br>international literature is the newest<br>dollars it's about 30 um<br>us dollars most of the integrated<br>most of the people have looked at that<br>think that the cost should be at least<br>twice as big<br>some people argue it should be 10 times<br>as big<br>but clearly 30 30 us dollar per ton is<br>is less than the social cost of<br>carbon even in in the<br>there's other issues around for<br>population ethics but i'm not gonna<br>i'm gonna cut that and i'll be happy to<br>address those in<br>so i'm belinda's story um i have my own<br>research organization and i'm a somewhat<br>delinquent phd student as well<br>so here at book<br>um the way that i came to thinking about<br>pricing<br>risk in climates was wanting to see<br>how property prices were changing and i<br>started<br>looking at the coast more and more as i<br>would visit my mum and dad's beach house<br>and thinking about what was likely to<br>happen to property prices<br>and what i realized is that property<br>values were likely to<br>that were they were effectively changing<br>from permanent ownership rights<br>to temporary use rights that there was a<br>time limit being set on climate<br>on coastal property now once i started<br>looking at this i realized that it<br>wasn't just coastal property it's any<br>location that has escalating hazards<br>so sometimes when you start looking at<br>something um i developed a framework<br>with looked at<br>what the possible areas of of influence<br>on how long you could stay would be<br>there<br>initially i thought it was about how<br>long the land was there so i looked at<br>information about coastal engineering<br>and what sea level rise was going to be<br>the end of the century<br>but when i started modeling this i soon<br>realized that there were a number of<br>other retreats that were going to occur<br>that would impact the value of the<br>property well before then<br>but sometimes when you start wanting to<br>answer a big question you then find that<br>there's a significant piece that's<br>missing so you get together a team<br>to look at that and try and answer that<br>piece so what i realized<br>is that insurance was going to have a<br>significant impact on property values<br>and i needed to be able to bring<br>together a team to look at<br>insurance retreat so i<br>started to have an id looking at<br>thresholds that were applying<br>internationally<br>um and we heard from the insurance<br>industry that they were very<br>unlikely to continue to insure a<br>property for flooding once the<br>probability got<br>um to one and 25 years so what that<br>means is that one in 25 years means<br>you've got<br>about a four percent probability of the<br>event occurring<br>each year now we talk about<br>annual exceeded probability so we<br>convert that return period<br>so a 1 in 25 or 100 to the<br>annual probability so an event that<br>might happen<br>one in a hundred years has a one percent<br>probability of happening<br>each year and that's a really key point<br>to think about when you're thinking<br>about<br>climate change is that those events<br>are becoming more frequent and just<br>because you had a 1 in 100 years<br>storm happened last year doesn't mean<br>it's going to be 100 years before the<br>next one happens<br>so with a 100 year event it has about a<br>1<br>aep and you'll exceed its probability<br>um you can use that that is a baseline<br>that a number of insurers use<br>um in terms of mapping out floodplains<br>for example<br>and what we heard from the insurance<br>industry is that once an event gets to<br>about a four percent probability so<br>about a 125-year event<br>they would not continue to offer<br>insurance<br>now you'll nev you won't see that in any<br>annual report of any insurer anywhere in<br>the world<br>but we have been able to validate that<br>by looking at where insurance has<br>remained available<br>where there's bigger shift to be very to<br>be even more conservative we took a<br>higher percentage so we took a five<br>percent<br>aep so that about a one and twenty year<br>event<br>and we use that as our threshold but<br>what we know is that in some locations<br>even when you get to only two percent<br>probability every year you can<br>start to have restrictions placed on<br>your insurance availability<br>interestingly when we did the literature<br>review we found that in the uk<br>the probability that threshold that<br>private insurers were using was only 1.3<br>so private insurers stopped offering<br>insurance<br>in the uk once the probability got to a<br>175-year event<br>so people who are in a one 100 year<br>flood plane<br>with just a small increase in that<br>probability from one percent<br>to 1.3 or finding that they weren't able<br>i'm going to talk here a little bit<br>about um how that change in probability<br>works<br>with climate change now i'm using a<br>normal standard distribution here<br>many hazards use this some of them don't<br>um but it is the one that's most<br>familiar to people so i use this to kind<br>of explain the concepts<br>so when we talk about climate change<br>there's some parts of climate change<br>that are easier to predict<br>in terms of the science um scientists<br>have the most confidence about<br>temperature change they have<br>reasonable confidence about sea level<br>rise if we ignore the ice sheets<br>um they've got a bit um we've got less<br>confidence but they're<br>right at the edge of the science in<br>terms of precipitation and no one in the<br>world is able to model how<br>storm surges are changing in terms of<br>climate change that's something that is<br>at the<br>beyond the reach of science at the<br>moment but obviously intense<br>efforts um looking at that<br>so what you have here is<br>there we go so this bit down here<br>um is an example of an insurable event<br>so an insurer isn't going to ensure an<br>event that happens all the time<br>they're going to ensure the rare events<br>and so under climate change<br>the entire distribution is shifting<br>how much it's shifting by is something<br>that climate scientists are looking at<br>and we have one of them at least one of<br>them in the room here today at the back<br>with luke<br>i'm wanting to get an understanding of<br>how these distributions are shifting<br>but what we find is that when the<br>distribution shifts<br>you would have heard ilan talk about<br>that all of the<br>most of the modeling to date has been<br>done on the averages of climate change<br>so it says<br>how is this new and where is this new<br>average going to be<br>now the new average happened fairly<br>frequently in the old distribution<br>so in this example it happened about<br>once every six years<br>so the new average will feel quite<br>familiar but what happens is<br>at the extremes you get these really big<br>shifts<br>in the probabilities of events<br>now insurers are going to want to keep<br>their threshold<br>as that distribution shifts they will<br>shift with it<br>and so people who might previously had<br>got insurance<br>because they were within this<br>probability are unlikely to find that<br>they're<br>still getting um insurance once it<br>shifts this far<br>and you might say well how big of a<br>shift is that is that something that's<br>going to happen<br>at the end of the century what we found<br>is that um<br>with just a really small amount of sea<br>level rise<br>you can get five times increase in the<br>probability of an extreme event<br>so if you're in a one percent<br>probability you can go to a<br>five percent probability in wellington<br>with 10 centimeters of sea level rise so<br>just a really small amount of sea level<br>rise<br>is enough to shift that now climate<br>change is also changing the shape<br>of these distributions as well and so<br>so we have received funding from the<br>national science<br>challenge the deep south natural science<br>challenge and<br>we got together a team and we worked<br>with them on<br>wanting to understand what those<br>thresholds would be<br>now we looked just at sea level rise we<br>didn't look at extra storminess<br>so just sea level rise so we used<br>um analysis um that was undertaken<br>using um extreme event analysis and what<br>that does uh generalizes three values<br>sorry and what that does<br>is calculates how the probabilities<br>change<br>one with just a small amount of sea<br>level rise so what you see here these<br>are all<br>um intersecting at the one percent aep<br>so what it's saying is how much sea<br>level rise<br>does it take to start moving up this<br>here<br>and what you'll see is these different<br>shaped curves in auckland and wellington<br>ended even in christchurch and one of<br>the key insights that we got from this<br>is that<br>because we have such low variability<br>in our storm surges in new zealand we<br>have hugged our coasts very tightly<br>and it means that it only takes a very<br>small amount of sea level rise<br>for us to start over topping our<br>barriers the difference between<br>auckland and wellington is all to do<br>almost all to do with tidal range<br>so i'll talk you through a little bit<br>there<br>so bear with me here just want to help<br>you get through<br>it took me a while so if you've got a<br>big title range<br>so you've got a title range of about<br>four meters<br>and your um i've split this into<br>uh basically the tides into quarters<br>so if you get a storm surge come in at<br>low tide<br>doesn't matter it'll get absorbed within<br>the existing<br>tidal range if a storm surge comes in<br>at high tide or even three-quarter tide<br>then there's a real chance it'll over<br>top<br>but if you've got a small tidal range<br>like wellington<br>then again if you get a storm suit<br>happen at low tide it's okay<br>but if you get a storm surge happen even<br>at mid tide<br>it'll over top so what that means is<br>here you've only got a 25 chance<br>of a storm surge of that size over<br>topping<br>but here you've got a 50 chance<br>of it over topping so what that means is<br>with exactly the same amount of sea<br>level<br>rise across all of the new zealand<br>coastline<br>wellington will experience a greater<br>shift in the probability of over topping<br>um sooner before than auckland will<br>they're not far behind but they are<br>there<br>so what we looked at is what would the<br>insurance premiums be<br>in the absence of retreat and we define<br>insurance retreat as the<br>um situation where a person who has<br>who has previously had insurance or a<br>property who has previously had<br>insurance finds that they're<br>declined or they know no longer receive<br>a renewal<br>what we found is that when we talk with<br>people most people assume that if they<br>don't engage in insurance fraud and they<br>continue to pay the insurance premiums<br>on time<br>then they will have an ongoing<br>relationship with the insurance provider<br>and they will have insurance at least<br>for the length of time that they own<br>their asset<br>but insurance premiums are provided<br>every renewed every year<br>every year the insurer decides whether<br>to renew that<br>and whether to continue with you and if<br>the probability is shifting and is<br>reaching that threshold<br>they will simply not offer they won't<br>tell you why<br>because there's no incentive for them to<br>tell you why they'll simply decline it<br>partial retreat happens when there is a<br>reduction<br>in the range of policy that is available<br>to you<br>so we know that in flockton basin for<br>example when the earthquake happened and<br>flocton basin effectively<br>formed a bowl that collected a whole<br>bunch of rainwater<br>what you had there was you had um 10 000<br>excesses applied to flood insurance that<br>is transferring quite a lot of the risk<br>back to the insurer<br>that was one way that the insurer<br>manages the cost of insurance<br>by by putting in these very high<br>excesses<br>interestingly what we found is that<br>there were locations in these<br>floodplains<br>that should be paying much higher<br>premiums today<br>than they are and we anticipate that<br>that's probably because there's<br>cross-subsidization<br>so there's cross-subsidization between<br>risky locations and less risky locations<br>to be able to have a more even<br>difference between the policies but if<br>you increase your probability of an<br>event from a one percent to a five<br>percent<br>your insurance premiums you should<br>expect them to go up by five times<br>so we then mapped those against those<br>thresholds and what we found is that it<br>takes just a very small amount<br>of sea level rise in wellington for<br>people to start to experience that<br>partial retreat<br>and by the time you've got to 12<br>centimeters you're very unlikely to<br>if you're currently in a 1 um adp zone<br>we then met that against timing about<br>when we would have given the amount of<br>sea level rise we can expect in the next<br>20 years<br>next 30 years there's not much<br>difference between the representative<br>concentration pathways<br>because sea level rises tint is baked in<br>it's quite a long lag period so there's<br>a lot of difference there<br>so what we found is that wellington and<br>christchurch are the<br>ones that are first likely to experience<br>uh retreat<br>but even in auckland and dunedin which<br>have larger total ranges they will also<br>should be experiencing full retreat um<br>now again this is just with sea level<br>rise this isn't any increase in<br>storminess so this isn't any<br>stronger extra tropical cyclones for<br>example that<br>alain was talking about um when i talk<br>about this people often say<br>well okay a private insurers are pulling<br>out what can we do<br>one thing they say is can we hard enough<br>coasts and i won't talk about that today<br>but the other thing they say is well can<br>you see stephen<br>and i would strongly encourage you to<br>think twice about<br>having eqc step in the um in the states<br>there are a number of international<br>examples of this but the<br>most famous one is the national flood<br>insurance program<br>it came about following hurricane betsy<br>in 1965<br>where there was a significant damage<br>people weren't insured private insurers<br>that we weren't going to do it and so<br>that there was a publix<br>scheme set up what that does it was<br>designed to be grandparented but instead<br>of actually grandparenting those people<br>in those current locations<br>what it did was subsidize a massive wave<br>of coastal development in the 70s<br>onwards<br>and to give you a very concrete example<br>ilan and i are very much<br>motivated we undertake this analysis<br>because we want to be able to identify<br>ways to reduce<br>the full risk not just transfer it to<br>someone else<br>on the basis that we are reducing the<br>risk to life<br>so it might not seem like it when we're<br>looking at numbers all the time but we<br>we undertake that work because we're<br>wanting to reduce the<br>those individuals that are kept in<br>harm's way and to give you an<br>example the location that had some of<br>the biggest damage in hurricane betsy in<br>1965<br>was louisiana was um new orleans and it<br>was the knight<br>ward which some of you were probably<br>familiar with from news reports so<br>hurricane katrina's<br>large fatalities that happened in the<br>night forward where the<br>levees failed so subsidizing insurance<br>keeps people in harm of a hundred<br>locations<br>uh this is a brief summary of some of<br>the papers that<br>alan and i have published recently<br>but we are very keen to hear your<br>questions<br>for a mic because um we're recording<br>recording it<br>and without the mic but that's all i<br>know<br>will that be online yes yes everything<br>i had a question about the insurance<br>first of all thank you that was really<br>interesting um<br>to what extent do you know are insurers<br>um commissioning their own<br>modeling versus relying on publicly<br>available modeling data<br>um depends uh you best to ask tim<br>grafton that for the insurance council<br>um but what we observe is that<br>reinsurers<br>hire climate scientists um but local<br>insurers will tend to<br>retail insurers so the people that you<br>tend to buy will tend to rely on public<br>under research not not internally<br>so the insurers operating in new zealand<br>typically<br>by modeling risk modeling from several<br>providers like rms and um<br>i think there are there's a bunch of<br>others that have stepped in<br>recently but rms was used to be the only<br>one here in<br>new zealand so it used to be the case<br>that all the insurers were<br>buying the same model<br>which is which is worrying in and of<br>itself but then<br>questions oh we've got matt coming<br>through<br>kiara thank you for your presentation<br>i'm interested<br>in your engagement with the climate<br>change commission<br>you know and any thoughts that you had<br>on their<br>take on the impacts of climate change on<br>economy<br>um so um we um uh<br>whenever research is completed we<br>undertake active briefings<br>to share that research but um and so all<br>of our research would be available to<br>them and we do have conversations with<br>them and<br>we collaborate with at least two of the<br>council um<br>commissioners on research themselves um<br>but<br>in terms of making an assessment i<br>you know that's not something i'd do<br>today<br>and most of the climate change<br>commission work up to now i speak mostly<br>about mitigation rather than<br>impact so mitigation meaning<br>you know what would be the kind of paths<br>to reduce<br>greenhouse gas emissions and so on and<br>thank you for your presentation i'd like<br>in climate change issue would there be<br>any property owner<br>they are located in a coastal area being<br>rejected for their<br>insurance application and also in<br>developing<br>normally the coastal area gives the view<br>and the lifestyle<br>would climate change issue inhibit<br>developed developer<br>to develop in coastal areas and go to<br>inland<br>um so on the first question um we<br>believe that people are definitely being<br>declined insurance<br>on the coast but we don't know where we<br>can we can undertake analysis that<br>estimates where it is<br>because the insurers do not provide that<br>information the other piece is i know<br>that some real estate<br>agents say check if you've got insurance<br>but all that is you're checking have you<br>got insurance today<br>have you got insurance for the next year<br>and then in terms of<br>developers um the what we see<br>from international research is that<br>the changing risk is not currently<br>incorporated in decisions<br>so the things that you talk about about<br>the view and the like<br>people value that so much that they tend<br>to ignore the risk<br>and yeah<br>thank you you had a question<br>thank you very much why do insurers<br>retreat<br>rather than stay but adjust their<br>premiums<br>what's the mechanism that makes retreat<br>the right commercial strategy<br>um we anticipate that that's mostly<br>because of reputational risk and if i<br>give you a concrete example when the<br>each cam flood banks failed<br>there was a pensioner<br>who found that his insurance premium<br>went up to five thousand<br>dollars a year and as a pensioner he<br>called radio new zealand and he says i'm<br>a pensioner that's a hundred dollars a<br>week i can't afford insurance policy<br>after that the insurance company said<br>i'm sorry that was a mistake<br>will change your insurance premium but<br>that will probably only be temporary so<br>what they find is that people have a<br>sense of outrage<br>when if your insurance premiums are<br>increased by five times<br>even if it's justified even if it's<br>justified on a break-even analysis<br>people have a stronger reaction to it<br>and from an insurer's perspective you're<br>better to simply quietly decline<br>that wouldn't be the case in commercial<br>maybe adding one more<br>aspect here while the change is gradual<br>the insurance is changing their risk<br>models only<br>periodically maybe every 10 years so<br>that means that<br>they they can't slowly ramp up their<br>premiums but rather when they adjust<br>their<br>model they realize okay we need to<br>increase the premium by 50<br>and then you get this outrage and<br>reputational risk that they don't want<br>to incur<br>and it's easier for them to say okay<br>well so we just come from<br>yeah i've just got a question sorry i'm<br>not an economist can you explain to me<br>the term discount rates<br>yes um so discount rate is basically<br>what<br>what how do you how does how do you view<br>the future versus the present<br>okay and and the standard assumption in<br>economics is that<br>for every future year we value it a<br>little bit less<br>okay that's what we call the pure<br>discount<br>the pure discount rate um on top of that<br>there's there's<br>other aspects of that because of<br>uncertainty and so on but um<br>but basically the the idea is that uh<br>in our assessment of the future we<br>place less importance of the future than<br>the present and there's plenty of<br>research that shows that people actually<br>um<br>do that okay but the extent of the<br>discount of the future is is<br>we don't know where the mics are yes<br>thank you i'm interested in your<br>comments about<br>the cost of climate change when we're<br>talking about<br>non-tangible assets such as<br>in the pacific when we're talking about<br>identity loss of homes and<br>economies are not very good at thinking<br>about that<br>um or measuring that for that matter um<br>and that to some extent so so this<br>refers both to my<br>comment about non-tangible assets or<br>non-quantifiable assets and also<br>non-linearities<br>uh because we we think differently about<br>for example an<br>island where people need to move a<br>little bit inland<br>versus an island like tuvalu or<br>which will actually disappear with sea<br>level rise<br>and then there will be a culture that<br>will disappear because of that<br>um when when everybody will have to go<br>to a diaspora of some sort<br>um so all of these things are very<br>difficult to<br>quantify okay that doesn't mean that<br>they're not important<br>right a lot of the things that are most<br>important in life are<br>unquantifiable a lot of the things we<br>quantify are not<br>terribly important but um but you know<br>that<br>that's that's the constraint we work<br>with<br>in our um the whatever program is a<br>major program looking<br>at extreme events and within that we<br>have a<br>stream of work that is specifically<br>looking at<br>uh led by sean r terry which is looking<br>at the the definition<br>of damage from a tower maori perspective<br>to<br>try and broaden that because we tend to<br>think about deaths and dollars when we<br>think about disasters<br>but broadening that about what is the<br>a wider definition of damage that is<br>thank you for your presentations i just<br>wanted to circle back to the question<br>that was asked at the front there and i<br>apologize if this is a double up i<br>couldn't quite hear the whole question<br>but i'm interested not only in the<br>developers perspective or what their<br>thoughts are which we hear is not many<br>about what's going on around that space<br>apologies to any developers in the room<br>but what about the territorial<br>authorities and their responsibilities<br>in the space as well<br>if they know there's likely to be harm<br>either directly through<br>risk to life but secondly secondarily<br>well-being um because of impacts of<br>financial<br>catastrophe that result from this so<br>when does the law start to actually come<br>in from a<br>ta perspective to help manage that so<br>for my um<br>when i started looking at this i<br>interviewed people about<br>the national policy statement<br>which came in in 2010 and what i heard<br>uniformly<br>is that it is ignored that it is almost<br>impossible<br>for a local government to hold that now<br>one of the principles says that you<br>should take into account<br>climate change hazards over the next 100<br>years but any time that a local<br>government tries to do that they end up<br>in court<br>and so um we strongly encourage<br>that that councils are<br>be required to provide information on<br>risk<br>and that their the relative role they<br>have<br>compared to developers who can be well<br>resourced in terms of legal approach<br>is rebalanced so we know that there is<br>development continuing and people who<br>who are um uh doing their darndest<br>to slow down development find that they<br>are very<br>immediately find themselves in court um<br>i think it's helpful maybe to talk about<br>the cup of tea case here because that's<br>the most<br>center chilling chilean effect through<br>um local government<br>um and so alan did a piece of research<br>to say well what actually happened here<br>and it turns out<br>so the the history of the catholic cause<br>if you're not familiar<br>the captives council put some uh warning<br>in on their limbs<br>of houses there that um you know some<br>houses will become<br>uninhabitable in the future and they had<br>several scenarios 50 years<br>managed 50 years unmanaged and so on um<br>and and they put this on the list saying<br>for these specific houses<br>um this house this land is not going to<br>exist in 100 years or in 50 years<br>and they were taken to court and<br>had to remove those warnings from the<br>list um<br>so we we also looked so that that's<br>that's the chilling effect for accounts<br>local councils who then say<br>okay we you know kept the council which<br>is not a very wealthy big council<br>had to spend a lot of money defending<br>its position in court and then lost<br>um and had to remove those uh warnings<br>um<br>so that that's one aspect of it we also<br>looked at the prices of property<br>as a result of that putting it on the<br>limb and then removing it from the limb<br>surprisingly there wasn't much impact so<br>prices<br>went down by maybe two to three percent<br>because of the warning on the limbs for<br>those properties where warning was<br>placed<br>um and then when it went back up<br>once the the warning was removed from<br>from the limb<br>um so you know<br>it's it's a the local authorities are in<br>a very difficult position<br>um the government is aware of that and<br>um and<br>and we are talking about the review of<br>the resource management<br>management right so hopefully any future<br>act that will emerge from that we will<br>john maynard keynes would probably<br>embrace a disaster like an earthquake<br>similarly because of all the rebuilding<br>effort afterwards<br>so in terms of what you're doing here<br>how<br>do you define cost i see you put on a<br>slide where you<br>say uh nord house and damage but damage<br>is not necessarily cost<br>how do you define costs simply because<br>one<br>person's cost is another man's or<br>person's benefit<br>yeah um this is a very long answer<br>um to that um<br>what is the um so first of all<br>your comment about john miner okay<br>that's that's what we call the broken<br>windows fallacy<br>right um the broken windows policy is we<br>can increase gdp<br>by breaking a window because then we<br>we need to hire you know somebody to um<br>to fix the window<br>so that that's been known um<br>the economist who came up with the<br>broken windows fallacy was frederick<br>bastiat in the 19th century<br>this is not a new idea that you can't<br>measure just gdp<br>and say everything is fine because we<br>had some we've<br>broken some windows so<br>we're not under any illusion that this<br>is this is the right<br>answer so what um they're looking at<br>where is my um which one<br>yes thank you um so when you have a<br>disaster<br>you have damage um so when you have a<br>disaster<br>you have damages so that's assets that<br>that get destroyed<br>and that can be mortality or morbidity<br>um and it can be displacement or asset<br>damages damage<br>assets that get destroyed and then that<br>leads to indirect losses which means<br>decline in economic activity<br>because of the assets that were damaged<br>there might be a stimulus effect because<br>then you're spending money<br>on um on<br>on rebuilding those asset base um<br>and then eventually or or in the long<br>term you might have lost<br>well-being because of the assets that<br>were damaged yes you spend money on the<br>reconstruction but that money could have<br>been spent elsewhere<br>so it could have been you know putting<br>in parts instead of building the<br>road that was destroyed right or and<br>therefore<br>there is a loss to well-being in the<br>long term because of that<br>um of that damage that's the short<br>answer to your um<br>to your question but it is a complicated<br>issue right there's no<br>one easy number that we can always use<br>without<br>attaching a lot of caveats and nuances<br>about what that number<br>means the number that i quote for<br>hurricane harvey is the damage<br>okay the number that the uh integrated<br>assessment models<br>talk about is the the indirect losses<br>to to gdp okay so it's a flow variable<br>versus the<br>um asset the stock variable that<br>for harvey okay<br>yeah just following on from the second<br>to last question<br>from what you know the insurance<br>companies<br>how much notice do they take on about<br>local policies applying to coast for<br>example<br>local authorities that might plan to<br>build sea walls rather than<br>retreat i mean related to that um how<br>open have the insurance companies been<br>with you in discussing these issues i<br>get the impression that they don't<br>they're not being terribly transparent<br>towards the<br>client their customers but have you been<br>able to have direct discussions with the<br>companies<br>yes we do have direct discussions but we<br>um so we have a collaborative you know<br>we we test ideas and we absolutely brief<br>them before<br>before my research came out but um they<br>they don't provide data there are some<br>jurisdictions that do require<br>company insurance companies to provide<br>insurance<br>retreat information to the regulator and<br>we would strongly encourage that we<br>don't<br>doesn't necessarily have to come to<br>researchers but the regulator the people<br>who are making policy decisions should<br>um tcfd will do will encourage<br>insurers to provide some reporting but<br>they won't<br>um there is a there is a possibility<br>that it will escalate<br>insurance retreat because they<br>they will need to have more transparency<br>about cross-subsidization<br>but yes that is something that we are<br>looking at in terms of<br>um how the impact of tcfd will have um<br>on insurance and insurance<br>um on the economy did i answer your full<br>question well the first part about<br>what else do they take note or do they<br>take account of money<br>so insurance companies um will<br>absolutely<br>want to see about whether there's<br>defenses put in place<br>an insurance company has every incentive<br>to encourage a local government<br>to spend public money on defenses that<br>allows them to remain in place<br>for the next year the cost of that<br>defense might<br>have to be spread over 50 years but<br>there's always an incentive for the<br>insurance company to encourage that<br>defense to be put in place<br>because they maintain their market at<br>the back<br>i wonder if you have any insights into<br>how insurance companies approach<br>cross-subsidization of premiums say<br>so it is puzzling that you observe cross<br>subsidization because in principle why<br>would the private insurer<br>embark on any cross-subsidization i<br>think there's two<br>um two issues here one is the<br>reputational issues that we<br>already discussed so they perceive you<br>know<br>they're worried that it will be<br>charge radically different amounts from<br>people who have the same value<br>property so they're worried about that<br>therefore they even though their model<br>may be suggested the difference should<br>be this side they<br>decrease the difference because of the<br>reputational concern<br>the other issue is that their modeling<br>is not very sophisticated<br>um so they don't they don't really have<br>very good<br>quantification of the risk because not<br>because you know they're<br>ignorant or anything it's just it's<br>expensive to um<br>to do sophisticated modeling and they<br>maybe rightly<br>are decide that it's not worthwhile<br>um to really spend a lot of resources<br>on on very particular modeling for<br>specific properties<br>um because the cost doesn't doesn't<br>match the kind of benefit that they can<br>get by differentiating the um<br>now because the cost is changing and<br>and declining the cost of modeling is<br>declining that<br>implies that we will move more and more<br>towards this discrimination that this<br>it's not discrimination is not maybe the<br>right word because there's a negative<br>connotation to that<br>but but differentiation in terms of of<br>insurance premiums<br>and we're seeing that hi<br>um i've got uh two quick questions<br>hopefully quick um the first one is a<br>practical one<br>as i understand it for the the<br>changing and uninsurability you're<br>basically drawing a line on a map which<br>is the one percent<br>aep there there's a thing there and then<br>basically people live between that one<br>percent line<br>and the ocean um that's because that's<br>the max we've got<br>we would very much like to have more<br>granularity then<br>do you have any rough idea as to the<br>extent to which<br>the distribution of assets between that<br>one percent line<br>and the ocean differs city to city<br>and then the second question is um<br>this sort of parameter in what they<br>mentioned<br>stuff like the houses like<br>it must go from one percent to two<br>percent risk to three percent risk<br>and then you're in the ocean um<br>you know all along that gradient does<br>there much difference<br>um city city well it's overwhelmed by<br>the amenity value so it's overwhelmed by<br>sea views there's no<br>there's very little discount in property<br>values at the moment because of<br>climate change the studies that have<br>been done suggest that even in the<br>centre of miami<br>or near the coast of miami that there's<br>a discount of four percent<br>which is not likely to be around sorry i<br>was talking about the<br>annual excellence probabilities but yeah<br>yep yep that's what i mean<br>we don't know the um we don't have<br>mapping like that so we don't really<br>know how the you know<br>within the differences across cities of<br>the gradient from the one percent<br>um up upward towards the ocean we don't<br>know if the gradient is different across<br>so<br>as a newest endeavor will have uh that's<br>led by sandeen<br>um will include better information on<br>that in terms of flood lanes<br>i've got one quick second question is<br>that this this all kind of makes sense<br>when you're talking about okay<br>um you've got a four percent chance for<br>a given year that an event happens<br>and for the purpose of flooding it kind<br>of makes sense that conceptually<br>maybe that's the inundation of your<br>house a place<br>what is the equivalent that we can talk<br>so we rely on damage functions um so<br>particular types of<br>events will have different impacts so<br>in this for example when we were looking<br>at flooding if you're less than a<br>certain height of flooding<br>and you've got a wooden floor you'll<br>probably get 30 of the value of your<br>house will be damaged<br>so that's a damaged function that tells<br>you whereas in the case of a fire if you<br>get a house fire in your house you<br>pretty much got a 100<br>damage so we have information on that<br>that is<br>looking at past events<br>and you have similarly you can have<br>damage functions for wind damage and for<br>for other types of hazards so in<br>principle<br>you can do the same kind of analysis for<br>other types of<br>of hazards if you think that your damage<br>functions<br>are good enough<br>so i'm wondering how big events have to<br>be for you to reasonably take the kind<br>of approach that you took with<br>with harvey to look at the fractional<br>risk um you know could we look for<br>example<br>at the hurricane that hit by a plenty in<br>2017 and look at something like that<br>or is that just too small<br>um so in principle you can calculate the<br>fraction of attributable risk to any<br>kind of extreme event<br>in some cases even for for big<br>hurricanes the fraction of attributable<br>risk might be very small<br>or might be very large in heartbeat it<br>was very large which is why we chose<br>that<br>event but you know equally it could be<br>very<br>um very small in principle you can<br>calculate that but that<br>look might be a better place to to<br>respond to that<br>but in principle you can you can<br>calculate the<br>change in the probability or any type of<br>event<br>the problem is it's it's um complicated<br>to do so typically it's undertaken for<br>fairly big events so it started being<br>done<br>with the heat waves about 15 years ago<br>in in euros<br>especially the one i think in 2003 was a<br>very very large<br>heat wave that caused a lot of mentality<br>so so this paper here<br>includes information on um attribution<br>events in new zealand<br>and so one of our colleagues um has led<br>work that looked at<br>for example flooding in northland and<br>the flooding that<br>flooded out south dunedin and what they<br>found that the flooding in south africa<br>had only a five percent<br>attribution whereas the flooding in<br>northland had much more so<br>they can be done i<br>think we need to finish the<br>to stay here and answer any other<br>questions if anyone have<br>any thank you very much for uh for<br>coming<br>and i hope to see you again in some<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
