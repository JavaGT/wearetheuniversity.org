well<br>so that's me<br>brilliant thanks<br>yeah hi thanks for the<br>intro um kevin marty uh good to see you<br>guys here i'm stuck in a garage here in<br>auckland at the moment<br>um<br>so yeah i'm currently<br>a performance physiologist for high<br>performance sport um<br>working up in<br>auckland and um my main role for the<br>olympics was to<br>sort of develop and implement heat<br>management strategies across<br>a lot of teams and athletes uh in the<br>system<br>and yeah as as bret is where i've done a<br>little bit of work with the sevens<br>um<br>guys<br>across the last few years as part of my<br>phd when i was um<br>over there the adam scene of high<br>performance from i've been i was there<br>since 2018 to<br>uh end of 2020<br>um yeah that's a brief intro me<br>my name is connor mcneil i am the head<br>strength and conditioning coach for all<br>black sevens uh my role during the tokyo<br>olympic games is just to kind of<br>coordinate a bit of the heat response<br>stuff from steven and as well as work um<br>with brett around some of our kind of<br>load management and then just make sure<br>our players are in peak kind of physical<br>condition<br>um during the olympic games so making<br>sure they're at their best when they<br>need to perform at their best<br>and i'm also a phd student with the<br>university of waikato based here in the<br>mount mount manganui<br>where i study a bit of strength and<br>power research that i've been able to<br>apply and use with some of our athletes<br>brilliant thanks connor uh last but<br>um<br>as i was done just introduced himself my<br>name is brady anderson i'm the street<br>finishing coach for our blackburn sevens<br>women's side<br>i try to do everything that connor does<br>just on a<br>lesser level property<br>i've been with the team for five years<br>now and<br>been lucky enough to to work alongside<br>brett stephen and connor last week and<br>learned a lot from these lads so looking<br>forward to today's chat<br>very brilliant<br>thanks guys so yeah it'd be great if you<br>could just uh give us a little bit of a<br>chat about your journey and the pathway<br>that brought you to be uh where you are<br>now and and how you got to be at the<br>olympics and and you have that fantastic<br>experience so just yeah tell us a little<br>bit about your your journey connor<br>yeah so if you can tell from my accent<br>i'm from the us originally um grew up in<br>the seattle area and i've kind of taken<br>a different path than maybe a lot of<br>other people just because of my<br>international kind of background so<br>um i've been with the sevens<br>organization for about a total of two<br>years now i've started as the<br>development snc for the all black sevens<br>before coming on as a strength and<br>conditioning coach<br>across both programs so assisting brad<br>and assisting<br>the men's program as well before<br>stepping into the head strength and<br>conditioning role<br>kind of<br>immediate lead up to the games<br>but as a strength and conditioning coach<br>this profession has kind of brought me<br>all around the world so like i said<br>started out in the u.s<br>where i lived in five different states<br>working with a range of athletes from<br>young development<br>um all the way up to<br>professional and some of the u.s olympic<br>committee athletes as well<br>and so just got a taste for such<br>the kind of wide world that sport is and<br>that led me to different places so<br>worked in nice france briefly as well as<br>tianjin china before having a cup of<br>coffee with the head trainer for the all<br>blacks when they were crushing team usa<br>and an international test match<br>um so that cup of coffee led me down to<br>new zealand where i started a phd in<br>2018 around the same time as steven did<br>and some of my research played directly<br>into some of the work that i now do<br>with the all black seven so<br>um kind of a winding path for me but<br>it's always been a dream to go to the<br>olympics and tokyo was amazing in that<br>respect so<br>um<br>again kind of a different journey maybe<br>but it's been quite a ride that was a<br>thrill of a lifetime being able to go it<br>must have been a good cup of coffee yeah<br>yeah<br>what was your educational pathway so<br>what did you study at university<br>yeah so um with the way that the kind of<br>higher education system works in the u.s<br>spent two years my first two years of<br>uni<br>um doing general studies so i kind of<br>had some interest in sport it kind of<br>had some interest in business<br>before i got into a<br>random sports psychology class actually<br>that kind of sparked my interest and<br>once i had a taste of that i knew that<br>this was going to be my pathway it's<br>just kind of this passion i<br>i had always played sports so i played<br>american football at the university<br>level and was a hammer and shot put<br>thrower for the athletics team as well<br>so i kind of been um immersed in that<br>process like as an athlete and then<br>through some of my studies was able to<br>kind of turn that passion into more of a<br>skill set um<br>and then pursue that so my undergraduate<br>work led to a master's in health and<br>human performance and then that led to<br>the phd here in new zealand<br>cool thanks for that connor<br>uh brad would you like to carry on<br>yeah um<br>my junior suppose started way back this<br>is i don't even know connor and stephen<br>were probably still at primary school<br>when i was at university um<br>and uh i was in year two of a of a<br>three-year degree which probably ended<br>up being a five-year degree but john<br>cronin a mentor of ours come into our<br>class and said there was an opportunity<br>as uh as an intern with the blues rugby<br>franchise at the time and um i was a<br>league growing up so it wasn't you know<br>wasn't really following rugby at the<br>time but uh an opportunity to come up<br>interviewed<br>got the internship spent 12 months with<br>the blues and then was lucky enough to<br>follow that internship into auckland<br>rugby where i spent another 12 months<br>working alongside blair mills<br>and then that sort of led to an<br>opportunity with norfolk rugby where i<br>was the academy snc<br>and long story short a mentor took left<br>there so he put me in the hot seat as<br>head as the c for northern rugby so i<br>spent four years in total um sitting<br>with the tonight<br>and then moved down to auckland rugby<br>where<br>you know played multiple hats over the<br>course of about six years where there<br>was<br>women sevens women's fifteens uh<br>international academy kids from japan<br>argentina<br>europe the states would come across<br>would essentially smash them really not<br>really make them better at rugby just<br>give them a hide and send them back<br>and uh that led to a hitting snc rule<br>with open rugby<br>for two seasons i think and then the<br>opportunity with the woman seven sort of<br>come up<br>and<br>probably not feeling confident in my own<br>abilities to actually execute the role i<br>still put my name in the hat and<br>was lucky enough to be given the role<br>and sit down with bunts and get to work<br>alongside him and corey and and stu and<br>then obviously you know you meet the the<br>likes of stephen brent and connor and<br>you you realize how little you actually<br>know<br>so it's been a it's been an unreal ride<br>um probably the course the last 13 years<br>and growing up i'm i'm unsure<br>now when i look back at my childhood<br>upbringing and<br>not that it was rough or anything but<br>just you know all the opportunities that<br>i've been given over there over the last<br>five years i never would have dreamt as<br>a kid that i would have traveled around<br>the globe the way we have to follow a<br>game of<br>seventh rugby essentially<br>that's been awesome<br>that's why it's so interesting to hear<br>people's stories and journeys because<br>yeah there isn't really a one<br>right path to take us there and<br>sometimes it's just about taking that<br>leap and<br>having a bit of faith and the people<br>around you you know<br>the mentors and the people that help you<br>out along the way<br>100<br>obviously when i was at uni<br>back in those days everyone had a<br>certificate a diploma and only the top<br>level students had a degree<br>and so i chased the degree but now<br>obviously<br>a degree is just your entry level into<br>what you see now with connor and stephen<br>doing your masters and then going on the<br>phd and any students watching you know i<br>can't recommend that enough<br>everyone<br>obviously industry experience is huge<br>but<br>being an expert in an area is definitely<br>going to put you ahead of other<br>candidates that are you know that are<br>that are going for roles similar to<br>yourself so<br>just unmute myself<br>um yeah so<br>i guess a similar line is um<br>like you were saying it<br>had a different pathway i guess like<br>you're saying there's no real<br>one way to<br>you know<br>um to to be in the industry so i'm from<br>i went to my university in dunedin i i<br>did it a bachelor's of applied science<br>and support and exercise nutrition<br>um and when i started that my goal was i<br>wanted to be a<br>sports dietitian<br>was that that was kind of why i started<br>university and i was really passionate<br>about that kind of<br>side of things and sort of metabolism<br>and things and so i did that and then i<br>got to the end of it and i started doing<br>dietetics and<br>i didn't like it because it was really<br>clinical<br>um<br>and i could just see myself ending up in<br>a hospital<br>um working feeding people through tubes<br>and stuff so i um<br>i decided to switch over to the the pe<br>school down there and um<br>i had some really good mentors there of<br>uh nancy reahar and<br>jim cotter and exercise physiology and<br>metabolism<br>and i did my masters through that<br>program<br>it was in um<br>energy like energetics of sedentary<br>behavior so it had still kind of<br>limited<br>functionality in terms of sport but it<br>was<br>it was around energetics but<br>doing that you kind of learn along the<br>way what what you're like and what<br>you're passionate about and<br>i was playing quite a lot of rugby at<br>the time and<br>you know really into sport so i always<br>knew i was into rugby into sport and<br>into<br>the science around in the background of<br>it so anyway i finished my masters there<br>and<br>had a couple years off um<br>being a tour guide actually cruising<br>around the south island um<br>doing tramping trips with american<br>terrorists and during that time i just<br>keep my eye out for<br>things to pop up and um<br>it was lucky enough that the stars<br>aligned for me for<br>a scholarship at the<br>university of waikato adams center to<br>work with the sevens program<br>um<br>uh it was so universe waikato high<br>performance sport and<br>new zealand rugby um and so when i saw<br>that i was like well this is exactly<br>what i want to do and<br>so i did that and it was just to develop<br>and sort of help them out with a bit of<br>heat declaration<br>and cooling strategy stuff for the<br>olympic campaign<br>uh so i applied for that and i was<br>fortunate enough to get it and um<br>spent a couple years there and there was<br>awesome like getting to know brad and<br>connor and um the whole the whole group<br>of coaches and staff and it was like<br>i suppose it was my first real um<br>deep dive into<br>professional sport um<br>when i turned up so it was pretty raw<br>but i learnt a heap just by being in the<br>environment like fred says<br>just being around uh<br>people and getting to know the systems<br>and things and you could learn a lot<br>just by being<br>sort of immersed<br>in a professional environment<br>um<br>so yeah i did that and um<br>then<br>through my relationship with high<br>performance sport uh<br>the<br>the person that was doing my role at the<br>moment went on maternity leave so um<br>again i guess the stars aligned a little<br>bit for me to<br>get into this tokyo role so<br>and in tokyo i was um<br>we had a prep and recovery team so i was<br>they sent a physiologist a strength and<br>conditioning coach and a nutritionist so<br>i was the physiologist as part of that<br>group and um<br>was sort of in charge of the recovery<br>area so it led well to the skills i'd<br>learned across the<br>time with sevens with recovery and um<br>calling management and things like that<br>so<br>yeah that was sort of<br>how i got there i suppose um<br>it's been a great journey and i'll be<br>really grateful for the time with<br>the sevens group across in the mount<br>there and<br>and there and what i learnt through that<br>process<br>all right thanks steven and we'll um<br>we'll move on to uh brett so see uh<br>been on the walker there and across the<br>jump the ditch but uh yeah can you get<br>to tell us a little bit about your uh<br>journey brett and how you came to be at<br>the tokyo olympics<br>yeah<br>um again it's good to hear everyone's<br>different journeys<br>my journey was pretty different uh<br>school didn't go too well<br>and so i was heading into the army<br>and i went up to burnham<br>and one of the officers there took a bit<br>of interest and said why don't you tie<br>officer training and duntroon you've<br>done reasonably well at school<br>which is sort of the first time anyone<br>had talked about anything like that so i<br>had to do a year of university to get<br>into officer training<br>so i went into university with the goal<br>of um officer training<br>actually in duntroon which is just down<br>the road from where i am at the moment<br>here in canberra<br>and uh never left university basically<br>um<br>i<br>was was interested in sport um i still<br>can't<br>i didn't apply for physical education um<br>but for some reason<br>i ended up there and i'm still not sure<br>how to be honest i've got a letter a<br>random letter from someone in the<br>physique school offering me a place here<br>i've done reasonably well in sports i<br>guess that's<br>how it happened because i never applied<br>and so i did physical degree and<br>um yeah<br>and then went on and did a masters and i<br>did my masters with rowing and uh the<br>head coach from new zealand heard about<br>it<br>and so he invited me um i actually moved<br>to university of canterbury and was<br>working there invited me to waikato<br>university<br>i started working with<br>new zealand rowing in<br>for the atlanta olympics preparing for<br>atlanta olympics uh heat preparation<br>there was a great man who's<br>unfortunately dead now gordon's leave it<br>was great uh mentor<br>ellen hahn who was the head of the<br>australian institute of sport mentored<br>me a little bit through that period of<br>time as well<br>and that sort of started the journey um<br>so i<br>was an academic who worked<br>with new zealand rowing for quite a<br>while<br>again managed to be really fortunate<br>that a guy called dick tonks<br>took over the program in 2000 and him<br>and i just had a pretty amazing<br>relationship he's the ultimate artist<br>and i try to use<br>scientific principles uh i had a very<br>good masters and phd supervisor of will<br>hopkins so he sort of really<br>made me think about the world as an<br>experiment for one of better terms so<br>tonks the artist and<br>either scientist and there was just the<br>most amazing journey i think when we<br>started we were 35th in the world and<br>you know when i finished we were in the<br>top three for the last six years so<br>you know i was going<br>to world championships and and getting<br>absolutely last to<br>to the last period of times we're going<br>to olympic games and and doing really<br>well um<br>i<br>had to make a decision to go<br>full time with new zealand rowing or<br>back to academia or waikato university<br>uh waikato university pitched me a good<br>good option so i dropped out of sport<br>went to waikato university<br>um the chiefs basically knocked on the<br>door and said hey we're hear you're not<br>with rowing anymore you're interested in<br>rugby<br>so i got involved with rugby um and<br>some most amazing coaches dave rainey<br>wayne smith tom coventry and andrew<br>strawbridge and i've<br>continued friendship with them all the<br>way through um so i<br>i mean wayne smith walks all around the<br>world so wherever he goes i go with him<br>uh so we've worked in the usa uh<br>europe uh japan<br>um<br>yeah so i switched from rowing to uh<br>rugby<br>um some of the coaches that i've worked<br>with in rowing have asked me to come<br>back and do little roles of them so i<br>was with the swiss team uh for the rio<br>olympics as well as being with the<br>chiefs<br>with the blues at the moment um<br>blair mills and brad uh made contact<br>with me about working with the sevens so<br>i<br>was a seven so it's been a it's a long<br>journey i'm probably a bit older than<br>everyone else um<br>it's again stephen made this uh<br>statement about the stars aligning well<br>i i never planned this this is all all<br>accidental you know even even the<br>leaving rowing and getting to rugby i<br>mean it was basically cold call tom<br>coventry rang me and phil healey rang me<br>and it went here and wayne smith got<br>hold and in touch with me and<br>yeah and in the sevens as well too i<br>mean that was pretty much cold calling<br>so<br>um<br>i'd like to tell young people that you<br>should plan and<br>do things because these things open up<br>but like i said you know<br>i was told in school it uh i'd never go<br>to university because it wasn't clever<br>enough and all that sort of stuff<br>so the army or driving a truck was my<br>options and now i've got a phd<br>masters<br>undergrad with double major<br>other qualifications as well too being<br>to multiple olympics multiple world<br>championships um<br>yeah<br>you know you've got to pick the people<br>you listen to i think that would be my<br>message<br>cool thanks brett<br>oh that was really interesting to hear<br>everybody's different stories it's a<br>yeah amazing how people can get to<br>similar places but you know wildly<br>different different paths so um so now<br>we'd just like to move on about your<br>actual tokyo you know tokyo experience<br>um so if you could just describe to us<br>um you know obviously going to the<br>olympics is really just a<br>select few that um you know managed to<br>experience you know the the olympics um<br>so we'd just be really keen to hear<br>about your experience and what your you<br>know your most memorable moment<br>um of the tokyo olympics was for you um<br>so brad we might just start with with<br>you for this one<br>yeah can i just quickly touch on like<br>all our speakers so connor stephen and<br>brett have all said the start of the<br>line to get them into these positions<br>but but for any any of them listening<br>like connor stephen and brett are<br>extremely good at what they do<br>and that is and that is that is front of<br>mind for me and at the same time they're<br>all good humans so<br>it's all it's all good you students<br>being at uni and and getting your phds<br>and mastering all that but if you're a<br>dick<br>you're probably not going to get to<br>where these this crew is sitting so just<br>have that in the back your mind know<br>learn as much as you can um but then<br>also to learn to learn how to talk to<br>other humans but that's a that's a big<br>part of why these guys sit in their<br>chairs um<br>and they and they turn and they turn up<br>like two in the morning<br>emails from connor like 5 a.m in the<br>morning stephen probably about lunchtime<br>when he wakes up but<br>everyone else like these guys are hard<br>workers and and you know for anyone<br>watching that that's that's gonna<br>underpin anything you do and that<br>that'll<br>employers will look at that irrespective<br>of of how high your qualifications are<br>so<br>get the calls<br>talk about some of those attributes<br>don't they that require zero talent and<br>and that's the you know 100 100<br>i just just wanted to put that out there<br>to anyone that's that's listening right<br>these are smart dudes but they front up<br>and and for us i suppose and rugby<br>that goes a long way so but i i think um<br>the olympics<br>sam's kind of like<br>i learned pretty quick that i was<br>a poor athlete like had tried and tried<br>and tried to be an athlete but that<br>wasn't gonna that wasn't gonna happen so<br>i wanted to go to the olympics bad<br>and when this role came up it was it was<br>sort of a no-brainer that i could<br>potentially go to the olympics in a<br>supporting staff capacity which which i<br>was passionate about<br>but the the olympic games itself on uh<br>on a professional level you think it's<br>the pinnacle of all sport but for me it<br>was<br>it was a stress-free<br>week once we landed in the village i had<br>dreamt of being quite stressful and<br>just the pinnacle horse board and get<br>wound up and all that but because of the<br>boys on this course so stephen running<br>the calling area like he took things<br>away from my role that could then just<br>allow me to oversee<br>other areas and put all the pieces of<br>the puzzle together so brett handled my<br>loan stephen handled my recovery i lent<br>on connor for the gym<br>and it was my job just to just to keep<br>things moving in the in the right<br>direction and because i had that their<br>support from these lads on the call<br>the time there was it could allow me<br>just to enjoy the<br>olympics as a spectacle and almost you<br>know nail my role but but also just be a<br>fan<br>if that makes sense so when i when i got<br>to the village<br>the village was everything you could<br>dream it a as a as a as a again as a<br>spectacle you got the world's best<br>athletes all in one place so<br>you had these massive 150 kg weight<br>lifters you know you had these two foot<br>tall gymnasts<br>you had seven foot basketballers<br>volleyballers rowers and it was just it<br>was just amazing to see um<br>you know<br>when they're all in one place how i<br>suppose not how inadequate you feel as a<br>human but<br>i was definitely felt like i was walking<br>around land of the jones<br>but it was just it was just an awesome<br>experience and because of<br>all the support i had i could just enjoy<br>the week so for me the olympics was<br>was a great experience and can<br>probably allow me to be<br>to revisit my thinking and hopefully<br>and go to the france olympics in 2024<br>so<br>thanks brad um<br>steve<br>and um<br>yeah<br>the reason why it took me to lunchtime<br>to email you is because i was drinking<br>that plunger coffee<br>and you guys you know as a student like<br>you<br>it's just what you got to do whereas you<br>know you guys are out at your cafes<br>drinking your long macchiatos and stuff<br>um there's probably another key to<br>success i think you'd say is having at<br>least four or five coffees before midday<br>that's brad's word anyway<br>um<br>so<br>my<br>my tokyo experience so i was in i was<br>literally in the basement basically the<br>whole time i<br>as part of the um<br>it was a skeleton crew of the new<br>zealand olympic team so we turned up<br>it was like 10 days before the olympics<br>started and we set up but there was<br>actually real interesting just to turn<br>up to the village when no one's there<br>and you see the it's really raw like the<br>it's basically not finished and<br>um<br>you know and you just set it up and make<br>it look really good and put all your so<br>we set up a gym we set up a recovery<br>pools area<br>we set up a little kitchen nutrition<br>spot and<br>i really enjoyed that experience because<br>it's like those intangible things that<br>you don't really get a university<br>to learn but you just<br>you know need to know how to do plumbing<br>um<br>build<br>and you know do electrical work and<br>stuff which i don't know how to do<br>really but it was quite fun trying to<br>figure it out we only blew up<br>one<br>uh transformer and nearly had a massive<br>fire and burnt the whole building down<br>but that was all good um so that was<br>quite funny actually turning up and<br>doing all that stuff we prepared really<br>well for it we we knew what we were<br>getting into we brought a lot of stuff<br>over we bought two shipping containers<br>worth a kit<br>um<br>so we had heaps of stuff and heaps of um<br>kind of contingency plans about things<br>if things weren't going to work and<br>um yeah so that was interesting and then<br>during once athletes started to turn out<br>i i really enjoyed the process of<br>following through<br>um<br>the athletes<br>through their through their like<br>pre-training week and then through their<br>competition weeks like just i guess<br>emotionally like it i don't think i<br>prepared myself for<br>that side of thing like always being<br>performance orientated<br>and in all the detail you don't really i<br>guess<br>that was the the<br>the biggest thing i think i didn't<br>that kind of side of things it and it<br>was like it's really raw you know like<br>down in a<br>in the pre-from recovery area like<br>people coming for a cold pool or<br>whatever before they're for pre-calling<br>and post calling and<br>that's kind of when it's really real for<br>them seeing like the rowers an hour and<br>a half before their gold medal row or<br>and then or straight after a row where<br>they haven't done<br>as they expected and um<br>and<br>yeah i think that was real really<br>of of the<br>of the olympics um<br>probably be<br>the thing that would stick with me the<br>most along with<br>it's interesting being on calls with um<br>the new zealand olympic team and<br>comparing the experience to the<br>paralympic team it sounded like the the<br>new zealand team<br>at the olympics had a really good<br>culture compared<br>to the para team and and like everyone<br>was connected and we had a good kind of<br>um<br>team culture within teams and and i<br>think that was really special<br>in the way that we could celebrate<br>people's success um<br>at the village even though it was<br>heavily restricted we were still able to<br>kind of haka for people and uh<br>and and do those little things that were<br>really special<br>so yeah i think that'll be those will be<br>the things that i'll remember the most<br>is that kind of<br>uh stuff alongside the actual<br>competition<br>it's interesting to hear you sort of<br>talk about that and that sort of for<br>nangatanga that sort of talk about those<br>relationships and those um connections<br>and i know that was a big part of the<br>the culture and the sevens set up as<br>well obviously but just you talking<br>about how the athletes are real people<br>you know they experience emotions and<br>that you know they're not just these<br>robots that you see on tv<br>so yeah forming those connections is<br>obviously a massive part of what you<br>guys do as well<br>yeah super interesting uh thanks steve<br>yeah yeah mine was obviously uh<br>different i've been part of the new<br>zealand olympic program for many years<br>um<br>and been involved with new zealand teams<br>uh what was different<br>um the resourcing is massive in<br>australia<br>and the expertise that you can you can<br>uh go to is is huge as well although in<br>saying that um i spent a lot of time<br>with jim cotter um down at tiger<br>university he had helped me for<br>uh athens and beijing and<br>and other other events so i went back to<br>him but but that would be my biggest<br>thing um difference i mean we had to<br>have a plan together in 2016<br>uh for<br>the tokyo olympics and it had to be<br>you know well considered because it got<br>slammed by a lot of experts and you know<br>uh the difference for me was is that<br>when i was talking about the<br>environmental plan i i was talking to<br>people who had who had planned for<br>atlanta in athens and beijing and<br>heavily resourced and things like that<br>so we had to have multiple plans in<br>place and<br>it took a lot of time to get those plans<br>and in 2017 we dry ran our plan<br>uh 2018 we adapted our plan so<br>as we headed to um to tokyo you know we<br>had an a and a b plan and then covert<br>obviously meant that we needed to have a<br>c plan as well but it was easy to<br>generate the c plan because we had such<br>a well developed a b play and we just<br>took elements of that and i spoke to jim<br>again i caught it down at tug university<br>about that and and at the same time i<br>was involved in the sevens program as<br>well too<br>and through my connections with museum<br>rowing um and and there's great people i<br>mean<br>uh in new zealand i got to know the two<br>sports scientists um<br>uh justin and caroline before and during<br>the olympics and i mean they're good<br>people but that would be the biggest<br>difference is the resourcing the thing i<br>found quite fascinating being here<br>there's a lot of research work that's<br>been done that isn't published so i had<br>access to that and you know when you<br>like us yeah<br>that would be my uh my biggest<br>difference<br>i wanted to go to tokyo because it was<br>different i wanted to compare it to the<br>other olympics that i've been to and i<br>knew that<br>you know i might not go to too many more<br>olympics<br>for various reasons but i wanted to go<br>to this one because<br>just to look at the difference and boy<br>was it different it was massively<br>different and<br>because i've worked in japan for five<br>years i understood the japanese because<br>i've been to olympics world champs i<br>understood ioc and fisa international<br>and and we we had a lot of problems so<br>you know pretty much every day we were<br>problem solving around<br>uh various things because<br>we lost two days of competition in the<br>rowing um we weren't at a normal<br>recovery i basically prepared the<br>athletes competition and recovered them<br>post-competition that that was my job at<br>the olympics and every day something<br>happened whether the italians next door<br>to us got covered so that happened and<br>in the dutch and in the bay next to us<br>they got covered so that caused problems<br>and then<br>just it was just the most amazing<br>experience and<br>um<br>every day was a challenge every single<br>day was a challenge and we had to be<br>agile we had to be clever<br>but one of the things that i would<br>would add is<br>because we prepared so well so<br>really well we were forced to buy the<br>australian system and because we were so<br>heavily resourced the athletes<br>had<br>real confidence what we're doing and<br>we'd practiced everything so everything<br>we did nothing was new to the athletes<br>and i think that was my biggest<br>difference between australia and zealand<br>we talk about new zealand being great<br>with number eight why are you that's<br>really really cool but you know for some<br>of these people we took the olympics<br>that was their one or only chance<br>they'll be the only one olympics so you<br>for you listening you know be prepared<br>be prepared be prepared even if the<br>organization is not prepared<br>think about your plan a b and c and if<br>you can start trialing those and getting<br>getting the athletes on board with those<br>types of things<br>my other difference perhaps between new<br>zealand australia um<br>and their coaching team you know we have<br>guys with phds in physiology uh master's<br>degrees in physics or you know postgrads<br>in physics<br>so<br>typically in these in in australia<br>because there's so much money in sport<br>you can have a career as a coach you're<br>not i can go to the olympics with 60<br>year old coaches 50 year old coaches<br>have done six olympic games<br>so often<br>they won't devolve responsibility to you<br>you've got to persuade them about what<br>best practices so you change the way you<br>operate you don't operate in a vacuum<br>off to the side<br>you you have to be able to educate and<br>explain to the coaches so those are<br>probably my unique experiences<br>cool thanks brett uh yeah it sounds like<br>uh having a plan a plan b plan c is uh<br>yeah really important to not just at the<br>organization level but you know also uh<br>on on the ground level so uh yeah cool<br>uh connor what was your tokyo experience<br>like<br>yeah i guess just off the back of what<br>brett was saying um and it's kind of<br>understated but the the level of<br>preparation planning that goes into<br>something like that i mean you're<br>talking about ten thousand of the<br>world's best athletes<br>who poured everything that they have<br>into basically uh maybe a one day a<br>couple days a couple weeks of<br>performance and so<br>um listening to guys like brett you know<br>steve and brad all of these guys have<br>these massive planning schedules every<br>day is worked out for years and years in<br>advance to build up to something like<br>that and so<br>to be able to see them<br>kind of that payoff when you actually<br>get there it's it's something special<br>and it's not just the spectacle but it's<br>like all of the work that you've poured<br>in for years and years and that's just<br>as a coach like<br>that doesn't involve like the athletes<br>working day in and day out you know<br>wanting to spew from a training session<br>and then<br>you know you're staring down four more<br>years of something like that every day<br>day in and day out so just the the<br>amazing level of preparation like it's<br>hard to even understand um how much work<br>goes into something like that<br>and um<br>people on this call are some of the best<br>to do it i mean obviously the the<br>results kind of speak for themselves<br>with the different teams that brett and<br>steven have worked with<br>with brad to be able to pull down the<br>gold medal and for us a silver medal<br>like that's<br>that's unbelievable<br>how much<br>payoff there was for all the work that<br>went into that<br>and so for me to be able to jump in like<br>i said i'd kind of been around the<br>organization for two years<br>there had been someone else in my role<br>blair mills<br>a great strength and conditioning coach<br>to work with the sevens for years<br>he<br>was able to pick up another opportunity<br>before this and so that allowed me to<br>step into my current role<br>um and i guess just kind of thinking<br>about what brad was saying um<br>before is that<br>you know the spectacle and the<br>excitement but<br>it's<br>you take a step back and we'd actually<br>been in australia for a month before we<br>when we went to tokyo and so we'd kind<br>of been in this like on the road every<br>day every hour was like scheduled it's<br>like 6 a.m wake up get moving 8 a.m<br>breakfast 10 a.m training 12 p.m or 12<br>you know recovery so every hour of the<br>day is scheduled right up until night<br>whether you're calling or meeting with<br>people or trying to figure out plans and<br>like brett said plant a b and c<br>all falling through at the last minute<br>because of covet and we were locked down<br>in australia so we're really like heads<br>down at this point after being in aussie<br>for a month um<br>everything's planned we're in this<br>routine where it's just bang bang bang<br>every day<br>um and so we finally get to the village<br>and it's kind of the same thing like<br>it's it's early mornings<br>stephen should talk about his schedule a<br>bit more because he was basically<br>looking after everyone but<br>um<br>up really early all the way through all<br>the emotional effort that goes into the<br>actual performance the actual<br>competition<br>the wind down it's a late night then<br>you're back at it the next morning<br>so you kind of get into this routine<br>where you're just rolling along rolling<br>along rolling along and then you do have<br>these moments though where you just take<br>a breath and it's like whoa like i'm<br>actually here like i'm actually at the<br>olympic games and like brad was saying<br>like for me a moment came like i<br>followed nba basketball so i'm just<br>going to lunch i have like a 20 minute<br>window before we're training and so i'm<br>actually running to lunch to make it on<br>time right and like so everything's<br>happening quickly but i'm riding the<br>escalator up to where the food hall is<br>and i see yao ming like going down the<br>other side like oh<br>yeah that's cool<br>i get to the top of the the top of the<br>escalator i turn right and then it's the<br>gasal brothers mark and pal gasol like<br>right at the top like they're heading<br>down it's like whoa those are the slow<br>brothers and i have a seat<br>and i think it's jason tatum's on the<br>other side of the table along with luka<br>doncic and it's like these guys i just<br>passed like<br>almost a billion dollars worth of like<br>nba salary money walking into lunch like<br>this is amazing what's going on here<br>pinch me i don't think this is real<br>so you just see like the wide range of<br>people and like you know it was just the<br>the nba practice probably just got over<br>right like it's not actually that big of<br>a deal in that context but<br>you take a breath and you open your eyes<br>around what's going on like oh yeah<br>there's about adam she's having a salad<br>for lunch that's pretty cool like it's<br>just super<br>routine but it's also incredible just<br>the the humans that you cross paths with<br>so that was kind of just my eye opening<br>kind of take a breath moment during the<br>games it was really special<br>obviously like winning a medal was<br>amazing um<br>we took silver and i think that was um<br>one of the most unique experiences of my<br>life i'm sitting there we see our<br>athletes up on the podium<br>argentina has just won bronze they are<br>excited they're singing they're dancing<br>they just won bronze fijians are on top<br>they were they have gold medals around<br>their neck they're singing they're<br>dancing<br>and then you look at our guys and it's<br>this real somber like kind of humble<br>mood it was just such a wild<br>like depth of the different kind of<br>reactions that can go on with the<br>olympic games like such a wide range of<br>everything that you could imagine such<br>like humble defeat the agony the the<br>excitement and the thrill of the victory<br>all in one scene<br>those are those are special and<br>obviously we wanted to win gold but<br>um to be able to experience that was<br>pretty amazing<br>thanks conor yeah<br>i can imagine yeah it must just be so<br>surreal at times and yeah being being a<br>part of experiencing those emotions<br>alongside those people that you form<br>those relationships with really special<br>and i did wanted to cycle back to<br>something i think you'd all sort of<br>mentioned around uh<br>yeah i just wanted to give say thank you<br>from us because there's a lot of<br>sacrifice you talked about the early<br>mornings and the training and all the<br>all of the effort that uh you guys uh<br>spend you that you guys are the team<br>behind the team<br>uh yeah i just wanted to say obviously<br>we're really proud of you guys and<br>yeah i wanted to say that we really<br>appreciate the work you do i mean<br>brett's he's still not able to get back<br>into the country and see his family and<br>friends so you know the time you spend<br>away from those people that are uh close<br>and dear to you um yeah just want to say<br>uh the final sort of uh question there<br>is just uh i think we'll start with you<br>steve uh can you just sort of talk about<br>a little bit uh hopefully something<br>positive about uh something uh that the<br>other relationship with the university<br>something positive you reckon marty yeah<br>yeah um<br>i did give you these questions in<br>advance so hopefully you've been able to<br>come up with something yeah like his<br>yeah well<br>i mean<br>my role i suppose been has been<br>pretty deeply involved in both camps i<br>suppose being um phd with the um at<br>university atom center there so<br>yeah look it has been it has been great<br>i think it's like<br>working across like to touch on the atom<br>center i suppose it's massively unique<br>to be able to do well not massively<br>unique like it happens a lot i guess an<br>aussie with uh ais and things but<br>i think in new zealand to be able to do<br>a phd a research project in a<br>in a place like mount monganoui um at<br>the adams centre<br>was pretty unique for new zealand and<br>and that really suited me as a person to<br>to be able to like<br>i think i've only been to the university<br>once the university of waikato in<br>hamilton um and you know so to be able<br>to do a phd<br>in a non-traditional sense and not<br>really be<br>at a university and in that kind of<br>routine<br>uh it's been<br>pretty great it obviously has its<br>challenges with um<br>i suppose different access to different<br>things but<br>um the the center over there is a really<br>cool little spot and it's got great<br>facilities for the things that we do<br>uh with the environmental chamber and a<br>little lab there and um<br>really good recovery space out the back<br>and an excellent um strength training<br>facility so<br>yeah i'd say that would be the the<br>biggest positive i could say and then<br>and working with you guys as well marty<br>and um<br>in particular and and kim alongside um<br>always willing to to support i suppose<br>to shout out to marty he was never<br>really meant to be<br>uh on my project to start with i suppose<br>and then um six months in we realised<br>that<br>um<br>we're a bit short on the ground in terms<br>of<br>people that could actually help uh in a<br>day-to-day sense so<br>yeah a massive shout out to you marty<br>for but jumping on and lending your<br>expertise obviously you've been around<br>rugby and um<br>in sport and academia and so i<br>understand each side of it so<br>um<br>i've still got a little bit to go so<br>hopefully you can help out on that as<br>well but um<br>yeah uh yeah shout out to you guys there<br>as well the adams<br>um oh and probably on the back end of it<br>as well i think doing um<br>being involved in that kind of place and<br>and<br>having other students like connor and we<br>had a guy<br>frank from italy um and ivana um it was<br>a a really cool crew that we kind of had<br>there to<br>we're all doing different projects with<br>different kind of<br>teams but it was cool to share that<br>experience with um<br>kind of people from all around the world<br>you know that were on a similar path so<br>yeah it's been pretty special<br>cool<br>yeah a massive messer for me um<br>at a whole lot of levels<br>um firstly as an academic staff i'm<br>tenured academic staff i was able to<br>pick up contracts<br>from the moment i started and<br>and to<br>work in an applied sense the university<br>saw the value of allowing me not just to<br>be an academic publishing sort of<br>working teaching and doing theoretical<br>research but also be able to work um<br>consultancy so<br>um<br>i mean<br>they made a bit of money out of it which<br>helped as well too but i just i just<br>can't thank university enough for<br>allowing me the opportunity to do the<br>things that i did<br>i was embedded in the new zealand rowing<br>program for over a decade while also<br>working as an academia academic<br>the second side is is that<br>a lot of the things that i have done<br>that i've introduced into the various<br>sports that i've been involved with is<br>on the back of<br>science and and i've not always done the<br>science myself so i've had a number of<br>post-grad students that i've uh<br>who've worked collaboratively through<br>other universities or through waikato<br>university that have had a major impact<br>in the innovations that i use<br>that have given me the opportunity to<br>work all around the world in rugby and<br>and in a multiple international rowing<br>programs<br>um so<br>you know um<br>again i just can't thank the university<br>enough for that as well so for me<br>personally<br>um<br>you know<br>the the university of waikato is you<br>know the reason i'm here basically doing<br>what i'm doing so i can't thank them<br>enough<br>thanks uh<br>connor<br>yeah so one of the big draws for me<br>coming to new zealand to do a phd in the<br>first place was<br>the<br>international reputation that this part<br>of the world carries along with it and i<br>think that i've talked to people<br>students in the community or just<br>um other sports kind of practitioners<br>and it's almost this kind of idea that<br>people don't actually know how good it<br>is down here um<br>it's like you tell people like oh yeah<br>like new zealand australia like these<br>two countries known around the world for<br>their innovation<br>and<br>partly in<br>uh<br>thanks to work from people like bread<br>and<br>other people within different<br>universities here<br>so<br>the reputation is what brought me down<br>here and then it delivers because<br>immediately you get to be able to be<br>immersed in environments like the high<br>performance center here and<br>in in the mount and<br>you get the opportunity to actually do<br>research that matters in an applied<br>sense so brett mentioned kind of the<br>theoretical side but<br>you look at<br>like for me i was looking at other<br>opportunities back in the us and<br>in different countries and it involves<br>like years and years of coursework<br>before you're even<br>standing in front of an athlete<br>um but from here from my experience with<br>this program at the university of<br>waikato it was<br>day one i had opportunities to to apply<br>my trade as a strength and conditioning<br>coach and then also<br>work to then be<br>innovative and bring the science side<br>that will help push the entire industry<br>forward and that's<br>where it's going um you know five ten<br>years ago a master's degree was like<br>pretty cutting edge stuff like knowing<br>no one had a master's degree even you<br>know before then maybe but just within<br>the last 10 years and now it's the field<br>is accelerating things are being<br>discovered new things are being<br>challenged and approached in exciting<br>ways and so this university is part of<br>that process and<br>what's going on in the industry as a<br>whole so<br>being a part of that process has been<br>pretty special and it's allowed me to<br>grow as a practitioner and<br>get my feet into the academia kind of<br>thanks connor<br>and brad<br>best for last<br>i can't really talk around my<br>relationship with with mike you know i'm<br>an aut graduate<br>um but then if i if i look at<br>the crew of support people that i had<br>around us<br>and and i probably<br>don't speak about it enough but retail<br>sports scientist<br>he's had a huge impact on our team over<br>the last sort of 18 months and then not<br>only our team and our athletes but my<br>learning as well and so again i've been<br>a rugby for 13 years but the amount of<br>learning that's happened just for me<br>professionally over the last 18 months<br>because of brett's direct import it's<br>been huge um stephen was our obviously a<br>ph<br>phd student initially but then<br>he was a huge part of our<br>our heat strategy our heat acclimation<br>prior to going to the olympics and we<br>trialled a number of things<br>which stephen was a huge part of<br>some of the good some of them were bad<br>but once we tried everything and we were<br>like you said there was plans a b c and<br>d but you know we had ruled out a number<br>of options that weren't going to be<br>useful thanks to thanks to stephen's he<br>and and<br>him and marty<br>put in a huge shift during those trials<br>you know you got 21 contract athletes<br>you're trying a number of strategies in<br>the environmental chamber and it just<br>doesn't happen without<br>manpower on the ground being able to run<br>heart rate you know take lactate<br>measures et cetera et cetera and<br>actually run the actual protocols itself<br>so that probably wasn't my role um but<br>having that support on the ground<br>allowed me then to just continue our<br>regular development with our coaches<br>because stephen and marty were in the<br>chamber pretty much losing 10 kgs a day<br>anymore and marty would have faded away<br>um<br>and then and then obviously<br>last but not least like conor<br>may been in our program only for<br>a couple years now but again the amount<br>of learning that i've i've had from you<br>as a practitioner so again been doing it<br>for 13 years i thought i was pretty<br>comfortable in my own skin and then you<br>come along and<br>you know bring up all the blind spots<br>that i have in terms of strength and<br>power you know so the impact you've had<br>on our girls and and when you when you<br>put it all together<br>in terms of the three lads that helped<br>us directly from waikato<br>you can be pretty proud that our olympic<br>gold medal with the woman's program was<br>largely influenced by the three boys<br>that have have come from their white<br>castle uni background so just uh just a<br>just a huge thank you from from me and<br>our support staff and our athletes and<br>our management to you and waikato uni<br>for your support i suppose over the<br>course of the last not in the last<br>couple years but last five years since<br>i've been involved<br>it's any of the you know students that<br>are thinking about doing a phd<br>like i said the atom center itself so<br>you've got men's and women's servants<br>you've got their plenty right but you've<br>got david nico the boxer who's sort of<br>popping across every now and then you've<br>got our sprint cyclists coming
