accurate.</p><p>welcome everybody to the master nursing<br>science information evening i'm sorry<br>that we can't be doing this in person as<br>anticipated but um great to have the<br>opportunity to do it virtually<br>um i'm just going to give you a wee bit<br>of a<br>excuse me while i keep my teamwork him<br>but we<br>a bit of an outline of what hashtag is<br>going to go so we're going to talk um<br>myself virginia jones and chris moyer<br>will outline and discuss the academic<br>clinical aspects of the program<br>and then we're very lucky to have alana<br>duncan and laura barnett who are both in<br>their final year of the mass nursing<br>science program who are going to come<br>and talk about their student experience<br>and then i'm going to show a short video<br>on the simulation suite to give you an<br>idea what the campus looks like in the<br>simulation suite<br>and at the end there'll be an<br>so the master nursing science<br>program was the first pre-registration<br>master's program of its kind in new<br>zealand and it's been going since 2016.<br>and today we've had 100 success rate for<br>graduates registering as an rn and about<br>a 97 percent um have secured jobs as rns<br>post graduate post the course<br>so the bro the program is actually<br>taught here in christchurch at the<br>center for postgraduate nursing and<br>that's at 72 oxford terrace which is<br>just um in town basically a block over<br>from valentine's if you know<br>christchurch<br>it's also just down the road from<br>christchurch hospital<br>and christchurch hospital is the largest<br>tertiary hospital in the south island<br>and is the major trauma center<br>for the northern and central canterbury<br>so a lot of our students take undertake<br>clinical placements in the canterbury<br>dhb<br>so otago university and you guys will<br>know this because most of you are from<br>uh actually in otago university at the<br>moment but i'll just give you a bit of<br>um outline italian university is around<br>21 000 students and they'll cross five<br>main campuses in new zealand and you<br>guys will know because you've come from<br>the dunedin campus of course but there's<br>also a campus in auckland christchurch<br>which is the campus that we're on in the<br>cargill and wellington<br>and as you'll know it is one of the only<br>two medical schools in new zealand um<br>and our medical school sits within a<br>large health science division which is<br>also where the centre for postgraduate<br>nursing sits within<br>and this health science division has a<br>strong reputation for teaching and<br>research excellence<br>the center for postgraduate nursing is<br>ranked in the top 100 nursing schools in<br>the world as per qsr rating<br>and has highly qualified academics who<br>are research active and maintain strong<br>links with the clinical sector with a<br>number of our academics um having joint<br>positions with the canterbury district<br>health board<br>the university provides technology<br>enhanced learning and teaching including<br>a high quality simulation centre that is<br>on the christchurch campus and in the<br>same building as the center for<br>postgraduate nursing<br>due to the aging workforce which is 91<br>are aged over 50 years or over almost 20<br>percent of them are over uh six years or<br>older<br>in an aging population there is a<br>national nursing shortage<br>the picture is similar internationally<br>according to the international council<br>of nurses it is predicted that 13<br>million nurses will be needed to fill<br>the global nursing shortage in the<br>future<br>so if you guys decide to undertake the<br>master nursing science program and<br>become a registered nurse you'll be<br>joining a profession that is in high<br>so the master nursing science program<br>as i said it's the first program of its<br>kind in new zealand and it's a<br>pre-registration master's program so the<br>notion is that you're coming in to do<br>this two-year full-time program<br>and at a master's level and then you're<br>eligible to become a registered nurse at<br>the state final<br>as you know on that website it's open to<br>graduates from any discipline so it<br>doesn't matter if you come from a<br>science background if you come from an<br>arts background a communist background<br>any background as as long as you've got<br>a b average in the last two years of<br>your undergraduate degree you're<br>eligible to apply<br>it's a reasonably flexible program and<br>that we have class teaching um and on<br>campus and in the rest of the time is<br>self-directed learning and<br>alan will tell you a wee bit about her<br>experience with that<br>the clinical placements are available<br>throughout the south island and chris<br>will talk to those a wee bit later but<br>the notion is that if we do offer<br>clinical placements throughout the south<br>island so if you happen to be in dunedin<br>we can offer clinical placements down<br>there<br>you have access the state of the art<br>simulation center simulation happens<br>every tuesday afternoon in the first<br>year while you're in class and that's an<br>opportunity for you to learn clinical<br>skills before you go out into the<br>clinical environment<br>um<br>page<br>so<br>steps to become a registered nurse so<br>you need to complete this program within<br>four years then on<br>successful completion you're eligible to<br>set the national nursing licensure exam<br>and this is set by the new zealand<br>nursing council which is the nursing<br>which is the nursing regulatory body<br>so once you've passed the exam you are<br>then um able to work as a rich nurse<br>within<br>the new zealand health system and this<br>can be in the tertiary sector the<br>primary sector<br>private clinics private hospitals and<br>that's just to name a few you can also<br>work within australia we have a trans<br>testament agreement so you're eligible<br>so we don't have the most up-to-date<br>tuition fees for next year but what i<br>can give you is the tuition fees for<br>this year so for 2021 for domestic<br>students so those students that are new<br>zealand residents or new zealand<br>citizens the fees were eleven thousand<br>eleven hundred and<br>eleven thousand one hundred and twelve<br>dollars a year<br>and for uh for international students<br>it's forty two thousand two<br>one a year<br>there are also some other course related<br>costs such as uniform um you have to be<br>fully immunized before you come in so<br>there's there might be costs with<br>immunisations<br>there are text books we also have a 280<br>student services levy which i think you<br>guys will probably all used to paying in<br>your undergraduate um student fees<br>and there also might be some costs<br>so i'm going to talk to the in-class<br>side of the program so as i said before<br>it's a two-year intensive full-time<br>course in which you complete 13<br>compulsory papers over the two years<br>now this program only has one intake a<br>year in february and students took the<br>state exam in november the following<br>year so even though we say it's two<br>years it's a very intensive program and<br>actually you only get about five weeks<br>over the december break<br>so it's a it's a very um shortened<br>it's a two-year sort of an 18-month<br>program over so these two years<br>because it's master's level um the<br>face-to-face teaching is only across two<br>days and that's usually monday and<br>tuesday in year one and tuesday and<br>wednesday in year two<br>and and it is expected that that for the<br>rest of the week you'll be undertaking<br>self-directed learning<br>there are a number of clinically focused<br>papers such as altered health care<br>states which teaches students about<br>looking after people with surgical or<br>medical issues<br>mental health paper which focuses on<br>mental health conditions and management<br>is also a complex care paper which<br>teaches students about caring for<br>individuals who might have a number of<br>health conditions or undergoing<br>rehabilitation<br>there are also a number of papers that<br>focus on health policy and in the new<br>zealand context<br>there are also three science papers and<br>as i said before because we take<br>students from any undergraduate degree<br>we teach all the aspects of the nursing<br>that you need<br>to know to become a registered nurse so<br>it doesn't matter that you don't come<br>as long as students pass the papers they<br>can progress through the course<br>and there are part-time options<br>available and if this is something you<br>wish to consider it's best to organize<br>an appointment with me and we will work<br>through an individual program study that<br>best suits your circumstances i'm going<br>to now turn it over to chris thanks<br>chris<br>hello i'm chris moyer i'm the clinical<br>coordinator for the masters of nursing<br>science and based here in christchurch<br>so jenny's told you about some of the<br>placements that<br>we offer acute care mental health<br>complex care<br>we usually<br>start the first placement though in the<br>first year pretty quickly we have<br>students out already by april<br>having commenced in february and that's<br>for a two week aged residential care<br>placement so and that's fully supported<br>with an academic staff member with the<br>students with a group of about six<br>students in a facility<br>so<br>then they move on quite quickly then in<br>june july into a primary health<br>placement so in the community somewhere<br>in either a gp practice or an ngo a<br>non-governmental organization such as a<br>can breathe or which focuses on um<br>respiratory care or something<br>out in the community with people which i<br>think is a really good time to have that<br>placement<br>then uh as well as those other<br>placements so in all these six<br>placements<br>the others the primary health acute care<br>mental health and complex cure all five<br>week placements uh across the<br>first and second year and then the last<br>placement is a nine week<br>what we call capstone placement so<br>that's your transition or consolidation<br>placement a in a longer placement that<br>nursing council wants to see students do<br>before they qualify so before they sit<br>their state final exam and go on to<br>register<br>so all of the placements are supported<br>with both clinical we have a good<br>relationship with the clinical areas so<br>there'll be clinical preceptors or<br>clinical liaison nurses assigned to<br>support you in the clinical practice and<br>then we also<br>sorry um we also<br>we also support you with academic staff<br>members uh in each placement uh who work<br>with you and see you every week and uh<br>are there to um really make that link<br>between what you're learning in class<br>and what you're learning in the clinical<br>environment<br>so<br>information across the papers is<br>scaffolded so you're building on your<br>skills and knowledge across the<br>placements<br>we do place students across the south<br>island for the most part we place<br>students in the canterbury dhb and<br>in dunedin in the southern dhb i have<br>placed students in<br>cromwell dunedin nelson<br>west coast so you know i'm really open<br>to placing students wherever they want<br>to be<br>and<br>in order to do that though there's often<br>some costs as ginny was saying<br>associated with that that might be<br>travel<br>it might be<br>accommodation uh so that's why i<br>encourage students if they have family<br>somewhere or know people somewhere that<br>they would like to go that they asked<br>you know about preps if they can stay<br>for a period of a placement just to give<br>them some<br>experience in other areas<br>so i think that's about all i've got to<br>say at this point jenny<br>thanks chris<br>it's going to this<br>okay and i'm just going to pass you over<br>to um alana and laura so as i said<br>before lana's going to talk to you about<br>her experience of the muslim students<br>crime from an academic perspective so<br>she'll start and then laura will talk<br>about her clinical experience<br>thanks alana<br>hey so um yeah i'm alanna um one of the<br>second final year um<br>nursing students um<br>i guess<br>yeah from my perspective i would just<br>reiterate what jenny said about this<br>you learn a lot in the um<br>the two years<br>and<br>um while you only have two days in in<br>class and with<br>face to face there's a lot of work that<br>needs to go in outside of class but i<br>mean it is what you i make of it um so<br>it is very self-defect directed um it's<br>not like an undergraduate where<br>you are spoon fed you're definitely<br>taught things but time management uh<br>and self-motivation and being serious is<br>definitely important if you don't want<br>to<br>uh<br>suddenly find things piling up and<br>that's something that uh our class has<br>had to learn um<br>which<br>you know it's part of the journey and<br>it's yeah it's been<br>fun but it's definitely important to try<br>and chip away at it um<br>i think<br>class i come from a science background<br>so my undergraduate degree was in<br>neuroscience and<br>i had a minor in linguistics and did<br>some other arts papers as well which i<br>think has been been really beneficial<br>because<br>you the style of writing um<br>i think the<br>my arts papers have um helped with the<br>style of writing within um assignments<br>over the master of nursing science but<br>um then my major has definitely helped<br>learn<br>um the science side of<br>nursing so<br>um<br>you know fellow classmates who come from<br>non-science backgrounds have struggled a<br>little bit<br>with the with just<br>relearning um i suppose the science<br>language um but that's not to say that<br>it's not possible um laura can attest<br>that it's possible<br>um<br>but yes i think it's i think it is a big<br>step if you are coming from a<br>non-science background but it's<br>definitely possible and the value of<br>um coming from arts or commerce is huge<br>because<br>you bring<br>um your personality and your experience<br>to being a nurse<br>um<br>yeah<br>um<br>i definitely would say that there's help<br>available if you need it and not to<br>hesitate to ask them i think it is<br>important to ask<br>um because you do need to advocate for<br>yourself and if you're struggling there<br>is no point<br>um just wallowing because then you<br>really get into a sticky situation<br>and yeah lecturers are really supportive<br>if um you need help<br>um<br>also<br>i think<br>uh<br>yeah it's important to draw from your<br>other classmates as well um in terms of<br>academic um support and just you know<br>band together and that but i think<br>overall it's been quite positive i've<br>personally really enjoyed the<br>research side of it which is<br>part of our second<br>as a<br>full year paper um in your second year<br>um it does start at the end of your<br>first year<br>um and i've looked at how<br>nurses in acute stroke unit um have<br>found using guidelines for providing<br>care um so it is it is a small scope but<br>it's definitely been um an enjoyable<br>process from myself<br>um and there's lots of opportunities um<br>to<br>sort of<br>uh like there's heaps of options for um<br>the research project as well often<br>you'll find that supervisors<br>um will<br>suggest projects that they think would<br>be good um but if you<br>none of them sort of<br>take your fantasy you can come up with<br>your own one as well which is what i did<br>and they are open to that as well so um<br>yeah i think<br>um if you guys have questions at the end<br>then i'm happy that i was gonna answer<br>those i think that's yeah my experience<br>from the academic side<br>hey yeah um my name's laura and i'm also<br>in the same class as alanna in the<br>second year um yeah so i<br>thanks alana for talking about the um<br>the academic side of things and i'm here<br>to talk about the clinical side of<br>things um oh yeah just on the academic<br>side as well i come from a<br>bachelor of arts background<br>um<br>so yeah i can definitely agree with<br>alana that um<br>you know it doesn't matter which<br>background you come from this is a<br>master's degree for everyone who's<br>interested in entering into nursing and<br>interested at doing things at a master's<br>level at the same time<br>so yeah definitely made the science a<br>bit more challenging but<br>i'm really glad that i've got the<br>writing experience from my bachelor of<br>arts<br>um so yeah more about the<br>clinical experience i loved the six<br>clinical um<br>experiences so we started off with age<br>residential care just for a couple weeks<br>so<br>um<br>everyone in the class was in an age<br>residential facility<br>and<br>that was starting off<br>you know all in similar kind of areas so<br>the following<br>clinical experiences after that we all<br>started branching off into different<br>areas um<br>and we got to sort of pick our interests<br>a little bit more if there were spaces<br>available<br>but with age residential care it was a<br>really great place to start because<br>we all had slightly more similar<br>experiences and<br>um<br>an aging population is really<br>um important in new zealand it's<br>something that's that's current and<br>happening so it was a really great great<br>place to start and i personally love<br>working with older people um<br>i found it really like humbling and<br>really interesting<br>uh there's also a lot of where we were<br>mostly working in the hospital level<br>care of age residential facilities<br>so we were working um<br>you know directly with the nurse um and<br>we had a lot more support so we were<br>doing things more in a group and and<br>learning that way whereas in the<br>following placements we were<br>separated out and doing things more um<br>you know individually with one-on-one<br>with nurses<br>uh so yeah in that one i learned a lot<br>about like dementia different<br>comorbidities and aging<br>um polypharmacy when um<br>age people are taking<br>multiple drugs at the same time multiple<br>medications um<br>also common things like diabetes or<br>you know heart disease lung diseases<br>things like that<br>and then the second one<br>second placement was primary health or<br>community health<br>i was really lucky i got to try a few<br>different things so i spent a few weeks<br>with waitaha primary health organization<br>and so from there i got to see like the<br>overview<br>of how<br>health works in<br>a cdhp or within a primary health<br>organization so<br>how it's actually the ministry of health<br>funding<br>channels down and how it's allocated out<br>to gps based on the needs of different<br>areas<br>i got to do sort of one-off interesting<br>things like before school checks and<br>work with lactation consultants<br>i got to work with<br>a special services for maori health or<br>for pacifica health and go and visit<br>people and families in their houses um<br>and work with like<br>specific individual needs across<br>different socioeconomic areas of<br>christchurch so that was really really<br>interesting and like working with<br>different cultural groups<br>and then i had a couple weeks in some gp<br>clinics after that and that was really<br>great as well for getting really<br>hands-on and getting to do some<br>vaccinations and<br>um<br>yeah<br>a lot more<br>hands-on work and patient education and<br>stuff like that so that was working a<br>lot more one-on-one with the nurse and<br>um and sitting through the consultations<br>and also the doctor's consultation is<br>really interesting<br>and then the third<br>placement was medical surgical or acute<br>care that was in the hospital for me so<br>i was luckily placed in the stroke unit<br>in christchurch public which was amazing<br>they had a bit of general medical as<br>well and the teamwork in the hospital<br>was just<br>fascinating to see<br>um i think each ward is totally<br>different and they have you know<br>different dynamics going on and<br>different team<br>team styles and things um but i was<br>really happy with the what i was on<br>i think they've since moved to the new<br>hospital um so it's changed a little bit<br>since when i was there but um that was<br>fascinating especially to work in such a<br>specialized area such as stroke i got to<br>learn<br>a lot about really specific like what<br>happens when someone comes in with a<br>stroke you know they're brought in by an<br>ambulance and then they have to be<br>mobilized really quickly to get the you<br>know um<br>assessments that they need to find out<br>what kind of stroke they've had if<br>they've had one or not and then what<br>happens after that they're sort of<br>treatment and it's very fast-paced and<br>very fascinating uh and then into our i<br>believe it was in our say beginning of<br>second year end of i've lost track now<br>um we did a mental health placement<br>which i also really loved elana and i<br>were actually on the same mental health<br>placement and it was so interesting how<br>from our different backgrounds and our<br>different experiences how we had such a<br>different experience on<br>you know at the same place um and it<br>just goes to show that you know<br>different nurses are different or to be<br>nurses are different um and we all have<br>our um you know different interests and<br>what suits us and what doesn't and<br>that's why<br>i really enjoyed this course for<br>um<br>having such different experiences<br>and being able to see if it wasn't for<br>all these different placements i<br>wouldn't have such a good idea about<br>knowing um what kind of areas i'd like<br>to get into<br>um so yeah mental health was really<br>fascinating that was with<br>working with people with sort of<br>longer-term long-standing mental health<br>issues<br>who have come from a hospital setting<br>but they're not quite ready to go into<br>the community or maybe they've gone into<br>the community it hasn't worked out so<br>they need a sort of longer term<br>supported<br>residential<br>style<br>rehabilitation support so and some of<br>them had moments of quite um acute<br>mental health issues so that was really<br>fascinating to be a part of and i was<br>like all of these placements have really<br>honored that to be<br>um a part of these people's lives you<br>know um especially when they're in such<br>a vulnerable scenario<br>um and then the second to last one was<br>complex care<br>um so i was working in a um<br>like neuro facility so um with traumatic<br>brain injuries traumatic spinal injury<br>patients and also with um<br>patients who have had or they were<br>called residents really because they<br>were living living there long term<br>um they had neurodegenerative diseases<br>like uh multiple sclerosis or motor<br>neurone or huntington's and they were<br>really really interesting um<br>uh all the different transfers involved<br>and the hoist um<br>for you know people who<br>were um paraplegic or tetraplegic and<br>what then involved and um<br>also different brain functions and um<br>yeah learned a lot there a lot from like<br>the support worker care people as well<br>as the nurses<br>um and then the final one is<br>consolidation um so that's the nine week<br>placement and yeah there is a bit more<br>choice around that so that's something<br>that's worth<br>earlier on in the placements starting to<br>think about<br>what interests you the most in the<br>placements and where you'd like to be in<br>the future<br>but nursing is you're never stuck in any<br>particular area um there's always<br>options to<br>to change so<br>um<br>i'm not too worried about wherever i go<br>for my consolidation i'm not worried<br>that i'm going to be stuck there for the<br>rest of my nursing career i know that um<br>there's lots of options to change so<br>yeah that's my clinical experiences<br>thanks so much laura i'm just going to<br>now um share the screen and provide and<br>do a video for the sun center<br>welcome to the university of otago<br>christchurch simulation center my name<br>is darlene i'm one of the lecturing<br>um<br>jenny i don't think that sounds working<br>skills training right the way through to<br>we do we do very little uh didactic<br>teaching here<br>most of our stuff is hands-on but we do<br>use this room a little bit for<br>short presentations but also principally<br>for<br>debriefing students<br>so we live stream our scenarios<br>from the areas where they take place<br>through to these two these two screens<br>here where most of the students in the<br>class will be watching from so this room<br>is set up really to<br>look<br>like a gps<br>room or an outpatient clinic room<br>um we use this room<br>for<br>simulating difficult consultations<br>and we also do<br>some intimate examinations in here as<br>well<br>dealing with the important issues of<br>communicating effectively with patients<br>who are about to undergo sensitive<br>examinations this is our hospital board<br>this is our patient who's in here at the<br>moment charlie<br>just catching up on a bit of sleep here<br>and we simulate uh ward patient<br>scenarios in here um<br>we would work with our colleagues in the<br>pediatric department um using<br>charlie who's a fully computerized<br>mannequin<br>simulator six-year-old boy<br>and<br>yeah so we use this room for<br>a range of sessions including uh serious<br>illness conversations working with dying<br>patients<br>breaking bad news to people<br>as well as some work on sort of general<br>general award<br>situations that our students may come<br>across we use this room for mainly for<br>procedural skills training i've got the<br>room set up for some teaching i'm doing<br>tomorrow on how to give injections and<br>how to collect arterial blood gas<br>samples<br>um as you can see we have a full range<br>of<br>models<br>and we try to<br>make sure that we adhere closely to good<br>practice guidelines so sharps containers<br>and hygiene provision throughout the<br>room<br>and typically the students will be<br>working to<br>evidence best checklists that<br>we've developed over the last few years<br>and they'll be at least one often two<br>faculty here working closely with<br>students on helping them to improve<br>their technique<br>so um we are now in the control room uh<br>from here you can see the<br>simulation suite we'll go through there<br>very shortly but to introduce this room<br>and this is really where um what our<br>scenario directing is from where<br>um<br>all the technical activities that<br>support our simulations are conducted<br>from we have uh technicians who actually<br>help us to run all of the audio visual<br>equipment and also our fully<br>computerized<br>simulator you can see behind me on the<br>bed there alex and this is the<br>simulation suite<br>this is a room where we simulate a lot<br>of high acuity situations so<br>we use this room sometimes as an<br>emergency department room<br>as a recovery room<br>sometimes we convert the whole room into<br>an operating theater<br>um and we<br>usually work on our patients here alex<br>who takes on a number of different<br>guises of a number of different<br>presentations<br>um he's fully computerized he's operated<br>from the control room that we've just<br>been in<br>and his final signs his technical<br>parameters will change depending on the<br>program that we set<br>and the interventions that the students<br>carry out on him<br>so if the students make good clinical<br>decisions and um and make the right<br>interventions then alex's vital signs<br>will change<br>um he has capacity for us to listen to<br>his chest hear a whole range of lung<br>sounds heart sounds<br>uh listen to his bowel sounds<br>he'll have a fill up seizures he'll<br>sweat bleed<br>to a whole range of things he'll talk to<br>us<br>given the right prompts<br>and so we had the opportunity to both uh<br>adjust his<br>clinical parameters um to replicate an<br>illness or a huge presentation<br>and to respond to the expenses that the<br>students carry out on him<br>so we're now back in the tutorial room<br>for our structured debrief following the<br>scenario that we've just undertaken in<br>the<br>simulation suite<br>our students are back here and<br>they're going to form a central part of<br>an educational discussion<br>which looks at<br>the actions they took<br>the way they organize themselves as a<br>team the decisions they<br>made clinically<br>and the consequences of those decisions<br>for our simulator<br>patient alex simulation as part of<br>healthcare education is internationally<br>recognized now as being an essential<br>part<br>of what we do it's an aspect of the<br>curriculum that is consistently well<br>evaluated in fact we often have to run<br>additional sessions for students who opt<br>to come back and do some further<br>practice with us<br>we look forward to seeing you back here<br>at the simulation center when you begin<br>your program and<br>look forward to helping you<br>along your journey<br>okay so just like to um open it up now<br>if you i think you just tap them in and<br>i can actually see some of these<br>questions myself so i wonder if i should<br>just go through them<br>um<br>so one question is is it possible to<br>work whilst completing the course<br>now um<br>this is something that chris moyer and i<br>often talk to and i'm sure chris might<br>want to um add something to this as well<br>so the clinical um<br>we don't take a role for um people being<br>in class but we definitely keep an eye<br>on clinical hours so you it's the<br>nursing council mandates you do at least<br>1100 hours of clinical so you<br>have to be able to commit to completing<br>the clinical hours<br>doing shift work as well as part of<br>those clinical hours so<br>some people some students do choose to<br>work while they're competing the course<br>as we have indicated before it is a<br>full-time intensive course so um some<br>people are able to manage and juggle<br>that<br>and some<br>are able to alter their work hours to<br>accommodate for the clinical so that's<br>that would be at the end of the day we<br>can't say yes or no it is up to the<br>individual i might paint over to chris<br>because chris has probably some insight<br>in that as well from her perspective<br>this is the work question jenny yes yep<br>okay and then i'll go on to the next one<br>about placements outside<br>um<br>i think what we've found is that people<br>can work a couple of days and lana and<br>laura might<br>have more knowledge of this from their<br>classmates and things it's where people<br>have a family and are also working and<br>also doing the course somehow those<br>three things can really push people over<br>so<br>yeah<br>so you can usually do the course<br>if that's all you're doing and do a<br>couple of days at least work<br>um<br>yeah<br>but as alana very clearly alluded to it<br>it's quite a full-on course what do you<br>think alana about working<br>um personally because i am only<br>responsible for myself um<br>in my first year i was able to regularly<br>work<br>um<br>a<br>wrap i suppose between 12 and 20 hours a<br>week it definitely adds stress<br>um and i know a lot of classmates also<br>probably worked um also worked part-time<br>i<br>found i<br>attempted to work a couple of weekends<br>um on clinical placement and very<br>quickly found that it wasn't a good idea<br>so<br>i think you definitely if you are<br>working<br>make sure that you're<br>got a<br>either casual or have a boss that's<br>quite willing to um that you step out<br>during clinical i think that's probably<br>my<br>uh main advice um because<br>i<br>it was yeah i know those who had also<br>worked during clinical from what i heard<br>found that<br>it was you know it's just a step too far<br>um so yeah be wise but it is muslim<br>that's right because if you're working<br>say five weeks full time and then you<br>and you alter your work time to be<br>working in the weekends as well<br>you might solidly be working for five<br>weeks which is pretty tough<br>so um<br>and the question there about<br>if there are clinical placements outside<br>of term time<br>you probably need to talk to get the<br>timetable off sandra for that because<br>i'm not we don't really work to the<br>usual university terms<br>and for example<br>so<br>the the primary health placement<br>in the first year and the complex care<br>placement in the second year both go<br>over that june july time which is<br>usually the university holidays<br>uh the mental health placement is<br>in very early in the second year so it's<br>sort of<br>february march<br>and just before that the acute care<br>placement is also late for any sort of<br>tertiary institution it starts in early<br>november and finishes early december<br>so they are i guess they are outside of<br>normal term times if that's<br>makes sense yeah<br>um i can answer next how many students<br>do you expect to enroll in february um<br>at this stage we're not sure we don't<br>have a cap on our numbers per se<br>our cap is dictated by clinical<br>placements and clinical access so we<br>don't have a magic number at this stage<br>for um<br>for capping the program<br>i can also there's another question here<br>looking at the minimum grade as a b but<br>um usually what is the cutoff so we talk<br>about gpa being at five<br>so um<br>that is a university of otago a<br>stipulation that if someone wants to do<br>a master's they have to have a b average<br>in their last two years of an<br>undergraduate degree<br>um so we<br>will have to have a b average in their<br>degree<br>um so we usually say b however in some<br>circumstances we have<br>we have looked at a person's transcript<br>and their circumstances and what other<br>potential work experience or attributes<br>that they may have that may<br>make us consider a slightly lower<br>than b grade but we will we do want to<br>really reiterate that it is an intensive<br>program and that it is a step up the<br>notion is that it's i try and tell<br>people in orientation it's a bit like<br>when you go to um<br>to when you go to high school and then<br>you go to university there's a step up<br>and it's exactly the same as when you<br>come from an undergraduate degree and<br>postgraduate degree there is a step up<br>and that's what that's that's what it's<br>supposed to be<br>so um but we can often look at a<br>case-by-case basis around the b average<br>but we wouldn't it wouldn't be a b minus<br>it would have to be closer to a b<br>i'm cutter is currently studying health<br>sciences otago part time will affect<br>that i'm studying part-time effect my<br>eligibility role in the master's of<br>nursing program<br>not at all we'll still take we'll still<br>look at your transcript and calculate um<br>the full-time equivalent of your<br>program over the two years so we can<br>make your<br>be<br>a<br>essential grade on on on that criteria<br>so it should be fine<br>i think i've answered about the course<br>taken each year we don't have a cap per<br>se<br>um<br>we talked about students managed work or<br>study i think we've answered that<br>um<br>yes so there are two days on campus<br>face-to-face teaching<br>a week<br>and then as i said it is a full-time<br>program so each paper usually has about<br>32<br>face-to-face hours and then each paper<br>is made up of it's a 15 point paper it's<br>150 hours<br>some of that's taken up with clinical so<br>as we keep saying it is a full-time<br>program so the notion is you'd expect to<br>be<br>be working on it so monday to friday and<br>a full-time capacity<br>sometimes some people find different<br>papers<br>the concepts in them easier to grasp<br>than others so some papers may require a<br>little bit more work than others like<br>savanlana indicated potentially some<br>people from a non-science background may<br>find<br>some aspects of the science study um<br>requires a little bit more work but then<br>equally other papers they may find they<br>don't have to<br>work as hard to understand the concepts<br>because of their previous undergraduate<br>degree so it is really on an individual<br>um may i know the papers are our<br>assignments<br>i'm not quite sure what we mean by that<br>question there are assignments embedded<br>in every paper<br>and most papers most 15 point papers<br>would have at least two or three<br>assignments per paper<br>within the clinically focused paper some<br>of the assessments actually relate to<br>the clinical practice so you'll have to<br>show you're competent when you're out of<br>clinical and you get signed off as part<br>of as as being competent and no that's<br>part of an assessment<br>other other than that we have mainly<br>long assignments the only tests or exams<br>are in the science papers<br>how hard is the content for the student<br>lead learning so with the student lead<br>learning although it's self-directed um<br>academics who are in charge of each of<br>the papers do provide some online<br>it's important that if a student is<br>having issues that they get in touch<br>with a convener of the paper to see what<br>other resources are potentially<br>available<br>but there is also the expectation that a<br>student will<br>read widely around concepts within<br>papers themselves the notion of being<br>student-led but there is direction we<br>use moodle rather than blackboard as our<br>platform up here in christchurch so if<br>you've come from health sciences i think<br>you're probably used to<br>moodle but we used moodle as our<br>repository for resources that academics<br>put up to sort of guide students<br>learning<br>jenny just do you want to think hannah<br>hannah is asking so there are two dozen<br>campuses that create how many hours<br>outside of this do you feel you put into<br>studying did do hannah or laura maybe<br>want to<br>because we can't tell them<br>so what was the question<br>which question is that how many hours do<br>you feel you put into studying each week<br>other than the two days on campus<br>i think it varies each week um<br>and different people are different i'm<br>personally a procrastinator<br>i save it to the last minute but i don't<br>advise that for this course i advise as<br>alanna said to chip away<br>um<br>yeah there's quite a lot of readings<br>to do<br>like both<br>sort of assigned or recommended readings<br>and then sort of like your own<br>research and reading around a lot of the<br>topics um<br>i found initially it was kind of like a<br>learning curve for me for the science so<br>i had to<br>yeah learn the like i different<br>textbooks that are recommended some of<br>them were my bible like the science<br>textbook was just ad there was<br>pathophysiology and it was just i read<br>it like front to back throughout that<br>paper um and referred to it constantly<br>um<br>just because a lot of the concepts were<br>either like completely new to me or i'd<br>studied them a long time ago um<br>in high school or something so<br>yeah i think it depends on your previous<br>knowledge around certain<br>topic areas<br>um<br>yeah also<br>it is definitely a step up from<br>undergraduate university so<br>any<br>papers<br>any assignments we were doing<br>like the<br>sort of quality and number of references<br>required<br>for that essay are going to be a lot<br>larger than what you would be<br>doing right now in your undergraduate<br>degree so that meant just a lot more<br>reading and research yeah<br>i know you have anything um i think it's<br>also a bit of like what you make out of<br>it i mean you can yeah if you<br>you can put in a lot of time and not<br>necessarily gain a lot from it um but<br>equally if you sort of<br>yeah well you can just like not put in<br>the time and do it last minute i think i<br>would definitely recommend the textbooks<br>i never bought textbooks in my undergrad<br>because i didn't think they were<br>necessary but i found them really useful<br>um<br>in this course um<br>i would say it's<br>you know if you don't get a concept<br>like even outside of the science papers<br>if you don't understand something like<br>come back to it when you're on clinical<br>um because i find that often that makes<br>a lot more sense and then yeah like use<br>yeah re you know go back and<br>then yeah apply it and we'll like<br>understand the theory once you've seen<br>the concept in clinical um yeah i would<br>say put in a fair number of hours um<br>the assignments<br>i yeah<br>take time um especially if you're used<br>to a test-based sort of<br>undergraduate it does take a bit to sort<br>of adjust to<br>getting a lot of assignments out um but<br>you know<br>you get into the swing of it and<br>you learn what's expected and yeah<br>become more efficient at learning which<br>is what you'd hope as you go through the<br>program<br>yeah i want to like reiterate there are<br>a lot of assignments<br>and they're not necessarily like<br>you know<br>sometimes they were on like we'd have<br>like a two-week break and there happened<br>to be an assignment due<br>during our two-week break so it wasn't<br>you know we couldn't really treat it as<br>a full break or<br>um unless you're super organized and you<br>did it beforehand but you're not really<br>doing things beforehand because you<br>just handed an assignment so like<br>you know you just hand in one and then<br>you're getting ready for the next one<br>you hand that in and then you're getting<br>ready for the next one so it's quite<br>like<br>you know one after the other and there<br>are assignments due while we're on<br>placement as well because there are a<br>lot of assignments that are based on<br>their placements like case studies and<br>stuff so<br>thanks guys we've got a question here<br>when do you find out if you've been<br>accepted onto the course so we do really<br>like to try and be as timely as we can<br>so there's a number of um university<br>processes that students have to go<br>through and then there is an interview<br>that i have to undertake around<br>child to sort of sign people off as<br>being safe to work with children and<br>then there's a police vetting process so<br>there's a number of processes that have<br>to go through that students have to go<br>through in order to be eligible and<br>being signed off as being um<br>you know able to be a part of the<br>program but we do like to people let<br>people know as soon as we can so we try<br>and turn around applications as quickly<br>as we can a lot of it depends on when<br>students apply and then how quickly they<br>upload their documentation and stuff<br>like that but we do try and we will let<br>people know all the way through<br>applications are open at the moment so<br>people can apply now<br>and we close up until we sort of have<br>applications up until december so<br>students can be applying now even if<br>they haven't got their final results yet<br>from from their undergraduate degree<br>they can apply and we can offer<br>conditional offers depending on final<br>results so you can be given a place in<br>the program and it'll depend whether you<br>meet the gpa so that's something that<br>you may choose to do<br>now is when you've got a bit of time up<br>if you're interested upload your<br>documentation and make an application<br>now<br>uh the course begins in february<br>um and as i said applications close<br>around december january<br>um<br>and what are apricon selectively so<br>really we're looking at the academic um<br>aptitude for the program also there's<br>some other things that we're looking for<br>around is your desire to be a nurse<br>really would chris if you've got<br>anything else you'd like to add to that<br>uh no i mean there's the academic cutoff<br>at a five or a b but other than that you<br>know we've our classes are great with<br>the great mixture i think that um people<br>have that people bring to nursing and i<br>think that you know alana and laura<br>would attest to the fact that nursing is<br>an art and a science<br>uh so those that come with the science<br>learn the art and those that come with<br>the art they're in the science so it's<br>yeah works out well<br>um<br>what happens with classes and clinical<br>placement during changes in coping so<br>we've moved to an online format and it's<br>shelana and laura can probably talk to<br>that because they were on lockdown last<br>year with their course so<br>what we did was we delivered as much as<br>we could online and then chris moyer is<br>fantastic at organizing clinical<br>placements and working with a dhb and<br>she was one of the only ones actually<br>that managed to um get placed forth<br>completed to other institutions managed<br>to get clinical placements for our<br>students as soon as we sort of got out<br>so we ended up amalgamating our clinical<br>placements together and that was all up<br>to chris who did that and some students<br>who were in other programs didn't get<br>that opportunity so we're very lucky<br>that she's got a very strong<br>relationship with the clinical sector<br>that allows us to do that<br>i think this we were lucky last year the<br>students only missed one week yeah in<br>the end i think but this year that same<br>group of students now alan and laura for<br>example uh their cohort is going in you<br>know that we were just started their<br>nine-week placement and we were pulled<br>off<br>um at level four which was unfortunate<br>but<br>and last year at level four students<br>weren't allowed in but this year they<br>really want this group of students to<br>get through and get registered<br>so uh they've allowed them in our dhbs<br>that we're dealing with southern and<br>canterbury to go back and so they've<br>just gone back in this week<br>and<br>so carrying on with their nine week<br>placement which is great<br>yeah so and hopefully their group that<br>goes out in november december will be<br>fine<br>the clinical placements run concurrently<br>with academic papers so<br>so there are three full in the first<br>year there are three full-time year<br>papers that run throughout the whole<br>year and they're taught in study blocks<br>and then we have an and then in semester<br>one there's two papers a science paper<br>and a clinical paper and they still run<br>concurrently and the clinical clinical<br>hours are embedded in all the papers but<br>when you're out on clinical it's often<br>related more to whatever clinical paper<br>you're doing so they are they do run<br>concurrently with with the clinical<br>paper really<br>well but you're not going into they're<br>not coming into class run separately on<br>a timetable however in the blocks when<br>you're out in five week block you're out<br>on five week clinical so<br>having said that you'll be doing a case<br>study and perhaps a reflective practice<br>piece of work within that five weeks<br>that are related to the paper that<br>you're studying that will be marked and<br>as an assessment for say<br>the acute care place<br>paper or something you know<br>the two days of torture in christchurch<br>at this stage we haven't got any<br>opportunity to be teaching in dunedin at<br>this stage so that all the two days are<br>so there's not a lot as i said with the<br>exam component there's only really<br>science exams the rest of us there's<br>science tests and science exams but the<br>rest of the papers are internal<br>assessments like long essays or<br>so yes most of the assignments are<br>essays i would have said<br>case studies case studies<br>uh do you have exemptions or rpl for<br>research projects from previous studies<br>um no we don't we may you may get some<br>rpl for a research paper<br>but the research projects really have to<br>have a nursing focus so unless you have<br>done something with the nursing focus<br>then no they have to be a 30-point<br>research project that shows your<br>application of nursing to a primary<br>piece of research so<br>rpl with a research project is not<br>possible<br>no you can apply for as soon as you've<br>finished or even as i said before even<br>if you're in your final year of your<br>undergraduate degree you can apply for<br>this program<br>for example could you apply to start a<br>year after uh so yes and you can and so<br>sometimes people um yeah so we have<br>people who come from other um jobs so<br>they're not all just coming from<br>undergraduate degrees so we have a<br>number of um students who have been out<br>in the workforce so they may have been<br>away from their study for up to 10 years<br>before they've come back and done some<br>more study with us in this program so<br>there isn't definitely a time frame when<br>you have to apply after you've finished<br>your undergraduate degree that's up to<br>so as i said about the part-time option<br>that's that's really a conversation with<br>me because i need to understand exactly<br>what your other commitments are and what<br>type of part-time option you're looking<br>for so that's probably better to have a<br>um international students we have a<br>number of international students um<br>that and we've had now we do have to let<br>people know at this stage the issue with<br>being an international student is is not<br>not so much being in the program that's<br>fine the issue is when it comes to<br>getting employment post to post the<br>program<br>at this stage most students who graduate<br>from an undergraduate or<br>pre-registration degree i should say um<br>go through the this<br>national system to get a job called the<br>ace program and in order to apply for<br>the ace program<br>which is the national repository of<br>getting a job basically you have to be a<br>new zealand citizen or new zealand<br>resident<br>so that limits the job opportunities for<br>international students is a bit more<br>limited because of that that's not to<br>say that you can't still get a job post<br>the program it's just up to the<br>individual student might have do it or<br>canvassing themselves around different<br>but i think in the current job situation<br>they won't be having any problems no<br>that's right but we still just have to<br>let them know that at this stage they<br>and my permanent batches were attending<br>school while on placements no so when<br>you're in clinical you're just in<br>clinical for five week blocks<br>yes there is a possibility being set<br>yes so we so as i said about the reason<br>that we um<br>the reason that a number of we don't<br>appeal a number of the pace papers and<br>is because there is um<br>the notion of applying whatever you're<br>learning in that paper to the nursing<br>context so when we talk about anatomy<br>and physiology<br>there is that is a<br>a<br>broad subject but it also has clinical<br>hours embedded in that paper and you<br>also have to it's often applied to that<br>nursing context so<br>there would be a conversation with me to<br>have a look at the transcript but<br>generally speaking we aren't rpl in any<br>anatomy and physiology and the other<br>thing to remember of course unless<br>you've done it at postgraduate level and<br>doing anatomy and physiology at an<br>undergraduate level is at a bachelor's<br>level where you're doing the anatomy and<br>physiology at a master's level so<br>they're two different levels<br>so it would only be if you done studied<br>the anatomy and physiology at a master's<br>level<br>uh<br>we can't rpl practical clinical skills<br>and at all the nursing council as we<br>talked about before<br>um required you require students to<br>undertake the 1100 hours clinical skills<br>and sell in clinical practice themselves<br>so we can't in the program<br>did you answer how many students are<br>enrolled this year jenny sorry i missed<br>oh so no i didn't there's 33 this year<br>in this in the first year one year one<br>sorry yeah and 22 in there<br>does applying earlier than december give<br>you a better chance of being executive<br>no<br>we we um<br>there's no<br>we it's really up to how you want to be<br>planning for yourself if you want to<br>apply now that's fine but equaling<br>december if you want to wait for results<br>that's good as gold as well<br>did you answer the one really early on<br>jenny i i just probably<br>sorry i might not heard um i'm currently<br>studying health student<br>part-time will the fact that i'm<br>studying part-time affect my eligibility<br>yeah i just said that would still be<br>able to look at the transcript and and<br>look at the number of papers over to<br>full-time equivalent right okay yeah<br>sorry yeah right is there any other<br>questions i think we've managed to<br>answer most of them going through there<br>how many people generally applied does<br>that is that<br>oh no<br>um<br>each year it's growing we would have to<br>say so yeah when we first started there<br>was um about i think about eight or nine<br>applied and only five four ended up<br>getting through really<br>at the end because we had a few people<br>withdrawals so in each year we've got<br>more and more numbers so um i think last<br>year we had you know quite a few that<br>applied more than 33 that actually<br>came into the program so it depends on<br>okay i think that's um<br>almost at the end of our<br>um<br>on the chat<br>all right<br>sorry that's billy telling<br>okay well i'd like to thank everybody<br>for coming along and um if people have<br>any further questions particularly<br>around more detail say like they'd like<br>to see a copy of timetable things like<br>that<br>um could you please you can email<br>nursing<br>dot science otago.ac.nz<br>that's if you want really really<br>particular details around and or you<br>want to make an appointment with me to<br>talk to me about part-time options or<br>things like that<br>i'd like to really thank alana and laura<br>for coming along and talking to for us<br>today it's been really good to have your<br>perspective and i'm
