Mark has had a stellar academic career in  <br>the United States, and is currently Professor of <br>Architecture and Dean Emeritus at the Graduate  <br>School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation <br>at Columbia University in New York. He is  <br>an historian, theorist and critic, who explores <br>the intersection of architecture, art, philosophy,  <br>culture and technology. He has been prolific as an <br>author, editor and exhibition curator with books  <br>and exhibitions among the most celebrated <br>the world has seen in the last 35 years.<br>In this session, we’re going to <br>take a walk through Mark’s career,  <br>pausing at some of the highlights along the way.<br>A very warm welcome to you, Mark. <br>Congratulations on your incredible career,  <br>and thank you so much for joining us tonight.<br>You’re welcome.<br>You’re in Spain at the <br>moment. What takes you there  <br>and are you there for a short time or a long time?<br>I think anytime in Spain is a short time, <br>so I try to make it as long as possible.  <br>I’m here a lot because my partner <br>Beatriz, her family is from this  <br>region and this place, so we have a place here <br>on the water. It’s just obsessively wonderful.  <br>It’s basically a beach, so it’s my New <br>Zealand thing in the Mediterranean.<br>Perfect, sounds—<br>It’s borderline criminal, so I really shouldn’t <br>tell you more about it. It’s ridiculously good.<br>All the better from Auckland where <br>we’ve just had a big storm last night.  <br>I understand you grew up in Palmerston North. <br>I’m interested to know what influenced your  <br>decision to study architecture, and if you <br>recall any particular formative experiences?<br>Actually, I was hoping you could tell me. I have <br>no idea. Since the age of nine, I would answer the  <br>question, “What are you going to do?”, I would <br>say, “I’m going to be an architect,” and it’s  <br>probably, you know, I’m very stubborn, so maybe <br>that’s just what happened. It was a sort of an  <br>error and I just kept repeating it in my stubborn <br>way. There’s no explanation. I was not brilliant  <br>at building with blocks, and there wasn’t, as far <br>as I know, any architecture in Palmerston North,  <br>as defined, like as high art. Of course, there <br>was architecture in every sense, everywhere.  <br>My only guess is that my <br>parents were great travellers  <br>and always would show these wonderful slides of <br>everywhere they had been. I remember very vividly  <br>a lot of the mosques in Isfahan and so on. <br>I have a little bit of a feeling that maybe,  <br>but this is just sort of romantic <br>fantasy, that maybe I looked at the  <br>real thing and then thought I should somehow <br>participate, but I think the truth is probably  <br>more kind-of crazy, like it’s just <br>a mistake. But mistakes are good.<br>And you completed your BArch here at the <br>University of Auckland from 1975 to 1979,  <br>when different staff in the School were running <br>the three sub-schools of Brick, Timber and Steel.  <br>In our School centenary book, we categorised the <br>1970s as “the loose years”, so I’m interested to  <br>know what your take on the School was back then, <br>if it was loose, and if that was good for you?<br>Yes, and yes. It definitely was loose,  <br>but loose with a kind-of purpose, I would <br>say, because I think what was brilliant in  <br>that moment was the uncertainty, because there <br>were the three different sort of mini-schools,  <br>and the new building was on its way, towards <br>the end of my time there. So, you felt like  <br>you were at the end of an experimental period, <br>which was about to be followed by formality,  <br>as represented by this big glossy building. So all <br>this sort of anti-architecture, all these sheds,  <br>connected to the great tradition of the <br>shed and the mythology of the School,  <br>was about to give way to what, relative to <br>that, was not a very interesting building,  <br>a new building. It was like the <br>last years. And in that moment,  <br>it seemed to me not even ideologically <br>strict. For example, as students,  <br>we could move around between these schools. They <br>were not like religions that you had to follow.<br>For whatever reason, I think I started off over in <br>Steel or something and ended up towards the more  <br>experimental end [Brick], because I was attracted <br>to the vertical teaching, the fact that the  <br>younger students and the older students were side <br>by side. More than that, the teachers were also  <br>acting more like children than adults. So, I think <br>it was a great time in which the School didn’t  <br>know what it was, and it seems to me, it’s always <br>great when people don’t know what they’re doing.  <br>“Loose” implies you do know what you’re doing, you <br>could do, and you’re not doing it. I think it was  <br>more uncertain than that, and really fantastic and <br>even the fact that the Timber [Studio] Building  <br>burnt down somehow conveyed this last dance <br>feeling. Dancing, I think it really was. I  <br>remember [lecturer] Dave Mitchell really danced <br>amazingly well. He was quite a large guy,  <br>but somehow when dancing, he seemed to be doing <br>some sort of Olympic routine down on the floor.  <br>This was very inspiring for students, that the <br>teachers were, to use an old word, very cool.  <br>As a result, I think there was a great <br>camaraderie. I saw you published that  <br>picture where all of us are gathered on the edge <br>of the new building. It was very emotional for  <br>me to see it and to see myself there and to <br>realise how many people were in that picture  <br>who were such wonderful companions at that time.<br>The actual Experimental Building that had multiple <br>floors and multiple staircases and platforms,  <br>was that the particular scene of the dancing?<br>Yeah, of course, because it was the only <br>way you could move around in the building,  <br>it insisted on that. I suppose it was a bit <br>like every child’s fantasy, like a playhouse,  <br>where it’s irregular, and all the <br>levels. In a way, it really captured, to  <br>use your word, the loosening <br>of the screws and so on.  <br>I think it was wonderful. Of course, I suppose, <br>and you’re the expert on this, but I think  <br>somehow all the experiments of the 60s <br>were nesting there at the end of the 70s,  <br>so it was last dance, not just for the <br>School, but also for the discipline.<br>The other thing is that I thought at the time, <br>and I think more now, that there were so many  <br>wonderful teachers. Really that’s what made the <br>School. It doesn’t really matter what the building  <br>was and all that. There were amazing teachers. <br>They might’ve even liked each other quite a lot.  <br>Not totally, but quite a lot, and <br>that’s impressive for a School.<br>It does sound like a great <br>time to have been there.<br>Yeah, one more thing, there was also a <br>generational thing. Doc Toy was still a  <br>kind-of cosmic guru, implying that somehow <br>whatever you did, even in New Zealand – and  <br>“even in New Zealand” was the way of thinking of <br>it – even in New Zealand, one could connect to the  <br>great traditions, not just of architecture, but <br>of culture. I think John Dixon continued that,  <br>and then Mike Austin, Dave Mitchell, Nick Stanish <br>and John Goldwater. All of these teachers were  <br>somehow your intermediaries between the local <br>situation and this deep history. My strongest  <br>memory of that time is how kind and open and, to <br>use your word again, loose, the teachers were. It  <br>was actually a wonderful time. By the way, this <br>is all sounding very romantic, and therefore not  <br>to be trusted. As Mike Austin would tell you, <br>all I ever did was complain when I was there.<br>Oh no, you were one of those students [laughing]!<br>Oh yeah, and he said to me once, “You complain <br>a lot, but there’ll be a time that you look  <br>back and say these were your golden years”, <br>in the sense that you had time to complain,  <br>and time to think, and time to <br>reflect. This is one of the many  <br>things that Mike told me, that I carried with me <br>and actually try to pass on to my own students.<br>Well, I believe that Mike is with us in the <br>audience this evening, so we might get a comment.<br>One of the victims of this conversation  <br>[laughing]. I owe everything to Mike because he <br>had this generosity to what hadn’t happened yet.  <br>He would trust somebody, if he just let <br>them do what they wanted to do, to go  <br>to a place that hadn’t been defined yet. <br>That seems to be the essence of teaching.  <br>So I owe everything to Mike, in the sense that <br>he really was my advisor. Some people do PhDs  <br>and advisors don’t really advise. He really <br>was the advisor, like a counsellor in a way.<br>That’s a good time to move to this document.<br>Oh that thing, okay, but just to say that <br>teaching is the thing that matters the most.  <br>Oh this, so it exists.<br>This is your BArch thesis titled, “A Case <br>for Chance”, supervised by Mike Austin. It  <br>is about “the random interactions of independent <br>phenomena”. What really struck me in looking at it  <br>was the extent to which it signals all of your <br>subsequent interests in architecture, art,  <br>philosophy, culture, and technology. They’re all <br>in there. There’s even a poem called “The Legend  <br>of the White Wall”, suggesting a fascination with <br>white walls long before your book, White Walls,  <br>Designer Dresses. I’m wondering if you remember <br>this document in particular, and if it was an  <br>important piece of work for you at the time? <br>It has beautiful photos right through, too.<br>Well, firstly, Julia, I didn’t know it <br>still existed. I haven’t seen it since  <br>the day I submitted it, and that’s <br>the only copy that you’re holding.<br>They should never have let me take <br>it out of the library, but they did.<br>Yeah, but I really had thought <br>that it didn’t exist anymore,  <br>and I’ve often wondered. I’ve often wanted to <br>see it, like trying to look at yourself as a baby  <br>and the fruitless effort to see if <br>you could see yourself in formation.  <br>My feeling is, of course, for me, I know <br>that this is an important document, because  <br>it’s where at the end of it, Mike <br>said to me, “You’re good at that”,  <br>the writing/thinking sort of stuff. So really, <br>it was the beginning of this trajectory into  <br>scholarship, but it’s also, you have to <br>think, it’s not just Mike, but the School,  <br>because there was this amazing thing that at the <br>end of your training as a professional architect,  <br>you had to write something for three months. It <br>is faithful to the old idea that the architect  <br>is an intellectual, that every professional is a <br>thinker. In that moment, I went down that path.<br>Whether the content of it relates to my <br>current work, it would be better for you  <br>to say than me. It’s funny that you’ve spotted <br>the white wall obsession is already there, but  <br>for me, it was more like a coming <br>of age, or self-discovery, whatever.  <br>The photographs were exactly that, just <br>photographs I was taking. I’ve often wanted  <br>to see that document, so I’m really almost <br>shocked that you’re holding it in your hand.<br>We can probably organise a scan for you.<br>But do you know, it gets back to this. The trouble <br>is as a theorist, you just pounce on everything,  <br>everything is grist for the mill. So <br>the chance that the whole thing was,  <br>of course, exactly about what I was saying <br>before, not knowing what you’re doing,  <br>and mistakes are very, very crucial. That whole <br>sub-thesis was about the history of that idea,  <br>that being a little bit out of control, <br>not knowing, is the beginning of knowing.<br>By the way, why would you want to know anything <br>if you hadn’t had the sense of not knowing first?  <br>Doubt is like an engine. An engine of thinking, it <br>might be an engine of relationships. I don’t want  <br>to sound too “fortune cookie”, but it’s really <br>like that, to the extent that you don’t know,  <br>you learn, or you grow and so on. Now, I’ve turned <br>it into a speech. Architecture is traditionally  <br>considered to be the opposite. It’s the opposite <br>of doubt. Actually, we build to cover up doubt.  <br>You could almost say that cities rise up and <br>are their strongest and most permanent where  <br>our doubts are the biggest, so how do you take a <br>field like architecture, which is making symbols  <br>of certainty, but for those symbols to be in <br>any way interesting, there needs to be doubt.  <br>Teaching, school, and studio, and the inside of <br>the architect’s brain, and the inside of a school,  <br>are kind-of laboratories of doubt. That’s why <br>those years were very productive, it seems to me  <br>in the School, because it was uncertain. There was <br>doubt there, and good teachers nurture the doubt.<br>It’s a trick, because architects are then called <br>on to go in public and pretend that they know  <br>what they’re doing and know what buildings <br>represent, so there’s this very boring role,  <br>very conservative role, that <br>buildings play in society,  <br>but they’re generated by very crazy <br>people who think that buildings can talk.  <br>Only architects think that buildings talk, so <br>this is what’s wonderful of a school. It’s like a  <br>room of children who think they can talk to <br>buildings, and we fruitlessly try to tell the  <br>rest of society that that’s really happening, and <br>with not much success. For thousands of years.  <br>End of speech. That was just trying to go <br>directly to the question of doubt, and chance.<br>They let me take your PhD out of the library <br>too. Completed in 1986, entitled “Jacques  <br>Derrida and Architecture: The Deconstructive <br>Possibilities of Architectural Discourse”,  <br>again supervised by Mike Austin. The urban <br>myth in Auckland is that early on in your  <br>enrolment, you went to New York and <br>knocked on Peter Eisenman’s door,  <br>and that he really encouraged your focus <br>on deconstruction. I’m just wondering if  <br>there’s any truth in this, or if it’s a <br>myth that has spiralled out of control.<br>No, it’s not true. No. But probably <br>like most myths, there’s truth in it,  <br>but it’s not true. More or <br>less, the way I remember it,  <br>but why would you trust my memory? You know <br>I used to watch Coronation Street, and Ena  <br>Sharples once was having a beer or a stout or <br>whatever she had with Minnie Caldwell, and she  <br>says, “I don’t like to go down memory lane because <br>the last time I went down there, I got mugged.”<br>So, if we try to remember this moment, what <br>happened was, in what was for me a very  <br>interesting journey, I ended up writing about <br>deconstruction and always imagining that this was  <br>basically a philosophical position of the late <br>1960s, so basically feeling there in New Zealand,  <br>more or less happy, whatever, trying <br>to think through the implications of  <br>a philosophical movement of the late 60s, not <br>thinking that that had any relevance to anyone,  <br>anytime. Then, an architect called Stanley <br>Tigerman came to visit New Zealand on some kind of  <br>scam, selling formica, and there were <br>allusions to deconstruction in his  <br>lectures. For the first time, it occurred <br>to me this was not just a personal fantasy,  <br>many decades later, but actually there <br>were people who were interested in it.  <br>That started a desire to go over to <br>see who was interested in this stuff.<br>When I went to New York, I did meet Peter <br>Eisenman, but it was the other way around.  <br>He was interested in what I was doing with <br>deconstruction. But there was great pleasure  <br>to discover that suddenly there was a community of <br>people for whom this subject was not historical,  <br>but urgently relevant. I found all those <br>conversations extraordinarily exciting,  <br>so exciting, and I think that Mike sensed this, <br>I could easily just have stayed in New York. He  <br>actually sent me a message saying something along <br>the lines, “If you don’t come back and finish your  <br>PhD, we’re going to …” and the word I remember <br>is “terminate you”, which is a very un-Mike term.<br>I took that to be really a serious message, like  <br>you need to finish this PhD. This again <br>was a great gift to me, because I came back  <br>and did finish it and then returned to New York to <br>continue those conversations. So, it’s a myth, but  <br>Eisenman, who became one of the assessors or the <br>readers of the thesis, was an important reference  <br>point, because also of course, in his orbit were <br>other people interested in the subject and so on.<br>Now, why do people want the myth to be that myth, <br>because the myth would be once again, that somehow  <br>a New Zealander would need an American to <br>guide them towards a French philosopher?<br>It would look that way, yes.<br>There’s a classic New Zealand thing. <br>I love the classic New Zealand  <br>thing. I’m the perfect example of that: we are <br>not worthy, we are so distant from the world,  <br>we’re genuinely modest, which is <br>immediately followed by the opposite,  <br>which is an extraordinary arrogance, because since <br>we are so distant from the world, we’re pure,  <br>direct. If I’m reading Derrida, I’m getting it <br>right for the first time, because I haven’t been  <br>corrupted by all this other stuff going on. <br>So, there’s simultaneous genuine modesty,  <br>combined with this extraordinary arrogance, <br>in equal mixture, that’s the thing,  <br>and I think that myth is about the first <br>part, which is the New Zealander feeling  <br>like there’s got to be this other voice. That <br>was interesting. You arrive in New York and they  <br>have the opposite point of view, which is like, <br>“Hey, what have you got to say?” It was great.<br>When you decided to move to the States, was <br>that a risk in terms of being able to work  <br>or did you already have the job at Princeton <br>lined up? Were you imagining staying awhile?<br>No. No, I never thought anything would happen. <br>That PhD was done as part of a first wave of  <br>PhDs taught by Mike, who had himself <br>a PhD. Maybe Mike was the first.<br>He wasn’t the first, but he <br>was one of the earlier ones. <br>Right, so let’s say the first generation to be <br>taught by others who had done a PhD. The idea that  <br>this would be a career is ridiculous. It was the <br>exact opposite. I can’t say it strongly enough,  <br>but it’s really hard to do a PhD when you <br>think that this is the basis of a career,  <br>because then everything you write is aimed towards <br>a hypothetical audience that will love you,  <br>and then give you a job, but the problem <br>is, PhDs are about changing the field.  <br>You’re actually writing for an <br>audience that doesn’t exist yet.  <br>So I think again I was very lucky to be writing in <br>a time in which it was a very stupid thing to do  <br>a PhD. And therefore you could really follow your <br>instincts and try to do a good job and all that.<br>So, when I went to New York, it was just because <br>I wanted to keep going with those conversations.  <br>I was appalled when Princeton gave me a job, <br>and I was so sure that they would recognise  <br>their mistake, that during the first year <br>there, I insulted everybody all the time,  <br>because I thought, this is it, I’ve got one year, <br>or to say it another way around, I just was honest  <br>or direct. Of course, it <br>turned out they loved that,  <br>so I stayed and all my <br>diplomatic colleagues were fired.<br>Did they give you a one-year contract <br>to start with, and then it grew?<br>Yeah, every year it was one year and one <br>year, and then it got a little bit bigger.  <br>Then before, you know it, I had gone from <br>the outside of that institution to the very  <br>inside of it and so much so that I was no <br>longer the rebel, so I ran away to Columbia,  <br>where again I was on the outside, but very <br>quickly found itself on the inside there as well.<br>When I said before I was being honest, I probably <br>just had a bad character. I was very undiplomatic,  <br>let’s say, and again, it’s really hard these days <br>to be undiplomatic. Everybody’s so risk averse.<br>So far in this conversation, Julia, there’s a <br>lot of luck here. There’s a lot of lucky breaks.<br>Luck and good timing.<br>Yeah, but you know …<br>That’s probably a good time to move on to working <br>with Philip Johnson. You were co-curating the 1988  <br>exhibition, Deconstructivist Architecture, <br>at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,  <br>with the book of the same name, published <br>at the same time. How did the project and  <br>collaboration come about? What was <br>it like working with Philip Johnson?<br>This is a long story, but the short version <br>is it’s going to be exactly what I just said  <br>before. The reason I ended up curating that <br>show is because I was invited to a dinner,  <br>where there were a few young <br>scholars and a number of architects –  <br>Eisenman, Gehry and a few others. The dinner had <br>been called by Philip Johnson, and during the  <br>dinner, they explained a concept for an exhibition <br>they were going to do. I thought it was a shitty,  <br>stupid exhibition, and I said so, just because <br>that was my mode at that time. This is quite  <br>soon after, a few months after, I had left [New <br>Zealand]. I had just started the job at Princeton.  <br>And I said it was a very stupid exhibition.<br>Then, Johnson said something like, “Well, <br>what would you do if it was you?” I said,  <br>“I would make an exhibition that proved that Frank <br>Gehry is finished.” They all looked aback. I mean,  <br>I really was thinking, I said, “Because that’s the <br>purpose of an exhibition, to celebrate the work of  <br>the last 10 years, let’s say, to create space for <br>new work.” Gehry, whose work I greatly admired,  <br>I thought he had done some amazing work <br>in the previous ten years. My argument was  <br>you get to MoMA and you celebrate work when <br>it’s finished. Like it’s a high cathedral.<br>Gehry came up to me afterwards and said, “I really <br>liked what you said. You put a gun to my head,  <br>but you’re wrong, and I’ll show you.” I didn’t <br>know he was working on Bilbao at that moment.  <br>He’s a street fighter. So as a result, I just <br>found myself there, so then they said, “Okay,  <br>you’re going to do it.” So, I did it, and at <br>the same time I was starting to teach, there was  <br>my first exhibition and first <br>real teaching job, although I had  <br>been teaching at the school in Auckland, <br>which was a great privilege as a PhD student.<br>Again, we didn’t say it before, but there <br>was such a kindness. As PhD students,  <br>we basically had lunch and coffee and so on with <br>the faculty. This is a continuation of that thing  <br>of the experimental school, the young and the old. <br>That was where I was doing all the complaining,  <br>sitting there permanently, the whole <br>day, complaining. Basically, I just  <br>went with that, into that <br>situation and started to curate.<br>And, what was it like to work with Johnson? <br>Amazing, because Johnson was old at that time,  <br>but still fast. I mean, he walked <br>faster than anyone and talked faster.  <br>Basically, people at the museum hated him, because <br>he, of course, had invented that department.  <br>He was thoroughly unimpressed with what they had <br>been doing, and the whole point of this exhibition  <br>was to rattle the cage. They hated the <br>exhibition. They hated the thought that it  <br>was happening. Therefore, they hated me, because <br>I represented Johnson. It’s like the revenge.  <br>He’s supposed to not be there. So they tried <br>to block everything. The way it worked is  <br>Johnson allowed me to make every <br>decision, every single thing,  <br>and he acted as the cover and defended <br>me against all the institutional forces.<br>I have to say it was exhilarating, because at <br>MoMA, they know the politics of typefaces. I  <br>got into arguing. I remember a couple of days <br>before the exhibition opened, a man came to me  <br>and he said he was in charge of etiquette at <br>the museum. He was incredibly well-dressed,  <br>like something out of a movie. I was just <br>marvelling at the fact that there was such a  <br>person. He said, “Which colour flowers <br>do you want during the opening,  <br>red or blue?” It couldn’t be red because that <br>would be a clumsy reference to the Russians,  <br>and it couldn’t be blue because that would be the <br>counter, so I said, “Could we have both?” He said,  <br>“It’s never happened before. Let me go and <br>check.” He disappeared. He came back the following  <br>day, and said, “Your wish has been granted.” It <br>was like this. It was super exhilarating. Johnson  <br>somehow knew that what I was doing was rocking <br>the boat, so he supported it all the way.  <br>I have to say it was a very great <br>privilege and very, very interesting.<br>After the exhibition opened, very shortly <br>afterwards, it started to surface, Johnson’s  <br>intimate links with fascism and <br>anti-Semitic writings and all of this.  <br>I just broke. I couldn’t, you know. So <br>I don’t regret working with him, but I’m  <br>totally supportive of the removal of the name and <br>disconnection of things that are unforgivable,  <br>but it came just after it. <br>Now, if it had happened during.  <br>What kind of opportunist am I? That’s when <br>I would have learnt. If I had learnt this  <br>during, I wonder sometimes. I don’t <br>trust myself to have just walked out.  <br>I probably would’ve acted out. I would’ve stayed <br>there and made this part of the story, but  <br>you gotta understand how innocent, and again, <br>innocence was incredibly useful in that moment.<br>You kept working further with deconstruction, <br>reworking your PhD for publication as  <br>Derrida’s Haunt in 1993, and the introduction <br>acknowledges that a lot had happened in the  <br>field of deconstruction between 1986 and <br>1993, including Derrida writing about  <br>architecture and collaborating with <br>Tschumi on the Parc de le Villette.  <br>Your own position had also changed from periphery <br>to centre, and you’d obviously made friends with  <br>at least several of the key players. So, what <br>impact did those things have, do you think,  <br>on the development of the PhD to the book? Your <br>move from periphery to centre in particular.<br>Yeah, it’s funny listening to you, <br>you know me better than I know myself.  <br>A couple of things come to my mind here. I mean,  <br>the exhibition itself insists that that <br>work is not derivative of deconstruction or  <br>a demonstration of it. The argument is that <br>if you were interested in deconstruction,  <br>this is the aspect of architecture that would <br>attract you. The idea was that a small set of  <br>architects were triggering certain doubts <br>around the status of geometry and so on.  <br>Yes, there are occasional direct links, like <br>Derrida working with Tschumi and things like this,  <br>but they’re not, let’s say, at all what <br>interests me, although what Derrida writes  <br>about Tschumi in that collaboration is extremely <br>interesting, in the history of Derrida’s work.<br>The PhD is the opposite. The PhD was interested <br>in the architecture that’s inside deconstruction  <br>already, like what are the ideas about <br>architecture on which deconstruction depends,  <br>even in the word deconstruction? It’s the <br>kind of inverse. One is the architecture  <br>inside deconstruction, and then you were asking <br>what happened when deconstruction went inside  <br>architecture? Probably, I turned the PhD into <br>a book to, as it were, re-assert that previous  <br>attitude that I had, but actually it’s not <br>a shift of position. They are complementary.  <br>I insisted at the time that deconstruction would <br>not be productive of some kind of style. People  <br>were very skeptical of that, because the museum <br>is like a machine for style. I was, I guess,  <br>proven right relatively quickly, and the status <br>of that exhibition changed relatively quickly.<br>Now, I’m almost embarrassed about <br>how much honour is shown to that  <br>exhibition. In retrospect, I realised it was <br>very, very focused, very polemical. I mean,  <br>all of those architects that were in there, of <br>course, went on to become unbelievably important.  <br>I don’t, in any way, think the show contributed <br>to that. I think it’s the other way around. These  <br>were already very, very bright [people]. Think of <br>Zaha Hadid. Really just one of the most amazing  <br>architects of our time. She didn’t need an <br>exhibition at MoMA to be who she was and would  <br>become, but nevertheless that happened. Notice <br>how all those directions were entirely different  <br>… Rem Koolhaas. Most of those people had not <br>built anything at that time. They went on to build  <br>almost everything, but there’s no debt there to <br>the exhibition. At the time, they all were very  <br>aware of the fact that I was using their work to <br>make a theoretical point. They were all happy to  <br>be celebrated at MoMA. Why not? But there was not <br>a tie, so I’m saying all this, because actually  <br>when I turned the PhD into a book, I didn’t have <br>to fight for anything. In a way, the show had  <br>become almost embarrassingly respected. Turning <br>the PhD into a book was a nightmare. It was like  <br>root canal work. If you leave a book alone, as you <br>probably know, for three years or whatever it was,  <br>you’re a different person. The first thing you <br>have to deal with is someone else wrote it,  <br>and then when you write a book, you write <br>a book to find out who you are. Imagine  <br>trying to find out who you are by rewriting <br>a book by someone else, which is a previous  <br>you. There you are, somehow caught between the <br>old you and the new you. Nevertheless, I did it.  <br>Somehow it seems to mark that inquiry. Really, <br>again, the book seems to have lasted in the  <br>sense of it still seems to trigger a certain <br>attitude and hopefully a seriousness about  <br>the right of architects to think philosophically. <br>This was at the heart of that mission.<br>Could an architect do this? I was only, only <br>a New Zealander, only, only an architect,  <br>only, only young, all these things. Do you have <br>the right to write about the most extraordinary  <br>French philosopher? My point would be, yes, <br>you have that right, and the kindness that  <br>Jacques Derrida himself showed <br>to me and to that work was  <br>incredibly embarrassing. I found actually when <br>I was with him, he was always incredibly kind,  <br>but I couldn’t speak. I could literally not <br>speak because I was almost offended by how  <br>kind he was towards the work and then curious <br>about it and so on. Again, he was a teacher.<br>That’s fantastic.<br>A very long answer to your <br>question, but boy, it was hard.<br>It does help to explain a little bit why the <br>next book, White Walls, Designer Dresses, was so  <br>different, with the focus on modernism <br>and challenging the original claims of  <br>the protagonists from the ’20s about their <br>architecture being a lack of style, given that  <br>architecture is always aesthetic. It draws <br>out a question about the relationship between  <br>theory and history. I know that you’ve written <br>about this separately. I’d like to invite you  <br>to say a little bit about the relationship <br>between history and theory, as you see it.<br>It’s a bit of a risk for you to ask me that. Let <br>me try it this way. I teach one class every year.  <br>I taught it for thirteen years at Princeton, <br>and I’ve been in a long time now at Columbia,  <br>but every year, I teach a class <br>called the History of Theory.  <br>By the way, it’s always the same class and <br>it has the same syllabus. It hasn’t changed,  <br>which is a crime, I’m sure, but it’s a conceptual <br>experiment. Could you have the same syllabus  <br>for decades? Of course, I think every time it’s <br>different, because you connect the ideas to the  <br>world differently, but it’s really about <br>how history and theory are inseparable,  <br>that every architect is a theorist, <br>like I said before, but that also means  <br>a kind of historian, historia, telling a story. <br>So, yeah, in that moment, it was very deliberate.<br>Also, I was obsessed. Of course, if you look <br>in the Deconstructivist Architecture show,  <br>in the PhD and in the book that came out of it, <br>at the centre is a kind of obsession with the  <br>relationship between structure and ornament, <br>that which is supposedly necessary and that  <br>which is supposedly not necessary. Yet, somehow <br>it seems necessary to have the non-necessary  <br>thing around. That’s the obsession. It’s the <br>only thing I’m interested in, probably ever.<br>So, there’s this book, which seems, as you <br>point out, much more historical. It’s about  <br>the same thing. It’s about the relationship <br>between the surface and the structure – fabric,  <br>dress, the clothing, that which you don’t need, <br>but of course you do need. They’re linked.<br>I think it was also, and to this day, very <br>influenced by Beatriz Colomina, my partner, who as  <br>she always does, produces a kind of exhilarating <br>sense of history, like history becomes  <br>an unfolding. Again, this is another part of the <br>luck, the luck to be with Beatriz, the luck to be  <br>with Gill Mathewson when I was in New Zealand, who <br>was doing her pioneering work on gender in both  <br>practice and in theory. Again, look at Gill. It <br>was practise and theory together. So I think you  <br>learn a lot, if you’re lucky, if you’re lucky to <br>be with super interesting people, you learn a lot.<br>I think you can see in that <br>book on white walls, that  <br>Beatriz’s expertise on Le Corbusier has infected <br>me. Basically you’re part of a conversation,  <br>which is the conversation at home, in <br>the streets, in the school and so on.<br>In the end, I don’t know if I like the book.  <br>Maybe I don’t like any of them, but  <br>it’s interesting that it’s artists who <br>are the strongest readers of the book.  <br>There’s not a month goes by when I don’t get <br>calls from artists and so on. That’s, again,  <br>another thing very interesting. I said before, <br>do architects have the right to speak? Then,  <br>there’s another question. Who’s listening? <br>Listening seems to me such an under-estimated  <br>part of life and getting back to Mike. He was <br>a great listener. Listening, this is something.  <br>Who’s listening to us? I think when artists <br>are listening, you know you’re not so stupid.  <br>So I think it’s a stupid book. For me, <br>personally, I think it’s clumsy. The issues  <br>are important and probably that’s why the book’s <br>a bit clumsy. It really mattered a lot to me.<br>You can see that all the <br>other books are the same book  <br>in different forms. Even the more recent work on <br>radio and so on, it’s the same. You’re not going  <br>to get a new idea from me. You’re going to get the <br>same half idea that I had in Auckland, that same  <br>half idea. It’s amazing. You can take a half an <br>idea and maybe it’s like a graft or something. You  <br>can grow half an idea for the rest of your life. <br>If you have a whole idea, probably it’s all over.<br>We’ll take you to your ideas about <br>artists a little bit more now,  <br>asking about your work from the late ’90s and the <br>early 2000s, the focus on Constant’s New Babylon,  <br>with exhibitions and publications <br>exploring an artist’s visions for a city,  <br>for a post-revolutionary society. Then, <br>in the last ten years, you’ve done books  <br>and exhibitions on Gordon Matta-Clark, known <br>for cutting buildings open. What is it about  <br>artists who work with architectural <br>subject matter that interests you most?<br>I think the question would be, what’s an <br>architect and what’s an artist? By the way,  <br>Gordon Matta-Clark’s definition <br>was that art doesn’t have plumbing.  <br>Of course, it’s not necessarily completely true, <br>but I think of architects as people for whom  <br>buildings are questions. Society thinks that <br>buildings are answers, but for architects,  <br>a building is a question. In the same way that a <br>painter, a painter is somebody who doesn’t know  <br>what painting is. They paint their whole lives <br>to try to understand why they love this thing,  <br>painting. The greatest painters are the <br>ones for whom painting is their biggest  <br>question. For architects, we think buildings <br>are questions. We’re mystified by them and  <br>we find them enthralling. We’d <br>talk forever about buildings.<br>You do a conference on doorknobs, architects would <br>go for a week, but people who make doorknobs,  <br>won’t go to a conference on door <br>knobs. They make the door knob,  <br>and go home and have a life. Architects <br>don’t have a life – never have a life.  <br>We cannot stop talking. So for <br>us, buildings are questions.<br>Then, for artists, an architect is supposed to <br>be a figure of certainty, when it’s actually  <br>somebody who is doubtful about what a building <br>is. Artists, who are professional doubters,  <br>who ask us to change our ideas about what things <br>are, when they get interested in architecture,  <br>you get a doubling of that. Somebody who’s <br>curious about everything becomes curious about  <br>architecture, itself as a form of curiosity.<br>Matta-Clark was trained as an architect <br>first, and then his work is so provocative  <br>that everybody calls him an artist. My view <br>is he’s just an architect who’s not boring.  <br>He just lets the doubt that <br>is at the centre of our field  <br>become the work itself, whereas the rest <br>of architects tend to then seal the doubt.<br>That also plays into the whole gender argument, <br>because architects pretend to know what they’re  <br>doing, so they assume this masculine, this <br>man, explaining ideas about architecture,  <br>and the architecture which is radically uncertain, <br>produced by complex collaborations of people,  <br>clients, and situations and so on, but then <br>somehow we act as if a single figure, and  <br>preferably a male figure, could represent the <br>certainty of this thing that’s so doubtful.<br>Constant, on the other hand, was a <br>painter who pretended to be an architect,  <br>as a criticism of painting. I guess I’m super <br>interested in figures who cross those lines  <br>and then really research those lines. <br>Matta-Clark’s career was only ten years,  <br>as one of the most important architect/artists of <br>the twentieth century, but it’s really ten years  <br>of work. The New Babylon project of Constant <br>is also about ten years, so it’s amazing what  <br>you can do in ten years. Imagine you work for ten <br>years on one architectural project, and the last  <br>five years of that work is criticising your own <br>project. Who could not be interested in Constant?<br>I just got lucky. A friend, running a museum <br>in Rotterdam, had an instinct that I would be  <br>interested in Constant, knew that I was lecturing <br>about it and asked me to do an exhibition.  <br>Exhibitions are the single most exciting <br>thing in the history of the universe,  <br>because they’re so multi-dimensional.  <br>You’re communicating your obsessions, but also you <br>have to tune into the obsessions of the visitor.  <br>It’s just very, very exciting, so I love, <br>more than anything else, to do exhibitions.<br>So if you’re going to make an exhibition, and <br>there are millions of exhibitions all the time,  <br>wouldn’t you want to make an <br>exhibition about people who  <br>are changing the rules? I’m interested <br>always in those figures that do that.<br>When you’ve done a book <br>and an exhibition together,  <br>what do you like to do with the exhibition to <br>make sure that it’s different from the book,  <br>but bigger, in terms of the images being <br>bigger, and how can the exhibition be different?<br>Well, it’s horrible to go to an exhibition which <br>is a book on the wall. Actually almost any text  <br>on the wall is horrible. Wall texts are the worst, <br>most infantilising thing. Normally, it’s better to  <br>treat them as separate projects. So for example, <br>when Beatriz and I curated the Biennale in  <br>Istanbul, we deliberately made a separate book, <br>the Are We Human? book, which has nothing to do  <br>with the exhibition, but has to do with the <br>ideas that were in our heads while we were  <br>making the exhibition. There’s another book, which <br>is the catalogue, so always, you do it like that.<br>With the most recent one, the <br>Matta-Clark show in Shanghai,  <br>there was an enormous book that, to my knowledge,  <br>nobody has seen because the show opened during <br>the pandemic, which means it didn’t really open.  <br>The exhibition itself was a timeline, so when <br>you entered the exhibition, you were actually  <br>inside a 3D timeline. It was like being in a <br>swimming pool, with dotted lines of the lanes  <br>were the years. In that sense, there was <br>a little bit more relationship between the  <br>chronology of the book and the chronology of <br>the exhibition, but they are different things.<br>So, it’s a long answer to <br>your question, but I think  <br>the worst crime of an exhibition is to produce <br>the sense that there’s a book on the wall,  <br>because why bother? Get the book. Books <br>are better in the end. Books are forever.  <br>Exhibitions are short-term. Buildings <br>are short-term. Books are forever.<br>I wanted to ask you just a little bit <br>about your time as Dean of Architecture,  <br>Planning and Preservation at <br>Columbia from 2004 to 2014.  <br>Was that a full-time gig, like it would be to <br>be the Dean here; did you feel that you were  <br>doing much research during the time that you <br>were Dean or was the Deanship all consuming?<br>Yeah, okay, I have to roll out <br>the couch to answer this one.  <br>Firstly, it’s not a full-time job, because <br>that implies that there’s a certain amount  <br>of time in the week and then you fill it <br>all out. No, it’s ten times a full-time job.  <br>Basically, you do that during your sleep. You <br>never stop thinking about it. Incredibly exciting,  <br>stressful, complex. You’re like a <br>gardener, you’re seeing what can grow.  <br>Your main responsibility, like that of every <br>teacher, is to the ideas that people haven’t  <br>had yet. How do you create an environment in <br>which people could have ideas that they don’t  <br>have yet? Just try to incubate that, to create an <br>incubator. It’s incredibly exhilarating and super  <br>satisfying when you see it flourish, when you <br>see the flowers grow and you see colleagues and  <br>students do amazing things, but you use <br>every micro-second of your life to do that.<br>So, the answer to your question is, I didn’t do <br>any research, basically, for more than a decade.  <br>I didn’t write. I did a <br>couple of exhibitions just to  <br>stay alive a little bit, but I never <br>made the books that would normally go  <br>with those exhibitions. So, the answer is <br>a big “no”. I basically took time out from  <br>research. That’s why I’m on the couch, <br>because, was that a good call or not?<br>I’m sure that you’ve enjoyed being back in the <br>research space. You’ve certainly been prolific  <br>since then exploring in particular human <br>interactions with technology from radio  <br>and television to social media and artificial <br>intelligence and their relationship to design.  <br>Do you have thoughts on where technology might <br>be taking architecture or the architect now?<br>Not really, but, I immediately want to reverse <br>your question and wonder where could architecture  <br>take technology. Again, the assumption our <br>field would normally have is that technology  <br>is biological, it’s evolving in a <br>certain direction. A fast architect  <br>catches up to that, or a young and fast architect. <br>And we tend to think that young is fast.  <br>Not always the case. We all know that there’s some <br>kids that are much slower and some grandparents  <br>that are faster, but there is an ageism <br>built into the way we think about technology.<br>This was the central focus of the exhibition that <br>Beatriz and I curated in Istanbul. Technology is  <br>what makes the humans human. Technology is <br>the most human thing about us. It is us.  <br>So technology never simply takes us <br>somewhere, since we are technology.<br>Having said that, we are most of the time blind <br>to our technological condition. We don’t really  <br>think about the prosthetics. You and I are <br>looking at each other through our glasses,  <br>through the Zoom and so on, so we act like that’s <br>a technology outside of our body that we are just  <br>using, but of course, we’re different people <br>as a result of these prosthetic extensions.<br>If you take the argument that technology is <br>what makes a human human, you’re saying an  <br>important question is something like, well, <br>what is the future human? Where are we going?  <br>What relationship might architecture have to this? <br>There’s a couple of angles on this. One is what is  <br>the architecture of that, because if it’s my <br>glasses and your glasses, it’s also the room  <br>and the buildings. Of course, the buildings that <br>we occupy are part of us, part of our species.<br>With radio, we became insects. This <br>was an exhibition I did in Rotterdam,  <br>where I tried to explain the idea of the human <br>insect, that we became insects towards the end  <br>of the nineteenth century, as we learnt <br>to communicate to each other with antenna.  <br>We became a different <br>species. We think differently,  <br>and this is both a new kind of human, let’s <br>say a new kind of client for the architect,  <br>but it’s also a new kind of space. We live in <br>a different … you and I are now in a Zoom room.  <br>It has absolutely dramatically changed the status <br>of architecture, but architects hate radio. You’ll  <br>find very little discussion about radio, despite <br>the fact that radio transformed our species  <br>utterly, and transformed space and time utterly, <br>and we claim to be interested in space and time  <br>and humans, and we don’t like to talk about <br>radio because radio seems to insult buildings,  <br>it just passes on through. So the whole history <br>of architecture is a defence against radio.<br>So, for me, there are two sides to <br>your question. One is why don’t we just  <br>look at ourselves, look at what we have become <br>and think about how we then might respond to that  <br>architecturally, like what <br>might our design work be?<br>Also, the implication is that the reason I <br>say, “no,” to your question, I don’t know where  <br>technology is taking us, because precisely <br>technology is the generator of uncertainty  <br>about what constitutes the human. Hence, the <br>question, “Are we human?” Whatever technology  <br>is. I love Marshall McLuhan, almost <br>all of it, but especially his idea that  <br>each new technology changes the human brain <br>and body, and this change is so shocking  <br>that it’s invisible to us. We cannot face it <br>until the technology is replaced by another  <br>one and then we can see it, so we only ever <br>see, as he put it, in the rear-view mirror.<br>So, even looking in the rear-view mirror, <br>architects could respond to radio, television,  <br>and the internet. Probably, if you follow McLuhan, <br>we are already some even stranger kind of species.  <br>I’m convinced that architects need to not <br>only be in the forefront of that conversation,  <br>but are in a sense responsible for <br>that conversation. There are wonderful  <br>thinkers, writers, and curators <br>in and around architecture that  <br>are working on those questions. In that <br>sense, I feel myself part of a community,  <br>but as you can hear from my answer to <br>your question, it’s a super obsession.<br>I mean, to not think about radio and the <br>relationship of radio in architecture is to  <br>be a real idiot. Nobody thinks about <br>radio and architecture. Therefore,  <br>architects are a certain <br>kind of idiot. There you go,  <br>and it’s true. We blind ourselves, and our <br>clients ask us not to consider the fact that we  <br>are a different biological species. Architecture <br>is almost used as a prophylactic, as a kind of  <br>avatar of an old idea of materiality and so on. We <br>almost have a discipline of architecture devoted  <br>to veiling the fact that we have become … Let me <br>just give you one more example. Bacteria. We are,  <br>you and I, bags of thousands upon thousands <br>of bacteria. We can’t be human without those  <br>bacteria, so to be human, to be alive, is <br>to be bacteria and to be with bacteria, in a  <br>very complex co-mingling. How could architects <br>not talk about bacteria? I guess we are just,  <br>I don’t want to say Neanderthal, <br>because Neanderthals were pretty smart.<br>Architecture is a pretty big stockpile of <br>stupidity, not exactly because we’re stupid  <br>as such, but in a way, a kind of stupidity is <br>what’s asked of architecture and we deliver.  <br>At the same time, I’d rather talk to architects <br>than anyone else about what something could be,  <br>because of this doubt thing. <br>So, sorry for the speech.<br>There’s a question in the chat from a student, <br>and that is, could you please share some  <br>practical advice for architecture students <br>about pursuing their career in architecture?<br>Well, it’s, of course, a big mistake, <br>but you’ve already made it. I mean,  <br>when you tell your parents that you’re going to <br>become an architect, their faces fall, you could  <br>have done something serious. So given that you’ve <br>made the mistake and that you’ve joined this group  <br>of people for whom architecture is a question, <br>then you’re part of a very exciting community  <br>of misfits all around the world. There are one <br>million architecture students, more or less,  <br>in the world at any one time, all of whom are <br>excited to think that architecture could be…  <br>What architects have in common is optimism. <br>Despite the fact that actually the world is a  <br>super shitty place, and there’s no <br>reason to be optimistic about anything,  <br>architects are always feeling like even a small <br>change of the physical environment could lead to  <br>a better society, better culture, and so on, <br>so it is astonishing to be part of a community,  <br>who all naively but romantically think that <br>there’s a possibility of a better society and the  <br>way to do that is through some kind of relatively <br>small adjustments to the physical fabric.<br>So, I don’t have advice. I think you’ve already <br>joined this community. It does mean, though,  <br>it’s good to listen and enjoy the fact that <br>we don’t know what architecture is, and if we  <br>don’t know, as a young architect, you don’t not <br>know any more than anyone else. You’re actually  <br>right up there. That’s again, getting back <br>to the spirit of the experimental school.  <br>If the best architects are the ones <br>that feel like they know the least,  <br>then the older architects are jealous of the fact <br>that the young architect really doesn’t know.<br>In a way, take advantage of the fact that <br>you’re in that position of not knowing,  <br>and be reassured that you’re surrounded by people <br>that would like architecture to be boring. Your  <br>role is to resist that, and it’s fun, and you’re <br>not going to get paid. Nobody’s going to love you,  <br>and nobody’s going to quite believe in the idea of <br>architecture. That’s already lost, so just try to  <br>not be boring. I think of all the crimes, boring <br>is the most damning. I have no practical advice.  <br>Just don’t be boring. Why bother? That’s <br>interesting. I don’t think architects are human,  <br>really. Actually, they look human. All architects, <br>from a distance, look like human beings. It’s only  <br>when you get close and you listen to them, you <br>hear that they’re crazy. They really think the  <br>physical world is talking, so you’ve joined this <br>group of kids that think the world is alive.<br>By the way, in thinking that <br>the world is alive, you join  <br>most indigenous communities on the planet, <br>who think that the physical world is talking,  <br>so you’re suddenly in a very, very <br>exciting place. I would totally enjoy it.<br>Fantastic. My final question is  <br>what’s next for Mark Wigley? What <br>are you working on at the moment?<br>Well, to survive being mugged on memory <br>lane. I only ever work on one project.  <br>It’s not important. It’s just a fact. <br>I can only work on one thing at a time,  <br>when I’m researching and so on. The last three or <br>four months, I’m obsessing about a single building  <br>in Havana, a Brutalist building of ’67 to ’71. I’m <br>desperately trying to stop being obsessed with it,  <br>but it’s not working. Basically, if you say, <br>“What’s my future?” I don’t know. I can’t get  <br>out of this building. The text gets longer <br>and longer. I get more and more fascinated.  <br>So I don’t know what comes next, but basically <br>I jump from one project to the other.<br>I’m in a very privileged situation. I also feel <br>a little bit that as a workaholic or whatever…  <br>With the pandemic and so on, none of us know <br>what’s next. Actually, this doubt that I’ve  <br>described before, it’s a kind-of arrogance, if you <br>think about it, when so many people on the planet  <br>don’t know if they can survive to <br>the next day because of poverty or  <br>institutionalised injustice and so on. The idea <br>that there’s a community of people who can claim  <br>that not being paid, like I just said before, is a <br>form of suffering, in order to doubt, then there’s  <br>a responsibility to figure out ways in which that <br>doubt might be of wider use to other species.  <br>Maybe if we thought about other species first, we <br>could think about ourselves better in the future.<br>I think that nevertheless, the pandemic means <br>that even as scholars, I think we have to consider  <br>almost the next project we do might be the last <br>one. If I say, “I don’t know which project comes  <br>next,” I think it doesn’t mean I’m light-hearted <br>about it. I think each one might be the last one.  <br>Maybe the artists and writers and <br>so on that we admire are people who  <br>felt like the next project was it, was the <br>one, finally, and probably the last one.  <br>I think if we all imagine that we’re playing <br>the end game, and it’s not a game, it’s over…<br>But having said all that, then I may <br>be nervous to start the next project.  <br>I always think that way. Maybe this is what <br>there is of an architect in me. Getting back  <br>to the door knob, architects think that <br>the door knob is the beginning of the  <br>physical and emotional relationship to the <br>building. We think always that the smallest thing  <br>has a viral impact on every scale, <br>so people in outer space get improved  <br>by changing the door knob. Maybe as scholars, <br>we feel the same, that even the smallest,  <br>most precise, detailed study of a person or a <br>phase of history has the possibility to transform  <br>the whole thing. I have that arrogance, and I <br>think most writers do. You do. We all do in a way.  <br>Again, the mission is how not to be boring. And <br>if you’re going to be boring, go to the beach.  <br>If the decision is to be boring, then <br>get to the beach as quickly as possible.<br>At least enjoy it.<br>Yeah, the great thing of New Zealand is to get <br>to the beach, it’s never more than half an hour.  <br>I think this thing of the island, this is also <br>why I’m obsessed with this building on the coast  <br>of Havana, because I think islands, and the idea <br>of the island, is so important. Maybe this is once  <br>again, the arrogance of the New Zealander, “Hey, <br>we’ve got the island thing and you don’t.” From  <br>islands, you think about your place in the world <br>differently than those who believe themselves to  <br>be at the centre and believe themselves <br>to be the world. The thought of being  <br>outside the world, but therefore inside <br>your own world, creates a dynamic that’s  <br>super interesting. That seems to be <br>not very different from the dynamic of  <br>making a house for someone. It’s <br>in the world but not in the world.<br>Really, I do believe that all the work that <br>I’ve done is based on this idea of New Zealand,  <br>feeling disconnected. What if architecture’s <br>relationship to all the other disciplines is  <br>the same as New Zealand’s relationship to the <br>world, like I’m not worthy, we’re just late,  <br>we’re not real serious scholars, we’re not a <br>real discipline? On the other hand, what’s more  <br>fundamental than architecture? I think our whole <br>discipline has a kind-of New Zealand sensibility.<br>Thank you so much for your time <br>today. It’s been absolutely wonderful  <br>talking with you, and I <br>really, really appreciate it.<br>Thank you. You’re very kind.
