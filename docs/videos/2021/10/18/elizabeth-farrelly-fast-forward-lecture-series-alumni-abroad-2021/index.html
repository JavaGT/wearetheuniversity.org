And move on.<br>Last week’s series opened with Professor Mark <br>Wigley. Tonight we have Dr Elizabeth Farrelly.  <br>Elizabeth is an architect, philosopher, <br>urbanist, critic, writer, and commentator,  <br>with an impressive cross-genre pedigree. She has <br>embraced local politics, university teaching,  <br>crime fiction, and farming. A <br>very warm welcome, Elizabeth,  <br>superwoman, and thank you for joining us tonight.<br>Thank you, Elizabeth, one Elizabeth to another. <br>One to another. Well, Australia and <br>New Zealand surrounded by moats,  <br>but COVID has infiltrated Sydney. How’s <br>life for you in its lockdown present?<br>Life in lockdown. Well, look, one of the things <br>I’ve just done in lockdown is move house,  <br>which has been nightmarish as usual, but probably <br>no worse, in some ways easier, than moving house  <br>normally, cos there’s no traffic and so on. <br>Weirdly for me, I’ve moved from the inner  <br>city where I’ve lived as long as I can remember, <br>to something much more like a suburb, so that’s  <br>curious. But in COVID it feels quite good.<br>I thought you hated them.<br>Well, I thought so too, and there are reasons <br>for this, and it’s not as suburb as it might be.  <br>It’s still quite tight, as Sydney tends to be in <br>its inner suburbs, but for me it feels like being  <br>almost in the country, ‘cause there’s trees and <br>grass and front yards and back yards and things,  <br>which I never expected to have again. But I’ve <br>done this curious thing. Anyway, so, interesting.<br>And probably very wisely <br>since you can’t go anywhere.  <br>You can at least look at the back garden.<br>Well actually, in Sydney you can’t afford <br>anything. There’s nothing in the inner  <br>city just about, except a shoe box, for <br>less than about three or four million  <br>dollars. You know, one of those things.<br>Auckland’s rapidly following. <br>Yes.<br>Anyway, I think you were born in Dunedin. <br>I was.<br>I think you contemplated a career in medicine, so  <br>what diverted you into architecture?<br>[Laughs] Yes, it’s ancient history of  <br>course now. So, I enrolled in medicine. <br>I applied for both schools of medicine,  <br>but I had family and my father teaching at the <br>Auckland school and a sister who was a student  <br>there, and so I decided to go to Dunedin because <br>I always liked to do things the difficult way I  <br>suppose. I thought it would be fun to get out of <br>home, but one of the curious things about Dunedin  <br>medical school then – possibly still, I don't know <br>– is that it had an intermediate year, and because  <br>I’d got a scholarship or something, I was exempted <br>all of the normal science subjects for my medical  <br>intermediate so I could do whatever I liked. I <br>chose philosophy and ancient Greek art I think,  <br>and English literature, and maths. As you do.<br>That sort of tipped me sideways from thinking  <br>that a future in the sciences was gonna be fun, <br>to thinking that something a little bit more  <br>humanities-organised would be interesting. Then <br>I ended up doing second year of those studies in  <br>Auckland and sharing a house, a funny little old <br>timber cottage in Parnell, with a couple of – or  <br>one in particular architecture student – Geoff <br>Fletcher, who was great. Some other of his friends  <br>used to hang around and they used to draw all <br>night and sit up drinking coffee and having a lot  <br>of what looked like fun. I thought, maybe I should <br>do architecture. It was a silly as that, really. <br>Well, Mark Wigley last week described his time <br>as a student at the University of Auckland  <br>as loose. What are your reflections of your era?<br>Oh look, I think back on that time as an  <br>extraordinary privilege. I mean, it probably <br>isn’t gonna happen again the way it happened  <br>then because university was free for us. In <br>fact, we got paid bursaries and things to go  <br>to university and that pretty much covered <br>the rent, so you had to work a little bit in  <br>the holidays but not very much really. And we all <br>lived in the inner city. I lived in Parnell and in  <br>Herne Bay and Ponsonby. So, <br>I walked to university every  <br>day, and you could do that for just about nothing.<br>You could live for almost no rent in Grafton,  <br>when Grafton was still Grafton, and <br>what that meant was that every night  <br>– or certainly every night from Friday through <br>the weekends – there were funny little parties  <br>in those tiny timber cottages that used to <br>sprinkle themselves through Grafton Gully,  <br>which was basically covered in bush with funny <br>little streets. So it’d be, go to the Kiwi,  <br>or whatever the other pubs were called, and <br>then where are the parties? And everyone would  <br>pile into cars – half of them much too drunk to <br>drive, of course – and go off to these parties. <br>Life was really easy and sort of idyllic <br>I suppose. It sounds terribly hippy now.  <br>I don’t even know if the Architecture School’s <br>still organised like this, I’m sure it’s not,  <br>but we moved into what we called the new building <br>in my second year I think, or first year. Anyway,  <br>sometime during the course. But for the first year <br>or two I was in so-called Timber, and we had that  <br>lovely Railway Hostel down next to Elam in the <br>gully. That two-storeyed veranda job, where you  <br>could remake rooms and people could sleep over and <br>just work all night or do other things all night. <br>It was so loose, is right, but also to me, after <br>all of that sciences and literature and stuff  <br>and brainwork, it felt unbelievably creative. <br>I was just blown away by architecture and by  <br>the sense that you could live that way, but also <br>combined with that was the discovery that space  <br>could mean something, and I just thought that <br>was astonishing. It had never crossed my mind  <br>before. I remember that feeling in first year <br>when I’d think, ‘Whoa, this is amazing.’ So,  <br>yeah, it was cool. We were very lucky.<br>Yeah, it was a wild time. I’m sitting in the  <br>building that you moved into, tonight.<br>I recognise the concrete. <br>Really interested, particularly now that you’ve <br>given us a wee bit of background in terms of your  <br>journey into architecture, with your 1981 thesis, <br>which was Inside Out: The House as a Mask. I found  <br>it didactic and deliciously peppered, if I might <br>say, with poetry, suggesting that you were already  <br>veering away from a tectonic future. I also found <br>in it, I think, the seeds of much of your later  <br>work as well; the morality of architecture, <br>the yearning for beauty, for truth. I laughed  <br>that you concluded with Noël Coward’s Cocktails <br>and laughter, what comes next? Nobody knows! So  <br>what did come next, apart from more cocktails <br>and laughter, in the decade after graduation? <br>That was a very romantic exercise, wasn’t it? I <br>actually was completely intoxicated writing that  <br>thing. It sounds like it, I think, now you’re, <br>‘Whoa, she was drunk.’ I mean, I wasn’t drunk,  <br>I was drunk on all the ideas, but so much fun.<br>So, after that I went to work for what was still  <br>called JASMaD, and that was fun, actually. I <br>got semi (I suppose you’d call it) head-hunted,  <br>invited to apply or to take a <br>job there as a young graduate,  <br>and that was a lot of fun and we worked the museum <br>(I’ve forgotten what it’s called now) in Hamilton,  <br>and the director, Ken Gorbey, I <br>just discovered recently to my  <br>astonishment, not only became the director <br>of Te Papa, but also then later of one of my  <br>most beloved museums, which was the Holocaust <br>Memorial in Berlin, and was instrumental in making  <br>that into the most fantastic thing. Nevertheless, <br>we worked with him. That was a lot of fun  <br>because he was a great client, he had a lot <br>of humour and imagination, I suppose really,  <br>but I already found architecture, as you suggest, <br>kind of frustrating. I loved the ideas in  <br>architecture and still do up to a point, insofar <br>as there are ideas, but I suppose I was seeking a  <br>clearer manifestation of ideas than you can <br>actually probably get into built form. Also  <br>I’m impatient, so I probably found writing, when <br>I came around to it, more instant gratification-y,  <br>and that’s really what happened next.<br>So, after a couple of years at JASMaD I left,  <br>relatively late as the expectation ran. Most <br>people left quite young, younger than I was.  <br>I think I was 26 or something by the time I <br>went to the UK and logged in to London and  <br>[laughs] – typical me, knowing nothing, knowing <br>nobody, with no money, no connections, no sense  <br>of what I was gonna do – and stayed with a friend, <br>Mandy Reynolds, who’s still in London, in Camden  <br>Town. Again, so lucky, I think we had the top <br>half of a funny little terrace house in Camden  <br>Town which Ken Livingston had rented out for four <br>pounds a week or something, as short-life housing  <br>cos it was gonna be demolished, which I don’t know <br>if it ever was, perhaps it was. So, I lived in the  <br>attic there for a few months while I found a job.<br>I took a job in Bristol first, and after about a  <br>month realised that Bristol was gonna bore me to <br>death, even though it’s very pretty. I looked at  <br>the map, thought, ‘Bristol’s by the sea, isn’t it? <br>Let’s go there.’ Of course, it’s not by the sea,  <br>it’s by the river, and it’s very sweet but <br>staid. They wanted me to be the design architect,  <br>this firm I worked for, and that was <br>all a bit — it was huge responsibility,  <br>and I think I probably chickened out slightly.<br>Anyway, I ran away and took another job in London  <br>and worked on the Docklands, on the Royal Victoria <br>Dock. This was when Thatcher was in charge, but  <br>before the Docklands was converted. I was working <br>with a firm called Pollard, Thomas &amp; Edwards,  <br>and Richard Rogers’ firm was doing the master <br>plan of the Docks. This is also typical me,  <br>I kept arguing with the bosses, as one does, and <br>telling them that we should be talking to Richard  <br>Rogers because they were doing the master <br>plan and what would happen if, for example,  <br>they did a light rail, which they eventually did, <br>and shouldn’t we be across that? They said, ‘No,  <br>of course not. We’ll do our own work.’ So, <br>I thought that was silly. I’ve always been  <br>rather oversupplied with arrogance I think, <br>thinking that I was right about things. <br>Anyway, as luck would have it I … actually I was <br>having … Allan Wild, who was then the Professor  <br>of Architecture, was over in London for one <br>of those Commonwealth boards that he was on,  <br>and it was summer, and the summer shows were <br>on, including the end of year show at the AA,  <br>so it was June I guess. I’d been <br>to see this show, which had work by  <br>people like Zaha Hadid and Nigel Coates, and <br>Ron Arad, and I was incensed. I thought it was  <br>fatuous, most of it. We were having a glass of <br>wine somewhere and I was having a rave about what  <br>rubbish this work was, and he said, ‘Well, don’t <br>tell me. Write it down and send it to someone.’ <br>I’d really only written one thing before <br>for publication, and that was in New Zealand  <br>for New Zealand Architects, I think that’s what <br>it’s called, so there was that one piece and that  <br>was it. I thought, well okay, I’ll do that. So, <br>I wrote down what I thought and got the office  <br>typist – back in the day when people still had <br>typists – to type it up for me, and I thought,  <br>whoa, this is fantastic. I love doing this. I sent <br>it to a magazine – a weekly called Building Design  <br>in London – and they put it, not on the front <br>page, but on the inside of the front page I think,  <br>or something like that. Suddenly I was notorious <br>in London, cos you don’t say things like that  <br>about the AA. I didn’t know that. I just <br>thought, well, I’m gonna say what I think. <br>So, I was just blundering in, and really on <br>the basis of that I was more or less offered  <br>a job at the Architectural Review as assistant <br>editor. It sounds blindingly improbable and lucky  <br>now, and it probably was, but Peter Davey <br>was the editor of the AR and he said,  <br>‘You know we’ve got a job going here, do you?’ <br>I’m going, ‘No, no I didn’t.’ I nearly said no,  <br>cos I thought, don’t be stupid, why would I <br>wanna write about it? I wanna be an architect.  <br>Then actually Winston Barnett, who later became <br>my husband, said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous. You do not  <br>say no to offers like that. At least talk to him.’ <br>So, I did, and thought, oh maybe that’ll be fun,  <br>and it was. So, that’s how I switched horses <br>and had an absolute ball lobbing in to  <br>what was then in the middle <br>of Westminster in London,  <br>as a complete ingѐnue.<br>Well, the wonderful serendipity of youth. <br>Yes, just lucky really.<br>Why did you leave? <br>Why did you leave New Zealand? Or leave the AR?<br>No, the Architectural Review? <br>Well, I probably shouldn’t have to be honest. <br>Again, that was probably to do with my arrogance.  <br>I was there for about four years or something, <br>and I had a lot of fun. I mean, I was  <br>sent to Genoa and Houston to talk to Renzo Piano. <br>We did a special issue or something on Renzo, and  <br>I got to do most of it and to follow him round the <br>place and stuff like that, so that was really fun.  <br>Again, I used to argue with everyone because <br>they did things that I thought was disgraceful,  <br>like selling too much advertising and publishing <br>things that none of us thought were terrible good.  <br>In other words, not being principled enough for <br>me. I’ve always been a bit puritanical about  <br>principles. And that always gets me into trouble, <br>and I should really just keep my mouth shut. <br>What really impelled me to leave in the end was <br>Winston and I both, we were offered, by various  <br>means, and we came to Sydney and we met Neville <br>Quarry, who was then head of RMIT — not RMIT,  <br>[NSW] School of Architecture. We also went to <br>Auckland and we each did a three-month visiting  <br>lectureship at the Auckland school, which was <br>a lot of fun. I think it was the offer of that,  <br>and I said to my boss Peter Davey in London, <br>‘I wanna go and do this thing,’ and he said, ‘I  <br>can’t give you that time off. I can’t lose you <br>for three months.’ I said, ‘Well, I’m gonna go  <br>anyway,’ whereas I should’ve said, ‘Oh, okay, <br>let’s find a compromise,’ but that wasn’t me. I  <br>said, ‘Well, you’ll have to sack me then,’ <br>and I think he did, or something like that. <br>I ended up throwing it away for the chance to <br>do the academic thing, which was a lot of fun,  <br>but I probably should have stayed. I should have <br>stayed in London certainly. Whether I should  <br>have stayed at the AR I don’t know, because I <br>never really wanted primarily to write for a  <br>professional audience. I really love writing <br>for the public, which has got to be the least  <br>successful and remunerative way of <br>writing about architecture, but I love it. <br>That’s why in London I fell in love, because <br>there are so many fabulous newspapers. I used to  <br>read what everyone called The Grauniad, cos it was <br>full of typos – but the Times and the Spectator,  <br>and the Independent, and all sorts right across <br>the political spectrum. I just loved that rude  <br>literary tradition and the tradition of <br>criticism that you get in London where everyone  <br>would say, ‘Oh this is the worst building he’s <br>done for years, and he never was any good anyway.’  <br>And instead of suing they would just argue it out, <br>everyone would just pile on it, and it was just  <br>such a lot fun. Their use of language was elegant <br>and the use of ideas was also sharp and focused,  <br>and I loved that about the public artistic <br>and cultural debate in London. It’s great. <br>Do you think London’s still like that? <br>I don’t know. Probably not as much. I mean, I <br>suspect that the dumbing down that’s happened here  <br>has happened everywhere in Western culture to some <br>extent, but probably it’s still got that strand,  <br>I suspect, I bet, if you want to be part of <br>it. That’s one of the things that I loved about  <br>the UK actually, was that there were <br>lots of different — it was so complex  <br>as a culture and as a society, and that meant that <br>there were lots of different parts of it you could  <br>be within. It wasn’t just a single hierarchy – <br>in Sydney it’s mostly about money – you could be  <br>impoverished gentry or real gentry, you could <br>take that stuff seriously or not. You could  <br>be an eccentric and part of that artistic <br>world, and they were more or less separate,  <br>and I felt as though they all had their own <br>dignity in some ways. So, that was really fun. <br>And wonderful eccentricity.<br>Yes, you can be as nutty as you like. Like Boris,  <br>for example, and everyone thinks, ‘Oh, that’s <br>just him, her,’ you know? So, that was lovely.  <br>I often think in some ways, even though you can’t <br>really do that properly probably, as a foreigner,  <br>I often think that’s maybe more me. I don't know. <br>Anyway, you have these regrets. Sometimes I think  <br>I should have stayed in Europe, cos Europe <br>also feels very much home to me, culturally. <br>I share your views. Anyway, you returned <br>to Sydney, and then in the mid-‘90s,  <br>you served as a City of Sydney alderperson and <br>councillor. So what tempted you into politics?  <br>That art of looking for trouble?<br>So, I arrived in Sydney and pretty much,  <br>not quite immediately but very <br>soon after — that was end of ’88,  <br>and we got married and I got pregnant, so I was <br>suddenly thinking, oh whoops, having a baby,  <br>as you do. Life is full of accidents somehow. <br>It wasn’t really an accident, but anyway.  <br>I had a call from the book editor from the <br>Architectural Press in London saying, ‘Can you do  <br>a book? A book is a really good thing to do while <br>you’re having a baby,’ and I’m thinking, really?  <br>Not that he would have known, of course, and <br>it was a bit silly. Then I thought, I’m still  <br>a bit bored, so why don’t I do a doctorate?<br>At the same time as all of those things,  <br>I was writing already for the Herald. <br>Someone said – Graham Jahn, actually,  <br>and Michael Dickinson. Graham Jahn is now the city <br>planner, but back then he was a young architect,  <br>and he and Michael Dickinson, who later died <br>sadly, took me out for coffee and said, ‘You know,  <br>if you’re gonna be here in Sydney you should <br>write for the Sydney Morning Herald. Ring them up  <br>and tell them that they need you to write about <br>architecture.’ So I did, and this lovely arts  <br>editor, Peter Cochrane, said, ‘Okay, well, <br>send me something.’ So, I sent him something,  <br>and I started to do that fortnightly.<br>So, I was doing all of those things and  <br>of course writing about architecture, I <br>was already getting up everyone’s nose,  <br>which seems to be the thing I do. I’m not <br>sure that I quite do it deliberately, but I  <br>seem to do it regardless. I did write a thing <br>about East Circular Quay, which was then  <br>just a gleam in the eye of the developers, and <br>Eugene Kohn was actually in Sydney from New York,  <br>cos he’d designed a scheme for it and it <br>was a really horrible building, and I wrote  <br>something saying, ‘It’s too big, too wide, too <br>ugly, too dreadful, too enclosed.’ This big  <br>black box shopping centre thing. It was a <br>shocker, and I wrote something saying that. <br>Frank Sartor, who had been an independent alderman <br>– we were all aldermen when we were elected – and  <br>had been sacked, they all got sacked, as happens <br>here, and the council was being reconstituted. So,  <br>there were new elections coming and he said, ‘Why <br>don’t you stand on my ticket?’ I said, ‘Don’t be  <br>ridiculous. No interest in politics, and I don’t <br>like telling lies, and why would I do politics?’  <br>Then I thought, hang on, wait, this could be fun.<br>I’d been reading Jonathan Barnett about urban  <br>design and how urban design is really about making <br>the rules. Not making the buildings but making the  <br>rules that shape the buildings, and I thought <br>that was an interesting idea. I thought this  <br>might be a chance to play with some of that stuff, <br>so finally I said yes, and that was June or July  <br>’91. That was quite late and they’d printed the <br>ballot papers. You had to put your names down to  <br>do it and the ballot papers were already printed <br>when somebody realised that I wasn’t actually a  <br>citizen, and you do have to be a citizen to be <br>elected here, so then I had to be fast-tracked  <br>through the citizen machine and get done.<br>The Barnaby Joyce problem. <br>Yes, exactly. So, I’m still dual, but that might <br>be … So, it was a whole interesting process,  <br>and I have to say I found politics absolutely <br>fascinating as well as absolutely infuriating,  <br>but really a lot of fun.<br>Well, I wondered if you  <br>left politics on the high tide of <br>accomplishment or in a fury of frustration? <br>Well, both actually. You know, Keating, we had <br>a very pro-development state government, and  <br>again by luck, we had the numbers in <br>council. There were seven councillors, and  <br>because Randolph Griffiths, who was actually <br>part of the right-wing, the Liberal party,  <br>crossed the floor to vote with us cos he thought <br>we had better policies, which was sweet of him,  <br>and so we had the numbers on council. Then we <br>had this very oppositional and aggressive state  <br>government that kept just wanting to say yes <br>to everything in the long tradition of Sydney. <br>Then Keating was in the federal <br>government, so he was kind of on our side,  <br>and so we made alliances with the federal <br>government, which is unusual in city politics,  <br>and he became very helpful even though <br>there is no formal role, of course,  <br>for the federal government in local politics. <br>But he was very interested in Circular Quay,  <br>and so we had a lot of fun and we got some things <br>done that we might not otherwise have managed. <br>I think I got myself a reputation for being <br>quite hard line in the principle department.  <br>Uncompromising, which I always thought was a good <br>thing, but apparently not if you’re Australian. <br>So, having children and writing a doctorate. <br>I tried that one, and it’s not that easy. <br>Yeah, no it’s not.<br>I was quite intrigued that your thesis  <br>was the Sydney height of building storey, which <br>exposed the intellectual cultural and political  <br>background of central Sydney development in the <br>early- to mid-20th century. At first I thought it  <br>might have actually supplied the plot for your <br>foray into youth thrillerdom, Caro Was Here,  <br>but that seems to be an unravelling <br>school truancy. So, what attracted  <br>you to investigate Sydney’s height controls?<br>Oh look, that was an accident. I didn’t really  <br>want to say that at all. I mean, I was <br>engaged – embroiled, I suppose – in local  <br>politics by the time that really got going, <br>so I had access to a lot of the documents,  <br>which was useful. Actually, what I wanted to <br>do, and if I had my time again I would have  <br>gone to a completely different faculty and <br>asked them to take me in, because actually –  <br>try and find a way of saying this without <br>being completely libellous – I found the,  <br>and I still find, the intellectual underpinnings <br>of architecture irritatingly precarious.  <br>What I actually wanted to study was something <br>like the relationship between individualism  <br>and modernism. That struck me as being really <br>interesting, and I still think that’s quite  <br>interesting and I would like to have done that. <br>The thing I had in mind would have been much more  <br>somewhere between social theory and geography <br>and psychology, probably a bit more like  <br>Blubberland, as it later turned out. <br>But I couldn’t find anybody within  <br>the architectural faculty who had a faintest <br>clue what I meant by any of that, and everyone  <br>seemed to think this terribly dull and not the <br>least bit engaging or interesting or fruitful. <br>So, I got persuaded into doing something much <br>more real and on the ground and practical,  <br>in a way. It was really an historical <br>investigation in the end, and it wasn’t  <br>un-useful. I was looking for the ideas behind the <br>transformation of Sydney from a 12-storey city to  <br>a whatever-you-like tower city, and the truth <br>is, there weren’t any ideas. There’s nothing  <br>that would pass for an idea. The most interesting <br>thing about it really was that New York at the  <br>same time was undergoing pretty much exactly the <br>same transformation, except that New York already  <br>had quite a few skyscrapers by then, cos it had <br>been competing with Chicago since the 1880s. <br>New York … the same arguments and the same <br>kind of beautification commissions and the same  <br>public health commissions and investigations and <br>hearings were going on, but they were just so much  <br>more erudite and so much more rational in their <br>argument, and even the discussion. There were  <br>discussions in parliament because Sydney ended up <br>imposing a law which was a building height limit.  <br>I mean, really? In the parliament their arguments <br>would not hold water for a moment. I mean,  <br>it was just as idiotic then as it is now.<br>I used to read through all these hansards  <br>and think, these guys are morons, what? They may <br>not have been morons, it might just have been that  <br>they’d actually made all the decisions in back <br>rooms in private, which is what they still do,  <br>and this was just really filibustering. <br>But anyway, whatever the reason was,  <br>the whole discussion in New York was <br>immensely more educated and interesting and  <br>ideas-rich than it was here. So, I found it <br>really frustrating and disappointing actually,  <br>but I suppose it’s interesting to learn that.<br>Ah well, you spun it into pretty racy text  <br>in Blubberland: The Dangers of Happiness <br>in 2007 and Killing Sydney: The Fight for  <br>a City’s Soul which you’ve just published this <br>year. I really encourage everybody to read it  <br>because I think it’s absolutely fascinating.<br>I thought it was really interesting that  <br>your Auckland thesis, returned really in <br>Blubberland where you looked at the house  <br>as a mask and adopted persona, carapace for the <br>soul, and now flipped into everything, as far as  <br>I could follow, that’s killing us and the planet. <br>All that McMansion madness and obesogenic suburban  <br>ugliness. I found it interesting, capitalism <br>and democracy essentially a love song embroiled,  <br>and indeed with very well-meaning planners.<br>Anyway, and then  <br>cutting Sydney. A utopia disintegrating, <br>really. Aesthetically, kinetically, politically,  <br>ecologically, gender-ly, and spiritually, and <br>all this orchestrated by modernist architects,  <br>property developers, traffic engineers, and <br>unfortunately again, those pesky planners.  <br>I found it very much a kind of a love/hate <br>dichotomy, or full of dichotomies really.  <br>Love/hate with Sydney, city life, <br>architecture, planning. I was thinking,  <br>in your view, what is the perfect city? <br>Well, I suppose the perfect city is not <br>perfect, that’s part of it. That’s why  <br>I end up using somewhere like Canberra as a sort <br>of whipping boy really, which may be a little  <br>bit unfair and I know people in Canberra <br>get slightly offended, not surprisingly.  <br>I remember thinking – not when I was in Rome, <br>but I think about Rome – that there’s something  <br>(and New York is a bit like this too, cos I <br>think New York is very like Rome actually)  <br>in this regard that it always feels slightly <br>out of control. You never have that sense that  <br>anybody is actually capable of controlling it, <br>and that’s quite comfortable. Not completely out  <br>of control, but just a little bit on the edge.<br>I remember reading this thing about Rome saying  <br>that the underground sewer system and so on were <br>so complex that they could never eradicate the rat  <br>problem because they could never actually get <br>to all of the places that they hid. I thought  <br>maybe that’s the mark of it, where it’s big enough <br>and complicated enough and intricate enough that  <br>it can’t be controlled by the domineering forces <br>of humans. I think that’s really nice, so it makes  <br>it feel a little bit like a piece, perhaps, of <br>nature rather than culture or a kind of mix. <br>That’s one of the things I love about Sydney, <br>of course, is that sense of intertwined nature  <br>and culture, where they’re really intricately <br>engaged with each other so that they can’t be  <br>disentangled. In the book I used a picture, which <br>you can see a lot in Sydney, of one of those fig  <br>trees bulging its bark and trunk material – <br>flesh – through this wrought iron fence and  <br>around it, so that neither could <br>be removed without destruction. <br>And I think that is part of what I love about <br>Sydney. It’s not really about perfect, it’s about  <br>a city where, as a kind of biped with a desire <br>to engage and with a mind that likes to pick up  <br>ideas and respond to places, that kind of <br>biped, where that kind of person can feel  <br>comfortable and at home and endlessly interested.<br>For me, inner Sydney, even though it is now  <br>trying to destroy itself, is still like that. <br>You can still walk those Surrey Hill streets,  <br>and even though they’re full of people with five <br>million dollar houses now, the barrister classes  <br>and upwards (or downwards, perhaps you might <br>say), you can still feel its history of  <br>Opium dens and the rag trade and the <br>razor gangs and the slums where Ruth Park,  <br>all those Harp in the South stories, and <br>where the kids just dreamed of nothing but  <br>escaping that territory, where it was actually the <br>worst possible place to be. I find those stories  <br>and those laneways and the fact that that <br>fabric is still largely there, enchanting. <br>London does that for me too, I have to say. <br>London also has that sense of storied-ness. When  <br>you wander round the ends of court, <br>and it doesn’t matter that it’s full of  <br>very wealthy, well-connected people, because the <br>12th century is still lying there for you to smell  <br>and touch and feel, and I love that. Love it.<br>I noticed that you were also a huge fan of  <br>Barcelona and Paris and Istanbul. I did notice, <br>though, that was no mention of Auckland. <br>Oh, there was a little bit. I think Auckland <br>figures, but slightly in a bad way because I think  <br>I remember saying something like, ‘Sydney did <br>not do what Auckland did in the ‘80s,’ which is  <br>drive swathes of motorways and mirror glass <br>through its centre. I was slightly heartbroken  <br>about Auckland. You know, the Auckland that <br>I remembered walking around everywhere as a  <br>student had lots of those funny little stone steps <br>and little alleyways and funny little shops and  <br>explorable places. I realise now that <br>I did a lot of that as a student,  <br>going and visiting Rodney Kirk’s mess in <br>his little gallery, and just exploring.  <br>It was very explorable. Then came all of those <br>motorways that just went [expressive sounds], and  <br>there was that coarsening of the grain that came <br>with the huge mirror glass push of the ‘80s,  <br>and I was really sad about that with Auckland. <br>It’s not why I left, but I was sad about it. <br>Sydney didn’t do that then. <br>They’re trying to do it now a bit,  <br>but it didn’t do it then, for all sorts of curious <br>reasons. I once said it jokingly to a journalist,  <br>‘You know, I think it was just too corrupt to <br>get its act together, to actually make anything  <br>out,’ and he wanted proof, which I don’t have. Of <br>course, it probably was, but also there were some  <br>political reasons. Neville Wran was a Premier for <br>a while and he deliberately frustrated the roads  <br>lobby by putting the entertainment centre, for <br>example, right where a motorway was meant to go,  <br>and planting other buildings, major <br>institutions, in the middle of road reserves. <br>So, it was strategised, which was great, <br>and we should be grateful. We did have some  <br>larrikins like that, and Jack Mundey’s another <br>one who saved heritage and protected The Rocks  <br>from being turned into tower and slab buildings, <br>according to Seidler, almost singlehandedly by  <br>bringing the unions out in force. So, there were <br>some heroes of the time as well as the corruption. <br>The Rocks is a bit of a model in the <br>end for the Britomart and a bit of  <br>civic activism here, which was great.<br>And the Britomart’s turned out well. <br>I have to say, you wouldn’t remember me <br>at all, but you were a great after-dinner  <br>speaker at a millennium international urban <br>planning history conference in Sydney,  <br>and at the time you reminded <br>me of a young Germaine Greer.  <br>I’m inclined to think of you now as a kind <br>of a latter-day antipodean Jane Jacobs.  <br>Your work has a lot of parallels, I think, with <br>the death and life of great American cities, and  <br>actually in Killing Sydney, she was one of <br>the few people who didn’t earn your scorn. <br>Right, yeah. She was brilliant, actually, <br>wasn’t she, and well ahead of her time. <br>But I’m just wondering, who have <br>been your role models in life? <br>I do have some. I’m not sure that I’m terribly <br>conscious of them. I mean, I did think,  <br>and I do think, Germaine was wonderful. I’ve <br>met her a few times. She’s terribly scary  <br>still, even now of course.<br>I think she’s got scarier actually. <br>Possible, she was very funny as a young woman. I <br>mean, I’ve seen footage which I didn’t know about  <br>then, and I remember thinking that her feminism <br>was probably a bit extreme for me. Not extreme,  <br>but perhaps her expression of it was a bit <br>strident perhaps, which might surprise some  <br>people; a lot of people think I’m very strident.<br>My role models are probably  <br>writers, in other words they’re writing <br>models more than role models. What I  <br>do – which I’m quite sure is ridiculous and naïve <br>– is I think, well, this is what I think and I’m  <br>just gonna write it down. Then I don’t have to <br>push the send button, I can always just not,  <br>and then I usually do anyway, and I think <br>there’s nothing wrong with telling the truth.  <br>I think that might be where my naivety comes in. <br>And I have read – who was it? One of the French  <br>writers, someone like Balzac, who said, ‘Writing <br>is an exercise in indiscretion.’ It reminded me of  <br>one of the filmmakers who said, ‘Writing is <br>like taking your clothes off and running naked  <br>in public,’ and it is. It is that sense of, <br>‘Oh my god, I’ve really done it this time.  <br>Everybody’s going to absolutely laugh me off the <br>stage this time,’ and then just doing it anyway. <br>I think there’s a sense that, for me, and I’m <br>not really sure where this comes from, it might  <br>be to do with my early love of philosophy, that <br>the truth is more important than most things,  <br>and especially in public debate as opposed to <br>private. I mean, I’m much more polite in private,  <br>but in public conversation I think <br>it’s really important to be able to be  <br>rude and critical and truthful, really truthful, <br>because I actually do think that that’s how  <br>culture improves. We tend to be much too <br>polite in public. We grizzle in private and  <br>are polite in public, where I think it should <br>really probably be the other way round,  <br>and we should be more robust in our public <br>critique and in our public personas and  <br>not take everything personally and recognise <br>that there’s an important difference between  <br>the public realm and conversation in the <br>private ones. To think, well, okay fine,  <br>he thinks that and I’ll say this, and not get so <br>emotional about it, because politics has become so  <br>emotional and it’s just boring really.<br>I think we’re seeing the death  <br>of truth over the last few years.<br>Yes, and I think that’s terribly dangerous. <br>I was really quite intrigued too that you tend <br>to have a bit of a love/hate relationship with  <br>women in your books as well. After all, they <br>shop and consume. In Blubberland you also  <br>argue that they’re blessed, albeit marginalised, <br>with a capacity for strategic vision, empathy,  <br>and a transformative energy you call love. Indeed <br>in Killing Sydney they return again to focus on  <br>soft and seductive interiors and not the male <br>fixation on hard, shiny, erectile exteriors.  <br>Do you think a reconciliation of this <br>binary is relevant or even possible? <br>So, of course a lot of people take offense at <br>the idea that there’s a binary, and I mostly  <br>have to preface this conversation with an argument <br>that says I’m not talking about male and female  <br>people so much as male and female principles <br>here, which I think is useful. I think it’s a  <br>useful distinction to draw and doesn’t necessarily <br>apply or correspond one on one with the actual  <br>human beings, who are much more complicated. <br>For example, you can have a female biology  <br>and a fairly male kind of mind. But I do think <br>the binary thing is useful. I think that there  <br>are differences, which help understand what’s <br>going on spatially as much as psychologically.  <br>Is it useful? Well I think reconciliation <br>… I mean, there’s a kind of war, of course,  <br>between one and the other, but I think that it’s <br>true to say – I think it’s reasonable at least to  <br>argue – that the 20th century has been extremely <br>masculinist in ways that are not always obvious,  <br>because it’s also been a century of feminism.<br>Despite feminism and despite the whole hippy  <br>peace movement, which I think <br>was itself extremely sexist,  <br>the status of women has in a lot of ways gone <br>backwards in the last two or three decades,  <br>due not least to Trump and all of that. <br>It’s probably more pronounced somewhere  <br>like Australia than somewhere like New Zealand <br>where at least you have Jacinda. So, I’m not  <br>sure about reconciliation. I like to think that if <br>we were capable of being slightly more civilised,  <br>then we would all recognise that actually fruitful <br>cultures employ both principles in more or less  <br>equal degrees and in different ways, in a perhaps <br>often oppositional engagement, but in a way that’s  <br>reasonably respectful and therefore quite <br>creative, and that probably that’s the best way  <br>of producing a response to climate change quite <br>apart from anything else, but also good cities. <br>Also, interesting parallels with how agriculture <br>works too, and the need for what I think of as  <br>female thinking there. It’s not exclusive to <br>females, of course, but there’s a sort of — when  <br>I say ‘strategic’ I think — I mean, I have been <br>accused occasionally of being a misogynist and  <br>possibly I have said things that sound that way <br>or maybe are, but I think also I don’t think I  <br>really am and I do think it’s very important <br>to recognise that what women have to offer as  <br>women – what female thinking has to offer perhaps <br>– is more concerned with the future and better  <br>at taking a long view for that reason.<br>That’s because we are obviously concerned,  <br>and so are men, but perhaps more concerned about <br>and more able to see through the eyes of our  <br>children and their children and their children, <br>and that whole thing of planting a tree now so  <br>that in a hundred years great-grandchildren <br>can climb it and can breathe the air  <br>is very important. I do think that to recognise <br>and deploy that view in what’s now bleeping red  <br>as our survival is really important and would <br>be very useful if we could do it more properly. <br>Particularly with the code red news <br>from everywhere and inter-governmental  <br>climate change panel. I’ve really <br>enjoyed your thinking, I have to say,  <br>in terms of climate change and in terms of <br>thinking about the how to — well actually,  <br>in many respects, how to return to what we <br>actually had in terms of compact, walkable city  <br>life. How feasible do you think this is in these <br>pandemic times where, I mean, dense city is almost  <br>a dirty word. We all have to stand two Alsatians <br>apart. We’re going through a very, in a sense,  <br>anti-city-richness phase, the pandemic is.<br>Yes, and I think there is a danger that the  <br>pandemic will send us all back into relentless <br>sprawl, which will really put the seal on  <br>irreversible climate change. It’s entirely <br>possible. But it seems to me that it’s also  <br>possible that the opposite of that will <br>emerge from the pandemic, which is that  <br>it’ll demonstrate to us that one of the things we <br>absolutely love is community. We love being in,  <br>not just community, but society. I mean, Thatcher <br>said, ‘There’s no such thing as society,’ and I  <br>think it’s proved that she’s wrong, that we need <br>collective action. Not only that, but that we love  <br>being in busy streets and markets and places with <br>other people, and just walking up the road to buy  <br>some carrots and having a chat with people along <br>the way. That’s fun, and not being able to do that  <br>shows how valuable it is to have those streets.<br>I think it’s possible that we can learn that  <br>lesson, and I also think that this is a huge, <br>and should be the overwhelming and overriding,  <br>task of architects and architecture <br>right now, is demonstrating that  <br>what what’s-his-name called proximity rather <br>density, that that can be done in a way that’s  <br>beautiful and enchanting, and not horrible. I <br>don’t think that the 1.5 metre separation thing  <br>necessitates living in separate suburban houses. I <br>don’t think it follows, but if we’re not careful,  <br>that’ll be the knee jerk response.<br>I think it’s up to architects now  <br>to imagineer a future that seduces us all into <br>going, ‘You know what? This is an opportunity to  <br>do something we haven’t done before and it could <br>be cool.’ To some extent it’s reinstating the old,  <br>the traditional idea of a town, which is quite <br>well-defined and quite dense but small-scale in  <br>the centre, and then surrounded by quite <br>clear and distinct countryside, but also  <br>doing it in a way that’s contemporary and <br>connected and interconnected and digitally  <br>systematised. So, I actually think, if you see <br>it that way, it’s an opportunity for excitement,  <br>and that’s how we should take it.<br>Ebenezer Howard’s garden city with fibreoptics.  <br>I have often off and on read your columns in the <br>Sydney Morning Herald, and I think it’s utterly  <br>admirable that you’ve been able to continue <br>writing for so many years and the well has never  <br>run dry of really good ideas. Even in your recent <br>columns, they’re full of towering phalluses and  <br>spitting oysters and open-plan living trap, and <br>I just wonder, thinking about this vast opus of  <br>work that you must have now collected, what’s <br>been your most controversial opinion piece? <br>I’m not sure that I know the answer to that, but <br>one of the ones that’s most long-lived in terms of  <br>the degree to which people still pillory me about <br>it, is one where I said, ‘Malcolm Turnbull could  <br>be the best Prime Minister and the most enduring <br>Prime Minister of Australia since Menzies.’  <br>People still say, ‘Oh, you <br>…’ I remember Malcolm from  <br>the spy catcher days, and he was brilliant and <br>funny and interesting and, it seemed to me,  <br>principled. Then of course Malcolm had lots of <br>faults as a Prime Minister, but I still think  <br>one of the things that he had in <br>common with Paul Keating was that he  <br>was very bright and very articulate and <br>was able to use those facts to change  <br>the Australian conversation.<br>I was very disappointed in Malcolm  <br>because he didn’t seem to have the courage <br>to stand for what I think he believed in,  <br>which was essentially climate action. He did <br>earlier on, he crossed the floor on that basis,  <br>but when he was Prime Minister – and I’m sure that <br>there were compelling political reasons why he  <br>regarded it as impossible – but he didn’t do <br>what we all hoped he would do, which was drag  <br>the conservative side of politics toward climate <br>action, which I’m sure he probably still regrets. <br>So people still say, ‘Oh, but you said about <br>Malcolm that he was gonna be great.’ I say, ‘Well,  <br>it’s not my fault that he was a disappointment.’ <br>He had that potential; I was calling it out. I  <br>was actually saying it in the hope that if <br>we recognised it, it would spur him on to be  <br>more that way, which of course it didn’t manage <br>to do. That was certainly very controversial. <br>Oh, and there was the frightbats thing too, <br>which was funny, which was partly based on what  <br>I’d written about. It was 10 years ago and I was <br>actually in Africa at the time, and my phone just  <br>started going wild and I realised it was Twitter. <br>I had written something about cycling. A cycling  <br>piece. I mean, you wouldn’t have thought, would <br>you? It was about cycling through Surrey Hills  <br>and about how on the cycle lane up Bourke Street <br>I’d been stopped by three things. One of them was  <br>some police on bicycles stopped in the cycle lane <br>having a chat; one was a moving man humping in a  <br>mattress to somebody’s apartment; and one was a <br>truck from — and I was silly enough to say from  <br>Merrylands, which I now roughly know where <br>Merrylands is. Then, I just said, ‘Merrylands,  <br>wherever that is,’ and so that was an excuse <br>for Tim Blair, who was the editor or something  <br>of the Daily Telegraph (Murdoch paper), to <br>absolutely go off at me, and he called out  <br>all his flying monkeys, the trolls to trash <br>me on Twitter, which was actually quite funny. <br>Then he called a whole lot of us ‘frightbats’ <br>and accused us – I think 10 or 12 women, writers,  <br>people like Anne Summers and Van Badham and <br>a whole lot of really very smart women – and  <br>he accused us of being terribly emotive and <br>emotional and crying and screaming and tearing  <br>our hair and actually being like witches. It was <br>part of that whole Tony Abbott Ditch the Witch  <br>push about Julia Gillard, but it was profoundly <br>misogynist, and we thought it was terribly funny  <br>and everyone started making frightbat T-shirts and <br>things, but that was immensely controversial and  <br>got me into trouble, of course.<br>So, yeah, that was quite fun,  <br>but that sort of trouble is quite fun because the <br>women in charge, they were in trouble not because  <br>they were emotive but because they were actually <br>pushing an intellectual agenda, and that was  <br>regarded as being immediately pinko, communist, <br>intellectual feminist, inner-city elite,  <br>and you get that whole swag of, ‘We just hate you <br>all,’ which is actually hilarious. I mean, it’s  <br>not much fun at the time, but it’s actually quite <br>funny when you’re slightly more distanced from it. <br>I was going to ask you how <br>you deal with the backlash? <br>I look the other way. I don’t <br>even read it. I mean, honestly,  <br>this is cowardice. It’s partly cowardice <br>and partly that if I do read the comments  <br>I get so — I mean I do get depressed about it and <br>hurt, but there’s another reaction which is worse,  <br>more dangerous in a way, which is that if <br>you — because most of the really vituperative  <br>backlash stuff misunderstands or <br>misinterprets what you say. So,  <br>there’s a tendency to self-censor and not to say <br>things that you think are gonna be controversial,  <br>or not to say things that are intellectual or <br>that are truthful, and to be more appeasing, more  <br>crowd-pleasing. I think that’s really dangerous, <br>and I find that if I do that I sort of start  <br>dumbing it down and then I just get bored. So, in <br>the end I think I write for me because I write to  <br>keep myself interested, as much as anything.<br>You enjoy speaking truth to power, I think. <br>Yeah.<br>Bring it on in fun. <br>So I think, well bugger it, I’m just not gonna <br>do that cos it’s gonna destroy the writing,  <br>and that’s more important. I used to <br>get one of my daughters to read it, and  <br>sometimes she’d say, ‘It’s okay, Mummy, you can <br>read them this week,’ but nowadays I just honestly  <br>mostly don’t care. That’s really disgraceful. But <br>it’s not a game of politics, I’m not trying to be  <br>popular, I’m just trying to say what I think.<br>Tell the truth. So, apart from cocktails,  <br>laughter, and the unknowable future, <br>what are you thinking about doing next? <br>Well, I am thinking, maybe it’s time for something <br>different. I don’t honestly know. I mean, I’ve  <br>become involved in this tiny property – what <br>I call a farm, but it’s not a farm – in the  <br>country. We can’t get there at the moment, which <br>is infuriating, and I have a whole lot of things,  <br>like for years we had drought and there <br>was no grass and we had to feed the cattle,  <br>of which I have six, with hay. Now there’s <br>too much grass and I have to get it cut  <br>before summer otherwise it’s gonna be a serious <br>fire problem, cos it’s waist-high or more, and  <br>fire, you know, climate change.<br>So, I have a few issues,  <br>and I’m very interested in <br>regenerative grazing as a way of,  <br>not rewilding countryside, but <br>actually as a way forward for feeding  <br>and sustaining humanity without destroying the <br>planet, which seems to me to be really the big  <br>issue. So, I’m very interested in sustainable <br>food production and whether that’s possible,  <br>and the way that if you and I — I love biology.<br>One of the things that remains to me from my early  <br>medicine days is my absolute love of biology, <br>and so soil microbes are things I get very  <br>excited about, and the way they build soil and <br>build soil carbon and have this lovely little  <br>symbiotic relationship with the rhizomes that <br>feed the plants, and the way that all works,  <br>and the way that is all killed by 20th century <br>traditional farming methods like superphosphate,  <br>which has also got New Zealand into trouble <br>by eutrophying all of its lakes and rivers  <br>and things. Which is terribly destructive of soil <br>and ends up with soil hardening and compacting and  <br>salination and all kinds of terrible things, <br>which is usually blamed on grazing wrongly. <br>So, I’m very interested in that whole cycle and <br>the way that if you understand the microbes and  <br>the microbes are happy, then they’ll hold more <br>water and the land is more hydrated, and therefore  <br>the rain cycle works better and all that. So, <br>that’s really fun. That’s engaged me for a while.  <br>Not sure whether I’m really up to doing a lot of <br>that. I’ve realised it’s quite difficult to do,  <br>especially if you haven’t got any money, so I <br>might be a bit limited in my capacity to prove  <br>some of that, but I’m still playing <br>with some of those ideas down there. <br>That sounds absolutely fascinating.<br>Yeah, it’s fun,  <br>and also writing, of course. Writing adult <br>crime is the other thing I’m engaged with. <br>I was intrigued last week. Mark Wigley joked <br>that he wrote the same book again and again,  <br>returning always to the one enduring problem. <br>Yeah, it’s the same. If you’ve made that <br>early Masks thesis reappear — I mean,  <br>I think for most people that reads as a kind of <br>crazed gobbledygook. For me, it’s a treasure trove  <br>of all the things I thought were interesting, and <br>most of them I still think are interesting. For  <br>example, the mind-body problem, the relationship <br>between ideas and the real world, which is one  <br>of the things that intrigues me about farming, <br>is how you can translate ideas into material. <br>Practical reality.<br>Yes. <br>And produce one when it’s useful.<br>Yeah, if it pops up again and again.  <br>So it is interesting to look back on a <br>life and see how those things endure. <br>Oh well, I think we should touch <br>base with you on a regular basis to  <br>see how things are going. I really <br>thank you so much for your time,  <br>Elizabeth, and it’s a huge … Oh, <br>do we have time for one question?  <br>Time for one question from Lindley Naismith in <br>fact, asking, ‘Do you think architects have much  <br>traction at all these days among the myriad of <br>other players involved in making city buildings?  <br>Is the profession in its <br>traditional form losing relevance?’ <br>Well, that’s a very good question, of course, and <br>that’s probably a thesis in itself. I’ll answer  <br>the second bit first. Of course, the traditional <br>form of architecture has largely vanished,  <br>which is something that I regret and I’m sure <br>most architects regret, because the architecture  <br>was largely better. I do think that it’s very hard <br>for architects to have any sway in the development  <br>process as it stands. For most architects, <br>most of their work, I think it’s fair to say,  <br>is done through developers, and most developers <br>are so, not just low-brow but mono-cultural  <br>in the sense that they only care about the <br>bottom line, and it’s not true of all but most,  <br>that the result is nearly always disappointing and <br>I think it’s extremely difficult for architects  <br>to stand for anything in that context.<br>I think that the role that I vaguely  <br>outlined before, of architects becoming much <br>more loud, much more vocal as part of the  <br>public conversation, is really important, <br>cos there’s two things about architects  <br>which are really valuable and I think they’re <br>under-recognised and underused. One is to do with  <br>beauty – apart from artists, who pretend that <br>they’re not interested in beauty anymore because  <br>it’s all about messaging – but architects are <br>the only ones, and even we don’t talk about it,  <br>but we all know that that’s the core of <br>the profession, and that everything else  <br>that architects do is done better by some other <br>profession. But the beauty thing, which is to say,  <br>‘Doesn’t that look astonishing,’ that thing, which <br>we never say in public but that’s what it’s about,  <br>that’s actually what it’s about; that’s <br>what we love. That’s why we’re in it,  <br>we wanna make things that are beautiful, we wanna <br>make the world. So, that’s really important,  <br>and that’s a very important role, and because <br>beauty is a love thing, and that’s what we need;  <br>people to love their environment.<br>So, that leads on to the second thing,  <br>which is what architects do, which is draw. I know <br>it’s all done through computers now and that’s  <br>actually really boring and that’s one of the <br>things that’s wrong, but architects can make ideas  <br>of visions of a future, for want of a better word. <br>They can make them look real, they can make them  <br>into a form that people can see. You can do <br>it with words and I try and do it with words,  <br>but a drawing is really powerful, and I just think <br>architects should be involved in the political  <br>conversation about development. They should <br>be out there selling that stuff, selling ideas  <br>in the marketplace to ordinary humans, and winning <br>hearts and minds, because that’s where the battle  <br>is being fought now, and it’s terribly <br>important. It’s just terribly important. <br>I just wish that every institute of architects <br>would be out there pushing that stuff for all  <br>they’re worth. Not getting jobs for the boys, <br>no that’s just stupid, that’s so last century.  <br>This is really about survival and I think <br>architects could be really important in that,  <br>because if we can persuade people that a more <br>dense future is also more beautiful and more fun,  <br>then we’ll buy it. We can do <br>that, and you can do all the  <br>recycling and the zero carbon at the same time <br>and it could be fabulous. Why aren’t we doing  <br>that? Scandinavia shows that it can happen, but <br>we don’t really do that, and I think we should.  <br>So, yes and no.<br>Well, I think that’s the perfect note and a  <br>magnificent answer and a call to arms really—<br>Absolutely. <br>—to finish on, so a huge virtual <br>burst of applause to you. <br>Thank you everyone. Love you too.<br>This is Dr Elizabeth Farrelly.  <br>Thank you so very much.<br>Absolute pleasure.  <br>Thank you.<br>Just to end,  <br>a reminded that the Fast Forward Spring continues <br>next week with Professor Jenny Dixon and myself  <br>in conversation with Jude Kohlhase, Senior Urban <br>Development Specialist with the Asian Development  <br>Bank, and again it will be at 6pm. So, head to <br>our website fastforward.ac.nz for details and  <br>to register for the webinar or use the QR code. <br>Haere ra, goodnight, and thank you to you all.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
