us about her<br>paper that she<br>uh helped author along with um one of<br>our other theme members miranda<br>marosa<br>the paperwork's retail potential of<br>upcycled food<br>evidence from new zealand so francesca<br>do you want to just start by<br>explaining who you are and what this<br>research was about<br>thanks trixie<br>yes so this research project was really<br>about uncovering this new global food<br>trend of upcycled foods where<br>waste and surplus food is converted into<br>new innovative products and to really<br>understand do consumers know what this<br>is and are they ready so foodstuffs<br>wanted to commission some research to<br>understand the demand side of the whole<br>upcycled food system and whether it was<br>worth them exploring investing and<br>innovating in the upcycled food space<br>so researchers from the university of<br>otago food waste innovation research<br>theme from drexel university in the us<br>and the team at foodstuffs came together<br>to design this study<br>to really dig down into what drives<br>consumers and whether they'd be<br>interested in upcycled foods<br>awesome cool um and how did you conduct<br>the research<br>so the research was industry-led it was<br>a survey was designed uh<br>in a collaboration with those<br>researchers previously mentioned and<br>then administered through a online<br>survey tool that<br>was<br>that comprised of<br>supermarket shoppers so new world and<br>pack and save shoppers and this tool is<br>called yabil where people can uh sign up<br>and then they give in some sort of you<br>know they go into into a drawer to win<br>some sort of reward if they answer the<br>surveys<br>so it's a it's a really good way of<br>gaining consumer insights on new food<br>trends so we used the yavel panel to<br>interview<br>over a thousand consumers on the topic<br>wow<br>and what were some of the findings from<br>the research<br>so the key findings were that although<br>only 10<br>of consumers identified straight<br>straight out the gate that they had<br>heard of upcycled foods before<br>after the definition was explained to<br>them 81 of those consumers<br>uh identified that they were at least<br>willing to try or buy upcycled foods so<br>that really shows that<br>the concept<br>of upcycling and that connection between<br>food waste to new food product resonated<br>with consumers<br>one of the other interesting findings<br>was consumers were asked to imagine a<br>food product and all things in terms of<br>quality price taste<br>uh considered equal how likely they<br>would be to opt the upcycled version of<br>the product over the conventional one<br>and 69<br>of consumers identified that they would<br>be just as likely if not more likely to<br>opt for that upcycled version so that<br>further reiterates that there is<br>consumer demand there and consumers are<br>interested in seeing these products<br>available in supermarkets<br>another really interesting finding was<br>that<br>uh our final question was how the<br>customers would perceive a retailer if<br>they stocked up upcycled foods and 97 of<br>customers<br>said that they would be<br>just as likely if if not more likely to<br>view the retailers positively<br>by stocking up cycled foods so it really<br>shows that there's minimal risk and<br>retailers are you know investing and<br>uh introducing these products into their<br>stores it's not going to damage their<br>reputation with their customers<br>wow that's really cool<br>um and also i suppose and incentivizes<br>food manufacturers as well to get into<br>the space um if it's got a really high<br>retail rate<br>yeah absolutely it builds confidence<br>from along the whole value chain from<br>from producer to retailer through to<br>consumer uh that<br>yeah this this food trend is<br>something that is viable and you know<br>studies international studies have<br>indicated that<br>the upcycled food<br>value chain is worth 46.9<br>billion us dollars<br>uh with a compound annual growth rate of<br>five percent so the size of the prize is<br>really big and these consumer studies<br>just build that evidence that the demand<br>side's there as well<br>awesome um so what would you like to see<br>next in this space following on from a<br>study like this<br>yeah so we got a really good baseline of<br>what consumer sentiment was towards<br>upcycled food but it was in an online<br>environment where you know that<br>consumers weren't really able to<br>interact with the upcycled food products<br>or really imagine what it would be like<br>to purchase them so um<br>we through the food waste innovation<br>theme we've actually<br>done a subsequent follow-up study<br>looking<br>at consumer perceptions of upcycled food<br>in an in-store environment so partnering<br>with an upcycled food company<br>to provide consumers an opportunity to<br>see<br>try<br>and experience that upcycled food in a<br>in a supermarket context and see how<br>that uh how that affects their<br>perceptions of the product<br>great thanks so much for talking to us<br>francesca and um<br>hopefully<br>everyone who uses our resource
