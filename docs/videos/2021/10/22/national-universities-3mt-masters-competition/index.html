be your mc for this event<br>my university the university of waikoto<br>is proud to host the 2021<br>masters 3mt competition<br>we are just very sad that because of the<br>extraordinary times in which we live we<br>cannot welcome you onto our beautiful<br>campus<br>instead we will be coming to you under<br>the current level three restrictions<br>from different living rooms and<br>different office spaces<br>around the waikato and around new<br>zealand<br>i thought because this event is<br>wonderful it's event that fills me with<br>joy and pleasure and delight hearing<br>people to talk with passion about their<br>research that this is quite a grand<br>event and so i thought the place in my<br>house that symbolizes the most my<br>feelings of excitement about this event<br>are my living room and the kind of<br>symbolic grand piano so i've got my<br>party frock on i've got my hair ornament<br>in and i am ready to listen to all kinds<br>of exciting presentations from our six<br>speakers this<br>evening i was thinking a little bit<br>about the way in which we come to you in<br>digital form tonight<br>and in many ways i think this is<br>symbolic of the times in which we live<br>and the way in which we've all had to<br>get used to communicating through zoom<br>and recordings and rather than<br>face-to-face communication communication<br>mediated by a screen<br>i'm also struck by the wonderful<br>resilience<br>of the organizers of this event who've<br>had to change plans multiple times and<br>so a big thank you to our school of<br>graduate research to our communications<br>and marketing team it is through their<br>skill through their organization through<br>their perseverance that this event can<br>take place<br>above all however this is an event which<br>speaks to the resilience the courage the<br>insight and the passion of the master<br>students you're going to hear from<br>it is very difficult to research at the<br>best of times<br>even more difficult in an environment in<br>which travel is limited and<br>communication face-to-face is limited in<br>these covered times<br>so this comes to you with my respect not<br>only for these six students we're going<br>to hear from today but all the students<br>researching throughout new zealand<br>continuing to be passionate and<br>committed to their work even although it<br>is particularly challenging<br>it is now my great pleasure to introduce<br>you to professor bryony james<br>she is the deputy vice chancellor of<br>research here at the university of<br>waikato and she has some words of<br>welcome<br>welcome to the finals of the national<br>three-minute thesis competition for<br>master's students we were so looking<br>forward to welcoming you onto our<br>beautiful campus here at tafari walanga<br>or waikato the university of waikato<br>but kovid has decreed that this has to<br>be a virtual<br>event i hope that families and friends<br>of the presenters are gathered at home<br>and will make as much noise and<br>excitement as an in-person event but<br>even if you're sitting at home alone in<br>your bubble<br>you're quite likely to be moved at the<br>conclusion of these talks to cheer and<br>clap and whistle and shout<br>you know what go ahead and if your<br>neighbors call noise control on you<br>you're doing it right<br>because this evening we are going to<br>hear from six exceptional research<br>students each representing their<br>university in this final<br>the topics cover every aspect of the<br>environment from volcanoes to forests<br>from the urban to the rural<br>through memory and movements and even<br>into the shadows<br>research is about answering questions<br>but the answer means nothing until it's<br>communicated and the way researchers<br>usually communicate their research is<br>through published papers conference<br>proceedings symposia and of course their<br>thesis<br>what sets tonight's presentations apart<br>is the particular challenge facing our<br>presenters<br>we are going to get a whistle stop tour<br>through their whole research journey<br>in only three minutes<br>that's pretty speedy stuff<br>so fasten your seat belts and enjoy the<br>ride<br>thank you so much to professor bryony<br>james for that lovely welcome on the<br>behalf of the university<br>i am now joined by three very important<br>people our wonderful judges who are<br>sharing their time and expertise to<br>choose our runner-up and winner<br>without further ado i'm going to ask<br>my name is rachel corrales i'm from<br>caldwell pacifica we're based here in<br>hamilton wakato we're a pan pacific<br>organisation that delivers well-being<br>services to people from all ethnic<br>backgrounds and our point of difference<br>is that we use specific models of care<br>and practice<br>i myself i'm samoan my mum was from<br>samoa i was born there my father is from<br>taranaki so we've got strong roots that<br>hail back to taranaki but i've been<br>we've been as a whanau here in the<br>wakata region for 30 plus years now so<br>we've got strong roots here<br>i'm actually<br>an otago undergraduate and my<br>association with the university of<br>waikato has been as a mature student<br>and i've been<br>linked through the south<br>leadership program which was awesome if<br>you if any of you ever get the<br>opportunity but more recently been doing<br>work with some of the different schools<br>throughout the university little<br>research projects around things that uh<br>seek to improve the holistic well-being<br>of pacific communities really excited to<br>be here i think this is such an awesome<br>initiative<br>and i'm looking forward to all the<br>videos thank you<br>yoda my name is kyle beatham i'm the<br>chief executive officer of the galahad<br>group we here at gallagher are long-term<br>strong supporters of the university<br>whether it be through the galahad<br>performing arts centre or various<br>scholarships across<br>the cyber school and the engineering<br>schools<br>along with multiple business advisory<br>boards as well<br>i'm here to represent the high-tech<br>business portion of society and are<br>super excited to be part of this so<br>thank you so much and good luck to all<br>hello everyone my name is nancy keiser<br>and i grew up in singapore lived in<br>england and came to new zealand in 1993.<br>i have been involved with the university<br>just over 20 years through the<br>scholarship office having set up a<br>scholarship<br>uh<br>all those times back and uh being<br>involved with seeing what's happening uh<br>in the university especially<br>which is uh where my passion is i'm very<br>much a community person<br>being involved with the art scene here<br>in hamilton through mesh sculpture<br>hamilton through boone sculpture<br>tribune street art as well<br>and um this is<br>being a judge in this is quite an<br>exciting<br>venture because it's outside my level of<br>comfort but uh<br>i've<br>i'm looking forward to the judging and<br>the discussion and good luck to all the<br>people who have taken part thank you<br>we've met our judges and soon we will be<br>hearing from each of our six presenters<br>but before we move to this stage of<br>proceedings we need to know the rules of<br>engagement<br>firstly and most importantly each of the<br>presenters has only three minutes to<br>share their research insights and<br>passion<br>this is a really difficult thing to do<br>as a lecturer at university i'm used to<br>50 minutes at least to share with my<br>class and insight into something we're<br>studying<br>to distill all of the knowledge and all<br>of the research of a master's thesis<br>which takes students a year to complete<br>down to three minutes this is a fine art<br>a difficult thing to do<br>so as bryony encouraged you to do as you<br>listen to these presentations at home as<br>you celebrate with your friends your<br>family your colleagues<br>cheer<br>celebrate<br>raise a glass in support of the<br>wonderful achievement of these<br>researchers<br>as well as the three minutes<br>each presenter can only have one single<br>static slide<br>to illustrate in visual form aspects of<br>what they're talking about<br>they can't have sound and video files<br>they can't have props and they have to<br>use the spoken word as their<br>communication tool<br>the rules explicitly state no rap songs<br>no poems no singing it's the voice and<br>the power of the voice to communicate<br>the two crucial criteria on which each<br>of the presentations will be judged is<br>firstly comprehension and content<br>do we have a clear understanding of what<br>this research is about<br>secondly the criteria of engagement and<br>communication<br>the ability of the speaker to make their<br>topic live for you and for i listening<br>i did my masters in english here at the<br>university of waikato<br>and now i teach here and i'm a teacher<br>of literature<br>so when i'm thinking of the thesis in<br>three i think of it first and foremost<br>as an opportunity to share a brief story<br>of what your research is<br>why is it important<br>what are you researching why does it<br>inspire you<br>another way of thinking about this is as<br>an elevator pitch<br>what would you say about your research<br>if you were in a lift with someone who<br>is a specialist in your field someone<br>you look up to and respect you've only<br>got those few flights to captivate them<br>to persuade them of the importance of<br>what you're doing<br>how do you do that in three minutes<br>we now turn to the six presentations<br>six wonderful masters students from the<br>length of new zealand we have<br>presentations from canterbury and otago<br>victoria and auckland waikato and<br>lincoln<br>and we have such an array of topics<br>from farming as a business<br>to restoring urban forests<br>from human lipid seal cohabitation<br>to human movement and mobility during<br>covert<br>we will learn about children memory and<br>time<br>and firstly our first presenter is going<br>to share his insights into<br>volcanoes<br>kyoto koto i'm charles cheng and this is<br>my three-minute thesis presentation<br>did you know that millions of new<br>zealanders live on active volcanoes and<br>we don't even know when or where they're<br>going to erupt from<br>whether it's the busy city life of<br>auckland the ski fields of mount luapehu<br>or hiking the tongariro crossing<br>all of these places are found on active<br>volcanoes that could erupt at any time<br>with little to no warning<br>my study focuses on mount uapehu an<br>active volcano located in the middle of<br>the north island of new zealand to try<br>and understand<br>when and where the volcano will erupt<br>from in the future<br>i use the most basic volcano monitoring<br>tool you can think of<br>using your eyes to watch the volcano<br>over the past few months i've been<br>climbing up mount luapehu to observe and<br>take images of its crater lake<br>also known to local aerie as te wai amoi<br>you can see in the top left image a<br>photo of me enjoying myself up the<br>mountain once i've climbed up to the<br>crater lake<br>i've been doing this because the crater<br>lake is the place on the volcano where<br>all historical eruptions have come from<br>and in the top middle and top right<br>images you can see some of these<br>previous eruptions<br>which didn't seem to bother the<br>snowboarder that much<br>so once i've taken these photos of the<br>crater lake i've then been analysing<br>them to identify any dark patches or<br>yellow patches on the lake surface<br>and you can see these and the bottom<br>right image if you follow the black and<br>white arrows and look really closely<br>the dark patches are where sediment is<br>being brought from the vents beneath the<br>lake up to the lake surface by volcanic<br>gases and the yellow patches a sulfur<br>which has also been brought from the<br>vince beneath the lake up to the lake's<br>surface by the same volcanic gases<br>i've also been looking at how the lake<br>changes color over time which you can<br>see in the bottom left image is really<br>grey because of volcanic gas mixing<br>sediment into all of the lake water<br>while on the bottom right image taken<br>one month earlier the lake is a lot<br>bluer because of glacial melt water<br>input<br>one cool finding of my study is i've<br>identified five volcanic vents beneath<br>the lake and this is really exciting as<br>only two of these were known about<br>before my study<br>and you can see my vents as the red<br>hollow circles and the bottom right<br>image<br>another new finding of my research is<br>that the lake is far more dynamic than<br>previously thought and this will likely<br>change the way that gns science monitors<br>the volcano<br>all of this information helps to better<br>predict when and where the volcano will<br>erupt from in the future which will<br>allow people to be evacuated from the<br>busy ski slopes on the volcano before it<br>erupts and will hopefully save lives<br>thanks for listening nord ada tina koto<br>imagine this<br>little eight-year-old rosie is being<br>interviewed by investigators about<br>alleged sexual abuse that occurred over<br>a year ago<br>she has provided a lot of information<br>about who where and what but<br>investigators are very much interested<br>in the way<br>they press her for exact dates and being<br>primed to always give things a go she<br>gives them some<br>but as it turns out the only suspect had<br>a solid alibi for these given dates and<br>they walk free<br>but how do we know that rosie provided<br>accurate information<br>an incorrect order one long day even one<br>long hour could mean the difference<br>between safety and justice and the<br>potential for further abuse<br>and that's what my research is about how<br>children can remember time-based<br>information such as dates but also other<br>elements like duration and chronological<br>order<br>this type of information is critical in<br>the criminal justice system because it<br>can greatly aid in an investigation by<br>establishing a timeline of events or<br>providing the ability to cross-check the<br>alibis of suspects<br>it often comes up in trials to cast<br>doubt on a child witness's credibility<br>but we don't actually know much about<br>how accurate children are at doing this<br>nor how they do after a long delay since<br>the target have been occurred<br>covert 19 provides us with a unique<br>research opportunity it's a dynamic<br>naturally occurring and global event of<br>which the effects and consequences have<br>been available have been felt by all<br>the pandemic has many parallels to what<br>a child might be interviewed it's<br>stressful and novel is being integrated<br>into daily life and has occurred over a<br>really long period of time<br>now this might be the closest we can get<br>to ethical ecological validity without<br>experimental manipulation<br>i am conducting interviews with children<br>aged 6 to 14 about their memory of new<br>zealand's cover 19 lockdown<br>questions such as when did lockdown<br>start how long do lockdown last for and<br>what order did the four loot levels<br>happen and demand specific answers and<br>limit how investigators might question a<br>trial for a case<br>responses will be coded and analyzed<br>based on their accuracy<br>this research will benefit the field of<br>forensic interviewing because whatever<br>the results we will be better informed<br>about how realistic it is to expect<br>children to provide us with accurate<br>time-based information when interviewed<br>following our crime<br>criminal investigations should be done<br>with the protection of the child the<br>defendant and society in mind so<br>perhaps it's in no one's best interest<br>to press children for time-based<br>information<br>i was working in a marina when out of<br>the murky water within an arm's reach<br>appeared the head of a three metre<br>penguin eating apex predator<br>i was staring into the eyes of a leopard<br>seal named alfa the world's first urban<br>leopard seal<br>leopard seals famously live in<br>antarctica so to see one in the middle<br>of auckland city was unusual to say the<br>least<br>however i recently co-authored research<br>which showed that they have been<br>encountered by thousands of people right<br>across new zealand<br>when humans and wildlife cohabitate<br>negative impacts are often reported by<br>stakeholders so with humans and leopard<br>seals now cohabitating in new zealand it<br>is important to determine what impacts<br>are being perceived so that the<br>well-being of both people and seals can<br>be insured<br>the negative impacts of human lipid seal<br>cohabitation may seem obvious leopard<br>seals have a fearsome reputation as<br>anyone who's watched happy feet can tell<br>you and humans don't have the best<br>reputation when it comes to harassing<br>wildlife<br>however little researchers looked at<br>what happens when humans and leopard<br>seals meet so i set out to see how we<br>are getting along in new zealand<br>first i surveyed auckland marina users<br>to record their perceived impacts of<br>cohabitation and 85 came back with at<br>least one negative impact these range<br>from she's getting in the way of<br>accessing boats to she's damaging dings<br>and fenders but the most common was she<br>might hurt someone<br>so next i interviewed people who had<br>encountered orpha to learn more about<br>her behaviour and how dangerous it might<br>be<br>i was told many accounts of offer<br>suddenly popping up next to people as<br>they walked along the marina or road in<br>their boats and a diver told me how she<br>swept through the water and came to a<br>stop right in front of her and then just<br>looked at her<br>she and many other interviewees felt<br>that woofer was simply being curious and<br>they ultimately enjoyed their encounter<br>despite any initial fright<br>however author didn't seem to enjoy the<br>encounters that weren't on her terms as<br>when a young man tried to touch her she<br>raised her head high and made a loud<br>grunting noise before turning and<br>slipping into the water<br>i also looked at the behaviour of<br>leopard seals resting on otago's beaches<br>and saw that they could sleep all day<br>but they were disturbed if a person or<br>dog approached within 20 metres<br>this research showed that negative<br>impacts are being perceived by both<br>people and seals during cohabitation in<br>new zealand<br>but that many encounters had a neutral<br>or positive impact<br>with this knowledge we have the power to<br>manage our interactions so that the<br>seals get the rest they need and we can<br>have an enjoyable encounter the next<br>the un has declared the 2020s as the<br>decade for ecosystem restoration<br>our cities<br>where about 87 of new zealanders now<br>live<br>those are degraded ecosystems and they<br>need healing as much as any rainforest<br>when you picture a city what do you see<br>i see grayness<br>steel smog<br>cities are for humans and not for nature<br>forests are something far away<br>well<br>i'm part of a world first project<br>highlighting the benefits of restored<br>urban forests for humans and wildlife<br>we study these patches all throughout<br>new zealand cities and across decades<br>worth of restoration work<br>from today<br>i want you to look for the forest<br>patches planted along your daily commute<br>those are critical havens in an<br>otherwise barren desert where most<br>native species don't stand a chance<br>my team in this project is looking<br>underground<br>the most diverse ecosystem on the planet<br>is hugely understudied<br>and it's right beneath our feet yep one<br>teaspoon of soil contains more organisms<br>than there are people on earth<br>so it's time that we understand forest<br>restoration from the ground up<br>in my thesis i'm sampling all of our<br>sites for soil microorganisms and miso<br>fauna which are critters under one<br>millimeter mainly mites and springtails<br>that range of life that i'm studying is<br>comparable to the taxonomic range<br>between humans and fungi<br>so discerning what functions all of<br>those tiny guys provide for our urban<br>whenua<br>and just how abundant or absent they are<br>in a given area<br>will help us understand the key patterns<br>to reviving soil communities<br>for example<br>we assume that age is key<br>the more time that has passed since the<br>tree planting began<br>the better and richer life in the soil<br>and then life above ground will be that<br>makes sense right but<br>we could be wrong<br>maybe it's more to do with which tree<br>species we plant regional differences or<br>something entirely different<br>the point is the results that we find<br>could form a blueprint for the future of<br>urban planning and forest restoration<br>we could prevent money wasted on<br>plantings which don't survive because<br>good soil turns crises into<br>opportunities<br>it is literally the foundation of all<br>life ecological and economic<br>so<br>in the age of doing better<br>you could say the 1920s were roaring and<br>the 2020s<br>are for restoring<br>namihi<br>this<br>is a covert 19 announcement<br>at 11 59 tonight auckland<br>alert level 4 lockdown again<br>gyms<br>malls schools and non-essential services<br>will shut<br>travel out of auckland is restricted<br>you have five hours before lockdown<br>begins<br>so how do you react<br>where do you go<br>according to media reports many of you<br>and your phones will rush to the<br>supermarkets panic buying toilet paper<br>while others will self-evacuate to<br>batches across the borders<br>but were these reports actually true<br>where were we moving during lockdown and<br>did aucklanders adhere to health advice<br>to remain in their local neighbourhoods<br>normally our movement is predictable<br>with routines in the places we visit the<br>people we interact with and the ways we<br>commute<br>but covert changed this<br>historically mobilities researchers used<br>time-consuming travel surveys and<br>interviews<br>with small sample sizes<br>but there's now an abundance of data<br>available from your mobile phone<br>locations<br>every day advertisements within apps<br>like facebook<br>uber<br>tinder and google maps<br>are tracking your location<br>selling gps coordinates to researchers<br>like me<br>these apps running in the background<br>provide a near continuous record of your<br>personal movement<br>i'm using machine learning on millions<br>of phone locations finding trips to<br>users homes<br>workplaces and destinations like<br>supermarkets<br>i'm testing the significance of changes<br>to the duration frequency and types of<br>trips before and during lockdowns<br>and while i've only just started my<br>method is showing potential on test data<br>on the left is messy raw data<br>this square the size of albert park<br>contains over 5<br>500 data points for more than 500 mobile<br>phones<br>and on the right after analysis is a two<br>hour long gps track from one anonymous<br>phone user who was walking between bars<br>late at night<br>so why does this matter this sounds<br>creepy<br>i'm using privacy protecting methods to<br>visualize our movement through cities<br>seeing if lockdowns magnified social<br>inequalities for different neighborhoods<br>and demographic groups<br>and thankfully my lockdown scenario<br>tonight is fake<br>but these mobile phone locations are<br>real<br>you could be one of my mobile phones<br>so thanks for participating in my<br>research<br>imagine if you were a rice farmer you<br>worked so hard to cultivate your rice<br>you harvested and now it's time to sell<br>it but like yay it's payday<br>and then you're approached by trader you<br>give a price for your rice she's like oh<br>no that's too high there isn't much<br>demand for your rice and then you reduce<br>the price<br>sad but this is the story of most mojo<br>the rice farmers in ghana because of the<br>low demand for locally produced rice<br>they are unable to fully participate in<br>the market<br>low demand for rice is attributed to the<br>relatively low quality of local rice<br>which is attributed to the inappropriate<br>milling equipment used in processing<br>rice<br>so<br>what can be done to improve the demand<br>of local rice well this is where my<br>study comes to play my study proposes a<br>joint venture model to solve these<br>issues simultaneously<br>the idea is that<br>farmers with the objective of improving<br>the marketability of their rice and<br>improving their income should partner<br>with strategic partners also looking to<br>source from these small others and also<br>looking to make some profits<br>these two entities will pull resources<br>together to establish a business with a<br>sole objective of improving the quality<br>of rice that farmers would produce<br>this will be done through an inclusive<br>value chain process which includes<br>adequate post-harvest techniques<br>improved mailing processes better<br>packaging and the lies<br>the business will produce rise of good<br>quality which will actually be in demand<br>by consumers<br>farmers will get better prices for their<br>rice and also make profits and dividends<br>from being partners of this business and<br>so were the strategic partners<br>although this is a brilliant idea we'll<br>first like to know what farmers think of<br>this business oriented concept that is<br>why my study will analyze the needs and<br>preferences of farmers to the attributes<br>of this model<br>using a discrete choice experiment we<br>will elicit farmer's preferences for the<br>model<br>data analyzed from this experiment will<br>tell us the attributes farmers value and<br>those that they do not and this will be<br>used to modify the model so that in<br>future when it's implemented we'll know<br>that it will actually suit farmers<br>preferences<br>and this is a step to rearranging<br>farmers from subsistence farming to<br>farming as a business<br>okay<br>so on behalf of my fellow judges carl<br>and rachel i just want to say a huge<br>congratulations to all the candidates<br>who've<br>been so brave<br>in putting the presentation across to us<br>to judge<br>it's um it's a big task um to wither<br>down your<br>probably months and months of work into<br>three minutes and we really appreciate<br>that we appreciate um that you put<br>yourself out there and um we've totally<br>one of the amazing things that really<br>compelled us was how impactful the<br>topics were and in a really really<br>practical way<br>where you can see the link between the<br>the problem that's trying to be solved<br>and the practical application in the<br>world how you could actually imagine a<br>future where it's been brought to life<br>i've heard many times before in my life<br>that the indication of a of a clever<br>intelligent person is actually the<br>ability to articulate complex ideas in<br>really simple terms<br>and i think the ability to crystallize<br>comprehensive bodies of research into<br>concise precise and captivating material<br>is something that will hold all of the<br>participants and in particular the six<br>finalists and really good steed and<br>their personal and professional lives<br>moving forward and we certainly saw that<br>in the in the material that we<br>we were very impressed with the<br>presentation<br>the uh six candidates did their very<br>best to get the ideas across to us<br>um<br>slides was one of the criteria that we<br>were looking at and<br>some candidates use their slides very<br>well<br>more so than others but nonetheless the<br>overall presentation was still excellent<br>and the body language was<br>came across well in some cases not so<br>well in others but overall i think that<br>it did<br>it did enhance<br>the content the clarity of what was<br>being said<br>and the impact of the um of the research<br>project so thank you very much we we<br>loved it

listening<br>research can often be quite a solitary<br>and lonely thing to do<br>and we need our why now and our friends<br>round about us so to all you who have<br>come to support these six contestants<br>i thank you for your commitment to this<br>research in providing nurture and<br>providing a listening ear and providing<br>sometimes financial support and most<br>importantly providing their atmosphere<br>of nurture and love which is vital<br>we also can't do research alone we need<br>particularly our colleagues and our<br>supervisors who can offer advice and<br>structure and collaboration so thank you<br>to all the supervisors of these six<br>masters students and the wonderful work<br>environments that they are part of<br>this is a competition and we have<br>celebrated the runner-up and the winner<br>and we thank the judges for their time<br>and expertise and wisdom in coming to<br>what is a very challenging and difficult<br>decision<br>i am particularly grateful for all the<br>organisational and technical help and<br>support from the school of graduate<br>research here at the university of<br>waikato<br>and our comms and marketing team<br>this event requires so much planning and<br>re-planning in these extraordinary<br>covered and locked down times<br>and we need that expertise in ensuring<br>that the event can come together<br>that the recordings can be woven<br>together in a seamless whole i thank you<br>for all you have done for making this<br>event possible<br>most importantly i want to thank the<br>speakers our six finalists in this<br>year's competition<br>i have learnt so much from you by<br>listening to your three-minute thesis<br>presentations<br>i've learnt to look at soil in a<br>different way<br>a teaspoon of soil containing more<br>microorganisms<br>than people on the planet<br>i have learnt of the need for<br>partnership between farmers and business<br>communities in order to help both the<br>productivity and quality of what farmers<br>are growing to improve but also to<br>ensure that there's an all-important<br>local demand for the product<br>i have learnt of the different ways in<br>which memory and time operate for<br>children and i've learned to be cautious<br>in judging time from an adult standpoint<br>when thinking about the way in which<br>children perceive and remember events<br>i have learnt about all that can be<br>observed by the eyes we're looking at a<br>volcano and that the study of the<br>evidence of past events can help predict<br>what might happen in the future<br>i have learned that sometimes perhaps my<br>suspicion of big data and surveillance<br>is something that i should set aside to<br>also value all the excellent information<br>that research about this big data can<br>provide the way in which sometimes it<br>might be very necessary to dispel some<br>of the myths and the stories that<br>circulate particularly in a time of<br>crisis<br>and i have learned that lipid seals<br>might sometimes be a little bit scary<br>but they're also just as curious about<br>humans as we are about them<br>thank you speakers for the research that<br>you are doing for the discoveries that<br>you are making<br>research is such a wonderful kind of<br>coming together of both passion and time<br>and effort<br>so i wish you all well in the remainder<br>of your studies<br>and i encourage anybody who's watching<br>with a passion for something with with a<br>love of research and study to pursue<br>that dream<br>i've enjoyed your company and i wish you<br>all the very best look after yourselves<br>goodbye<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
