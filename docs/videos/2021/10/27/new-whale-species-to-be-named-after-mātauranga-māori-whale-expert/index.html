Its scientific name will be Mesoplodon eueu, referring to its Indigenous roots in South Africa, and its common name Ramari’s beaked whale after Ramari Stewart, a Mātauranga Māori whale expert.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>a new species of whale has been<br>discovered by a collective of<br>researchers led by the university of<br>auckland waipapa tomataro<br>nihongore turned up i knew that was<br>something different<br>i hadn't seen it before i just kept the<br>pressure on<br>with the department of conservation that<br>this whale is special i recovered the<br>whole skeleton at my<br>at my home in in south westland at<br>okorito<br>and 12 months later i took it to the<br>music to tapa<br>ramari stewart is a renowned whale<br>expert who was raised by her elders in<br>the traditional maori knowledge of the<br>sea<br>one of the original specimens used in<br>the research originated from south<br>africa<br>what we have is both genetic and<br>morphological evidence<br>that truespect whales from the northern<br>hemisphere and the southern hemisphere<br>are distinct species<br>and with new species comes a new name<br>and we really wanted to connect this new<br>species for the southern hemisphere with<br>the peoples of the southern hemisphere<br>and in particular<br>peoples that are connected or inhabit<br>the lands where we draw our samples or<br>specimens from for this new species<br>we approached indigenous groups in both<br>arterial new zealand and south africa<br>which are lands from which from which<br>important specimens have been drawn<br>in aotearoa new zealand researchers<br>approached mataranga multicultural<br>advisor bradford harmony<br>everyone felt that ramadi who<br>really identified the species and and<br>actually you know did all the hard work<br>to find it and<br>prepare it<br>uh for identification<br>that uh that her name should be placed<br>on it to recognize a lot of her money<br>but it also it's a female whale<br>um it's also will be the first time that<br>an indigenous woman<br>has had a name<br>attached to a marine mammal species<br>guided by the queerson council a name<br>from the quidam language meaning big<br>fish was chosen<br>it's wonderful now that western science<br>is starting to recognize<br>that matoranga maori which is indigenous<br>knowledge is is equally as great as<br>western science and the two<br>can work together<br>but rather than bridge that relationship<br>you know<br>and keep taking<br>from indigenous practitioners taking<br>their knowledge it is better that we<br>both sit at the table<br>and make a contribution there ramuri<br>brought enormous knowledge to this<br>project<br>she was the first to recognise how<br>special nuhonori is and that set us off<br>on a journey that has ended in a new<br>species of whale for the southern<br>hemisphere<br>she has prepared nuhonori for te papa<br>and essentially prepared this treasure<br>for the whole of new zealand<br>and it goes to show<br>what can be accomplished when you<br>collaborate and work alongside<br>indigenous knowledge and masaranga maori<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
