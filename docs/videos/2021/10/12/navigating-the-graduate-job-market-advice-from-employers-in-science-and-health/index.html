font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my piece of advice for students<br>navigating the job market would be to to<br>make use of their networks be active on<br>social media utilize linkedin networking<br>is is really key in in today's market<br>the piece of advice you really need to<br>take is to study the job description you<br>need to look at the competencies in<br>there that's where the questions will<br>come from the interview<br>make sure that your cv and covering<br>letter are clear and concise<br>and really show your passion about why<br>you want to apply for that role it's<br>often the minor details that count<br>double check that you're actually<br>sending it to the correct company that<br>you put there we do see that happen<br>quite a bit make sure that you have<br>shown that you've done your research<br>have a look on their website<br>particularly in their about us section<br>and try and reference something to show<br>that you've actually done your research<br>for this application keep your<br>opportunities open so don't narrow<br>yourself into one idea look broader than<br>what you're expecting to apply for don't<br>be afraid to apply for something you're<br>not the perfect fit for i think you'll<br>find that no one is the perfect fit for<br>a job and they're looking for someone<br>who can add value in some capacity so if<br>you think you're generally a good fit<br>give it a go and be confident really<br>think about what they want to do<br>set their goals and really stick to it<br>particularly i think for students if<br>they're able to gain experience<br>throughout their degree whether that be<br>volunteer work in an area that they're<br>really passionate about for example you<br>might have been a captain of a sports<br>team you might be involved in your<br>religious organisation or another area<br>of the community these are things we<br>love hearing about because they show<br>leadership and community involvement in<br>teamwork<br>actually finding out a bit about that<br>candidate so some passion some<br>enthusiasm really kind of finding about<br>why they want to work for you and how<br>that relates to their studies<br>application that demonstrates who the<br>person is so not just what skills they<br>have who they are as a person and what<br>they can bring to our team convey your<br>passion for a topic or a subject through<br>what you're applying for when you see<br>thousands and thousands of cvs i like<br>one that looks good because it implies<br>that you are also a sharp candidate<br>making sure it's concise making sure you<br>talks to what the role itself looks for<br>and kind of demonstrating the passions<br>that they're looking for in those roles<br>goes a long way to kind of separate<br>might not necessarily have the technical<br>skills that we need but those<br>interpersonal skills are actually really<br>important we really look for critical<br>thinking good emotional intelligence if<br>you're looking at some of our careers<br>and our investigations or intelligence<br>areas then good data analysis skills<br>adaptability is really important<br>particularly in today's world whether<br>it's government or private chances are<br>things will change we want people to<br>grow in their role and develop critical<br>thinking and problem solving and just<br>had ability to fit in with our team data<br>science skills i think you'll find<br>within the science space everything is<br>moving into a science and coding area so<br>a lot of things that maybe were done<br>manually sometimes they're being<br>automated so i definitely highlight<br>those skills if you have them if you've<br>got a particular network or presence it<br>shows that you've been exposed to that<br>particular industry so i think that's a<br>really clear advantage and i think even<br>if you think it's a trivial thing i<br>think it's worth highlighting that in<br>your cover letter and cv statistics data<br>analysis and also writing skills to have<br>the ability to write really good<br>publications and different reports</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
