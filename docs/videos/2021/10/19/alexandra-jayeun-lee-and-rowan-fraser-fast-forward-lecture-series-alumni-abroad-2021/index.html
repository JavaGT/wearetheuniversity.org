auspices of which, with Elizabeth<br>Aitkin-Rose, I have organised the Spring series<br>of Fast Forward with the theme ‘Alumni Abroad’.<br>Many thanks once again to GIB for their support<br>of Fast Forward.<br>In the current series, we’ve so far talked<br>to Mark Wigley, Professor and Dean Emeritus<br>at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning<br>and Preservation at Columbia University, New<br>York; Elizabeth Farrelly, Writer and Opinion<br>Columnist with the Sydney Morning Herald;<br>Jude Kohlhase, Senior Urban Development Specialist<br>in the Asian Development Bank in Manila; and<br>Brendan MacFarlane, Director of Jakob + MacFarlane<br>Architects Paris.<br>In the fifth and final of these online Q&amp;As<br>for this season, we shift our focus to a younger<br>generation.<br>Many of our more recent architecture graduates<br>are making careers in disciplines other than<br>architecture.<br>Today I am talking to two such graduates,<br>who share interests in sustainability and<br>humanity but are working in very different<br>environments.<br>Dr Alexandra Jayeun Lee and Rowan Fraser.<br>Alex is the principal UX manager at Microsoft’s<br>Digital Transformation Platform Group.<br>Based in Seattle, Alex works with clients<br>worldwide to innovate, design, research and<br>launch services and products.<br>Previously, she cofounded the Civic Design<br>Lab, a California-based civic policy incubator,<br>as well as establishing local chapters of<br>Architecture for Humanity and Habitat for<br>Humanity.<br>Rowan currently leads the Laos country office<br>of GGGI, a global non-profit climate organisation<br>implementing a portfolio of low carbon investment<br>projects and public policy initiatives in<br>energy, waste and transport sectors.<br>Prior to this, Rowan led the Nepal country<br>office of GGGI, and earlier worked with the<br>United Nations on sustainable urban development<br>across Asia.<br>So welcome, Alex and Rowan, and thank you<br>so much for joining us today.<br>Thanks, Julia.<br>It’s great to be here.<br>Great.<br>Hi.<br>Hi, Alex.<br>Hello.<br>Alrighty, so we’ll get to where you are<br>now, but for starters, I’d like you to tell<br>us a little bit about where you grew up and<br>what influenced your decision to study architecture,<br>if there were any particular formative experiences<br>in there.<br>Alex, would you like to go first?<br>It seems like such a long time ago, Julia.<br>I grew up in West Auckland, between Massey<br>and Hobsonville.<br>I would say growing up I’ve always really<br>enjoyed creative arts and science equally,<br>so I decided to apply to architecture school<br>as a backup for if I don’t get into med<br>school.<br>But I think I’ve definitely made the right<br>choice in studying architecture, so here we<br>are.<br>Rowan?<br>Firstly, thanks, Julia, for this opportunity<br>and thanks also to the University of Auckland.<br>It’s really nice to reconnect after a few<br>years out of the school, so yeah, thanks for<br>this opportunity.<br>From my side, I grew up in Hawke’s Bay,<br>and I studied Graphics in high school.<br>I don’t know if that’s still a subject<br>that people study, but essentially it was<br>just like technical drawing, and I really<br>liked the precision of it.<br>The pencils and the rulers and the precision.<br>Then I liked that you basically just got to<br>spend time making things look good.<br>That was also really enjoyable.<br>I think there was an element — it seemed<br>like a respectable profession, you know what<br>I mean?<br>It seemed like something worth studying, and<br>so I think that was an element as well, maybe<br>like slight social mobility as well for me.<br>So, it was a combination, and that was my<br>initial push to take what I was learning in<br>Graphics as a 15 year old and then applying<br>for architecture school.<br>Great, thank you.<br>So Alex, you completed your BArch year in<br>2006, and Rowan you were in one of the first<br>cohorts after the change to MArch (Prof),<br>completing in 2009, so I’m interested to<br>hear some of your key memories of architecture<br>school from those times, or your experience<br>of the school, or any particular courses or<br>projects that struck you.<br>Rowan?<br>Lots of late nights.<br>That’s definitely a perennial memory.<br>You know, coming out of the computer labs<br>at 4 am in the morning as you’re preparing<br>for the upcoming crits and things, so I think<br>that’s a lot of very hard work, but very<br>enjoyable.<br>I mean, I really enjoyed the long design studio<br>sessions with classmates and stuff.<br>I think working on joint projects, as well.<br>That was really enjoyable, engaging with the<br>team to prepare designs.<br>Then some of Judy Cochrane’s work.<br>Funnily enough, I don’t think I really realised<br>it at the time, and I’m not sure if Judy<br>is still at the school—<br>No, she’s not.<br>She’s not?<br>Okay, she had this course.<br>You probably remember it, Julia.<br>She had this course on Second Life.<br>This was back in 2004 or something like this,<br>it was quite a while back.<br>She was doing this architecture project in<br>Second Life.<br>I think part of why it’s a recurring memory<br>is because it blew my mind that we could think<br>about architecture in this way, and I think<br>this was maybe second year of architecture.<br>For me, building architectural spaces in Second<br>Life was — I don’t know, for whatever<br>reason it really stuck with me.<br>Then the Renaissance work as well.<br>I really enjoyed the Renaissance architecture<br>history and theory lectures as well, so a<br>bit of a mix.<br>Yeah, quite different experiences there.<br>I can confirm that students are not in the<br>building at 4 o’clock in the morning any<br>longer.<br>Aren’t they?<br>Health and Safety regulations have had an<br>impact on that.<br>Oh, really?<br>Okay.<br>What about you, Alex?<br>I would say I was fortunate, or unfortunate,<br>to attend the architecture school when we<br>had the 24 hour access, and so just a few<br>years earlier, and maybe we ruined it for<br>the rest of you because we were so naughty<br>but definitely pulling the all-nighters—<br>Great.<br>—for the design studios, and putting our<br>finishing touches on your models leading up<br>to the crit.<br>I think I quickly realised, I think in my<br>second or third year, that I’m just not<br>very productive early in the morning and it<br>was not a sustainable way to be a uni student,<br>and so I decided to become much more organised.<br>You know, still turn in my projects in on<br>time, but then I had to finalise my ideas,<br>lock it in a few weeks before my peers, and<br>so that was the trade-off that I made, but<br>I don’t regret it.<br>I still don’t do all-nighters and try to<br>stay away from those kind of things.<br>In terms of classes, I definitely really enjoyed<br>all the classes offered by Sarah Treadwell.<br>I don’t know if she’s still around.<br>Retired.<br>Retired?<br>Retired.<br>Yeah, that surprises me.<br>I always think like Sarah has another 50 years<br>in her because she just brought so much energy<br>and positivity in all of her classes.<br>She was such a great speaker and the way that<br>she described different aspects of appreciating<br>the shapes and forms and history of architecture,<br>and vernacular architecture really struck<br>with me, and I really enjoyed her watercolour<br>classes.<br>I would say another class that I really enjoyed<br>was the late Garry Tonks.<br>I mean, he passed away a while ago but his<br>construction structure classes, I know they<br>were probably too boring for the vast majority<br>of folks.<br>But his classes and the lessons, you know<br>around the four D’s of weather tightness,<br>they still apply.<br>Now that I own a home and do reno projects,<br>that’s the first thing I think of.<br>Drain, Deflect, Dry — okay, well I give<br>up on the last D, but it was very memorable,<br>and I loved both the creative side and the<br>practical side of architecture school.<br>I really loved my time there.<br>Great, it’s good to hear it.<br>Positive promotion of construction technology<br>courses, thank you.<br>So, after your respective professional programmes,<br>you both completed higher degrees, with Alex<br>completing a PhD here in 2014, and Rowan you<br>did an MA in French here in Auckland and then<br>a Master of Urban Policy in Paris.<br>So Alex, what influenced your decision to<br>do a PhD?<br>Tell us a little about your thesis.<br>Gosh, I would say the main thing that really<br>propelled me to pursue a graduate degree,<br>or PhD specifically, was while I was running<br>Architecture for Humanity’s Auckland chapter,<br>which is essentially a service design non-profit<br>that was established in New Zealand and ran<br>for about a decade while I was there.<br>I had this very deep desire to understand<br>why things were the way they are and for this<br>non-profit, a lot of the work that we did<br>were to help with low income communities responding<br>after storms, cyclones and natural disasters,<br>and just seeing a lot of suffering as part<br>of that job.<br>I really had this existential moment where<br>I really wanted to learn more deeply about<br>this field of disaster risk management and<br>prevention.<br>I was also teaching seminars on humanitarian<br>design, and I also just really wanted to learn<br>from other ages and experts in the area and<br>pursuing a postgraduate degree was a really<br>nice way to wrap it in to bridge my deep love<br>for learning and meeting the best people in<br>the world that are doing that work.<br>Great, and Rowan, what influenced your decision<br>to do first the MA in French and then to head<br>to Paris to do the Master of Urban Policy?<br>Sometimes I ask myself that as well, Julia.<br>I think part of it was I had this idea that<br>university should be more than just a job.<br>I liked the idea that you could go to university<br>and expand your mind and pursue learning for<br>the love of learning, I guess.<br>I decided to do an MA to extend some of the<br>themes and topics that I had enjoyed in architecture.<br>I’m not sure how useful it was.<br>I mean, it was useful of course, but from<br>a professional perspective, I guess.<br>I was just really curious, so I think it was<br>just curiosity really, which was driving the<br>MA.<br>I loved it.<br>I really enjoyed it.<br>Just studying French literature and getting<br>to spend a lot of time in these fictional<br>worlds.<br>Primarily it was around doing something which<br>wasn’t really related to a professional<br>career, basically.<br>It was something for the love of it.<br>Then the Urban Policy Masters in Paris was<br>motivated by a desire to understand some of<br>the invisible sides to cities.<br>I felt like through the architecture degree,<br>I had a pretty good grasp of the material<br>design elements of cities, the buildings.<br>As I was going through my Master’s in Architecture,<br>I realised that my primary interest was not<br>really in producing architecture, but in working<br>on cities as systems.<br>So, I obviously looked at the urban planning<br>course, which was a few floors above us in<br>the architecture school, and spoke to a few<br>people there, but then ultimately went for<br>this course in France.<br>So, primarily it was around trying to understand<br>the economics, the politics of cities.<br>The sociology of cities, you know?<br>All of these other elements that are really<br>important in terms of how a city functions.<br>I think part of it was also just keen for<br>a change of scene, right?<br>I’d done three degrees at the University<br>of Auckland at that point.<br>I’d done a Bachelors, I’d done a Master<br>of Architecture, an MA and loved it all, had<br>a fantastic time, a wonderful experience.<br>But yeah, I was just keen to get overseas<br>and try something a bit different as well.<br>So that was it, really.<br>You must’ve been fluent in French to have<br>done firstly the MA—<br>Kind of, yeah.<br>—and then presumably your course was taught<br>in French, was it?<br>Yeah, the course in Paris was taught in French,<br>and so I had like conversational level French.<br>I could chat and things, but it was a real<br>struggle.<br>It was a really intense struggle because I<br>was going from conversational French to academic<br>French, Masters-level academic French.<br>I think I hadn’t really appreciated the<br>difference between the English that you use<br>with your family when you’re having dinner<br>versus the English that you use when you’re<br>writing an essay.<br>So, I was trying to get up to that masters-level<br>French, academic-level French, and that was<br>pretty tough but it was worth it.<br>A good step up.<br>So, talk us through your various steps from<br>there through to where you are now.<br>Rowan first.<br>So, as part of the Master’s in Urban Policy<br>in Paris, I had to do an internship.<br>I didn’t really want to do one, but we were<br>obliged to do one as the last semester in<br>a four semester course.<br>So, I applied to a bunch of different organisations,<br>including a regional body of the UN in Bangkok<br>which manages Asia/Pacific policy harmonisation<br>and dialogue, and I was accepted there.<br>I was super excited.<br>This was like 2011.<br>We were on the tail end of the Financial Crisis.<br>I was 27, in Europe, and for my age bracket<br>I think unemployment was like 37% or something<br>horrendous, and so I was clear that I didn’t<br>want to be in Europe.<br>I felt like I needed to go somewhere where<br>there were more opportunities for somebody<br>that was young and trying to break into the<br>workforce.<br>So, I did the internship in Asia, had a fantastic<br>time, and then basically worked with a few<br>different NGOs on urban development issues.<br>I was doing a lot of critical infrastructure<br>and risk management, flood risk management,<br>a lot of disaster risk reduction, like some<br>of those things that Alex was mentioning,<br>for a few NGOs and then some private planning<br>firms as well, a few different UN agencies.<br>Then went back to the UN to work on a big<br>waste management project, so was with the<br>UN for another two years and then consulted<br>a bit further.<br>I was hustling.<br>You know, I had $35,000 of debt, I was keen<br>to build skills and pay off debt, so I was<br>just taking any job I could really.<br>Bit by bit just built my career and then I<br>joined GGI after those two years with the<br>UN, so that was just over four years back.<br>Then spent four years in Kathmandu with GGGI.<br>A few too many G’s.<br>A lot of people kind of get caught up on the<br>number of G’s there.<br>Then joined the team here in Laos about six<br>weeks back.<br>Great, thank you.<br>Alex, how about your steps from PhD to where<br>you are now?<br>Oh boy.<br>Well, right after I handed in my dissertation,<br>I moved to the West Coast of California to<br>effectively turn my dissertation into a book<br>by pursuing a postdoc at the UC Berkley’s,<br>at the time, Centre for Social Change, and<br>then subsequently at the Centre for Environmental<br>Design.<br>I luckily had some connections with professors<br>from doing the EAP programme, the Exchange<br>Abroad in my fourth year of the architecture<br>school.<br>So, I went there to really turn my dissertation<br>into a book because what good is a dissertation<br>if it’s going to be collecting dust on someone’s<br>shelf?<br>I pursued a lot of publishers, got a ton of<br>rejections along the way, so I would say the<br>rejections were really, really great character<br>forming experiences and I encourage everybody<br>listening to go and get rejected a lot because<br>it helps you grow and helps you be humble<br>and think about different opportunities.<br>I don’t think I would be where I am if I<br>weren’t rejected so much in my formative<br>years.<br>As a result of also being in the Silicon Valley,<br>I would say anyone with a math degree becomes<br>a data scientist and anybody with a design<br>degree becomes a user experience designer,<br>which is field of design within technology<br>that’s dedicated to understanding people,<br>particularly around how they use products,<br>whether it’s digital or physical.<br>As someone with a foundation in architecture<br>I had the physical down, but really thinking<br>about how do we really look at the skills<br>that you hone in your undergraduate programmes,<br>and specifically the architecture school,<br>I had leveraged a lot of those in terms of<br>spatial reasoning, but also systems thinking.<br>A lot of the way that we design and build<br>and learn about those tactics and strategies,<br>I think, are really transferable to many different<br>disciplines outside of architecture.<br>I would also say that a lot of my experience,<br>again lots of rejections and no’s, while<br>running a non-profit organisation were really<br>great at setting the foundation for like being<br>a hustler, as Rowan mentioned.<br>You just learn to grow a thicker skin and<br>you really don’t have a path that you’re<br>following specifically.<br>When you’re creating your own path, you<br>learn to really talk about things that you<br>know in a way that’s easily understandable<br>to others and also translating a lot of what<br>you learn and applying it in new ways.<br>As the classic argument goes, there are no<br>new ideas, but only application of those in<br>new places and contexts, and so I would say<br>that those kinds of ideas and experiences<br>help lead me to projects.<br>I work with a lot of start-ups, non-profits,<br>and as I was learning to apply all the skills<br>that I’ve learned hitherto into UX led me<br>to an opportunity to co-found a lab for the<br>local government called Civic Design Lab,<br>which was really about teaching people how<br>to think like a designer.<br>Can you imagine, going into local government?<br>I think Auckland Council does this really<br>well, from what I know, is like how to teach<br>people about design.<br>One of the more formative books that I read<br>earlier during my student days was called<br>Cradle to Cradle by William McDonough and<br>co.<br>In that book, he opens with the statement<br>that ‘Design is the first signal of human<br>intention.’<br>That really struck with me and it made me<br>realise we can’t afford to not have everybody<br>be a designer, especially in the 21st Century,<br>with all the complex, ambiguous — you know,<br>this age of climate change, we all need to<br>be come designers.<br>I think through school we usually get that<br>beaten out of us, when you’re not the best<br>designer in your class.<br>I do have this dream of dedicating my life<br>and career to democratising design for everybody.<br>It is a 30 year goal and I would say I’m<br>about halfway there.<br>I’m still figuring things out and learning<br>along the way, but that’s what really drives<br>me, is this dedication to really want to share<br>all the greatness that being a designer and<br>having that creative mindset really brings<br>to any situation and challenges and the decisions<br>that we all have to make along the way.<br>So, how long have you been at Microsoft?<br>I joined Microsoft in the summer of 2019,<br>so I’ve been here for just over two and<br>a half years.<br>So, can you tell us just a little bit more<br>about what you do in your current role?<br>Yeah, so I am a research manager of user experience<br>at Microsoft.<br>So even though I work for Microsoft, I’m<br>speaking today in a personal capacity, of<br>course, with that caveat.<br>I would say that the part of Microsoft that<br>really enables digital transformation of any<br>organisations or businesses of any size to<br>help them achieve more with less, and so this<br>is kind of a similar paradigm to what I was<br>pursuing when I was co-leading Architecture<br>for Humanity.<br>When resources are scarce, how do we think<br>creatively and really deliver more to our<br>community with what we have, resources that<br>we have, and how do we make that scale?<br>This is a similar application of that, but<br>in the digital domain, where my main job is<br>to figure out what kind of research needs<br>to be done to help all the stakeholders, people<br>in the company make better decisions.<br>I think that’s the simplest way of removing<br>technical jargon of what I actually do, but<br>it really comes down to helping folks understand<br>human behaviour, habits, and attitudes people<br>have around products that they use, which<br>is global.<br>Great, thanks.<br>How about you, Rowan?<br>A little bit more about what you’re actually<br>doing in your current role, knowing that you’re<br>very new there?<br>Well, that’s a similar role to the role<br>that I had in Nepal, but with a bigger team<br>and a more complex portfolio.<br>I mean, as an organisation we support primarily<br>government clients to develop climate change<br>solutions to challenges that they’re facing.<br>These might be policy solutions.<br>We might be building out new policy to tackle<br>particular issues.<br>For example, we’re working on a piece of<br>policy here around greening industry.<br>So, there are many special economic zones<br>and industrial areas that Laos is developing<br>as an economic goal, and we’re working with<br>government partners on finding ways to reduce<br>the pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,<br>improve energy efficiency etc, in industrial<br>areas.<br>That’s through a policy instrument.<br>We’re designing out of a policy instrument<br>to tackle some of these challenges.<br>Then, we also do a lot of investment and infrastructure<br>work.<br>So here we would be again working with government<br>partners primarily to design, develop and<br>construct, and sometimes operate, pieces of<br>infrastructure that solve climate change challenges.<br>We’re doing a lot of waste management work,<br>where we’re building out, for example, essentially<br>composting facilities.<br>Massive, municipal-level composting facilities,<br>so you’re pulling in all the organic waste<br>from the city, instead of it going into landfill<br>where there’s a lot of methane that’s<br>produced as it decomposes inorganically, you’re<br>composting it.<br>We’re also working on actual methane capture<br>solutions as well, where you can produce biogas<br>out of the organic waste.<br>These are pieces of infrastructure.<br>Not quite the size as — I know that you<br>spoke to colleagues from ADB, I think Jude,<br>earlier in the series.<br>The Development Banks are operating at a scale<br>which is higher than GGGI, so just managing<br>much bigger pieces of infrastructure.<br>We tend to work more on stuff between, say,<br>20 and 100 million dollars in terms of infrastructure<br>size.<br>It’s a combination of policy and infrastructure,<br>and we work across multiple sectors; waste,<br>sanitation, agriculture, forestry, energy,<br>and a few others, and try to provide these<br>various technical advisory services to government<br>clients.<br>In terms of my role, it’s really overseeing<br>the portfolio and there’s not as much technical<br>work as I would like.<br>The role has also quite a bit of relationship<br>and stakeholder management, there’s a fair<br>amount of budget management as well.<br>I do get to engage on some of the technical<br>elements of the projects, and as somebody<br>with an urban background, my interest is primarily<br>on some of the waste and transport projects.<br>We’re doing a lot of electric mobility work,<br>for example.<br>It’s great, and I really enjoy the organisation<br>and enjoy the work that we’re able to do<br>with government partners.<br>Of course, there are many challenges as well.<br>I’ve been working on climate change now<br>in Asia for about 10 years more or less, and<br>it’s been interesting to see also the arc<br>of the way that governments treat the issue.<br>Certainly over the past two or three years,<br>there’s been a pretty big shift in terms<br>of how — I think how governments globally,<br>but certainly in terms of governments here<br>in Asia, how they’re dealing with climate<br>change.<br>2012, I’d sit down with government partners<br>and they didn’t really care.<br>Often they didn’t really care, but I think<br>there’s a lot more enthusiasm and also just<br>recognition of the urgency of the issue and<br>the need to put real resources into finding<br>tangible solutions to climate change.<br>Yeah, you’ve got to assume there has to<br>be a lot more awareness than there was 10<br>or so years ago.<br>So I’m interested, for both of you, when<br>you first made that move overseas, if you<br>had much of a plan or if it felt risky?<br>If it was nervous about heading off?<br>How much of a plan did you have?<br>Rowan?<br>I didn’t have much of a plan.<br>I was more or less just winging it, whether<br>that’s a good thing or a bad thing, I’m<br>not sure.<br>It did feel risky.<br>I mean, I guess for me the definitive, so<br>to speak, shift out of New Zealand came after<br>I completed the Master’s in Architecture<br>and then went off for the Master’s in Urban<br>Policy in Paris.<br>I had travelled a little bit before that,<br>but I think that was the moment when I shifted,<br>so to speak.<br>I didn’t have a long term plan.<br>I guess I was just really curious and interested<br>to see the world and wanted to explore, really.<br>I think one thing that I’ve learned, it<br>seems — I remember I was in the Kate Edgers<br>Building in Auckland, preparing – is that<br>what it’s called?<br>The Kate Edgers Building?<br>Yeah right – preparing my application for<br>the university in Paris, and it just seemed<br>so momentous to uproot my life and go and<br>study overseas.<br>I was a little terrified of that.<br>Then, the more I’ve done it from various<br>countries, the more I realise how easy it<br>is, actually.<br>Yeah, okay, you need to find accommodation<br>and work out where you can buy water and milk<br>and whatever, but it’s actually relatively<br>straightforward.<br>I was expecting that it would be more difficult.<br>I think in my head it was more difficult than<br>it was.<br>So, I definitely encourage anybody, students,<br>that are thinking of going and working internationally,<br>to really just go ahead and do it.<br>It’s easier than we think.<br>Of course, there are many challenges.<br>I’m not saying it’s like a walk in the<br>park, but certainly for me it seemed like<br>a more momentous and a more challenging shift<br>than it actually was.<br>How about you, Alex?<br>Did you have much of a plan or were you winging<br>it, as well?<br>I would say so.<br>I would say I wasn’t as scared because I<br>had already emigrated to New Zealand with<br>my parents.<br>I was 10, and this was my second emigration,<br>I guess, to the US and so it felt familiar.<br>I was going back to the school where I had<br>done the exchange programme in, so there was<br>a little bit of familiarity.<br>To be completely transparent, one of my goals<br>was to actually get a job as a professor,<br>because the options are limited in New Zealand.<br>Also, to Rowan’s point, I got a ton of rejections<br>and you just figure out how to roll with it.<br>I quickly realised being a professor in a<br>country that I haven’t practiced in the<br>field of architecture is a little more challenging,<br>and so I would actually make it to the final<br>round in every job that I applied for and<br>then I would get a rejection because they<br>would say they loved me, but I just don’t<br>have enough local experience to teach the<br>kids locally, and so that totally made sense<br>and it felt like I would be starting from<br>scratch in some ways.<br>That’s when I decided to pivot my career,<br>with all the same skills that I had learned<br>and were transferable outside of the industry.<br>That’s great, thank you.<br>So Alex, I know that you’ve also married<br>and had a child while you’ve been in the<br>States, so how is Microsoft as a family friendly<br>employer?<br>I mean, I would say it depends on who you<br>talk to.<br>I would say Microsoft is one of the most family<br>friendly employers in the States, but they<br>still don’t hold a candle to family friendly<br>work environments that New Zealand employers<br>provide.<br>I think New Zealand is many, many decades<br>and generations ahead compared to other OECD<br>countries when it comes to human rights and<br>standing up for the right things and sustainability.<br>I do feel incredibly fortunate to have spent<br>the COVID pandemic at Microsoft, because I<br>was one of the 40% of the workforce that was<br>fortunate enough to work 100% remotely through<br>the past year and a half, and so I am very<br>grateful to the company for supporting that.<br>It was also very eye-opening to see how there<br>isn’t enough support for young families,<br>when it comes down to it.<br>There is really not enough systems in place<br>for social safety nets.<br>Many folks here are just one pay check away<br>from homelessness, and that breaks my heart<br>every day to know that I’ve made a choice<br>to work in this sector, but folks that didn’t<br>make that choice are also suffering as a result,<br>and so I just feel like there is a lot of<br>injustice in that and wish there was more<br>we could do.<br>How about you, Rowan, in that space?<br>You’ve met your wife out there in the world<br>and have you guys got kids?<br>No, not yet.<br>Not yet.<br>I’m keen but my wife’s like, ‘Let’s<br>give it a couple of years,’ so I’m waiting.<br>We met in Bangkok and so we were there for<br>five years and then got married in Bangkok,<br>and then shifted out to Nepal and then came<br>here.<br>My wife, she’s from Colombia, we were working<br>together.<br>She’s an economist, so she does a lot of<br>online work and does a lot of data science<br>as well with some of the UN agencies.<br>No kids as yet.<br>Nothing that I can really comment on with<br>that.<br>I mean, as an organisation there’s quite<br>a lot of support in terms of parental leave<br>and things, but I haven’t gone down that<br>track yet myself.<br>When you both think of where you’re up to<br>in your career now, how do you think of what<br>you’re doing in relation to architecture,<br>or what aspects of the architecture degree<br>might have helped you to get where you are?<br>Alex, you touched on that a little bit before,<br>but I just wondered if there was anything<br>that you’d add to the specific question?<br>Rowan, would you like to comment on that one?<br>Sorry, I thought we were — okay, yes, and<br>very cute dog, Alex, by the way.<br>I think there are definitely a few elements<br>that I feel like I learned, or that I honed<br>maybe, during architecture and which I use<br>consistently.<br>I think one is creative problem solving.<br>I think so much of the work that I do, and<br>I suspect that so much of the work that a<br>lot of people do, is around finding solutions<br>to problems, right?<br>In whatever sector.<br>I think one of the things that a degree in<br>architecture gives you is a process for addressing<br>a set of contextual issues, i.e. kind of the<br>site and working through a brief, so there<br>are design parameters there, constraints that<br>you have to consider.<br>Then coming up with a set of solutions or<br>a set of concepts, and then you work through<br>those.<br>You reject 90% of them and move forward with<br>10%.<br>I think that process, I found that very, very<br>valuable and I use that day in, day out with<br>the work that I do and the teams that I work<br>with.<br>So, I think creative problem solving’s been<br>really, really valuable.<br>I think also brainstorming.<br>I remember one of the first times that a colleague<br>said to me that I have a lot of ideas.<br>Not necessarily good ideas, but just a lot<br>of ideas.<br>Some are good, some are bad, and I had never<br>really thought of that as a strength.<br>Then as I’ve gone deeper into my career,<br>I realised that it is a strength and having<br>somebody on the team who can just spit out<br>ideas – whether they work or not, that’s<br>the second stage, then you have to assess<br>them and work out if they’re viable – is<br>a really valuable contribution.<br>I think again architecture is really good<br>at that, because we spend so much time as<br>students in the design studio and for our<br>other assignments we kept coming up with ideas<br>and just being really comfortable to brainstorm<br>and chuck out ideas.<br>Being examined on them, as well.<br>I mean, the crit process was intense.<br>I’m not sure if it’s still intense.<br>Maybe they are with Healthy and Safety — it’s<br>still intense, right?<br>But that’s also extremely valuable, because<br>you learn to defend without being defensive<br>necessarily, but rationalise and provide explanation.<br>There’s a lot of engagement with ideas,<br>and I think that’s extremely valuable.<br>Then of course, the work ethic.<br>I think architecture school definitely gave<br>me a work ethic which I still carry.<br>I suspect that if students don’t have 24<br>hour access to the building, they’re probably<br>still just working from their laptops at home<br>or something, pulling all-nighters when necessary,<br>but certainly the work ethic.<br>I think that’s also been really valuable.<br>Those would be a few of the points, I think,<br>that I utilise day to day.<br>Great, thank you.<br>Alex, did you have anything to add to that<br>one about things from your architecture degree<br>that are relevant in your current role or<br>in your career development?<br>Yeah, definitely.<br>I mean, I would say all of the above and what<br>I mentioned a little bit earlier about the<br>architecture degree being really like a great<br>foundation for other types of opportunities<br>and careers.<br>I think it’s just really great at helping<br>us think about things more systemically, in<br>terms of layers, planned section elevations<br>or daily critical thinking around three dimensional<br>spaces, how people interact with them and<br>how to best apply those principles in different<br>contexts is really like what gave me strength<br>to continue when there were no answers.<br>The current state of the world we live in,<br>that’s commonly referred as a VUCA world;<br>Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous.<br>It’s never been more important to think<br>about the consequences of the actions and<br>decisions, and I think as architects, or architectural<br>students, we often have to make those decisions<br>more often than would someone working in two<br>dimensional space or any other industry, I<br>think.<br>It helps us think more clearly but also at<br>different altitudes.<br>It pushes us to think beyond our own realm<br>and the world, but also helps us think about<br>others, and so it’s a great way to build<br>empathy, just by virtue of designing for a<br>purpose and specific contexts.<br>I found those daily inspirations and ways<br>to really double down on the fundamental skills<br>that you learn as an architectural graduate.<br>Alex, do you have any thoughts or tips on<br>engaging with the US tech companies?<br>For somebody who’s thinking about shifting<br>to the US, how do you get a foot in the door<br>into that world?<br>In the US more broadly, I would say one thing<br>that really struck me coming here is just<br>how great people are at selling themselves,<br>really putting themselves forward.<br>Being raised and growing up in a culture,<br>you know, the tall poppy syndrome, like you<br>really don’t want to stick out because your<br>neck will get cut off if you stick out too<br>much, and you’re just staying humble and<br>being kind to each other.<br>Those kinds of values, like the commonwealth,<br>I think can become a stigma when you’re<br>really hustling and really getting out there<br>in the American context.<br>I would say there’s so many opportunities<br>in tech, like currently we’re facing a 50-100<br>million shortfall in skilled workers in IT.<br>The products that we’re building at Microsoft<br>are ways to help bridge that gap or assuage<br>this backlog of work that we need to help<br>businesses transform and adopt more of a digital<br>business model, which also as it turns out<br>has been really critical during COVID times.<br>So, there’s a plethora of opportunities<br>in tech as well with folks with a design background.<br>I often mentor folks from the field too, and<br>there are tons of former architectural graduates<br>and architects who have become US designers<br>successfully.<br>Thanks for that.<br>Rowan, how about you?<br>Any thoughts or tips on how to get into UN<br>or NGO work or agencies in Asia?<br>I sometimes get students or alumni reaching<br>out and I’m happy if there are people in<br>the audience who want any additional thoughts<br>or feedback or ideas, I’m happy to have<br>those conversations.<br>I mean, some of the points that I often suggest,<br>there’s one around networking.<br>I think I really underutilised that when I<br>was trying to break into the international<br>development sector, and LinkedIn is just such<br>a resource.<br>I always felt very awkward about networking,<br>but I think even if you don’t call it ‘networking’.<br>You’re just reaching out to people and with<br>a genuine curiosity about the work that they<br>do and the organisations that they work for<br>and the projects that they’re on.<br>I think people are pretty open to talking<br>about what they do, and in general, quite<br>responsive.<br>So, I would really encourage people to reach<br>out to folks.<br>If they’re particularly interested in the<br>sector, send the contact a request and open<br>a message box and just express your interest.<br>I think that’s a really valuable way to<br>build in that work and get engaged a bit.<br>I also think having some type of technical<br>skillset that you’re offering, and maybe<br>this also kind of goes to what Alex was saying<br>but having something that you can pitch is<br>useful.<br>Sometimes I get people reaching out, interested<br>in positions with the organisation that I<br>work for, and in my field it’s the broad<br>environmentalists or they have a degree in<br>environmental science, so that’s very broad.<br>Sometimes it’s hard for me to then work<br>out how I could position that person within<br>the team, because there’s no clear area<br>that they work in.<br>So, I think having a sense of what you bring<br>to a team and being able to articulate that<br>value addition when you’re reaching out<br>is useful to people that you’re reaching<br>out to, because it just makes it easier for<br>us to then think how to engage with the person.<br>Then, maybe one other point would just be<br>articulating what you’re doing as bringing<br>value to the team.<br>Often I get approached and people are talking<br>about how if they can get a job with my organisation,<br>it will benefit them.<br>Their career will expand and it’s useful<br>for them and their learning and their development.<br>Of course, that’s nice but as somebody who’s<br>in the organisation, I’m most interested<br>in how this person might bring value to my<br>organisation, or the team, or the projects<br>that we work on.<br>I think also just thinking about it from how<br>we can add value to organisations is maybe<br>useful, so those would be some initial thoughts.<br>I would add to what Rowan said, yes, it’s<br>definitely helpful to be able to market yourself<br>and the skills that somebody’s willing to<br>pay for.<br>I think the other side of it is also just<br>knowing yourself and what you want, because<br>often people see job applications and interviews<br>as a very one-sided way to get evaluated by<br>someone who has no idea what you do or who<br>you are.<br>It’s also a really great opportunity, and<br>this is something I tell all of my mentees,<br>is treat every interview as an opportunity<br>to learn more about the team and the projects<br>and the company that you’re at.<br>Of course, do your due diligence and research<br>and learn about the company, be proactive<br>and ask a lot of questions because asking<br>good questions is a really, also from a hiring<br>manager’s perspective, good signal that<br>they’re paying attention and they care about<br>the workplace and they’re likely to be a<br>go-getter.<br>That’s really what we’re all wanting as<br>employers, is to not only have a marketable<br>skill, but the resilience and tenacity to<br>keep going when you’re up against challenges,<br>and there’s no better kind of barometer<br>for success than that.<br>We want the go-getters, too.<br>There’s a couple more requests for advice<br>that are sitting in the Q&amp;A, and one of them<br>is, ‘Any tips for architecture students<br>wanting to head down a particularly sustainability<br>pathway?’<br>If there’s any advice that you’d give?<br>From my side or from Alex’s side, you mean?<br>Either, both.<br>Either side, okay.<br>I think the transition from architecture into<br>broader sustainability maybe passes through<br>different areas; energy, efficiency in buildings.<br>I remember when I was at architecture school<br>there was a lot of focus on the passive house<br>movement coming out of Germany and things<br>like this.<br>So, I guess these looking at buildings as<br>systems in the sense that there’s also waste<br>being generated through — there’s all<br>of the materials.<br>The sustainability of the actual building<br>materials.<br>I think getting into some of those areas within<br>architecture can allow somebody to transition<br>into sustainability more broadly.<br>I think also certification.<br>There’s a lot of sustainability certification<br>which is emerging, and I think that could<br>also be a useful mechanism if you’re an<br>architecture graduate and looking to enter<br>sustainability, is to maybe also think about<br>your certification options, linking sustainability<br>in buildings to the broader sustainability<br>sector.<br>Thanks.<br>Anything to add there, Alex?<br>I mean, of course, as someone who is probably<br>doing nothing remotely close to architecture<br>on a day to day basis, I would say keep an<br>open mind.<br>Really challenge yourself into thinking about<br>what does sustainability mean to you.<br>Is it about carbon zero?<br>Carbon neutral?<br>All of the energy management side of things<br>or is it about supporting like a sustainable<br>business?<br>Is it more about sustaining culture?<br>There are so many different ways to think<br>about sustainability.<br>So, as you’re a student, I think one of<br>the most powerful things about being a student<br>is that everybody’s really open to giving<br>time to students, rather than someone who’s<br>a professional because they always think,<br>oh this person has some other agenda.<br>But when you approach someone as a student,<br>they always think, oh this person wants to<br>learn something and they’re curious about<br>my field or programme or whatever.<br>I would really think about what it means to<br>you, before you paint yourself into a corner<br>and say, ‘I’m only going to study sustainable<br>architecture and see what career options are<br>available to me.’<br>That’s certainly one really valid way to<br>do so, because there is this massive global<br>movement of trying to build in a more sustainable,<br>resilient manner.<br>As climate change is ramping up, we do definitely<br>need more help, all the help that we can get,<br>of people dedicated to carving out their career<br>in that path.<br>I would also say if that’s not your cup<br>of tea, if you start snoring as soon as you<br>start calculating your N values and sunshine<br>hours, I think there are alternatives to that<br>path, and I think you just have to keep an<br>open mind.<br>Great, thank you.<br>There’s another piece of advice that’s<br>sought, and that is for architecture students<br>who might be nearing the end of their degree,<br>but not know what they want to do next, whereas<br>some of their peers, they’ve got their plans<br>sorted.<br>What advice might you give to the people who<br>don’t have their plans sorted and are wondering<br>and worried, I guess, about what might happen<br>next?<br>I don’t have any advice because I always<br>know exactly what I want — no, I’m just<br>kidding.<br>Yeah, that’s a hard one, and it’s a hard<br>one because it is so personal.<br>You know, no answers from myself or Rowan<br>or Julia will really resonate with the student<br>if we told them to go this way and that way<br>is not where they want to go.<br>I think it’s okay to be uncertain.<br>I think it’s okay when you’re just graduating<br>to explore and jump around different types<br>of workplaces.<br>This is the time to learn, I would say in<br>your twenties is when you really want to stretch<br>yourself, take risks, fail, get rejected as<br>much as you want because that is the best<br>way for you to figure out what it is that<br>you want.<br>I would say having studied both in New Zealand<br>and the US, in the US the focus is more on<br>a general education, so that you become more<br>of a generalist first, before you pick a specialisation<br>and major in a subject, whereas in the Commonwealth<br>and New Zealand educational system, you have<br>to know what degree you’re going to get<br>on day one.<br>You don’t really get to look around and<br>explore and dabble in this department and<br>that department.<br>You can do that but it’s, as Rowan said,<br>very expensive getting three degrees before<br>you realise that you wanted to go study in<br>Paris.<br>I definitely don’t recommend that route,<br>but I mean, all the strengths to you if you<br>do want to pursue that, and I think that’s<br>a great way to build a career as successful<br>as Rowan has today.<br>I would just keep an open mind and as I said,<br>figure out who you are as a person, and also<br>figure out who you’re not, cos I think that’s<br>probably going to help expedite your career<br>and where you want to dedicate your time.<br>When you know what you don’t want perhaps<br>gives you more clarity on what will suffice<br>for the time being, but as a student I would<br>say the world is your oyster, so go out there<br>and party on.<br>How about you, Rowan?<br>Anything else for the person who’s not quite<br>sure what they’re doing?<br>Yeah, I agree with Alex.<br>I think I wouldn’t worry about it.<br>I think there’s a lot of pressure put on<br>us to have a sense of where we’re going<br>and what we want to do, and to find ourselves,<br>right?<br>There’s identity wrapped up with it.<br>I think it takes some people less time and<br>some people more time.<br>I feel like some people never really work<br>it out and that’s also okay.<br>You just do what you do, so I really wouldn’t<br>worry too much.<br>I think exploring, trying new stuff, as Alex<br>has suggested, and just seeing where it takes<br>you.<br>I think also there’s this misconception<br>sometimes that a career is planned or driven,<br>you know?<br>We’re in a car, driving our career.<br>I feel like half the time you’re just following<br>opportunities which come up on the horizon,<br>and then you get defined by that.<br>That it’s not as though you intended that<br>at the start.<br>So, I think also just seeing what comes up.<br>Yeah, party on, as Alex said.<br>Brilliant, okay.<br>My final question for both of you is, what<br>next?<br>What’s your plan from here, or do you not<br>have one?<br>Are you dependent on opportunities?<br>So, from my side, no real plan.<br>I guess that’s a recurring message that<br>I’m bringing.<br>There’s no real plan.<br>I mean, I will be in Nepal, my wife and I,<br>for another few years, and I’m a little<br>interested in the private sector, I have to<br>say.<br>I think doing sustainability in the private<br>sector could be interesting, so that’s maybe<br>something which is on my horizon a bit.<br>But beyond that, I’m just really focussed<br>on my current role and doing the work here.<br>Great, thank you, and Alex?<br>I don’t have much to add, other than I have<br>this philosophy that in every job that I’ve<br>ever held, I always think about how to design<br>myself out of it.<br>The goal is to really do the job well and<br>then train others to take over as soon as<br>it’s practical to do so.<br>It has never really failed me in knowing the<br>right time to step away and transition to<br>other roles, but as Rowan said, I keep an<br>open mind and it’s okay to not have a plan.<br>It’s interesting because I was also going<br>to add I came to Microsoft as kind of like<br>the final test, to see how the private sector<br>functions and how they make decisions and<br>as it regards to policy, there are so much<br>power in corporations these days.<br>But there’s also limited accountability<br>that is often presented to public sector,<br>so I think every industry actually has something<br>really different to offer and there’s an<br>opportunity for growth.<br>Brilliant, thank you both so much.<br>It’s been absolutely terrific talking to<br>you, and catching up with you both, and hearing<br>all the fabulous things that you’ve been<br>up to.<br>I hope you’ll come and see us in person<br>next time you’re in Auckland.<br>It’d be great to catch up in person.<br>Thank you again.<br>Thanks so much, Julia.<br>All the best.<br>Thanks, Alex.<br>Thank you.<br>Bye-bye.<br>Thanks, bye-bye.<br>All righty, so a reminder for the audience<br>that this was the fifth and final Zoom Q&amp;A<br>for Fast Forward Spring, and we were to have<br>had one in-person lecture at the tail end<br>of our series by our dean, Professor Diane<br>Brand.<br>That was to have been an in-person lecture,<br>firstly in October, then in November, but<br>the whole COVID thing is continuing to make<br>us nervous around big public events and so<br>we have decided to hold that event over until<br>next year, which will really mean a Fast Forward<br>series probably in March 2022.<br>The recordings of all of these Zoom Q&amp;As will<br>be posted on the Fast Forward website, probably<br>fairly soon now, so that’s www.fastforward.ac.nz,<br>and beyond that, thank you very much once<br>again to Alex and Rowan, and I bid you all<br>a fabulous day.<br>Thank you very much.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
