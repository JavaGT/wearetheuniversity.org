A Samoan New Zealander,<br>he has traversed the greater Pacific/Asia<br>region in education and in professional focus,<br>and he’s now a Senior Urban Development<br>Specialist in the Asian Development Bank.<br>The warmest welcome, Jude, and thank you so<br>much for joining us tonight.<br>So, before we get onto your reflections on<br>life in the now, I thought we might begin<br>at the beginning and your childhood, mostly<br>in Samoa, which is an idyllic Pacific paradise<br>to most of us, at least to prospective tourists.<br>Why don’t you tell us a wee bit about those<br>formative years?<br>Thank you, Elizabeth, and certainly thank<br>you to Professor Jennifer Dixon for today’s<br>event, and for identifying me to be involved<br>in this alumni discussion.<br>I really appreciate the opportunity. It’s<br>been going on 20 years since I left the University<br>of Auckland with the bachelor’s degree,<br>so I’m honoured and privileged by being<br>called on to offer my reflections over the<br>years. So thank you for that.<br>As you ask, yeah, my formative years were<br>both in New Zealand and Samoa. I went to elementary<br>school in Western Samoa in a period when you’re<br>just youthful and engaged in typical activities,<br>whether it’s in the village or on the sport’s<br>field.<br>Just a typical average childhood upbringing.<br>It wasn’t until, I think it was 1984, when<br>we migrated to New Zealand where I started<br>school in Mt Roskill in a primary school and<br>then onto secondary intermediate.<br>So yeah, I think those early years had a lot<br>to do with my own characteristics and a drive<br>where I was able to identify possible areas<br>of career development. Looking around my family<br>and the enabling environment, you’re always<br>looking for role models to emulate and there<br>were a couple in the family that certainly<br>stood out that provided a pathway for me and<br>created an outlook that maybe I wouldn’t<br>have had if I hadn’t had that support from<br>the family.<br>You had your senior schooling in New Zealand,<br>and I understand you actually contemplated<br>dentistry. What persuaded you into planning?<br>So, I was back and forth between high schools,<br>and in Samoa, where I spent my final years<br>of secondary school, you’ve got an opportunity<br>to achieve merit and therefore be qualified<br>for scholarships, and those are certainly<br>the targets for us young students.<br>My interest in dentistry was probably picked<br>up from my older brother who also studied<br>dentistry in America, so I was looking at<br>that subject to be where I was headed towards.<br>Now, the government of Samoa has only small<br>opportunities for various disciplines and<br>priority needs for the development of the<br>country, and dentistry’s not included.<br>Although medicine is very important, it wasn’t<br>considered one of the priorities where the<br>government would offer that support. I was<br>also doing well in geography and in that area<br>of urban geography, so this opportunity was<br>asked of me to look into the Urban Planning<br>programme in the University of Auckland, and<br>I thought as these opportunities are very<br>rare, scholarship being funded through the<br>government of Samoa, I took on that challenge<br>and, yeah, a different pathway from what I<br>had envisaged.<br>But much more fun.<br>It’s led me to places where I never would<br>have contemplated, and I don’t think any<br>other field would have given me that opportunity<br>to travel.<br>I have much the same feeling about planning.<br>It was almost an unknown, and it takes you<br>into such an expansion of possibilities. So,<br>do you have any reflections on your years<br>when you were actually at university here<br>as a young man?<br>Yeah, so first year of university, the daunting<br>thing about it is coming from Samoa, where<br>the standard may not be as high as our New<br>Zealand counterparts.<br>Certainly, my first term, first year were<br>a period of trying to gauge where you fit<br>in to the whole curriculum and how you benchmark<br>against your peers. So, there was that nervousness,<br>but also the fear of, if you were to fail<br>you’d lose this opportunity, so there was<br>a strong drive to do well, and surprisingly,<br>I was pleased with some of the results that<br>encouraged me to do more of the same.<br>In saying that, I had some really fun lecturers<br>in my first year where I thought, hey look,<br>this is an area that has a lot of weight in<br>and critical importance to the development<br>of communities and society.<br>So I thought, hey look, it’s an opportunity<br>to learn more about.<br>So, I stuck through the four year course,<br>and obviously mingled with a lot of great<br>teachers and lecturers during my period there.<br>Some of our former students or staff may recall,<br>but people like Tom Fookes and Bruce Hucker<br>were stand-out people in my mind very early<br>on. Then others came along with the legal<br>framework with Prue Taylor, Robert Guild with<br>infrastructure planning.<br>There was a range of different elements to<br>stimulate the thought process, and just got<br>me more engaged in planning.<br>Then you returned to Samoa and you joined<br>the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment,<br>and in no time at all you worked your way<br>to the top, becoming the principal planner<br>and ultimately the Assistant Chief Executive<br>Officer of Planning. What drew you back to<br>Samoa, and in hindsight, what were the highlights<br>of that particular phase of your career?<br>I really appreciated the opportunity that<br>the government gave me and funded my scholarship,<br>so there is a sense of obligation to return<br>and serve the country. I was very fortunate<br>that there were positions available and they<br>were looking at developing the planning system<br>in Samoa, so you didn’t feel like it was<br>an unwelcome degree, you didn’t feel like<br>there was no role for you to play in government.<br>I wasn’t looking at the private sector at<br>that point in time. I felt that the basic<br>framework of planning per se needed to exist<br>for the private sector to operate a little<br>bit more smoother.<br>So, I saw a real big opportunity to work with<br>the government through – at the time – the<br>Department of Land Survey and Environment,<br>and then we went through a lot of restructuring<br>early 2000. The public service was going through<br>a lot of good reforms, which saw the development<br>of urban planning with the support of the<br>international financial institutions such<br>as the Asian Development Bank, that was my<br>first introduction. Then also separately these<br>parallel projects run by the various ministries<br>where the environment plays a critical role<br>in trying to coordinate and facilitate that<br>development outcome.<br>So, there was a lot of motivation for me to<br>come back and experience that, and then saying<br>that, I did put out a few feelers before I<br>left, just to test the market before I did<br>go back, but I think I made the right choice<br>going back to Samoa, serving the community,<br>serving the government, and then making a<br>real go of our planning system.<br>The legislation was passed, this organisation<br>which didn’t exist was a one-man band when<br>I joined, with loosely aligned objectives<br>without any institutional laws or statutory<br>teeth. It was a real great time to be involved<br>in planning after being exposed at university<br>about the theories and the various development<br>aspects, but then seeing it happen on the<br>ground and being part of that, that was pretty<br>exciting.<br>I understand from people in Apia that you’re<br>still greatly missed actually, Jude. So, you<br>managed to combine that time actually with<br>higher qualifications.<br>So you whizzed off and got a Master of Urban<br>and Regional Planning from the University<br>of Hawaii, and you had stints at the US House<br>of Representatives.<br>I thought it must have been in the Bush-era<br>actually. You went to the Wharton’s School<br>of Business, and the Florida Public Utility<br>Research Centre, and finally you tootled back<br>here and got a first-class master’s in engineering<br>at the University of Auckland in engineering<br>studies and construction. So, what attracted<br>you to the States?<br>I saw it as an opportunity again. You know,<br>if you’re familiar, the opportunity for<br>scholarships are out there and development<br>of civil service and even private sector employees<br>are quite available.<br>So, I was quite keen to try a different region,<br>and thinking of planning in America I thought,<br>hey look, this is an opportunity that I wouldn’t<br>get. I was focused on trying to get a degree<br>in the University of Hawaii and get that exposure<br>first-hand of how it operates in the US, so<br>I was very fortunate to spend two years there.<br>Again, some very distinguished professors<br>who helped steer me along the way. Looking<br>at the developments there, and certainly the<br>exposure had by interning with the US capital<br>at the time, it was also an eye-opener to<br>be involved in the political discussions at<br>that particular time.<br>It must have been fascinating. So, why did<br>you turn to the dark side, to engineering?<br>Funny you say that. I mean, as a planner you<br>go through these points of discovery, I guess,<br>where you probably should build on some skillsets<br>to strengthen your abilities in the field,<br>and I was certainly looking at — one was<br>urban design, thinking whether I should engage<br>in that aspect of the discipline, or whether<br>I should get more involved in engineering.<br>The way I saw my career strategically would<br>be through an engineering degree to help strengthen<br>the technical abilities with the roles that<br>I had been playing, and the development impact<br>that it would have on the ground for a wider<br>community.<br>So, that drew me to getting a degree in engineering,<br>and in particular construction management.<br>Going through the process is quite revealing<br>and also beneficial for the client as well,<br>or the beneficiaries that you’re working<br>with, to arrive at a result that looks at<br>both an urban planning perspective and how<br>infrastructure affects communities and looking<br>at the nitty gritty of getting the work done<br>and built. So, I thought that would provide<br>very good ammunition in my skillsets to do<br>a little bit more.<br>It sounds as though you were the ultimate<br>planner too, and you were very strategic and<br>conscious in terms of career development.<br>I was just interested, cos in 2013 you departed<br>Apia for Manila, probably a significant disruption<br>to your family but nonetheless such a wonderful<br>opportunity. So, what enticed you to the ADB?<br>With the exposure working for government for<br>over 13 years, you get to sit shoulder to<br>shoulder with a lot of the professionals either<br>in the World Bank, the European Investment<br>Bank, or the Asian Development Bank. So, you’re<br>working with these professionals on a day-to-day<br>basis, and a thought struck me, hey look,<br>it might be interesting to see a Pacific face<br>on the other side. So, I thought the diversity<br>angle would certainly help bringing perspective<br>to the Pacific community with a Pacific person<br>sitting on the bank side and supporting our<br>region, so that was one of the drivers for<br>me.<br>Then being recruited through the Asian Development<br>Bank, I was fortunate to be based in the Pacific<br>office in Fiji, so I didn’t have to move<br>that far, but I did have to adjust to the<br>cultural norms of a bigger institution. That<br>was an exciting time as well, getting exposed<br>to other Pacific Island country development<br>needs and being part of the process to provide<br>the assistance needed to support certain areas,<br>whether it’s through transport, urban planning,<br>water supplying, or sewerage, or even energy,<br>as was the case too in some of our projects.<br>It was also an opportunity to try something<br>different, but also test myself and move on<br>to another challenge and come at it from a<br>different angle.<br>Well, as you move out into that wider arena,<br>I’m going to hand you over to Professor<br>Jenny Dixon.<br>Thank you, Elizabeth.<br>Talofa, Jude. Look, I’m sure all the people<br>watching the webinar tonight would be really<br>keen to hear a little bit more about your<br>current role at the Asian Development Bank.<br>You’ve acquired a wonderful array of skills<br>and qualifications to really prepare you for<br>your work, but I think we’d be really interested<br>to hear a little bit more about what you are<br>actually doing in South Asia.<br>Thank you, Jenny. The South Asia region is<br>quite large, a couple of projects here and<br>there across various sectors, but I’ll focus<br>more on the urban and water division which<br>I currently am in. We’re largely focused<br>on urban planning initiatives to make cities<br>liveable, so there is an element of integrated<br>development to incorporate a multi-sectoral<br>approach in a lot of our project investment<br>work. So, ADB, or my particular role at this<br>point in time, is identifying the need and<br>developing a project proposal where we work<br>hand in hand with the client to develop a<br>project with ADB financing to support the<br>implementation of the programme.<br>More currently we’re dealing with Bhutan<br>in an affordable housing development project.<br>We’re scoping out various components to<br>build a modest amount of homes with a new<br>client and building the capacity of the local<br>institution there around how they deliver<br>housing, but also how they operate and maintain<br>these homes.<br>Then on the other spectrum, in India we’re<br>dealing a lot with rural water supply, based<br>off the federal government’s drive around<br>drinking water supply to all of India by 2024.<br>So, we’re trying to catch up and support<br>various states, in particular the Himachal<br>Pradesh state where I’m currently working<br>and developing a rural water supply project,<br>120 million, and hopefully deploy that over<br>a five-year period.<br>Then on the other end of the project cycle,<br>we get involved in the evaluation and the<br>project closure or completion end of project.<br>We analyse how well we’ve done in terms<br>of achieving the outputs and how effective<br>we were, both the client and the bank identifying<br>what efficiency issues there may have been,<br>sustainability concerns if any, which are<br>largely the case in low-capacity countries<br>where we currently work in. So, trying to<br>build in either funding mechanisms to ensure<br>that they are able to sustain over a period<br>of time and get that assurance from the government,<br>whether it’s through taxes or tariffs or<br>even grant transfers by the federal- or central-level<br>government.<br>In a nutshell, we try and package various<br>products, pull it together with the client,<br>agree on the framework moving forward. We<br>present that to our board, and this usually<br>takes four to six months to prepare. We get<br>board approval and then we move on through<br>to implementation and support the client through<br>that process.<br>So, it’s obviously interesting thinking<br>about South Asia and some of the issues that<br>you’re engaging with, and when we reflect<br>back here to this country, we’ve got really<br>big debates on the future of our ports, on<br>reforming Three Waters, upgrading our physical<br>infrastructure, thinking about urban intensification<br>housing affordability, impacts of climate<br>change on both farming practices and of course<br>our urban lifestyles. So in fact, we actually<br>do have much in common in terms of the scale<br>of the issues that we’re all grappling with.<br>I think we’re all in a big period of transition,<br>but I’m interested before we perhaps return<br>to some of those issues, just how you see<br>the South Asia region grappling with the impacts<br>of COVID, and how that’s affected some of<br>the work that you’ve been doing at the Asian<br>Development Bank?<br>Yeah, it’s certainly unprecedented times,<br>and it’s thrown in a lot of uncertainly<br>in the region and for the governments also,<br>for their planning purposes. So, it does have<br>a real impact at the macro level even down<br>to the community level where people may not<br>have access to jobs or even able to pay bills,<br>in terms of whether it’s housing or whether<br>it’s utilities. So there is a strong need<br>for that support. The clients that we work<br>with, the governments acknowledge that and<br>are looking for that support.<br>Now, the bank and most of the development<br>partners offer a range of support in a time<br>like. There’s areas where there’s COVID<br>recovery support around budgetary support,<br>and that just feeds into the government’s<br>purse to try and continue its services as<br>best it can. It also recognises that, in terms<br>of trying to get a project investment onboard,<br>some of these discussions have been three<br>to four years in advance and the preparation<br>cycle’s already happened, so there can be<br>delays to that, which we are seeing.<br>We get project staff also affected by COVID<br>personally and directly where it does slow<br>people down, so we’re certainly cognisant<br>of the impact it has on a personal level without<br>insurrections with the client and their team.<br>So, factoring a COVID factor in our processing<br>is certainly something that’s recognised<br>and needing to be acknowledged.<br>Now in saying that, we’re also pushed to<br>the limit to try and get as much done as soon<br>as possible, given that these needs are real,<br>and getting the services on the ground is<br>an ultimate priority. For example, with the<br>water sector projects, with COVID and the<br>hygiene aspects, they go hand in hand in trying<br>to work through a prevention programme to<br>ensure that people stay aware and alert of<br>how to behave, and practices during this COVID<br>period if the vaccination rates aren’t as<br>high.<br>Now some of the coping mechanisms, say for<br>example, in landlocked countries such as Bhutan<br>or Nepal, you’re seeing a lot more closed<br>borders, and certain regions you flick the<br>switch where some will go into an enhanced<br>quarantine phase or levels as we have in New<br>Zealand, where they’re trying to control<br>movement and people’s safety. So, these<br>factors we’re seeing in South Asia are almost<br>what we’re seeing here now. New Zealand<br>has it a lot luckier, say for example, if<br>we’re looking at India and their rate of<br>infection and the deaths that we’re seeing<br>there.<br>So, it’s certainly something that we’ve<br>acknowledge. The institution has also set<br>up different modalities to support the developing<br>member countries, and as project teams, we’re<br>here to try and get the investments approved<br>and then on the ground as soon as possible.<br>So, there’s some pretty big challenges really<br>for organisations like the Asian Development<br>Bank and the World Bank when you are confronted<br>with the kind of problems that you see in<br>the region that you’re engaged in. I can<br>recall when I was in India in 2019, there<br>was very, very severe pollution, for example,<br>in Delhi, and it had been created by farmers<br>burning off stubble as part of their farming<br>practices, and of course it was having a very,<br>very significant and serious impact on air<br>quality in Delhi. In fact, apparently it was<br>only actually a more recent problem, so I’m<br>not quite sure quite what accounted for that,<br>but how do we deal with the levels of transformation<br>that we need to undertake if you’re thinking<br>about the rural economies in a place like<br>India? How do we really go about changing<br>those practices in order to try and improve<br>things like air quality?<br>Well, that’s probably a real tough one,<br>especially when you’re dealing with these<br>rural communities that have no other alternative,<br>and then if you’ve got industries that are<br>also in that periphery that are also emitting,<br>maybe there’s a level of control that could<br>happen. I can also lay claim to have seen<br>the transboundary effect of the air quality<br>in Pakistan. So, it doesn’t just limit itself<br>to India, and it’s a difficult one to get<br>a grip of. Certainly regulating the industries,<br>enforcing what can happen, and maybe from<br>a planning side whether these industries should<br>be and could be encouraged into other areas<br>where maybe you’ve got that regulatory control<br>of the standards that are being emitted, in<br>terms of the air particle emissions. Then<br>also just trying to follow through on what<br>kind of support could be had at the household<br>level, and these are small-scale households<br>that may not be akin to that level of control,<br>so you probably need to find some alternatives.<br>It’s very exciting having someone who’s<br>a planner engaged in those kind of issues<br>and problems, which are massive, but it’s<br>also about being part and parcel of ultimately<br>what will be transformation of economies going<br>forward. I do think it’s a really exciting<br>opportunity to be right in the thick of all<br>of that.<br>Now, there’s another example that comes<br>to me, and it’s around, I guess, coming<br>out of COVID, we have seen that the ports,<br>for example, in South Asia and elsewhere,<br>have become much more strategic given the<br>value of shipping. I know that there’s been<br>some new business models developed in South<br>Asia around ports, and I wondered how you<br>see that and how you see those ways of operating<br>influencing economic development <br>in these regions?<br>Cities themselves are the cusp of this urbanisation<br>trend where you see a lot of growth happening,<br>and we’re always looking at developments<br>that can stimulate economic opportunities<br>across the city environments. Certainly, ports<br>play a big role. I’m probably not the person<br>to speak on the particular role it would have,<br>coming from an urban and water perspective.<br>I think our motivations now are around transit-oriented<br>developments and value-captured financing,<br>where you look at strategic locations where<br>you can encourage certain activities, mixed<br>uses, to stimulate certain economic activities,<br>and then finding ways to identify revenue<br>streams for either the government or businesses<br>that would have a sustainable impact for their<br>long-term operation. Definitely a topic.<br>Yes, it’s a really important topic, I think,<br>going forward. South Asia, of course, presents<br>massive opportunities for New Zealand, and<br>do you have any advice for New Zealanders<br>doing business in this region, in terms of<br>the knowledge that they need to go into these<br>countries, and thinking about their cultural<br>competence, what they need to know about negotiating<br>interculturally with businesses in these regions?<br>The context for this, of course, is that we<br>are hearing a lot more about the need to diversify<br>our business overseas. This applies also,<br>not only to business, but of course international<br>education, as we’re looking at our sources<br>of international education. There’s certainly<br>opportunities in places like India and Sri<br>Lanka for students and those sorts of things.<br>So, I’m just interested in the advice you<br>might give to people wanting to conduct business<br>in this region as to what sort of things do<br>they need to look out for?<br>Another tough one. The area is so diverse<br>and trying to get a grip of the cultural norms<br>in a particular country, and even your counterparts<br>that you deal with is, I guess, like you said,<br>it is something that we need to be aware of<br>and certainly leaving a good first impression<br>leaves a lasting impact for continued business.<br>I’ve noticed in my travels through Pakistan<br>where there’s a strong sense of pride in<br>New Zealand, and in particular the way the<br>New Zealand Prime Minister handled the mosque<br>shootings recently, so the profile, I’ve<br>noticed, is quite renowned as she has paved<br>the way of how genuine, how sincere New Zealanders<br>are, and I think that’s been a positive<br>influence in how people interact with New<br>Zealanders.<br>The bank that we work with is obviously a<br>Japanese bank, and the norms are quite subtle,<br>but being aware of the dynamics as you talk<br>to colleagues about how to adjust certain<br>mannerisms and styles, it’s certainly something<br>that people need to pay attention to. In saying<br>that too, you can have some very great relationships<br>and friendships develop in the region, and<br>I’ve seen that first hand where the bonds<br>that you make are quite strong and there are<br>a range of international folk that work in<br>the region, both New Zealand, Australia, that<br>find it quite rewarding working in this region.<br>We’re always on the lookout for consultants<br>to help us in our work in the region, and<br>there have been some old hands that are continually<br>engaged, but if there are people in the audience<br>or others in the university that are looking<br>for international exposure, there’s opportunities<br>to engage and see what can be done. I think<br>you’d find it quite enriching the kinds<br>of clients that you deal with; very committed<br>to getting the job done, passionate about<br>what they do, knowledgeable about what needs<br>to be done, so they provide that local context,<br>and the New Zealand experience certainly should<br>elevate problem-solving for our clients or<br>providing services to the region.<br>What would see as the biggest planning challenges<br>in your region? I know we’re taking a very<br>broad view here, big macro region, it’s<br>enormously large and populated, but what would<br>you single out as perhaps some of the really<br>big planning challenges in South Asia? Then<br>I think we’ll come back and we’ll touch<br>on the Pacific. We come back to the Pacific<br>in a minute.<br>I still believe, and I mentioned this, urbanisation<br>is growing at an alarming rate where you need<br>a lot of coordination amongst various institutions,<br>and then trying to deliver the services and<br>not having these systems trip over themselves.<br>I think this is certainly a strong area where<br>you’ve seen countries in the region asking<br>for that level of support, whether that’s<br>reviewing their existing systems, reviewing<br>their structure plans, their central development<br>plans, and then putting some value in terms<br>of how do you implement and resource these<br>needs?<br>So, these are conversations that I saw a decade<br>ago that are still relevant now, and even<br>more so as population increases and you’re<br>seeing the expansion of cities in these countries<br>encroach on scarce land resources. So, there’s<br>a real discussion point where you need to<br>look at options and finding out what’s best<br>for that context in direct communication and<br>partnership with the client. We’re also<br>encouraged to reach down even further to the<br>grassroots to make sure that there’s that<br>participatory approach where they’re engaged<br>in the process of development.<br>So, you’re seeing a real need, and the urban<br>space is diverse and covers a range of sectors,<br>whether it’s power, housing, water supply,<br>wastewater, transportation, and it’s just<br>trying to get a grip on how do you control<br>or offer to manage that growth and the governance<br>around it.<br>Let’s come back and talk a little bit about<br>the Pacific, because of course, we have a<br>very close relationship with the Pacific,<br>with many Pacific peoples living in Tāmaki<br>Makaurau and elsewhere in New Zealand. There<br>are lots of players now. I mean, the Pacific’s<br>our largest ocean. It’s hugely important,<br>it’s got a lot of strategic importance,<br>there are many players, big nations all involved.<br>We’re even seeing Britain show interest<br>in the Pacific, which seems a bit ironic.<br>How do you see New Zealand’s support for<br>various issues in the Pacific playing out?<br>How do people in the Pacific perhaps regard<br>what we’re doing and how effective is it<br>in terms of our support for some of the issues<br>that are currently pretty important in the<br>Pacific, such as climate change, public health,<br>economic development? There are many issues,<br>I think, which are quite challenging in the<br>Pacific.<br>I think the disclaimer is it’s purely a<br>reflection and what I’ve seen, and certainly<br>from my engagement in the Pacific with the<br>New Zealand government or the New Zealand<br>aid programme, that’s something that I’ve<br>found to be welcomed. You see their engagement<br>upfront in dialogue with countries and these<br>development partner forums where you’re<br>engaging and trying to coordinate as best<br>you can across the different groups at the<br>table and trying to build on each other’s<br>strengths. So it’s not trying to, I guess,<br>carve out your piece and say, ‘Look, this<br>is our territory,’ but working together<br>to deliver a result for the client that’s<br>in the best interests of the country.<br>We’ve seen that in Fiji, in Samoa, in places<br>like Kiribati where they’re a respected<br>aid partner, and there’s a particular area<br>where New Zealand would focus in on where<br>I’ve seen, for example, in Kiribati where<br>it’s sanitation. Certainly, the health sector’s<br>also an important one, and that’s something<br>that I think we should all be grateful for.<br>That level of support is needed in places<br>where there’s just not enough revenue to<br>support government operations.<br>I’ve seen this with New Zealand where in<br>Samoa we try to engage a very upfront special<br>planning exercise through the New Zealand<br>office. That was through great support and<br>championing within the government, and we<br>saw that happen with the Apia waterfront,<br>so it came to fruition there. A little dialogue<br>can lead to a result in these countries that<br>I think New Zealand can be proud of.<br>Certainly, more could be done. It is our back<br>doorstep, so to speak, and a huge population<br>of Pacific Islanders that are here in New<br>Zealand, and certainly that community is very<br>strong. I think they’re doing great work,<br>and just trying to coordinate as best they<br>can, and we’re certainly supportive of that<br>effort. Like I said, it’s strategic trying<br>to coordinate everyone’s involvement at<br>various positions so that we can maximise<br>people’s strengths. Say, for example, if<br>New Zealand’s doing some due diligence or<br>some sectoral assessments upfront. Say, for<br>example, the bank had also come in and pick<br>off that work and identify, okay, where are<br>the recommendations where it could result<br>in an investment project that the bank could<br>get involved in and support the country? If<br>the country does see that as a priority, that<br>engagement with the various partners is something<br>that is a huge success, and we see it evidently<br>in the Pacific more so than any other place.<br>So, what would your advice to planners be<br>who wanted to specialise in the area of infrastructure,<br>planning, and development, and also think<br>about working abroad? Reflecting back on your<br>career which has been incredibly rich, and<br>you’ve gone off and you’ve done further<br>qualifications to strengthen your background,<br>which I think is very impressive, you’ve<br>really thought very strategically about your<br>career, what advice would you perhaps give<br>to planners who are perhaps not long out of<br>university, thinking about what they might<br>do, where they might go? They’re interested<br>in working abroad, thinking about Asia Pacific<br>as a place where they might work for a few<br>years, get to grapple with some really interesting<br>challenging issues. What do you think is really<br>important in terms of, not just the skills<br>but the personal attributes of people working<br>in these areas? What is important in terms<br>of the outlook and attitude that you would<br>need to have as an outsider going in and working<br>in another country?<br>I think if someone has identified a career,<br>whether it’s in the international community<br>… I remember a couple of classes with Robert<br>Riddell at the time, where you hear about<br>the World Bank, you hear about the activity<br>in the Pacific and globally, and so that started<br>giving me some signals, well okay, well that’s<br>out there for me as a career path. That, I<br>guess, sparked some interest.<br>I would encourage current students to first<br>of all complete the degree. It really does<br>make a difference to get you in the door,<br>and then if you’re able to develop some<br>level of experience, and that can only happen<br>by doing some tough jobs. My career in the<br>government of Samoa started off as a typical<br>government employee earning 11,000 tālā<br>a year, which is significantly low compared<br>to what you would earn in New Zealand. I think<br>the starting rate was around 45,000 to 50,000<br>NZD.<br>So, if you’re not driven by the financial<br>rewards, I think the investment upfront with<br>getting the experience is gonna be a tremendous<br>benefit in the long term. Then also voicing<br>your aspirations in terms of where you’d<br>like to be, so that people are there to support<br>you along that path, whether it’s your employer<br>or whether it’s through mentors at the university.<br>These were all areas where I found a lot of<br>support, and to be honest, I needed that,<br>both from the University of Auckland’s planning<br>school, both from my employer, and that gave<br>me a broader view of the horizon.<br>I think as a personal attribute, Pacific Islanders<br>are generally soft-spoken and quite kind-hearted<br>people, so I think having a sincere and genuine<br>outlook with the interactions that you do<br>have really does have an impact on who you’re<br>dealing with and the relationships you build.<br>I think we underestimate the impact of having<br>very strong relationships, and that’s certainly<br>something that’s come across for me as strong.<br>I’ve seen a variety of styles over the years,<br>and all successful in their own right, but<br>you could have characteristic where are quite<br>aggressive, and you leave a trail of broken<br>shells.<br>So, it’s those soft skills that can be so<br>important in these situations, anywhere in<br>fact, probably in any part of the world that<br>we might be working in, but it’s really<br>understanding, being empathetic, being able<br>to read people, listening, and having a sense<br>of what we call now these days cultural competence,<br>that we didn’t talk about so much 20 years<br>ago when we were teaching students. We’ve<br>become a lot more conscious of just the importance<br>of relationship-building, and that’s where<br>so many things really start from having a<br>good constructive relationship that’s of<br>value to both parties or if there’s multiple<br>parties, because you need that. You need such<br>consensus when you’re grappling with such<br>big issues like urbanisation or rural transformation<br>or whatever it is. It takes so much, I think,<br>engagement and goodwill and consensus and<br>commitment from so many different parties,<br>and I think it’s just so exciting to see<br>someone like yourself right in the heart of<br>dealing with some very big issues that are<br>of such importance as we work our way through<br>the outcome of COVID, as we deal with things<br>like economic transformation.<br>So, I think at this point I might throw it<br>back to Elizabeth, who may have one or two<br>more wrap-up questions she wants to ask you.<br>Well, I’m just wondering where your strategic<br>plan is going next? What’s your long-term<br>plan, Jude? If you have one.<br>The immediate probably is a little bit more<br>tangible in terms of just trying to do a good<br>job and delivering for our clients. So, over<br>the next three years, certainly that’s on<br>my agenda. The bank has quite a range of opportunities,<br>and you see that through different positions<br>and you could even become a country director,<br>where you’re outposted to, say, a country<br>specific. So, there’s certainly some opportunities<br>in the future where, if given to opportunity,<br>I’d certainly raise my hand up for. In the<br>interim, just trying to build the skillsets<br>needed in that type of role. Looking at corporate<br>finance, financial analysis, and even economics<br>as well, are all handy to have up your sleeve.<br>I think that would probably be over the next<br>10 years, where I see myself now. Going back<br>to Samoa’s probably also a consideration<br>after gaining this level of experience, to<br>see how else, towards the twilight, when I’ve<br>still got a lot of energy to contribute even<br>more, I think that’s an opportunity as well.<br>If I could just make a comment here, when<br>I went to Samoa with our alumni trips, I was<br>really struck by the number of University<br>of Auckland alumni returning to Samoa after<br>many years away but going back and really<br>contributing to the local economy, and I just<br>thought that was really fabulous actually.<br>A lot of very senior women, actually, were<br>occupying very senior jobs also I’ve noticed<br>in Apia. So again, going back and really contributing.<br>I think that’s very important.<br>Yeah, and it’s home, so you do wanna go<br>back to family and contribute and pay homage<br>to that opportunity granted over 25 years<br>ago. So, there’s a lot of respect also given<br>to that period and the opportunities that<br>it’s presented, so good to go back.<br>And it’s warmer. What’s it like to live<br>in Manila?<br>Congestion’s probably the standout. If you’ve<br>heard about traffic there in Manila, where<br>you’ve got 10 million people hovering around,<br>you’ve got mega malls. This was another<br>discussion we had back in school in ‘96/’99,<br>that these mega malls were a driving force<br>in these economies, so you see it first hand<br>in Manila as well. It’s air pollution, quality<br>of life is quite different, you need to get<br>out of town to enjoy the Philippines. I mean<br>in saying that, the people are beautiful,<br>very friendly and warm, and it’s a beautiful<br>place to be in when you do get outside.<br>Well, what an amazing life you have already<br>had, and we’re going to be very interested<br>in where it goes next. I really want to thank<br>you so much, Jude, and an enormous burst of<br>applause from our virtual audience, and it’s<br>just been an absolutely fascinating hour.<br>Thank you so much, Professor Jenny Dixon too.<br>With that, I have only to let everybody know<br>that the Fast Forward series is taking a short<br>break. It will return on Tuesday the 14th<br>of September. This time at 6:30 with Michael<br>Milojevic in conversation with Brendan MacFarlane<br>who’s the director of Jakob + MacFarlane<br>architects Paris. So, head to our website<br>fastforward.ac.nz for details, register for<br>the webinar, or use the QR code. With that,<br>pō mārie and thank you again, Jude Kohlhase.<br>Thank you, Elizabeth, thank you Jennifer.<br>Thank you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
