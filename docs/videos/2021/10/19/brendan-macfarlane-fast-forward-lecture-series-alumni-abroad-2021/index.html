Built on 12.8 hectares of land,  <br>it will be 2.5 times bigger than the current site. <br>Designed with sustainability at the forefront,  <br>the new plant will have extensive recycling <br>capability on site for water and waste. It will  <br>also include new state-of-the-art technology and <br>equipment, enabling the business to manufacture  <br>the full range of our GIB plasterboard <br>products, with a high degree of flexibility. <br>The new Winstone Wallboards facility reinforces <br>our commitment to manufacturing in New Zealand,  <br>and we look forward to <br>sharing this journey with you. <br>Welcome everyone. Bonjour tout le monde. <br>I’m Michael Milojevic, a Professional  <br>Teaching Fellow here at the University of <br>Auckland School of Architecture and Planning.  <br>In a couple of minutes we’ll have with us our <br>man in Paris, Brendan MacFarlane, director of  <br>Jakob + MacFarlane Architects.<br>This Spring 2021 Fast Forward  <br>programme of conversations with outstanding <br>alumni abroad is organised by Julia Gatley  <br>and Elizabeth Aitken Rose, on behalf of the <br>School’s History and Theory Research Hub.  <br>This, the fourth conversation, is again sponsored <br>by GIB, who have been steadfast in their support  <br>for the School’s Fast Forward programmes <br>for many years running now, so bravo, GIB. <br>During this evening’s conversation we <br>invite your questions. Just use the  <br>Zoom Q&amp;A function and Brendan and I will see <br>what’s there towards the end of the hour. <br>Well, Christchurch-born and Wellington-raised <br>Brendan MacFarlane is a leading French architect.  <br>With his partner, Dominique Jakob, their joint <br>practice was founded in 1998, as they were  <br>catapulted onto the Paris scene with a prominent  <br>commission in which they privileged <br>innovative digital technology.  <br>Since that time, their experimental and sometimes <br>biomorphic form making has set them apart and  <br>drawn much praise and numerous awards.<br>They have realised a constellation  <br>of significant and award-winning cultural <br>and housing projects in the French capital,  <br>but also in Lyon, Orléans, Limousin, Montpellier, <br>La Rochelle and Pont-Audemer. In Belgian cities,  <br>they have now a school of architecture on <br>the go at Mons and an innovative vertical  <br>village housing tower at Knokke-Heist, which <br>is right on the coast near Bruges, I take it. <br>I first came to realise the scope of MacFarlane’s <br>achievements in planning the itinerary for the  <br>2014 Alpine Studio Study Tour, when two <br>exceptional and eye-poppingly bright  <br>urban markers for the Confluence quartier in <br>Lyon were among our must-see destinations there.  <br>They were done by a Kiwi. Wow. The 2017 Alpine <br>Tour programme revisited both these projects,  <br>so in all, well over a hundred Auckland students <br>have gazed over and into the Cube Orange.  <br>As you can see, it’s a cyclopean object with <br>a conoid void cored out of one corner and up  <br>through the centre. Just a few hundred metres down <br>the same Somme embankment is this intensely lime  <br>green Euronews block, which is a pair of oculi, <br>which also morphed into atria for light, air,  <br>and river views. I think you’ll agree it’s <br>all quite deformative, just like, as I’ve  <br>learned in the past week, Brendan likes things.<br>From the start in life, MacFarlane took himself  <br>generally in a north-eastwardly trajectory, <br>starting in the South Island and ending up in the  <br>Île-de-France. Well, not long after high school, <br>architecture seemed like it might be his thing.  <br>He did his first year here at Auckland, <br>followed by a couple of years in Sydney,  <br>including time at Harry Seidler’s office, and then <br>a long, deep engagement in the LA scene at SCI-Arc  <br>and Morphosis, followed then by a master’s at <br>Harvard GSD, and that rounded up the 1980s. <br>London was next, before coming to rest, <br>so to speak, in Paris in the early ‘90s,  <br>where he and Dominique Jakob, who was herself <br>a SCI-Arc/Morphosis veteran, met. Brendan and  <br>Dominique have long engaged with the academy. <br>Brendan has held multi-year teaching posts at The  <br>Bartlett and the AA in London, the École Spéciale <br>d'Architecture in Paris, and SCI-Arc in LA,  <br>while being simultaneously much in demand as <br>a speaker at architecture events worldwide. <br>It’s important to signal that the quality of <br>Jakob and MacFarlane’s media has meant that they  <br>have exhibited continuous and widely at the Centre <br>Pompidou, San Francisco MOMA, the Venice Biennale,  <br>SCI-Arc, the Victoria and Albert, the Mori Art <br>Museum, ArchiLab FRAC, and the Aedes Architecture  <br>Forum. At the moment, they have a big model in the <br>2021 Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism,  <br>and they’re showing a film at the UN Climate <br>Change Conference in Glasgow next month. <br>While I’ve left out more than I’ve recounted <br>here, I must add that this year, the distinguished  <br>French publishing house Flammarion has come out <br>with a hefty tome on the first two decades of  <br>Jakob + MacFarlane, and it’s by the <br>way the first monograph on their work. <br>So, good morning, Brendan.<br>Good morning. <br>How are you?<br>Very good, thank you. <br>Before we scroll back through the decades to hear <br>about a Christchurch boy ending up in France,  <br>please tell us a bit about your practice. <br>Am I right in saying that you’re located  <br>in the Rue des Petites Écuries in the 10th <br>Arrondissement? That’s the, I think, historic  <br>centre about 30 minutes’ stroll to the great fiery <br>construction site of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame.  <br>So, if you could just tell us how many you <br>are and what’s the practice like in the time  <br>of COVID for you? For as I understand it, you have <br>projects throughout the country and of course,  <br>across the border in Belgium. Does a pass <br>sanitaire, vaccination passport, work there? <br>It’s a good question. Thank you for having <br>me, Michael, and Auckland University. For me,  <br>it’s actually really fantastic to talk to you <br>guys, because in a way it’s something which I’ve  <br>never done since leaving Auckland University. It’s <br>the first kind of contact. So for me, it’s sort of  <br>historical, emotional, coming around in a <br>circle. So, I really appreciate the opportunity. <br>I mean, to talk about the pass <br>sanitaire, it’s where France is today.  <br>Like you guys are now coming through these <br>different phases in New Zealand, which I’m  <br>following really carefully, from Lockdown 4, <br>3, 2, all of these different levels. France,  <br>well, thank heavens, hopefully we’ve gone through <br>that and of course we are now in a pass sanitaire,  <br>which means that we can — but to get a coffee, <br>we need to show our pass sanitaire in Paris.  <br>Just to give you an extreme example.<br>Well, at least you can get a coffee. <br>When you go in and ask for just a simple thing <br>like a coffee, you need to show your — it’s an ID  <br>and it gives you your name, your age, and of <br>course there’s the code. That gives us access  <br>also onto trains, it gives us access onto planes, <br>it gives us access into, for example, going north  <br>of France, you mentioned with Belgium.<br>Yeah. <br>So, in a way I think it’s a freedom of movement <br>which we’ve essentially collectively earned and  <br>of course, there’s a certain amount of <br>manifestation. People against this idea of  <br>freedom and the idea of identifying yourself. <br>In a way, somehow this aspect of society,  <br>how free are we today with COVID and how maybe <br>the COVID thing has also led to a certain,  <br>some people say control, where we are now <br>identified. If I get that coffee in the morning,  <br>they know at what time I was there and what <br>location [overspeaking] the following day  <br>etc. So in fact, my life can be — that’s <br>information, that’s data that I’m creating. <br>The pass sanitaire doesn’t look as though it’s <br>going to stop. It’s something which will probably  <br>continue and become something else, <br>so we’re living in intriguing,  <br>interesting, strange, conflictual times.<br>In terms of — nope, it’s true, our office is right  <br>in the centre of Paris, and it’s something that we <br>really love because we can walk out and we can be  <br>really close to events and things. It’s true that <br>when the Notre-Dame went up in flames, I walked  <br>down. I walked, I ran, I walked, and I ran down <br>the Boulevard. I didn’t even get in the Metro, and  <br>it was within not even half an hour, it was within <br>15 minutes, of being in front of just this vision  <br>of a kind of nightmare.<br>My goodness. <br>That was certainly a totally powerful point.<br>Yeah, and so just tell us a bit about the size  <br>of your practice and what you’ve got on <br>just today, before we start going back,  <br>just so we can get a sense of...<br>Sure, so we’re about 20 people  <br>and we are located — the 10th arrondissement <br>is an interesting arrondissement because  <br>it’s an area where there’s a huge mix of people. <br>It’s very close to the two train stations, one  <br>that’s linked into London and one that’s linked <br>into eastern Germany and Eastern Europe. We would  <br>be within about four minutes’ walk from those <br>train stations, so it’s in the north of Paris. <br>The office is located in an old atelier <br>that used to make cloth, which is  <br>in a northern area of Paris, sorry I <br>should say, just north of the centre.  <br>It was a very famous area for working — the <br>Garment District, really, the equivalent of  <br>New York. They were making a lot of clothing, <br>cheap clothing, that would go all over the world. <br>There’s still is remnants of that, but that’s <br>been over the last 10 years, architects,  <br>people in communication, designers have moved <br>into this area because it’s been cheap. That’s  <br>a thing of the past now, it’s no longer cheap. <br>It’s an area which has changed really radically  <br>since we’ve been here. But somehow, we’ve been <br>part of that and that’s another whole story, but  <br>our office is in the heart of that area.<br>Oh, wow. It sounds really interesting. I  <br>noticed this morning that Ledoux once built <br>a building on your street and of course,  <br>it’s been overbuilt since then.<br>Oh, that’s amazing, okay. <br>Yeah, anyway, in my introduction I rattled off <br>your itinerant years as an architect student,  <br>but maybe just indulge us, take us four decades <br>back to 1980/’81, when you started architecture  <br>before you headed to Sydney? What was <br>your experience at the Auckland school?  <br>I guess it was first year you were in or was there <br>an intermediate? How did that work, and what do  <br>you make of the atmosphere? Teaching, students, <br>teachers? What was that — do you have any …? <br>Well, I have a great memory of the atmosphere <br>and I’ve always referred to it as like a family,  <br>because it was an extraordinary period. Somehow, <br>the students seemed as interesting as the  <br>professors, and ‘interesting’ is maybe just not <br>the word. They almost seemed on an equivalent  <br>level, so when I talk about family <br>it was a kind of family that got on. <br>There was a sort of incredible, interesting spirit <br>in Auckland. I came from Dunedin and Wellington,  <br>and all of a sudden I found myself in this <br>— first of all, Auckland, just the light  <br>alone is an amazing city. It’s got this Pacific <br>light and for me it was discovering that,  <br>and light and colour, which have always been <br>fundamental for me. I think Auckland embodied that  <br>and I think that the people that were there at <br>that period of time certainly were — you know, it  <br>was the 80s, there was a lot going on culturally <br>around the world. You had incredible music scenes,  <br>you had a café scene that was just developing, <br>and those kind of memories, the people who were  <br>running that. One I lived in was in — what’s the <br>gully just north of Auckland University? I forget. <br>Grafton.<br>Grafton, thank you.  <br>It was within three minutes’ walk. It’s no <br>longer there, it’s demolished, but it was an old,  <br>rundown house with a huge veranda. It hadn’t <br>been painted in about 50/60 years and it was  <br>housing about eight Elam students. I took over <br>my bedroom from a lady called Elizabeth Farrelly— <br>[laughs]<br>—who of course has gone on and done extraordinary  <br>things as both a journalist and teacher etc in <br>Sydney, but she became a very good friend and  <br>that was my bedroom. I went into this whole milieu <br>of really amazing photographers, actors. There  <br>was the Foundry in Auckland, that was the core <br>part of the apartment, and there was of course  <br>the architecture part, which was a flag, one <br>flag, one room, which represented architecture. <br>So, that was, in a way, my incredible memories <br>of Auckland. Great creativity, and all of that  <br>of course was very much a part of — it was the <br>Elam, it was the Auckland Architecture School.  <br>Also it was downtown Auckland <br>and, as I said, the café scene.  <br>I think some very interesting people. So, a great <br>atmosphere. I have really great memories of that. <br>Yeah. Did you have drawing with Pat Hanly?<br>Absolutely. Pat Hanly was an extraordinary  <br>teacher. So of course, it was on these famous <br>expeditions where we would just leave the school  <br>and wander around into the parks, across the <br>bridge and into different areas of Auckland,  <br>and do his famous just ‘big idea’. That’s <br>of course, you know, the ‘big idea’ was  <br>you had a teacher able to encapsulate somehow into <br>a very simple phrase actually what he was doing,  <br>what in a way creativity is about. In a <br>sense, of course it wasn’t that simple,  <br>but I think he was a great teacher in that <br>way, because in a sense he made it accessible  <br>for everyone and generated an incredible <br>ambience. So I have great memories of Pat Hanly. <br>Oh, wonderful. Well, I guess we need to move on, <br>because in preparation for this conversation I  <br>discovered in our library, when I looked you up, <br>that we hold a catalogue from SCI-Arc from ’85  <br>called Desert Motel, which I think you were then <br>a design tutor for Thom Mayne? I’m sort of putting  <br>it together, you must correct me if I’m wrong.<br>Yeah. <br>In the School’s centenary year, our staff selected <br>some treasures from the library’s collection,  <br>and what came up tops was the Morphosis <br>catalogue edition by Peter Cook from ’85,  <br>and to realise that that’s where you took <br>yourself in the middle of the 80s, where so  <br>many desired to be. Can you tell us about the LA <br>years, SCI-Arc, and then working at Morphosis? <br>Yeah, it’s interesting. I discovered Morphosis <br>through going to Sydney, going to Australia,  <br>and then actually coming up with the kind of <br>wacky idea that it wasn’t necessarily going back  <br>to New Zealand but it was going on and exploring <br>the world, as well as continuing my education.  <br>So, I was sort of pre-Erasmus and I was doing <br>my own Erasmus, and in that sense that was  <br>really the reason why I wanted to leave Auckland, <br>continue on to Sydney. I had originally thought I  <br>would come back to Auckland, but then in Sydney <br>realised that it was interesting to move around  <br>and see if I could continue.<br>So, I went on into  <br>America and went around America and discovered <br>Los Angeles was actually one of the most amazing,  <br>creative cities at that point. There was a group <br>in Los Angeles, Morphosis was just one of them  <br>among other people, Frank, of course, being a <br>slightly older generation and then a younger group  <br>somehow around him. They were people <br>like Eric Moss, Robert Mangurian.  <br>I mean, it goes on. There was a list.<br>There was maybe about eight of them and  <br>all doing — or had just finished in the <br>last two or three years, extraordinary,  <br>what we call ‘case study’ houses, and they weren’t <br>the case study houses of the ‘60s and ‘70s,  <br>the Neutra and all of those, and Schindler that <br>we’ve come to know very well in beautiful photos.  <br>They were kind of a recent generation of <br>architects that had just got out of school and  <br>in a sense their first commissions were very tiny.<br>Morphosis of course, had built this thing called  <br>the 2-4-6-8 House. A lot of these additions were <br>in places like Venice Beach and Santa Monica, etc,  <br>and the 2-4-6-8 was the house built on top of the <br>garage, in the back of the house, on a midblock  <br>driveway. That was just one of a number of <br>additions that had been thrown up. When I saw  <br>those, because I went of course around Los Angeles <br>thinking it would be very interesting to come back  <br>to this city and do my education, I was just blown <br>away because it was a level of creativity which of  <br>course, I hadn’t seen anywhere else in the world.<br>For me, going to Los Angeles, in a strange way,  <br>I’ve always said it was like coming home, in <br>a weird way. It was the New Zealand suburb  <br>combined with a whole lot of other things. There’s <br>bits of Auckland in Los Angeles. There’s bits of  <br>Christchurch, from my childhood in a state house. <br>There’s a lot of things, but in a way, what I  <br>found in Los Angeles which interested me was in <br>a cinematic way, everything is exaggerated. The  <br>light is ten times as bright. Green grass doesn’t <br>look green, it looks positively mercurial... <br>Aha, it’s sort of green.<br>You know, and materials that were used  <br>in the ‘50s/’60s/’70s, very interesting, wacky, <br>mad materials and this idea of these strange,  <br>manicured gardens. Of course, all of the — let’s <br>say, the artists that were around capturing that.  <br>You had the artist like Ed Ruscha, who was <br>literally just photographing that and making  <br>these extraordinary publications. Then you had <br>other artists working in a way with the medium,  <br>going back into the medium of light, and of <br>course that whole generation of light artists  <br>that were capturing a kind of abstraction, <br>like Robert Irwin or James Turrell. <br>So, all of a sudden, I found in Los Angeles <br>there was this extraordinary artistic,  <br>architectural — a very, very rich <br>scene, and it was a scene that very much  <br>was, I think, already exploring things that I was <br>very much interested in myself. I mean, growing  <br>up in New Zealand, for me Los Angeles, as I said, <br>was just a continuity of this suburbia and that’s  <br>always been really interesting to me. I’ve never <br>seen it as something negative. I’ve always seen it  <br>as something actually very beautiful.<br>Absolutely. <br>So, that in a sense, Los Angeles then — you <br>know, just getting to the SCI-Arc thing,  <br>my discoveries of SCI-Arc was driving around, <br>being told that I had to go and visit this wacky  <br>school down in Santa Monica, which I did and <br>I arrived in this carpark and there was this  <br>shed from the 1940s that had been used to build <br>military aircraft. I walked in and inside was  <br>scaffolding, and all of these levels on which <br>students were working away inside all of this  <br>scaffolding/wood construction, and in the middle <br>of it all there was a basketball game going on.  <br>I thought, hang on, I’m in the wrong <br>place. This is not an architecture school. <br>Of course, it was. It was the hub, the basketball <br>— of course, when I say ‘of course’, one found all  <br>of this out, but of course, they would take the <br>net down. The basketball court really was the  <br>general assembly space. All of the lectures would <br>go on there, as well as all sorts of other stuff.  <br>I found myself in this extraordinary <br>environment with about 30 other students,  <br>who were living in the school. I had no money <br>and of course, I stayed on and lived in this  <br>scaffolding-structure-come-whatever, a ruche... <br>hive, for at least a year and a half/two years  <br>until I could get myself settled. But that was <br>great. That was exactly what I was looking for. <br>So exciting, and then you moved onto Harvard GSD?  <br>That was kind of finishing school, I presume, <br>for all the experimentation and moving on.  <br>What did you do there? What was <br>your thesis? What did you do? <br>Yeah, absolutely. It is interesting because <br>you couldn’t be two things more extreme. <br>Yeah.<br>Your experimental, wacky — a school  <br>that didn’t even have a certificate recognised by <br>the State of California. We all went through this  <br>thing. It was mad, it was started in the 1960s by <br>a bunch of hippies. Then you have Harvard, which  <br>of course is the absolutely opposite of that. So <br>in a sense, it was culture shock and in a sense,  <br>it was interesting to do for somehow that reason, <br>because what happened at Harvard was that I saw  <br>all the stuff that I probably never saw in Los <br>Angeles, and all the stuff that I was probably  <br>not meant to see or would see later in <br>Europe, and so Harvard for me was like Europe.  <br>It’s very European, the East Coast. It’s <br>extremely influenced by all the history of Europe. <br>I’ve always made this joke in terms of — I <br>came across this word called — or someone  <br>at school at Harvard said, ‘Yeah, it’s <br>very nice, but what’s your precedent?’  <br>I thought, What the hell is a precedent? It <br>was a word I’d never come across in my life. <br>Oh, really?<br>[laughs] <br>Oh, goodness.<br>It was like I was  <br>tortured. First of all I thought it was <br>‘president’. I thought, Well, hang on,  <br>who’s my president? We don’t have presidents <br>in New Zealand. We have prime ministers. <br>Oh, wow.<br>Of course, realising  <br>that that is the East Coast. That’s very much <br>the story of, ‘Okay, we like the idea, but  <br>intellectually where are you coming from? What’s <br>the background? What’s behind you? What’s before  <br>you?’ That was a complete wake up call, which <br>I had absolutely not discussed in California.  <br>California’s about forward moving and then, of <br>course, I’m saying that for me as a personal  <br>experience. I’m not going to generalise. I don’t <br>really want to go there, but as an experience,  <br>it was absolutely a very different experience.<br>But the thesis was a good question, and I  <br>wanted to do — well, I didn’t know in fact what I <br>wanted to do. It was very interesting. I’m telling  <br>you I chose one thesis which I really wanted to <br>do and I couldn’t do it, and I ended up doing the  <br>other which I was interested but it probably <br>wasn’t as strong and powerful as the first. <br>The first was that because I had spent time in <br>Australia, I was extremely interested and I’d  <br>gone and visited Tasmania, and I’ve always been <br>interested in this issue of traces, histories,  <br>things that have come before me, ironically. <br>Not precedents, but you know. In a way, stuff  <br>that’s there, but maybe not there, but <br>needs to be pulled out and made apparent.  <br>The thing that attracted me a lot to Australia was <br>of course the ancient civilisation, which was the  <br>Aboriginal, but of course, while saying ‘ancient’, <br>it’s a living thing. Tasmania interested me,  <br>trying to do a project there, but at the same time <br>I was very much interested in this idea of layers. <br>So, I found a subject which I thought was <br>very interesting, went to work on a prison  <br>colony for women that was just south of Hobart. <br>I went and visited, and I did all the research,  <br>and it was basically Aboriginal women, and men, <br>but essentially women and children that had been  <br>taken away from their homelands or their villages <br>etc, because they’ve been put into this holding  <br>camp. When I say ‘prison’, it was sort of a <br>prison/holding camp, etc. A pretty sad story.  <br>I mean, a kind of a shocking story. They were <br>put inside this new town, south of Hobart,  <br>which is no longer there. It’s non-existing.<br>What I found was the town, the plans, the  <br>description of the place, which was very powerful, <br>and some of the people that had gone through  <br>there, and I gathered all of that together and <br>actually went down to Tasmania and interviewed,  <br>or tried to interview, some family that had <br>descendants and realised that I was coming up  <br>against a block. They didn’t want me to go further <br>with the project and that was an amazing moment.  <br>It was essentially tapu land for them and the <br>subject was very, very powerful and I think they  <br>really did not want anyone to open the thing up at <br>that point. They wanted to open it up themselves. <br>That was a very powerful moment because I came <br>back to Sydney and I was thinking, what the hell  <br>am I going to do? I sort of put myself up <br>against this thing, up against some pretty  <br>powerful feelings, powerful forces, and I <br>understood it and I didn’t understand it.  <br>There was a lot that I never understood.<br>Then, of course, one asks oneself, yes,  <br>but is it even the role of an architect to get <br>oneself involved in that situation? Can you put  <br>yourself in that situation? Should other people <br>really be the ones that put you in it and you go  <br>into it having been invited? I mean, there’s <br>a lot of subject matter there, just in terms  <br>of what the role of an architect is. What their <br>role that they think it is. Is there even moments  <br>when in fact you should not even be involved <br>in projects as architects? Yes, of course.  <br>The answer’s yes, of course. That’s a biggie.<br>Anyway, that was a very interesting experience.  <br>From that, I jumped back and decided on the <br>Bondi Surf Club, which is absolutely somehow  <br>another extreme of Australian culture.<br>Well, it sounds like a thesis student  <br>situation we have as well, students not <br>knowing what they want to do and then  <br>having so many ideas, and them getting very <br>desperate. It’s an old story and a new story. <br>It’s an old story and a new story. Harvard was <br>an extraordinary — Michael Hays was my thesis  <br>advisor. I mean, I couldn’t have had better <br>people. It was an extraordinary period,  <br>so I can’t say much more. It really in <br>fact is what got me to Europe after that. <br>Yeah, because then you headed to London, <br>I understand, for a brief period before  <br>you moved onto Paris. I guess, we need to start <br>looking at your work very soon, but if you could,  <br>just a few comments around the issue <br>of Paris when you arrive? I mean,  <br>the early days of a time of La Fondation Cartier <br>by Jean Nouvel and the Bibliothèque nationale  <br>project was being built by Dominique Perrault, <br>and I guess Christian De Portzamparc and the Citè  <br>De La Musique. Did any of that interest — that’s <br>all now far from Tasmania and your other topics,  <br>it’s hard to imagine that could’ve attracted you.<br>It’s really interesting what you’re saying. In  <br>many ways, it didn’t. I’ve always found Nouvel’s <br>work very good, and it’s exceptional work.  <br>I found a lot of those big projects, though, big. <br>I saw them as presidential projects, handed down  <br>in a very hierarchical system. Somehow, I didn’t <br>feel myself as part of that at all. In fact,  <br>I wasn’t, or Dominique and I weren’t, because <br>what we were literally experiencing was  <br>all of that, that whole generation, was a <br>moment in time. Our generation that came after,  <br>or a number of generations after that, there was <br>no more money. There was no more presidential  <br>decrees of these extraordinary...<br>Le Grand Projet? <br>Yeah, le Grand Projet. I mean, I think I <br>found myself closer to people like Bernard  <br>Tschumi’s la Villette project, of course, and <br>I’ve always thought the failed projects — ‘failed’  <br>is not the word. The ones that lost, like <br>Koolhaas’ library. I’ve always thought, what a  <br>wonderful, incredible project that would’ve been.<br>So, what we’ve tended to have chosen and what  <br>we’ve built as opposed to what actually we <br>could’ve created or built in Paris, that’s  <br>an ongoing story. In that sense, it’s a city <br>of dreams and realities, and the realities have  <br>often shifted towards more monumental projects <br>that served a more political purpose, of course.  <br>Probably more simple and very direct messages to <br>the public space, but not necessarily the best. <br>So, those things have happened and obviously <br>what you’ve been seeing now in the last 20 years  <br>in France, anyway, or certainly in Paris, has been <br>absolutely the opposite projects. They’ve been  <br>projects concentrating on rebuilding or additions, <br>subtractions, transformations. All of those kind  <br>of key words to do with existing conditions. <br>It’s not on a kind of theoretical level, it’s  <br>really literally almost a what was then possible. <br>The boom happened, no longer was the money there  <br>and the culture for these big, big competitions, <br>which France was very famous for. But of course,  <br>now it’s more about much more lower key — you <br>know, you’ve been following the work, I’m sure. <br>Yeah, well, we do need to see your work, so I need <br>to just say that, of course, it’s an old story,  <br>but it’s a great story. You know, you’re beginning <br>with a break out project with Dominique, the  <br>radical intervention on the top floor of the <br>Centre Pompidou for a restaurant, and you were  <br>handpicked for the job, I understand? You’d <br>already been looked at for other work as well,  <br>and you delivered something, some very exceptional <br>forms. I guess I would say, they were called  <br>‘deforms’, and at least that’s how you like to <br>call them, and their intense colours and light  <br>in the Piano and Rogers skeleton.<br>I don’t really see Morphosis in Paris here,  <br>I don’t think, but were you channelling things <br>like, I don’t know, Le Corbusier sculpture  <br>or the sculpture of André Bloc? I understand <br>you had a naval architect involved in the design  <br>execution, and that may have got you hooked <br>onto the digital — you know, we’d like to hear.  <br>Anyway, just if you could tell us how this <br>project and of course, we’ll move onto  <br>the next projects very soon <br>to delve into your oeuvre. <br>Okay, great. So Michael, on this image here, you <br>can see we’re on a terrace outside and you see  <br>above all of the structure, let’s call it the <br>‘charpent’, the trusses, all of the air ducts,  <br>all of that, and Pompidou’s blue. If you <br>look up above that you have these big blue  <br>chimneys bringing air out or in, mostly out, <br>at the top of the building. So, it’s Pompidou  <br>exteriorised, exoskeleton, exo-everything. <br>Then on the inside, of course, you had  <br>this incredible — you still have this <br>incredible tubular system of electricity,  <br>water, plumbing coming in from the roof.<br>We were given this space, 900m2 on the inside, it  <br>was a big rectangle, and we were in a competition. <br>Our competition was quite tough. Philippe Starck  <br>was our major competitor, and I think Pompidou <br>basically said, ‘If the young generation fails,  <br>we have our key man ready,’ and we were tortured. <br>We thought, well, obviously, they want Philippe.  <br>They don’t really want the youngies, but they’ve <br>got the youngies in anyway. So, we were about  <br>five groups, and Dominique and I, really in <br>a sense we only had this is the one project  <br>in the office at that moment, so in a sense we <br>gave to it, I guess, everything that we had,  <br>which probably shows I think, in the final piece.<br>Anyway, the point is that this is an aluminium  <br>floor and all of these four volumes pop out of <br>that aluminium and become these different spaces.  <br>The bar is this tubular thing just to the right. <br>So, this is kind of the one, and then the kitchen  <br>is in the middle, and then we have another spaces <br>like bathrooms and VIP space in the back. Anyway,  <br>the point is that this guy is — it was done in <br>aluminium because we have to be very, very light.  <br>We only had 500kg maximum, because Piano’s project <br>is a steel building, it moves 14cm during the day,  <br>so the whole thing is on — all of these volumes <br>are on car springs, like the springs between  <br>the chassis and the wheels. We have tons <br>of springs under each of these volumes,  <br>just to take into account the shift <br>of the building throughout the day. <br>It’s all hidden, essentially seamless, but it’s <br>a project which — it’s a restaurant now in its  <br>21st year of its existence. All of the furniture <br>was designed by us with Cappellini out at Milan.  <br>The lighting was iGuzzini, again working with <br>two great Italian manufacturers we designed  <br>both aspects. The lighting in this case, <br>we’re not designers, we’re architects,  <br>and our approach to a lot of those kinds of <br>things like design, we tend to play it down.  <br>We’re not interested in playing up this stuff. For <br>us, it comes from architectural ideas. It doesn’t  <br>just come out of a design world, but that’s our <br>angle and the angle is the angle of an architect. <br>The inside of these volumes is in rubber, <br>made out of an organic latex rubber from Asia,  <br>that was started by a company out in the <br>Loire Valley and they’re still going strong.  <br>We’re in a project which is still going very, very <br>strong. It has an extraordinary existence and no,  <br>it’s something which we were very, very <br>proud to work on. We occasionally go back  <br>for dinner. Piano celebrates his birthday there <br>every year, so we think that’s a fairly good sign. <br>Yeah, I would imagine so.<br>Among other things. <br>Indeed, oh wonderful. Shall we go onto the <br>next work, maybe? After the Pont-Audemer  <br>theatre and the Renault Communication Center <br>projects where you installed work again in  <br>a pre-existing building. We don’t have time <br>unfortunately — they’re so interesting, but  <br>you started to win competitions and notably you <br>started with this massive Confluence development  <br>project area in Lyon, right?<br>Yeah. <br>Eventually so many of the big names were built, <br>Herzog &amp; de Meuron and Coop Himmelb(l)au,  <br>of course, the big museum at the very apex <br>of — well, the confluence of the rivers,  <br>and Tatiana Bilbao and Kengo Kuma, etc. But these <br>blocks, you know, they were between a railyard,  <br>as I understand it, and this embankment, right?<br>Yeah, that’s right, and  <br>essentially the block represents the buildable <br>space and we’ve always been very interested in  <br>this idea of building to the limit, or let’s say, <br>materialising the limit and then working with that  <br>as a kind of conceptual frame. In the Orange Cube <br>and the Green Cube, that’s absolutely the case.  <br>We can go as high, we can go as wide in all the <br>senses. Then after that, of course, it became  <br>a deduction of what we could do in terms <br>of the voids. The voids really come  <br>out of that fight, let’s call it, between a <br>limit and then the limit of the programme,  <br>what was given to us, what they needed.<br>But it was an interesting competition because  <br>the city started this competition. We were about, <br>as you say, four winners of a whole series of  <br>sites. We won two of the sites and then we spent <br>two or three years looking, along with the city,  <br>for a client to essentially buy the site and build <br>the project. So, it was one of these new ways of  <br>running a competition without a client, and then <br>finding the client afterwards, which in a way,  <br>we’ve always been asked what’s better or <br>worse. There’s no good answer to this question. <br>I think, sure, we had a freedom to imagine these <br>things as two, as opposed to one, so of course we  <br>became very interested in this idea of a city <br>of replication and iterance and difference,  <br>but using the same system, so that’s why there’s <br>two pieces. They’re like a family of pieces. We’ve  <br>always been asked, ‘Where the hell is the third <br>piece?’ Well, we didn’t win three. We won two. <br>We’ve always been interested in this idea of <br>a kind of city which you could wander across  <br>and actually see pieces that had a dialogue, a <br>conversation, were part of a discourse. I think  <br>to me the only place in the world where I’ve found <br>that, certainly the historical precedent has been,  <br>in a number of projects in Rome, including <br>of course the Four Seasons Bernini fountain.  <br>Where you have this project for an experience in <br>public space that touches a number of different  <br>sites, but it’s been conceived to dialogue or <br>discourse across those sites, Rome has them,  <br>as I said two or three times and they’re <br>extraordinary experiences. I think that’s  <br>something we very much were influenced by, <br>so it has ironically a Renaissance origin. <br>But other than that, it’s a project for offices <br>at the top. It’s cultural, for the first layer.  <br>Yeah, the blocks are right — you can see the <br>river, it’s an extraordinary river here. Just  <br>on the opposite side is really a kind of urban <br>forest that has old villas and an old hospital  <br>inside of them. So, the view out from the building <br>onto those is amazing, and onto the river.<br>So, the idea of doing these cones, of course, was <br>to make a big wind — profit from that negative  <br>space and make it a collective void space where <br>people could come onto their balconies from each  <br>layer, so each layer has a different type of <br>office. They could come onto them, but they aren’t  <br>heavily used, these spaces. A number of years ago <br>we talked about them as almost break out spaces,  <br>but I think that’s a kind of pejorative term. <br>I would say they’re great spaces for barbecues,  <br>they’re great spaces for people <br>to meet, to talk, to do meetings.  <br>Lyon has a sort of microclimate of its own, <br>even in winter, so they’re very useful spaces.<br>As you said, the oculus goes through <br>the building, and what’s interesting  <br>here is that none of this is done for, let’s <br>say, just a spatial gesture. It also has a  <br>really interesting impact on the climate of the <br>building. This is a chimney, so air naturally  <br>comes down the river and up through the chimney. <br>We were able to do all of that with air studies,  <br>to prove that you could open windows on the <br>insides of this chimney and the oculus and get  <br>air moving sufficiently through the building <br>in summertime to cool the building down.<br>Then, of course, the orange stuff on <br>the outside is a layer which keeps  <br>the light/sun impact on the building. It <br>reduces it radically, so it’s a perforated layer  <br>and it’s a layer of tiny pixels, but <br>faceted pixels, very much like the big cone. <br>Yeah, so this is more about heritage <br>I suppose, in that it seems to me that  <br>while your first project was obviously in a <br>heritage-protected interior, the first major  <br>project for Georges there. Then since then, you’ve <br>done some very remarkable interiors for Florence  <br>Loewy, Fondation Ricard and the Frederic Malle <br>perfumery right in the centre of town in Paris.<br>You’ve generated forms through deformation <br>and dissipation of these kind of  <br>reticulated surfaces that you found as a surface <br>with the Centre Pompidou, but then eventually you  <br>were working with three dimensional grids and <br>then deforming within that grid. This must be  <br>the most important project and certainly the <br>one you’re best known for, the FRAC in Orléans,  <br>and then of course, just before <br>that the Dock project in Paris.<br>Maybe you could just tell us how — of course, <br>heritage and working with older buildings has  <br>been around as long as architecture has, but how <br>has your practice moved on, as I think it has  <br>from the images at least, on the heritage <br>— dealing with heritage and those contents? <br>I think we’ve always been interested <br>in history. The FRAC, as you can see,  <br>the building on the left hand and just in <br>the back, it’s all what they call the …  <br>what would they call it?<br>A riddle. <br>It’s basically a food production building <br>where foodstuffs were produced for the military  <br>in the 19th and 20th century. So, <br>that was already an extraordinarily  <br>strange aspect, right in the heart of Orléans. <br>So, you have these three Perspex images  <br>of the building here is the old building that <br>exists, and what we did essentially was to take  <br>the two histories. As you said, we have an <br>18th century, we have a 19th century history,  <br>they don’t come together. The site comes together <br>as two different histories, two different building  <br>moments on its site. The site also, I need to say, <br>is like a lot of things in Europe, there’s layers.  <br>As everyone knows, there’s layers on the site. <br>Underneath the site is a 16th century convent.  <br>Along on the left hand side <br>is what we call [inaudible],  <br>which essentially is like the periphery of the <br>Middle Ages city, which had a wall here that  <br>was destroyed in the industrial revolution, so <br>that’s what gives it the strong cut line. So, we  <br>just have this stuff that we’ve got to work with.<br>But the most interesting immediate thing was that  <br>our project really had to take place on the <br>inside between these two histories, and we  <br>knew that we were very interested in the land and <br>the land form of that site and its history. So,  <br>working with both sites, we’re often interested — <br>and that is something which really hasn’t changed,  <br>Michael, is that we’re very interested in often <br>going into the geometry of the projects that has  <br>nothing to do with the language of the immediate, <br>let’s say, architectural or building language.  <br>How it’s made, what it’s made out of, and <br>just in a sense how it’s developed as a  <br>language. It’s got nothing to do with that, <br>it’s really more to do with the geometry  <br>of how the thing is structured and the structuring <br>system. In this case we had two structuring  <br>systems, we had the 18th and the 19th century. <br>In working with them, we realised that the entry  <br>could possibly become this kind of confluence.<br>The project is called The Turbulence, and The  <br>Turbulence for us was a very interesting metaphor <br>because it was a place in which these two grids,  <br>two histories, could come together to create a <br>third condition, the third condition being a way  <br>then into it, entering, going through a doorway, <br>essentially as you see in this image here.  <br>In a way, those structuring grids are brought up, <br>they’re deformed from a concrete up through into a  <br>metallic surface, and this is a kind of wood layer <br>on the inside, which you see in the other image,  <br>and all of this is kind of going up, getting <br>light in, and creating also very interesting  <br>scenographic spaces, spaces which we’ve done …<br>Of course the FRAC has been  <br>exemplary in the world in terms of running <br>a very important biennale of architecture,  <br>which you guys would be, I’m sure, <br>well aware of over the years.  <br>It was really one of the first digital biennales <br>in the world, and so the base has seen a lot of  <br>different exhibitions, a lot of really amazing <br>stuff. But this really for us was like a tent,  <br>and it was a tent of a kind of entry that gave us <br>a way in to this stuff, and this stuff, of course,  <br>is the orthogonal, it’s the old, we’re in the 18th <br>century part here, which actually was the food,  <br>stoves, kind of the major factory part, which of <br>course you couldn’t tell that it was that today. <br>Anyway, the point is that our approach hasn’t <br>really changed. I would say it’s an ongoing  <br>interest in working with the structure and the <br>geometry of heritage pieces, as you say, and  <br>then trying to find a way in which the story can <br>come together. In this case, it was two stories,  <br>two stories coming together to create a third, and <br>the third being The Turbulence. Not unlike an air  <br>condition for an aircraft. The Turbulence in this <br>case was of course a nice metaphor for creativity  <br>and ideas coming together, and challenges, <br>etc, which the FRAC is absolutely on the  <br>forefront of that.<br>Yeah, and then … <br>And this, yeah.<br>And then this. <br>You’re right. So, this thing is again <br>heritage. This is the old docks of Paris,  <br>1907, designed by an engineer not an architect. <br>Went to Chicago, studied in the Chicago school,  <br>came back to France, studied steel construction. <br>You guys, you know some of the great architects in  <br>the period of the Chicago school – Sullivan, <br>all of these kinds of people – that were  <br>doing some amazing stuff, but essentially <br>steel was their major building material.  <br>So, this engineer was studying the steel, <br>thinking that he would come back to France and  <br>actually bring the steel as an architectural or an <br>engineering — what he was learning then, he would  <br>bring back to France and propose new structures.<br>Well, it’s very interesting, when he got back to  <br>France actually he saw another revolution <br>happening in France, which was concrete and  <br>totally the opposite of what had been going on <br>in Chicago, and he jumped. He made this jump  <br>into concrete, from what we understand. <br>Auguste Perret was also at that same period  <br>very interested in concrete, but in a different <br>way. He was the architect, this was engineer,  <br>and the commission here was to design a building, <br>probably about three times as long as this one –  <br>and what you see below here is just the concrete, <br>of course, the concrete structure – that became  <br>the docks of Paris, this big, industrial facility.<br>We were given the commission after an  <br>international competition. Our project we called <br>The Plug-Over. The Plug-Over is again absolutely  <br>born out of all of this heritage condition. <br>Both, I would say, are geometrical for sure,  <br>but for all sorts of other reasons. Of <br>course, it’s the influence of the river  <br>and the movement of the river. It’s a lot of <br>things. It’s this idea of bringing a condition  <br>exploring the fifth side, the fifth <br>façade in a city of a landscape condition,  <br>which we found on top of the old building.<br>So anyway, in this case we took that precedent  <br>and we – talking of precedents – and we pushed <br>it up one floor, which were allowed to, and we  <br>created this thing called the Plug-Over. So, the <br>Plug-Over is plugged over something that exists,  <br>and it’s absolutely very much a very <br>visual addition to an existing thing,  <br>and I would say it’s very much about that <br>next generation after le grande project,  <br>the big projects, this is much more about one <br>which says, ‘No, we’re not demolishing, we’re  <br>keeping.’ We did have an opportunity with the city <br>of Paris, they told us, ‘You can get rid of it.’  <br>Of course we thought it was a total crime. Yes, <br>we would have done it 30 years ago probably,  <br>but we recognised the importance of keeping the <br>structure way before this idea of resilience  <br>has been talked about. Also it’s a precedent, <br>because it proposes using the top surface of the  <br>city as a new landscape. So, there’s a number of <br>important aspects about the project that came up  <br>and we think have become kind of like precedents <br>for other project now, for other people. <br>Yeah, indeed. I think we have <br>to move on, I’m afraid. Oh yeah,  <br>images of the roof and the river wall, lovely.<br>Now recently you’ve had two pretty  <br>interesting — oh sorry. Your parfumerie <br>Frederic Malle. We were gonna move on to the  <br>C40 Reinventing Cities competition wins, this <br>one in Saint-Denis and the one in Reykjavik.  <br>Maybe if you could just give a couple of minutes <br>on this because we’ve got a couple more topics  <br>to go and we’re supposed to wrap up in about—<br>I know, exactly. I’ll try and make it speed up a  <br>bit. Pleyel is north of Paris. Again it’s kind of <br>plug-in or plug-over, but in a sense what it is,  <br>is called the Energy Plug in this case. Our <br>client was EDF, which is the electricity  <br>company in France, and it was trying to create <br>an alternative new vision for an industrial  <br>building, which had housed turbine cleaning <br>equipment, basically to do with the electrical  <br>industry from the 1930s, now abandoned in the <br>north of Paris, an extraordinary building which  <br>they call The Cathedral on the inside. Our winning <br>project really, was proposing a wooden structure,  <br>entirely wood with some concrete within <br>it, essentially as this kind of a new  <br>centre – social centre, arts centre. <br>It has in the back a growing wall  <br>for food production. It has a strong associate <br>of connectivity with the neighbourhood. <br>I’ll just go through some images of that. So, it <br>gives you an idea of, in a sense, its language.  <br>Its language again comes very much out of the <br>condition and existing geometrical condition.  <br>But you have the art deco concrete thing on the <br>right, and then you have us with our emerging new  <br>world piece, which is both an energy <br>roof, in the back we have, of course,  <br>this vertical farming piece which we’ve <br>been developing, so it’s the energy plug. <br>Then I would go on and talk about another project, <br>which was also for the C40 competition. It’s in  <br>Reykjavik and it’s housing. It’s called Living <br>Landscape. It’s housing built around a landscape,  <br>essentially of forest, so that it gives a huge <br>number of people this idea of living in the urban  <br>situation but living in an ecological structure. <br>It’s Iceland’s biggest wood building ever built.  <br>It’s not under construction yet; we hope it will <br>be. Essentially it’s these layers coming together,  <br>the rooftop has a series of communal glasshouses. <br>Essentially, giving you some idea of the planning,  <br>we have students in there, we have older people, <br>so it’s a lot of mixity of different groups.  <br>This is part of a model which we’ve been building <br>for Seoul, which we touched on as a point. So  <br>that’s now delivered and will be opening, I <br>think, in the next couple of days in Seoul… <br>Oh brilliant.<br>… as the biennale of Seoul,  <br>which we’re very excited to be involved in.<br>Indeed, and, yes, thank you for this prompt here,  <br>the Maison Connectée. I’ll just say <br>that it is such an astonishing form.  <br>I’m saying here that is has a kind of figurative <br>quality, rather like a body I suppose you could  <br>say, and it strikes me too that maybe — you <br>know, you say you work in a former textile  <br>industry space around couturier, and I’m wondering <br>here whether you’re kind of draping the body of  <br>the building in something like a Rick Owens cape <br>of triangulated mesh steel, etc. I guess I’d  <br>just say that it looks like a building that’s <br>being presented to the public like a figure,  <br>to take its public role in the city as a body, I <br>guess I could say. Maybe just tell us a little bit  <br>about it before we move on to the last questions.<br>Yeah, it’s interesting. I think the thing is,  <br>if you look in this plan view, what we <br>have inside is actually a highly orthogonal  <br>structure. We have that because we’re dealing <br>with basically also a house which has five floors,  <br>but a number of those floors have a lot of rooms, <br>which are highly orthogonal in their planning,  <br>and of course all of that loading as a <br>structure comes down into the basement,  <br>which is also quite orthogonal, ironically. What <br>is interesting is that orthogonal condition,  <br>when it comes to the edge, connects <br>through to another layer, as you say.  <br>What is important, though, is that other layer <br>is informed by that orthogonal condition as it  <br>comes to the outside. In other words, a <br>little bit different from the piece by  <br>Rick Owens, which, let’s say, would take the <br>body and, as you say, drapes around the body. <br>In this case the body becomes the drape. If one <br>plays back the skin, in a sense, of the outside,  <br>one actually comes back into these tubes – <br>for example these tubes are all structural  <br>tubes – that go right through the building, and <br>they hold on top of it each floor. It’s a total  <br>body, so you do have an effect of a double layer, <br>for all sorts of reasons. The neighbours did not  <br>want to be looked at and so we have these very <br>acute views. Also the guys living inside did  <br>not also want to look straight onto the garden <br>of someone, so there was urban rules that we  <br>had to work with on the sides. It’s interesting, <br>it’s built within the memory of an older building  <br>which the clients demolished before we got <br>to the site, which was a wooden Swiss chalet,  <br>and ironically it had a peaked roof and the only <br>reason we could build on this site is because we  <br>had that building envelope there.<br>Grandfather. <br>So anyway, coming from all of that, it describes <br>why we are working with a condition which is a  <br>kind of a three-dimensional — it’s much <br>more complex; it’s a three-dimensional  <br>thing. Although it may have this layering <br>– it is a layer – and there’s a void here,  <br>and then there’s another layer, it’s very much a <br>three-dimensional thing. As you can see down here,  <br>this is the last floor before the underground and <br>again this condition of a kind of a Voronoi, let’s  <br>say, structure, as it comes into that level down <br>below, again it hooks back into a larger rectangle  <br>below the building. These are some conditions that <br>I wanted to pop into … It’s a little bit maybe  <br>related to the language of this — essentially it’s <br>based around the metaphor of a tree, the house,  <br>and it rises up through the building, so you’ve <br>got layers and you’ve got rings, and that outer  <br>ring is the layer that you’re referring to.<br>Well, this is your Aedes Exhibition work,  <br>isn’t it?<br>Yeah. <br>I was wondering whether maybe we need to move <br>on to the Tonga Above project and then wrap up.  <br>It’s rather sad, we’ve had a question in the <br>chat on working with artists, and I had hoped  <br>that we would talk about that. Maybe we can <br>just for a minute at the end. But can you talk  <br>to the Tonga Above project and show us that?<br>Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I can do all of  <br>it quite fast.<br>Super. <br>This is an image of my partner <br>Dominique on the left hand side.  <br>The thing floating in the foreground is a drawing <br>in augmented reality, which is actually a moving  <br>film showing the conceptual way in which those <br>cones came into the Cube, the Orange Cube,  <br>and so it’s a film that tells a story, but <br>it’s invisible. You have to have an app  <br>to see it and through a screen. So, that <br>touches on an issue to do with the ongoing  <br>experimentation, a lot having to do with what you <br>don’t see – we’re very interested in this area.  <br>Some of the design work we’ve been doing <br>was a bottle that we did for Ricard. <br>This is Tonga, and again I’ll touch on the <br>very … Tonga is, like many of the islands in  <br>the Pacific are undergoing rising water levels <br>and also storms. So, there’s two major forces  <br>on the island of Tonga. We think the capital <br>is going to be inundated in the future. So,  <br>our project is a theoretical project that we’ve <br>been developing with a local Tongan artist  <br>to reimagine the Tonga of the future, and so <br>this is what we’ll be proposing. These images  <br>are really a tiny amount of what we’ll be showing, <br>so it doesn’t really very well present the project  <br>here, and again I’m just focusing on a tiny piece <br>of that. It’s a coming together of two things. One  <br>is the interest of coral formation and how that <br>can be an extraordinary way in which to build up  <br>a new city off and existing marine condition, both <br>a structural thing and also taking from nature,  <br>the way nature approaches making these kinds of <br>structures. We’re going out, of course, cos we’re  <br>trying to bring up, grow away from that rising <br>water, and also becoming a stronger structure  <br>to do with fighting against those storms, so these <br>are some of the images that we’ve been developing. <br>So I think that’s kind of — I’m finishing <br>there quickly, in order to give over the talk. <br>Oh well, thank you. We have had a question, as I <br>said, about working with artists, and I am aware  <br>that you have worked with artists on a number <br>of projects. Maybe if you could just answer  <br>about that in general with respect to some <br>of your other works, to give a sense of  <br>how you’ve worked with them and they’ve <br>taken your ideas and added to it. I  <br>did a have question around ornamentalism <br>and your work, but this might suffice. <br>Maybe I just don’t show you the image cos you’ve <br>seen it, but there’s Euronews, remember the green  <br>project from the outside?<br>Yes. <br>It’s a good example of working with artists. We <br>have a really strong interest in the art world.  <br>We always have had. For us, we’re very interested <br>in working with artists at the very beginnings of  <br>projects, not at the end. Sometimes they’ve come <br>in at the end just because historically that’s  <br>how it’s developed. Fabrice Hyber, a very famous <br>French artist, was very much responsible for  <br>let’s say the tattooing or the perforating of <br>the green project. We had a methodology that  <br>we developed for the orange project, but then <br>with Fabrice we said, ‘Okay, it’s yours. You  <br>work with this surface if your concept is <br>something which you’re —’ His concept was  <br>originally something to do with obviously water <br>and sound, and the piece is called Les Ondes,  <br>which again it’s an invisible <br>thing, it’s the soundwaves. <br>He took that and we worked closely with <br>Fabrice. He went through a series of sketches,  <br>I haven’t had time, cos that’s another whole body <br>of material, just to talk about artists, but we  <br>have some fantastic sketches of Fabrice where he <br>took us through this imaginary world of sound and  <br>also water. So, he was trying to make the story <br>of the river, and he was trying to make the story  <br>of soundwaves. So, the two are one thing, and <br>the façade with Fabrice is something we spent  <br>a huge amount of time ping-ponging backwards and <br>forwards with him on that. So, it’s interesting. <br>Our work with an artist isn’t necessarily <br>to say, ‘Okay, you do it.’ Trying to answer  <br>the question there from your audience. We’re <br>very much interested in saying, ‘No, hang on,  <br>there’s something we’ve done,’ and we would like <br>it to be more like a ping-pong. In this case with  <br>Fabrice it was absolutely that. We got to <br>the point where it’s kind of like a hand  <br>and glove. Yes, the building’s a Jakob-MacFarlane <br>building, but then actually there’s the work of  <br>Fabrice Hyber, and you guys should look into his <br>work, it’s extraordinary work. He brings another  <br>whole realm which we could never have done on that <br>project. I think it’s that kind of dialogue which  <br>can give incredible resonance to a work. You look <br>at it, you think, hang on, what’s going on here?  <br>There’s depth, there’s … where is that? Of course, <br>if you’re working with another person that’s  <br>outside of what you’re doing, invariably I think <br>something will be richer and more interesting. So,  <br>that’s been our philosophy when working <br>with artists. We’ve worked with a bunch of  <br>very well-known French artists essentially.<br>Well, it was just lovely to see the night  <br>images of the FRAC with the Electronic Shadow <br>group working and pumping in data from weather  <br>and traffic. So exciting. Building <br>just isn’t another building, isn’t it? <br>Well that was with a group called Electronic <br>Shadows, and they were amazing because they came  <br>with a drawing. Again it went out, we said, <br>‘Listen, this is what we’re working with  <br>as a form, as a surface, and the story of the <br>two grids coming together.’ They went away,  <br>they came back, and a week later they came <br>to our office and showed us a drawing,  <br>and it has a point, a line, and a surface. They <br>had a whole discourse about how the origins of  <br>architectural representation could be taken back <br>into the surface, and if they coupled that with  <br>live data, which diffracts electronic surfaces, <br>as coupled with meteorological conditions over  <br>the city of Orléans, so we have live contextual <br>data with this principle of a point-line surface.  <br>That’s what creates this beast, and it’s <br>a beast that, through an algorithmic  <br>base and a server within the FRAC, creates <br>unique pieces, and they’re never the same. <br>Brendan, thank you so much. We’ve ended with <br>some lovely, interesting collaborative work  <br>that I know you’re doing and continue to do, and <br>there were questions around what’s next and some  <br>thoughts about your work in general, but we have <br>to leave them I guess. Thankfully, you did answer  <br>some questions around — we got around your working <br>by the water and was there some way in which your  <br>work responded to that. You’ve actually answered <br>that question for one of the people querying that,  <br>so that’s great. So, thanks so much for showing <br>your work today and enduring my interminably  <br>long questions sometimes, but I have to say I’ve <br>had a crash course in MacFarlane and Jakob this  <br>last week, and it’s been really a good time, <br>and we now have an insight into your work, and  <br>hopefully we get to hear yourself before too long.<br>That would be really great, because I know when I  <br>got the invitation from Auckland, I was like, <br>‘Wow, that’s fantastic. I can go somewhere.’ <br>Well, no, it’s just a phone call.<br>That’s right. <br>Thanks for agreeing to appear at the event, and <br>for the support your office has given as well,  <br>and I’ll let you get on with your work day. <br>It’s the end of day for us and start for you.  <br>So, thanks and hope we actually do meet one day, <br>that would be a great pleasure, and of course  <br>for our students to hear about more of your work.<br>Thanks very much for making this happen, Michael.  <br>It’s really appreciated. Thanks to the university, <br>and thanks for all the people that attended  <br>today. I’m sorry I couldn’t answer all of <br>the questions, but anyway, maybe next time. <br>Yeah, we’ll do another one someday. Okay, cheers.<br>Thanks very much. <br>See you then Brendan, take care.<br>Okay, bye. <br>Bye-bye. Take care. So, now it’s just <br>for everybody here, a final reminder  <br>that next week there’s a session in the <br>Fast Forward Spring series on the 21st,  <br>that’s Tuesday the 21st, but <br>it’s at lunchtime at one o’clock,  <br>and it’s with Julia Gatley in conversation <br>with Dr Alexandra Jayeun Lee and Rowan Fraser,  <br>architectural graduates making <br>careers outside of architecture.  <br>So, please head to our website fastforward.ac.nz <br>for details to register for that webinar or use  <br>the QR code. So, with that I should say thank <br>you very much for attending, and I’m sorry if it  <br>dragged on a bit for you, if you had plans <br>for this extra 20 or so minutes, but I  <br>think Brendan’s work was well worth delving into <br>a bit longer. Take care, thank you, goodnight.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
