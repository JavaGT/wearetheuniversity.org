today's webinar<br>i'd like to welcome our audience we've<br>got international participants and also<br>new zealand uh based participants and<br>i'd particularly like to acknowledge<br>other my new new zealand colleagues who<br>are currently in lockdown i know for us<br>that's a little bit unusual and<br>internationally and people have been in<br>different spaces but when both ourselves<br>and i particularly like to acknowledge<br>our auckland and northland um uh<br>attendees and who are facing a longer<br>lockdown<br>and also before we get going like to<br>acknowledge and thank our behind the<br>scenes team so we have associate<br>professor ian yeoman who is our series<br>seminar series organizer and also louise<br>grimside from the school of management<br>who's providing organizational and tech<br>support<br>so today's seminar um<br>is around creative places it was the<br>american urban studies professor richard<br>florida who popularized the term<br>creative classes and considered what<br>this means for urban regeneration and in<br>including that what destinations need to<br>do to attract the creative tourists some<br>of the concepts we hear are authenticity<br>new experiences festivals and events<br>looking at collaboration and cultural<br>identity<br>on the slide there you should be able to<br>see a quote from one of our speakers<br>today professor kathleen schiff his<br>recent book created tourism and small<br>communities where she talks about<br>smaller communities have a unique<br>opportunity to develop creative and<br>culturally sustainable tourism<br>industries that provide unparalleled<br>experiences for visitors<br>today we've asked us three speakers to<br>consider this and to think about a post<br>covert 19 world local smaller into small<br>sustainable communities and think about<br>what is the role of creativity in these<br>places<br>so today we have three thought-provoking<br>speakers ahead kathleen chef john allen<br>and leon gorovich they're going to<br>explore different aspects of small<br>communities technologies and destination<br>management<br>now each speaker has about 10 minutes to<br>speak and we also have the question and<br>answer function open on the webinar so<br>this means you can ask questions at any<br>time and our speakers will be able to<br>see them you'll also be able to upvote<br>the questions that come through so when<br>we get to the end and i'll pose all of<br>the questions at the end of the webinar<br>and i'll be able to select some of those<br>that a number of people would like to be<br>um asked<br>i'll just remind uh my fellow speakers<br>that to put themselves on meet when<br>they're not<br>speaking and also remind everybody we<br>are recording this webinar and that will<br>be shared with all of our participants<br>and attendees and including those who<br>are registered and aren't joining us<br>live in probably the next sort of seven<br>so without further ado i'd like to<br>introduce our first speaker kathleen<br>chef she's professor of communications<br>at thompson rivers university in british<br>columbia and joins us today from canada<br>her topic is small is the new big and it<br>particularly draws on the latest edited<br>book creative tourism in smaller<br>communities place culture and local<br>representation<br>published earlier this year by the<br>university of calgary press now i'll<br>just remind our speakers that i'm in<br>control of the slide so you'll hear them<br>say next slide when they'd like us to<br>move on so first of all welcome kathleen<br>thank you very much uh karen and thank<br>you so much to everyone at victoria<br>university of wellington for<br>asking me to participate and<br>um<br>heart goes out to everyone in new<br>zealand uh in lockdown and um<br>welcome to our international audience<br>um i think my first slide is slide five<br>um so we can go to that<br>now when we um started this book uh<br>which was as karen said published in uh<br>april 2021<br>it was before we'd ever heard of covid<br>um so this idea of um focusing on<br>creative tourism in smaller places<br>happened before covet but the pandemic<br>definitely um<br>sharpened the focus on<br>uh small tourism in small places and i<br>kind of think of creative tourism as the<br>marriage of um cultural and experiential<br>tourism<br>so um the kind of<br>the cultural assets<br>of a particular destination<br>are refined and then through<br>experiential opportunity<br>shared in a participatory manner<br>with visitors<br>so<br>um<br>we know from the work of<br>of greg richards um<br>that creative tourism talks about the<br>transfer of culture-based and endogenous<br>knowledge to the visitor and the<br>experiential participation<br>richards talked a lot about<br>collaborative paradigm<br>um in terms of establishing a<br>relationship between<br>the visitor and the resident<br>but um i think that our studies uh in<br>the chat in the first book<br>really um<br>focused on collaborative paradigms<br>not just between<br>um the visitor and the resident but<br>amongst residents and uh and bodies<br>within uh the residents<br>and<br>of course we were interested in uh<br>sustainable tourism development but what<br>comes through in creative tourism uh at<br>least in<br>uh the studies<br>in this book that we're talking about<br>was a more conscious view a<br>longer view toward the sustainability<br>not just of that tourism enterprise but<br>a view toward cultural sustainability of<br>the host community and we'll move to<br>slide six now please<br>now<br>this idea of uh creativity and creative<br>communities creative classes as we've<br>already<br>talked about was kind of<br>sparked by richard<br>florida's<br>work uh in the early nights<br>but i think that even florida himself<br>about a decade later and many other<br>comment commenters commentators have<br>talked about um how in smaller<br>communities um florida's ideas about the<br>creative community<br>are less useful because he relies so<br>much<br>on<br>the idea of an infrastructure and urban<br>infrastructure to draw the creative<br>classes and of course<br>um<br>we know that tourism occurs<br>not just in<br>huge cities in in fact<br>in the book<br>we look at<br>small rural uh communities in portugal<br>eu cities that are smaller than 250 000<br>rural<br>festivals and events in south africa we<br>particularly look at and this is<br>um this is i guess part of being<br>canadian<br>uh is peripheral communities<br>in the yukon in the canadian arctic in<br>iceland and in scandinavia and there are<br>particular issues around<br>remote peripheral<br>communities<br>we look at small communities and how<br>they can benefit from say<br>food tourism<br>or film and television tourism<br>and uh we look<br>and this will interest leon i think in<br>particular<br>we look at wales which is a smaller<br>community than its neighbor great<br>britain but we look at small communities<br>there that are um that have been opened<br>up to tourists<br>via uh um a web platform called the<br>literary uh heritage of wales and um<br>one thing i'd like to bring up is the<br>idea of neighborhoods and i think<br>probably john allen will will talk about<br>this<br>more uh he's the next speaker<br>people it's hard to have that real<br>connection between the everyday life of<br>a community that uh greg richards talks<br>about and the visitor when you're faced<br>with say<br>barcelona<br>how can you really engage in a place uh<br>as huge as barcelona my own work has<br>focused on the el reval<br>neighborhood of barcelona which is a is<br>a highly international one and is kind<br>of on the<br>west side of las vegas with on the east<br>side uh the gottico neighborhood which<br>is now not even a neighborhood it's<br>really a<br>disneyland of<br>barcelona uh but um barcelona realizes<br>that it has a problem with uh its the<br>many tourists that go there on cruise<br>ships for example<br>um being debauched into<br>the two neighborhoods that make up the<br>kind of central area of barcelona<br>there's just not enough infrastructure<br>uh residents in el revell are<br>peeved<br>to say the least um with uh with all the<br>tourists so i think that larger urban<br>communities are getting the idea of<br>neighborhoods copenhagen uh wonderful<br>copenhagen their tourism uh destination<br>organization<br>has<br>declared the end of tourism as we know<br>it and it welcomes the idea of localhood<br>and unlike barcelona it provides<br>technologies<br>to<br>for<br>visitors to visit the smaller<br>neighborhoods<br>within copenhagen um amsterdam is also<br>uh taking part in this as is montreal so<br>i just want to bring up the idea of<br>tourism in smaller places not just being<br>small communities or remote peripheral<br>communities but i'd like to bring up the<br>possibility of neighborhoods within<br>larger urban settings<br>another thing we noted uh that's kind of<br>maybe newish to a discussion of tourism<br>uh in<br>smaller communities is the importance of<br>community-led or culture-led planning<br>to identify cultural assets and<br>bring residents together<br>in making uh tourism<br>experiences and thus being able to have<br>to actually have a relationship uh with<br>visitors we'll move to slide seven now<br>please<br>oh jesus that was me going far too fast<br>and it's left kathleen we'll go to the<br>next one<br>so we will go past slide six and on to<br>slide seven and<br>in the uh book of the all i think there<br>are 14 chapters maybe we we see and i<br>won't read them out loud because<br>everybody who's on this webinar can no<br>doubt read<br>um that we we discovered or pulled out<br>of the chapters five conditions that<br>enable more successful creative<br>place-based tourism in smaller<br>communities these are not necessarily<br>necessary or sufficient conditions but<br>the more of them that are there<br>the more sustainable and successful uh<br>tourism creative tourism will be in<br>smaller communities we can move to slide<br>eight please<br>now of course the main thrust<br>of um of uh creative tourism responds to<br>the trend the want the need for<br>authentically<br>engaged uh everyday life experiences in<br>um in the host destination<br>um and what what we realized is that of<br>course it's much easier<br>to have an everyday life experience if<br>we have a manageable<br>size of place or a manageable home<br>a manageable<br>community a manageable host community<br>and uh<br>corona<br>has of course uh that pandemic has<br>emphasized uh the need for small tourism<br>in small places in canada i live in<br>beautiful british columbia and all<br>summer<br>we were advised to stay local to<br>vacation local we'll go to my final<br>slide please<br>now a new book<br>is coming out in in fact and others on<br>this webinar um have chapters due<br>tomorrow the day after tomorrow here in<br>canada<br>and um<br>so i hope to have the manuscript to ufc<br>press uh by spring 2022 which we will be<br>publication in spring 2023 and that's<br>called that book will be called small<br>tourism in small places<br>and uh there'll be a colon as usual and<br>some sort of<br>really sexy innovative tagline that i<br>have yet to think of<br>um<br>so in the first book we we could see<br>that we we saw a collaborative term<br>uh<br>in creative tourism so ideas of<br>of collaboration not just between res<br>visitors and residents but<br>by networks offering the tourism<br>experience of course there's an artistic<br>trend<br>in many communica in many communities<br>the local arts and crafts are the best<br>way<br>that um that tourists can engage with<br>the cultural assets of<br>of the place<br>um but i think as a result of covid<br>we've seen a third turn<br>and that's really about small tourism<br>experiences and in by small tourism i<br>mean<br>not just urban neighborhoods in slovenia<br>colombia and portugal we'll also be<br>looking at the role of creatives in in<br>semi-wild areas<br>um we're going to look at altruistic<br>providers in your part of the world in<br>southwest australia<br>the regeneration of fit sterling<br>national park<br>we're going to look at um<br>at altruism in an italian small<br>community and in some indigenous<br>communities and then the last section of<br>the book and the last bit of comment i<br>have<br>is that we're going to look at<br>some<br>ideas for developing tourism<br>enterprises we're going to look at<br>in migrants<br>putting on creative tourism experiences<br>in japan<br>we're going to look at the need to<br>address<br>gay tourism visitors in<br>um<br>in<br>british columbia which in many ways is<br>still can still be very conservative<br>um and then ian uh<br>and his partner oona his his his um<br>academic partner una will be looking at<br>ecotourism in small places and that's<br>what we'll be doing<br>in the next book thank you<br>curious thank you kathleen a really nice<br>taster but i also love you've used it to<br>remind yours co-author your um your<br>authors to get their chapters in it's um<br>thank you very much absolutely on this<br>webinar yes really interesting to hear<br>how the new book is going to be building<br>on some of those initial ideas<br>now we have got our first question<br>popped up there and and so if you do<br>have questions for any of our panelists<br>please do popular in the q a and we'll<br>pull together those at the end of the<br>session<br>i'd like to now turn to our second<br>speaker uh john allen he's the chief<br>executive of wellington nz our regional<br>economic development agency uh john's<br>been in the role since i think mid last<br>year and but as an experienced chief<br>executive including new zealand's<br>ministry of foreign affairs and trade<br>he's also served on the board of a<br>number of cultural organizations<br>including te papa and the new zealand<br>festival and he's currently on the um<br>council of victoria university of<br>wellington as well so john with your<br>many many different hats it's really<br>good to have you here and john doesn't<br>have slides so i'm just going to leave<br>this um first one up and um i'll let you<br>know when we've had 10 minutes john cure<br>uh<br>can i first say to kathleen thank you<br>for that presentation uh and by the book<br>uh the book's available at unity i've<br>bought a copy uh and it's good reading<br>and the examples in it are fantastic so<br>get out there and buy the book and it<br>sounds as though it's on a series<br>there's going to be a whole lot of other<br>books uh coming after it so we'll be uh<br>we'll be buying up for a while uh which<br>is great uh i thought the way in which<br>i'd approach this because i'm not an<br>academic i'm more of a practitioner in<br>the tourism space and even then only<br>just a learner<br>against all the experience on this<br>webinar<br>is to approach it through three dates<br>and about three or four examples i might<br>get to five examples if i get really<br>fired up<br>but the uh<br>the context i think<br>is first to think about this place this<br>country of new zealand uh which in my<br>view is or has always positioned itself<br>as small and remote i know that<br>irritates some people<br>but david longing one of our prime<br>ministers once described us as uh shaped<br>like a dagger strategically positioned<br>thrusting at the heart of antarctica<br>uh by which i think he meant we were<br>largely irrelevant uh on the world stage<br>uh the three dates that i want to use is<br>uh first 1870 and i want to use 1870<br>because it was in 1870 that prince<br>alfred uh the then duke of edinburgh<br>arrived to visit new zealand<br>as an early tourist in fact<br>characteristic of the early tourists he<br>was wealthy uh he was you know he had<br>all of the all of the affluence that's<br>now regarded as being a high value<br>tourist<br>and he visited the pink and white<br>terraces<br>with the ottawa people of rotorua<br>and was blown away not only by the place<br>and the geographical magnificence of<br>those particular features now sadly um<br>destroyed<br>but also<br>by the uh enterprise of te arawa people<br>the way in which they were promoting<br>this particular uh feature the way in<br>which they hosted the way in which they<br>guided uh him through his visit<br>and<br>it's interesting that what he was<br>looking for was to understand this place<br>to understand its history and<br>particularly to understand maoridom<br>and<br>you know to get as far away as he<br>possibly could from england in that<br>context<br>in fact another um<br>visitor about that time anthony trollope<br>the famous uh english writer uh having<br>come across the oceans and landed at<br>bluff uh made the observation that it<br>was very disappointing to him this was<br>his initial observation that having come<br>this far he didn't seem to have got away<br>at all from england uh so even then<br>people were wanting different experience<br>uh they were wanting authentic<br>experience to use kathleen's language<br>and they were wanting to be able to<br>engage uh in a real way<br>with the people of our place<br>the second date that i'd use then is to<br>move forward to<br>19<br>1965 and i'm only using that as a sort<br>of way place holder<br>at the time that uh prince um<br>uh alfred arrived we were having about 5<br>000 tourists a year and the first and<br>first um recorded dates we were doing<br>about<br>5233 i think was in 1903.<br>by about 1965 that number had gone up to<br>about 70 000. obviously ships and<br>transport and all kinds of reasons for<br>that by 19 by 2019 my third date by 2019<br>tourism as most of this call probably<br>know i was at 3.9 million uh visitors<br>and as kathleen has said<br>uh it was putting enormous pressure on<br>uh infrastructure on community<br>uh on uh environment uh and was simply<br>not sustainable uh the um the<br>opportunity the license to operate uh<br>for tourism businesses was under real<br>threat in this country and in other<br>places around the world and so the small<br>tourism message<br>that kathleen's just uh represented<br>is a necessary repost and a necessary<br>repositioning obviously booked into even<br>sharper relief<br>by covert so now my examples<br>i thought i'd start actually in a very<br>small town i thought i'd start in<br>featherston<br>uh that might be in the next book i'm<br>not sure but the new zealand uh<br>contributors might be uh looking at<br>fitness a featherston's a tiny wee town<br>about an hour's drive out of uh<br>out of wellington<br>it was largely bypassed by effectively<br>anything uh until about the 19<br>the early 2000s<br>and there was very little in the way of<br>development it's now a hotbed of<br>artistic endeavour<br>it's now a book town<br>and it's positioned itself through that<br>mechanism as being a place to live a<br>place to work a place to play<br>and it's been a remarkable<br>transformation it's attracted all kinds<br>of artists uh people like joy cowley<br>live there sam duck jones one of our<br>young poets<br>who described it in fact as now he<br>described the contemporary featherston<br>experience experience as being a<br>frontier town with a fromarjary which i<br>thought was a terrific explanation of um<br>uh of featherston but what happened in<br>featherston was really interesting<br>because what happened was a group of<br>residents got together<br>with a clear long-term vision for the<br>city<br>for the community<br>uh and they and their passion drove this<br>establishment of book town<br>they engaged the community around it<br>they created a festival out of that<br>engagement which now attracts hundreds<br>of people uh to featherston has spawned<br>a whole accommodation industry in<br>featherston uh has made featherston a<br>center of debate and discussion and<br>artistic endeavor that it would never<br>have thought were possible<br>uh and uh unfortunately as a consequence<br>has driven up the prices of featherston<br>property uh which i suspect is driving<br>out the very artists that are necessary<br>to wellington city<br>for a second example and of course those<br>of you on the call from new zealand will<br>remember that there were times when<br>wellington wasn't a creative heartbeat<br>of the nation when it wasn't seen as the<br>most dynamic diverse tolerant engaged<br>and exciting place<br>in our country i know many of you won't<br>be able to remember those times but they<br>do exist and they were in about the 70s<br>and 80s we were thought to be grey<br>bureaucratic unbelievably boring and<br>basically a place that you would avoid<br>at all costs<br>so what changed well i want to talk<br>about just two things that happened at<br>that time two examples<br>one is the establishment of zealandia<br>so as many of you will know<br>zealandia was the first ecosanctuary<br>created in an urban center<br>uh it's surrounded by about 8.3<br>kilometers of predator proof<br>um fencing<br>and that has enabled a 500 year vision<br>to re-establish the biodiversity<br>of our community<br>right in the heart of the capital city<br>of our country it's a startling and<br>dynamic vision it's extraordinary<br>technology that's enabled the<br>predator-proofing but what they've then<br>been able to do is bring bird life 18<br>species that weren't seen<br>in the capital back into the capital and<br>then they have bred in this enclosed<br>environment and and out they go so we've<br>got masses of birds we've got birds on<br>we've got birds we've never seen before<br>uh because of this engagement and what's<br>exciting about that the reason that i<br>think it fits neatly into kathleen's<br>um uh<br>description<br>is because that vision was brought to<br>life by volunteers so they use volunteer<br>labor hundreds of volunteers they have<br>thousands of members from our community<br>who were engaged actively in the work of<br>that and the delivery of the vision of<br>that particular opportu that particular<br>uh experience they attracted 143 000<br>visitors in the 2020 year and that was<br>disrupted by govind so that's a pretty<br>remarkable thing<br>uh and they are<br>linked to a series of universities and<br>academic studies so there's real<br>knowledge sharing uh going on both with<br>the visitor through um through uh<br>curated visits and you know<br>people guiding them through the<br>experience but also in their own<br>understanding and research so it's a<br>great example i think of an opportunity<br>out of the cbd in the suburbs but which<br>is very<br>directly engaging visitors<br>uh inspiring visitors educating visitors<br>in a unique and different way now i'll<br>just use one more because i suspect i'm<br>getting to the end of my um my three<br>minutes or so a minute or so all right<br>very brief on this one<br>um so i thought weta<br>now i i know i've got wellington on<br>plate up there and i could do that if i<br>get time but but but wetter is is a good<br>one so weta i think is a brand most<br>people around the world will know it's a<br>a screen phenomenon<br>uh created by peter jackson uh<br>responsible for lord of the rings which<br>has taken new zealand to the to the<br>international community in the<br>remarkable way i want to talk about weta<br>cave and with a cave is a tiny little<br>shop really um way out in miramar<br>peninsula which is in a suburban part of<br>um<br>of wellington uh established by uh<br>richard taylor and his wife uh in their<br>wet workshop business<br>uh and what that does is predictably<br>sell little bits and pieces of uh<br>iconography from uh from wetter movies<br>but the thing that i think makes it<br>interesting is not that every visitor<br>goes there because of that<br>but because they also offer<br>engaged you know<br>interactive opportunity for tourists and<br>visitors to learn the traditional arts<br>of of uh model making that richard's<br>built his whole career on of costuming<br>including chain mail making which has<br>been a key if you look at the movies<br>they make chain mail's a big part of it<br>so so there's a real interactive<br>opportunity uh in that experience and<br>again it's all driven by a long term<br>vision<br>that the artistry of those basic<br>creative techniques and capabilities<br>needs to be preserved and people need to<br>understand those skills and need to<br>engage with those skills if they're<br>going to be preserved so again it's<br>driven by a long-term vision it's<br>anchored in deep understanding and<br>creativity<br>it's authentic to place<br>and it is creating opportunity for a<br>sustainable tourism operation now<br>there's heaps of other opportunities but<br>what i would say to you is that those<br>are the features that i wanted to draw<br>out from the examples to suggest to you<br>what the elements of a successful<br>small<br>focused authentic tourist experience<br>might be<br>and in my view that is the direction in<br>which tourism in ultira new zealand<br>is going to<br>proceed kia ora<br>curious thank you john really<br>fascinating examples and and one of our<br>first questions was actually about is<br>small tourism um only about rural<br>communities and i think you've<br>illustrated very well it's it's not um<br>there is question answers open we've got<br>some questions lined up for um later but<br>first let's go to our third and final<br>speaker associate professor leon<br>garovich<br>leon is based in the wellington school<br>of architecture here at victoria<br>university of wellington and is also the<br>associate dean research and innovation<br>for that faculty he's going to be<br>talking to us today about creative<br>cities and creative technologies cura<br>welcome liam<br>kiana thanks for having me and uh i just<br>want to say what a fantastic both of the<br>previous talks of i've had multiple<br>points in both of them that i've thought<br>oh there's connections here so um<br>hopefully we'll be able to start to see<br>the connections across all of them so<br>can we just jump to the next slide in<br>the spirit of kind of classic i've only<br>got 10 minutes to talk i'm going to talk<br>far faster than i probably rightly<br>should and i'm probably not going to get<br>through anything everything in any way<br>um<br>and and also in the spirit of that kind<br>of thing i have more questions on this<br>slide than i could possibly hope to<br>answer usually in you know answers on<br>the postcard the length of a phd please<br>um<br>the the<br>the images here of these of these<br>utopian cities i put them in not because<br>i'm<br>keen on this kind of thing but more<br>because actually they generally tend to<br>make me laugh because these utopian<br>cities that we imagine as being uh<br>fantastic new places for communities to<br>to to live and be and and thrive<br>um<br>i often find there<br>you know<br>the reality of cities and the reality of<br>lived experience and the everyday is<br>always for me both more mundane when it<br>really comes down to it and more<br>exciting because of the mundaneness and<br>i kind of want to talk about the<br>relationship between um<br>the mundane and creativity or the<br>mundane and innovation because i<br>actually think the processes of<br>creativity and processes of innovation<br>weirdly are more mundane than we usually<br>give ourselves that we we we give credit<br>for basically um<br>because i'm talking about creative<br>cities and creative technologies the<br>first thing i wanted to say is our<br>city's creative and our technology is<br>creative and um as you'll see on the<br>next slide in a minute i i really you<br>know what i want to say is no i want to<br>avoid technological determinism i hate<br>the technological determinism that<br>somehow wants to personify cities or<br>technologies and say it's people that<br>are creative and it's how are those<br>people organized and in what what<br>relationship to each other are those<br>people organized and how does that spark<br>creativity so the first thing i would<br>say is can ca you know are they creative<br>no<br>can cities and technologies help to<br>accelerate creativity though can they<br>help to foster it and i would say<br>absolutely yes and what we need to do is<br>understand something about what<br>creativity is and what is the process of<br>creativity and innovation in order to<br>understand how<br>communities um<br>and technologies can<br>either accelerate it or as everybody's i<br>think people are starting to work out<br>pretty quickly about airbnb uh they can<br>hinder it as well that that certain<br>seemingly disruptive innovations can end<br>up being very harmful for community and<br>creativity in the long term<br>and we'll jump to the next slide<br>so the first thing i want to say about<br>creativity and innovation i i'm going to<br>look in the most unusual of places i'm<br>going to go for the uh quarterly journal<br>of economics this was a fantastic<br>article from 1998 i i i come back to<br>this over and over again in which martin<br>wiseman he said what is innovation he<br>basically tries to quantify in a<br>mathematical way he says what is<br>innovation and um the fascinating thing<br>argument he comes up with is<br>innovation is not a<br>and by extension creativity a lot of the<br>time is not a eureka moment it's not and<br>i've got it it's not uh i you know<br>thomas edison did not invent the light<br>bulb he he had uh<br>groups of<br>20 or 30 people working in manila park<br>testing thousands of different possible<br>combinations to come up with a light<br>bulb and he was one of 28 other people<br>who invented the light bulb at the same<br>time<br>so<br>innovation is not a eureka moment it's<br>it's according to wiseman it's what's<br>called uh recombinant he talks about<br>recombinant growth and that is old ideas<br>being put together in new ways he says<br>almost all innovation his old ideas<br>being put together in new ways and there<br>are other um theorists who write about<br>this as well uh<br>um<br>uh matt ridley i'm not a big fan of matt<br>ridley but matt ridley does talk about<br>um<br>he says you know innovation is is<br>basically slow and iterative it's it's a<br>continual it's a trial and error process<br>basically<br>um one thing ridley does say that i<br>think is interesting is he says cities<br>can tend to be creative innovation<br>engines that cities are often the the<br>the origin and the location of a lot of<br>creativity and if we look at why that is<br>it's really because cities are and have<br>been for a very long time especially<br>pre-internet a place where dense<br>networks could grow dense networks of<br>people dense networks of ideas uh dense<br>networks of skills and sharing of skills<br>and so what we know is is to to to to<br>hit you with a really uh broad kind of<br>um<br>a broad claim which is that networks can<br>improve opportunities for recombinants<br>and therefore networks can often improve<br>opportunities for<br>creative innovation<br>and of course um uh<br>the men the the the case of featherston<br>was just an example of that when feather<br>when john allen brought up featherston i<br>also actually thought about uh<br>berlin berlin's a classic example in<br>which<br>uh artists were shipped to berlin and<br>berlin became a powerfully creative uh<br>hub basically and this was because the<br>more networks of artists sharing ideas<br>the more chances for those artists to<br>then start recombining each other's<br>ideas and start to come up with more<br>ideas so what i would say is cities are<br>or can be nodal points for creative<br>tourism whether or not they are a small<br>a small community or not but the next<br>question i'd like to all the next point<br>i'd like to make is the question of of<br>small communities i think and and both<br>uh kathleen and john touched on this um<br>i think you can have small communities<br>in large cities as well right you can<br>have big dense networks but small<br>communities within them<br>and if we can jump to our next slide<br>and where i really got this sense was a<br>a<br>research project i have had for quite a<br>number of years now called the digital<br>workshops of the world in which i was<br>interviewing and studying and modeling<br>the migration pathways of tech industry<br>workers around the world i fed in about<br>30 000 and later 80 000 visual effects<br>industry workers and modeled this<br>modeled them moving around the world to<br>see who was coming in and out of new<br>zealand and what kind of skills were<br>coming in and now and whether the kind<br>of skills that you have the kind of<br>capacity you have in the tech industry<br>changes how mobile you are because<br>another thing about mobility and<br>migration and tourism is an important<br>aspect of this is that mobility and<br>migration often help to foster creative<br>innovation because again they help<br>recombinance they help bring in new<br>ideas<br>and what i just what i noticed though<br>was that even though this was 30 to 80<br>000 people i was looking at<br>the networks were actually almost small<br>communities the people knew each other<br>in london in in vancouver in<br>sydney in new zealand and they were<br>getting each other jobs and when i was<br>interviewing them one of the things i<br>this again was wetter digital i started<br>to interview people<br>i was interested in how many people had<br>come to new zealand uh from america and<br>britain and canada and australia<br>how many had come to new zealand and why<br>and many of them talked about<br>um<br>there it was not just a labor decision<br>it was actually a holiday decision that<br>many of them saw<br>six-month contracts or one-year<br>contracts and then ended up staying in<br>new zealand quite often but they built<br>global networks but they saw coming to<br>new zealand for a six month or a<br>year-long period as an opportunity for<br>an extended vacation at the same time as<br>they worked<br>so i think it's important to think in<br>terms of<br>i think because because i think there's<br>a potential post pandemic for and and of<br>course with<br>climate change issues rising up the<br>agenda very rapidly for extended<br>workations to be the the opposite or the<br>alternative tourism model in which you<br>are trying to consume as little carbon<br>as possible<br>and two weeks on a plane to get to new<br>zealand is not one of those ways of<br>consuming as little carbon as possible<br>you want to be there for a year or<br>longer potentially<br>oh no not the final site well this was<br>just a thing about i i just wanted to<br>and i mentioned it earlier i just wanted<br>to get away from the idea that the<br>disruptive innovation and create the<br>there's a lot of discussion about you<br>know creative innovation and the tech<br>industry as if as if all creative<br>innovation and is a as if all<br>quote-unquote disruptive innovation is<br>good and uh<br>this open letter to airbnb was written<br>very recently in which it's very very<br>quickly um there is an understanding of<br>the way in which certain forms of<br>networks forms of global networking and<br>global tourist consumption can destroy<br>small communities uh and and are<br>starting to have a hollowing out effect<br>although i'm sure kathleen's actually<br>talked about this in many places and i'm<br>sure it's something john um is grappling<br>with at times and then to the final<br>slide then and i just wanted to to put<br>one one eye final idea out there i<br>published an article at the beginning of<br>the year called the spectacle of<br>competence which was about the adern<br>government and its response to um<br>the global pandemic um<br>what i wanted to say is<br>we are<br>obviously we are in a a a radically kind<br>of accelerated moment in our history in<br>which all sorts of questions are being<br>thrown up about how we do things and how<br>we operate um and one of the things that<br>that strikes me every time i think about<br>networks is that we are in this moment<br>where we can physically see<br>the pandemic has accelerated the growth<br>of both biogeographies and also kind of<br>bio networks in which in which we are<br>trying to use technologies to try to<br>understand networks of people i mean<br>there's nothing better i think than<br>than a deadly virus for making us aware<br>of all of the network interconnections<br>that we didn't even realize we had until<br>we walk into a cafe and someone else in<br>there has has got a transmissible<br>disease um and so i think<br>creative tourism is being altered by<br>changing biogeographies and i think it<br>will continue even if the virus went<br>away tomorrow i still believe that it<br>would be continue to be changed and<br>continue to change partly because it has<br>accelerated our attitudes to the<br>capacity for change i think and i'm i'm<br>going to stop there and i hope that made<br>yours thank you very much leon and i'd<br>like to thank all three of our speakers<br>for really thought provoking and really<br>well connected um presentations<br>i'm just going to stop um the share of<br>the slides and we're going to now turn<br>two questions we've got three questions<br>lined up at the moment so if you do want<br>to get in with a question pop it up on<br>the q a m now and the first question<br>will go to professor jane bryce who's<br>dean of our and wellington school of<br>business and government and her<br>questions been nicely upvoted and links<br>really well into something you touched<br>on right at the end leon but in fact<br>actually jane asked this whilst kathleen<br>was presenting right at the beginning<br>and this is how does small tourism<br>particularly living like a local avoid<br>becoming another over explo exposed<br>corporate venture with unintended<br>consequences and airbnb been an example<br>of that so<br>kathleen did you want to to start us<br>there<br>i can start us um<br>yes i mean<br>it's an excellent question and um in al<br>raval for example<br>um airbnb<br>is a scourge<br>uh<br>on the neighborhood um<br>it's<br>terrible<br>they are absentee landlords<br>um<br>rents are driven up so high that um out<br>that<br>that the residents can't stay there<br>anymore um and al raval has typically<br>been a working class neighborhood um<br>throughout<br>throughout history uh it's been on the<br>edge uh it used to be called you know<br>chinatown there's<br>there was that's where um the<br>prostitution business was the drug<br>business it's still not a great<br>infrastructure in el revell and um of<br>course these absentee landlords uh buy<br>up places<br>and the residents hate it<br>they hate that people are bringing their<br>skateboards and if you've been in el<br>revell or anywhere downtown barcelona<br>you know the streets are like this wide<br>and then the buildings go up and i don't<br>know if you have a skateboarding son but<br>i sure do<br>so i know how loud skateboards are<br>there's all kinds of posters up saying<br>uh dear airbnb people we hope you're<br>enjoying your vacation but realize that<br>we live here too please pick up your<br>skateboards and there are noise<br>detectors i mean<br>it's really hard to defend absentee<br>airbnb owners<br>in my view however it's not hard to<br>defend the kind of original idea of<br>airbnb of<br>staying with a local and living like a<br>local<br>um<br>i'm not sure how to address that<br>uh but i think that<br>um if residents are and and we've heard<br>it from both of my colleagues the other<br>speakers the necessity for um buy-in<br>from local residents in order for<br>uh<br>live like a local like airbnb<br>to work well<br>thank you<br>leona allen do you want to jump into<br>the one thing i would just say is um<br>that article and it is a it's a popular<br>press article but the article um<br>that was on the slide about the open<br>letter to airbnb the really interesting<br>thing about that is it does actually<br>suggest a whole load of uh solutions it<br>does actually say here's how you could<br>have a business model that's not<br>destroying communities that does allow<br>investment that does allow people to but<br>also um if you want to bring back the<br>original idea that that you can do that<br>by limiting how many days limiting to 14<br>days in america a year that you could do<br>that and because that's the average<br>length of a vacation for someone and<br>make sure that they're coming into your<br>house but if you're wanting to do the<br>investment model you know there's<br>clearly a demand for airbnb style things<br>that that that replace the the hotel<br>industry um and and their suggestion is<br>build them and build them with investors<br>with with actual airbnb the absentee<br>landlords who want to put the money in<br>there<br>um i won't go over the whole detail of<br>it but it was what was interesting about<br>that article for me was it was both<br>saying<br>you know this is going to become a very<br>profoundly acute social problem very<br>quickly but also put some suggestions<br>thank you leon<br>so let's jump now to a question from<br>eliza raymond eliza is one of our phd<br>students but also the founder of good<br>travel um company and um she's asking uh<br>does or could creative tourism have a<br>role to play in developing new types of<br>domestic tourism experiences and use the<br>example of could migrant communities<br>offer creative tourism experience to<br>help us travel without leaving home and<br>engaging diversity within our own places<br>and and john maybe you want to start<br>uh i think the short answer to that is<br>yes<br>i think there's a huge wealth of um of<br>experience and knowledge<br>that can be shared from the diverse<br>migrant communities that we have within<br>altera new zealand<br>and from my point of view<br>the the opportunity to harness that with<br>technology such as virtual reality type<br>technology that can bring to life in a<br>visual way some of the experiences that<br>might be being narrated the stories that<br>might be being told uh by the people who<br>are within our community uh to to us as<br>uh tourists if you like uh would make<br>that a very powerful proposition<br>um i i suppose that does raise a point<br>that i would see us<br>the locals<br>being the tourists in that context<br>and that's an idea<br>that i haven't developed or thought<br>about previously uh but i'm sure both of<br>my other speakers have<br>uh but uh that's interest an interesting<br>idea in terms of what the future of<br>tourism might look like in a<br>there's another question popped up that<br>actually speaks to that as well john and<br>from christie grant around thoughts<br>around virtual tourism and digital<br>engagement in the absence or with<br>limitations around international travel<br>and i i think you started answering that<br>as well in terms of how that can work as<br>a local as a tourist<br>leon or kathleen do you want to pick up<br>kathleen<br>thank you i i think that's an excellent<br>question and an excellent idea<br>uh migrant uh<br>communities within a place that's a<br>small community um certainly<br>there's there's a possibility there um<br>and uh<br>i think just to go back to something<br>john said i think when when we think<br>about uh greg richard's idea of<br>co-creation of tourism experiences that<br>the difference the difference between a<br>tourist and a resident can get smaller<br>let me share it so i talk and thank you<br>john for pitching my book but i would<br>also say that like the university of<br>calgary press i believe in open access i<br>really think that<br>refereed<br>publications<br>shouldn't have to hide behind a paywall<br>whether it's virtual or cash that ideas<br>should be shared so it's an open access<br>book<br>so free i used it to teach my creative<br>tourism class<br>uh last semester whatever semesters are<br>now in covet it's all mixed up<br>um and<br>here are two ideas that go along with<br>that question<br>one is a student had come up<br>that<br>came up through<br>the kamloops local beekeeping<br>community<br>and how that<br>could be a creative tourism experience<br>he had all kinds of stats about how how<br>long hives should be open when in the<br>year they should be open the cost of<br>protective equipment just everything<br>like that and another idea we have this<br>killer<br>high-end vintage used clothing store<br>consignment store here<br>and um i thought what a great idea it<br>would be if the woman who owns that like<br>what if she did<br>once a week for tourists<br>two hours a two hour visit into her back<br>room like how does consignment<br>uh<br>clothing uh work how does that work as a<br>sustainable<br>cultural industry in a community<br>what are the sustainability benefits and<br>then everyone could get a five dollar<br>gift certificate or something and have<br>shopping time so i think yeah your idea<br>of migrants is one good example that<br>there are many examples of how<br>small interest communities or ethnic<br>communities or religious communities or<br>food communities<br>could have sustainable small tourism in<br>thank you kathleen<br>i'm going to move on to another question<br>now which is from professor chris rank<br>euro chris from the university of<br>waikato and he's talk referring back to<br>i think kathleen you talked about<br>copenhagen at one point but thinking<br>about directing to us into neighborhoods<br>and the use of smart tourism<br>technologies but i think he poses an<br>interesting question here you know can<br>small rural communities effectively<br>engage in such smart tourism techniques<br>like has been done in copenhagen and<br>what support do communities require in<br>the forthcoming world of 5g<br>and other technologies<br>leon did you want to start us on that<br>one<br>classic it had to be at some point right<br>you said you were gonna do it<br>yeah um i<br>i think<br>for me<br>the<br>again when we're talking about<br>technologies it's really um<br>i think<br>i think what we need to remember is that<br>the technology facilitates what's<br>already there i think i think where<br>technology gets used effectively um so<br>we're talking about you know uh chris is<br>talking about um smart tourism<br>techniques um<br>the the<br>the technology has to facilitate<br>something that already exists and<br>therefore then wants to be rolled out<br>further or we then have a requirement<br>for i mean one of the things i'm<br>constantly say to my students is because<br>i think there's a danger whenever we<br>talk about technology and the use of<br>technology is that we imagine that what<br>happens is<br>that technology miraculously comes from<br>on high<br>and changes everything<br>um and nobody expected it to be that way<br>now sometimes technologies get<br>implemented and we we<br>that we<br>humans creatively find new ways of<br>deploying that technology that weren't<br>originally intended but most of the time<br>technologies are thought of first they<br>are<br>they are imagined as something we want<br>and then we we implement them and of<br>course you you see that all the time in<br>in<br>uh<br>kind of french postcards from 150 years<br>ago of people talking over zoom<br>basically using a cinema and a phone um<br>so<br>in terms of<br>how how communities can<br>you know when you're talking about<br>community uh<br>you know how do we support communities<br>in the in the world of 5g<br>well<br>the the question for me is<br>firstly<br>not just 5g but the speed of<br>of of increase of technological<br>implementation<br>um<br>it's so significant that often we're<br>grappling with today's problems and<br>tomorrow's technology kind of<br>accelerates past that problem so i'm<br>thinking about i grew up in a village of<br>300 people on the west coast of scotland<br>and<br>it was<br>pretty cut off it was radically cut off<br>um<br>and for years and years and years<br>everyone talked about even having access<br>to television signals<br>and and before you know it the last time<br>i went there it was like a different<br>world completely because of the internet<br>now<br>in terms of of supporting communities i<br>think the the question quite often is uh<br>where is the community and what's the<br>what's the quality of the of the<br>capacity for infrastructure uh<br>implementation and then what do we do<br>about what happens when we do implement<br>that so<br>for example<br>uh<br>new zealand rural communities have will<br>have come online with internet pretty<br>quickly<br>because new zealand has the capacity to<br>implement um widespread the question is<br>do you want it actually the question<br>also is how much do you want 5g how much<br>do you want internet connectivity how<br>much do we want<br>uh elon musk giving us<br>internet access while we're hiking on a<br>great walk in new zealand because i know<br>i don't i mean i know that one of the<br>selling points in new zealand again<br>is if it has been that it is<br>disconnected um we have to think about<br>the the question of uh<br>you know for a very very long time it<br>was all a question of um<br>uh people having access to the internet<br>and the digital divide and increasingly<br>seeing people in silicon valley the<br>digital dividers those that can afford<br>to teach their kids in a way that they<br>are explicitly not allowed access to<br>ipads and to networks<br>um<br>for all sorts of reasons so the question<br>i think the question is more than just<br>how do we support communities with<br>incoming technologies it's it's how do<br>we choose which kind of technologies we<br>want to have and and and john's got a<br>question now i think i'm going to give<br>john the last minute and then we will<br>need to wrap up so john over to you<br>two thoughts on on that issue the first<br>is if we want people to come on<br>workstations as has just been uh<br>described which i think is a very<br>exciting and interesting idea in a post<br>covered world then the availability of<br>technology that will enable them to link<br>and work back into their<br>their wider networks and communities is<br>going to be important and 5gs probably<br>whether it actually adds any value or<br>not i don't really know but it's<br>probably going to be a<br>become a sort of ubiquitous requirement<br>i would think in that way i'm interested<br>in chris's ideas about<br>you know what's described as smart<br>tourism techniques i'm not entirely sure<br>what smart tourism techniques are but if<br>what you mean by that chris is<br>opportunities to tell stories and<br>provide information and insight and that<br>sort of thing in new and different ways<br>uh whether you're on one of the tracks<br>or wherever you might be uh then i think<br>that is interesting and i think that<br>could add value because<br>uh we know that uh engaging audience and<br>helping them understand the stories of a<br>place as part of how they feel part of<br>the community<br>and perhaps technology can play a part<br>thank you john and i'm gonna need to<br>wrap it up now so apologies if we didn't<br>get to the last a couple of questions we<br>will share those with the and their<br>speakers but i'd like to uh thank uh<br>kathleen chef leongorovich and john<br>allen for really stimulating uh with<br>discussion reflective on creative places<br>and creative tourism in small<br>communities and on behalf of the<br>university thank you and thank you to<br>everyone for joining us and next webinar<br>is not until november it's going to be<br>about extended reality and we'll use our<br>usual mailing lists to get that<br>information out but in the meantime<br>thank you again to our speakers um have<br>a look at kathleen's book let's look<br>forward to the next uh the next book um<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
