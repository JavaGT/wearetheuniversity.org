What if we rethought our governance models? What does a female perspective bring to views on governance? What does good governance look like? How shall we assess our successes and failures? Do we only value what we can measure? <br><br>Listen to the views of the highly experienced panel: Suzanne Snively, Melissa Clark-Reynolds, Rachel Taulelei and Professor Sally Davenport. Moderator - Kirsten Patterson. Welcome and closing remarks - Professor Jane Bryson, Acting Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Wellington School of Business and Government.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

event uh taking a seat at<br>the board table<br>um perspectives on governance in rtro<br>and new zealand and so welcome i'm the<br>acting pro vice chancellor and dean of<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government jane bryson<br>and it's my real pleasure to have this<br>absolutely fabulous panel of speakers<br>here today and<br>to have<br>kirsten patterson kp the chief executive<br>of the institute of directors as the<br>facilitator of today's conversation<br>um we're not going to read through<br>everyone's bios those are available to<br>you<br>online<br>because we know that you're keen to<br>hear what our panelists have to say<br>but i would want to reiterate the<br>welcome to the wellington school of<br>business and government to teharangawaka<br>victoria university of wellington<br>we're<br>based here in the business school right<br>in the heart of the city<br>right between business and government<br>and the panelists that we have here<br>today<br>have experience in governance right<br>across business public sector private<br>sector<br>not-for-profit<br>and that's really at the heart of what<br>we're doing here<br>in the business school bringing together<br>those different perspectives so i'm<br>really looking forward to hearing<br>what people have to say and so um with<br>no more ado i'll pass over to kp to<br>referee this session<br>i'll just mention that<br>you are able to post questions<br>throughout the session and there is a<br>voting function so you can vote up the<br>questions that you most want to see<br>answered by the panel and i'm sure kp<br>will remind you of that as we go through<br>thank you very much jane<br>jane may not know this but actually<br>she's responsible for me getting into my<br>first ever governance role<br>and it was an advisory board here at the<br>university many many years ago<br>and that was my very first exposure into<br>governance and uh here we are today<br>having a conversation about perspectives<br>on governance uh so as jane said kiana<br>my name is kirsten everyone calls me kp<br>it's my great honor to be the ceo for<br>the institute of directors and to be<br>sitting with this amazing panel um the<br>reason we're not reading bios today is<br>because if we were going to read the<br>phenomenal bios of everyone sitting on<br>this panel there would be your entire<br>hour session because they've achieved so<br>much they're doing so many amazing<br>things<br>and we've really got uh some sort of<br>great questions and things to dive into<br>so we're i'm going to um dive straight<br>in we're going to there's opportunity<br>for you to ask questions please do use<br>that q a function vote up those<br>questions and the things that you'd like<br>to sort of pose to the panel now's your<br>opportunity to sort of challenge this<br>group ask them some questions about what<br>they're seeing what they're thinking<br>what does the future hold for governance<br>in aotearoa new zealand so um kind of a<br>couple of opening questions to get us<br>started i'm going to head down the panel<br>we have got a a mic here hopefully the<br>sound's going to be okay for you we're<br>going to get a little bit of feedback on<br>that<br>but hopefully that might the sound will<br>be coming through okay as we sort of<br>adjust into the new world i'm headed<br>this way first you can pass it along if<br>you want to to rachel she's right on the<br>end<br>she was trying not to make eye contact<br>saying don't come to me first<br>but you know gotta swing the ball out to<br>the right first look you've had a real<br>range of different governance<br>perspectives<br>and in terms of some of the leadership<br>roles you've held as well what does good<br>governance look like<br>what's your sort of vision for for good<br>governance for lto in new zealand<br>um<br>thank you for having me if at my own<br>university i just want to put that in<br>there um look good governance to me and<br>a really strong table looks like one<br>that is diverse both in thought and an<br>experience i think it's one that's<br>inclusive i think it's one that is<br>informed where people are<br>equally informed about the task at hand<br>i think it's one where the group has<br>all committed to to a similar outcome<br>for the organization they're all deeply<br>and um similarly committed all but they<br>might have different perspectives on how<br>to get to that endpoint but um i think<br>that the strongest tables i have set it<br>have had a chair that leaves a lot of<br>space for different personalities to<br>show themselves but also calls out all<br>of those different personalities at the<br>right time so all of those sorts of all<br>of those sorts of attributes yeah so you<br>said on a panel i think was earlier in<br>the week<br>and one of the questions you was asked<br>was about board strategy overrated<br>underwriters there was a bit of a split<br>on the panel so i was just interested<br>what's you know how do you tell good<br>governance from the outside<br>can you see it from the outside<br>and sort of boards roll in some of those<br>big strategic pieces can is it visible<br>from the outside i don't think if you<br>mean from the outside of a business<br>probably not if you mean even from the<br>outside of the boardroom probably not<br>it's a hard one to tell unless you have<br>been in there and being part of the<br>conversations and<br>and felt um and influenced the dynamic<br>at the table it's very hard to actually<br>tell what's what's happening there<br>but i think the question was<br>do we over rate or underrate a board's<br>ability to influence strategy and the<br>implementation of that and it was a two<br>to one and i'd said sometimes we<br>we over the board's ability to do that<br>because in my experience<br>and this is obviously always very<br>contentious around boards and management<br>it's management's role to create a<br>strategy but then present to the board<br>and this is why i've liked to do it as a<br>ceo for their input and and for them to<br>show their experience and lean their<br>weight into the parts of the strategy<br>that they're most knowledgeable about or<br>have most um the best skill set for um<br>then their ability to actually implement<br>that<br>uh<br>it becomes harder because really i think<br>their job is to support management's<br>implementation of that strategy so yeah<br>we had a bit of a split a split one<br>there yeah yeah they'll be interesting<br>one to come to melissa or too in terms<br>of you know where where that<br>responsibility sits i wonder um<br>as our time as ceos as we move into<br>boards of our view about where strategy<br>responsibility might change as our role<br>changes um coming to you sally um tell<br>us about your perspectives on governance<br>you know success as failures what are we<br>seeing and what's your view okay all<br>right well so my main experience from<br>governance has been on the productivity<br>commission which is slightly different<br>than that you know we were half-time<br>commissioners so you're you're a<br>commissioner for most the time and then<br>you become a sort of a board when we<br>have the board meetings but you're much<br>more involved with the organization as a<br>commissioner so it's it's it's sort of<br>an unusual blend of that but then on the<br>other hand i've also reported to some<br>some great boards and great chairs and i<br>think um<br>that<br>for me it's about that having that<br>really robust conversations and being<br>feeling that you've got<br>the trust around the table and and the<br>space to really explore things rather<br>than um some of the worst things is when<br>you see people getting into the<br>nitty-gritty of of you know operational<br>things so so for me i think it's that<br>making sure it's um that diverse views<br>certainly is is wonderful and and being<br>open to challenge but without feeling<br>any threat in the room<br>so the um productive commissioner has<br>done some reports on frontier firms and<br>the importance of good governance are<br>boards doing enough to focus on<br>productivity what do we need to be doing<br>since i actually left the commission a<br>couple of years ago so i wasn't involved<br>in that latest one but um i think the<br>productivity issue is<br>not so much that we've got you know<br>obviously really good frontier firms<br>there are some really good frontier<br>firms almost at world frontier but it's<br>the long tail<br>so you've got a huge spread of<br>governance ability and management<br>ability um and we don't have<br>the robust sort of market forces that<br>might actually weed out some of the<br>lower productivity firms in a normal<br>market because there isn't that pressure<br>there but certainly i think you know<br>there's a lot of things about skill<br>level and board and management that i<br>think it still says us sitting in a<br>business school um that that are still<br>um you know could be greatly improved<br>and i think some of that is about you<br>know sharing being more sharing around<br>um<br>with experience and that's where i think<br>the iod plays an important role of me of<br>upskilling people<br>great thank you suzanne i'm going to<br>come across to you um so passing the bet<br>in literally<br>um across to you<br>what is what does good governance look<br>like<br>well i i came up with a little acromen<br>which is um arowanui lots of love<br>where<br>l stands for love<br>i think there needs to be a lot more<br>love<br>and that<br>is reflected in diversity<br>but it also needs to be reflected a lot<br>more than i've seen<br>in terms of understanding your customer<br>understanding your stakeholders and your<br>shareholders<br>understanding your staff and actually<br>recognizing that they've all got a role<br>to play<br>and with that you also then can<br>recognize<br>opportunity<br>i feel that we put so much time into<br>compliance<br>that a lot of low-hanging fruit is<br>missed in new zealand where we could<br>actually be stretching a lot more than<br>we do<br>and<br>risk management strategies which focus<br>only on risk and not on the mitigations<br>which can lead to opportunities really<br>have undermined i think the the<br>effectiveness of what boards could be<br>and then with teamwork<br>um you can achieve so much more because<br>you've actually started to value every<br>single essence of your organization<br>which i think would ultimately<br>contribute to higher productivity i know<br>people work long hours in new zealand<br>where do we get more out of those long<br>hours well i think changing the whole<br>spectrum from thinking about risk all<br>the time in compliance and detail to<br>thinking about where is that stretch<br>target we could go for and then who<br>would be doing what to get there and<br>reinforcing accountabilities along the<br>way<br>um and then related to that is is time<br>the biggest uh limitation is time we all<br>think of money as being it but the<br>reality is that if you start off with a<br>a a strategy which has got a three year<br>term<br>and by the end you still haven't<br>achieved most of it you've lost real<br>time and quite frequently the reason why<br>people haven't achieved their strategies<br>is because they've spent so much time on<br>the detail and the risk at the beginning<br>rather than thinking about where do we<br>what are the steps we should be taking<br>to get to that strategy and then that's<br>that's lots and so the last thing is<br>strategy um boards really need to change<br>the the time<br>allocation and the agenda for strategy<br>to be at the priority have you seen<br>boards who are doing that really well or<br>is this something that we generally have<br>to lift the floor we have to lift the<br>floor on um the best<br>i've seen<br>is what we were trying to do with<br>transparency international because what<br>we did there is we not only had board<br>members but we have members with<br>delegated authority so every time<br>something came up that provided us a<br>stretch target instead of expecting the<br>board to do more we thought about who<br>could do that job well for us and we'd<br>find somebody to point to do that role<br>and so i think starting from an<br>organization with 32 members<br>i think the profile has grown quite<br>dramatically and there's recognition of<br>what transparency means to new zealand<br>as a result but if we'd started and done<br>everything incrementally in the normal<br>ways that boards i've been on work we<br>would still have maybe for lucky um a<br>few members and<br>a once a year agm and that really is<br>ridiculous because the opportunity for<br>new zealand given its<br>a public sector with very low corruption<br>and by the way i think that's an<br>important attribute about the business<br>school here in wellington that it is in<br>the city where there's such low<br>corruption<br>why wouldn't you think of a way to<br>actually harvest the benefits of that<br>um and so<br>that's what we did and that's what's<br>still being done under the the new<br>leadership of antoli and and julie<br>yeah more boards need to be discussing<br>uh transparency and ethics issues that's<br>for sure um<br>so i'm i want to come back to this point<br>about stakeholder shareholder as well um<br>in a moment so i'll come back to that<br>after we've spoken with melissa i'm also<br>interested in melissa's view<br>about can you set a three-year strategy<br>anymore<br>so or are we talking three minutes<br>because you know the world's changing so<br>fast yeah<br>um look i i just i wish i'd said most of<br>what um suzanne was saying there because<br>i do think that<br>for me i think governance is situational<br>and i think trying to kind of go oh this<br>is what it's like for every situation<br>and this is what good governance looks<br>like in every situation<br>is is pointless right so um you know i<br>designed and lead those strategy courses<br>for the iod and one of the big things i<br>think we get across is it's very<br>different working perhaps in a<br>family-owned business very different<br>again if you've got shareholders in the<br>business you know i was on the board of<br>jasmix we had 29 shareholders in the<br>business<br>um you run a business like that and<br>governance is very different stakeholder<br>management is very different when you've<br>got a lot of you know 10 percent of the<br>staff<br>own you it's very different and then we<br>took it to a point where we open share<br>ownership up to all of the staff and so<br>it changes the dynamic and the same if<br>it's an ewe organization you basically<br>got you know maybe a thousand people who<br>all tell you what they think or<br>um<br>and so and then public sector governance<br>again quite different and i think we we<br>shouldn't fall into this it's got to be<br>this way so you know thinking about does<br>the board own strategy or does the ceo<br>own strategy i think it's really<br>different depending on the size of the<br>organisation the competence if you've<br>got a if you've got a really weak board<br>the last thing you want is that board<br>driving strategy right um but equally if<br>you've perhaps got a weak executive<br>then the board kind of needs to step<br>over a little and get up and under them<br>and kind of offer them into what is good<br>strategy look like so i think they've<br>got to be a bit careful about sort of<br>going it lands this way or that way and<br>then the last thing i want to say is<br>that um like i played cricket and um and<br>i remember running into john wright in<br>an airport one day and we were talking<br>about teamwork<br>and he he looked at me like i was a<br> and he said to me you know<br>cricket's just not a team sport um he<br>said what it is is that you get all<br>these specialists and they go out there<br>and they play their positions so you<br>know you're like they're really good at<br>silly madonna or you're really good at<br>bowling and but you go out you just do<br>your thing and i've thought about that a<br>lot as metaphors for the boards i<br>haven't enjoyed the boards i haven't<br>enjoyed you've got the chair kind of<br>directing traffic and sending the oh<br>you're the lawyer we'll now ask you that<br>question or you're the accountant you'll<br>now deal with that one and and people<br>sort of like pop up like whack-a-mole on<br>their specific thing<br>whereas the ones i i love being on are<br>what i call learning boards where you<br>really<br>you're all trying to like you determine<br>the north star<br>and then you work with the executive to<br>keep that north star held and then<br>you're learning all the time but i think<br>those kinds of boards are still emergent<br>in new zealand we've still got a lot<br>more of the<br>pop-up when it's my turn boards and i'd<br>really i hope it's a generational thing<br>that as this new sort of generation and<br>it's it's weird where the 50 year olds<br>are young people right but but we're<br>that new generation coming through or<br>starting to yeah but you know starting<br>to change that dynamic yeah that's my my<br>10 cents with um so<br>there's hardly any rules in<br>actual legislation or regulation about<br>how we do our governance right yeah um<br>but somehow we all do it the same way<br>so you know pretty much most people<br>could go and go oh yes i expect to see<br>on the agenda there's going to be some<br>minutes there's going to be action items<br>there's going to be a few of these<br>things and we kind of fall into this<br>kind of model and board papers will come<br>out like this and we'll meet in that<br>kind of way<br>is that the future of governance what<br>you know you talked about kind of<br>stepping over this line is the line<br>between governance and management going<br>to be a lot more gray and porous now<br>you know how do we what's governance<br>going to look like what should it look<br>like for the future yeah i guess there's<br>kind of two things to unpack there one<br>is that you know when i first joined the<br>institute you weren't allowed to be on<br>advisory boards<br>and um and it was a black mark against<br>you you know you were either a director<br>or you weren't and like so these lines<br>have been moving for 20 years to be you<br>know they're not like new but the other<br>one is that i don't believe that we are<br>all doing it the same<br>i think you'll find that in um in family<br>owned businesses there's probably a lot<br>more rough and tumble around the table<br>than there are many of corporate boards<br>which i like being in private businesses<br>you know i have to realize private<br>for purpose businesses or community<br>owned for purpose businesses is my sweet<br>spot and i think when you if you're very<br>full purpose driven<br>our board papers tend to be designed<br>around our impact<br>and we might get to some of that<br>compliance stuff at the end of the<br>meeting rather than perhaps the<br>old-fashioned ones where you spend the<br>first hour and a half completely<br>mind-numbing<br>you know<br>going through the minutes and all that<br>stuff um so so i think those changes are<br>already out there a bit i don't know<br>yeah i agree i think boards are trying<br>to find ways to manage strategy better<br>and everybody's<br>testing different things i don't think<br>anyone's come up with the right thing<br>quite yet<br>uh one of the challenges always is that<br>you get onto a track with a strategy and<br>then some sort of crisis arises and all<br>of a sudden the whole board meeting is<br>turned over to that crisis rather than<br>the strategy and the strategy always<br>gets treated as something to get to when<br>you had time a kind of luxury rather<br>than the real thing<br>so even the boards that i've been on<br>where strategy is the main purpose they<br>still can't keep it there in the<br>forefront for long enough in my<br>experience so that<br>we're still very much experienced<br>experimenting i think but i agree with<br>melissa that while yes maybe in general<br>the formats are more or less the same<br>there are<br>lots of experiments happening about how<br>to use that format differently<br>one of the interesting things i find<br>though is that when you get a new<br>director<br>they immediately want to bring you back<br>to the formalities<br>yeah i found that and it's it's<br>fascinating so we're talking about the<br>idea of youth being wise and perhaps<br>more team focused but i haven't found<br>that i've found in fact that<br>it doesn't matter pretty much who you<br>bring on that the sense of<br>responsibility about being a board<br>member means that they think they need<br>some sort of framework in order to be a<br>board member<br>whereas what i'm trying to engender in<br>my boards is along the lines melissa was<br>just talking about which is we're there<br>for a purpose and we're there as a team<br>and let's share our ideas openly and<br>transparently about what we want to do<br>but let's make those ideas strategic and<br>purposeful yeah<br>yeah um it's<br>probably not a surprise that would be<br>the experience we hear particularly from<br>executive teams as well those new<br>directors often the ones<br>who sort of go have i had a bad<br>experience with the board it's my turn<br>to hold management to account<br>so we get a little bit of that coming<br>through but but also i guess maybe the<br>this kind of needing a structure that<br>kind of view and i think that's one of<br>the things that we want to unpick what<br>do we have to follow that structure does<br>good practice just basically mean<br>average practice is there something is<br>there a unique new zealand governance<br>opportunity here<br>that we should be creating<br>i was going to say that i think what<br>board papers say and what actually<br>happens in a board meeting at two<br>different quite different things and<br>actually a lot of the boards that i'm<br>now reporting to that it's mostly take<br>it as read and unless it's something<br>that comes up so we tend to pick on just<br>a couple of things that we really want<br>to get into and very much with the<br>national science challenge for example<br>very much about what are we<br>what can we do to really move this along<br>and what have you i mean i think rachel<br>should probably say about the um talk<br>about uh the future because my<br>experience of working with the<br>federation of maori authorities and<br>going to some of their conferences was<br>the first time i think i thought i saw a<br>thousand year cash flow projection um<br>you know there's i think that we have a<br>lot to learn um from tian maori<br>thank you<br>um it's interesting i was just going to<br>go back really quickly to the comment<br>about people the whack-a-mole<br>um because i interestingly one of the<br>boards that i sit on who has an<br>incredible chair said to me straight out<br>of the gates<br>we do not have a finance person we do<br>not have an audit person we do not have<br>a marketing person<br>you know essentially you better be ready<br>to be all of those people because that's<br>my expectation and she said you know<br>nothing irritates me more than people<br>expecting that they can skim the<br>financials because it's not really their<br>game so i love that that's a real really<br>amazing sign of i think a great board is<br>when everyone can contribute equally<br>um<br>look i i think that i i would i always<br>sort of rally against universality in<br>any forum and so i don't think there is<br>a new zealand way of necessarily doing<br>anything let alone at the board table i<br>think that they're like you know melissa<br>alluded to there are horses for courses<br>and there will be much as there is a way<br>that a company will do business i think<br>the board has to be representative of<br>that business and the way that they<br>conduct themselves and so yes in in our<br>business uh within kono um maori<br>organization family owned everyone at<br>that table is related it so it we do<br>start from a place of very high trust<br>and love and also a very collective<br>uh way of moving and thinking albeit<br>that that doesn't it never transforms<br>into groupthink because it's a dangerous<br>place to play but certainly there is a<br>collective way of moving um that that<br>leads you in great and beautiful<br>and often challenging places and i it<br>made me laugh when i read the netflix<br>case study that went around a couple of<br>years ago but you know how interesting<br>it was that the netflix world were<br>getting down and dirty and seeing what's<br>happening in the business i'm like<br>you could come to come to our business<br>you know the board know almost more than<br>any of us put together it's just<br>phenomenal and they and they do that one<br>it was a legislative um activity that<br>was put in place when maori authorities<br>were established that it was a committee<br>of management at the outset um and i<br>think still maybe but so they had to<br>conduct themselves in a way that was<br>different to a standard board but<br>also<br>as you are thrust into<br>commerce you pick up off the shelf<br>models of behaviour and models of being<br>that are<br>number one western in orientation and<br>very formulaic and very orthodox and you<br>pick them up because seemingly they work<br>and you apply them to your business but<br>i think as more businesses become<br>stronger and as boards become stronger<br>in their own capabilities<br>they start to fine-tune those practices<br>in a way that's more authentic to them<br>that makes them much better versions of<br>themselves so<br>you know i think even i would say that<br>not only in a maori organization but in<br>one of the bigger boards i'm on for a<br>publicly listed company there's a way to<br>be human about some of the very formal<br>and required procedures that you need to<br>undertake and that's the skill of a<br>chair yeah<br>i think that's a great insight isn't it<br>because that's isn't that why we have<br>boards in the first place because if it<br>was if there was a formula to it then<br>management could apply it right so<br>that's you know by definition uh we you<br>know no one ceo can have all the answers<br>otherwise we wouldn't need a board<br>that's why we need diversity and we need<br>a group around the table to do that um<br>i'm interested in this piece about<br>purpose so um<br>iod is part of a global network of<br>directors institutes and our brazilian<br>colleagues have got their conference<br>coming up and they've invited us to<br>attend online it's got this amazing<br>theme if purpose is the starting point<br>governance is the path<br>i'm interested in how important you know<br>what's the role of purpose and<br>governance melissa's raised it that's<br>where her she called it her sweet spot<br>those are the things she's interested in<br>you know we've we released a paper at<br>the iod recently stakeholders<br>shareholders and we got absolutely<br>savage by both ends you know<br>so in the last two weeks i've been<br>called everything from the vampires<br>collective um through to being a<br>dandelion being too soft so<br>you know it's kicked off this huge<br>debate with his purpose and and um and<br>where the stakeholders fit in this in<br>this purpose it probably comes back to<br>um suzanne's comment about love<br>and i i was in a meeting this week and i<br>was talking about you know what makes a<br>good boy was a good cheer and<br>and i think i used the word love about<br>ten times and richardson's like<br>was that too much for them i don't know<br>it's like i it is something i genuinely<br>feel like and i think that um<br>if you don't love the organization that<br>you are representative of or that you<br>are there to support and if you don't<br>love the industry that you have chosen<br>to spend your time in it's going to show<br>itself fairly quickly and part of that<br>is having a strong and clear and agreed<br>purpose about<br>why you even exist and why you are at<br>that table because it's a privilege to<br>be at the board table and it's a<br>responsibility so if you don't genuinely<br>throw all of yourself into<br>its<br>reason for being it will be a very hard<br>road and i think you'll only do a<br>percentage of the job that is actually<br>expected or required of you as a as a<br>director so<br>we don't call our shareholders<br>shareholders we call them owners<br>very deliberately because they are our<br>owners they own us as an organization<br>and many of them are within the business<br>and that's<br>amazing having owner operators in your<br>business they are they're the best<br>ambassadors<br>they<br>always are thinking a little bit<br>more than<br>uh everyone about how they can do<br>a better job what could be improved for<br>the most part it's what could be what<br>could we do better<br>which is which is good and a good<br>challenge but yeah we call them owners<br>because that's what they are to us<br>oh and whanau<br>selling views on purpose yes and i think<br>because most of the boards that i've<br>been<br>involved with um have been public sector<br>so the purpose is<br>quite a lot broader and it's it's very<br>much particularly the ones that we're<br>dealing with the moment it's very much<br>about impact what's our impact um we're<br>also<br>um the national science challenge is a<br>temporary organization so it's also<br>what's our legacy and i think we keep<br>coming back to that all the time in<br>terms of and it's and it's not about<br>commercialization and economic impact<br>it's about behavioral change it's about<br>capability building it's about those<br>things that actually are harder to<br>measure but probably will have a longer<br>term impact on our ability to to do you<br>know in our case you know innovate in<br>the physical sciences and engineering so<br>you know and i think the productivity<br>commission was the same it's it wasn't<br>about you know productivity per se it<br>was about the performance of the new<br>zealand economy for everybody's<br>well-being and so it's a much bigger i<br>mean actually i think productivity is is<br>a word that is badly used because i<br>think it's actually a really a word that<br>most businesses don't actually even<br>think about particularly unless they're<br>manufacturing it's much more about<br>performance and and profitability for<br>the for the whanau so<br>that so those boards i've been involved<br>in that's always been quite central and<br>we still have to tick the boxes for<br>making sure you're prudent and<br>transparent what have you but it's very<br>much about what can we do to improve our<br>impact in a variety of ways<br>suzanne your purpose led<br>by definition the work you do the<br>approach you take<br>where does purpose fit for with<br>governance and<br>organisational purpose well one of the<br>things about love<br>and i was thinking about this when i was<br>putting the word down on the paper as to<br>whether i should say that today so i<br>share<br>your perspective on that is it you can't<br>you've got to be careful because for<br>some people it does make you look like a<br>dandelion<br>but<br>i decided i would stick with it because<br>what i think good directors do<br>is they think about the board they're on<br>all the time<br>and i don't think there's enough respect<br>for the fact that that's how good<br>directors behave<br>i think quite often the ceo sees that as<br>interfering rather than supportive<br>and i'd like to think we can change that<br>perspective and sometimes i know that<br>there are board members who are<br>interfering<br>and who don't think before they jump<br>and who<br>don't seem to lack a sort of kinesthetic<br>awareness of their impact on others and<br>i think that's something which you're<br>working through with different courses<br>and training it the iod and i highly<br>regard those courses and why you're<br>doing it um and we need to be aware that<br>there are people like that but in<br>general the people i've worked with<br>really want to be<br>aware all the time of the purpose of the<br>board and when they see something<br>happening where they think they could<br>make a difference prevent it from going<br>the wrong direction or whatever<br>they want to be taken seriously at that<br>point and when you have a purposeful<br>board you've got a channel for that<br>energy to be<br>used productively so that people don't<br>get angry and<br>crisis driven and stressed they can<br>instead see that the energy they've put<br>into thinking about things in between<br>meetings is actually being generated and<br>to change um for the better for the<br>board yeah<br>conversation i have with my ceo<br>colleagues you can tell great board<br>members who are thinking about us<br>between board meetings<br>right we know those who are reading<br>their papers and and coming to meetings<br>and we know those who are genuinely<br>thinking about us in between what does<br>this mean for the iod what does this<br>mean for the business that i'm in then<br>when they're seeing things curating<br>things reading other things about that<br>kind of context so i think that's um<br>uh yeah indication of that they're<br>purposely done and committed to the<br>purpose of the organisation melissa they<br>said this is your sweet spot what's the<br>i just think often um boards don't spend<br>enough time<br>revisiting purpose and thinking about<br>purpose you know they take it for<br>granted and um<br>so i think about like i'm on the board<br>of a meat company and i don't know if<br>you like the meat industry is what<br>doesn't look like this you know like um<br>i am part of meet women which is<br>hilarious which is a global there's<br>still only about a thousand of us you<br>know that are in senior roles globally<br>in the meat industry right um but what i<br>love is i've joined an all-male board um<br>that are owners of the business um<br>and before i got there um they defined<br>their purpose as for the love of<br>ethically farmed lamb<br>and so we do we talk about love every<br>board meeting which i really like and we<br>we use that as our well you know the<br>north star right so we stop and we go<br>well so this last one board meeting we<br>can have a really deep dive saying into<br>regenerative agriculture through the<br>lens of love or we um you know very<br>early on we um we implemented um<br>like<br>what's now called social distancing but<br>we implemented that in our meat plants<br>before anybody else right or in the u.s<br>we discover that our employees there are<br>the only<br>meat packers in the u.s that get um<br>health insurance<br>right so you know so we take that love<br>and we we think then what what does that<br>mean what does it mean to love our staff<br>what does it mean to love our animals<br>that you know and we kill them right so<br>we have discussions about what is it to<br>kill something you know we're like and i<br>just think that's the work of the board<br>and that's where<br>you can pack around executives because<br>the executives often don't have the time<br>to stop and do that especially you know<br>with what they've had to deal with in<br>this last year with massive disruption<br>and so on<br>so so i yeah i think that that<br>that's part of that work of the board is<br>often they don't stop and do purpose and<br>i wanted to pick up on what suzanne said<br>about strategy and crisis because so i<br>was deputy chair of radio new zealand as<br>we went into the pandemic and<br>um and we had a brand new chair and it<br>was fascinating because you could see<br>him wanting to go off and come up with a<br>crisis plan<br>and and i said to him hey we've got a<br>strategy like this is the moment you<br>just double down on your strategy like<br>your strategy tells you what your theory<br>is of how to succeed here so we just<br>double down and i remember him looking<br>at me with this big grin and then you<br>know i've now rotated off the board and<br>recently we had another conversation and<br>he said like the freedom that that gave<br>of not having to now invent some crisis<br>plan because actually we had a really<br>good strategy and the strategy should<br>work in all circumstances do you know so<br>the strategy should be the thing you go<br>back to when you're busy should be the<br>thing you go back to when you're in<br>trouble<br>and so on but i see<br>i'm just going to say this like so my<br>first degree is actually from here too<br>in anthropology and i feel like as an<br>anthropologist i look at new zealanders<br>and we like diy and we like action<br>and so we we throw the strategy out<br>because we forget about it because we<br>just want to like do you know and i<br>think that's where we shoot ourselves in<br>the foot and i think if we come back and<br>go oh hang on what's our purpose<br>and then the strategy to me is like<br>what's our theory of change you know how<br>do we think that that purpose will be<br>achieved that's what the strategy is but<br>often what i see in new zealand<br>organizations it's not that it's here's<br>our to-do list<br>and so you know<br>in the courses we teach we're really<br>clear that strategy and strategic<br>planning are like on different universes<br>but i think most new zealand<br>organizations just like a plan<br>as opposed to stopping and thinking and<br>going well what's our theory of how this<br>business wins<br>so<br>you said it last year the pandemic lasts<br>felt like two years already maybe felt<br>like 10 the dog years right um do you<br>think have we learned something are<br>there some silver linings out of<br>being disrupted over the last 18 months<br>two years are we taking those lessons<br>forward or are we still wanting to<br>fix stuff with a<br>operational plan i i look it's going to<br>be different for different businesses<br>coming back to you know rachel's horses<br>for courses word you know it is it's<br>going to be it's going to be different<br>for different companies um i mean i'm<br>going to say something that's not going<br>to be very popular but some of the<br>problem that we have is that when we put<br>too many subsidies in i think we save<br>jobs but we also create zombie companies<br>so in a normal era companies would have<br>failed in this last couple of years<br>and i do think it's been in the public<br>interest to keep jobs however i think<br>we're going to see as you know in the<br>next year or so we're going to see a<br>number of companies go broke<br>um<br>that probably just should have yeah and<br>um we've become intolerant of failure<br>though haven't we we've become<br>intolerant of companies failing and<br>generally and no one likes failure i<br>don't think that's a new thing i i don't<br>think anyone likes failure no matter how<br>they can go on about like i mean i've<br>come out of startup and i can go on and<br>on about fast fail<br>only people who haven't failed think<br>fast fail is a good thing do you know<br>what i mean like nobody you're hey<br>no one wants to fail yeah yeah yeah<br>it hurts right yeah it hurts yeah yeah<br>yeah<br>stakeholders shareholders<br>well i thought about this because it was<br>one of your questions and gave us an<br>advance and uh<br>one of as an economist<br>i one of the things i have a big belief<br>in i don't believe in the market<br>solving all our problems but i do<br>believe there is a market out there<br>which has its own independent<br>momentum<br>and<br>part of the market is is your partners<br>so you know as a company or an<br>organization you know about your<br>directors you know about your staff<br>and you might have a definition of who<br>your customers are but i find very few<br>people actually think about who are<br>their other partners they're suppliers<br>they're distributors um<br>you know who who in the media pays<br>attention to you<br>and so you actually have a lot of<br>stakeholders i think<br>and generally speaking they're not as<br>visible as they could be when you're<br>thinking about your strategy<br>so i think stakeholders need to be<br>given a big tick along with shareholders<br>so you need to love your shareholders<br>but you also need to define and identify<br>love and maybe care for a bit more your<br>um stakeholders<br>rachel you talked about owners talked<br>about whanau<br>stakeholders shareholders there's a lot<br>of pressure sort of going on directors<br>are responsible for<br>everything<br>everything's a governance issue if you<br>think about it deeply enough right so<br>you're only five questions away from<br>going that's a governance question um<br>you know what's what's the board's role<br>in playing outside making profit<br>um it's issues and well i think as susan<br>said you're thinking about it all the<br>time so i think my expectation of<br>my fellow directors or or my board if<br>i'm sitting in a management position is<br>that they are<br>your number one advocates<br>and that if they see an opportunity that<br>can progress the<br>position of the business or the<br>performance of the business that they're<br>taking that on board and feeding it<br>through an appropriate manner so i think<br>that you need to love<br>your owners as much as you do your<br>stakeholders and recognize your place as<br>against them but it also has to be<br>mutually beneficial you know it's not<br>just a drag on your stakeholders i think<br>you have to add value to their space as<br>well and that's how you get the most<br>meaningful relationships generally<br>speaking but with regards to your<br>stakeholders specifically<br>and you know so beyond that to sort of<br>the duties of the board climate change<br>you know transparency in your supply<br>chain<br>you know you've in some of the enlisted<br>environments you're in you've got some<br>you know if you try to do a stakeholder<br>map that's a that's the planet it's<br>pretty amazing it's the planet yeah<br>how do you balance<br>all of that up i think carefully and<br>it's a bit of a divide and conquer and<br>um within the the warehouse we've got an<br>s well ordinarily we called sg but we've<br>dropped the g because we actually think<br>it's everyone it's not just the<br>governance scenario so it's ess and i<br>chair that subcommittee and it um<br>in our first meeting<br>um we spent an hour<br>in what i would call whakapanongatanga<br>you know people getting to know each<br>other i really wanted to tease out<br>why people opted into ess what was it<br>about that that attracted them because<br>there's lots of things you can do with<br>um unless you're actually required to be<br>there as part of the team um to do with<br>your time and just some really<br>amazing human stories show themselves<br>which is my point about no matter how<br>big the board and how big the company<br>and the regulations by which you um<br>might need to adhere we still are people<br>and there are reasons that we do things<br>and there are there are motivations<br>which makes us which make us better at<br>what we do and so that conversation got<br>into people's upbringings and<br>their exposure to poverty or their<br>positions on inequity or pollution where<br>they grew up in cities and watched those<br>very cities kind of consume themselves<br>which is a long way of saying i think<br>that<br>the board<br>has to be wholly invested in every<br>element of the business but recognize<br>where it's better that they take pole<br>position or they get in and unders<br>melissa said in support management and<br>their ability to to advance any part of<br>the cause<br>any comments on<br>yeah the the stakeholder things again<br>the public sector organizations you know<br>everybody is your stakeholder as people<br>were saying but i think also<br>you know particular commission's not<br>actually a really big organization<br>neither is the national science<br>challenge we can't actually achieve what<br>we want to achieve by ourselves so<br>you're really part of an ecosystem so<br>it's actually<br>um you know trying to be as<br>collaborative as possible and supportive<br>i think rather than seeing everybody in<br>the system as a competitor i think has<br>been quite key to actually thinking a<br>bit more about that line of sight to<br>impact is not straight from our<br>organization it's going to have to be a<br>collective effort and<br>and so i've been really enjoying that<br>side of things actually getting over<br>this new zealand intense interest in<br>being competitive as opposed to thinking<br>about from a more new zealand point of<br>view and particularly in the public<br>sector yeah yeah it's probably um some<br>lessons a few of us in the<br>not-for-profit sector need to learn<br>instead of starting our own little<br>individual charities easiest place in<br>the world to start a charity we're very<br>generous kiwi folk with our time and<br>with our money but a little more<br>collaboration not necessarily a straight<br>line from our own organization we might<br>achieve the purpose a little bit more<br>but that's my soapbox for another day<br>a few questions coming through uh so<br>thank you for that<br>question here what are some of the<br>diversity metrics gender ethnicity<br>overall across new zealand boards do we<br>have a new zealand studies on<br>improvements in business performance<br>with more diverse governance so all<br>female panel do we have a view on uh<br>diversity<br>and the benefits of that in terms of<br>improvement on on business performance<br>i would i would count this as one of my<br>whack-a-mole questions this is one i get<br>often<br>is diversity good for business quack<br>quack the answer is yes does it<br>does anyone have a longer answer than<br>just yes<br>well the board i'm reporting to at the<br>moment is um only got four members at<br>the moment we're short one but there's<br>50 50 mari and um tango to<br>and um and 75 female and we're having<br>great fun<br>so it's still yes yeah yeah yeah<br>no no none others i mean i think that<br>one of the things i love having around<br>the table are young people and<br>whether they're future directors and<br>senior execs in their own businesses but<br>young to the world of governance or they<br>are genuinely um young<br>and my perspective on that changes year<br>on year so what represents young but you<br>know having those really interesting<br>voices at the table um but also making<br>sure it's a very safe environment for<br>them to give their perspective because<br>it can be i think sometimes when new<br>directors come in and they do try to<br>bring you back to the rules it's because<br>i think they're scared uh you know<br>that's a pretty intimidating environment<br>in which you find yourself and you've<br>read the four pillars and you're all<br>ready and you know and if they don't do<br>it in the order in which you've read it<br>um there's a moment of shock because<br>you're not quite sure what comes next<br>but having young<br>interested interesting voices at the<br>table um you know you've just got to<br>have them there it makes you better as a<br>more experienced director to have them<br>there yeah<br>beside any comments on<br>diversity metrics you know in the new<br>zealand context we it's very difficult<br>we've only really got publicly available<br>information for nzx and for state sector<br>um which is why a lot of information<br>goes their state sectors hit 50 they had<br>a target you know they set a clear<br>target and they were able to achieve<br>that in terms of gender they've only<br>just started measuring ethnicity<br>and so you know we'll start to see a<br>little bit more of that in state sector<br>but we don't even have that information<br>across<br>most of our boards right because um so<br>yeah um suzanne any i think the fact<br>that you've got that information it'll<br>be good to see that out there a bit more<br>from the institute<br>i'm a big believer in diversity<br>and i'm also<br>you i think you need both targets and<br>quotas if we're going to get there<br>as rachel said when you've got the<br>experience of diversity you know how<br>well it works<br>and what has been missing when it wasn't<br>there but those boards that don't have<br>it i think of them a little bit like a<br>rubik cube<br>is you<br>you probably won't find any board these<br>days where somebody doesn't say they<br>want diversity but there sure are a lot<br>of boards out there that don't have it<br>to this day<br>and i think it's because when everyone<br>looks alike<br>when they come to think of the next new<br>board member they tend to choose someone<br>that looks like them<br>um and<br>if they don't actually move aside<br>and make a space for that new person to<br>come in then the space never arises and<br>i've just been waiting for so many years<br>now<br>and<br>you know one of your questions was<br>what is board going to look like in 50<br>years<br>and i realize i've been on boards now<br>for nearly 40<br>and a lot of things haven't changed in<br>those 40 years so i think particularly<br>with diversity because it is so<br>important and such a powerful thing<br>we need to think much more seriously<br>about both targets and quotas yeah<br>there's a some feedback on that question<br>um<br>i'd be interested to get your views on<br>let's say that the evidence is mixed on<br>business performance in regards to<br>diversity i'm not sure i'd necessarily<br>agree with that comment there's some you<br>know there's some uh measures about does<br>it impact on share price<br>but is that the measure is that the<br>measure of success uh but how do you<br>integrate how do you get the benefits of<br>that diversity i guess i don't think new<br>zealand's done this research but there's<br>um i mean there's a mountain of<br>international research and it's not<br>mixed um the mountain of international<br>research shows that<br>um the more women that you put on the<br>board the better the financial<br>performance of the organisation<br>they've shown that um like i<br>taught yesterday i taught the digital<br>transformation course for iod and one of<br>the case studies we do is we look at<br>disney's board and um disney went out<br>very very specifically and designed the<br>most diverse board they could get and so<br>they did that based on ethnicity based<br>on age based on gender and based on<br>sexual orientation<br>and<br>and they've been one of the highest<br>performing consistently boards in the us<br>they took a 10 billion hit last year in<br>revenue and it made almost no difference<br>to the business because since they<br>recruited this board the growth has been<br>so phenomenal and<br>and i i think you know and there are<br>there are case studies from the the<br>nordic countries where they put in um<br>quotas and shown productivity and<br>profitability um massively increase and<br>there's no other correlation so so i<br>agree like i think new zealand um we are<br>only going to have to do it we're going<br>to have to put on quotas and um it's not<br>something i would have said 10 years ago<br>but i think we have to do that but the<br>other thing that i would say is that as<br>a board member is picking up on what you<br>said as a board member you've got a huge<br>responsibility so so pretty much every<br>board i've been on for the last 15<br>actually 20 years because it started<br>with family planning 20 years ago<br>i have um over time helped to create<br>associate roles where we bring in young<br>people who would not normally get a<br>place or we bring in people for career<br>development in order to do that and you<br>know um and you see that it works and<br>and beef and lamb did a great job of<br>bringing<br>mostly women into those roles and then<br>pushing them out and we're thinking<br>about how we build a whole sector not<br>just a pipeline for ourselves but say<br>for the rural sector how do we build<br>that pipeline and so when i came off the<br>beef and lamb board i was their first<br>independent i push really hard to be<br>replaced by someone who's talking to<br>whenua because that's they don't get<br>elected and you know you have to kind of<br>and then the same when i came off a<br>government board um<br>i did actually like have a terrible time<br>as the only woman on that board and and<br>um and i had a chair who<br>really was the most sexist sort of<br> i probably ever worked with to<br>be fair and when the<br>i know and the minister the minister<br>said to me well do you want to start you<br>know do you want to come back and i'm<br>like no i said but you have to put two<br>women on this board you can't just have<br>one be the sacrificial lamb and bless<br>them the next chair is a woman and there<br>are more women on that board and i think<br>you we also have to call it out i think<br>often as women we just suck it up and<br>there's so there's a couple of things<br>there there's who are we putting a hand<br>down and pulling up<br>and how we're thinking about that beyond<br>just gender but also what ethnicities<br>we're pulling up what sexual<br>orientations we're pulling up whatever<br>it is so how do we do that<br>um how do we build that into the culture<br>of the board and i talked about like<br>learning boards learning boards think<br>about<br>okay who don't we have here can we co-op<br>them somehow can we bring them in<br>another way and i think that's becoming<br>i think<br>as somebody who<br>you know would obviously be a recipient<br>you know maori woman commercial you're<br>going to fit into some kind of you know<br>if it is a quota scenario<br>and<br>and it happens there are occasions when<br>you're invited to do things when you're<br>invited quite obviously because you're a<br>maori woman<br>and increasingly the maori women at the<br>end of those invitations are saying no<br>thank you<br>because<br>there are ways and ways to to<br>to extend those invitations and it is if<br>it is obviously so someone can tick<br>their box of diversity that's not a<br>great way<br>to enter a situation it's not it doesn't<br>feel great to be the recipient of that<br>invitation<br>so i think that we have to think really<br>really carefully about how we go about<br>extending or forcing the hand of boards<br>to be better and and and think more<br>smartly about diversity and inclusion<br>and it can't be we've got yeah you're<br>right you know the um<br>noah's ark yeah you know a couple of<br>those a couple of those couple of those<br>great we're away it has to be better we<br>we are better than that as as<br>an economy and as business people and as<br>governors and directors we are much<br>better we're much smarter than that and<br>you can see them coming a mile away when<br>they are<br>um genuine in their intent to want to be<br>better and they know that you have<br>something that isn't at that table<br>already as against necessarily just<br>filling a seat so i just think as we go<br>through that process and being better<br>then we can be better yeah so how do we<br>encourage<br>should have been thinking about that's<br>not all that science not science on<br>boards you know we did it we did a piece<br>with the royal society about<br>trying to get science back into<br>boardrooms you know climate change hello<br>can we need science in the boardroom um<br>so you know that that's an aspect of<br>diversity how do we get new faces new<br>thoughts into borderline well that's one<br>of the reasons that i first um went on<br>the iod course probably 20 maybe 30<br>years ago<br>years ago because it was going to there<br>was a push then to try and get more<br>scientists on the board but then there's<br>it's a bit more than just the science<br>though i think it's actually making sure<br>you've got people there who can really<br>critique and question and it doesn't<br>necessarily have to be a scientist<br>although i think there's a lot of value<br>in in science and engineering<br>particularly on on boards um<br>so i think that's that's i think the<br>role that's important that that it's<br>more<br>being evidence-based i think rather than<br>just um<br>yeah and i think the the critic about<br>that we've got to we put a rangatahi<br>person on our board and uh she's picked<br>us up on some things that you you just<br>take for granted you take as you've been<br>placed throughout she's she said well<br>why why do we have to do it this way why<br>can't we do it that way and it's been<br>really really good i agree with that<br>from a point of getting that sort of<br>it's that it's that getting out of<br>what you do end up getting a bit of<br>group think it's making sure they've got<br>enough diversity in there um and and and<br>those sort of people who will go out and<br>do some research on it and think this is<br>really interesting haven't circulate<br>that sort of stuff to the board and i<br>think very old not very old gosh i don't<br>people don't think about them<br>specifically but we have komato on our<br>board and and you know<br>he's very very young and then he's very<br>very old and i think that the<br>contributions that they make are<br>profound you know they're very still and<br>very quiet for the most part of the<br>meeting but when they speak it's it's<br>the<br>it's because of the ultimate mic drop<br>moment because if you're anywhere near<br>off course you are immediately snapped<br>back into<br>you know the purpose like if you need a<br>wayfinder<br>i've got a question here about<br>politics on a board<br>how do you understand the<br>the politics of governance and<br>uh and being in a successful race<br>you've got you just you just said you<br>had a very you know political kind of<br>environment you know what how do you<br>manage your way through multiple<br>stakeholders and some of those pressures<br>ah i just think you have to be<br>really<br>poor or really honest about about what<br>your position is and i think that you<br>also can't have any ego if you have an<br>ego<br>either well generally it makes life hard<br>but at a board table it most certainly<br>that makes life hard i think that my<br>experience of of of my board is that<br>everyone recognizes what their<br>responsibility is for this moment in<br>time and it's not about us it's about<br>who's coming through in the future<br>generations so it is our responsibility<br>to make sound strong<br>uh decisions now that allow for a<br>prosperous future for our<br>grandchildren's grandchildren and beyond<br>you know and that's that purpose and<br>that's that vision about and that<br>collective agreement about what we're<br>here to do and we're here to<br>and i should say i've just finished with<br>cornell but i still feel very much a<br>part of the whanau because<br>too but<br>our our purpose is to preserve and<br>enhance our tongue our treasures be that<br>people or place for the benefit of<br>present and future generations we know<br>that and i could<br>you know in my every fiber i know it and<br>i know that all of our board do and our<br>owners and our team and everyone has a<br>different relationship to that purpose<br>but it makes the very hard decisions a<br>piece of cake<br>yeah<br>yeah i love that in terms of the the ego<br>and the listening right because they're<br>um you know by by definition board<br>members need to be able to listen<br>because they don't hold the individual<br>responsibility<br>so you know that's um absolutely<br>critical that we have directors who can<br>be prepared to change their position<br>on issues which you know if you come in<br>with ego and thinking you're just<br>imparting wisdom that's hard<br>i mean i'm i've often been the first<br>independent on on a board and a number<br>of those have been membership type<br>organisations and<br>you know i think about membership type<br>organisations i kind of think you get<br>elected what i call a local beauty<br>parade do you know so<br>often what you end up with is really<br>good people but they're elected because<br>they're electable<br>and then you get say you know they cover<br>the country because they're regional<br>reps and then they've got quite a lot<br>that they have to carry<br>because they carry the national piece<br>but they also they've been elected by<br>their local locality of some sort right<br>so you know so that if they they go to<br>town in timaru or something everybody at<br>the supermarket has a go at them so<br>there's sort of big play in little p<br>politics going on and i think that's<br>again where using independence can be<br>quite useful in having the right balance<br>particularly say in the primary sector<br>where you get enough voices from outside<br>because<br>we've got some really big issues we're<br>grappling with in the primary sector<br>whether it's climate or water<br>or um you know wage issues kind of<br>equity and we've got a bunch of stuff<br>around like modern slavery and imports<br>of materials and there are some really<br>big issues and those are not always the<br>issues that you get like you know<br>someone with a finger at you at the<br>supermarket right and so i think having<br>that having some independence actually<br>helps to take the conversation<br>one step higher sometimes and then the<br>other bit which has probe in the lesson<br>that i've had to keep learning is just<br>to keep looking at my fellow board<br>members with as much generosity as<br>possible<br>and so when i find that i disagree with<br>them on my whole<br>social theory do you know i have them<br>perhaps you know what i mean like i i<br>have a i come from a different<br>um<br>uh<br>you know i mean my family are very<br>liberal my parents found it at madness<br>international in new zealand my dad's a<br>human rights lawyer like i come from a<br>particular world view<br>that is not the same as often the people<br>i find myself in the boardroom with and<br>i think coming to that with a real<br>generosity and a sense of inquiry like<br>what is it that makes you think that all<br>government's a waste of time or what is<br>it that makes you think that um you're a<br>self-made man and everybody else should<br>stand on their own two feet or like<br>what's underneath it and i think that<br>that inquiry helps<br>to be able to find the bridges and to go<br>well you know what like future<br>generations that you say<br>all of those people no matter if i<br>disagree with them about their social<br>theory or what the role of government is<br>or something else um they actually want<br>a better world for their children for<br>their grandchildren<br>and so how do we keep coming back to<br>like their higher purpose<br>and connecting there but those i don't<br>think we should underestimate the<br>political<br>impacts particularly on those<br>organizations that have local elections<br>for something and it'd be the same if<br>it's you know i have never been on a<br>council you know like a regional council<br>or a city council or something but i<br>think it will be british you know it's<br>yeah yeah well two degrees of separation<br>in new zealand right we're all connected<br>yeah<br>but just that generosity and inquiry<br>excuse me i'm just gonna um before jane<br>um pops up to finish up i'm gonna one<br>couple of very quick quick fire question<br>for you what can the university<br>wellington school of business and<br>government do to support governance in<br>aotearoa and new zealand what would you<br>like what's the challenge you're laying<br>down<br>they can work closely with the institute<br>of directors as setting who sets the<br>standards for what governance should be<br>in new zealand<br>but i think we need a lot more people<br>being educated<br>in governance uh at all the way through<br>in a sense their<br>academic careers<br>one of the big challenges i think with<br>this political<br>challenge that we've been put around the<br>board table is that<br>most people have been educated to be<br>good at something<br>and so they may be a good scientist or<br>they may be a good<br>technologist<br>and<br>regrettably they don't seem to<br>communicate as well as they could with<br>other disciplines<br>and so just starting with the concept of<br>governance is a cross-disciplinary issue<br>and how do we incorporate that into all<br>of our academia and training so by the<br>time they get to you um wanting to be<br>directors they're actually ready for<br>that broader conversation to take place<br>around purpose at the board table great<br>um for me it would be to really broaden<br>the definition of what capable looks<br>like i think that we get pretty stuck in<br>what an agreed version of capable and<br>increasingly<br>i just don't i just can't um<br>believe that we we don't go out of our<br>way<br>um or that we haven't already to<br>redefine what capable looks like and um<br>in my new role i'm sitting in an office<br>down on federerson street and it's a<br>consultancy business<br>of about 30 young<br>maori<br>tadeo native<br>you know degrees up their arms<br>incredible minds now<br>you know where are they and how do we<br>lift up those kids because they<br>are doing phenomenal work and they're 30<br>of what i think would be about you know<br>3 000 and if we can broaden our<br>definition of what capable looks like<br>they'll they'll crush it<br>so i just think we need to just you know<br>as we're training people into the space<br>open their minds to to new ideas of<br>capable and<br>not see it as a comment on their own<br>capabilities it's just an and and<br>it's an addition to what's capable yeah<br>get those doors open those fences um<br>fantastic thank you that um we could<br>have gone on for another hour lots of<br>questions and lots of things coming<br>through but um i really appreciated your<br>time this morning thank you as we've<br>adapted to<br>uh this sort of uh world of distancing<br>thanks kp and thank you to all our<br>fabulous panelists this morning

boards to<br>love to whack-a-mole to<br>yeah just very inspiring lots of ideas<br>and a good challenge put out to the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government to make sure we take a<br>cross-disciplinary<br>work across those faculties in the<br>university to get governance in there<br>into<br>all our programs so<br>thank you for joining us online and um<br>or if you're watching
