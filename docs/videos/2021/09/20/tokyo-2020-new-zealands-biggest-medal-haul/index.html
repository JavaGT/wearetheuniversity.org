in<br>dunedin we'll take care of opening up<br>your speaker when that occurs<br>so thank you all for joining us it's a<br>pleasure to have you here this evening<br>and an extremely warm welcome and and<br>heartiest congratulations to hamish and<br>also to karen for the performance of the<br>team hamish clearly for your performance<br>this time round but i think um it's it's<br>a lifetime of achievements too so our<br>warmest congratulations to you<br>thank you should i take the floor<br>take the floor too please all right um<br>yeah so obviously my name's danish bond<br>um<br>my connection to otago is<br>primarily i was born there um<br>back in 1986 so i spent my first few<br>years in dunedin and then moved to mid<br>canterbury before going back to dunedin<br>to board an attorney boys high school<br>where i spent<br>all my school at my high school years<br>and<br>following my time there i<br>did two<br>second semesters<br>at otago university<br>i did second semesters because during<br>the first semester i was involved with<br>age grade rowing teams based at lake<br>carapiro and cambridge<br>so that's i guess my link to the<br>university<br>and obviously<br>have abused used and abused their own<br>facilities on the otago harbour over the<br>years<br>pretending to be a close alumni um but<br>the glenn sinclair who's in charge there<br>he's always had the door open for me<br>when i need it<br>um<br>and yeah so i have close ties with<br>dunita and my parents<br>live there my older brother lives there<br>and you know don't get down there too<br>often but um<br>largely due to uh<br>i guess time constraints and<br>opportunities but um hopefully going<br>forward there'll be there'll be a few<br>more<br>myself at the moment<br>obviously just returned from the tokyo<br>olympics<br>trying to work out what i'm doing with<br>my life<br>so currently i guess somewhat<br>um<br>i i do have a part-time position with<br>forsyth bar<br>who have been obviously dunedin<br>originated not necessarily based i<br>suppose based company<br>and<br>have always been very supportive of me<br>which is which has been fantastic<br>um<br>and<br>yeah just<br>i suppose i have three<br>now three children um all under four so<br>fairly busy on the home front and my<br>wife<br>uh is currently on maternity leave we<br>had our<br>most recent uh son uh a few weeks ago<br>five weeks ago<br>while i was in quarantine coming back<br>from the olympics so yeah it's all it's<br>been it's been all go for sure so we've<br>sort of been waiting to take our breath<br>but this recent lockdown um kind of<br>interrupted that uh but we're just sort<br>of getting back into a flow of what life<br>is gonna look like post<br>post olympics uh because it's certainly<br>been fluid for quite some time but um<br>yeah happy to share i guess my<br>experiences and<br>quite tropical talking to<br>as i just mentioned<br>um to jacinta they<br>are quite topical talking to american<br>based alumni as my wife and i are most<br>probably or not most probably definitely<br>going to be usa based from the mid<br>middle of next year she's taken up a<br>surgical fellowship at duke university<br>so that's for a minimum of 12 months and<br>perhaps looking for a further 12 months<br>in north america be it usa or canada so<br>um yeah quite interesting to touch base<br>i suppose with<br>familiar or yeah people with a similar<br>background um<br>and<br>yeah that's about me<br>thank you hamish<br>and uh and we we do appreciate that you<br>jump from you know the isolation of two<br>weeks on your own in a hotel room home<br>to a family of very excited and very<br>young<br>newcomers so thank you for giving us<br>your time this evening of course or<br>today for<br>you kieran yeah my friend over to you oh<br>kia ora tattoo everyone thanks um for<br>the opportunity to connect with um lots<br>of names i know on on the screen here<br>and and also really cool to be here with<br>hamish because um although he's<br>obviously got incredible prowess in the<br>in the water um and might not at all on<br>the athletic endeavour field our our<br>paths have crossed a lot over the years<br>and um you know in awe of his his<br>achievements in olympic and commonwealth<br>sports and facts which we'll talk about<br>yeah i've<br>really strong ties to otago and to<br>dunedin<br>i grew up<br>in clinton<br>which for those of you who are not too<br>sure is a mega metropolis<br>a place um<br>halfway between dunedin and invercargill<br>um my my um i was the youngest of a<br>family of six none of whom went to<br>university<br>so um not only was i actually a mistake<br>i think i was the one who was kind of<br>destined for that opportunity and<br>grabbed it with both hands so my<br>interest has always been in sport um<br>more particularly i think and kind of<br>imparting in the education side and and<br>leadership and development so<br>initially i went to otago university to<br>train in at phys ed school and um and<br>loved that opportunity um and i have to<br>say i would<br>say that the university of otago<br>actually had a profound impact on my<br>life because i think what you do is you<br>kind of grow up there<br>um because you meet new people and<br>lifelong friends and it kind of sets you<br>on a pathway<br>so i was really really grateful to the<br>university for that opportunity<br>um<br>unbeknown to me a few years later<br>after pursuing<br>i did physique teaching for a few years<br>and then<br>traveled overseas and came back and<br>started<br>working in sports leadership and sports<br>management which<br>although it was in the<br>late 80s<br>was actually just a really new thing<br>it would you know the new zealand sport<br>hasn't been professionalised for very<br>long at all and by that i don't<br>necessarily mean playing<br>players<br>and athletes i mean<br>actual administrators<br>and so that was a very new pathway in<br>new zealand unliken in the us where it's<br>you know there's layers of<br>um involvement by professional people<br>so i moved into sports management and i<br>guess you call it leadership and um<br>worked in the areas of gov for<br>government and sport for the minister of<br>sport<br>and an organisation which was called the<br>hillary commission which is now<br>sport new zealand so sort of those those<br>areas and also um where hamish and i our<br>paths crossed a few years ago was<br>in the high performance sort of<br>development pathway what we called the<br>academy sport<br>um at that time also it was based in<br>dunedin the south island academy sport<br>and i was a ceo there<br>and we hooked up and worked alongside<br>the university of otago<br>and at that stage i was fortunate to be<br>appointed to the council university of<br>otago council for um ten years actually<br>and really loved that 10 years<br>back living in dunedin and working<br>across the south island in new zealand<br>um and that was very much about<br>supporting athletes supporting coaches<br>you know the early days of us<br>sort of<br>again<br>i use the word loosely professionalizing<br>our<br>performance system in new zealand<br>so that was another time i connected<br>with the university of otago and um<br>and i guess you know was involved with<br>the building as a trustee for the<br>forsyth bar stadium<br>and worked alongside siri on edgar and<br>the four bar people so<br>all these networks are forever and<br>intertwined so<br>um<br>yeah and now obviously in this job new<br>zealand olympic committee probably don't<br>have so much direct involvement with<br>otago or the university however always<br>um very soft place in my heart and<br>and also all the kind of people just<br>keep reconnecting<br>so my job presently is um<br>a retiring well not actually i've been<br>told i think it's retreating um ceo um<br>from in the new zealand olympic<br>committee role a job i've been in for<br>just under 11 years<br>so it's well timed to to move move into<br>a different phase<br>and also great for the organization<br>because there's some really exciting<br>sort of<br>um i guess changes coming around olympic<br>pathways so it's a good time for me to<br>to look at the next step so<br>so thanks jacinta that's a little bit<br>about<br>me and otago<br>thank you karen and and actually now you<br>mention it i still have a letter opener<br>from your time as the private secretary<br>to the minister of sport so i believe<br>it's a bellamy's uh letter opener so<br>some things never disappear<br>oh thank you<br>so let's turn to talk about tokyo<br>and tokyo 2020 as it was in 2021<br>um and thinking about the<br>new zealand team<br>clearly a distinct occasion and i would<br>say here in the us we had 24 7<br>television coverage and and i'm<br>delighted to see i think we saw every<br>new zealand sports event so we were very<br>fortunate but it felt different as a<br>viewer it felt like the team dynamic<br>itself was incredibly strong<br>and i wonder perhaps starting with you<br>hamish how would you describe<br>the culture and just just the<br>relationship between people on the new<br>zealand team what what made it good or<br>different for you<br>uh yeah i mean it was different the<br>olympics themselves were different from<br>me on multiple levels um<br>primarily going in uh in a boat<br>it almost flipped it back to my first<br>experience at the olympics at beijing<br>where i was in a men's four um<br>and<br>then the subsequent<br>obviously london and rio with eric we<br>went in as heavy favorites uh<br>expectations were to win or fail um and<br>really<br>quite different i know all we could do<br>was meet expectation and that's i guess<br>the tough part about being at the top of<br>your game is that it's very hard to<br>exceed expectation really all you can do<br>is hit your target and that's and that's<br>it so you sort of along with that you<br>just<br>you know you're<br>my principle of motion post london and<br>rio was just a sense of relief<br>um that you know we met our own and<br>others expectations whereas going into<br>tokyo<br>uh with the men's eight a project that i<br>wouldn't say i initiate but definitely<br>resuscitated um<br>when i came back to the sport after my<br>stint in cycling post rio<br>um<br>i you know the expectations were quite<br>different both from ourselves and<br>certainly externally i don't think there<br>were many expectations or not certainly<br>high expectations<br>um<br>so<br>there was the first point of difference<br>uh secondly obviously um<br>covered<br>obviously overhanging every uh<br>logistical decision um<br>and certainly there was a lot of work<br>done i suppose karen can talk about that<br>more in terms of<br>our<br>logistics on the ground and how that<br>operated but in terms of the team<br>dynamics and culture<br>there's been a definite there's been a<br>noticeable shift from<br>uh since i don't know karen compared to<br>talk about it as well whether it's a rob<br>waddell thing or just a general<br>evolution but a certain shift in<br>the<br>mindset and operation i suppose of the<br>olympic team<br>after london i think london was quite<br>performance based<br>but<br>certainly<br>rio and tokyo<br>felt quite a tight-knit team very<br>professional<br>um<br>very respectful<br>just far more objective i suppose you<br>know like people<br>knew what they were doing knew what they<br>were about<br>and with the with obviously the covert<br>disruptions um<br>and<br>being far more<br>it was funny because you were sort of<br>obviously meant to be social distancing<br>and all that and there was that within<br>our own we bubble you know we were<br>largely sticking to our our sporting<br>groups and trying not to mix and mingle<br>as much as much as possible uh<br>within the wider new zealand team but in<br>saying that there was a definite um<br>team camaraderie i think that that uh<br>yeah getting yeah well<br>not over there wasn't exactly<br>adversity to overcome you know like<br>everything worked pretty seamless but<br>there was just that overarching sense of<br>uh of a higher degree of camaraderie<br>amongst the team i think this year<br>um<br>and<br>certainly the people involved i think<br>you if you look at the senior athletes i<br>wouldn't put myself<br>necessarily there in terms of uh<br>uber team guy maybe i am within my own<br>network and rowing and in the rowing<br>team but i don't put myself forward<br>necessarily and the wider new zealand<br>olympic team but there certainly were<br>those people who<br>do that job well my my stand-in flag<br>bearer david nika i think did a great<br>job um on that front obviously led from<br>the front from the athlete support<br>people and karen could probably talk<br>about that more i think they do a great<br>job and<br>making all the athletes feel comfortable<br>i mean it's not a big deal for me but if<br>i wind back the clock to beijing you<br>know it's my fourth olympics so i'm<br>relatively versed in what's going on but<br>on the flip side of that there's a lot<br>of people who have<br>far less experience and<br>i think<br>the way that they operate<br>to me it almost seems it's bordering on<br>overbearing and too much to me because i<br>am comfortable and familiar but i could<br>certainly appreciate for the more<br>inexperienced members that would have<br>been really welcome<br>um just to have those friendly familiar<br>faces so<br>um yeah i think the senior athletes uh<br>did a great job and um across all the<br>sports and and and bringing everyone<br>together and i suppose that made up<br>somewhat for<br>not being able to go out and support uh<br>our fellow members because that's the<br>principal difference with the olympics<br>compared to our general competition is<br>that you get the opportunity to mix and<br>mingle and support uh other other codes<br>whereas<br>obviously at a world-renowned champs<br>it's just the people that we know on a<br>daily basis whereas at the olympic games<br>you know they said there's generally<br>that opportunity to get out to other<br>sports and support and<br>once your competition's finished<br>typically um so that was sort of taken<br>away so that i guess that got<br>focus<br>put a put into focus just on our own<br>team building you know like that wider<br>instead of going out to venues you know<br>like that that sort of was focused<br>either on<br>social media and um<br>through telecommunications i guess<br>uh and also just in the in the building<br>it was just that vibe so it was quite<br>cool yeah everyone was a it was a pretty<br>kumbaya attitude which like i i<br>i<br>i'm<br>yeah like i like a little bit of kumbaya<br>but sometimes<br>you're a southern man hamish<br>that's pretty much it yeah yeah<br>that's all i like<br>as long as it doesn't get in my way<br>here you go<br>and and karen thinking about it from<br>sort of the logistics and all the things<br>that we often don't get to see as as<br>observers of the games what stood out<br>for you<br>uh both in terms of how things work very<br>well and what was different or<br>challenging this time<br>i almost feel sick thinking about it to<br>be honest because it's such a big<br>question i um<br>it's hard to just know where to start<br>but um what i would say is that um just<br>to jump on to the couple of points that<br>hamish was making um<br>it was really interesting as things<br>played out um<br>because this olympic team was<br>in 20 2020 was going to be the new<br>zealand it's the hundred years of a new<br>zealand olympic team competing you know<br>at the olympic games so tokyo 2020<br>was a milestone<br>year<br>was to be a milestone year um<br>for many many reasons and<br>i recall<br>our sort of team support people led by<br>rob waddell shifter mission came back<br>from the last site visit in march<br>2020<br>and just<br>aside from there was some smatterings of<br>covert which we thought what is this<br>thing<br>um<br>just were feeling yep<br>you know we've got this thing<br>you know everything the venues are ready<br>they were stunning the village was ready<br>it was amazing we had a new zealand<br>house set up which is for our friends<br>and family and supporters and<br>merchandise to sell and just an amazing<br>set up there it was just utopia in terms<br>of<br>olympic planning<br>and then day by day you know<br>it started to unravel<br>very quickly because in fact the actual<br>games were postponed at the end of march<br>so if we think about that pathway from<br>utopia to<br>you know is this thing ever going to<br>happen it was a very quick dismantling<br>exercise<br>and funnily enough most of those plans<br>aside from the hardware that existed in<br>tokyo itself and those venues were<br>stunning<br>you know every venue you saw<br>i mean with people it would have been<br>something else<br>yeah no everything about it was so<br>so prepared but then everything started<br>to come crumbling down every every plan<br>every piece of operation so we basically<br>had to go right back to square one so<br>once we kind of had got through the<br>the stage of okay these things aren't<br>happening and trying to get<br>you know good sustained communications<br>with athletes and just keeping everyone<br>focused it was then honestly god like<br>climbing a mountain that felt like it<br>was getting higher every day and i don't<br>mean to be dramatic but it was kind of<br>getting to that point when we realized<br>that<br>in order to do all of these<br>countermeasures all the planning and get<br>athletes vaccinated and tested<br>from around the world to get into tokyo<br>to compete and be the best they could be<br>and do all of their preparation justice<br>meanwhile all the qualifications were<br>changing<br>we kind of had to rebuild and do our<br>normal olympics which to give you an<br>idea<br>logistically it's about it's a massive<br>undertaking it's about eight and a half<br>thousand bed nights just for the team so<br>it's like kind of running a hotel<br>it's around about 20 20 21 000 i think<br>pieces of equipment and clothing that<br>needs to be<br>kitted out on people<br>we have a long list of people<br>potentially a thousand people who could<br>go to the olympic games and that narrows<br>down to<br>around about 220 so one in five that<br>start that journey about one and five<br>get there<br>about 20 ton of<br>gear and then there's all the other bits<br>and bobs so<br>in terms of the logistical kind of side<br>of it it's big<br>but then it became obvious to us that we<br>also had to have<br>around about 1500 vaccines for people<br>across 25 different countries of the<br>world<br>we then needed to have<br>time sensitive<br>pre-testing for athletes<br>everyone had to have three of them<br>before they landed across 25 countries<br>in the world<br>and then we kind of also had to think<br>about miq<br>and getting into miq and planning miq<br>getting charter planes to get home<br>and all these things on top of just what<br>was<br>a normal big gig<br>and as well as that then thinking about<br>um<br>all of the friends and family who had<br>booked and paid to go to the olympics<br>unbundling all of that which still was<br>unfunded so it really just felt like the<br>mountain was getting getting higher and<br>higher and so what i think it did and i<br>think this is what covert does for us<br>all is it focuses us really back on what<br>matters<br>and when you really come back to the<br>core of what matters it's all about the<br>athletes<br>and it's all about keeping things you<br>know do things simple things really well<br>and work with people communicate with<br>people because while many of the<br>athletes are in sports like rowing<br>um many of them are not<br>so some of these athletes are going<br>there you know with a volunteer coach<br>people are taking time off they don't<br>have any financial support mom and dad<br>have mortgaged their house to get them<br>there so you know we have a very diverse<br>athlete community and there were 21<br>different sports represented at at tokyo<br>so<br>i i think so in the end it was a very<br>different games for all of those reasons<br>and<br>i think there was some<br>unexpected<br>positive consequences and one of them i<br>think cameras you touched on there which<br>is<br>probably because athletes<br>and people couldn't turn it out to their<br>family and out to their friends and they<br>turned towards each other and<br>and there was it felt to me like there<br>was a big build of um<br>of of character<br>and of culture<br>and new zealand's personality shone on<br>the world stage across those different<br>sports<br>and we actually saw<br>successes in sports that we haven't i<br>was<br>um in gymnastics and trampolining we've<br>never had a middle and trampolining<br>before but something like tennis and<br>men's doubles i mean the last medal in<br>tennis was anthony wilde and we all know<br>that was a long time ago<br>so there was some real breakthroughs and<br>i'm i mean if you said what am i most<br>proud of i'm i'm most proud of how<br>how how our team<br>represented our country<br>on the world stage and how through<br>some of the work that we did around<br>our hundred year<br>team celebrations<br>we had<br>through advice from tar derek ledelli<br>who is from nadi pero and a<br>well-renowned<br>um cultural and maori artist he he<br>worked on developing a haka for the new<br>zealand team because previously we used<br>other hakas or loaned or with approval a<br>haka<br>and a lot more cultural depth and um<br>i guess<br>thinking about our values and where did<br>we come what what was this hundred year<br>story about and what does the source<br>fund stand for<br>and who are we and what do we want to<br>look like on the world stage and<br>and i think it was just<br>those things elements came together<br>better than we expected because we<br>didn't think we're going to be able to<br>do a haka because we didn't think we<br>could kind of<br>do that<br>external kind of thing but we found a<br>way didn't we hamish outside there was a<br>lovely area that yeah i don't know i<br>think people just looked the other way<br>didn't they<br>and so i think to answer your question i<br>think in summary it was a very different<br>games<br>there it was sad there wasn't you know<br>amazing venues full of people and it was<br>sad for the tokyo um and japanese people<br>that that wasn't able a dream to be<br>realized<br>um but it was it produced to me<br>unprecedented benefits in terms of<br>i think new zealanders had forgotten<br>just how exciting and engaging the<br>olympics can be<br>and um and just really showed<br>what what we stand for i mean a country<br>the size of new zealand<br>ending up 11th on the on the<br>13th on the middle table<br>um<br>you know is an incredible achievement<br>out of 206 countries<br>so that's a big thing and the other<br>thing that i i really recall is um<br>just before the game started and the<br>secretary general of the who was<br>speaking<br>um and i was listening at an olympic<br>forum<br>and he was talking about the importance<br>of the olympic games for global the glo<br>the future of global interaction<br>and talking about the fact that<br>there is never no risk<br>there's only more risk or less risk<br>and<br>the the future of global interaction is<br>about how we learn to live with covert<br>and how we learn to come together<br>but stand apart to behave differently<br>and wear masks and<br>respect distance and<br>all of those things and in fact what the<br>what the olympics could do<br>and he hoped it would do<br>would show the world that this was<br>possible<br>and if you think about it<br>there were of all the delegates<br>and people that went into japan<br>0.02<br>got covert<br>0.2 of people from 206 countries<br>and i think<br>i think i'm right that most of those<br>that covered transmission occurred on<br>planes<br>right flying in<br>so what what what this was was actually<br>the global mountaintop for the world it<br>was a global an opportunity to show the<br>world that people can come together and<br>if they adhere and are disciplined and<br>strong<br>that there is a way forward and so i<br>think from a bigger global picture that<br>was it was pretty cool that's a great<br>point and and if i think about um<br>the comment you just made karen and and<br>the olympics perhaps becoming the model<br>for the way the the world will have to<br>operate you know for the foreseeable<br>future<br>i wonder what it does for the future of<br>top level sport in ateroa and<br>how do athletes<br>get those opportunities to get<br>experience and competition and and get<br>to be games ready<br>in the intervening years when travel and<br>access is probably very different to<br>what it was<br>and hamstring thinking you know with<br>with your<br>vision and with your experience in both<br>rowing and cycling your what do you see<br>as the pathway for high performance<br>sport in new zealand and and staying on<br>the world stage<br>uh<br>yeah i haven't i sort of was looking<br>towards tokyo and haven't put much<br>thought beyond that<br>um<br>i think<br>i would argue that there's<br>probably<br>i don't know maybe it's changing maybe i<br>just had another patch but i would say<br>that<br>a number of sports are still<br>thinking that it may go back to how it<br>was um<br>i would suggest<br>but i i i'm not in touch with management<br>karen might know more i don't know i i i<br>suspect it depends on<br>the sport<br>and the nature of their funding um you<br>know like if you're a professional sport<br>i'm just going to spit ball say though<br>rugby union who<br>you know relies on ticket sales and tv<br>rights and all that sort of jazz<br>if you're looking at your funding<br>dribbling out you know you are dynamic<br>and you are thinking<br>what's happening next year what's<br>happening whereas i think perhaps some<br>of the olympic sports maybe you know who<br>uh<br>more typically rely on government<br>funding perhaps<br>a little more static in their thinking<br>because they have more surety around<br>their funding<br>um if i look at it from an athlete's<br>point of view<br>i think it's been like karen said it's<br>actually been largely proven that<br>i suppose there's always different<br>variants and delta establishing itself<br>more and more but<br>i think except from new zealand and<br>australia sport looks to be carrying on<br>mostly<br>around the world<br>i know the sports bulletin here at night<br>there's very little local content<br>obviously and it's largely<br>uh filled up with international uh<br>sporting which that's always quite<br>ironic how gloating we were probably<br>back<br>when was it when we were having rugby<br>tests at eden park and no one else was<br>empty stadiums and now that's the flip<br>and we're the ones that are<br>all on lock down and yeah even the world<br>seems to be carrying on so obviously<br>everyone's well versed on the reasons<br>i think<br>athletes by nature are pretty dynamic in<br>thinking i mean it's not so i don't see<br>it being a problem i mean<br>ultimately all you can do is evolve and<br>survive or<br>not and die or not die but you know<br>in terms of your career and aspirations<br>i think if you<br>all you can do is operate with the<br>landscape you have in front of you and i<br>think athletes have always done that and<br>will continue to do that and<br>um yeah there's there's no alternative<br>so<br>it's<br>i don't<br>i i think that's basically and that was<br>the way that<br>tokyo was approached you know it was<br>okay what's the current situation what<br>do we need to do to participate what can<br>we what's what's plan a look like what's<br>plan b<br>um what knowledge you know what do we<br>have in front of us what information do<br>we have and yeah essentially that's<br>i guess the mantra and uncertain<br>environment is control the controllables<br>and and if you do that then<br>fate will take care of the rest and you<br>can't be too perturbed on the result<br>because you know you did what you could<br>i think athletes are pretty good at<br>managing that situation because<br>you sort of live an uncertain<br>existence anyway you know selection<br>injury motivation whatever it may be<br>you're<br>you know<br>tomorrow could be your last day so um<br>i think given that you you learn to be<br>pretty dynamic and and uh evolve with<br>the times that's a great yeah the<br>resiliency of athletes<br>kim what about<br>from your lens the um the aspiring<br>olympians um you know what impact do you<br>think tokyo 2020 and the new zealand<br>team results have had on their<br>aspirations<br>yeah i think um<br>i think it can only be positive um and i<br>and i i do i do um just on the on that<br>point hamish was answering there<br>i think the next 12 months are pretty<br>complicated for um<br>some pathways for<br>emerging athletes to have a have<br>certainty um so what we're immediately<br>thinking about at the moment is the<br>beijing the winter olympics are in<br>beijing in february<br>um<br>2022. now at the moment the situation is<br>that no one can get into<br>china unless you do three months three<br>weeks quarantine and at the moment then<br>you don't even know if you sort of even<br>sort of move freely around the<br>setup we're not allowed to go to the<br>venue so you know think about our<br>athletes right now who are going to an<br>olympic games<br>you know and we have some very talented<br>young winter athletes who will be named<br>in a new zealand team this weekend and<br>that's at the moment and they're<br>thinking about miq and about<br>competitions and<br>so it's a bit different and i think what<br>it's meant is people's mindset has to be<br>um<br>adaptable like hamish said so i think<br>we're people are quite challenged some<br>athletes are quite challenged by the<br>uncertainty um<br>and so that's been a trick for them and<br>we've also the commonwealth games are in<br>birmingham in about 10 months time<br>and many of our funded sports so and<br>some that have been to tokyo they've<br>qualified they've got a pathway there<br>but for many sports who who are least<br>funded and or athletes emerging it's<br>very hard to see a competition<br>pathway at the moment because if they<br>leave basically they can't get back and<br>right you know so it's tough so i think<br>it's not an easy thing but i think if we<br>cast out to paris 2024 for the next<br>olympics and beyond there's an amazing<br>runway of olympic cities and olympic<br>opportunities so it goes paris<br>um los angeles 2028 and then amazingly<br>and excitingly brisbane 2032.<br>so there's a good long runway the short<br>runway is murky<br>but what i would say i think it's going<br>to be really interesting in the fullness<br>of time<br>when we debrief finish debrief in tokyo<br>is on the way through and in the um<br>kind of postponed year and be interested<br>in hamish's views on this<br>new zealand had to look into itself to<br>create a it's our own world-class<br>training environment<br>and we had least competition hamish and<br>his crew did an amazing job they went to<br>the last chance regatta to qualify this<br>space for tokyo and then slammed it once<br>they got it but you know that was one of<br>the you were one of the few squads where<br>you hummus that actually left the<br>country<br>and competed on the world stage so most<br>of our athletes<br>went into tokyo without having<br>a long<br>preparation they mainly<br>except for those living and playing<br>overseas and football equestrian golf<br>tennis mainly they've been<br>in new zealand training trying to<br>conduct their business in a winter<br>environment and then going into tokyo so<br>preparing for heat and all of that but<br>the amazing thing about all this is that<br>we had way less<br>demands on our medical team<br>and a global pandemic<br>than we did in the rio olympics and we<br>did in<br>london<br>so the fact that people were masked they<br>came in healthy<br>they trained and prepared they hadn't<br>been traveling around the world and<br>maybe run down or people sick or<br>whatever<br>lead to<br>you know healthier better<br>you know<br>and maybe<br>and maybe this might change some of our<br>plans and preparations and approaches<br>for campaigns<br>in the future i mean you know in the<br>sport like rowing hey miss you would<br>have usually been spending<br>maybe three months a year in europe away<br>from home whatever i mean you know those<br>things may well now change because we<br>know we can do things differently and<br>coaches and you know it's very<br>disruptive for everybody's life the way<br>we've<br>had to be operating in new zealand so<br>i think<br>i think that while there's uncertainty<br>there's also incredible learnings and<br>while there is<br>disruption we<br>needed to innovate and sports innovated<br>and got results and we we need to learn<br>from all of those things i think<br>so not if that even answers the question<br>but that's a great answer and energy<br>you know for for people who<br>are in<br>the business of business rather than the<br>business of sport i think the things<br>that you've both shared are lessons for<br>all of us not not just for sport so i<br>think it's great observation<br>i'm i'm gonna put a final question to<br>each of you now and then i'd love to<br>throw it open to people on the call i<br>see we have a question already in the<br>chat<br>and uh if anyone has a question feel<br>free to put it in the chat or let us<br>know that you'd like to ask the question<br>you're welcome to unmute and also turn<br>your camera on if you like um but let me<br>first kind of lead into that by<br>hamish<br>talking<br>i guess as one of new zealand's revered<br>athletes and i think you know you two<br>are in a goat somewhere in your um on<br>your cv i'm sure<br>but you've performed at the highest<br>level obviously in the olympics um<br>you've you've changed codes and<br>performed at the highest level in the<br>commonwealth games or you've shared<br>codes<br>so how do you stay grounded and focused<br>and and obviously now with a young<br>family and potential to be traveling and<br>living elsewhere next year<br>what kind of what makes you get out of<br>bed in the morning and keep doing the<br>training and the hard work that you<br>obviously have to do to reach the peak<br>performance<br>i think my motivation is has<br>again evolved over time um<br>i used to row because it was something i<br>was good at and<br>um<br>yeah i guess it just was gave me an<br>i don't know i don't know<br>i mean one it's always a<br>snowball you know like we start at one<br>point and you never know where you're<br>going to end up but certainly um<br>this last olympic cycle motivations have<br>been different um perspective has been<br>different<br>obviously with the family<br>the hours and dedication that i could<br>put to training i probably had to be a<br>bit smarter<br>in terms of the way that i worked<br>and<br>i think in terms of staying grounded<br>and focused<br>i think my wife has been quite<br>yeah she's i wouldn't say she cuts me<br>down but you know<br>i think new zealand does that you know<br>like if you get too big for your boots<br>you'll get you'll know about it pretty<br>pretty quick in new zealand um but<br>certainly coming back uh it has been<br>pleasant being out amongst<br>once we've been<br>able to get out in amongst the<br>recognition that i've seen<br>just out of the supermarket<br>around my neighborhood here<br>has been marked<br>even compared to olympics past and i<br>think<br>for me on a personal level that was<br>probably i think part of<br>being successful in the eight i i always<br>knew that that would be different to<br>um<br>the eight is as the blue ribbon event in<br>rowing and it sits differently with the<br>country it's<br>it's more of a country team<br>medal as opposed to an individual medal<br>um and i had the feeling based off<br>we last won that in 1972 as a country<br>and it is still talked about frequently<br>not only in rowing circles but those of<br>the age to remember if you say you're a<br>roller oh i remember you know 72<br>so you know i i just had a sense that it<br>was set differently and it has been a<br>shame that<br>uh<br>with the lockdown back here<br>maybe some of the younger guys haven't<br>had that opportunity to experience that<br>post-olympic glow to its its maximum but<br>with any luck will be that opportunity<br>going forward so<br>um yeah i<br>i<br>i rowing's right like i i i feel as i<br>have pretty good perspective on where<br>sports sits on a global landscape<br>and you know i if you have that and<br>certainly having children adds to that<br>um<br>i i sort of had a bit of a sense of it<br>in the past i guess with eric but more<br>from the<br>shoe being on the other foot and that<br>his focus was not as high<br>towards the rowing as i would have liked<br>has evolved over time<br>and and i have to<br>put in a little plug here i'm i'm<br>thrilled to say that<br>our alumni association so aua<br>we have a wonderful<br>member of our founding advisory board<br>sir mary brennan who in fact<br>we have a rowing scholarship at otago<br>which is uh really honoring sir murray<br>and and uh certainly very well supported<br>by sumeri too financially so i think<br>rowing rowing is here to stay hamish um<br>without a doubt and i see your friend<br>from dunedin on there too glenn<br>yeah<br>we we have to evolve as well as a sport<br>there's obviously a push well i don't<br>know if it's widely known but we're<br>fairly high in terms of participant<br>numbers at the olympics and i know<br>there's a continual push to diversify<br>the sports bring in<br>new sports obviously this year we saw<br>skateboarding and rock climbing and i<br>know it changes again at the next<br>olympics<br>and i think rowing has to really again<br>think on their feet and almost pre in<br>some ways pre-empt that<br>jump to a new model before they're<br>pushed um so i think that's something<br>that needs to be thought about i'm sure<br>it is thought about but<br>um our sports very euro-centric um and<br>uh but i'm sure they're aware of you<br>know the pressure from the olympic<br>committee to perhaps reduce our<br>participant numbers and i have some<br>other ideas around how that could be<br>facilitated but no one's asked me for<br>well thank you and we have the questions<br>i'm pouring on which is awesome i'm<br>going to turn to them in a minute but i<br>have one final question for karen<br>because you know you as you shared with<br>this group you are retreading not<br>retiring um and i'm looking forward<br>personally to what that might bring in<br>the future<br>um but what in the time you've been in<br>nzoc and you've been involved in sport<br>what are the greatest challenges and<br>what were your<br>greatest achievements and i especially<br>want to know what you're going to do<br>with all those air points when you can<br>actually get to fly again<br>well thanks to cinderella i mean it's um<br>yeah i mean gosh it's gone quite quickly<br>and it's sort of put into perspective<br>how much when you talk about competing<br>in in beijing so um didn't quite go go<br>back that far but i started in<br>in 2011 and um<br>you know my my sort of<br>personal vision<br>was that i thought that our olympic team<br>and our commonwealth teams<br>could could stand for a lot more than<br>just sport<br>so i guess one of my greatest challenges<br>has always been about um<br>trying to<br>create a<br>the value proposition i mean i think i'm<br>talking to business people here but i<br>was i was always really determined<br>because we've got a very proud olympic<br>history in new zealand and i know<br>hamish you know has talked about sir<br>murray halberg and others but when we<br>reflect over the years at particular<br>olympics we we typically have had one or<br>two memories but now we were sitting in<br>our olympic<br>profile<br>there's many memories there's so many<br>there's different stories you know you<br>take it out like the eighth story that<br>hamish was part of was it's magical it's<br>so kiwi it's amazing and then you've got<br>the lydia cos then you've got the dane<br>vale adams and then you've got the<br>woman's sevens and what they stood for<br>and the means you know there's so many<br>stories and i think what i<br>have always been motivated and i think<br>it's been a challenge but i think we're<br>we're making progress so how does<br>how does our<br>new zealand olympic team and all it<br>stands for<br>lift<br>brand new zealand how do we create a<br>platform where<br>our athletes can have a voice and<br>they've got character and they they they<br>bring culture and they're different to<br>other parts of the world and<br>showcase us on the world stage as a<br>country that's innovative<br>that's successful but humble<br>and how do we really capture<br>you know that opportunity build<br>connections for new zealand to create<br>influence<br>and also reflecting back into our<br>country to inspire young people and to<br>engage young people<br>and hamish is so right because many<br>young people may not connect with<br>with rowing but they<br>they will with something in the olympic<br>commonwealth program it might now be<br>skateboarding it might be rock climbing<br>it might be sevens it might be netball<br>or bowls or cricket but you know so and<br>i was that's always been a kind of<br>a challenge and i think we're starting<br>to get that<br>that bigger platform so that's one thing<br>the other thing that i think has has<br>been a challenge is um<br>there's a really interesting dilemma and<br>discussion in global sport now around<br>the well-being piece and<br>you know i i think<br>i've i've been lucky enough to be<br>involved<br>in an era where new zealand sport has<br>grown in success as a result of<br>more investment more structure more<br>strategy<br>and probably in that era we've really<br>made advances in technology in sports<br>science and the like and we've probably<br>left some of the human elements behind<br>and we see this in world sport so you<br>know we've had a big discussion here<br>around athlete wellbeing and welfare and<br>as we should and it's been<br>made worse through covert and all of<br>that and that's a global conversation i<br>mean you're seeing it in the states with<br>simone biles and you know it's kind of a<br>global conversation so i think one of<br>our biggest challenges is how is a small<br>country at the bottom of the world with<br>big ambition<br>do we create<br>and sustain a successful sporting<br>um not a system well how do we how do we<br>how do we keep pace<br>and i guess one of my greatest fears was<br>if we went to tokyo<br>we might have been<br>30th on the middle table<br>you know<br>and that wouldn't have been that cool<br>because people say well winning isn't<br>everything but i tell you what it's<br>pretty important<br>i think our challenge and one of my<br>challenges and one of the things is you<br>know like the cost for us of doing<br>business has just got so so heinz and<br>our standards are high so that's a<br>tricky one<br>on the other side just to say the best<br>things for me<br>you know it's privileged i mean i'm a<br>weenie weeny weenie weeny wheel and a<br>bait great on a week winnie colgrave and<br>a great big wheel<br>and<br>it's a privileged opportunity to be<br>you know<br>at a place where people win gold medals<br>or you know where new history's created<br>i mean<br>you know being there at that magical<br>half hour at the rowing you know with<br>with the hamish with the eights with the<br>woman's eights and emma twigg<br>you know winning i mean that is<br>you know it's very very special um and<br>the rawness of the disappointments is<br>also really heartening so i mean it's<br>just a privilege to be part of that um<br>you know it's great that i've been there<br>for all your medals hamish<br>so i might be your little you know i<br>might be your superpower you're the<br>talisman um the other thing i'd just say<br>i'd like to say very briefly and the<br>fact that i'm really<br>really proud of how<br>um as an organization we have worked<br>really hard to<br>to achieve international standing around<br>our<br>our inclusivity and our diversity<br>and<br>and how the new zealand olympic team and<br>our commonwealth games teams<br>represent new zealanders they are<br>inclusive there's a there's faces of all<br>cultures<br>there and men and women um in<br>paralympics now as well doing a great<br>job<br>we know we had some tricky issues around<br>um<br>you know dealing with the first<br>transgender athlete you know openly<br>transgender athlete and laurel hubbard<br>at both the commonwealth games and in<br>tokyo games and<br>and you know i i only say it was tricky<br>because it's first and there's such<br>divided opinions but you know on<br>reflection i'm very satisfied that we<br>did everything we could and so did her<br>teammates to support her<br>and i'm proud that we're at the<br>forefront of that kind of conversation<br>because that's where new zealanders are<br>so if we're not leading we're following<br>and we want to be leaders<br>and um so you know those things make me<br>particularly proud of what we've<br>achieved<br>thank you<br>i'm going to turn to our questions and<br>hamish i'm<br>we've got two here that i'm going to put<br>to you um from dr carol mcarthur who<br>herself was an athlete in the 80s if i'm<br>correct a middle distance runner who<br>trained at the cali um so that in itself<br>i think is<br>a sign of resiliency<br>but her question is um what was it like<br>training training in dunedin and um she<br>asked that because of her own<br>experiences with the wind at the<br>caledonian but for you what was it like<br>and then my second question which is i'm<br>going to tag on to that is from glenn<br>sinclair who wants to know if it's true<br>that you gave the man's pair an<br>ultimatum to join the eights<br>so both questions over to you hamish<br>so yeah training in dunedin um i<br>i'll be honest the vast majority of my<br>high level training has been<br>uh at lake karapiro or international um<br>so i came through school based in<br>dunedin and then probably<br>two summers i would say i was based at<br>uh in dunedin and winter is based at<br>lake carapiro uh so certainly yeah we're<br>we're a bit like wellington i suppose<br>you can't be the otago harbor on a good<br>day<br>but<br>they they're not a few and far between<br>um<br>yeah so it certainly gives you the<br>ability to to row in all conditions um<br>we actually did as a school quite a bit<br>of training on the<br>on the hindu river which is a tribute<br>cherry to the atari river out by the<br>airport um which is typically a lot a<br>lot um flatter and more consistent<br>conditions um but yeah training on the<br>harbour and in dunedin i i'll be honest<br>i don't think i did<br>like a full<br>dunedin winter rowing i think by the<br>time i was training all year round<br>i'd managed to make new zealand teams<br>that were training in the north island<br>so<br>that was typically where i spent my<br>winter so i i think i escaped the worst<br>of it but i do remember<br>you know trying to get down<br>uh appropriately called<br>the slip into the harbour like the the<br>launching ramp and yeah if there's ice<br>on there as well as green slime i see<br>green slime that's not a good combo so<br>uh i had a fair few uh<br>grazers on my ass from stopping over<br>trying to get the boat in the water<br>oh second part of the question oh yeah<br>glenn um<br>uh<br>yeah like uh<br>i said to the peer<br>when i first came back so<br>for those who don't know obviously i<br>used to row the pierre boat with eric<br>and then um<br>athletes have been in that boat since<br>rio and done fairly well um i think in<br>terms of results they got third fourth<br>and second and 2017 18 and 19.<br>uh typically the pierre has been the<br>first selected boat so some of the<br>strongest athletes go and best athletes<br>go in that boat um<br>when i first came back i<br>said oh look you know if you guys want<br>to go and hey that'd be great but these<br>the guys who were incumbents in that<br>boat at the time<br>uh were meadowless internationally so<br>wide jump from an opportunity like that<br>to go in an unproven boat<br>uh<br>and<br>i said yeah they were they obviously<br>queried me as to whether i had ambition<br>to go back into the pier<br>the reality was that i didn't um have<br>any harbor any great ambition and i<br>certainly said to them look as long as<br>you're performing and looking like<br>you're sort of winning medals i<br>certainly<br>won't<br>and get in the way of that uh but<br>yeah just the situation rose towards the<br>end of last year where<br>the incumbents were really struggling as<br>a combination<br>and it gave me the opportunity to get my<br>sticky in there and<br>i sort of proved that i was still the<br>top um<br>rower on<br>uh<br>top sweeps or stroke side rower which is<br>the side of the boat that i row on and<br>we sort of ended up in somewhat of it<br>there was obviously potential for the<br>eight but we ended up in some sort of uh<br>dayton really where uh either<br>you join me<br>in the eight or i race you for your spot<br>and you miss losing that so<br>you know<br>you pick you pick your poison so<br>uh like it wasn't overly overt but yeah<br>there was a little bit of<br>yeah it all worked out so you know<br>yeah<br>and that that leads me to a question we<br>have here um<br>from a caller from invercargill who has<br>a question for both hamish and karen and<br>he he asked in the past success by an<br>athlete sometimes seems to be through<br>them qualifying for the olympics has<br>this changed and is going for gold now<br>more of an expectation of success<br>measure of success<br>well i think that's from tim ward who's<br>wishing his sister a happy birthday for<br>yesterday so i should just pass that on<br>there jacinda<br>um<br>yeah thanks tim um look it's really<br>interesting and actually quite a<br>complicated thing sometimes the whole<br>pathway<br>to um get to an olympic team<br>and um<br>there's sort of two pieces to it one is<br>through the the sports pathway and the<br>other is then to meet the standard set<br>by the new zealand olympic committee and<br>the sort of various gates<br>you have to step through<br>um<br>and it's fair to say in the<br>i think it's probably the 90s i i don't<br>recall specifically the era but<br>there was a lot of consternation around<br>new zealand in conversation about the<br>fact that we probably weren't performing<br>at a level of expectation at olympic<br>games and<br>that was a number of reasons and i don't<br>really think there was a satisfactory<br>system or funding or pathway to support<br>that but notwithstanding all of that in<br>that era in probably early 2000s<br>there was a standard set by the new<br>zealand olympic committee<br>to have a selection standard to say that<br>we wanted to make sure that when<br>athletes were at the olympic games<br>winter or summer they were going to be<br>credible performers<br>and they were going to be um you know<br>it's worthy of being in the olympic team<br>so at that time and subsequently it has<br>has remained so<br>you athletes have to demonstrate all<br>teams that they can finish in the top 16<br>of the field at the olympics so that's<br>the new zealand olympic committee kind<br>of that's the finish line for selection<br>what actually happens in practice as an<br>athlete and i'll use a rower because<br>it's probably topical and homeless can<br>tell me if i'm incorrect so you start<br>off in at world champs and you typically<br>have to qualify<br>by performing at a world event<br>in your sport and if you are in some<br>sport you qualify by name<br>so it might be hamish bond and eric<br>murray qualify a seat and you or they<br>qualify their boat neither named people<br>to sit in that boat and go to the<br>olympics<br>or sometimes it's by country<br>and this is a really cruel situation<br>because people qualify a spot and it's<br>not a personal spot and it varies across<br>sports so in a sport like athletics<br>tom walsh they had had a qualification<br>for an event by name because he had a<br>particular result and they had a certain<br>number of high people by name and then<br>there's other spots available<br>so get by name by by individual and then<br>it comes through and then the sport<br>might say and sometimes sports i.e<br>cycling rowing sailing etc have very<br>high standards so they don't nominate<br>athletes unless they are going to be<br>sometimes middle capable<br>way higher than top 16.<br>and so it has to be a situation where<br>they then decide okay we've got a spot<br>for<br>the men's pier or the olympics<br>who are we going to name to sit in those<br>two seats<br>who are those two people<br>so they then nominate people to the new<br>zealand olympic committee and if they<br>didn't clearly demonstrate top 16 they<br>go through if not that's a tricky<br>conversation<br>with the fullness of time things have<br>changed so in that era where the top 16<br>was brought in<br>you know we weren't having particularly<br>high and deep results<br>if we reflect on the most recent<br>olympics we had middle results in<br>uh 11 sports<br>and you know more medals so clearly that<br>issue now is different<br>and it is therefore timely for us to say<br>what is what is acceptable now in terms<br>of our standard<br>however and somewhat it's sort of a<br>material because it's all the other<br>gateways to get through so i guess what<br>i'm asking answering your question<br>thomas to say that<br>sometimes it depends which sport<br>whether the athlete qualifies by name or<br>not and usually in sports like cycling<br>and rowing and yachting etc they usually<br>don't<br>it's usually new zealand's<br>quota and then people have to<br>demonstrate form<br>and then the sports also decide because<br>they want to make sure that they<br>immediately their crews their athletes<br>also get metal results so they get<br>funding<br>so there's all sorts of things that come<br>to play in this and after each olympics<br>we review that<br>i think it's particularly hard if i<br>reflect on tokyo where we might have had<br>a<br>athlete in the sport like badminton for<br>example that qualified one spot and they<br>haven't had a badminton athlete at the<br>olympics since 2008<br>and that athlete wasn't able to<br>demonstrate that they were going to be<br>in the top 16 so therefore weren't<br>selected<br>so at the moment we have quite a lot of<br>conversation in our debrief about<br>in today in 2021<br>what should this process that is<br>relatively complicated how should it<br>come together<br>and so to answer your question about is<br>it all about going for gold from our<br>point of view no<br>in fact the new zealand olympic<br>committee doesn't have middle targets<br>we are there to support all athletes<br>do the best that they can in their<br>personal performance you know to create<br>the right environment and support for<br>them to perform at the best of their<br>ability<br>so<br>that certainly helps<br>but um that's not our driver our driver<br>is around credible high performance<br>global stage<br>spotlight opportunities so now we're<br>reviewing that and saying what is what<br>should that look like for the future<br>so sorry if i've confused you through<br>that answer but<br>but you don't clap the bridesmaid at a<br>wedding right<br>i guess there is a there is a<br>performance target one way or another<br>yeah absolutely and there's the<br>expectation i mean we're pretty tough i<br>mean<br>new zealanders are relatively<br>you know pretty tough on on on standards<br>and performances<br>well i think um i know we're at time<br>this has been a wonderful conversation<br>thank you both hamish and karen<br>uh we both appreciate your time<br>and and giving us insight into what goes<br>on to to get to the level you perform at<br>or you support the performance of<br>i think it's been such an exciting time<br>for new zealand congratulations on<br>behalf of the team that's on this call<br>um for all that you do and and also i<br>think thank you for for being um<br>so human so down to earth with your<br>your own sort of<br>points that you made to the group i<br>think it's really heartwarming to know<br>that you are very normal people you do<br>normal things um but you are resilient<br>and you're always looking for a better<br>way so we really appreciate your time we<br>know you're an inspiration hamish in<br>particular inspiration to young people<br>coming through i believe we have one of<br>our our own um recipients of the samari<br>brennan rowing scholarship on the call<br>so maybe one day she'll be in a boat in<br>the olympics too<br>but we'd like to thank you so much and i<br>think i hand over to danella from<br>the department of alumni relations to<br>wrap up the session thank you<br>good okay thank you jacinta and thank<br>you so much to karen and hamish for um<br>giving us your time<br>and i'm just<br>seeing the italico spirit in both of you<br>that humble view that you have of the<br>world was really heartening for all of<br>us to hear and have that honest<br>reflection on your experiences so thank<br>you so much<br>hamish i know you've only done two<br>semesters at otago but we came with one<br>of ours<br>hopefully that's okay and
