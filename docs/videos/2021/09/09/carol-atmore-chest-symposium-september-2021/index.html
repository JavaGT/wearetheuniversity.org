where we<br>are at<br>with the health system reforms and<br>particularly how they apply in the<br>primary care space and i'm going to so<br>i'm just going to talk about the reforms<br>in general<br>more from a primary health care<br>perspective and then about my thoughts<br>on how that applies locally and then<br>some few final comments uh at a national<br>level again and then um some time for<br>questions and comments<br>so it's a great pleasure and a privilege<br>to speak after david<br>so we first met on the west coast when i<br>was a junior health surgeon and he uh<br>was a service manager there and then<br>again on a study tour led by chris hamm<br>in the mid<br>and um you'll see from this photo that<br>um well i'll leave it to you to decide<br>who's winning the greying hair race<br>between david and i but i'd have to say<br>david is probably the best boss i've<br>ever had and much of what i've learned<br>about clinical leadership i've done that<br>from and with him so it's a as i say<br>it's a real privilege to speak up to you<br>david<br>um so<br>i think this might be a way of summing<br>up<br>a lot of what david has has said so i<br>bought two books of poetry in my life<br>and my twenties when i was<br>testing that side of myself out and one<br>of them was by steve turner and history<br>repeats itself has to no one listens<br>so um i'm just kind of putting it out<br>there in our mind as i go through<br>so the big reveal in april 2021<br>about what was going to happen with the<br>health system<br>reform<br>so you know a change in structure as<br>david's<br>outlined<br>and<br>there were three um<br>and the commissioning and provision of<br>health services<br>in that hospital and specialist care and<br>primary and community care<br>had a different approach to how they<br>would be commissioned<br>so<br>for me<br>the<br>three things about this that got me<br>really excited actually as part of the<br>reason uh now why i'm um<br>moved out of the university back into um<br>health services clinical leadership<br>roles so i want to cover those three<br>things off next<br>so um<br>have you ever seen uh a minister of the<br>crown talk about a policy uh direction<br>on on video in um maori and in english<br>and you can choose which which of those<br>you want to um look at<br>so i think the maori health authority is<br>potent has the potential to be a real<br>game changer in<br>new zealand in terms of um<br>the focus on equity that we've been<br>talking about for a long time<br>actually doing some<br>some real tangible um opportunity to<br>make that better so i thought that was<br>pretty um pretty cool<br>the second thing despite david's<br>um<br>and i do understand where you're coming<br>from and i agree with you about<br>disconnecting um commissioning and<br>provision has got risks i think<br>from a general practice perspective over<br>the years<br>the problem is that um the hospital<br>always gets the the lion's share of the<br>dosh and primary care and community care<br>ends up uh having the what's left over<br>uh and so um the potential in the the<br>reforms is that the split between the<br>pot of money that funds primary and<br>community care and the pot of money that<br>funds hospital care is clearly<br>delineated further up the um further up<br>closer to the center and there are<br>absolutely<br>concerns that that brings but it does<br>also bring an opportunity for um more<br>funding to be available for care and<br>primary and community care and i know<br>that<br>there are there are<br>pros and cons of that but that was<br>something that got me quite um excited<br>about what the reforms may be able to<br>offer<br>and then the third thing that got me<br>excited was a clear focus on locality<br>networks<br>and care which is the care closer to<br>home<br>um<br>concept which is what um i think we were<br>really building on the west coast um<br>over the time um when david and i were<br>were working in that space was about<br>connected we were you know in essence we<br>were doing<br>developing working towards putting a<br>locality network<br>approach on the coast as was in the<br>canterbury space as well<br>so um there are these four anchoring<br>points to the locality network so the<br>first is around<br>the widest ocean economic determinants<br>of health for example housing employment<br>and looking at inequalities and wealth<br>and power<br>the second is around that excuse me the<br>health behaviors and lifestyles aspect<br>that's outlined there for example<br>smoking activity nutrition drinking<br>gambling<br>the third is around<br>adapting<br>for example the natural and built<br>environment as well as having an<br>integrated health and social care system<br>and again it's not just a health system<br>but it's a health and social care system<br>um which goes further out in to people's<br>lives than just a health system does<br>so those are the things that made me um<br>hopeful that there is potential in this<br>round of reforms to actually have<br>something that better meets the needs of<br>so um thinking about locality networks<br>in terms of what we know<br>so<br>there to be the locality plans are to be<br>developed locally by communities and ewe<br>maori partnership boards<br>so<br>every locality will have a consistent<br>range of core services<br>which<br>is outlined back in the health and<br>disability system review documents which<br>is a list of 20 plus things<br>that need to be in place and it's all<br>you know makes very good sense and that<br>health new zealand and the maori health<br>authority will jointly commission the<br>services<br>against the locality plans that are<br>developed<br>but there are um you know the unknowns<br>is in this is so what will the<br>governance and leadership structure look<br>like of a locality network<br>how will it be pulled together<br>and<br>you know who will have different roles<br>will it be<br>health providers will it be<br>local<br>territorial local authority<br>representatives will it be<br>community based would it be elected will<br>it be appointed<br>what's the connection with<br>the ewe maori partnership boards and<br>true partnership to make those work and<br>then who will be accountable so if<br>things don't work out who holds the<br>accountability<br>uh<br>and then how will the relationship<br>between the communities and the eb maori<br>partnerships boards actually work in<br>reality and and how much local autonomy<br>will there be i recall<br>with the locality plans when i was um<br>an elite board member on this coast<br>district health board in the early 2000s<br>one of the issues for us and we were<br>essentially at locality we were 30<br>something thousand people um but so much<br>came down from central government uh of<br>what we had to do that there was<br>actually very little space for what we<br>wanted to do<br>because of the you know the funding<br>constraints<br>and<br>then<br>this is a slide from martin heffer's<br>presentation to the gpc me conference<br>north and russia in june of this year<br>and this is sort of<br>another layer of the thinking<br>around what an operating model for<br>primary and community care might look<br>like<br>in these locality networks<br>so they're talking about having an<br>enhanced core primary care team<br>so that is<br>what we might call general practice plus<br>so our current um<br>approach to providing primary health<br>care<br>of late we you know there's been<br>particularly in the mental health space<br>the health improvement practitioners and<br>health coaches and<br>navigators roles uh kyophina roles<br>coming in to the<br>core primary care team so<br>it's about you know<br>thinking who are the next lot of people<br>to become part of the enhanced<br>core primary care team<br>and then having<br>locality provider networks which is<br>those enhanced poor primary care teams<br>starting to<br>reach out to the services um in the<br>community that they should maybe be<br>having you know a close connection with<br>for example age residential care<br>district nursing oral health primary<br>birthing units maternity<br>care<br>and then how all of those things link<br>together under provider management<br>network management so coordinating<br>enabling i'm looking at governance<br>quality improvement workforce planning<br>and then that and group interfaces<br>through the locality network with the um<br>health nz locality commissioning team<br>so<br>these all look really good on paper<br>makes sense at a level um but<br>again<br>it's this question of how do we make<br>that work<br>in reality<br>so<br>for example<br>we know<br>that the current funding model and<br>primary<br>care isn't really working um<br>and i know that that's talking about<br>funding but it's a reality<br>um we have provider network management<br>like organizations currently they're<br>called phos<br>they're not mandatory in the new<br>environment and uh what will be<br>the um you know what will be their<br>role in the future<br>um kappa maori services have always got<br>the smallest slice of the smaller pie so<br>if we say primary care get the smaller<br>slice of a pie the couple of maori<br>services get the smaller slice of that<br>pie as well and in mental health<br>services with our recent review down<br>here that was clear as well<br>and<br>enhanced primary care teams are the<br>directions so general practice<br>you know<br>critique of this by some people is that<br>you know counting how many times the<br>term general practice is mentioned in<br>the doc from the new documents and you<br>know it's it's a small number<br>so<br>you know so what will a new funding<br>model look like<br>and and what what will the new provider<br>network management look like<br>will phos morph as they did from the<br>independent practitioner association<br>days to become primary health<br>organizations or will will they now<br>morph to become<br>provider network management<br>organizations or will another<br>group of organizations um<br>develop that take that role will it be a<br>pluris for realistic future where you<br>know<br>sort of courses for courses um<br>will the locality networks be<br>geographical<br>communities of interest particularly in<br>the maori and pacific provider<br>space or meeting the needs of um you<br>know maori by maori foreign<br>for pacific across<br>the country<br>and um so how and how will that<br>interaction between um the<br>maori health authority the elite<br>governance partnership groups and the<br>co-papi providers how will all of that<br>work and how will that interface with<br>mainstream services<br>and lastly how will general practice of<br>today adapt for the enhanced primary<br>care teams of tomorrow so i think these<br>are some of the things that you know<br>taxing the minds of us that are trying<br>so in terms of locality networks<br>implementation um so uh there are five<br>key areas that<br>the department of um prime minister and<br>cabinet transition unit led by um<br>steve mckernan with deputy martin<br>heffert who many of you will know um was<br>the chief executive of compass to order<br>uh pho in the wellington region for many<br>years um so that there are five<br>key priority areas<br>that the locality networks are<br>encouraged to focus on so one is whanau<br>with complex health and social needs the<br>first two thousand days so we were all<br>for several years going um working on<br>the first thousand days of just instant<br>inflationary age that's just been<br>doubled<br>and then<br>distress and mental illness<br>uh people with complex long-term<br>conditions<br>and the last years of life<br>so uh the um<br>the the messaging is that there's a<br>we all need to be focusing on all of<br>these eventually but it's quite a lot to<br>pick off in one bite so encouraging um<br>locality networks to focus themselves<br>around<br>one of these areas to<br>to get some runs on the board to work<br>out how to work together uh and then<br>expand can we try having a break from<br>so um<br>and the money that's been<br>put in in budget<br>this year was 46 million dollars rounded<br>up over four years to develop a locality<br>approach it's being described now sort<br>of the terminology has gone from<br>locality networks to their locality<br>approach<br>and there's 9.6 million dollars for this<br>year to establish five to six prototypes<br>that are aimed to cover about five<br>percent of new zealand<br>so um<br>the there's obviously a time<br>this isn't going to happen overnight<br>which isn't good to know it's going to<br>take more than four years though to get<br>all this these changes embedded<br>and this is um<br>back to what david alluded to the short<br>term political cycle drives some of this<br>and that that can be a problem for the<br>real work that needs to be done<br>so what we know is so the transition<br>unit has gathered information um<br>there was a call out to all all dhbs and<br>here it goes another interested people<br>providers over the last month or so it<br>is probably three or four weeks ago just<br>prior to cover that<br>all those 300 documents from across the<br>country have the transition units um<br>um inbox and they're being looked at to<br>sort of get a sense of what kind of<br>integration projects um in this location<br>network space are happening around the<br>country<br>and<br>that<br>particularly um when there's a strong<br>focus on<br>partnership with maori as being a key um<br>a key thing that that they're wanting to<br>have information regarding<br>and then<br>when the motor health authority and<br>health nz interim boards are appointed<br>in september<br>if it goes according to plan<br>that they will be briefed on the summary<br>of that information and then there'll be<br>a process over the following three<br>months<br>to select these locality network<br>prototypes<br>um and i'm wondering if prototype avoids<br>the pilot um<br>the pilot issue that david was talking<br>about that might be interesting to talk<br>about um in the group discussion<br>um<br>and uh<br>then the first though so there's going<br>to be five or six and they'll go live<br>early next year<br>and<br>so<br>what's not clear is who will be the<br>chosen few um i suspect it will be<br>um<br>groups of people who have strong<br>connections with the<br>maori<br>ewe partnership boards with maori<br>providers we actually have they've done<br>a lot of hard work already and are ready<br>to go with um with work that meets um<br>focuses on improving equity for or<br>achieving equity for maori<br>and<br>as well linked into the community<br>and what will the other areas that don't<br>so<br>what's my take on what this means for<br>the southern health system<br>and these are very much my personal<br>views um so um<br>yeah<br>just<br>my reflections<br>so i want to um look back to<br>those of us that were at the last<br>symposium or colloquium that chest<br>held<br>in back in april i think<br>and we reported on the uh midpoint<br>progress of the evaluation of the<br>primary and community care strategy<br>implementation<br>um in in the southern region so that was<br>funded by health research south um<br>to do a three-year implementation<br>foundation sorry i've just seems to have<br>sort of dark it's probably the sun it's<br>so sunny here in geneva<br>um<br>okay um and um<br>so you'll recall that those were there<br>that we presented different streams of<br>that work and um<br>we uh<br>are still near as<br>life's got a bit busy since then uh and<br>the feedback on that um we're at the<br>point of<br>as we said we would at the time sending<br>that out but i'm giving you a preview of<br>it now so i do apologize for the time<br>delay in this process<br>so at that midpoint evaluation the the<br>key<br>findings that were coming through is<br>the way that strategy was being<br>evaluated implemented across the region<br>that we needed a greater focus on equity<br>and that<br>noting that change takes time and that<br>um a thought that it just takes time so<br>again a three-year horizon for<br>you know bringing a a more integrated<br>way of<br>providing health services in our region<br>um<br>is probably three years is gonna we're<br>gonna be<br>part way through we will have got some<br>good things in place but the whole<br>strategy won't be implementable in a<br>three-year horizon<br>taking a a staged approach<br>as opposed to leaping the chasm approach<br>and<br>that changes that improved teamwork<br>for example clinical pharmacists the<br>health improvement practitioners health<br>coaches community support workers and<br>that improved integration between<br>primary community and hospital care with<br>the valued things that were coming<br>through<br>and that a clarity of purpose and scope<br>of the various projects was important so<br>where that was clear the projects were<br>making good progress where that was<br>unclear that was causing stumbling<br>delay<br>and then those present at the colloquium<br>at the end in the discussion<br>we agreed that that we should build a<br>research and evaluation capacity within<br>the southern health system uh and that<br>we should be uh linking that with our<br>academic partners<br>southern institute of technology that we<br>should pursue that in a kind of a co-op<br>tier of the south kind of concept not<br>the in in slavish detail but the idea of<br>that had merit and that<br>we that translating research and<br>evaluation into practice would be key we<br>thought that this could be built around<br>health research south but then it would<br>need<br>an expanded role for health research<br>south to become more than locality<br>assessments and funding<br>and be broader than just southern dhb<br>and the dunedin school of medicine and<br>then you know to include the whole<br>southern health system and academic<br>institutions more broadly in our region<br>so i just wanted to just to remind<br>ourselves of that<br>and then<br>talk about<br>possible locality networks that have<br>been put up<br>and this is only to say that there are a<br>range of different ways you can cut the<br>cake<br>so there's nothing here that that is<br>anything except saying how else can how<br>can we<br>um<br>look at the southern region so you can<br>look at it by existing dhb boundaries<br>you could look at it by council<br>territorial local authority boundaries<br>you could look at it by electorate<br>boundaries you could look at it by<br>roonaka boundaries<br>and you can look at it by<br>what the southern strategic plan put in<br>places boundaries<br>so um<br>what you know what are<br>what is it likely to look like down here<br>so what we know is that<br>the locality networks are suggested to<br>be<br>between 20 000 and 100 000 and the<br>initial<br>information that was coming out from the<br>transition unit<br>that ewe maori partnership boards will<br>be key partners in locality network<br>discussions<br>and that naitahu are considering<br>currently<br>how they want to engage with<br>with the health system um in developing<br>locality networks so for us down here in<br>southern<br>we are actually at the stage of<br>having those um preliminary discussions<br>with the iwo maori partnership board<br>which is our ewe governance committee at<br>this stage in the piece to say how are<br>we going to work together to implement<br>locality networks in our roohee<br>so what's not clear is how decisions<br>about the locality network boundaries<br>will be made locally<br>will we be allowed to have smaller<br>and larger<br>locality networks that's the decision<br>for example<br>hakanui gore<br>is a as a as a<br>as a locality network in many many<br>states it has<br>highway<br>has done a lot of work around<br>integration um both health with social<br>services and with the community but they<br>probably don't make the 20 000 mark and<br>dunedin is uh more than a hundred<br>thousand into it's sort of split and<br>even into two seems um a bit surprising<br>so<br>how's that going to work and<br>looking at our rurality it may be that<br>a locality network<br>for one conversation um<br>is a certain size and then when you<br>start thinking about sort of how way the<br>hospital<br>network with our rural hospitals and our<br>urban hospitals overlies that<br>that we needed different lens for our<br>network so maybe we have<br>sub networks and supra networks i don't<br>know how that um will pan out but i<br>think we need to not be<br>constrained by um<br>you know<br>you can only have one view of a network<br>because of our context is different than<br>it would be in central auckland for<br>example<br>so what might be a<br>approach<br>for us um down in southern<br>so i think the realities about being a<br>prototype this is my personal view um is<br>that um<br>i i am<br>i i think that it's you know<br>everyone will be putting their hand up<br>to be a prototype when that call comes<br>but i won't be holding my breath<br>for us to be chosen and putting all my<br>eggs in that basket<br>i think it's really important that<br>rather than try and be first cab off the<br>rank that we focus on developing our iwi<br>maori relationships across our orgy so i<br>think<br>and you know it that's um<br>that in some areas that's strong and in<br>other areas um that's less strong and i<br>think that's where we should be<br>focusing our energy because for the long<br>term that<br>is going to be what will<br>meet the needs of our community is in an<br>equitable way<br>and i think we need to focus on<br>developing the building blocks so that<br>is something that<br>so there's work that happens at the<br>locality network level um which is sort<br>of capital l capital n um who you know<br>setting up the<br>structure and the governance and the<br>leadership of the locality networks<br>um and bringing in um you know the um<br>the other government departmental<br>agencies um the<br>stronger public health focus<br>integrating hospital social<br>primary care services for the whole<br>region but<br>you know each general practice can work<br>on it's<br>it's knitting so to speak<br>and start to develop up these building<br>blocks<br>and then thinking about what our<br>locality provider networks and provider<br>management network structure<br>would be<br>across the region as well<br>so you know from a general practice<br>perspective um i think the questions are<br>and this is the stuff we can do now and<br>in our practices with our teams and and<br>well south we can be leading these<br>conversations<br>is<br>you know how if we were going to add<br>additional roles to the team that we<br>have in our practice at the moment what<br>would they be and then what would order<br>how would we approach that when we first<br>add so<br>as was the case on the west coast when<br>we had an integrated<br>primary mental health service<br>more than a dozen years ago that was the<br>single best thing that the pho there<br>ever did for general practice was making<br>mental health provision and primary care<br>much easier and and we are now having<br>the hips and health coaches and<br>community social workers coming into our<br>region um which is fantastic<br>and so the challenge is um how do we<br>enable that into our small practices<br>which don't have the magic 10 000<br>population and there's been a couple of<br>examples of sharing in that space and we<br>need to develop that more<br>what's the role for clinical pharmacists<br>and how can they become a stronger part<br>of the team<br>um<br>roles<br>and then how can we develop more<br>partnership with our kappa<br>so<br>can all of our practices you know<br>uh look at at their interface with<br>kaplani providers in their area and<br>strengthen that and actually you know<br>develop them as part of their broader<br>team or<br>not their team their team um<br>what training and new skills do the gp<br>team and i would hazard this means the<br>gps who are maybe a little stuck in<br>their ways what what training and new<br>skills do does the gp team need to be<br>able to work in this different way<br>expanded transdisciplinary transectoral<br>teams<br>there are other questions that about i.t<br>enablement but i i agree<br>with david that actually it's about the<br>people um and you can the i.t enablement<br>will will follow in various ways but i<br>think it's about how we work together<br>how we develop a culture of one team<br>across the broader system in primary<br>care the community and reaching more<br>into<br>our connections with our hospital<br>colleagues and as well because that's<br>when we'll really start to develop a um<br>a whole of system so the you know the<br>whole of the system for the southern<br>health system and each locality having a<br>whole system approach to how um care is<br>provided to meet the needs of the of the<br>so i just want to finally swing back to<br>the national view and just make a couple<br>of closing comments or observations in<br>that<br>in that space<br>so<br>some recent comments have been made<br>about money um lately and thanks to tim<br>stokes for pointing this twitter comment<br>from ian powell<br>hot off the press i think that might<br>have been today or yesterday maybe it<br>was yes today and i thought yesterday<br>was today um<br>it was a busy day yesterday um so ian<br>powell so many of us will know him as<br>asms<br>i don't know if he was chief executive<br>for what his title was but the leader of<br>the probably the most powerful<br>union in the country i think<br>the hospital doctors union um<br>which some general practitioners for<br>example those of us working on the west<br>coast of the dhb were also members of<br>so removing patient co-payments can be<br>justified when considered through the<br>lens of a universal public health system<br>the structure of privately owned general<br>practices is the means of delivering<br>most primary care should not be used as<br>an argument and opposition<br>general practice has to fit in with this<br>so that's uh<br>i'm<br>find that an a a really interesting<br>comment from ian um<br>um<br>yeah that's very interesting again i'd<br>be interested in david's um reflection<br>on that having worked with him for many<br>years and<br>um his asms<br>role<br>and then um last week martin hefford um<br>spoke to the<br>gpcme south virtual conference uh and<br>there was um and this is this was quoted<br>a new zealand doctor<br>so pay parity between employed gps and<br>senior public hospital doctors quote has<br>to be one of the considerations in<br>dealing with the gp shortage<br>quote i think if we are going to be<br>serious about refocusing the health<br>system on primary and community care<br>then we need to have parity in terms and<br>conditions for the workforce<br>and he then went on to also say the same<br>applied for<br>for primary care nursing and<br>hospital-based nursing so<br>raising that<br>to that aspect which i think is<br>um<br>the elephant in the room<br>and the last comment that i'd like to<br>make uh is about change in the time of<br>covert so<br>the thai and david alluded to this as<br>well um timelines for the reform are<br>really tight<br>uh and um<br>303 days time um that southern dhb will<br>no longer exist<br>and certainly for my<br>work life in the last 10 days has been<br>completely focused on delta<br>and we don't know what's going to happen<br>with that<br>we don't have delta in the south island<br>and yet i've<br>you know spent many hours every day<br>um over the last about two weeks nearly<br>now<br>so um<br>you know have have we got<br>as a health system have we got the<br>headspace to push on with these reforms<br>how concrete are the timelines i mean i<br>totally understand the political<br>imperative behind the timing of these<br>reforms um but<br>it's you know<br>i i am<br>um just<br>a little um concerned about whether we<br>will have the capacity as a system to<br>really embrace this and end up with the<br>best solution<br>for altera in new zealand in the<br>circumstances<br>so lastly<br>i just want to um swing back to<br>samuel gray who is<br>someone that i've hold enormous<br>respect for and and kind of follow what<br>he says and does through his career um<br>he's the the man that started who said<br>about screening programs all screening<br>programs do harm some do<br>more harm than good and some do more<br>harm than good at a reasonable cost so<br>he is a pragmatic man<br>and his comment that i've always really<br>i usually have this up on the wall in my<br>office<br>if you don't imagine plan and build the<br>future someone else will<br>so despite all the challenges uh that<br>are facing us and the unknowns there's<br>also an enormous opportunity um i think<br>if we can can take on board the approach<br>and comments that david was alluding to<br>about one integrated um healthcare<br>system that we're trying to build um<br>together<br>then um i think there is a real<br>potential for better health outcomes in<br>ltro and new zealand going forward<br>so<br>that's all i wanted to say thank you<br>for<br>thank you for listening and i'm really<br>happy to take questions and comments at<br>well carol thank you very very much um<br>just coming back to the point you made<br>earlier about uh having<br>uh worked with david many years ago he's<br>mentored you well it was a terrific<br>presentation so thank you very very much<br>and a lot of very useful information in<br>there and<br>insights into the current state of play<br>from the perspective of us of a pho<br>which is um<br>buried in the process of responding to<br>the various expectations<br>um<br>so we will open it up for questions<br>coming from the chat<br>room um<br>so please if you have uh questions put<br>them into the chat room<br>um i i will uh just start out by<br>um asking about the funding question um<br>so that is the in many ways the nexus of<br>the elephant in the room<br>um i'm really interested in uh whether<br>you're able to share with with us the<br>thoughts perhaps coming through the pho<br>but also your own<br>uh independently around how<br>what what's your thinking in terms of<br>how funding<br>needs to be configured in order to<br>support<br>the<br>direction of movement with the reforms<br>and the sorts of changes needed within<br>primary care you know right out through<br>to how you've explained the need to be<br>able to expand the gp team and broaden<br>the horizons of general practice<br>um you know shift services and scope of<br>practice and so on and so on and so<br>forth take away the patient fees<br>you get the pay parity<br>so there's a heck of a lot packed in<br>there so i'm just interested in your<br>reflections on the funding question<br>it's complex um that would be the first<br>whether or not<br>general practice is free at point of<br>care or affordable that point of care<br>for everybody<br>that you know there are different views<br>on that um but it<br>regard but it absolutely has to be<br>affordable uh at point of care for<br>everybody i think um it's it's crazy<br>that in our system<br>you get sick<br>and you<br>turn left and have to pay or wait until<br>you're so sick that you can turn right<br>and get it for free by going to hospital<br>so<br>that's a fundamental<br>inequity as i see it<br>and um<br>the the<br>paying for widgets approach<br>is is another barrier for good care<br>so<br>as david alluded to in the hospital<br>context if you're paid for<br>what you produce rather than what your<br>outcomes are it that makes you do<br>strange things and the same happens in<br>the primary care context so<br>we are going through a um you know a<br>interregnum i suppose we're uh an in<br>between where<br>hospital services are saying okay we<br>need to<br>have more services provided in the<br>community and and<br>and either that's being asked to be done<br>for nothing with no extra support or<br>again a fee for service kind of approach<br>so i think we need to to design a<br>different model which<br>says okay here primary enhanced primary<br>care team working with your hospital<br>colleagues and other parts of the system<br>you know we want purchasing outcomes<br>rather than purchasing fee for service<br>widgets<br>that i don't have an answer for it but<br>um certainly<br>if we can<br>model how that would look and<br>incentivize<br>primary care to<br>have greater focus on health promotion<br>um<br>you know keeping people well<br>um<br>people with long-term conditions keeping<br>the for<br>supporting them to um<br>to look after their health conditions<br>well with support from the community<br>from kaifena from um patient-led peer<br>groups all of those things then<br>we should have i think<br>a better opportunity better chance of<br>having better outcomes<br>think thanks carol and i'm going to<br>stitch together about three comments<br>that have come in um from ray anton uh<br>from david hill uh and karen not certain<br>what the last name is uh and these are<br>around the the the the separation<br>between general practice and hospital<br>services or primary care and hospital<br>that seems to<br>be uh in some ways reinforced<br>through the arrangement arrangements<br>currently<br>in implementation through health nsaid<br>so what if you just reflect on<br>on that question<br>and how you see it from your perspective<br>so is that sort of<br>as opposed to it being decided locally<br>in the current system actually the<br>separation happening further up the tree<br>is that is that the kind of well i i<br>think it's probably local as well um<br>you know there seems to be a separate<br>between the primary care sector<br>so i think that um regardless of the<br>structure<br>who we have is who we have we don't have<br>any more health providers<br>south of the waitaki river and haas pass<br>so regardless of what structure is<br>the same people are<br>are here<br>um to provide care for our community<br>the structures can enable or make it<br>difficult to work across<br>primary and community into hospital<br>services the culture can make it<br>difficult<br>so you can have an enabling structure<br>and a difficult culture<br>um so<br>and and<br>without disrespect to anybody um i i my<br>sense coming down south is that we've<br>got both<br>and so we probably need to work on both<br>so<br>it's certainly an interesting space to<br>be working in but<br>lots of room for opportunity i think<br>things like covert<br>do actually<br>make you<br>work together because you have to and<br>i'm hoping that the um<br>the the<br>the experience of<br>working together and having good<br>outcomes will be encouraging people to<br>keep doing that as time goes on there's<br>also a<br>certainly a willing group of clinicians<br>in the hospital and primary care space<br>who wants to work together<br>and are starting to have those<br>conversations so<br>it's not going to be fixed overnight but<br>i'm confident that<br>there's um a good group of willing<br>people that<br>that we can make some good progress in<br>this space on i think um changing the<br>the power dynamic between the hospital<br>being the the<br>you know the castle on the hill and<br>general practice being the the kind of<br>the little tents around and the moats<br>around the hill to actually being<br>partners equally will make an enormous<br>difference and um<br>don't get me going on generalism versus<br>specialism i think we need to be<br>partners together not one being<br>predominant over the other<br>so i'm sure this will come up again in<br>the panel discussion<br>um<br>another question from tui smith um<br>asking about the existing barriers that<br>you see to collaboration between primary<br>care and kaupapa maori providers<br>how you think these should be overcome<br>in a practical sense<br>thanks to that's a good question um<br>it's something i've been thinking a<br>little bit about lately realising so a<br>couple of weeks ago so i've been in my<br>new role for maybe a month or so and so<br>a couple of weeks well must be longer<br>than that now three weeks ago four weeks<br>ago i've<br>had the pleasure to meet the majority of<br>the kapha maori providers in our region<br>i'm still a couple of yet to meet<br>and it made me realize that they do a<br>lot of fantastic work and and that<br>actually it's<br>varying levels of penetration into the<br>psyche of general practices in their<br>areas and<br>and you know there's a lot of<br>opportunity there um to do things in a<br>more connected way so<br>i think<br>i think it's about<br>each other knowing what the other does<br>and actually spending a bit of time<br>sharing the air when you're allowed to<br>share air again<br>to get to know who the other other<br>people who are doing good work for your<br>shared patience<br>in in your community is so i think it's<br>just a matter of people getting to know<br>people and then working out look baby<br>steps okay so what are some practical<br>things we can do<br>for this group of patients that will<br>actually improve patient outcome and if<br>we take that<br>perspective then i think that's the way<br>to start moving forward<br>thank you<br>um<br>i'm just watching the questions coming<br>in trying to concentrate on your answers<br>while reading chats and i wonder you<br>know how good journalists does this<br>when you hear these panel discussions on<br>radios<br>so i'm going to read this one out uh<br>it's from a<br>ride uh which um<br>sorry it's just popped down um here it<br>is it's from john coney<br>uh and so it's around<br>um uh<br>the ability to build roles partnerships<br>and training<br>uh in a context that seems to be<br>predetermined before we understand how a<br>primary care system<br>actually works in<br>practice uh and so<br>the question is along the lines of you<br>know i i think are we<br>embedding<br>much of the current activity without<br>really thinking through<br>the<br>model<br>well and that that really um comes back<br>to david's comments about um<br>you know if we're going to do things<br>differently we need to to think<br>differently and not use yesterday's<br>solutions for the future i i think it's<br>an absolutely<br>a very um<br>valid point that we need to be mindful<br>of and i i think<br>because of the tight time frames around<br>all of this<br>we run the risk of not thinking<br>differently<br>and<br>just put up this final comment here uh<br>or question which is around the the gp<br>workforce and perhaps coming back to<br>martin heffern's point as well around<br>remuneration<br>and pay parity um<br>and so the the question is around uh<br>whether we need to strengthen pathways<br>directly to primary care<br>from universities polytechnics tertiary<br>trainers<br>um<br>so would you like to comment on that you<br>know how we reinforce the pathway<br>i'd love to comment on that um thank you<br>for the opportunity um it's slightly<br>off-piste but it's it's connected i i<br>think<br>um<br>and it's about and and the same may well<br>apply in the nursing space and in other<br>health professional space but i can<br>speak to how it applies in the medical<br>space um<br>so<br>we need<br>you know 40-ish depends on who you talk<br>we need about 40<br>of our graduates to become general<br>practitioners to just maintain the<br>current model so that's not talking<br>about i think the figure was 37<br>that was some work health workforce new<br>zealand did a couple of years ago so<br>that's irrespective of that's just doing<br>more of the same and and i would argue<br>that the future we need more<br>um generalists community-based<br>journalists because that's where the<br>work's going to need to be undertaken<br>um currently our pgi<br>sorry our second year<br>medical students across the country<br>20<br>of them<br>um plan to be gps when they at the<br>second year medical school intake and by<br>the end of medical school so you could<br>argue are we even if we need 40<br>are we choosing our kids because they're<br>all capable you know and a lot of people<br>that miss out are capable so we need to<br>be choosing the right people that want<br>to end up in a career in community-based<br>journalism whether that's in general<br>practice or river hospital medicine<br>and uh and then by the end of medical<br>school about 25<br>wants to become<br>general practitioners so that means<br>we've made a small impact but when you<br>look at the weeks and training and the<br>medical curriculum that are spent in<br>general practice and community settings<br>it's it's it's<br>you know maybe i think of 15 weeks out<br>of in the clinical years there's i don't<br>know how many weeks there are a year but<br>um there's<br>it's you know<br>more than 50 or 60 weeks it is a small a<br>tiny part of that time is spent in<br>primary and community settings and we<br>currently<br>um are reviewing the curriculum um<br>how it's delivered in otago four years<br>four five six and the the number of<br>weeks where students are<br>spending time in primary community care<br>it's hardly budged and it's actually<br>gone down by a week<br>in<br>the proposal<br>for otago for dunedin sport of medicine<br>so<br>we're not actually responding to the<br>signals that the system as a university<br>the medical schools aren't responding to<br>the signals from the sector that we need<br>more community-based generalists and<br>then in our early post-grad<br>years that figure goes up to about 27<br>from 25 up to about 27 by the time<br>someone is about pgy six or seven so<br>they're either in training or planning<br>to go into training specialist training<br>soon so every year we're 50 or 60<br>um<br>gps and real hospital nursing doctors<br>short and um<br>if if we don't see that as a critical<br>problem that we have to address um<br>you know<br>all right well thanks very much carol um<br>a lot of uh good feedback coming in so<br>thank you very very much again for your<br>very thoughtful and insightful<br>presentation today you've raised a lot<br>of i think really important questions<br>which you know clearly you're having to<br>put a lot of effort into<br>so we'll see you at 11 15. thanks again</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
