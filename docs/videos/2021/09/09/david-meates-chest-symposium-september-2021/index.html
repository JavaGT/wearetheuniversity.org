will<br>um<br>be<br>doing this morning is not going through<br>and repeating um a number of things<br>within the health reforms but<br>largely to um give some thoughts and<br>views on some of the barriers and<br>enablers<br>that um<br>that<br>bringing about an integrated health<br>system is going to be is going to pose<br>some of the challenges for the<br>uh health reforms that are underway<br>so the intention this morning is really<br>to uh again provoke some<br>thoughts and<br>discussion as we go through<br>as we go through the morning<br>so<br>one of the things that<br>all health systems<br>are dealing with around the world<br>and<br>underpin most of the integration issues<br>that health systems face<br>are really based around decisions of how<br>best to use the amount of resource<br>that is a given in just about every<br>health system in that<br>demand and<br>resourcing<br>are always a point of tension and always<br>a point of<br>how much is enough how much is<br>not enough to deliver a set of outcomes<br>and meet the aspirations of whatever<br>whatever<br>health system or health policies are in<br>place<br>one of the other challenges the<br>different professional and community<br>groups of different interests and<br>priorities which often need to be<br>reconciled<br>and whether that be<br>primary care whether that be hospitals<br>whether that be ngos<br>whether that be um<br>private<br>sector<br>and whether that be uh different<br>government agencies<br>and one of the challenges with that is<br>organizations have interests in their<br>own viability and influences<br>and<br>one of the things that i will touch on a<br>few times through this is too often it<br>is those organizational interests that<br>are brought to bear<br>in any conversation about<br>about integration so one of the<br>challenges that<br>um<br>any journey towards integration is going<br>to require is a way of dealing with<br>and being able to give a sense of or how<br>to deal with viability and<br>people sense of<br>who they are working for<br>one of the other big challenges is that<br>information is often unclear<br>and only available in the longer term or<br>incomplete<br>and what i mean by that is<br>too much of what we have and base our<br>thinking on and health is based on<br>historical<br>data sets and trends<br>and often poorly understood<br>and<br>often lacking the context of the systems<br>they sit<br>within<br>and one of the biggest challenges with<br>any health system journey to integration<br>or a different way of working<br>it is so easy to get trapped in<br>short-term adversarial positions in a<br>zero-sum game and when you have a fixed<br>amount of resource<br>and the battles around where that<br>resource has been allocated<br>it is so easy to<br>get caught into<br>that is the argument or debate as<br>opposed to what are the enablers what<br>are the things that actually are going<br>to enable<br>us<br>as a system to<br>some of the other challenges within um<br>the journey towards system integration<br>is there are significant increases in<br>demand for and complexity of services<br>that are delivered<br>and<br>whether that is in the community<br>i.e um individuals or families grappling<br>with their own<br>their own health through primary care<br>through to the<br>secondary part of the the health system<br>there's also a significant<br>um change in demographics<br>with a growing and aging population<br>which bring its own bring about its own<br>set of challenges and particularly<br>in the context where somewhere around<br>about 50<br>of all health spend is spent in the last<br>two years of life<br>and again it does start posing some of<br>the other sort of challenges and issues<br>about resource allocation and where and<br>what the emphasis is going to be<br>in any health system going forward<br>there's also the change the expectations<br>of work and workplace by those that are<br>employed within health<br>you know the<br>the the days of doctors<br>working<br>interesting hours on the on the basis of<br>their contribution to a community or to<br>a service<br>is something that is changing markedly<br>the way that um those you know kind of<br>nursing expectations about<br>um<br>and dealing with some of the<br>complexities of care being provided what<br>is the expectation<br>of providing safe and appropriate<br>care<br>there are significant challenges and<br>opportunities from technological and<br>scientific innovation<br>and too often<br>innovation<br>and technological solutions are being<br>offered up as the magic bullet for a<br>different health system<br>and i think one of the challenges around<br>um innovation<br>and technology is we've got to remember<br>that they are enablers<br>they are not in themselves in the end<br>destination<br>and too often<br>i think we confuse some of those the<br>other bit too is the word innovation<br>is innovation is often implied as<br>something inherently good<br>and it is interesting looking back at<br>the um<br>you know the big financial crisis that<br>we had back in the mid 2000s that was<br>some of the most innovative innovative<br>um packaging of um rubbish<br>uh<br>um investment<br>tools<br>uh that caused a lot of harm and so<br>we've got to be careful too if not<br>buying into the phone to the that<br>innovation is in itself inherently<br>going to take us to a different or<br>better place<br>legacy facility issues and the<br>unprecedented pressures on constrained<br>capital and i just want you to think<br>about at the moment there is a<br>estimated shortfall just in the<br>secondary part of the health system of<br>somewhere in the order of about 17<br>billion<br>of capital and if you just put that into<br>context<br>that's a one billion dollar hospital<br>being built every year for the next 17<br>years and you just put into the context<br>of<br>the<br>dunedin hospital<br>the length of time that is going to take<br>to be delivered<br>and to then come to life just gives you<br>an indication of the lead time for a lot<br>of these uh you know kind of capital<br>projects now it does raise an<br>interesting issue if we were requiring<br>today to deliver one one billion dollar<br>project every year for the next 17 to 20<br>years<br>um<br>that is really<br>starting to provide a very clear<br>expectation that we will have facility<br>constraints<br>as a chronic part of our health system<br>the other component is the unrelenting<br>mentor about the need to do more with<br>the same or less resource<br>that has been the mantra within health<br>for as long as i can remember<br>it is the thing that is<br>continues to play the<br>huge amount an immense amount of<br>pressure onto systems and those that<br>work within systems<br>and while that can work for periods of<br>time<br>there does come across over point<br>where actually demand<br>doesn't then match resource<br>and at some particular point um the<br>challenge of actually how you rebalance<br>a system<br>and i think the<br>the construct of continuing to believe<br>that we can deliver more for less<br>is something that we need to just be<br>very cautious about in terms of actually<br>the evidence and the science that<br>actually sits behind that<br>legacy i t systems and challenges<br>brought with that and the dilemma and<br>difficulty of<br>uh moving to integrated systems<br>is a multi-year<br>journey<br>and often<br>and<br>if you look into the you know out over<br>the next decade<br>there is going to be a lot of legacy<br>systems that are going to continue to<br>require band-aids and rubber bands to<br>hold them together<br>while new i.t systems are continued to<br>be built<br>and implemented<br>and i think there's a bit of a<br>sense of<br>simplicity when people describe new<br>systems and thinking they're somehow<br>going to be almost in place by tomorrow<br>there are some different pathways to get<br>there but i think the challenge we have<br>is are we good enough as a country to<br>grapple with that<br>i guess the growing shortages of people<br>and the increasing mismatch of global<br>supply and demand<br>again is something that is going to<br>continue to be a feature of our health<br>system and many other health systems<br>and as we look forward to the new health<br>reforms these are just some of the<br>challenges that are going to be going to<br>continue to face<br>will need to be dealt with<br>with whatever framework is developed<br>and that is before and i've deliberately<br>not mentioned too much about covet<br>because the danger with covet is<br>um and certainly a lot of work<br>have been doing internationally more<br>recently is the sense that<br>covert has enabled a whole lot of<br>collaboration and new innovation and<br>moving to digital platforms<br>and it's really really fascinating to<br>already see those systems under pressure<br>to revert back to business as usual<br>catching up and unmet demand<br>catching up with care that hasn't been<br>delivered<br>and all of those are like magnets<br>pulling their systems back to what they<br>were doing beforehand<br>and so there is a real danger that a lot<br>of the gains and innovations have<br>emerged in response to covet<br>are less likely to stick<br>as we drop them into systems that are<br>not designed<br>to really support them and that's<br>something i'll come back to<br>a week later as well<br>so with all of that we<br>end up<br>looking at health systems with lots of<br>different parts and<br>and<br>the challenge that we have<br>and that new zealand has many other<br>health systems have is how do you in<br>fact rearrange those pieces to make them<br>a coherent whole<br>and<br>that is i think the context that we're<br>increasingly needing to look through the<br>lens of the proposed or not the proposed<br>the new the health reforms that are<br>about to happen in new zealand<br>is<br>are those<br>actually going to enable a different<br>system to emerge from that<br>i guess the beautiful part about this is<br>it's not an unusual problem<br>um<br>and<br>there's several elements that um just<br>wanted to highlight with this um here is<br>particularly around policy analysis and<br>individual solutions are not clearly<br>right or wrong<br>but there are disputed definitions of<br>public good<br>and i think it's a really important part<br>when we're looking at policy context in<br>the context of actually then a system<br>operating and working differently<br>complex systems<br>we tend to continue to<br>pilot solutions and then look to roll<br>them out<br>and i'm going to come back to that in a<br>bit because pilots and projects have got<br>an inherent fail mechanism<br>that prevent them from scaling<br>and it's one of the things that people<br>don't understand in terms of system<br>thinking and system and complex systems<br>change<br>is that when you pilot something in a<br>particular situation and then take it<br>somewhere else you've automatically<br>changed the context that their pilot<br>worked and operated within<br>it's one of the biggest barriers as to<br>why things don't<br>shift or get adopted as quickly as many<br>people would like within health systems<br>the other challenge there is the common<br>appalled resource problem<br>and<br>again highlighting that ordinary market<br>mechanisms are unlikely to work well<br>and generally speaking may be more<br>costly<br>and dysfunction can result in short-term<br>horizons and resource depletion<br>and for any of you that have<br>you know kind of want to read a really<br>interesting<br>background on that<br>is<br>a piece called the tragedy of the<br>commons<br>written by or developed by eleanor<br>ostrom<br>many many years ago and it gives a<br>really good insight in terms of the<br>conundrum and challenge<br>about resource<br>and how to apply resource and the<br>unintended or the consequences of<br>actually getting that<br>wrong<br>and the problem with common pooled<br>resources too that some communities can<br>develop institutions which work<br>and others<br>struggle<br>so again<br>just wanting to<br>um<br>you know<br>again stimulate the thinking about<br>actually some of the things that get in<br>the way of integration<br>so i'm going to spend just a tiny bit of<br>time with some of the<br>barriers or the things that are going to<br>get in the way<br>of<br>of any<br>change or proposed change within<br>any system<br>first one is the disconnect between<br>policy and delivery<br>it's interesting that we are moving down<br>a pathway of shifting or separating<br>policy<br>from delivery<br>uh<br>i think increasingly<br>there is a pool of evidence that is<br>arising that would suggest that actually<br>when you separate policy from delivery<br>you end up with policy<br>and or direction that is less likely to<br>be delivered because in fact you do not<br>have the allocation or the alignment of<br>resourcing<br>the other barrier is a lack of a common<br>purpose or the why<br>and i think it's a really important part<br>of any change is being able to<br>for those that work within systems and<br>for communities<br>to have<br>and understand the why<br>it is going to be different and why the<br>difference is going to make a<br>make it better for people's health<br>the basis that actually there are<br>theaters in one hospital that are not<br>being fully utilized and people can<br>shift to another area to access theaters<br>is not a very compelling reason<br>so i'm just using that as an example in<br>terms of we've got to be thoughtful<br>about actually what it is and why things<br>need to be different<br>health is wonderful at creating a<br>complicated language<br>that generally speaking only those that<br>in health and sometimes those in health<br>don't necessarily understand it either<br>but it does mean that it becomes very<br>difficult for<br>communities to either understand<br>what is happening and whether things are<br>any better<br>the lack of ins of systems thinking<br>and that's the<br>misalignment<br>of incentives or levers<br>and<br>if we get continue to go through any<br>change that is linked to activity-based<br>funding<br>so those of you that work within that in<br>terms of<br>fee for service or<br>um caseway based funding<br>uh within uh within hospitals<br>those will continue<br>to be an impediment to moving to a<br>different endpoint<br>because activity-based funding drives<br>perverse incentives you need to do more<br>activity to generate more income or to<br>generate more funding<br>and when that is at odds with keeping<br>more people out of hospital<br>and providing more care in a community<br>setting it is really important to<br>understand the incentives and the levers<br>short-term planning horizons and<br>responding to symptoms not problems<br>and one of the dilemmas that we have is<br>actually when you have a bit of noise<br>occurring<br>that is what people respond to<br>that is what politicians respond to<br>that is actually<br>often what decision makers end up<br>responding to<br>and<br>dealing with symptoms is not a great way<br>for bringing about change or bringing<br>about<br>a systematic way of thinking or doing<br>things differently<br>the system<br>generally that people<br>will need to be working within<br>are often not built by those that<br>inherit it<br>so<br>you've got to be careful that we don't<br>bastardize the term<br>co-design which increasingly has been<br>used<br>to justify that actually it has been you<br>know kind of people have been involved<br>and i'll come back on to that one<br>data<br>looking at the wrong data for desired<br>outcomes so looking at data to<br>demonstrate and prove a different<br>endpoint is not an effective way of<br>using data<br>data for it to be meaningful you need to<br>let patterns emerge from that and some<br>of those can actually be quite<br>uncomfortable<br>but if you're really going to use data<br>in making data informed decisions about<br>outcomes<br>we need to think differently and<br>approach the way the data is being used<br>and i'd suggest at the moment is that is<br>a significant<br>gap in the skill sets in many health<br>systems<br>partnership between organizations and<br>partners is if you expect<br>people that have been at each other's<br>throats for the last decade or two<br>to suddenly<br>and talk about collaboration<br>it's a difficult expectation or it's a<br>difficult thing to expect those parties<br>to do<br>if<br>some other mechanisms don't change<br>and i think the failure to listen and<br>not having the right people in the rooms<br>is actually going to be something that<br>many um many parties are going to need<br>to be thoughtful about<br>if we're really going to bring about<br>one thing from<br>long experience is when we talk about<br>change the two things that often sit at<br>the table the beginning of those<br>conversations are funding<br>and contracts<br>and if you want two things that are<br>going to prevent anything changing<br>that's the best way to start a<br>conversation<br>because funding and contracts<br>basically<br>give you the out by describing what<br>you're not funded for or what you can't<br>do<br>and i think we're going to need to look<br>at how to step away from some of those<br>funding mechanisms that we have at the<br>moment<br>to look at how those how funding is used<br>in a way that is going to enable<br>and not construct change<br>and increasingly i think it's the<br>challenge of actually what we mean by<br>commissioning<br>and commissioning too often is about<br>some very bright people determining what<br>needs to happen and then posing it on a<br>system<br>that for me is not commissioning<br>commissioning increasingly needs to be<br>about working with those that are<br>involved in the delivery of care and<br>with communities<br>to work out actually what is the best<br>way of delivering care and then looking<br>at how do we use funding to support and<br>bring that bring that to life<br>so i think there is going to be a<br>challenge<br>in the role or the way that<br>commissioning is thought of within the<br>system<br>one of the other barriers to integrated<br>care is too often we're looking<br>backwards and using the tools of<br>yesterday to try and solve the<br>challenges of tomorrow<br>and<br>what<br>health can be expert about is bringing<br>all the baggage<br>all the grievances from the last decades<br>with<br>and that somehow<br>we bring all of that<br>to the table<br>while we're trying to look at solving<br>a different set of problems and a<br>different set of challenges into the<br>future<br>and i think too often we're not facing<br>the future and looking at how we solve<br>the problems of the future in the<br>context the future not the past<br>and i think that is again<br>um<br>at times when i see<br>some of the tools the<br>the language being used<br>it's stuff that actually<br>goes right back to the 80s 90s and<br>early 2000s it's just dressed up in<br>another set of clothes<br>the other bit is that we can often<br>confuse activity with change<br>and<br>that's where structural change is a<br>really good way<br>of masking actually is anything<br>happening which or in fact<br>moving to a different space because it<br>gives the sense of activity it gives a<br>sense that something is happening<br>but generally those are often at the<br>peripheral not at the core and heart of<br>actually what needs to be<br>need to be different<br>as i touched on before the use of pilots<br>and projects<br>they have a fundamental fail mechanism<br>in them<br>that prevents them from scaling and<br>that's to do with actually the<br>contextual<br>element that they are often developed<br>and trialled within<br>and<br>increasingly<br>you look at just at most systems across<br>the world and in most health systems you<br>see some really really brilliant pilots<br>and projects<br>that seem to have a lot of evidence<br>sitting behind them that a couple of<br>years later you look back and think what<br>ever happened to those and why have<br>those not been picked up and adopted<br>and again it comes back to<br>what i touched on before is the lack of<br>understanding system science and system<br>thinking<br>it is very different from pilots and<br>projects<br>the other bit that is a barrier to<br>change is new initiatives<br>and people come up with actually we have<br>got a new bit of funding<br>to<br>bring to life a<br>a new service<br>the problem is that we drop that back<br>into the existing systems and existing<br>operating models and then wonder why<br>again<br>the outcomes that we thought might have<br>happened<br>actually don't happen<br>so<br>again if you continue to drop things<br>into existing operating models<br>it is unlikely<br>metrics of the past are not relevant to<br>the future<br>if we're<br>really talking about systems<br>and outcomes<br>then counting widgets is probably not<br>the right way to measure that<br>and<br>yet<br>they are often the only things that<br>systems believe or have a sense that<br>they can count so the number of<br>hospitalizations number of first<br>specialist assessments the number of gp<br>visits<br>the number of age residential care beds<br>um<br>are all widgets<br>they don't actually give a sense of<br>is the system making a difference to a<br>set of outcomes<br>and what i would describe is probably 90<br>of most of the metrics we're currently<br>using in health<br>have got little alignment or linkage<br>with outcomes<br>and yet those are the things that we're<br>continuing to make decisions about<br>i think it's one of the big challenges<br>that if we are going to move to a<br>different outcome or different space or<br>a different system<br>we're fundamentally needing to rethink<br>actually what are the metrics<br>that are going to support<br>and demonstrate<br>and<br>and provide<br>evidence that in fact what we're doing<br>is making a difference<br>one of the other big challenges is the<br>continued use of small centrally<br>appointed expert groups deciding what<br>needs to happen<br>with very little understanding<br>of the system that the changes need to<br>reside in<br>and<br>i'm still yet to see many systems where<br>we don't overuse a small group of people<br>to keep on coming up with solutions<br>and then wonder why those solutions<br>don't<br>get actually rolled out or picked up<br>and part of that is this clash between<br>how you take um small group thinking or<br>small expert group thinking to a wider<br>system understanding hand ownership<br>and therein lies part of the<br>again what have come back to<br>understanding system science and system<br>change very different from pilots and<br>projects to bring those about<br>and one of the other bits is actually<br>then the role of leadership and<br>governance and<br>again the levels of capability and<br>competency<br>to<br>bring about and support and enable<br>a different endpoint<br>and i think if we<br>kind of one of the challenges we often<br>have is<br>the same people or the same leaders or<br>parts of the system that are involved in<br>the<br>blast system not working are somehow<br>involved in making a new system<br>magically come to life<br>it does raise some interesting questions<br>in terms of have we got the right<br>capability and competencies<br>to help<br>take us to a different state<br>a few of the other<br>challenges that<br>you know in terms of the journey for<br>integration and certainly in the new<br>zealand health context and world context<br>things like<br>the impacts of covet<br>and many<br>many places in many countries the world<br>by covert is going to be a feature<br>of those health landscapes for a long<br>period of time<br>and things like cancer for instance<br>certainly in the uk if you look at some<br>of the modelling sitting there it really<br>is going to be up until about 2028<br>before the impacts<br>or before<br>the<br>catcher<br>on<br>deferred cancer treatments and other and<br>other elements associated with that are<br>likely to be caught up<br>workforce demands increasingly we've got<br>workforces that are tired<br>that have<br>that have been working and stretched and<br>often chronically<br>or under resourced areas<br>and again expecting<br>more<br>and<br>enabling change in that environment does<br>pose a slightly different conundrum in<br>the way that things will need to be<br>approached<br>uh inadequate facilities uh we've<br>touched on before<br>the work environment<br>and again we're starting to see the<br>pressures and challenges on across a lot<br>of the health workforce<br>in terms of<br>wanting and indeed demanding a different<br>environment<br>for<br>them to continue to work in<br>and i think one of the big challenges<br>again is<br>loss of loss of optimism or loss of hope<br>long time frames and feeling undervalued<br>and that is again one of the<br>big challenges when you're talking about<br>a largely people based<br>system<br>is<br>people need to have<br>a sense of hope and optimism<br>and engagement if<br>if they're going to be<br>part of<br>creating a new<br>endpoint<br>there's an old adage you can't leave the<br>chasm one step at a time at a time<br>and we've got to be careful we don't<br>confuse this with actually a structural<br>change because structure<br>doesn't often lead to a different<br>endpoint<br>unless you've changed the system that it<br>works and supports<br>so<br>it is one of the interesting things in<br>health is there's a strong evidential<br>basis for<br>a way that care should be provided<br>the<br>we tend to take a very incremental<br>approach to that taking small steps on<br>the basis of actually it will<br>impact on professional groups<br>it won't be acceptable to communities<br>um<br>it is going to create some noise<br>and too often as a consequence of that<br>we continue to take small steps they<br>give a sense of activity or forward<br>movement but really it is actually<br>maintaining and sustaining the status<br>quo<br>so what are some of the key enablers<br>to bringing<br>to life a different<br>endpoint<br>one of the truisms is that change<br>happens at the speed of trust<br>is that<br>you need to have those that work within<br>a system<br>that are trusted that are enabled<br>to do<br>and to bring to life a different<br>endpoint<br>and<br>if that's not the case what you'll tend<br>to find is<br>the ability to move to a different<br>endpoint becomes a long<br>drawn out<br>and often complex challenge<br>need to be really clear clear on the why<br>why is this going to make a difference<br>if the why is about cutting costs it's<br>not likely to resonate with those that<br>work within health<br>however if it's about making it better<br>for how i work or where i work or the<br>outcomes for patients that is something<br>that many people can get their head<br>around<br>need to create an enabling environment<br>where people feel that they can make a<br>difference<br>if it is constrained by<br>more<br>rules and regulations<br>again it is likely to then become an<br>impediment as opposed to an enabler<br>diversity of thought<br>is really really important in terms of<br>actually changing the way that services<br>are provided locally<br>having the community as part of that is<br>a really important part<br>of<br>actually<br>starting to get things<br>aligning funding mechanisms and<br>operating models to desired outcomes<br>you can't keep on dropping the same<br>things into the same system and expect a<br>different<br>and be wary of consultants<br>in mantra<br>those that come up with the really<br>simple solutions<br>be very very<br>um thoughtful about those<br>um<br>and<br>also um that element in terms of where<br>all of us stand within a system<br>of<br>gives or<br>creates a set it creates a bias of how<br>we see what might some of the solutions<br>might be<br>if i work in one area that is absolutely<br>broken and<br>dysfunctional<br>i will often<br>assume that that is the same experience<br>that everyone else is having within<br>health<br>so<br>again it's it's really important that we<br>don't bring our own biases um yeah kind<br>of to that<br>one thing that is fundamentally<br>and<br>if we're really going to bring about a<br>different outcome<br>we need to ensure that actually we've<br>got those that work within health<br>understand their contribution<br>and that would be best described in<br>terms of i have a real sense of purpose<br>and value<br>second one is everyone can get this can<br>get stuff done<br>i have what i need to do my job well<br>the third one is everyone is empowered<br>to make it better<br>and i am part of shaping the future<br>because if you're part of shaping the<br>future you're more likely to be invested<br>in a different set of outcomes<br>everyone is unable to lead i can take<br>the lead with people around me<br>if i have got to wait for approvals<br>up the chain<br>and<br>it's<br>likely to be incredibly disempowering<br>experience<br>the fifth one is everyone is supported<br>to thrive and i can do and be my very<br>best<br>those five<br>simple elements around people go to the<br>core heart of what is called culture<br>of what is<br>some of the mechanisms that actually<br>enable<br>change<br>or different ways of thinking to land<br>into<br>where things are likely to thrive and to<br>continue to be<br>nourished<br>so<br>a summary of the next<br>wave of change and i guess this is the<br>bit that really brings all of us<br>together in terms of if you're going to<br>bring together a different endpoint is<br>the sense of collective ownership<br>you can't have<br>all these different organizations and<br>existing structures coming together<br>when they're worried about their<br>viability sustainability their sense of<br>purpose and their sense of identity<br>the shared insight in learning<br>making sure that data and information is<br>visible transparent<br>co-owned<br>coordination<br>not<br>people<br>small groups coming together<br>centrally or regionally<br>and calling that co-design<br>and then banging that into a system is<br>not co-owned coordination<br>having a shared orientation<br>and that is in fact all parts of the<br>system having a sense of<br>what it is that they are trying to<br>achieve<br>collective reinvestment<br>one of the things that<br>is always fascinating in terms of we<br>often talk about<br>um<br>wanting to reduce the number of people<br>in hospitals<br>and yet hospitals are funded on activity<br>then we talk about shifting funding from<br>hospitals to primary care<br>and all we've done is ended up with a<br>net zero sum game of conflict<br>because<br>if the hospital's only ability to<br>justify more resources more activity<br>and your funding mechanisms are linked<br>to that<br>then it is unlikely<br>there will be much engagement into<br>supporting primary care to support more<br>people to be<br>cared for in a community setting<br>and the final bit of that is high trust<br>data integration<br>and being able to have shared and<br>collective sharing of data in a way that<br>is<br>timely and what i mean by timely<br>is available today<br>helping decisions of today be made in<br>the context of today<br>tomorrow<br>weekly quarterly and yearly<br>the one thing is actually<br>it can't be<br>any of those exclusively it does need to<br>so<br>just a wee thought is that every system<br>is perfectly designed to achieve the<br>results<br>that it achieves and that's a<br>statement from don burwick<br>that<br>and if we're really<br>going to bring to life a<br>citizen-centric system or an integrated<br>health system<br>that is centered around people<br>that aims not to waste their time<br>then the conundrum and the challenge i<br>think we all have is are we actually up<br>for that<br>and are the mechanisms and the levers<br>that we think we are about to do<br>going to in fact enable us to get to a<br>different<br>outcome<br>and finally<br>wee lesson this comes from rudolph<br>clines in 2004 and while this relates to<br>the nhs it is<br>quite reflective of actually the<br>challenge and the journey that the nhs<br>has been on<br>um<br>so despite the additional money flowing<br>into the system and despite the enticing<br>vision of a service that combines<br>healthcare that is universal<br>comprehensive and free at point of<br>delivery with choice flexibility and<br>responsiveness<br>controversy and discontent still dogged<br>the nhs<br>central management of the nhs created<br>and reinforced the command and control<br>system<br>why could not the good practices of some<br>trust in reducing waiting lists<br>improving the quality of patient care<br>providing quick service and emergency<br>departments and so on be generalized<br>introducing a plethora of service<br>targets inspection regimes and national<br>standards although justified in order to<br>attack the challenge of variation have<br>become counterproductive<br>without greater diversity the nhs cannot<br>be more responsive<br>without responsiveness there cannot be<br>public confidence without public<br>confidence the nhs will not be<br>sustainable<br>demand and control model has many<br>perverse<br>effects but also reflected a realization<br>that centralizing power means<br>centralizing blame<br>a larger difficulty is devising a<br>structure and a set of incentives that<br>will ensure that the added resources are<br>used efficiently<br>and that the policy goal of making the<br>nhs consumer orientated is achieved so<br>just leave that thought with you from<br>2004<br>so<br>hopefully that<br>has<br>and will provide a wee bit of food for<br>thought<br>as<br>new zealand embarks on a health system<br>reform<br>that<br>focused or largely meant to be focused<br>on ensuring a better set of outcomes for<br>well david uh thank you very very much<br>um<br>now i hope i'm not having trouble with<br>my technology i'm not able to tell if we<br>have anything coming in on the chat room<br>um<br>and i'm hoping you can hear me david can<br>you put your thumb up if you can hear me<br>yep i can hear everything is okay if my<br>slide's still on the screen or<br>uh yes it is at the moment<br>right um look thank you david so i'll<br>and i just want to pick up on your point<br>around systems thinking<br>so i think this is<br>going to be a<br>a serious challenge as<br>as we move into the next phase of reform<br>or commence this phase of reform in this<br>country<br>um i'm just interested in your thinking<br>around<br>you know what needs to shift and then<br>what are the core components of systems<br>thinking that we need to be thinking<br>about<br>embedding developing or developing<br>perhaps in the first place and then<br>embedding across the health system<br>in this country<br>i think one of the the challenges<br>at the moment um<br>that that i would i would see is there's<br>been a lot<br>most of the conversation a lot of the<br>focus has been on structural change<br>and<br>um<br>that's<br>again<br>structural change<br>generally doesn't lead to a different<br>set of outcomes if structural change is<br>the only thing that is occurring<br>and<br>at the moment it is hard to get a sense<br>of<br>what are some of the other elements that<br>are in fact going to<br>um you're going to have going to be<br>brought<br>brought to life<br>the<br>separation and i think the slide<br>robin that you brought up at the<br>beginning<br>where you've got<br>hospitals and primary care<br>starting to be separated again in terms<br>of the way that they've been thought<br>about and looked at<br>is actually<br>at odds<br>if you are<br>really going to<br>bring about<br>a different set of outcomes<br>so it does more end again the separation<br>of policy<br>and funding<br>makes<br>the opportunity for a lot of different<br>silos<br>to be created and different silos to<br>emerge that in fact don't necessarily<br>take us a lot closer to an integrated<br>and integrated solution<br>so<br>the challenge<br>the challenge we have is at the moment<br>is the focus on um is the focus on<br>structural change<br>there's a lot of speed associated with<br>structural change with deadlines given<br>you know kind of through and you know<br>kind of through to next year<br>and that happening in one of the<br>biggest health challenges<br>internationally called covert<br>does create a<br>set of circumstances that<br>we could quite quickly as a country get<br>into real buggers model<br>because what we're really wanting to<br>think about is what are the mechanisms<br>that are underpinning that that are<br>going to lead to a different bet a<br>different set of outcomes<br>what is going to enable<br>a system to support general practice<br>and community services to provide more<br>care in a community setting<br>because that won't happen by magic<br>already we've got a primary care that is<br>under<br>immense amount of pressure<br>there's a lot of challenges about<br>actually what the business model for<br>primary care should be into the into the<br>future<br>there is the challenge with hospitals in<br>terms of<br>increasingly the messages and the<br>signals are as if you're unwell<br>go to hospital and that again is still a<br>bit contrary<br>to<br>how do you provide and support more<br>people to be supported<br>kind of in a community<br>so at the moment i think there's a<br>there's a there's a<br>muddled set of<br>of um<br>of rationale as to what it is we're<br>actually trying to achieve<br>and something at the moment where i<br>think there's a lot of optimism that<br>somehow something has got to be better<br>than what has existed<br>but there's actually no clarity about<br>actually what that different will be<br>and<br>from bitter experience over many decades<br>in health<br>um hope or pushing something to be<br>different is not necessarily a great<br>plan<br>so<br>so at the moment i think we've got a<br>we've actually got quite a significant<br>void focus on procedures on structural<br>change on<br>on<br>other change and i do reflect that<br>having worked in health in the 90s where<br>the<br>thunder provider split was so<br>indelibly beaten into everyone<br>and 20 years after that<br>the impacts of that sort of<br>mantra and change<br>is still quite evident<br>in the psyche of our system<br>and<br>kind of get a sense we're kind of<br>recreating or seem to be dressing up<br>some of those some of those activities<br>and calling it a future as opposed to<br>is that and what is it inherently going<br>turn now to a question that's come<br>through on the chat room i've shifted<br>computers and this one seems to be<br>working this is from mark shirley<br>and he's asking<br>a question around the difficulties of<br>measuring success and wondering what<br>comments you have about<br>what should be measured to determine<br>success as we focus on outputs not<br>inputs<br>um<br>there's<br>there's there's a few elements that um<br>i'd suggest sitting um<br>in the thinking one is um<br>time<br>using time is a metric within health<br>um<br>the and what i mean by that is um we<br>design our health systems with cues<br>in mind<br>so you've got to wait to see a gp and<br>you've got to wait<br>to get to ed and we will make you wait<br>for six hours<br>um<br>then<br>you spend a lot of time lying around the<br>hospital waiting for a number of things<br>to happen and<br>i think if we used a metric of time and<br>just about everything that we did<br>we might end up with a slightly<br>different<br>outcome and importantly within that is<br>valuing the patient or the citizens time<br>um<br>to me that is still the most fundamental<br>part in any system<br>is actually the end user actually<br>valuing their time<br>and we tend to design our systems around<br>what suits us and what's easy for us you<br>know to organize our work activity um<br>round<br>the other but and again<br>um<br>you've got your your kind of high level<br>um some of the high level outcome um<br>measures and you know kind of in terms<br>of<br>um<br>you know things like vaccination rates<br>or um you know kind of those those type<br>of things<br>being really clear about if that's the<br>outcome we're trying to achieve how do<br>we align the system to actually deliver<br>that<br>and we've spoken year after year decade<br>after decade wanting to achieve a<br>different outcome<br>and yet we continue to measure all of<br>the inputs that are going in there so<br>one of the fundamental things is we've<br>got to stop me you know kind of we've<br>got to stop putting the primacy on the<br>inputs<br>i'm going to see a gp do i need to see a<br>gp every visit no i don't<br>but there are certain conditions where<br>i've got a complex chronic condition<br>that in fact that general practice team<br>absolutely should be the experts and<br>care and and the support and pace to<br>provide and enable that care to be<br>provided<br>um<br>and yet we've got a funding mechanism<br>that still brings most people back to<br>those short-term visits or contacts and<br>i think you know kind of those sort of<br>the challenges we've got<br>um we've got the misalignment of the<br>incentives and the levers to bring about<br>a different element<br>um to yesterday's widget thinking so<br>it's a long-winded way of saying<br>i think one of the biggest things we<br>need to start thinking about is actually<br>time within<br>health<br>and time from a patient's point of view<br>or a citizen's point of view<br>the flip side of that is actually time<br>for you as clinicians actually generally<br>most of you know the things that get in<br>the way that are really stupid to do<br>that you end up tolerating day after day<br>and year after year<br>oh thank you that's a really important<br>observation i'm sure it's it's really<br>resonated with<br>with everyone here today i um<br>i guess the question is what's it what<br>what to do about this in practical terms<br>into the future<br>i'm guessing it's something that health<br>nz is going to have to pick up on if it<br>gets the opportunity if it gets the time<br>to focus on it<br>the the the the deep concern is that<br>centralized<br>change has<br>generally not been that successful<br>because<br>the focus on<br>actually micro systems and people within<br>them are generally not understood the<br>further and further you away from from<br>those systems<br>and as a consequence i think it's one of<br>the foul mechanisms in most health<br>systems around the world<br>is continuing to think that actually<br>someone remotely can decide what needs<br>to happen<br>and then expect a different outcome so<br>for me at the moment is actually the um<br>the<br>focus on actually<br>system design<br>is not there<br>and core<br>and at the heart of systems are people<br>we're still a people based<br>industry<br>and while technology will play an<br>increasingly important part<br>it will be an increasingly important<br>part of enabling the humans in the<br>system<br>to work differently we will still have a<br>human-based<br>economic system i think<br>um<br>at the moment we're still a wee bit<br>focused on some quick short-term<br>solutions<br>as opposed to being really clear what is<br>the problem we think we're trying to<br>solve<br>what is the outcome that we actually<br>think<br>needs to be different<br>we'll take uh one one last question from<br>the chat room there's several good ones<br>coming in but this one's from um<br>sharon payne<br>and um<br>she's uh saying that to truly respect<br>time requires a high level of system<br>operations and understanding and<br>management so it's the management<br>question operational excellence<br>sometimes people might refer to here<br>do you think we have the means to get<br>there<br>no<br>at the moment and and i think what we've<br>again it's it's a wee bit in terms of<br>we've<br>we're continuing to look backwards to<br>create solutions for tomorrow<br>as opposed to and and if i look if you<br>think of the skills required to bring<br>collaborative systems to life if you've<br>been brought up in a system that's<br>inherently competitive<br>fighting and scrapping over crumbs of<br>funding<br>fighting and scrapping over<br>pilots and projects and and support that<br>and tomorrow<br>you're expected to collaborate<br>and in that collaboration<br>there is something that needs to happen<br>on that is someone needs to give<br>something up or to let something go and<br>yet we're holding individuals<br>and organizations to account for a<br>different set of metrics<br>and so<br>what i mean by the know is<br>we've inherently got those conflicts<br>that are likely to be embedded into any<br>new system going forward<br>and it's those conflicts that will<br>actually get in the way<br>of<br>a different outcome so there's a need to<br>find a different way and a different set<br>of skills<br>required to enable that to happen and<br>that's where leadership is going to be a<br>fundamental<br>you know kind of expectation of this but<br>how do system leaders get incentivized<br>and held accountable for system measures<br>not for organization a or b or c<br>because they are quite different<br>and so i think there isn't um<br>really the thinking or the mechanisms in<br>place<br>at the moment<br>and until some of those come into place<br>we're probably going to struggle<br>to<br>have the emphasis on a different set of<br>system outcomes as opposed to<br>well thank you david i think we should<br>draw it to a close now and take a brief<br>break and i'm just going to read out an<br>observation that's come in that will<br>probably be picked up on in the panel<br>discussion<br>um after 11am which is uh your great<br>overview has made me ask and this is<br>from john kearney<br>the question has the government<br>understood the problem they are trying<br>to solve and clearly articulated that<br>so let's so david thank you very very<br>much again um let's take a brief break<br>and we'll come back at 10 past 10 so go<br>and get a biscuit um<br>glass of water cup of tea and thanks<br>very much again david and</p></main><footer
