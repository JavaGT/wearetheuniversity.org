here<br>today<br>my name is zoe bristow i'm the<br>co-director in the maori health<br>workforce development unit<br>within kohatsu center for hawaii maori<br>within the division of health sciences<br>and i'm going to pass over to you<br>uh<br>it's fantastic to see so many friendly<br>faces out there thank you for attending<br>uh so my name is peter crampton and i'll<br>be taking part in this presentation<br>uh so the hats that i'm speaking with<br>today<br>uh my my current hat is as a professor<br>of public health in kohatu the center<br>for holder maori<br>i bring with me past roles<br>and in particular i'll be referring to<br>activities uh that were undertaken when<br>i was pro vice chancellor of the<br>division of health sciences and uh dean<br>of the otago medical school those roles<br>are behind me but i will be referring<br>back to those days uh kia ora everybody<br>and thank you so much for coming along<br>to our talk on the mirror on society<br>selection policy<br>i stand here<br>as someone<br>a lot<br>alongside peter as someone who wears<br>multiple hats<br>perhaps the main hat i wear in doing<br>this is as someone who's incredibly<br>passionate about<br>maori health and health equity<br>but i'm also a public health medicine<br>physician who's got a background in<br>maori health and equity i'm the<br>associate dean maori for the division of<br>health sciences and the professor for<br>maori health with the dunedin school of<br>medicine<br>i have sat on all of the division of<br>health sciences admissions committees<br>for a number of years and have been on<br>the medical admissions committee for<br>over two decades<br>and finally the other hat i wear as as<br>one of the maori members on new<br>zealand's national health workforce<br>so we're at an important milestone as we<br>navigate through the 10th year of the<br>mirror on society policy<br>this year has raised the profile of the<br>policy and generated a great deal of<br>interest<br>it is thus opportune in the light of the<br>10-year anniversary and the interest in<br>the policy to give this talk<br>i will be providing an overview of the<br>why<br>in the big picture context underpinning<br>the policy<br>peter will follow with a discussion<br>about the policy itself<br>and so we will then drill down into some<br>of the really effective approaches we're<br>taking to support equity<br>in this talk we are foregrounding maori<br>as tangata tiriti and as the focus of<br>our talk however we also recognise that<br>this is a really important journey of<br>equity<br>for other whanau and i particularly wish<br>to acknowledge our wonderful pacifica<br>whanau<br>here at the front of the room who have<br>walked alongside us on this journey so<br>we acknowledge you in your journey also<br>we will be leaving time for questions at<br>the end and we recommend if you have<br>questions to jot those down and save<br>them and we will have time to answer<br>them<br>so we know that for any policy to be<br>relevant and effective<br>it must be positioned in alignment with<br>wider societal contexts and priorities<br>i'm focusing here on health workforce<br>and workforce representation<br>and the important societal<br>prioritization of health equity<br>in this context<br>health workforce representation or lack<br>of representation<br>is a major factor in contributing to<br>health equity or health inequity<br>we know from research that there is a<br>clear line of sight between the<br>configuration and distribution of the<br>health workforce<br>to achieving health equity<br>as shown in this diagram that comes from<br>nursing research we also know that there<br>are numerous benefits<br>to ensure a diverse and representative<br>workforce this includes benefits in<br>relation to communication with patients<br>in whanau<br>their trust in the health services<br>greater representation is also<br>associated with increased advocacy for<br>disadvantaged groups as well as an<br>overall impact on collegial learning and<br>influences<br>the link between health workforce and<br>equity health services access and health<br>inequity is reflected well in this news<br>article that came out just two weeks ago<br>the graphic image of people in northland<br>reporting having to remove their own<br>teeth with pliers<br>is deeply disturbing<br>it's concerning for a country who has<br>made a commitment to tariti or waitangi<br>to health equity<br>to rural health and to human rights<br>the inverse care law is clearly at play<br>in our society<br>we can clearly see a line of sight<br>between the health determinants<br>so i want to focus down on maori health<br>workforce and equity what we know is<br>that there is a pervasive and persistent<br>under-representation of maori across the<br>health workforce<br>however in particular this is very stark<br>in the parts of the health workforce<br>that we teach here at the university of<br>otago these figures speak for themselves<br>as only two to five percent of new<br>zealand's health workforce is maori for<br>many of the programs that we teach and<br>modeling based on a range of figures<br>indicates how many more maori would be<br>required for maori to make up 20 of the<br>workforce within different professions<br>and we have other modelling going on to<br>help us understand that for the other<br>professions not reported here<br>this shows we would need many many more<br>than we currently have to reach this<br>i've titled this part a tale of two<br>inequities<br>because in fact the challenge is<br>that in order to achieve health<br>workforce equity that then aligns with<br>health equity we must engage with<br>mitigate against and ultimately<br>transform educational inequity<br>and we need to do this as a major<br>educational institution<br>the graph on the left shows darkly the<br>different distribution of students<br>across school details of maori students<br>across school details on the basis of<br>ethnicity<br>we know that students who attend low<br>desal schools have a much lower rate of<br>attainment of university entrance when<br>we look at the graph on the right we see<br>this played out with roughly only a<br>quarter of maori and pacifica students<br>leaving school with university entrance<br>and blocking their pathways into<br>university joining the dots we come back<br>the graph on the right although based on<br>data from the medical council so<br>therefore focus on doctors is replicated<br>almost identically across all of the<br>health professional groups that we have<br>here at the university of otago<br>rectifying this<br>for all health professional programs is<br>some of the work and the challenge of<br>we thus come back full circle to the<br>policy itself<br>educational inequity is part of the<br>problem definition and foundation for<br>the policy it is also part of the<br>foundation for the pro-equity<br>educational programs we are running<br>across our division<br>i now hand over to peter and he will<br>continue with his talk about the policy<br>kiara<br>uh kia ora uh thank you joe how's volume<br>up at the back all good<br>great<br>um so i'm going to talk about the policy<br>itself the<br>rationale for the policy<br>the some of the key elements of the<br>policy<br>and then thirdly<br>uh some of the key<br>components relating to a successful<br>implementation<br>the rationale<br>and that's a quote from the politics<br>itself the purpose<br>of health professional education is to<br>produce a health workforce equipped to<br>meet the needs of society<br>so that's the why<br>underneath that<br>i'll mention four components of the<br>rationale and there are others<br>firstly<br>new zealand's unwritten<br>constitution<br>contains within it at its heart to<br>tiriti or waitangi<br>and that places obligations<br>on crown agencies such as universities<br>to deliver on article 1 article 2 and<br>article 3 of the treaty and they're all<br>relevant to this discussion about the<br>health workforce<br>so that's rationale number one it's a<br>constitutional rationale<br>rationale number two<br>relates to<br>international and to some extent local<br>evidence<br>which tells us<br>that students<br>who are drawn out of<br>to use the us language ethnic minority<br>communities<br>or australian evidence rural communities<br>when they graduate they're more likely<br>to return to work in those communities<br>that's what the evidence tells us<br>that is not a one-to-one deterministic<br>relationship but it's an on-balance<br>observation<br>so in the us for example if you come out<br>of ethnic minorities african-american<br>communities you're more likely to go<br>back and work in those communities<br>and we see some of that evidence<br>the third component of the rationale is<br>a very important one<br>and it relates to the substantive issue<br>of quality of care and health outcomes<br>and there's a number of strands to this<br>evidence<br>one of them relates directly to<br>patient carer concordance<br>and the quality of that experience for<br>the patient<br>and there's very strong parallels in<br>this discussion with gender we think<br>back to all the debates which were had<br>around gender<br>uh in medicine in particular<br>over the last 50 or 60 years we can<br>translate a lot of that<br>debate into the in the context of<br>the<br> society policy<br>another very important strand of that<br>evidence relates to what has become<br>politely known as unconscious bias aka<br>racism<br>and um<br>unconscious bias and the evidence<br>related to that drives inequitable<br>health outcomes in a way that no one<br>likes no one goes to work to achieve<br>that outcome<br>i've never met that person nevertheless<br>it's a feature of our system<br>and there's a lot of evidence related to<br>that<br>most recently the one i'm aware of was<br>in uh lance at public health two or<br>three weeks ago<br>a study spanning i forget 25 years i<br>think<br>of<br>long-term condition management in<br>auckland<br>and the<br>the the outcomes for people who are all<br>engaged in the system<br>maori pacific new zealand european<br>and the disparate outcomes for those<br>different population groups which are<br>highly meaningful in terms of health<br>status<br>the system did not seek to achieve those<br>disparate outcomes<br>but it did<br>and and we believe that the evidence<br>tells us if we populate the system from<br>the inside with different groups of<br>people we can help start addressing<br>unconscious bias<br>the fourth rationale there<br>speaks to a broader set of<br>considerations related to fairness the<br>sort of society we wish to live in<br>inclusion and participation<br>social cohesion and those sorts of<br>considerations<br>and again i would say by way of<br>a parallel<br>think back to<br>the profession of medicine as it was for<br>the first half of last century entirely<br>dominated by<br>uh<br>men<br>who claimed that they were serving the<br>needs of women perfectly adequately why<br>would any woman want to be a doctor even<br>if they were psychologically equipped to<br>so that's<br>now the policy itself<br>introduced in 2012<br>it applies to all nine health<br>professional programs within the<br>division of health sciences there are<br>health professional programs which<br>aren't in the division of health<br>sciences in the university of otago<br>this policy does not apply to them i'm<br>thinking clinical psychology<br>and dietetics although i think that<br>program's<br>on hold at the moment<br>there is a preoccupation with medicine<br>but the policy applies equally to all<br>health professional programs<br>it seeks to attract into those health<br>professional programs<br>to address the points that joe raised<br>students who are otherwise<br>under-represented or the demographics<br>in the in the health professional<br>programs themselves in the university<br>and more importantly in the workforce uh<br>needless to say we we seek to attract<br>through our affirmative pathways<br>students who have the academic ability<br>to succeed in those programs that's a<br>given<br>and we have thresholds for academic<br>achievement which need to be<br>met<br>and then underneath that we have five<br>affirmative pathways currently and two<br>of those the two at the bottom have more<br>recently been introduced<br>uh the maori affirmative pathway<br>which we'll be talking more on in a<br>moment zoe uh indigenous pacific and the<br>word indigenous there refers<br>specifically to<br>the the non-recent migrant populations<br>in the pacific and i said when i say<br>recent migrants for example<br>uh<br>chinese samoans or indian fijians<br>rural that is the one uh affirmative<br>pathway to was sort of mandated by<br>government although i think there's a uh<br>a lack of formal documentation around<br>that<br>uh currently um<br>uh<br>it recognizes the<br>uh<br>generalized different educate education<br>experience of<br>uh students who grow up and are educated<br>within rural communities<br>the socioeconomic category is one of the<br>new ones<br>and that along with uh the first two is<br>the most egregious<br>uh component of underrepresentation<br>of the student body<br>as a whole in our university and most<br>universities<br>and also the and within the health<br>professional programs and also more<br>substantively in the health workforce<br>and the final category of a refugee<br>background<br>students a much smaller category but we<br>recognize the need of those communities<br>to be served by people who have an<br>understanding of that<br>background and the system to be informed<br>by the expertise those people bring with<br>them<br>we do not cap those affirmative pathways<br>and we do not use the language of quotas<br>and and that's in contrast for example<br>with the university of auckland which<br>uses language of quotas we don't use<br>that language we have a slightly<br>and my last slide<br>is just some highlights<br>please come in and find a seat feel free<br>to<br>some of the key elements<br>which in our view contributed to<br>successful implementation<br>first of all none of this happened by<br>accident<br>so<br>long-term obsessive strategizing and<br>planning um<br>by many people<br>second on my list there<br>welcome<br>leadership<br>so none of this would have happened<br>without<br>extremely effective and skilled<br>maori leadership and pacific leadership<br>which has ensured the successful<br>implementation of the policies so the<br>policies sit there<br>to implement them we need effective<br>leadership<br>i put everyone there because there are<br>so many people who've had input one way<br>or another into the effective<br>implementation of these policies so it<br>is really it's something that we we<br>acknowledge everyone<br>and then uh the role i was in at the<br>time pvc<br>uh i i believed and i still do<br>that within that role<br>my job<br>was to create space around the<br>leadership table<br>for fully empowered and effective<br>and to support that leadership<br>so it was a enabling<br>role creating space empowering<br>the third point there is conceptual<br>it is impossible in my view to enter<br>this space<br>effectively and safely<br>without a sense of our history so<br>historical literacy<br>pre-colonial and colonial<br>it is very hard to engage in these<br>discussions without some element of<br>theorization<br>and i've identified there are a few<br>uh areas of theory which are to my mind<br>essential<br>uh theories and understanding of<br>indigeneity what does that mean<br>uh critical race theory<br>how does racism operate in settler<br>colonial societies<br>how is it manifest<br>i would argue very strongly that we are<br>a colonial society<br>and we are making our way towards some<br>condition in the future that we might<br>deem to call post-colonial we are not<br>meritocracy is a theoretical construct<br>from sociology which is used very<br>specifically in tertiary education it's<br>a whole universe of interesting material<br>on its own<br>and of course anti-racism theory okay<br>and i could go on theorizing<br>is so so important we go nowhere without<br>it<br>we have to understand the universe<br>around us through the lens of theory<br>we used in<br>our strengths relentlessly strength<br>space educational philosophy<br>students who come out of<br>communities who are traditionally<br>underrepresented in health professional<br>programs bring with them a range of<br>attributes and strengths that we place<br>very high value on<br>and of course this is all underpinned by<br>some investment i acknowledge the role<br>of the ministry of health<br>that has funded through contracts but<br>i'll tour thai for 10 years<br>and the maori health workforce<br>development unit and i acknowledge the<br>role of the university and strongly<br>supporting this work<br>over its entire duration<br>thank you very much and i hand over to<br>and um thank you john peter um can<br>everyone hear me okay<br>great and for the people watching from<br>home there is actually the capacity to<br>ask some questions in<br>um ask me a question in your zoom so<br>please feel free to um that's actually<br>my first time watching<br>the presentation i thought it was really<br>so yeah i'm going to talk about our mahi<br>and what we do so we are the maori<br>health workforce development unit and we<br>were established in partnership with the<br>ministry of health in 2010 with the goal<br>of increasing the maori health workforce<br>as joe's clearly highlighted health<br>workforce development has been a high<br>level priority for health professional<br>highly priority for new zealand for<br>decades and that's to meet unmet health<br>need<br>as peter highlighted the university of<br>otago has nine health professional<br>programs but we also have multiple<br>health science majors and we have a new<br>bachelor of health sciences degree<br>so actually the socio-demographic<br>composition of our graduates<br>plays a really important role in<br>increasing the diversity of the health<br>workforce and within that i'm also<br>talking about health researchers and<br>health scientists<br>for us as a team from the beginning<br>there was a very clear line of sight we<br>have a comprehensive strategy and we<br>have an achievable action plan to<br>achieve it<br>we fully understand our strategic vision<br>our why<br>and we also have a well-developed<br>understanding of the context so we<br>combined i guess<br>our strengths and health and expertise<br>and education together<br>we<br>we take a strength-based approach<br>approach and peter's covered that really<br>well maori values underpin every single<br>thing that we do and all of our programs<br>so we've actively worked to foster a<br>sense of whanau<br>in our team and with the students that<br>we have the privilege to work alongside<br>now you'll note here that there's also a<br>reference to deaf students from decile<br>one to three schools and that's a more<br>recent development<br>with the expansion of the marine society<br>policy and peter also spoke to that<br>briefly<br>so these are the programs that we have<br>been delivering we started in 2010<br>with the tukahika scholarship and some<br>outreach activity<br>so tsukahika is quite a unique<br>scholarship program and it provides<br>wrap-around support for selected<br>students<br>and it's about supporting them through<br>the university of otago's foundation<br>year so it's kind of a bridging year<br>between school and to university<br>the scholarship is unique in the fact<br>that it encompasses cultural financial<br>pastoral academic and social support<br>so we don't influence the curriculum we<br>influence what happens outside it and we<br>also include students whanau on the<br>journey because we know that they're a<br>massive driver to student success<br>all of our programs we will work very<br>closely with kamato<br>and i want to acknowledge the maori<br>center for being a fantastic hub of<br>student support here on campus<br>so we started in 2010 with tukayaka and<br>we knew we had to look ahead because we<br>wanted to support those students right<br>through to graduation and we were aware<br>that health sciences first year at the<br>time<br>outcomes for maori were not positive<br>so we looked at<br>where they were going and we developed<br>the bones of tsufaku-puawai which<br>literally means to make flourish<br>and we delivered it for the first time<br>in 2011. now for those of you that don't<br>know health sciences first year is the<br>first year of otago's health<br>professional programs and it's quite a<br>rigorous academic course so seven core<br>science papers students must pass all<br>the papers to a required criteria to<br>gain entry<br>again we knew we couldn't change the<br>curriculum and we couldn't also impact<br>the environment not just for the two<br>kahika students moving into house to<br>hsfy but also for the the other maori<br>students entering from all across new<br>zealand<br>but we could ensure that they had<br>accurate and timely information and<br>advice that they had culturally<br>responsive support<br>to go through together as a whanau<br>outcomes from the 2011 hsfy pilot were<br>overwhelmingly positive so<br>both academically and in terms of<br>student feedback<br>so from here we expanded the programs<br>that we deliver<br>we<br>started to grow<br>with the growing numbers of maori going<br>into health professional programs we<br>also needed to ensure that there was<br>that seamless support right through<br>and for students who weren't going<br>directly into health professional<br>programs or who wanted to pursue health<br>science majors and degrees they needed<br>accurate advice as well so it was just<br>extending that pipeline also into the<br>compulsory sector so really vamping up<br>our outreach and our recruitment<br>programs there<br>research and evaluation underpins<br>everything that we do so our process has<br>been that we gather evidence to design<br>what we do and we do it in a<br>strength-based way only and then we<br>design we deliver we evaluate and then<br>we quality improve and i can see some<br>aero people in the room so hopefully<br>that's uh<br>so in the same time that we were<br>piloting<br>the hsfy program<br>peter came on board as the pro vice<br>chancellor for the division<br>so what we had was our partnership with<br>the ministry of health so we were funded<br>we had joe's leadership and you know a<br>very clear maori centered approach we<br>had peter's leadership in the division<br>and then the mirror on society policy so<br>we had all the mechanisms to really<br>thrive as a team and also you know as<br>with our programs and we were able to<br>expand our team at the same time frame<br>as well but initially it was just joe<br>and i um<br>you know working across<br>the space<br>so<br>here you can see uh an overview of the<br>number of maori and health professional<br>programs over time<br>so you can see the key intervention<br>point there in 2011 prior to 2011 the<br>the number of maori entering into health<br>professional programs across all eight<br>programs so i'm excluding nursing here<br>was minimal so eight to ten students per<br>annum and you can see by that logic we<br>would never reach our health workforce<br>goals<br>and then what you can also see is that<br>marked increase so from 2011 straight<br>from healthsci then we start to support<br>students on graduate pathways we're<br>working with our communities and it just<br>blossoms so currently we're sitting<br>about 14 of the total proportion of<br>domestic students across all eight<br>so reflecting on the past 10 years<br>we have got a lot to celebrate actually<br>and it's worth celebrating<br>in 2016 we saw the largest<br>number of maori doctors in new zealand<br>history graduate from our university<br>and that's how long it took by the way<br>in 2018 we saw the largest cohort of<br>maori health professionals graduate and<br>within that the largest cohort of maori<br>dentists<br>in 2019 we were able to deliver the<br>pilot for the socio-economic equity<br>project which is a sister project to<br>what we do and it's specifically<br>targeted for students from deci one to<br>three schools of who i can see a couple<br>in the room as well<br>now um outcomes for the eq project<br>mirror those from the other mhwdu<br>programs so yes these outcomes are<br>outstanding you know we can celebrate<br>and they have made a contribution to the<br>new zealand health workforce however<br>we still have a ways to go<br>that largest cohort of maori doctors in<br>2016 went into a workforce at point zero<br>nine<br>zero zero nine percent of the workforce<br>so i'll say that again 0.09 percent of<br>the workforce<br>our largest number of dental graduates<br>did not meaningfully shift the<br>proportion of maori dentists in new<br>zealand so that's still at three just<br>and i think this is quite concerning in<br>our country across all of our<br>professions so that let's include law<br>chartered accountants only one percent<br>of professionals come from a decile one<br>school<br>one percent<br>so what we do know what the past decade<br>has taught us is that<br>these inequities can be addressed<br>and that maori and equity focus programs<br>absolutely have the capacity to<br>transform educational outcomes the<br>health workforce and<br>eventually health outcomes for those who<br>most need it<br>we know that maori strategies and<br>pedagogies work<br>and that they also work for non-maori<br>and that's evidenced by the eq project<br>the persistent gap in educational<br>attainment between maori and non-maori<br>and those from lower dissolved schools<br>and those from higher decision schools<br>can be narrowed and i think eventually<br>eliminated<br>so critical success factors<br>just quickly i think we've covered them<br>all you know<br>having maori leadership matters having<br>a clear strategy and a line of sight<br>knowing what we're going to do and how<br>we're going to do it matters<br>evidence informed practice<br>has worked and we're constantly tweaking<br>what we do because it's constantly<br>evolving the strength-based approach is<br>essential for natanga underpins<br>everything<br>we also have a committed team who i want<br>to acknowledge we work with amazingly<br>passionate people who<br>give up their time consistently to make<br>sure<br>that the young people that we work with<br>are getting the most positive outcomes<br>and most importantly before i get very<br>emotional<br>outstanding<br>students um yeah<br>i'm going to leave it at that killer<br>so these are the fabulous people i get<br>to<br>work with every day and i before i go on<br>to<br>wrap up before our question<br>i really do want to<br>acknowledge peter for his<br>superb and outstanding leadership<br>to drive through the mirror on society<br>policy<br>which was aware that we already had some<br>things going on but really wrapped<br>around<br>the opportunity to seal this going<br>forward into the future but to align<br>that policy with the aspirations and not<br>just maori communities but pacific<br>communities<br>low income whanau and communities and<br>the very um diverse<br>people that we want reflected in the<br>health workforce so huge acknowledgement<br>to you peter and to zoe who's been<br>walking on this journey and um is<br>an amazing uh who brings an amazing<br>knowledge and passion for education into<br>the space<br>and again our experience<br>is that<br>we are aware that although the outcome<br>may be in health<br>the skills to achieve that outcome have<br>very much been coming out of people with<br>educational expertise and i greatly<br>acknowledge you zoe and the incredible<br>team that is the maori health workforce<br>development unit and everyone who sits<br>around our team<br>so as we reflect on our 10-year journey<br>we have a number of key learnings<br>in particular<br>we've learnt there is a fundamental and<br>critical need to embed the understanding<br>of the why<br>into<br>all people involved in health<br>professional training and selection<br>and embrace opportunities for meaningful<br>partnerships with our diverse<br>students whanau and communities<br>we pract very practically<br>we recognise the importance of carefully<br>constructed policy<br>and programs evidence-informed<br>culturally responsive approaches to<br>education and health workforce equity<br>these lead to benefits across health and<br>education<br>across our health professional programs<br>they greatly enhance the manner of our<br>institution and the contribution that<br>the institution is able to make<br>and they also greatly enhance our<br>opportunity to make the kind of<br>differences we want to with the students<br>their whanau in our communities<br>our final reflection is also our huge<br>thanks and acknowledgement<br>for the work of so many<br>many people have journeyed with us<br>as we have navigated our waka towards<br>health workforce equity and this is<br>across the division the university our<br>communities and organizations<br>this journey is one that has taken many<br>right<br>um<br>a<br>box you can throw around but we can also<br>um<br>take part i from home<br>and here just to while we're<br>if anyone's got any questions please<br>just pop your hand up and we'll um<br>throw the box in your direction and if<br>you're not confident at catching or<br>throwing uh we can bring it to you<br>you'll<br>probably hey um congratulations that's a<br>great presentation thank you<br>um a couple a couple of comments um i've<br>had the privilege over the last year to<br>read the essays of quite a few students<br>as they go through the first year after<br>graduation<br>and i i can't stress the importance<br>i think you've stressed that i'll just<br>stress it again the importance of that<br>connection with your community and i've<br>read the stories and heard the<br>reflections of of the first year<br>postgraduate that very much reinforced<br>the messages that you're given<br>and the second point i want to make is<br>around covert<br>i think there are some lessons from<br>covert which you might just want to<br>expand a wee bit about what what what<br>what we've seen happen in the last year<br>which has been a really stressful<br>difficult year for many many people<br>uh the the importance of uh the support<br>that i've seen occur in the indigenous<br>communities with their families and<br>extended whanau<br>has been<br>i think something that we've all learned<br>from but you might want to comment on<br>and thank you for your comment<br>in terms of covet i'm on the maori<br>advisory to the<br>the directorate the maori directorate<br>over the response to kovard and i think<br>what we have all seen is<br>the strength this is a strengths-based<br>approach that has been taken by maori<br>communities pacifica communities<br>to the challenges of covert<br>very quickly drawing on those community<br>strengths and relationships to mobilize<br>to support kaimatua to<br>provide information and to really get<br>into communities where<br>people and organizations who don't have<br>those relationships were unable to be as<br>effective so i think it's really brought<br>in to start<br>highlight the role and value<br>of that diversity in the health sector<br>at all levels and the embracing of<br>our own kaupapa maori services as part<br>um<br>i'll try and keep to that word briefly<br>just to um acknowledge uh the work that<br>you do i've been really lucky since i<br>started here<br>um and privileged to work alongside and<br>with you<br>um and<br>in the mahi that we do for<br>for everybody really i think<br>peter hit it on the head about<br>leadership and<br>for maori to enjoy success as maori and<br>being allowed<br>allowed to<br>lead as maori with the the core values<br>that you have<br>um in your team<br>so um i'm really privileged to be um<br>part of your journey um gosh it's been<br>like 10 years zoe and i<br>think i remember all those school visits<br>we went on and all those sorts of things<br>so um so i just want to um congratulate<br>um you and the whole team for the<br>outstanding work that you do and i know<br>um would have been neglectful of me not<br>to say anything since auntie pearl's not<br>here<br>so um so yes<br>um<br>a fabulous asset the jewel and the crown<br>of maori students support here at otago<br>so name frank um i see the question box<br>up in the row there<br>tiena koto tina koto katoa nissan<br>bulovanaka don't forget there's all the<br>pacifica people here my name's nick<br>giblin i'm a gp here in dunedin i'm<br>proud to say i was part of the mirror on<br>society selection policy<br>in about<br>1981 so it's a long time ago<br>i'm also chair of pacific air to<br>pacifica which is a pacific health<br>provider in christchurch can i just pass<br>on on behalf of the pacifica people of<br>christchurch<br>thanks to the university of otago for<br>maintaining<br>the miran society policy and um i also<br>like to say thank you and<br>just remind people that this policy was<br>that threat legal threat recently<br>and<br>thank you for keeping it going<br>the question i have is uh that<br>moving forward the university had stated<br>that it would liaise more with the<br>the communities with the families with<br>i would really like to ask<br>how that is going to happen<br>we have very much have a policy in<br>pacifica that<br>that everything we do is family-led uh<br>is led by the people so i'm hoping<br>you'll be able to answer how can we<br>continue to proceed with that<br>i think we can answer quite positively<br>on that so we're having lots of um<br>discussions<br>now about how to to<br>um get the next steps and do it really<br>well<br>you know so we've we've been on this<br>10-year journey uh we're at a point<br>where<br>the the next steps do matter because we<br>know we can do something so<br>there is a plan for active consultation<br>um and actually i think the first it<br>will be consultation with the right<br>people around the table to then decide<br>who else from those communities need to<br>be<br>have accorded or with so<br>i yeah i don't know if you want to add<br>more to that joe<br>yeah so i think<br>the message has been heard very clearly<br>that<br>moving forward<br>this is an issue that so that our whole<br>society has a stake in and particular<br>communities have<br>a very strong skin in this game<br>and so i'm convinced that there is a<br>commitment<br>to<br>meaningful consultation to make sure<br>that moving forward we not only<br>um move forward in a um in a minimal way<br>but we actually have the capacity to<br>move forward with appropriate<br>consultation in a really aspirational<br>way what does the next 10 years look<br>like and i know our pacifica whanau who<br>are across the corridor from us and us<br>are seeing this as a good faith offer<br>from our institution to meaningfully<br>consult how that happens uh we will be<br>seeing over the next wee while but i i<br>thank you so much i've got a couple of<br>questions and<br>quickly<br>the first one is kind of i hear often<br>said that or closer<br>that maori have the opportunity to<br>return to their communities and serve<br>their communities by encouraging that do<br>we risk stratifying race throughout<br>different specialties at like and kind<br>of having public health and gp dominated<br>by<br>racial minorities but some of the other<br>specialties kind of lacking still and<br>then kind of along the same lines of<br>like once we do have a kind of mirrored<br>society through those kind of health<br>professions<br>how do we know we've made it because i<br>feel like if this year's taught us<br>anything it's that there are a few<br>people who are higher up who are quite<br>nostalgic for the colorblind kind of<br>policies of the past and<br>you know a bit trigger-happy so what's<br>to stop kind of them going well we've<br>made it let's let's cap it or let's<br>remove it and and then<br>those kind of changes aren't propagated<br>throughout the next few generations<br>i don't know yeah how do we know we've<br>yes<br>that's a big question and i and i might<br>just<br>toss out two particular responses and<br>noting there will be<br>many more<br>uh firstly i think you correctly point<br>out that it's a journey<br>and the end point of that journey is<br>not necessarily that well defined<br>i would anchor that endpoint in health<br>equity<br>that's one of our really substantive<br>goals here<br>i like to think about it like this<br>that whatever the touch point with the<br>health system<br>and this speaks your comment about all<br>specialties and areas of healthcare<br>whatever the touch point<br>then you have a reasonable chance<br>with that touch point of interacting<br>with<br>a diversity of health professionals be<br>they nurses<br>oral health professionals radiation<br>therapists physiotherapists whatever it<br>is<br>and that includes maori and pacific<br>health professionals<br>so that the feeling that you get from<br>interacting with the health system as it<br>and i hopefully we will know<br>when we're sort of achieving that but<br>it's not a particularly clearly<br>uh the other component of my answer to<br>we welcome in<br>to our programs<br>our diversity of<br>students or at least students from a<br>diversity of backgrounds<br>because<br>we feel<br>we're changing the system from the<br>inside<br>and we get this feedback all the time<br>from district health boards general<br>practices<br>wherever it may be whatever part of the<br>health system<br>that<br>enrich and inform and educate and<br>influence by virtue of being in the<br>health workforce<br>and we see that very much in our health<br>professional classes they are different<br>from the way they used to be<br>very<br>substantially it's very hard to measure<br>that but we see it and and lots of<br>people talk about it and we get lots of<br>positive feedback from<br>the system<br>saying you're doing a great job please<br>do more of it<br>this is what we've always wanted and we<br>haven't quite known that to the extent<br>that we know it now that we've got it<br>i don't know if that makes sense but<br>there are two small answers to a very<br>um i have a couple of questions for for<br>probably<br>for both of you<br>um<br>first is what's your thoughts around<br>marine society as a<br>wider university<br>policy rather than it being a<br>health science policy so it's the first<br>one the second one what's your thoughts<br>around<br>instead of first year health science<br>doing a science degree and so that<br>students don't get to first year health<br>say and then don't make it and has a<br>huge impact on them<br>you know what happens after that is any<br>so in terms of the mirror on society<br>across the university i know that<br>actually many programs that are trying<br>to<br>make a difference for the constituency<br>of the people in their programs are<br>grappling with this so i know the law<br>school<br>is putting a lot of thought into things<br>so<br>i think there is a real interest<br>and desire<br>to engage with this issue of equity<br>educational equity and pathways right<br>across the university and i certainly<br>see<br>some real opportunities across the<br>yeah i i mean actually i'd state that<br>even more strongly there's nothing<br>particular about health science programs<br>which<br>mirror on society type approach more<br>important there that<br>then it is in humanities<br>or sciences<br>uh or education or anywhere else<br>um it's it's just this has been the<br>focus of uh the mirror on society policy<br>thus far<br>i would be strongly advocating for the<br>policy being applied much more broadly<br>for all the same reasons and that is as<br>a tertiary institution if we are going<br>to be serving the needs of our<br>communities our diverse communities then<br>we need to be engaging with them<br>embracing them drawing them into our<br>institution the next 50 physicists<br>coming out of otago should be maori and<br>pacific<br>right that won't happen not not this<br>year anyway but but why not<br>and look i can tell you uh the maori<br>word i i'm a beginner learner of the<br>maori language the word for<br>time is wah<br>the term for space is war<br>uh so uh it took einstein's work out in<br>the western culture that there was a<br>space-time<br>continuum<br>but it's embedded in in that world view<br>in the maori in the pacific world view<br>uh i just note the point that<br>we can enrich these<br>uh<br>all areas of university life and life in<br>our country<br>by engaging properly with our diverse<br>communities so that they are embraced<br>with our institutions<br>uh on your second point losser<br>actually that is a big discussion all on<br>its own should we have graduate entry<br>health programs lots of<br>parts of the world do do that<br>we do do it to some extent there are<br>pros and cons and one can debate that<br>issue backwards and forwards<br>a great deal and it's probably more of<br>an offline discussion because it's a big<br>one<br>okay<br>so uh thank you and i'll try and repeat<br>back that question so everyone hears it<br>it was the health sciences first year<br>is a very intense year i think you said<br>and maybe educationally speaking there<br>might be other ways of achieving some of<br>those objectives in a way which might be<br>uh slightly more and fulsome and and<br>maybe<br>uh more enjoyable for students was that<br>your question<br>yeah i think so<br>and look<br>there's been a few headlines<br>uh this week<br>on um<br>uh<br>balloting systems<br>uh or lotteries as the headline was and<br>i've apologized to rathan and thank you<br>for attending today<br>for springing that on him it was<br>actually a comment i made as a complete<br>aside to a reporter who was talking<br>about the issue you've raised<br>about intensity of competition and i<br>said well there are ways of considering<br>uh<br>different approaches one of which is a<br>balloting system which has been tried<br>elsewhere in the world and that also has<br>a set of pros and cons might we consider<br>that but there are other options as well<br>selection into competitive programs<br>whatever that program might be is a is<br>endlessly difficult we actually do not<br>have the perfect tools so we use a range<br>of tools none of which on its own is<br>ideal we put them together and we do our<br>best and that comment applies for the<br>entire globe<br>but the point you raise is a very good<br>one<br>good luck<br>oh wow<br>um so<br>kia ora um it's not really a question<br>but probably more of as a comment um<br>before i go any further my name's ellie<br>i'm uh i have a couple of conflicts of<br>interest firstly being i'm joe's<br>extremely proud daughter<br>um<br>but also i am a<br>trainee intern from the university of<br>otago wellington and i've been a<br>representative of students for many<br>years this year being the president of<br>the new zealand medical students<br>association which i've now passed on to<br>anu who's worked around really well with<br>um<br>all the marijuana society stuff anyway<br>what<br>i really wanted to say<br>um being a ti who's finishing<br>today<br>um i can quite confidently say that a<br>degree at otago is not just a degree in<br>medicine it's a degree in maori health<br>i have<br>had<br>so many placements um<br>so i'm getting a little bit emotional um<br>this year alone<br>the communities that i've worked with<br>have been so strongly maori and so for<br>example i've been<br>doing gp in like rural tied after t up<br>in gizzy i've done gp at auditor takua<br>here in porirua<br>i was a training intern at wanganui<br>hospital which is a very strong maori<br>population<br>and at times well most of the time i was<br>by far the only kiwi trained student<br>doctor on the team um there was no new<br>zealanders anywhere let alone maori so<br>what<br>these have taught me is that there's so<br>much strength<br>and bringing an understanding of taganga<br>maori but also being maori in that space<br>and<br>what i don't think<br>well what my question might be is<br>whether you guys think that we<br>currently<br>um capture that strength in regards to<br>recognizing it for admissions but also<br>throughout<br>medical school and whether you think<br>that there's room to<br>better<br>recognize<br>the strengths and the skills that come<br>along with being maori but also being<br>having an understanding of being maori<br>um<br>i think our aspiration uh you know this<br>is why we keep using the term journey<br>as i think back about the journey that<br>we've been on from the<br>12 or 15 students being maori in the<br>medical school class<br>to 67 maori students in this second year<br>class<br>and what we have seen i think very much<br>has been the shifting and changing of<br>the whole class<br>in relation to the presence of those<br>maori students and again acknowledging<br>our pacifica whanau<br>we've seen other growth and so<br>the expectations from students not just<br>maori and pacifica students but from all<br>students about engaging with things<br>maori has just gone<br>through the roof um for all the right<br>reasons<br>so our vision<br>as a division and as a school<br>is that we can identify what your<br>aspirations are<br>and actually look at those opportunities<br>in rural places and spaces<br>and dhvs and i suppose if i laid my<br>cards on the table<br>i would love to see the opportunity for<br>the equivalent of the rural immersion<br>program but a maori immersion program<br>where people get to really focus down<br>on what it means to work in things maori<br>and that every<br>student whatever health professional<br>program they're in has that experience<br>so<br>it is in the vision<br>all pressure applied from external is<br>much appreciated<br>well cured everyone i realize that there<br>may still be more questions um feel free<br>to contact us by email or<br>other forms if you have further<br>questions i want to really really think<br>and acknowledge<br>my co-speakers today two of the most<br>awesome people i know<br>our fabulous whanau who are doing this<br>mahi every day and also all of you for<br>coming along and<br>listening to this korero we feel very<br>passionate about it we think it is a way<br>that we can all not just um have a have<br>a uh<br>an experience of doing something good<br>but it is transformative in both health<br>and education so something that we all<br>aspire to<br>so i wonder if we just finish up with a<br>karakia pierre just quickly before we do<br>i would like to finish up what i was<br>supposed to say which was i want to<br>mayhe to the students our outstanding<br>students who have the privilege to work<br>with who show exemplary leadership<br>who go above and beyond to support<br>students coming through<br>we can't do this work without you we're<br>all everyone<br>maori non-maori all on this journey and<br>we appreciate you so so much<br>and yeah kyota<br>okay<br>i<br>tell us who you<br>are<br>oh</p></main><footer
