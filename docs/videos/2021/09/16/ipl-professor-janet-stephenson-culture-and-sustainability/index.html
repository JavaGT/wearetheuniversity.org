Janet is a social scientist whose work focuses on societal transitions to a sustainable future. She considers that complex sustainability challenges require the integration of multiple forms of knowledge and expertise, and for this reason most of her work is with multidisciplinary and/or multicultural teams. Her research seeks to deliver insights and solutions through collaborations with end-users such as communities, iwi organisations, councils, businesses and government agencies.<br><br>She has led several major research projects in Aotearoa relating to energy, mobility and climate change, and has longstanding research collaborations in Norway. Janet has led the development of the cultures framework, a novel theoretical approach to investigating societal change, which has been widely adopted around the world. For the past 10 years Janet has been Director of the Centre for Sustainability, an interdisciplinary research centre which hosts many externally funded research programmes, staff and postgraduate students. She serves in an advisory capacity for a variety of programmes and organisations within Aotearoa and internationally.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

chancellor<br>professor helen nicholson has the<br>pleasure of welcoming you here tonight<br>welcome to colleagues<br>visitors and members of the dunedin<br>community here in person and online i<br>understand<br>uh to this very very special occasion<br>for the university where we come<br>together to celebrate the promotion of<br>professor janet stevenson to that<br>position<br>which is our highest academic position<br>and here's something of the mahi that<br>has made this happen through her<br>inaugural professorial lecture<br>this is a celebration and it's great to<br>see so many distinguished visitors and<br>members members of professor stevenson's<br>fun are here tonight uh our chancellor<br>professor dr royden sommerville welcome<br>and thank you for coming tonight<br>to janet's husband guy two of your<br>your granddaughter etta you're looking<br>beautiful tonight in the front row<br>and to your sister brother and niece<br>joining us here in person and many<br>others online know my haramai welcome on<br>behalf of university before i begin<br>further proceedings um probably a public<br>service announcement given the news<br>given the news that many of you will<br>have heard tonight<br>um we<br>will be um hearing news from government<br>um probably<br>at the end of this lecture<br>um but uh currently we are under a level<br>one but that does mean that we have to<br>take uh public health precautions<br>seriously so that for those of you in<br>the university community if you've got<br>your phone or my mobile device on uh<br>note and remember that you will<br>contact tracing if required will go<br>through the the wi-fi network for those<br>who are visitors to the university we<br>hope you uh scanned or signed in signed<br>in on your way into the lecture theater<br>tonight if you<br>did not do that please do that on your<br>way out tonight<br>and as<br>as<br>current status permits we will be<br>gathering for<br>fellowship in the staff club afterwards<br>but also please<br>please follow those normal practices and<br>of course if there is an alert level<br>change we will recognize that and<br>adapt our plans accordingly<br>to that<br>also for this special occasion please<br>ensure your cell phones are switched off<br>or too silent we recognize it's probably<br>not the best thing to ask you to<br>everyone to switch their phones off if<br>there is a uh a public service<br>announcement we just have to be prepared<br>to be interrupted for a short time<br>during that but i think that will likely<br>come at the end of<br>professor stevenson's lecture<br>okay so that's the public service<br>announcement out of the way<br>this is a special occasion and one where<br>we reflect as well as in celebration on<br>professor stevenson's achievements on<br>the important contributions we make as a<br>university through our professoria<br>through our wider faculty our students<br>professional staff and alumni networks<br>you will hear tonight of the important<br>work professor stevenson has led over<br>many years in developing a cultures<br>framework for understanding behaviors<br>and drivers of behavior changes in<br>energy use transport and any many other<br>areas of sustainability<br>work that will be vital as part of our<br>response to the grand challenges of<br>climate change sustainability and<br>biodiversity<br>that we faced together as a human race<br>understanding of<br>understanding the drivers of culture<br>change is critical because as many of us<br>in leadership positions regularly<br>regularly reflect<br>um culture each strategy for breakfast<br>um not that a good long-term strategy is<br>not vital chancellor<br>now professor now will introduce<br>professor stevenson and her talk in more<br>detail but i want to emphasize first the<br>significance of her promotion to full<br>professor in our university system and<br>the rigor that is involved in that<br>process<br>we set very high standards here at the<br>university of otago and for a research<br>professor like janet<br>we require evidence of sustained<br>excellence and leadership in both<br>research and service<br>we measure this based on the<br>expectations of the best universities in<br>rtrr and the rest of the world and the<br>views of a number of global experts are<br>sought as referees in the process no<br>fewer than five in your case i i see<br>from the file at janet uh all who i'm<br>happy to say<br>strongly recommended you in this<br>well-deserved promotion<br>clear from these referee reports janet<br>was a view that we all hold about your<br>efforts namely that you haven't<br>undertaken seminal work<br>through which you hold exceptional<br>influence amongst sustainability<br>researchers i'm quoting here from some<br>of the comments and your referees<br>reports<br>that your work offers fresh alternatives<br>to transitioning to a low carbon energy<br>systems and is increasingly referred to<br>in solutions oriented approaches to<br>sustainability<br>and that your service and leadership has<br>been exemplary with many outstanding<br>examples cited within the university<br>within national collaborative networks<br>such as the sustainable seas national<br>science challenges<br>within governance of national biology<br>bodies such as neri the national energy<br>research institute<br>and with it in contributions to the<br>global sustainability research community<br>i can't end by also<br>uh noting<br>that you care deeply about people and<br>what you do evidence through the success<br>of your students in the warm and<br>welcoming culture and environment in the<br>center for sustainability<br>so enough said from me i think professor<br>now will say more in that but i want to<br>personally thank you for your efforts<br>and the work that is to come and on<br>behalf of the university congratulate<br>you on your well-earned promotion<br>so i now invite professor now head of<br>the school of geography to formally<br>introduce you and the topic of your<br>it's a pleasure to be here this evening<br>and it's a delight to introduce you to<br>professor janet stevenson who's based at<br>the center for sustainability in the<br>school of geography janet has had a<br>fascinating career and it's my pleasure<br>to be able to talk very briefly about<br>that career and some of the key things<br>which have happened to bring her to the<br>position where we're so delighted to<br>celebrate her promotion this evening<br>janet's work is at the cutting edge of<br>community engaged science with a<br>specific focus on how we as a collective<br>humanity engage with the daunting<br>environmental and sustainability<br>challenges which the world is<br>experiencing<br>challenges which were once again<br>reminded of in the release last week of<br>the latest ipcc report<br>as janet's work over many years has<br>shown to effect change scientific<br>knowledge needs to be synthesized with<br>community insights values and indigenous<br>knowledge<br>drawing on culture to engage in the<br>process of proactive change<br>janet's understanding and appreciation<br>of the need to interface environmental<br>and community issues started very young<br>at the age of two she moved with a<br>family from the uk to a farm in new<br>zealand's north island here through both<br>the influence of her father who was an<br>early pioneer<br>in the field of sustainable farming<br>practice and her engagement with local<br>maori community a lifelong interest in<br>culture and environment developed<br>as a young researcher starting off in<br>her career she describes herself as a<br>barefoot researcher that's an evocative<br>term which enjoyed widespread currency<br>in the 1970s and 1980s which describes<br>researchers who left their offices and<br>laboratories<br>and as stan berkey describes when to<br>learn from and with the people most<br>impacted by decisions made in offices<br>distant to their life worlds i think<br>that's certainly a characteristic of<br>janet's career over her over many<br>decades<br>thereafter followed her move to the<br>hokianga with her future husband guy<br>where she worked as a researcher a<br>consultant and for the local district<br>council<br>it was there that she undertook her<br>master's research which examined<br>resource management on maori land<br>the family moved to dunedin in 1999<br>where she held several research and<br>lecturing positions and undertook her<br>phd on cultural values before moving to<br>work at what is now the center for<br>sustainability<br>her phd work has been widely recognized<br>and adopted internationally<br>its key theoretical contribution was in<br>terms of the links it made between<br>society behaviour and sustainability<br>outcomes<br>her 13 years at the center most of them<br>as its director<br>saw her player skills and talents to<br>both growing the center but also<br>focusing its activities on issues as<br>diverse as energy development local<br>transport smart grids community<br>engagement with sea level rise<br>decarbonization and maori community<br>responses to climate change<br>janet's success as an academic is<br>remarkable<br>between 2017 and 2020<br>she raised over 13 million dollars in<br>research funds and she has led five<br>major and 32 other funded projects<br>across her career she has published over<br>130 peer-reviewed publications<br>key achievements include chairing the<br>national energy research institute being<br>the new zealand university's<br>representative on the ministry of<br>transports research governance committee<br>and her collaboration with the dunedin<br>city council over many years<br>at the university she has made<br>significant contributions to the<br>university's sustainability initiatives<br>the maori strategic framework and she<br>has actively supported maori research<br>as we shall hear shortly janet's work<br>which is also the focus of the book she<br>is presently writing<br>seeks to bring together cultural theory<br>indigenous knowledge<br>policy interdisciplinary research and<br>sustainability thinking<br>this work is critical both in new<br>zealand and at a wider level in terms of<br>its concept of its engagement to the<br>concept of well-beings a framework which<br>influences both local government and<br>budgetary planning in new zealand and in<br>other countries<br>as such this work adds to and extends<br>earlier understandings around<br>sustainable livelihoods approaches<br>these approaches while acknowledging the<br>value of social and human capital have<br>more recently taken on board the<br>importance of culture which is a at the<br>heart of janet's presentation tonight<br>with these words i now have the pleasure<br>of inviting professor janet stevenson to<br>present her inaugural professorial<br>lecture which is entitled culture and<br>sustainability thank you janet<br>chancellor deputy vice chancellors pro<br>vice chancellor and professor etienne<br>now<br>um<br>firstly i greet the leaders of this<br>university and secondly warm greetings<br>to the home people of kai tahu at otako<br>poketaraki and moiraki who host us on<br>their ancestral land<br>and special greetings to all of you in<br>the audience<br>my family<br>my friends<br>my colleagues and students from the<br>centre for sustainability and elsewhere<br>across the university<br>sustainability activists people from<br>dunedin businesses and organizations and<br>those of you who are listening in by<br>zoom<br>i'm honored to have you here<br>many of you have inspired supported and<br>i want to start though with the most<br>critical issue facing humanity as a<br>whole<br>that is the destabilization and<br>destruction at local and global scales<br>of the natural systems on which life and<br>well-being depend<br>and the injustices that flow from this<br>because these impacts will be<br>experienced most harshly by those who<br>are less advantaged<br>those younger generations and those who<br>are not yet born<br>this is an existential crisis<br>the evidence is clear this harm will<br>become locked into our future unless we<br>act immediately and collectively<br>and taking climate change is just one of<br>those destabilizers last week we saw the<br>release of the ipcc sixth assessment<br>report on the physical science of<br>climate change<br>despite three decades of global<br>political commitments greenhouse gas<br>emissions have continued to rise<br>unless transformative change is achieved<br>within a few years the world will be<br>more than 1.5 degrees warmer than<br>pre-industrial times by 2040 and<br>possibly sooner by the mid-2030s<br>we are then in increasingly devastating<br>territory with liking likely tipping<br>points into even worse climate extremes<br>we either have to make rapid and radical<br>changes to how we live or radical<br>changes will be forced upon us by an<br>unravelling planet<br>we have a very short window for<br>individual and collective action<br>not just to maintain and restore<br>environmental systems but to do this<br>while addressing current and future<br>inequalities ensuring health and<br>well-being and developing sustainable<br>livelihoods and resilient communities<br>but this sustainability transition as is<br>commonly called is hugely challenging it<br>involves the adoption of different<br>behaviours and technologies<br>but more than this it involves the<br>transformation of systems of production<br>and consumption<br>it requires major adjustments in<br>governance and how people and<br>organizations think and act and the<br>beliefs and ideologies that impel them<br>in other words it involves cultural<br>change<br>so my talk tonight is about culture and<br>sustainability<br>sustainability because it is the most<br>critical issue facing humanity<br>culture because it is fundamentally the<br>cause of the sustainability crisis<br>culture because it can lock us into<br>business as usual and culture because it<br>is potentially a powerful<br>being here tonight is an absolute<br>privilege<br>and unexpected because my pathway here<br>has been somewhat unorthodox<br>i remember when i was awarded my phd in<br>2005 thinking that it doesn't get much<br>better than this<br>but the last 16 years have been an<br>extraordinary time of intellectual<br>challenge personal growth and inspiring<br>collaborations with others both inside<br>and outside of the university and many<br>of you in this room<br>one of the most important things i've<br>learned is the power of ideas<br>tonight i'm going to tell you the story<br>of an idea that grew from a seemingly<br>small insight to become a theoretical<br>framework that is widely used<br>internationally and applied to an<br>extraordinary<br>broad array of topics<br>i love to talk about it because it helps<br>me make me make sense of the world and<br>because it gives me hope<br>but first i'm going to tell you a little<br>bit about how i got here and how my<br>pre-academic life has shaped my work as<br>an academic because even though<br>universities are places of learning<br>there are many things that one can only<br>learn by living and experiencing<br>and for me those learnings are<br>intimately linked with the places that<br>my mihi links me to south waikato where<br>i spent most of my formative years and<br>where our family still farms but i was<br>actually born in cambridge england and<br>came to aotearoa new zealand when i was<br>two years old<br>our parents worked on several farms<br>before buying mortgage to the hilt our<br>farm at tiwatu when i was eight<br>that's me in the left of both of the<br>photos<br>our father enabled by our<br>extraordinarily supportive mother<br>combined a love for farming with a<br>passion for the environment<br>he led the establishment of many<br>groundbreaking national initiatives such<br>as the qe2 national trust which enables<br>farmers to voluntarily protect their<br>land in perpetuity<br>and the farm environment awards which<br>which recognize new zealand's leading<br>farmers in sustainable land management<br>what i learned from him could be the<br>topic of the rest of this lecture but<br>the one thing i want to highlight here<br>was his genius for recognizing what i<br>call the gleam of the possible<br>farmers aren't usually perceived as<br>being environmentally concerned<br>but he saw under the rhetoric to the<br>real affinity and concern that many of<br>them had for the land<br>through much discussion and i will<br>remember those endless committee<br>meetings he used to go to<br>he brought farmers together to work with<br>local government councils and others on<br>a whole raft of environmental projects<br>locally and nationally most of which are<br>still going strong<br>his energy and vision still sustain me<br>in the photo he's being awarded his<br>honorary doctorate from waikato<br>after leaving home and this is me and my<br>brother and sister who are both here in<br>after leaving home my undergraduate<br>studies were a multi-disciplinary<br>smorgasbord i started at massey in<br>palmerston north and somehow the<br>long-suffering university of auckland<br>let me graduate in the end with a ba in<br>sociology<br>but in between i recall papers in<br>biology chemistry statistics economics<br>psychology social work anthropology and<br>sociology and probably more<br>i think this was the beginning of my<br>fascination with interdisciplinary<br>approaches<br>alongside my studies i was heavily<br>involved in community work or what might<br>be called community activism<br>working part-time alongside my studies<br>with disadvantaged communities in<br>palmerston north and auckland<br>i learnt the useful concept of being a<br>catalyst for change bringing people<br>together to realise their common<br>aspirations and supporting them to take<br>the lead<br>in this part of my life i was influenced<br>by the brazilian philosopher and<br>educator paolo freire and his methods of<br>reflection structural analysis and<br>action to bring about community driven<br>social change heady stuff for but in<br>one's early twenties<br>together with time spent in various<br>forms of social and environmental<br>activism including with friends at<br>bastian point this cemented my interest<br>in power and equity<br>and then after graduating i spent six<br>months living in a tumbledown house in<br>tolaga bay on the east coast as a<br>barefoot researcher on the impact of<br>industrial forestry on bali communities<br>shyly meeting on murai and with ngati<br>paro leaders such as api mahuika and noi<br>pifarangi<br>this immersion opened my eyes to the<br>but love pulled me to a different place<br>and i moved to hokianga in the far north<br>to live with guy my dear husband who's<br>in the front row here<br>there i learned amongst other things how<br>to live with no power no flush toilet<br>and no phone up a muddy road<br>how to milk a cow by hand and how to<br>feed a family on the smell of an oily<br>rag and how to write submissions and<br>appear at hearings<br>and later with two small daughters and<br>two step daughters i started work as a<br>completely untrained planner for<br>hokianga county council and later far<br>north district council<br>i learnt on the job and although i later<br>did an extramural masters of planning my<br>biggest learning was from the strong<br>communities that i i worked with<br>hokianga was and still is another<br>stronghold of tia maori and it was there<br>that i started to absorb ways of<br>thinking about people and place they<br>were quite at odds with my western<br>training<br>this led to my master's thesis which<br>took a critical and treaty-centred view<br>of the planning framework for maori land<br>eventually guy and i set up a<br>consultancy with him doing the<br>architectural design and me as a<br>freelance planner this enabled me to<br>take on new roles like being an rma<br>hearings commissioner and serving on the<br>northland conservation board<br>these were interesting and challenging<br>roles and could have led me to a future<br>defined by a particular kind of<br>leadership but ultimately it was all a<br>bit too limiting so for this and other<br>reasons we set off at the end of 99 to<br>here i work for the first two years for<br>the new zealand historic places trust<br>and alongside that was invited by claire<br>freeman who's in the audience here to<br>give a couple of lectures in the masters<br>of planning course and geography<br>within a couple of years i was a<br>professional practice fellow in the<br>department teaching planning papers<br>but alongside this i wanted to challenge<br>the unsatisfying way that the heritage<br>and planning sectors dealt with<br>landscape so i did my phd on cultural<br>values and landscapes supervised by<br>clare and the late and much loved ian<br>smith<br>what troubled me was that landscape<br>evaluation had become the realm of<br>professionals and fragmented amongst<br>them<br>the theme of integration across<br>knowledge systems became central to my<br>work from then on<br>most postgraduate studies in lecturing<br>taught me academic rigor but my prior<br>experiences helped me see the<br>opportunities for making academia much<br>more accessible that to the non-academic<br>world better at respecting the knowledge<br>and insights of communities better at<br>listening and communicating and better<br>at research collaborations<br>things moved quickly following my phd in<br>2005.<br>alongside my geography role jerry<br>carrington who's here in the audience as<br>well<br>invited me to help with this initiative<br>to bring together academics from across<br>the university interested in energy<br>issues and i had my first taste of the<br>exciting potential of working with<br>people from many disciplines<br>by the end of 2008 i had shifted to<br>becoming a full-time researcher what was<br>in the centre for the study of<br>agriculture food and environment or sea<br>safe<br>invited by hugh campbell who was then<br>the director thank you hugh<br>wherever you are<br>i became the director in 2011 and later<br>that year we named it the centre for<br>sustainability<br>the centre has always been a very<br>special place and i feel proud to be<br>such part of such a supportive and<br>brilliant whanau of staff and students<br>many of whom are here tonight<br>anyway one of my first projects at the<br>centre was co-leading a mars and<br>research program with henrik muller<br>thank you henrik for that opportunity on<br>the experiences of tangata kaitiaki of<br>coastal mahingakai and i have continued<br>to do research with maori communities<br>and i'm currently involved in a project<br>on kainga and climate change led by my<br>alongside this i was also inspired by<br>the idea of applying social science<br>thinking to what was at that time the<br>very technical topic of energy and this<br>led to research collaborations with<br>jerry with rob lawson who's here sarah<br>walton i'm not sure if you're here sarah<br>and many others in the energy cultures<br>research programs<br>lots of other funded research followed<br>included in energy transport coastal<br>issues climate change adaptation and<br>various other aspects of sustainability<br>transitions<br>but with all of these<br>i kept turning to the concept of culture<br>one of the reasons why a cultural<br>approach is helpful is that if you just<br>focus on individuals it can only take<br>you so far in understanding behaviour<br>and motivations<br>although we're individually influenced<br>by our genetics and our personal<br>psychology humans are fundamentally<br>social animals<br>we have a strong tendency to align our<br>beliefs and behaviours with those of<br>others we learn from the families we<br>brought up in from our friends and from<br>our peers<br>culture shapes how we live<br>how we operate as organizations and<br>businesses<br>so what is culture<br>if you've been looking at the dense and<br>mystifying<br>definition on the screen you've probably<br>been wondering where the exit door is<br>and that's the point you need to know<br>that this is one of the least obscure<br>definitions of culture<br>and by an author who i hugely admire<br>and culture as a concept is on the face<br>of it not easy to apply to<br>culture is a very old word and had<br>already branched into several meanings<br>before it entered the academic thinking<br>over the past hundred years and<br>particularly over the past 50 it's<br>become a key concept in many social<br>science disciplines and sub-disciplines<br>some of which i've listed here<br>and for the most part unfortunately<br>cultural theory has become so dense and<br>jargon-filled that it is completely<br>mystifying to lay people<br>as well as<br>and in its everyday sense culture is<br>equally confusing you probably use it to<br>mean many seemingly different things<br>without even considering it<br>you may use it to refer to the fact that<br>other people do different things<br>differently from you that's american<br>culture for you<br>you might use it to explain why things<br>are important to your identity that's<br>part of our culture<br>you might use it to refer to art and<br>performance<br>let's go and get a bit of culture and i<br>often see it used as a kind of<br>metaphorical shrug meaning well that's<br>just how it is we can't do anything<br>about it<br>it's hardly surprising that the cultural<br>academic raymond williams famously wrote<br>that culture is one of the two or three<br>most complicated words in the english<br>language<br>so how can we put this conceptually rich<br>but fragmented idea to work for the<br>this is a construction i made in 2009 at<br>the start of the first energy cultures<br>research program when we were trying to<br>make sense of the many theories on<br>culture and behaviour<br>i was looking for a simple but precise<br>way to express an insight i had about<br>culture<br>the idea of three linked stones came to<br>me one night fully formed<br>i made it the next morning and i think<br>it was rob i showed it to um first with<br>anyway that is the foundational idea<br>behind what we now call the cultures<br>framework<br>it was a seemingly small concept that we<br>first applied to trying to understand<br>why businesses and households weren't<br>being as energy efficient as they might<br>despite all of the financial and health<br>and comfort benefits<br>but the framework gave us unexpected<br>insights in an academic sense it was<br>fruitful<br>here's the energy cultures team where it<br>all started<br>over seven years we applied the<br>framework to a range of energy questions<br>and to transport issues refining as we<br>went and publishing papers in<br>international journals<br>we wrote our first theoretical paper<br>about it in 2010<br>we also wrote about the framework as the<br>conceptual glue that helped our<br>interdisciplinary team work together so<br>successfully<br>and many other papers some more<br>theoretical some reporting on our<br>findings<br>we were very excited when some other<br>research groups around the world started<br>to pick it up and apply it to other<br>sustainability related issues<br>since the energy cultures research<br>program ended in 2016 i've continued to<br>use and write about the framework in<br>other research projects and with some of<br>my postgraduate students along with some<br>others from the team<br>by 2018 it had spread its wings from<br>being the energy cultures framework to<br>simply the cultures framework as a<br>generally<br>applicable approach to sustainability<br>problems<br>and international researchers have kept<br>using it in even more contexts<br>so it's become a bit viral to use<br>today's phrase<br>just to give you an idea of the range it<br>has been used to explore building<br>retrofits in europe fuel poverty in new<br>zealand solar uptake in switzerland slum<br>housing in mumbai water use in the uk<br>cultural history in the black hills of<br>dakota and energy culture in rural<br>transylvania<br>i'd really like to know more about that<br>and i'll be talking about a few other<br>examples soon i'm currently writing a<br>book to try and haul all of this<br>together<br>for the sociologists and anthropologists<br>in the audience the cultures framework<br>builds on various fields of social<br>theory including structuration habitus<br>actor network theory socio-technical<br>systems social practice and other<br>cultural theories as well as systems<br>thinking<br>the rest of you should be happy that i'm<br>not going to talk about any of that<br>tonight<br>so what's the culture's framework all<br>about<br>it started as an integrator of cultural<br>concepts there were more than 150<br>definitions of culture in the 1950s the<br>last time anyone seriously counted and<br>there will be countless more today<br>but regardless of the discipline they<br>emerge from three main types of<br>characteristics keep coming up<br>firstly ways of thinking the ways that<br>people make sense of give meaning to and<br>evaluate the world<br>this includes their beliefs values and<br>norms their expectations and aspirations<br>about how life should be lived<br>secondly things that people do and how<br>they do them this includes every<br>everyday routines and habits as well as<br>actions or activities they might do<br>really but are still socially influenced<br>and thirdly the things that people make<br>things they acquire and things that they<br>have<br>this includes both physical things like<br>a car or food or an artwork and<br>non-physical things like software or<br>stories<br>one way to get your head around culture<br>is to simplify it even further and to<br>have think and do<br>the rubber bands show that these don't<br>exist independently but are strongly<br>linked and tend to align with one<br>another<br>many different definitions of culture<br>also mention knowledge skills and<br>language language includes distinctive<br>ways of communicating as i am tonight<br>or particular types of words or<br>expressions used by a group of people i<br>show these as part of the rubber bands<br>helping mediate and express how we think<br>so this is the cultures framework and<br>being academics if you want to be taken<br>seriously you have to align with<br>academic culture and therefore use<br>complicated sounding words<br>so rather than have think and do we talk<br>about materiality norms and practices<br>but they basically mean the same thing<br>and we turn the rubber bands into<br>so the framework is a stripped-down set<br>of core ideas about culture which as i<br>will show has been found to be<br>surprisingly useful for analyzing<br>for something to be called a culture a<br>group of people or organizations share a<br>largely similar similar set of things<br>they have think and do<br>the framework helps us identify patterns<br>of similar cultural characteristics<br>across a population and then see how<br>these relate to sustainability outcomes<br>for example studies in new zealand and<br>italy have identified groups of<br>households with cultural characteristics<br>that are associated with greater or<br>lesser energy efficiency<br>but as you'll see from other examples<br>i'll use you can use the framework with<br>anything sustainability related for<br>example to do with the environment human<br>here's a really simple example<br>i don't need to tell you that fossil<br>fuel vehicles in new zealand are one of<br>new zealand's biggest sources of carbon<br>emissions<br>so understanding why some people don't<br>want to have cars is pretty important<br>and interestingly there's a significant<br>portion of younger people who are<br>choosing not to drive or have a car<br>a few years ago we did a study for the<br>ministry of transport comparing one<br>group of young people who had a strong<br>car culture with others who weren't<br>interested the car culture group<br>obviously had cars and driver's license<br>and driving was their default choice for<br>mobility<br>and they spoke about their cars as<br>giving them freedom and independence and<br>they often disdained other modes<br>the other group who chosen not to get a<br>license or own a car<br>used many ways to get around which we<br>call multi-mobility<br>the transport involved quite different<br>material items bus passes rain jackets<br>walking shoes bikes skateboards<br>and to get around they walked bike took<br>buses used ubers and sometimes shared<br>rides with their mates or family<br>many were concerned about climate change<br>and for many sharing was an important<br>part of their life<br>but to our surprise this group shared<br>the same norms of freedom and<br>independence as the car culture group<br>except they felt freer and more<br>so here we see two distinct mobility<br>cultures with quite different<br>implications<br>for carbon emissions<br>but choosing not to own a car can be<br>hard for most of us because there are<br>many influences beyond an individual's<br>control that can reinforce the<br>domination of car culture these include<br>things like past investments and<br>motorways advertising campaigns from car<br>and suv manufacturers and government<br>policies including things like urban<br>form<br>we call these external influences on a<br>culture<br>i'm now going to talk through a few<br>examples of research that use the<br>culture's framework to explore why<br>this research in zambia looked at why<br>gov the government and ngos found it<br>hard to persuade households to replace<br>their charcoal stoves with other<br>low-cost cooking methods<br>the charcoal stoves cause respiratory<br>problems especially amongst women and<br>children<br>and also demand for charcoal causes<br>widespread deforestation and because of<br>this it's getting harder to obtain and<br>it's quite costly for families<br>but families didn't want to change away<br>using the cultures framework the study<br>found that the traditional stove not<br>only made food taste delicious<br>but also enabled everyday social<br>interactions and allowed people to<br>efficiently do other household chores<br>alongside their cooking<br>because of this it isn't just a question<br>of a straightforward swap of one<br>technology for another<br>the charcoal stove is an integral part<br>of culture so high charcoal<br>price and the availability of<br>alternatives aren't enough to trigger<br>change i'm emphasizing here those<br>here's another very different study<br>and do have a look at the name of the<br>study how many admirals does it take to<br>change a light bulb<br>this one looked at why you us navy<br>warships weren't adopting led lights<br>even though this had been part of their<br>strategy for at least 10 years<br>the research<br>revealed aspects of the navy's norms<br>materiality and practices that<br>interacted together to support the<br>existing inefficiently inefficient and<br>costly lighting system<br>this included beliefs about energy being<br>efficient being cheap and abundant<br>and the navy mission being war not<br>efficiency<br>and material aspects like his existing<br>fixtures fixtures and the maintenance<br>requirements and various practices such<br>as acquisition processes and officer<br>rotation<br>the study also identified a whole lot of<br>external influences that effectively<br>maintained this culture right up to the<br>levels of federal government and<br>congressional processes<br>together this<br>system of interlocked cultural<br>influences was preventing the navy from<br>making a very simple change to led<br>lights that would be cheaper because<br>they're longer lasting and require far<br>we've also used the cultures framework<br>at a much broader scale looking at why<br>nations have such very different<br>decarbonisation pathways<br>it's probably the best part of the show<br>yeah so this this was work um that i<br>worked with with a couple of<br>international colleagues um and we<br>looked at um using the cultures<br>framework to<br>look at why nations had such very<br>different decarbonisation pathways<br>and this cultural analysis helped us see<br>how government level norms materiality<br>and practices had cemented over time so<br>we looked at at a temporal<br>view of culture there resulting in a<br>very very different national level<br>commitments to moving away from fossil<br>fuels<br>so the cultures framework is doing<br>several things that make it useful as an<br>analytical tool firstly it takes an<br>actor-centered perspective that is when<br>we analyze we're looking at the cultural<br>dynamics of this group of people or that<br>organization or that sector<br>and it doesn't just focus on those three<br>stones the materiality norms and<br>practices but how these interact and<br>tend to reinforce each other including<br>through these forms of knowledge and<br>language<br>and particularly what this means for the<br>sustainability issues that we're<br>the dotted circle invites us to think<br>about the agency that the actors have<br>that is to what extent does this person<br>or organization have power to change the<br>unsustainable aspects of their culture<br>inside the ring are those aspects of<br>culture that the actor may have the<br>ability to change under their own steam<br>and outside the rings are things that<br>shape their culture but the actor<br>doesn't have too much likelihood of<br>also the framework helps us think about<br>how culture acts at many scales because<br>many of those external influences are<br>cultural in their own right<br>but with a much bigger scope of<br>influence<br>this helps us think about how power<br>if we keep traveling up scales of<br>cultural influence<br>we eventually get to long-standing<br>western ideologies that are the<br>fundamental cause of the sustainability<br>crisis<br>such as the growth paradigm the belief<br>that endless consumptive growth is<br>possible and indeed essential<br>and another of these problematic<br>ideologies the belief that people are<br>separate from and have dominion over<br>nature<br>many other cultures and particularly<br>indigenous cultures do not share these<br>beliefs and i'm sure that many of you in<br>the room don't either<br>but these ideologies have formed tight<br>cultural alignments with practices and<br>materiality and are conveyed through<br>particular forms of language and<br>knowledge systems to underpin dominant<br>global economic systems<br>and pick unpicking long-standing<br>ideologies such as this would be the<br>most effective way to bring about<br>radical sustainable change but extremely<br>difficult given the powerful actors they<br>serve<br>let's now look at culture and change<br>the framework can also be used to help<br>understand cultural change and its role<br>in sustainability transitions<br>while culture as you have seen is often<br>pretty much self-replicating and hard to<br>change cultures do and can change over<br>time<br>sometimes one seemingly tiny change to<br>one cultural element can have a really<br>big impact on other aspects of culture<br>and thereby on the sustainability<br>outcomes<br>this can be triggered internally that is<br>something initiated by the actor or<br>externally<br>and i'm going to start with an example<br>this example is from research led by<br>sarah walton in the management<br>department here and some others at the<br>centre for sustainability<br>they were asked by australia aid to<br>evaluate the success of an initiative in<br>vanuatu to make solar-powered lamps more<br>easily affordable for communities that<br>had no electricity<br>until then households had used kerosene<br>lamps which were expensive messy<br>dangerous caused indoor pollution and<br>generated carbon emissions<br>usually households had only one because<br>of the expense and this tended to be<br>managed and used by the males<br>then ausaid offered a subsidy to<br>suppliers which meant that solar lamps<br>became<br>widely available<br>when households started to acquire and<br>use these lamps which could be charged<br>in the sun every day a whole lot of<br>practices started to change<br>they were cheap safe and easy to run so<br>households got more than one<br>women and children could use them and<br>could do things like homework and<br>weaving in the long evenings<br>they supported more socializing after<br>dark and evening activities like fishing<br>there was less need to work in the cash<br>economy as they didn't have to buy<br>kerosene<br>this led to new norms and beliefs such<br>as lights being for everyone not just<br>for males sunlight being made by god and<br>therefore trustworthy and an aversion to<br>this growing trust in sunlight lead to<br>new aspirations for other solar<br>appliances such as small solar panels<br>this meant people could have mobile<br>phones because they could now charge<br>them<br>this is a great example of a cultural<br>change with important sustainability<br>gains for health women's livelihoods<br>education and environment although there<br>will of course be issues with plastic<br>waste as the lamps will have a limited<br>life so it's not a completely positive<br>story<br>what it illustrates well though is how<br>there can be cascading changes to<br>culture from what seems like a small<br>change in the first instance<br>we can see this in another very<br>different example this is again a sarah<br>walton's research<br>she used the culture's framework to<br>investigate businesses that had improved<br>their energy efficiency<br>some of these businesses had started<br>their cha<br>journey with a material change such as<br>replacing a machine that had broken down<br>with the more efficient one which then<br>led to changes and practices and norms<br>some of them started with changes in<br>practices such as adopting lean<br>manufacturing as a business policy and<br>this led to consequential changes to<br>their<br>norms and their materiality<br>and some started with changes to their<br>norms like wanting to appeal to the<br>growing market for eco products and this<br>led to changes in materiality and<br>practices what they produced and how<br>they did it<br>in this sense culture acts quite like a<br>complex adaptive system with one change<br>leading to others sometimes in<br>predictable ways and sometimes in<br>seemingly unpredictably with unintended<br>consequences<br>for example<br>when people put put in heat pumps which<br>are very inefficient sorry very energy<br>efficient households surprisingly<br>use it<br>sorry surprisingly often end up using<br>more power than with the old resistive<br>heaters<br>this makes engineers scratch their heads<br>disapprovingly and call this the rebound<br>effect or the juven's paradox<br>but it's not paradoxical whatsoever<br>through the cultures lens we can see<br>that norms and practices around heating<br>have changed as they've become<br>accustomed to being warmer<br>probably very sensibly if they're living<br>but consequential change doesn't always<br>occur even if people want to change they<br>may be locked into their current pattern<br>because of internally conflicting norms<br>the two colour box of norms indicates<br>that people can have different<br>aspirations that don't necessarily align<br>for example they want to reduce their<br>travel related carbon emissions on the<br>one hand but they feel they should drive<br>their children to school for safety<br>reasons on the other<br>so<br>nothing changes<br>and external influences such as streets<br>being unsafe for kids cycling might also<br>lock them in we can be unhappy or<br>uncomfortable with our culture but stuck<br>this is where changes to external<br>influences becomes critically important<br>continuing with the example of personal<br>transport there are many changes that<br>can be made to external influences that<br>can help change our mobility culture and<br>recent examples are the ev rebate scheme<br>and the increase in cycling<br>infrastructure both driven by policy<br>changes at central and local government<br>levels<br>policy isn't the only external influence<br>by any means but it is an important one<br>in the energy cultures project we used a<br>cultural analysis as the basis for<br>developing policy advice for more<br>sustainable energy and transport<br>by looking at existing cultures we could<br>see cultural traits that had the latent<br>ability to drive change in a more<br>sustainable direction so things that<br>people had but weren't able to express<br>because they had conflicting norms<br>possibly<br>and by analyzing external influences on<br>those cultures we could see where they<br>were already driving change in the right<br>direction and where they were preventing<br>or slowing change<br>from this we could recommend alteration<br>of existing policies that were blocking<br>change or driving change in the wrong<br>direction as well as new policies to<br>support latent cultural change for more<br>sustainable outcomes<br>from this we produced a number of<br>two-page policy briefs aimed at busy<br>public servants<br>and it's pleasing to see that a number<br>of our recommendations have been<br>implemented in some form but whether as<br>a direct result of these it's very hard<br>cultural change can also happen as as a<br>result of a completely unexpected event<br>covert was astonishingly successful in<br>changing mobility practices<br>by people having to work from home use<br>video conferencing and constraining<br>international travel<br>but some of those changes go beyond just<br>a temporary shift in practices and<br>appear to be now becoming normalized<br>like ongoing high use of zoom meetings<br>and these have been cemented through<br>material changes such as setting up home<br>offices and investment in in video<br>conferencing facilities<br>but what's most exciting to me is when<br>we see cultural change messing up and<br>breaking through the agency barrier this<br>dotted line here and reshaping the<br>forces that usually constrain us from<br>change<br>here's an example<br>as recently as five years ago almost<br>every major player in the new zealand<br>electricity sector they're all here<br>we're giving reasons why households<br>should not be adopting pv that is solar<br>generation<br>the government smart grid forum lines<br>companies electricity retailers<br>electricity authority parliamentary<br>commissioner for the environment energy<br>efficiency and conservation<br>authority are who's who of the<br>electricity<br>sector<br>but we were curious about why households<br>were still still adopting pv despite all<br>of this external pushback<br>our research found that pv aligned with<br>a whole lot of kiwi aspirations even if<br>it ended up being a bit more expensive<br>than grid power for some people<br>aspirations like a desire for<br>independence lack of trust and<br>electricity companies wanting greater<br>financial control environmental concern<br>and so forth<br>and what happened was that more and more<br>households kept on adopting pv<br>and eventually this broke down the<br>dominant belief by the electricity<br>sector that kiwi shouldn't be doing this<br>ah they are doing it<br>this acceptance by the sector has driven<br>changes right across the entire sector<br>to accommodate and support decentralized<br>power like pv and these changes are<br>still ongoing not perfectly yet but<br>we're getting there<br>so the sector's beliefs and desire to<br>continue business as usual i.e their<br>culture were no match for the widespread<br>shift in energy culture amongst the<br>households<br>this kind of change gives me most hope<br>for a sustainability transition this<br>this that is where isolated cultural<br>shifts mess up and break through that<br>another example is the rapid<br>normalization of divestment from fossil<br>fuels from a seemingly symbolic action<br>by a handful of organizations mainly<br>universities and this university of<br>otago was one of these only six years<br>ago<br>to a core part of the rapidly growing<br>responsible investment sector today to<br>buy over 14 trillion dollars has already<br>been shifted from the fossil fuel<br>industry to date much of this by major<br>another example is the rapid shift from<br>the keep it in the ground message as a<br>protest movement only five years ago to<br>this being now the strong message from<br>the highly influential international<br>if you look around in the media and<br>amongst people that you know you'll<br>start to notice examples of how<br>collective cultural shifts are starting<br>to reshape wider systems of production<br>towards more sustainable outcomes and an<br>example is the increase in veganism and<br>vegetarianism<br>the cultures framework helps us<br>understand culture<br>but it also opens our eyes to the value<br>of different cultural understandings<br>it pleases me enormously to see the<br>increasing influence of ways of thinking<br>that challenge the fundamental western<br>ideologies that got us into this mess in<br>the first place<br>for example maori principles such as<br>those described in this book in 2010 are<br>not only embedded into maori businesses<br>such as whale watch in kaikoura but are<br>now starting to reshape how other<br>sectors think about their relationship<br>with and responsibilities to the natural<br>world<br>and just one example is this 2020 report<br>from the primary sector council which<br>outlines a new approach for our food and<br>fibre sector based on maori principles<br>and partnerships<br>at this stage it is just a tiny step in<br>the think aspect of cultural change<br>and possibly some way from influencing<br>what farmers really do<br>and think and make but it is a start<br>more generally i believe that tia maori<br>principles in mataranga have a huge<br>potential to under underpin aotearoa's<br>sustainability journey<br>with concepts such as kaitiakitanga<br>responsibility for and<br>reciprocity with the place that you live<br>in<br>tanga to order thai order the integral<br>links between a healthy environment and<br>healthy people<br>and the need for decision making to<br>to conclude i want to first acknowledge<br>the many people who've contributed to<br>the development testing and refinement<br>of the cultures framework the energy<br>cultures team where it all started<br>other researchers here at otago and<br>around the world<br>postgraduate students here and<br>internationally including a number that<br>i've supervised<br>and many people giving feedback in my<br>seminars workshops and conference<br>presentations with academic and lay<br>audiences<br>and i also acknowledge the many other<br>cultural academics who've whose work has<br>inspired me and on which i've built<br>thank you all you've helped make<br>something quite special i think a theory<br>and an analytical approach which helps<br>reveal the critically important role of<br>culture in sustainability transitions<br>the cultures framework has been<br>described as having a deceptive<br>simplicity<br>it's about as simple as you can get<br>what i especially like about it is that<br>it can be used as a as a tool for<br>thinking by anyone at all as well as<br>used academically to explore deeply<br>complex issues<br>i hope it helps you to think about the<br>culture that you're part of for example<br>in your home life your work life and<br>your wider social life<br>and maybe to consider where you or your<br>organization is stuck in an<br>unsustainable cultural dynamic and the<br>potential for change<br>if there are external influences that<br>are preventing you can you band together<br>with others to alter them<br>or are you part of a dominant culture<br>which makes it hard for others to change<br>importantly can you be part of a messing<br>up of cultural change that might become<br>transformational<br>reflecting on my journey to this point i<br>can see how the learnings i spoke about<br>at the start<br>have somehow found expression in the<br>development<br>use<br>and application<br>of the cultures framework<br>i didn't realize this until after i'd<br>written the whole talk and prompted by<br>etienne who kindly had listened to a<br>trial run<br>he's right of course it's all there<br>to finish i want to come back to my<br>starting point the world in crisis<br>and the role of the university<br>and the gleam of the possible<br>despite my notes of hope we have a<br>massive task ahead to restore the planet<br>to a safe place for humanity and other<br>living things<br>we have very little time and every<br>fraction of a degree<br>warming that we can avoid is critical<br>if we as a university are not actively<br>working to be part of the solution we<br>are the problem<br>every discipline can and should<br>contribute<br>we have an extraordinary depth of<br>discipline specific knowledge that can<br>be put to work for the sustainability<br>transition<br>but academics have traditionally been<br>rewarded for reductive abstract<br>fragmented and inwardly follow focused<br>scholarship<br>we need to learn new ways of working<br>that are better fit for complex problems<br>approaches that are integrative<br>interdisciplinary accessible and<br>externally engaged<br>we also need to ensure that all of our<br>students graduate with the knowledge and<br>skills needed to take their part in<br>constructing a sustainable future<br>and finally we need to look to our own<br>cultures<br>as research groups departments divisions<br>and the university as a whole<br>to unpick how we are replicating<br>business as usual and to rebuild our<br>cultures so that they will deliver a<br>just and sustainable world<br>kahuri tiana koto<br>it's my great pleasure janet to give you<br>the vote of thanks tonight and in doing<br>so i want to comment on<br>two characteristics of your research<br>that you demonstrated fully in your<br>lecture and that i think it's important<br>for us as a community to say bravo to<br>you for and to be reminded of how<br>important they are so the first<br>characteristic that i think it's worth<br>emphasizing is<br>that for you the value of your research<br>is that it responds so directly to the<br>communities in which you find yourself<br>and you are absolutely passionate about<br>ensuring that your research matters to<br>the people and communities that you're<br>in<br>um and that and you know pbrf speak<br>equals impact and so university managers<br>like that<br>but more importantly we as people need<br>to acknowledge that and say thank you<br>thank you that you care so much about<br>your communities<br>you mentioned that your journey here has<br>been perhaps unorthodox and i think<br>maybe that's true but i wonder too if in<br>fact actually that journey was essential<br>because what you bring to us in this<br>community<br>is a reminder constantly that our<br>research must matter to the communities<br>in which we find ourselves otherwise we<br>are in danger of just remaining in ivory<br>towers so thank you for that<br>and and secondly janet um i think you<br>have demonstrated really clearly here<br>the value of an interdisciplinary<br>approach um and you know you've you've<br>emphasized for us for introduced to us<br>the the problem of the sustainability<br>crisis<br>and you've shown us how it's not just a<br>problem of heart or physical science but<br>it's very much a problem of social<br>science<br>and i just think it's wonderful that<br>you've brought that to this lecture and<br>that you bring that to your research<br>and your important contribution in<br>particular<br>is that whole question and answer of<br>saying this is a problem of of culture<br>as much as it is a problem of uh geology<br>and and weather and all sorts of things<br>that we hear the physical scientists<br>tell us we have to appreciate it's a<br>problem of culture and you've developed<br>a framework that's beautifully simple<br>and yet deeply meaningful it explains<br>how culture works it explains how<br>culture can change<br>i was um chatting to a family member<br>this afternoon who asked what i was<br>doing this evening i said i'm coming<br>along to an ipl uh what's the area of<br>sustainability and he said what what is<br>sustainability doing within the division<br>of humanities<br>and i think you've demonstrated that<br>beautifully actually<br>in my opinion you have demonstrated the<br>strength of the humanities scholar at<br>work tonight you have drawn us in to<br>reflect on what it is to be a member of<br>the various societies and communities in<br>which we make our place of standing<br>how have we come to this place this way<br>of thinking this way of behaving<br>in the assumptions that we have and how<br>might we contribute to the community to<br>which we belong so bravo thank you so<br>much janet<br>thank you for providing us with a window<br>into your world of research and thank<br>you for causing us to think and to<br>reflect<br>i have the great pleasure<br>just stepping back here for a second<br>do i have that pleasure<br>paper hide and seek here i'll give you<br>the gift later<br>i have the great pleasure bringing you<br>this gift as a sign of our appreciation<br>for this evening but more importantly<br>for the years of work that you have put<br>in so bravo thank you<br>foreign<br>oh<br>day<br>okay<br>and my my last job for this evening is<br>to thank you all for coming and to<br>invite you warmly to come and share with<br>us<br>and we're going to head over to the<br>staff club for those who are able thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
