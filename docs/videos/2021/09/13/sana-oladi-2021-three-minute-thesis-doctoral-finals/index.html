These motor analogies are designed specifically to promote safe(r) landing and I am examining their efficacy using biomechanical (effect on body) and cognitive (effect on mind) measures.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>would you please welcome out the speaker<br>have you ever slipped on something and<br>mid-air thought oh boy this is really<br>going to hurt<br>well when older people fall the<br>consequences can be more severe like hip<br>fractures and in a lot of cases they're<br>never released from the hospital<br>there are also high health care costs<br>too<br>and you in new zealand every year ball<br>related injuries cost around two billion<br>dollars<br>so what if we could teach older people<br>how to fall safely<br>like twist your body so bony areas like<br>your wrist and your hip doesn't come in<br>contact with the ground<br>there's a problem though we fall in many<br>different ways you can fall forward<br>backwards sideways and for every<br>different ball type you actually need a<br>different landing technique you can't<br>expect when an older person is falling<br>they'll have enough time to think wait a<br>minute what direction am i falling<br>forward how can i slightly bend my<br>elbows<br>so how do we get older people to land<br>safely regardless of the direction<br>they're falling and without giving too<br>many instructions<br>well we asked the experts people who had<br>learned how to fall safely and they all<br>said a good fall has three main<br>characteristics it's soft<br>slow and silent<br>so we decided to develop a motor analogy<br>that promotes a soft slow and silent<br>quality<br>what's a motor analogy i hear you ask<br>well you know when you're driving have<br>you seen the sign merge like a zipper<br>you immediately knew what you need to do<br>or for a free throw in basketball you<br>can simply just say make a goose head to<br>throw the ball<br>similarly if we use an analogy for<br>landing safety we won't have to give<br>people multiple instructions<br>so we developed the motor analogy land<br>like a feather because a feather lands<br>softly slowly and silently then we<br>tested the efficacy of our analogy we<br>put multiple sensors on different body<br>segments of over a hundred participants<br>and we caused them to fall unexpectedly<br>in different directions<br>then we looked into biomechanical<br>parameters that characterized a safe<br>fall and what we found was the group<br>that received the motor analogy felt<br>with significantly less impact force and<br>risk of fractures in other words they<br>actually fell safer and this is so<br>exciting because as much as we want to<br>prevent falls from happening they're<br>still going to happen but if we could<br>reduce the severity of injury with a<br>simple water analogy not only are we<br>going to save on health care costs most<br>importantly we will save older adults a<br>lot of pain and success</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
