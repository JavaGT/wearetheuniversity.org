My PhD research investigates how river re-diversion alters the physical health of estuaries, focusing on the morphodynamics and hydrodynamics of the Maketū estuary in the Bay<br>of Plenty in response to the partial re-diversion of the Kaituna River.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so our tenth and final speaker in this<br>estuarine restoration<br>can we put things right<br>what do you think happens if you don't<br>have fresh water to drink anymore they<br>will die right<br>estuaries are where rivers connect to<br>seeds and they're alive just like us so<br>the same thing will happen to them<br>quite often we change the dynamics of<br>estuaries by building dams or diverting<br>rivers but we forget that there are<br>consequences to these changes<br>the answer you can see in the photo is<br>called the mecca to essary in the bay of<br>plankton new zealand<br>in its prime it used to be a huge trade<br>center and it was full of fish so a lot<br>of people relied on it for their<br>livelihood<br>back in 1950s it was also a hot spot for<br>flooding so the river flowing into it<br>was diverted out to the sea<br>without enough fresh water this story<br>started to die<br>but don't worry this isn't another sad<br>environmental story<br>the eevee and the locals were deeply<br>concerned about the loss of ecosystem so<br>they did everything they could they<br>could to make a change<br>and finally in 2020 the bay of puente<br>regional council diverted 20 of the<br>fresh water back to the market to<br>history using automatic gates<br>now why is this significant this whole<br>project has provided us with the<br>opportunity to further our knowledge in<br>srn restoration<br>specifically using large-scale<br>engineering solutions<br>and for my part i have dedicated my<br>whole research to see the effects of<br>this project and help us avoid future<br>mistakes<br>how do i do that well i collect data<br>using cutting-edge instruments all<br>throughout the history<br>during the five weeks of my field work i<br>got to swim in the market to history and<br>walk on this smelly month and i believe<br>that brought me and my kids much closer<br>together and i finally understood why<br>people are so passionate about it<br>i must admit that market to pies were<br>bonus as well<br>now i know you're waiting for some good<br>news well<br>based on my results only two weeks after<br>the gates were commissioned we see that<br>the water quality is increasing and<br>improving<br>that's great and the history is coming<br>back to life slowly<br>good so our job is done<br>not so fast what about the long-term<br>effects<br>is the estuary going to adapt to sea<br>level rise in like 100 years<br>or what if instead of 20 percent of<br>fresh water we added 30 percent of fresh<br>water<br>these are the questions that i'm going<br>to explore in my research to restore the<br>lifeblood of our communities and maybe<br>have a positive impact on this beautiful<br>blue planet we call home</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
