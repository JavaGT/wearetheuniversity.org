When coming up with their decision, the experts consider multiple pieces of information of many different forms. AI is used to learn this decision-making process and can help researchers ascertain what is influencing expert’s decisions.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>would you please welcome our both<br>speaker<br>julia falconer using artificial<br>intelligence to understand decision<br>put your hand up if you think it's gonna<br>rain tomorrow<br>okay i see a couple of shy hands in the<br>audience<br>here are some things to think about how<br>sure are you with that decision<br>and how did you come up with that<br>decision did you check matt servers this<br>morning would your band ain't kind of<br>tingling<br>well my research is to answer these<br>sorts of questions<br>mainly one what is an individual's or<br>group's uncertainty around an event<br>occurring and two how did they come up<br>with that decision in the first place<br>what's influencing them<br>so how do i get someone's uncertainty<br>well as a statistician i already have a<br>way i can do this<br>i can ask you for the quantiles of the<br>distribution<br>but what's the most obvious score with<br>this<br>who here knows what the quantiles of<br>distribution is<br>exactly no normal person has any idea<br>what i'm talking about buddy<br>so instead in my research<br>i get information from a decision-making<br>task<br>say what the weather example i might<br>give you all the weather reports and<br>photos from the previous day and get you<br>to tell me whether or not it's going to<br>rain tomorrow<br>i might get you and the person next to<br>you and the whole room to-do list so now<br>i have all this information i can use to<br>come up with the uncertainty of it<br>raining tomorrow<br>and to do this i use artificial<br>intelligence ai more specifically for<br>the nerds deep learning<br>my ai model sees all the information you<br>see when making your decisions and<br>learns to mimic your decision-making<br>process<br>outputting the uncertainty of an event<br>occurring and all the mathematical junk<br>i need without having to ask you<br>directly<br>pretty cool right<br>now this weather example is pretty basic<br>why would i have to ask you about it<br>rainy tomorrow when i have hundreds of<br>years of weather adapter<br>my research deals in more complex<br>situations where we don't have data<br>an example of this might be plane's<br>crashing this doesn't happen every day<br>so to get the uncertainty of a plane<br>crashing i have to ask someone<br>say an engineer<br>so i use my ai model to get the<br>knowledge from them<br>but<br>can we trust their knowledge<br>how do we know that their decisions<br>aren't strongly influenced by irrelevant<br>things<br>this is the next stage of my research<br>to be able to learn how we're making our<br>decisions<br>to eliminate bias when i'm trying to<br>output uncertainty from my ai model<br>and this is the scope of my research<br>to make a superior human computer i mean<br>sorry<br>to<br>use ai to help us to understand human<br>decision making</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
