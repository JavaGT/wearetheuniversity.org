My research seeks to understand how colour influences sport behaviour, by examining the effect of background colour and uniform colour on performance of motor tasks, such as passing and kicking.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you please welcome<br>speaker<br>silhouette<br>the effect of uniform color in sports<br>if you're watching a boxing fight with<br>two equally talented athletes<br>one in red and one in blue who would you<br>bet<br>on i would bet on red because according<br>to a study by hill and barton athletes<br>in red are 62 more likely to win than<br>athletes in blue<br>possibly because red symbolizes the<br>meaning of dominance and threat in<br>nature<br>similar findings have been found in<br>other combat sports such as wrestling<br>and taekwondo<br>as well as team sports such as rugby and<br>football<br>since then many researchers have<br>attempted to<br>examine the effect of colored spots<br>i too decided to examine the effect of<br>color especially uniform color as part<br>of my thesis<br>in one of our experimental studies<br>participants were asked to complete a<br>basketball passing task against an image<br>of an opponent either in green<br>red or grey uniform<br>we found that participants were more<br>likely to make a pass that will be<br>intercepted when seeing an opponent in a<br>green uniform compared to a red uniform<br>this may be because we often associate<br>the meaning of go with green<br>like traffic lights<br>that is participants were classically<br>conditioned to go whenever they saw the<br>and this raises an interesting question<br>if you are more likely to make a pass<br>that will be intercepted when seeing a<br>green uniform<br>do teams with green uniform have more<br>number of intercepts<br>so for our next study we decided to look<br>at real life data by comparing the mean<br>number of intercepts made by different<br>team colors during 2015 and 2019 netball<br>world cup<br>as expected we found that teams in green<br>uniforms made significantly more number<br>of intercepts than any other team colors<br>our findings suggest that uniform color<br>can influence our motor behavior that is<br>consistent with the meaning that it<br>carries<br>for example<br>green to go<br>and red to stop<br>and this raises a lot of interesting<br>research questions<br>for example does that mean we have to<br>put a band on wearing green or red<br>uniforms now<br>what other sport or even non-sport<br>behaviors can we influence or even<br>manipulate with color<br>indeed further studies are necessary for<br>us to definitively answer these<br>questions<br>so next time you choose the color of<br>your shirt think about the meaning that<br>it conveys and the type of influence<br>that you want to observe<br>for example if you don't want your<br>husband to get a new car maybe wear a<br>red shirt<br>but if you do want your boss to give you<br>that green light to your next business<br>plan consider wearing a green shirt</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
