A zine is basically your <br>own homemade magazine. Sometimes it's printed  <br>sometimes it's the original. They come in all <br>sorts of shapes and sizes. Sometimes it's comics  <br>inside, you might do reviews of your favourite <br>games. Like this little mini game review Zine.  <br>It might just be artwork, drawings from your <br>sketchbook. It might be articles and essays  <br>about something that you're interested in. <br>Zines can be about anything and they come in  <br>all sorts of shapes. The most common one is <br>probably A5 and for that, you're just folding over  <br>pieces of paper and stapling them together. <br>Some people sew them into little booklets.  <br>I've got zines that fit <br>into little matchboxes—tiny  <br>little miniature zines. Some people make zines <br>that fold out like concertinas. Any kind of  <br>shape or format works and we are interested to <br>see you make something strange and wonderful.  <br>So send us your amazing scenes! Send them by <br>email, send them by post and remember put a photo  <br>or video on Instagram with the #futuredesigners.nz <br>and you might be in to win. Even if you don't win  <br>just have fun making something wonderful. So make <br>your zine and enter the competition, you can send  <br>it to us digitally via email or you can send it <br>to our address if it's a physical zine <br>we will choose our favourites and there will be prizes and <br>they'll also be displayed at Wellington Zinefest.  <br>We'll have a special display. We look <br>forward to seeing your work on October 11st!</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
