Understanding how and when these fascinating behaviours evolve helps us to tease apart the factors that drive animal diversity.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so would you please welcome our second<br>speaker this evening<br>simon connery sexual cannibalism in new<br>zealand nursery group spikes<br>no one makes more sacrifices for their<br>children than spiders<br>this is a pair of new zealand nursing<br>rep spiders meeting in my lap<br>highlighted on screen is the male's<br>genital inserted into the female<br>good for him<br>however the rest of him is inserted into<br>the jaws of his mate as she digests him<br>spidermating often involves the female<br>eating the male otherwise known as<br>sexual cannibalism<br>this is because<br>as far as evolution is concerned<br>all that matters is that his genetic<br>code is passed on to his young<br>preferably strong healthy young<br>his body can provide an important meal<br>to the mother of these young and give<br>his other spotlights and yes spiderlings<br>is the technical term<br>the best possible start in life<br>this is also related to male genital<br>damage<br>essentially in many spiders when males<br>make with females their genitals become<br>broken and are unusable afterwards<br>unable to mate and with no evolutionary<br>purpose to continue living but mayor<br>really has no reason not to sacrifice<br>himself the benefit of his mate and his<br>resulting young<br>so these two factors promote each other<br>in what i call the cycle of sex death<br>death strain<br>my research includes investigating the<br>effect of this cycle on new zealand<br>nursing prospects such as our friends<br>here<br>and seeing what they can tell us about<br>the evolution of these behaviors<br>my work has shown that male genitals and<br>these spiders do in fact break<br>and as you can see i've shown that<br>females are more than willing to kill<br>the mates<br>so far<br>so good<br>however<br>male spiders in this species are<br>less than willing to be eaten and often<br>try and escape from the female<br>though not quite successfully<br>this doesn't really match up with the<br>cycle of sex and death i've discussed<br>so why might this be<br>well<br>one possibility is that the male wants<br>to stay alive to guard his mate and make<br>sure that she doesn't mate with anyone<br>else<br>this could also explain why males break<br>off their genitals<br>as these could act to plug up the female<br>so that she has difficulty making the<br>game<br>whatever the answer these spiders are a<br>crucial piece in the evolutionary<br>puzzles of sexual cannibalism the<br>diversity of spiders<br>and all of their weird<br>weird behaviours<br>and in a small way they help us<br>understand the incredible diversity of<br>the natural world<br>not that spiders really care about any<br>of this though<br>when it comes to life<br>sacrifice<br>and evolution they can only do whatever<br>spider can<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
