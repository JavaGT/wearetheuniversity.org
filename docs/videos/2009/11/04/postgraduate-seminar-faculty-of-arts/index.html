I'll add my welcomes um I'm<br>the associate Dean postgraduate and in<br>this faculty what I do is look after all<br>matters PhD and for some of you who<br>haven't yet begun postgraduate work this<br>might seem something way out there but<br>um a ba honor<br>Masters a PG dip all of those can lead<br>to really interesting careers for you<br>but they can also lead you on a research<br>track that will take you to PhD and if<br>any of you are interested in finding out<br>the kinds of Pathways that you want how<br>the pathways you're looking at choosing<br>now might lead to PhD um then feel free<br>to talk to me or any of The Graduate<br>advisers here they'll know what to do<br>and what to explain um to<br>you PG work May begin with honors and PG<br>dips but it can take you into a much<br>more intensive research centered<br>exploration where you begin to make your<br>own contribution to knowledge under the<br>guidance of our internationally<br>recognized researchers who are also<br>passionate about their subject and yours<br>so PhD work and Master's by thesis work<br>um enables you to pursue a research<br>career academically but also in research<br>institutes and postally around the world<br>and in New Zealand and it enables you to<br>become a um a member of a um community<br>of Scholars that exists around the globe<br>but also here at the University of<br>Oakland with um other Scholars who are<br>engaging in areas that are similar to<br>yours so writing a thesis of 80 to<br>100,000 words might seem like a daunting<br>task right now but it's also a very<br>Incredible Journey of learning that you<br>can engage with and um<br>undertake in order to support your PhD<br>and um Master studies in addition to our<br>supervisors who are active researchers<br>themselves we offer you a graduate study<br>center if you're a completing<br>undergraduate student and you're<br>interested in um postgraduate work you<br>can appli for our competitive summer<br>scholarships if you're thinking about<br>PhD you can and you um enroll you can<br>apply to our doctoral research fund it's<br>a fund that supports your travel to do<br>archival research or field work in other<br>countries or other parts of New Zealand<br>we offer PhD writing programs and a<br>writing Retreat that takes you away for<br>a week in order to pursue your writing<br>without having other interruptions um<br>that come from your everyday life and we<br>don't let people have access to email<br>while they're away so there's absolutely<br>no interruptions whatsoever of course<br>departments and the faculty and the<br>University at large offer a range of<br>open seminars and public public lectures<br>that you are all invited to attend<br>essentially there are some terrific<br>Support Services in the Student Learning<br>Center um on research and writing and<br>how we can support you with that so<br>there are lots of people here who can<br>answer more directly the questions that<br>you may have in terms of pursuing your<br>research but don't stop um thinking<br>about research opportunities and<br>postgraduate work as just being the next<br>degree there's a whole pathway of<br>opportunities out there for you to<br>than um it's my pleasure to welcome you<br>all very warmly to this the postgraduate<br>information evening for the faculty of<br>Arts please I mean please do keep coming<br>along you can't all just hide behind the<br>cameraman some will have to be in front<br>but uh it's it's really lovely to see so<br>many people with an interest in doing<br>post graduate study in The Faculty um I<br>won't speak for very long because there<br>are people who'll be able to give you<br>much more information and I hope that we<br>will get through the speechy part fairly<br>quickly so that you can grab a drink and<br>find people who you can really button<br>hole in a corner and ask about your<br>favorite discipline and<br>topics I do remember surprise surprise<br>what uh my post-graduate years were and<br>I really enjoyed it there's lots of<br>reasons for doing postgraduate study<br>there's reasons in terms terms of<br>developing the skills that you've<br>already started getting them more finely<br>honed developing them at higher levels<br>reasons in terms of possibilities of<br>better career structures better job<br>opportunities but I think the most<br>important bit is just that you've now<br>for those of you who have just or are<br>just finishing your undergraduate career<br>you've now reached a point where you can<br>move into really thinking about the<br>topics and the disciplines that<br>Fascinate you some of you have already<br>started on that and I'm sure you've<br>found that there is quite a shift from<br>undergraduate study into postgraduate<br>study and it becomes in some ways more<br>enthralling as you go<br>on uh it's a wonderful opportunity to<br>take a discipline or a subject that<br>you've grown to really find interesting<br>and now have the skills and the<br>background to pursue it in depth um so I<br>really do hope that you will find a<br>place that you can do it if you're<br>looking for next year do have a look at<br>this<br>nice brochure with the uh frig Birds on<br>it um which gives a a quick indication<br>of the sort of post-graduate programs<br>you can do in the faculty there are<br>quite a lot of them that gives you some<br>indication of all of them the top ones<br>are The Bachelor of Arts the<br>undergraduate programs and then go on to<br>postgraduate if you're thinking about<br>this year then we can actually give you<br>the courses and information about the<br>courses in the postgraduate handbook but<br>often the best source of information is<br>actually to find your graduate advisor<br>from the area you want to work in pin<br>them down and actually ask them what you<br>can do and follow that through so lovely<br>to see you here I'll hand over to the<br>people who are going to give you some<br>more information and then we'll let you<br>go free and have a drink and find<br>someone to really talk to thank<br>you um hi um you're a lot of people bit<br>scary but all right um as Steve already<br>said is my main supervisor um as he<br>already said I'm from Austria I'm doing<br>a PhD at the department of sociology and<br>um my the degree system in Austria used<br>to work very differently than it does in<br>New Zealand and all over the world<br>pretty much so what I was looking for<br>once I had my degree from at home was um<br>to get a degree that actually recognized<br>internationally so could get a job um<br>and I wanted to get it from a good<br>University um that's all the<br>expectations I had pretty much um but<br>what I'm getting here is uh a lot more I<br>am meeting new people all the time<br>probably meet a lot of new people here<br>that haven't met so far from The Faculty<br>or students I also meet people from<br>different disciplines coming from<br>different backgrounds with different<br>experiences I am able to work as a tutor<br>this year I'm responsible for the<br>learning of 100 students um some<br>sometimes it seems like more of<br>them I've also contributed to the<br>research work of our head of department<br>and of other staff members it's quite a<br>pleasure to hear them mention your work<br>when they're presenting whatever they<br>came up with afterwards at a conference<br>and I have the luxury to read ridiculous<br>amounts um and it is a luxury because if<br>you're out in a workplace you usually<br>can't do that when you're starting out<br>on your undergraduate degree you're<br>learning the basics of your trade but as<br>a post-graduate student you actually<br>have a lot more intellectual Freedom you<br>get to choose your focus of interest of<br>the things you are interested in most<br>you can direct your research assignments<br>or your essay assignments to greater<br>extents than as an undergraduate student<br>um all the while knowing that if you<br>need help and support your<br>lecturers staff members will get give it<br>to<br>you all the time that I actually spent<br>here at Oakland University I noticed<br>that things are changing quite<br>considerably um of course students and<br>the university are faced with more<br>challenges and more so today with this<br>economic uncertainties that we don't<br>really grasp most of the<br>time um so education and the skills that<br>we develop and the knowledge we gain are<br>becoming more and more important but<br>also the university is faced with<br>challenges it needs to adapt to a<br>changing world to changing employment<br>situations it has to adapt the courses<br>the degrees but also the services they<br>offer to us and to me as a student um<br>the success as a student it's not just<br>about passing a paper or to hand in a<br>thesis and get a degree at the end but<br>also to be prepared for the world out<br>there and I have to say I did not really<br>get that from my previous degree but if<br>I look at the courses that the Student<br>Learning Center and also The Graduate<br>Center are offering it becomes quite<br>clear that actually these things do<br>matter here at ockland University we do<br>need skills not just academic skills but<br>also we need information on how does the<br>system actually work what can we do with<br>our degree particularly if you have an<br>arts degree which it's not always<br>apparent what we do afterwards so<br>courses at Student Learning Center and<br>Graduate Center and the library offer<br>are not just about academic skills when<br>I started out my degree um I took pretty<br>much everything that was offered library<br>and re uh The learningstem Learning<br>Center I took courses on mind mapping<br>which became very handy when I started<br>to write out my first chapter did a<br>course on speed reading which was at<br>times very depressing because it turned<br>out that I have a lot of reading habits<br>that actually really slow me down so I<br>was able to work on that improve there<br>but I also took part in courses that<br>were immediately helpful like on um end<br>node and also to get the most out of<br>word but that's not all of course other<br>courses they offer is really um<br>something of importance when it comes to<br>our careers for example um I attended<br>some courses seminar days<br>where people from within the university<br>were invited but also from outside the<br>University and they talked to us about<br>their experiences as re researchers and<br>they shared with us what the different<br>employers actually are looking in um<br>graduates from<br>universities so they inform us on what<br>we actually need to know about how<br>things work how do we get a job how do<br>we get<br>published<br>so if you are actually deciding to<br>continue with postgraduate studies I<br>encourage you to get involved in your<br>department it was very um important to<br>me to actually do join things in the<br>department not just work like tutoring<br>and being a research assistant but also<br>social matters um for example last we<br>year I organized a group of students we<br>also included undergraduate students to<br>shoot a documentary on child poverty in<br>New Zealand so it's not just again about<br>academic skills but social skills skills<br>and skills that you might need outside<br>of<br>University get to know your staff and<br>get them to know you because that might<br>open up quite a lot of opportunities not<br>just in the short term but also long<br>term um you might already be aware that<br>the postgraduate degree is not that<br>cheap particularly if you are an<br>international student but um there are a<br>lot of funding resources out there and<br>it's um might literally pay off for you<br>to go to the Scholarship office and talk<br>to somebody get their advice on<br>matters um another matter that should be<br>mentioned is the postgraduate Student<br>Association they are the people who<br>represent our um voice and our needs um<br>within the university system one thing I<br>really enjoy that um pgsa is organizing<br>every year is exposure it's where we<br>postgraduate students can actually<br>present our work that we're doing in our<br>offices all year long to people from<br>outside the department outside the<br>faculty and we actually can win quite<br>cool prizes another thing that pgsa is<br>doing is they're organizing cool parties<br>I think they had one just last week um<br>where there's free food cheap drinks and<br>good<br>music I would also like to remind you<br>that the more you talk to other people<br>um the better your chances are to sort<br>out what you want what the World outside<br>needs and how you get there I really<br>would like to remind you to talk to your<br>postgraduate adviser within the<br>department but also don't be afraid to<br>talk to your former tutors and also talk<br>to other post-graduate students within<br>your department just knock on their door<br>they might frown at you for a moment but<br>usually we're quite friendly so also<br>don't hesitate to talk to me as we<br>um I'm Steve's trusted well not so<br>trusted sidekick I'm the assistant Dean<br>student I'm also a historian so I work<br>in the uh Department of History here at<br>um<br>Oakland and um I really just want to say<br>I envy<br>you I was you once and<br>I envy the position you are in you have<br>a world of opportunities in front of you<br>you have the chance to study at an<br>advanced level at one of the world's<br>best<br>universities in subjects that are far<br>arranging they're groundbreaking they're<br>interesting and fascinating and one of<br>the reasons you're here of course is<br>because you've been inspired in part um<br>by those<br>factors most of you will have had these<br>subjects as undergraduate some of you as<br>um slightly more advanced<br>postgraduates and you have had the<br>chance to engage with people who are<br>experts in these<br>fields so I envy you because you know<br>have the<br>opportunity to delve into the wonderful<br>world of Academia not necessarily to<br>become an academic you could become like<br>St me or J or Jennifer um and do this<br>for a<br>living but also to really find out what<br>the nuts and bolts are of the discipline<br>you've chosen that you're interested<br>in and you get to do that by engaging<br>with us the experts in these fields in a<br>much smaller more intimate way than you<br>have in the past either with onetoone<br>guidance or in small group<br>teaching and in the process you can<br>become the<br>expert and yes this will open up job<br>opportunities and<br>careers but more importantly it will<br>heighten your powers critical thinking<br>juices and you'll benefit from the<br>guidance we give you we who cherish the<br>opportunity to turn you into our<br>colleagues or into our potential<br>colleagues of the<br>future so from my perspective why do<br>this well I've been in your shoes and<br>there's possibly four reasons I could<br>think of why you would want to go on and<br>study postgraduate level here well one<br>you could be very<br>pragmatic you need this degree to get<br>that job and in this credit crunch<br>crisis period it will really improve<br>your CV you may have the edge over<br>someone who's not as well educated as<br>you or who doesn't have their degree<br>from Oakland<br>University or you are driven you could<br>be<br>both you want to your knowledge base and<br>your skill base you want to develop<br>yourself<br>or you want to<br>excel you enjoy studying you thrive on<br>learning new things and reel in the<br>chance to do this at a much higher<br>level of course you could also be here<br>because you actually don't know what you<br>want to<br>do and this allows you to stay a student<br>just a little bit longer and not worry<br>there so even if you're in that last<br>category and maybe perhaps because or if<br>you are in that last<br>category take it from me education is<br>never<br>wasted and advancing your education will<br>open up a world of<br>choices and doors to Bright<br>Futures so as Dr Seuss says in his<br>famous book oh the Places You'll<br>Go and this is with thanks to my<br>four-year-old<br>son I read this to him the other day<br>congratulations to today is your day<br>you're off to great places you're off<br>and Away you have brains in your head<br>you have feet in your shoes you can<br>steer yourself any direction you<br>choose kid you'll move mountains so be<br>your name box Bor or bixie or Bray or<br>morai Ali on Allen or<br>Shay you're off to great places today is<br>your day your mountain is waiting so get<br>on your way so go find those postgrad<br>advisers that are lurking around go talk<br>to people with these things on and uh<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
