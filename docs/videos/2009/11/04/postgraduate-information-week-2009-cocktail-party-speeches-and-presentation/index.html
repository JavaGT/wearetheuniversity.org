Graduate Studies<br>it gives me particular pleasure to<br>welcome this evening all of you who are<br>postgraduate and prospective<br>postgraduate students welcome also to<br>our University staff and our three guest<br>speakers Professor Peter Gluckman Angus<br>Blair and Zoe<br>Wilson before I start I need to advise<br>you that we are filming this function<br>this evening and we will use this<br>footage on our website to promote<br>postgraduate study<br>I have been advised that if you do not<br>wish to be filmed or photographed then<br>could you please move out of shot and<br>alert the<br>cameraman I guess that means to say that<br>if you see a camera pointing in your<br>direction and you don't want to be<br>caught it's okay to<br>duck deciding whether to undertake<br>postgraduate study and where to study is<br>probably one of the most important<br>decisions that you will make that will<br>shape your life's Direction<br>in choosing to study at the University<br>of Oakland you are choosing to come and<br>study at one of the world's leading<br>teaching and research<br>universities as you know the University<br>of Oakland is ranked in the top 1% of<br>the times higher rankings and out of<br>7,000 universities<br>internationally oneir of New Zealand's<br>600 top ranked researchers are located<br>here at the University of of Oakland a<br>choice to be at a university with an<br>excellent reputation for the quality of<br>its staff isn't itself an excellent<br>decision we belong to two University<br>networks internationally University S21<br>and the association of Pacific Rim<br>universities<br>Andrew u21 is an international network<br>of invited research intensive<br>universities that Cooper operate towards<br>High institutional and educational and<br>outcomes and international<br>visibility appu is a Consortium of 37<br>universities located around the Pacific<br>Rim the University of Oakland also has<br>memoranda of understanding with over 120<br>universities<br>worldwide as New Zealand's Premier<br>Research Le University we have 40 units<br>and centers of research excellence and<br>we host four of the national centers of<br>research Excellence the cuse giving an<br>opportunity for postgraduate research<br>students to participate in leading<br>research the university provides a an<br>extensive package to support<br>postgraduate students including Masters<br>and doctoral<br>scholarships postgraduate research<br>student accounts for doctoral students<br>completion awards for those doctoral<br>students who complete their research<br>within 4<br>years domestic fee rates for<br>international doctoral students<br>assistance with<br>accommodation and lastly generous<br>funding for research provided through<br>the faculty research Development<br>Fund so why undertake postgraduate<br>courses or<br>research I believe it is about pursuing<br>your passion pursuing your interest in a<br>supportive environment in an excellent<br>institution that will help you achieve<br>your<br>dreams I would now like to say a few<br>words to those who are considering an<br>academic career there are significant<br>opportunities coming in the future with<br>the retirement of us baby boomers as we<br>move<br>on life as an academic offers a<br>stimulating environment in which to<br>undertake research and teaching in order<br>to grow knowledge challenge thinking and<br>work with exciting people who want to<br>make a better world and indeed it is<br>your opportunity to make your mark on<br>the<br>world I recommend that you undertake<br>your doctoral degree at the University<br>of Oakland and then consider<br>post-doctoral study<br>overseas our staff will be able to<br>assist you to find a post at one of our<br>partner universities inter<br>nationally and now to tell you about the<br>excitement of research and achieving<br>dreams I would like to introduce<br>distinguished Professor Peter gakman<br>professor of pediatric and perinatal<br>biology and director of The leens<br>Institute on Wednesday this week it was<br>announced that distinguished Professor<br>Peter Gman has been appointed by John<br>key as the first prime minister's chief<br>science<br>advisor his appointment to the role<br>reflects his distinguished research<br>career and contributions to the New<br>Zealand and international research and<br>scientific<br>Community he is a distinguished<br>companion of the New Zealand order of<br>Merit for service to medicine and in<br>2001 he was awarded the Rutherford medal<br>the top science award in New Zealand he<br>is a fellow of the Royal Society of<br>London<br>and the only New Zealander elected to<br>the Institute of Medicine of the<br>nationaly of Science in the United<br>States and the Academy of Medical<br>Sciences of Great Britain ladies and<br>Gentlemen please welcome distinguished<br>Gman thanks Gregor um I'm going to have<br>to focus my talk largely on science<br>students and because I know far more<br>about science than I do about the humity<br>so I apologize for those who see that<br>what I say has a slightly science<br>orientation there are three important<br>decisions you're going to make in your<br>life who you choose to live<br>with you're buying your<br>house and your graduate student<br>supervision and I mean that last one<br>very seriously I think that one of the<br>things that students don't realize is is<br>how much your supervisors will be your<br>mentors for the rest of your life if<br>they're a good<br>supervisor and even now and what<br>happened to me in the last week I was<br>talking to the person in San and<br>choosing to take that job I was talking<br>to the person who was my fellowship<br>supervisor in San Francisco 35 years ago<br>we still have that close relationship he<br>continues to be my mentor and the point<br>I want to make is that<br>your career is partly built on your own<br>capacities it's also built on whom you<br>know and the people who help you build<br>those networks are good<br>supervisors University of orland's full<br>of people who have good International<br>links who have high reputations in their<br>own regard and when you're choosing to<br>study I say to students first of all<br>choose the kind of person that you want<br>to work with who you want to be a<br>mentor who you feel is able to help your<br>career in time develop through networks<br>through relationships but in the<br>academic or in the private sector rather<br>than the experimental field the field<br>will come but remember if you're a<br>scientist 90% of what you do in your PhD<br>or your Master's in 10 year's time will<br>be irrelevant cu the science will have<br>be moved on and you'll be in a different<br>field of<br>endeavor just because the S the the the<br>the AO it sounds exciting it may not<br>necessarily be that will develop your<br>career<br>well now why undertake research well<br>there's many reasons to undertake<br>research but fundamentally whether<br>you're in the humanities or whether<br>you're in the<br>Sciences it's about using being able to<br>be creative because in fact<br>that's what research is it's a<br>manifestation of creative use of the<br>brain whether you're an artist or a<br>scientist fundamentally I think it's not<br>much different you're able to indulge in<br>your in using your own<br>imagination the problem is you're going<br>to find out is Masters and PhD research<br>is hard work you're going to go through<br>long periods of<br>disappointment every student go through<br>a period of negativity or to waste of<br>time I'm not getting<br>anywhere because research is about 90%<br>getting the question right getting the<br>experimental design right solving the<br>experimental problems and the design<br>problems and then in a<br>rush you get the results and then you're<br>excited and then the real research<br>starts and most students forget that<br>that's writing the research up not as a<br>thesis but in a form where other<br>academics can see it as scientific<br>papers cuz in the end of the day if<br>you're a scientist it's not the thesis<br>that counts I hate to say it but only<br>two people are going to read your thesis<br>your mother and the examiner it's the<br>scientific papers that they will read<br>and which your career will be built<br>around now I'm not going to dwell on my<br>own research in any great detail except<br>I can't think of anything else that's<br>given me more pleasure over many years<br>than seeing young people come into my<br>lab or the lab in The Institute struggle<br>to try and find what to make sense of<br>what they're trying to do go inevitably<br>through a period of depression cuz it's<br>not working then come out the other end<br>to find that theyve made a real<br>contribution in many ways to the biology<br>of improving The Human Condition and<br>then go off to make their own careers we<br>have students who are now professors in<br>this University we have had students who<br>are now in very distinguished positions<br>in drug companies around the world we<br>have students who who've uh gone to very<br>prestigious universities all around the<br>world as fellows and now faculty<br>members I'm not going to dwell on the<br>liens Institute<br>because that's not my function tonight<br>except to say what we've tried to do in<br>The Institute which is a medical<br>research institute focused on the issues<br>around a poor start to life is create a<br>very special environment most research<br>institutes focus on that just molecular<br>biology or they're just cancer research<br>or something like that what we've tried<br>to do is create a multidisiplinary<br>environment from mathematical biology<br>through to Public Health and economics<br>research with a lot of molecular<br>cellular and human biology in<br>between and I say that cuz I think one<br>of the beauties of this University is<br>it's a very complete University and I<br>think one of the strengths of New<br>Zealand<br>science which is not possible in<br>countries like the United States and<br>United Kingdom is you can undertake<br>interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary<br>study small countries enable a<br>physiologist to talk to an engineer an<br>engineer to talk to a chemist it's not<br>so easy in big in big countries for that<br>kind of funding to occur and as a result<br>of that there's far more<br>interdisciplinary activity in this<br>University than in most universities and<br>as interdisciplinary activity is the way<br>science is going I think those of you<br>who' have chosen to do science or<br>medical research or engineering studies<br>in this University are well placed to<br>the Future so<br>I thank you for coming this evening I<br>probably should now make a declaration<br>that I'm not speaking on behalf of the<br>Prime Minister tonight as a member of<br>the University I've got to get used to<br>all these conflicts of interest but<br>thank you very much and please enjoy the<br>university are all the students enjoying<br>the free drinks<br>tonight really good way to start the<br>evening I think Friday<br>night I'm not going to lie my favorite<br>thing about these events is that I get<br>to come dressed up because as a<br>postgraduate student I don't have to<br>wear a tie of work every day which is a<br>fantastic experience for anyone who<br>spend some time in the workforce so<br>excuse me if I've overdone it a little<br>bit tonight now um I'm a fifth year<br>student I'm a master student and it's my<br>second year at the University of Oakland<br>business school I actually graduated<br>from Massie University a couple of years<br>ago and decided to come to Oakland um<br>not just for a change but also for the<br>increased challenges and a few more<br>opportunities to come my way as<br>well now um when I was given this gig I<br>was actually told there were five things<br>that I should probably talk about and<br>one of those things was the research I<br>did but you see the first lesson that I<br>learned when I got to postgraduate<br>studies was that you should generally<br>avoid talking about exactly what it is<br>that you research on other than with<br>those people that you spend time with so<br>people would normally come up to me and<br>say well what do you studying tell me<br>about your mass<br>thesis me I look at leadership<br>perspective drawing on the sociology of<br>culture by giving attention towards<br>elevating leadership as a strategic and<br>moral imperative which tempers the<br>predominance or soci psychological<br>accounts of leadership and raises<br>questions about the links between<br>structure that sounds interesting I<br>know but pretty soon I realized that<br>everyone thought my work sounded<br>interesting as quite reminiscent of when<br>my mother used to found my healthy<br>prisent interest in transforming robots<br>interesting as<br>well but as with all things worth doing<br>you generally get a lot more than you<br>bargain for and your postgraduate<br>experience is going to be no exception<br>to that the thesis that you actually<br>study as has been pointed out is going<br>to be an exceptionally small part of the<br>overall learning experience it certainly<br>has been for<br>me now the first lesson I got After<br>figuring out that people didn't actually<br>want to hear about the details of<br>organizational discourse surrounding<br>culture culture construction emerges and<br>acquisition was that I didn't work<br>anywhere near hard enough during my<br>undergraduate<br>experience so does anyone here remember<br>what it was like in your first year of<br>University when you looked back at your<br>high school days and you're like 9 to 3<br>I could have been doing so much more<br>what was I doing with all my<br>time I've got some bad news for you all<br>it pretty much feels exactly the same<br>when you get the postgraduate experience<br>and I look back at what I was doing<br>during my undergrad years and went wow I<br>really could have been making a lot more<br>of that<br>cuz for a second I just want I want<br>everyone to think about the intellectual<br>transformation that has been the last 3<br>to four years for for the students<br>anyway and I want you to realize that<br>that intellectual transformation is<br>really just the first step in a long way<br>and that this next one year let alone<br>the next three you'll see just as large<br>a change in the Way You observe the<br>world and the way you make sense of<br>things around you so you're just on the<br>first<br>step one of my heroes said that we<br>should all try to look for smart people<br>and hard problems now these smart people<br>tend to always Clump together so when<br>you find one of these clumps it's<br>usually a good idea to Joy it join it<br>and postgrad experience has definitely<br>been one of those clumps for me the<br>second part of his advice is that we<br>should all try and find hard problems<br>cuz they're generally the ones worth<br>working on and the ones that draw the<br>most<br>satisfaction now reading research is<br>easy writing research is hard so it's<br>generally pretty easy to see which one<br>of these is going to be the more<br>term the final thought I'd like to leave<br>all the undergraduate students here<br>tonight is that someone has picked you<br>to be here there's a person in your<br>faculty who thinks that you are better<br>than you think you are now that person's<br>probably a lot smarter than you are so<br>I'm going to take their word on it and<br>you should<br>too cuz there are so many people in this<br>so few people in this world today that<br>are willing to challenge the way things<br>are done to break new ground make a<br>difference and do something a little<br>less<br>conventional so I don't want you to take<br>postgraduate studies because you don't<br>know what you want to do with your life<br>so that may be the case as well and<br>whether you're an idealist who wants to<br>change the world or pragmatist who just<br>wants to be a bit better at what he does<br>or if he does have a crazy intellectual<br>itch that needs to be scratched consider<br>joining me for postgraduate studies next<br>year and I promise you won't forget it<br>Professor<br>Coster<br>yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
