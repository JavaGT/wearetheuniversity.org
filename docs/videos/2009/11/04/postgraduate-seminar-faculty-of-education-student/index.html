an<br>hour first month of studying in the<br>Graduate Diploma of primary prior to<br>this I have done two degrees I did a BA<br>and anthropology social anthropology and<br>English literature and I did an honours<br>degree in museums and cultural heritage<br>last year was employed at the oakland<br>museum as pacifica educator and i<br>decided with all of the exciting events<br>that you might have read about on the<br>front page of The Herald and the<br>economic situation of our great nation i<br>decided that i'm teaching was something<br>that I wanted to pursue now experiences<br>on the course have been challenging this<br>time last year I attended a day similar<br>to this and I had people I heard Jean<br>say that the course load was<br>considerable and she was right she's an<br>honest woman and most certainly at des<br>intensive it's a different kind of work<br>to be a studies and one thing that<br>shocked my system was under 8 30 start<br>and then often having the lectures later<br>into the night we have a rich and varied<br>experience because of the seven<br>curriculum areas that we're studying one<br>thing that I've definitely noticed is<br>that you can't shy away from what you<br>don't like like I did in my BA and you<br>have to be ready to walk into a<br>situation and think with this time next<br>year I'm going to be having and 60 pairs<br>of eyes I'm sitting in front of me in my<br>classroom and I need to have the<br>confidence to be able to teach that and<br>I'm from in my role at the Museum I had<br>taught them only culture and history of<br>the Pacific so there is something that<br>I've had to really and push myself<br>towards when the learning communities<br>that happen that are created at Epsom<br>are really strong I've met some really<br>inspiring people who have been at the<br>forefront of<br>new curriculum and people who expert in<br>the areas are really really essential to<br>know I think to enrich your experience<br>as a student and one thing that has<br>they're both the manner and I have /<br>taken in I'm not making words up as I go<br>and as that we're both student reps I<br>was nominated in my absence and came<br>back the next day and valid that I was a<br>student rip and that's something that<br>I've never done before but what that's<br>meant for me as being in charge of the<br> effeminate honor of our of our own<br>stream we've got 35 people we've got<br>seven international students so one of<br>the most interesting things we've done<br>so far as an activity where we've had to<br>explain what's cons were you try telling<br>someone at teaching an adult that has<br>come from Egypt and english as their<br>fourth language also we have started our<br>own teddy or group and we're working our<br>stream that's our learning group so<br>that's the 36 students we're working<br>towards painting our own normalizes that<br>this is all co-curricular activities<br>it's not necessarily at relate to the<br>curriculum but the sub is something<br>we're doing live our own accord and the<br>whole the entire and graduate diploma<br>and primary is looking to attend and<br>Mohamed I at our local Ealing naughty<br>fatalism that item item Athena and all<br>ok so what we every day we walk into a<br>context we were with people who are in<br>search of social justice the people who<br>are motivated the people who want to be<br>there and they're people who are said<br>I'm making a change so I encourage you<br>towards this course I chose this course<br>above any other because I went out into<br>schools and asked them which are the<br>best graduates and whether they come<br>from<br>all right Kyoto koto good evening<br>everybody and my name is Amanda Kennedy<br>I'll just talk a little bit about why I<br>decided to do a little bit about my<br>experience and have a chat about<br>practicum and my academic background is<br>environmental science in English and the<br>last few years I've spent teaching<br>overseas and that's pretty much where<br>and when I fell in love with the<br>profession I came back pretty desperate<br>to dirt I did have a part time job at<br>first as these lovely ladies have<br>pointed out that's really tough if you<br>really have to work part-time keep it<br>short and trang keep your are<br>splitsville yeah this course is for you<br>if you don't like free time a lot and<br>that's for sure and a lot of people on<br>the course are doing it because it's as<br>people point out it's pretty much<br>recession proof and a lot of people this<br>year have talked about that as being one<br>of their highest motivations and my<br>owner a little more idealistic I think<br>than that it's something that's<br>different every day and you see that<br>from the moment you go out and practicum<br>every day is different every day is<br>something unexpected and it's just so<br>much fun and practicum is such a buzz<br>hectic m is great fun you you start out<br>within two weeks of starting the quarter<br>suit in the classroom so then the right<br>from the beginning you get a real feel<br>of whether or not this as V 0 which is<br>really good as well because you can't<br>get a refund at that stage yeah and so<br>if you enjoy the practicum and you want<br>to keep going and then you do the<br>tuesdays and skills which is a really<br>good way to get a in my dear of how<br>schools function overhaul scuze me over<br>the whole year and you sort of its<br>snapshots of how it goes as well as the<br>block practicum this for you and you're<br>in a class over a period of you know a<br>few weeks with your teacher and there is<br>I can't sort of talk highly enough of<br>that experience at<br>just it's really fantastic to be in the<br>classroom with a teacher who's there to<br>support you and guide you you get to see<br>a whole lot of different teachers and<br>different teaching styles and context<br>you get to go to Heidi salesgirls Lotus<br>our skills you can get a feel for what<br>kind of teaching you want to do as well<br>which is really good you can ask the<br>teachers any kind of questions you have<br>and its really hands-on so you're<br>teaching right from day one they really<br>encourage you to get second so if you're<br>nervous about being in front of the<br>classic heads that just goes straight<br>away pretty much that's great and if it<br>doesn't go you're in trouble because<br>there's a lot of practicum witness yeah<br>and it's good for just giving it you<br>know but a familiarity with the school<br>processes and things and that's all I'm<br>pretty much have to say I highly<br>recommend for saturday hi everyone my<br>name is Natasha Falconer I didn't always<br>want to be a teacher I I always thought<br>odd I'm on to teaching you know that's<br>the thing you do if he can't now make it<br>in your chosen career well my chosen<br>guru was acting time it to drum school<br>and I was going to be a Hollywood movie<br>star but by the time I was 20 and I<br>realized it probably wasn't going to<br>happen and maybe there was a little part<br>of me that didn't really want that<br>anyway so I went back to my no deepest<br>kind of motivating factor of why I<br>wanted to be an actor and I realized<br>that it was about giving a part of me<br>back and i graduated in 2007 and I spent<br>a year acting then plays and short films<br>and but a costume here in there and I<br>don't think you know I've gone to<br>education because we're going into<br>recession in the acting industry<br>everyone's in whom<br>precision I need two percent of people<br>who put their put their job down as an<br>actor in 2007 into over fifty thousand<br>dollars and also that year the guy who<br>won New Zealand's best top actor award<br>only twenty-one thousand dollars so i<br>figured that if I became a teacher that<br>would be a step up for me and yeah so<br>there was a huge decision making process<br>involved which I'm sure some people that<br>there might be going through a similar<br>kind of thing you know making a huge<br>paradigm shift reaching up all of your<br>beliefs about who you were what you're<br>going to be doing in moving them into<br>the new paradigm which is what I did it<br>took a lot of hard work and a lot of<br>disciplining myself to you know look at<br>myself and say no I'm not off paying<br>yeah I do my chosen career I actually<br>just wanted to do something a little bit<br>different i didn't want to climb to the<br>top of my heap i wanted to expand read<br>twice and give and be in a much more<br>nurturing field then I felt that I was<br>in so I'm really happy to be on this<br>program it's really as really tough i<br>found that but I've also found that the<br>lecturers are the area Regina's I've<br>never been turned away and I've knocked<br>on a door to ask questions of always<br>being there they've always often<br>themselves time of their own accord to<br>help on assignments and and I feel very<br>thanks i'm representing the baby boomers<br>here for interview and mums and dads to<br>their over 50 have good onya listen so<br>i've i've had my stripes torn off and my<br>sword broke across with me several times<br>through my life so changing careers<br>there's something that I've been doing<br>every sort of 10 years or so but this<br>one was is obviously a little different<br>and it has been a bit different it's<br>been a long time coming and I've spoken<br>to a lot of people and some sort of<br>inspirational people that that inspired<br>me that took it up a bit later in life<br>in suit it was great fun and I have to<br>say that the course compared to working<br>for yourself in the construction and<br>architecture business passing around for<br>jobs and money that causes a breeze you<br>know but I just like I say that a lot<br>too loud and obviously it is an intense<br>course but a different sort of intensity<br>and it's very nice the delivery is<br>really quite nice lots of time look so<br>similar concepts over and over again so<br>we start the second because there's a<br>get older it does take a bit longer for<br>the subcircuit I would have to say um so<br>practicum and yeah so my first port of<br>call is one tree hill college one tree<br>hill college for those of the Oakland as<br>a bit like the prince song the college<br>formerly known as pedo SI and I spend a<br>lot of time in my school years I went to<br>school at Edgewood College and Pakuranga<br>fashion guys from Penrose college<br>because that was what we did when we<br>went to play Penrose tamaki or any of<br>those guys I had a bunch of merry mates<br>at my school who looked out about for me<br>and I was the typical smart smart guy<br>that stir things up so we had great<br>rivalry and it's really quite fun to go<br>back there and see see what it was like<br>and it's had a huge revolution so this<br>is a incredibly diverse school this OP<br>three so reasonably low socio-economic<br>group<br>very high percentage of Indian Fijian<br>Indian I believe through small Park our<br>population other makeup is probably<br>mainly p I and Maori so that was really<br>fun to me off of my yard and up down<br>with some of the rental that go to<br>school on Waunakee and it was a similar<br>sort of Bachelor business free-spirited<br>kids very dynamic cos you ever don't<br>ever kids and really good fun a lot of<br>people was all know watch this is big PR<br>guys though bastian this there the other<br>and I tell you what I've had nothing but<br>good positive so there's been no no drum<br>as far as it goes it's the biggest<br>drowner than i had on first two weeks<br>was on the third false fire alarm all<br>the kids came running outside mr. miss<br>dad's a real fire on Julie's zip<br>tin and down jumped into the building<br>bring a bar and extinguished up with my<br>but I guess one of the things with it<br>with a school such as my small schools<br>that have got 900 kids it's really quite<br>bismuth small the power was over four or<br>five and then apartment you sort of hook<br>straight anywhere with those people and<br>apart from a bit of flitting around I<br>really got to see how school works how<br>have those ins and outs and our<br>intensive all places from 8 15 in the<br>morning to when every everybody goes<br>it's all happening so long its feet in<br>your face but your spin label and been<br>thrown in a little bit this week was<br>there and hip and my session teachers<br>it's still service being raped was up in<br>some debris leaf blown apart from the<br>relieving teachers who legally required<br>to sit there and be bored but I spent<br>many years in the service industry and a<br>lot of things actually is a nest year<br>and I would have to say that apart from<br>the big pants and manian copious amounts<br>of alcohol there is quite similarity and<br>let me explain further to the<br>estrangement there's a similarity and<br>close to be they've been in the service<br>industry and you ignore and you've got<br>eyes on you the whole time goddammit I'm<br>can readjust your clothing without<br>somebody noticing analyst asleep so it<br>is quite intense but this is a different<br>being awarded so we'll see how the next<br>breath can compares with possibly hide<br>this old school with a different country<br>kids about that I i must say i do like<br>and lessons i am still one will just<br>trapped in an otherwise body and i<br>really enjoyed there in your face and<br>you had to put up and/or be quite so for<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
