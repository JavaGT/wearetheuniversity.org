welcome to um p714 today um<br>science technology media and God uh this<br>week we're continuing our look at New<br>Media and uh we're moving on from sort<br>of a general discussion as to what that<br>was and how that related to our sort of<br>Investigation of religion and Technology<br>before through to actually thinking<br>about uh the topic of online religion or<br>whether or not that's even a possibility<br>or or how it might be manifest in<br>different sorts of ways and things like<br>that so at the start what I wanted to do<br>was uh just throw a few ideas on the<br>board here when you hear the terms<br>religion online or online religion you<br>know what are some of the sorts of<br>things that you know immediately spring<br>to mind for some of you that may be<br>nothing but for others of you may have a<br>whole lot of different experiences or<br>things you thought about so what might<br>some of those things<br>be there's a<br>distinction there's a distinction<br>between online religion and religion<br>online okay so online religion and<br>religion online are perhaps different<br>so that might be a question is there a<br>difference between the terminology<br>that's used uh in the literature that<br>discusses that or when people talk about<br>it but on a more mundane level what are<br>some of the things that you know might<br>spring to mind if someone says to you<br>they had an experience of religion<br>online what might that look like or<br>online<br>religion that might be virtual Cathedral<br>theal Cathedral say where they have an<br>experience of a a full liturgy over the<br>Internet yeah I actually experience<br>seems to work for quite a number of<br>people okay yeah so that's that's one<br>example that in uh a interactive virtual<br>environment like second life um people<br>have set up what might be considered<br>sacred spaces that people using the<br>software and internet connection can<br>either go individually or meet with<br>others and engage in some sort of<br>spiritual ritual or practice or<br>something like that so let's just uh pop<br>board what else might we<br>have oh like online pre networks so an<br>online pre Network so so people what<br>would post in prayer requests and then<br>other people would read it or they'd<br>post it to someone who's a professional<br>prayer um both I would think yeah um<br>which is quite an interesting concept<br>it's like a Blog in some ways okay so so<br>a prayer blog so people can can post<br>prayer requests in fact there was one of<br>those set up in the last couple of weeks<br>in New Zealand uh using Twitter so that<br>people could text in uh prayer requests<br>from wh<br>and then they would go up on the Twitter<br>feed and whoever was following the<br>Twitter feed could then sort of randomly<br>pray those things as they turned up so<br>things Church websites okay Church<br>websites various<br>denominational okay so religious<br>institutions religious organizations you<br>know they they may be Christian churches<br>or they may be uh something like um<br>islam.nu institutional websites that<br>represent the bricks and mortar<br>institution somehow in cyers space and<br>so that can be from the the top sort of<br>denomination type thing so you have<br>obviously have you know the Vatican<br>website or you might have the Anglican<br>Church in New Zealand's website or you<br>might have dicese might have a website<br>or uh a local religious community or<br>Church community might have a personal<br>smaller website as well so that's thing<br>need yeah so and there may be<br>differences between a set of websites<br>that fall within a particular religious<br>tradition you know so they fall within<br>the broad Christian tradition or they<br>fall within the Widder sort of Buddhist<br>tradition and then there are those who<br>are articulating a particular<br>institution or organization within that<br>uh as well so what other things one of<br>the other things that was in the<br>newspaper a couple of years back was um<br>mobile phones having sermons or uh<br>Church notices and things just zap to<br>your phone every week or several times a<br>day so that you could keep up with what<br>was happening um as well so mobile<br>Communications might be another one<br>hearing sermon sorry hearing sermon<br>hearing sermons yes uh you<br>know yeah there YouTube yeah okay so<br>yeah something like YouTube allows<br>people to uh record a sermon uh that<br>might be preached or a message it can<br>then be uh downloaded at a later date or<br>viewed at a later date and certainly um<br>in terms of sermon say through<br>podcasting through being able to<br>subscribe to a an an Internet site or<br>subscribe to an internet service that<br>regularly delivers uh audio or video and<br>audio messages to you you know for<br>watching on your mp3 player or listening<br>to on the train or something like that<br>yeah that's an extremely uh common way<br>in which people might encounter religion<br>online if they're encountering it in<br>some<br>form okay well those are all good ideas<br>and we'll come across some of those as<br>we go through the class today um but<br>just to yourselves thinking about the<br>idea that uh religion online or online<br>religion is both a mixture of people<br>just sort of putting information out<br>there and also people actually engaging<br>in spiritual practices like prayer or<br>something using the online environment<br>somehow the online environment mediates<br>a spiritual experience or a religious<br>structure as well as just having<br>religious ideas out there uh in the<br>online World okay now I've got here um a<br>couple of<br>images uh just for you to think about as<br>we're coming on uh the IOD one comes off<br>a a Church website you know in the<br>Oakland area um they have a website that<br>you can go to and you can download<br>sermons uh you can download uh you know<br>text messages other things that are<br>happening it's all sort of based around<br>you know having a an interactive web<br>face ing front to their Church community<br>uh branded in a way that uh is similar<br>in its branding to the way in which<br>technological products are are branded<br>and<br>marketed<br>silhouette ah but the screen that was<br>the god image on the screen you<br>see yes yes and that's and that's an<br>interesting interesting point raised<br>there is that in this online religion<br>religion online uh what are the images<br>used to portray<br>um the religion that we find there and a<br>lot of the religious images particularly<br>if they done in that sort of style um<br>yeah don't tend to be female images but<br>do tend to be a male image yeah as well<br>so that's something you can say well is<br>online religion actually reinforcing<br>particular gender roles or gender<br>stereotypes and that's a question to<br>bear at the back of your mind um and the<br>other picture here um the you can see um<br>the woman meditating with the laptop in<br>front of her that comes from a project<br>called The Wild Divine project which is<br>software you can buy that comes with a<br>biof feedback device you put on your<br>hand and depending on how you go through<br>the different Eastern meditation uh<br>rituals and things like that it provides<br>biof feedback that registers with the<br>software and so you can engage and do<br>things in this interactive environment<br>uh as you develop your own sort of<br>spiritual and personal well-being<br>through interacting with digital<br>technology so it's a real fusion of both<br>Eastern mysticism with sort of Western<br>uh sort of technological mentality as<br>well and bring fusing the two together<br>in a in an interesting sort of way um I<br>don't know if it's available in New<br>Zealand or not and if someone has it I'd<br>like to have it play sometime and see<br>what it looks like but um certainly you<br>know it's sort of the spiritual<br>equivalent of a Nintendo Wii or<br>something like that but yeah anyway so<br>in today's lecture um first up we've<br>just got a few of those ideas out there<br>we're going to look back just for just<br>to recap a little bit on where we've<br>been and how we've got to this point um<br>and then we're going to have a little<br>bit of a look at looking at this idea of<br>believing but not belonging in religious<br>communities because it's one thing we<br>can talk about online religion and I can<br>show you a zillion YouTube clips and<br>websites and all the gwiz features and<br>stuff like that but this we'll try and<br>frame it within a context of the<br>changing religious landscape<br>particularly within New Zealand uh but<br>you know across the world and how<br>different communities are using the<br>online sort of world to address that and<br>engage with that uh as they also facing<br>you know how their physical communities<br>are changing in structure and age and uh<br>people's commitment to them as well um<br>and then we look at that difference that<br>was raised between online religion and<br>religion online and then uh some of the<br>tensions and questions that arise out of<br>this you know who is being excluded who<br>is being embraced um are there<br>particular say within the Christian<br>tradition are there particular<br>theological distinctives that are being<br>uh marginalized or wrestled with so in<br>the Christian tradition in particular<br>the idea of incarnation is you know<br>Central to the faith and its broad sort<br>of History the idea that God would<br>become flesh and blood move into the<br>neighborhood and the true revelation of<br>God comes through the physical Flesh and<br>Blood person of Jesus Christ and<br>Christ's birth death resurrection and<br>coming again and so how in an online<br>world where we almost have a sense of<br>excarnation of leaving the body behind<br>to enter some other sort of world you<br>know are there irreconcilable tensions<br>with uh something like the Christian<br>thing okay so going back to our uh the<br>last few weeks we came through we um we<br>started off thinking that technology is<br>not just things but it's also ideas it's<br>also the sociopolitical systems and<br>things that we find ourselves in and<br>technology is very much our environment<br>it's the it's the sense of being almost<br>wrapped in media uh that sense that<br>technology is so much around us that<br>it's like the air that we breathe and<br>it's very hard to think critically about<br>it so that was one of those ideas that<br>we teased out a little bit and then we<br>talked about those three sort of key<br>responses to technology in general but<br>also particularly within religious<br>communities so technology is firstly uh<br>an oppressor that for all the good<br>things it brings it always brings more<br>more harm than good uh and that somehow<br>it shapes our lives in negative ways and<br>directs us into ways in which will<br>ultimately not be lifegiving so that's<br>the negative the pessimistic sort of<br>approach and on the other hand there was<br>the optimistic approach that uh<br>particularly within religious sort of<br>ideas that technology and human reason<br>and rationality Were Somehow possessed<br>by human beings to change the world to<br>be a better place and so technology is a<br>way in which God's grace perhaps is<br>manifested in the world through human<br>agency and so we can cure disease we can<br>uh establish you know um houses that are<br>leak proof uh we can wear clothes to<br>keep us warm uh and we can communicate<br>with people around the world and that's<br>a wonderful thing and and it shows God's<br>divine grace in the world somehow and<br>then there's the middle category perhaps<br>where technology is an instrument and it<br>matters not so much what it is but how<br>it's used and we talked about how though<br>that there's sort of an ambiguity in<br>that in that in order for a particular<br>technology or Technologies to be<br>developed uh certain values in the<br>community that produce them have to be<br>manifest and so it's not necessarily<br>neutral while there is sort of that the<br>ethical debate on how to use it as well<br>the fact that certain technology exists<br>might already show that there are<br>certain ethical values present uh in the<br>community as well and then that whole<br>idea that technology perhaps at least<br>within uh the Christian tradition has<br>has adopted coming out of that sort of<br>optimistic thing narratives of purpose<br>and of novelty that human beings are<br>sometimes described as co-agents or<br>co-creators with God there to somehow<br>reshape the world uh and in sort of<br>accordance with Divine purposes if they<br>can be divined um and also um somehow to<br>inject something new and novel into the<br>world as well and those two uh two<br>narratives can be found stretching<br>through the technological Community<br>purpos to overcome a problem novelty<br>because let's do something cool and new<br>and we'll find out something maybe at<br>the end of doing that um as well and<br>then that led us on to thinking about<br>the idea of the cyborg that you know<br>Humans Beings and Human Society the<br>boundaries between what is say inorganic<br>and organic is blurring or between<br>machine and human or the fact that we<br>have become colonized by technology and<br>our identity might be defined by the<br>technology that we use as well and our<br>perception of who we are stretches out<br>too you know to the end of our pen or to<br>the end of our cell phone or uh that's<br>very much a cultural sort of idea of<br>doing<br>thatle technology is just an extension<br>of yeah yeah certainly it is that you're<br>not limited by the physicality of the<br>body you know that you can transcend<br>yourself and extend yourself not just<br>through physical augmentation like a a<br>pace maker or or glasses or something<br>but that you know something like an<br>email connection or or a cell phone or<br>something like that extends you to the<br>location that that email or<br>communication is going to um and it<br>changes and if you go out without your<br>phone you feel somehow naked perhaps<br>that you know you've left your cell<br>phone behind oh you know I'm feeling a<br>little bit less than perhaps I was so<br>there's a dependency on technology as<br>well and then that last comment on New<br>Media and the shifting of authority so<br>we started to think about how in the<br>Reformation times in the Protestant<br>Reformation the idea that the individual<br>and God could engage in a relationship<br>without a priest having to be a mediator<br>the priesthood of all believers sort of<br>idea might be similar in some ways to<br>how people are describing how we engage<br>with information and media no longer<br>needing a media producer in the middle<br>to mediate information to us but rather<br>we can produce YouTube videos or blogs<br>or websites and create content directly<br>and cut out the middleman uh in a sense<br>and that changes the Dynamics of you<br>know how Society is structured in some<br>reality<br>holograph well yes yes a holographic<br>class that would be an interesting type<br>of thing and then we came up with those<br>tensions um too where um this this is<br>coming out of sort of the<br>anthropological work the ethnograph<br>ethnography that's being done on things<br>like YouTube that on one hand we want to<br>express our individualism we want to<br>express uh Independence and yet at the<br>same time we value Community we value<br>relationships we value authenticity<br>which in a in an environment that's<br>mediated uh by technology in environment<br>like YouTube or what actually is<br>authentic human behavior and identity in<br>that environment uh you know so is<br>someone uh being genuinely communicating<br>who they are um in an online environment<br>uh without you being able to register<br>things like body language without you<br>being able to register things like um<br>the tone of voice perhaps and even with<br>things like videos you know is that<br>really what they mean or what they say<br>or are they just pretending that and<br>just you know as a Persona that's<br>portrayed to the public as well and so<br>this idea that perhaps connection um<br>might equal some sort of con if I form<br>these in-depth and authentic<br>relationships somehow that's going to<br>constrain me uh in my behavior and<br>things like that or um perhaps they free<br>you up for connection without constraint<br>which led into the idea of um believing<br>without belonging so you might<br>remain connected to a religious<br>Authority a religious institution um and<br>you might continue to believe them the<br>particular values and the ideas within<br>that religious community but you don't<br>necessarily actually attend anymore you<br>don't actually encounter the same Flesh<br>and Blood people week to week to week<br>because you haven't actually committed<br>to a going to a physical location<br>perhaps or you shop around you know this<br>is the the church this is the religious<br>community that I'm involved with at the<br>moment because it suits me um but<br>tonight I'm going somewhere else to get<br>something else for me or you know it's<br>like Supermarket shopping or or that<br>sort of thing or pick and mix<br>spirituality uh consumer spirituality so<br>you have this idea perhaps of believing<br>but not belonging um and so that raises<br>questions about you know uh at least<br>within religious communities to do with<br>spiritual disciplines um and the way in<br>which uh people work together through<br>the hard times as well as the as the<br>easy times as well and so then that asks<br>you know leads into questions about you<br>know how does uh these sorts of<br>questions these sorts of things how do<br>they actually impinge upon religious<br>belief uh you know people are obviously<br>believing uh a lot of the same stuff but<br>not necessarily committing to<br>traditional communities or perhaps<br>committing to new communities and how<br>does that manifest its way out in the<br>online<br>world now on the uh question of<br>believing without belonging um Kevin<br>Ward A New Zealand Theologian uh did<br>some work on this uh in the past few<br>years um and he looked particularly at<br>things like church membership in New<br>Zealand uh so so this will be sort of<br>our background to where we're going and<br>this idea that um you know sort of two<br>two camps about why people were no<br>longer uh either joining churches or the<br>church was in Decline and numerically in<br>some way at least in institutional<br>Christian churches and um you know the<br>the argument came down sort of into into<br>two sort of camps one is that um you<br>know as the the process of modernization<br>continued through the 20th century<br>people found less and less reasons<br>actually to uh believe in the things<br>religious uh and so under the pressure<br>of secularization the church was no<br>longer relevant and they drifted away um<br>and the other camp that said well<br>actually people still keep believing<br>these ideas uh but they just chose to<br>stop belonging to those Institutions and<br>he cites the example um that he found in<br>his not just in religious institutions<br>but other institutions like<br>Athletics clubs he said you know uh<br>there were very fewer and fewer people<br>particularly older people joining um the<br>running clubs the jogging clubs and<br>things like that um but it wasn't that<br>people had stopped running and stopped<br>enjoying it because he still saw the<br>same number of people actually running<br>around hegley Park or wherever it was<br>that he was watching and that when they<br>had Round The Bays runs and when they<br>had other sorts of things um suddenly<br>thousands of people who really enjoyed<br>running and did running turned up up but<br>they no longer belong to clubs which<br>traditionally they would have done to do<br>it so they believed without belonging<br>and he said so that's a it's a it's an<br>interesting thing happening with<br>volunteer organizations and things like<br>that sports clubs and things across New<br>Zealand as well as churches this idea<br>that that the values are continued to be<br>held but the lifestyle and changes in<br>society perhaps argue against committing<br>longterm to particular<br>institutions be interesting to know how<br>much the Sunday shopping and Saturday<br>especially Sunday shopping and impact on<br>that where the church numbers<br>drastically changed once they Sunday<br>shopping yeah certainly the the 7 day 24<br>hours a day or active doing things might<br>be part of it um you know there's very<br>little time to actually do it and you<br>start to see that and that's one of the<br>things we look at but but we start to<br>see that that communities and and<br>religious communities in particular<br>start to change so they'll hold a church<br>service at 4:30 on Sunday afternoon or<br>on Wednesday evenings or something like<br>that to cater for people who are<br>involved in the retail industry and you<br>know have their weekends now totally<br>taken up by servicing um that particular<br>industry so that's a that's an attempt<br>to to change how things are done in<br>order to respond to a circumstance but<br>it may also be that there is just a you<br>know a societal<br>lack of commitment or wanting to commit<br>longterm to something that is actually a<br>cultural Trend um as<br>well okay and and it may also be too<br>that um because one of the other camps<br>too is that while people keep believing<br>but perhaps not belonging the ways in<br>which they express those beliefs have<br>changed so they may value certain things<br>but no longer go to a a Sunday church<br>service but they may meet with their<br>friends in their house one night a week<br>who hold similar values share a meal and<br>uh effectively that functions like<br>church so the rituals changed the the<br>the the Liturgy the ritual the the the<br>actual connection they're still<br>committed to something but um it's still<br>there buried away at the background and<br>so you know<br>that's that filters through<br>into you know the various statistics and<br>things like that so<br>uh the international social science<br>survey which has just been completed<br>which surveyed religion in 2008 around<br>the world and in New Zealand you know<br>said you know 50% of people believe in<br>God okay and 20% believe in a in a<br>higher power of some sort but not<br>necessarily a personal God so that's 70%<br>of people who still have some sort of<br>religious sort of thing happening at the<br>back of you know their thoughts perhaps<br>some time to time and things like that<br>and the 30% are agnostic or atheistic um<br>but when you actually see that in terms<br>of commitment to attending a regular<br>religious say service or something like<br>that uh that's dropped down to you know<br>between 10 and 20% depending on which<br>survey you go to which and and regular<br>might mean once a month not twice a week<br>so and and people generally tend to<br>overstate in a poll quite often you know<br>how good they are at doing something so<br>yeah so around 15% and then another 30%<br>of the population might go once or twice<br>a year might go to a wedding at a church<br>they might go to a Christmas service<br>with family uh or something like that so<br>there does seem to be some sort of basis<br>for this idea of<br>believing um without belonging that<br>perhaps then opens the door<br>to that believing being transferred into<br>the online world and to the things that<br>are available there to allow spiritual<br>growth if you want to call it that to be<br>accessed and developed um as well in<br>ways in which aren't timec consuming and<br>don't require a commitment of a morning<br>a week or something like that but can be<br>a continual um process as<br>well the Presbyterian Church did a<br>survey back in 2003 through AC neelson<br>uh on what were people's perceptions of<br>churches uh is institution or bricks and<br>mor churches and um very much the<br>language shifted from religion to<br>spirituality um which is a an<br>interesting uh twist because you know a<br>lot of religious people would consider<br>themselves spiritual uh but perhaps uh<br>those outside of the religious community<br>might not consider religious people as<br>spiritual uh as and whatever that means<br>and so you start to see things like um<br>you know spirituality is important but<br>there's something more life than just<br>existing or um you know you don't need<br>to go to church to express your<br>spirituality it's sort of an inward<br>thing you know I'll go for a walk in a<br>forest perhaps or uh you know I'll hang<br>out with my family or I'll play sport<br>and celebrate my body or the<br>spirituality of the gym perhaps um<br>there's a negative perception of that<br>the church actually offers anything<br>spiritual um as well and the way in<br>which the church functions in its<br>day-to-day commitment to things the<br>Rhythm of Life in a particular<br>congregation or something maybe not at<br>all the way in which the actual rhythms<br>of Life function for other people and so<br>rather than traditionally in Christendom<br>The rhythms of the church year The<br>rhythms of the church week sort of<br>dictating how the community might<br>function and Orient itself around now<br>you have two completely different sets<br>of rhythms that don't always synchronize<br>themselves um and then you try also the<br>idea that the the language of journeying<br>comes through so um and this is<br>something that Robert wno brings out<br>looking at American religion since the<br>1950s that um you've gone from a<br>spirituality of a dwelling or a place to<br>a spirituality of a of seeking or of<br>Journey and it's a change in the way in<br>which people thinks you know I'm on a<br>journey the journey is the reward<br>perhaps uh I'm you know continue looking<br>for something you know I still haven't<br>found what I'm looking for type of<br>spirituality um as well so it's a and<br>that that Journey process allows you to<br>construct your own sort of sense of<br>spirituality and religion rather than<br>being told what it is uh it allows you<br>to participate in things so it's<br>participatory um it allows people to be<br>personally responsible perhaps for their<br>salvation and it doesn't necessarily<br>dictate that you belong to a particular<br>community and so you know then you come<br>to talking about online spirit<br>spirituality or or spirituality online<br>or religion online then you really sort<br>of need to try and thresh out a little<br>bit what this idea of spirituality is<br>and so um that's the sort of the the<br>question for the next couple of minutes<br>is um what a you know just sit there and<br>just have a think about what are some of<br>the uh different different ways you<br>that I thought C<br>up okay okay so Heidi Campbell one of<br>the readings had a definition of<br>spirituality and yeah she did um she<br>said uh spirituality is a concept p page<br>54 is a concept found in many religions<br>religious traditions and World Views it<br>can be synonymous with Consciousness and<br>implies that Humanity exists as a union<br>of a body and a spirit Spirit is seem<br>distinct from the physical matter<br>spirituality differs from theology which<br>is on the level ation of religious<br>doctrines and Concepts spirituality or<br>the spiritual refers to the human search<br>for meaning significance recognizing the<br>existence and development of the<br>spiritual Dimension and individual life<br>okay so in that particular case she's<br>bringing out that spirituality is<br>connected with an individual and it's<br>a quest for meaning and purpose okay so<br>what are some of the other things though<br>that that people think<br>about I mean one of the things that came<br>up there was that religion if she's in<br>equating that with theology is a set of<br>ideas and spirituality perhaps is a<br>lived experience that's a a fairly<br>common sort of Academic Way of of of<br>distinct of of saying it it seems to me<br>to be quite a jetic sort of<br>understanding of<br>spiritual the Mind man side of it which<br>isn't really um saying Orthodox Chris<br>understanding spirituality which<br>involves the whole whole<br>person the matter<br>ided out so<br>yeah yeah certainly some spiritualities<br>are very dualistic they very much you<br>know see it as the the tending of the<br>inner component as opposed to the outer<br>component or the or the integration of<br>of both of them but they still two<br>separate sorts of things um as well it's<br>uh you know<br>certainly you know there's always in<br>some sort of ways in which people Define<br>spirituality it's that integration of of<br>ideas um or beliefs values and sort of<br>practice that uh it Embraces not only<br>you know the things we think about but<br>also how we live in in the values and<br>those when where those come from and<br>certainly one of the the the ways in<br>which it's been characterized recently<br>is the shift from spirituality starts<br>within you and so perhaps going back to<br>that dualistic idea of some sort of<br>metaphysical component of Being Human<br>that's the starting point that you come<br>out of that and religion perhaps is a<br>system that's imposed upon you um a set<br>of ideas or values that come from an<br>external Source whether that's you know<br>a church or whether that's a religious<br>institution or whether that's God but<br>somehow or the Bible or something but<br>they're imposed on top of of the<br>individual uh human being<br>spiritual yeah yeah so certainly yes<br>it's not just about you know sort of<br>saying you know who who you are but it's<br>sort of who you can be how you engage<br>with the world and and summarizing all<br>the experiences behind you and that's<br>some of the things we'll bring out when<br>we look at online religion is how this<br>quest for meaning how perhaps these<br>shaping of ideas and values and<br>practices actually then get transposed<br>into the online World in different ways<br>from religion online which might be<br>perhaps the way in which institutions<br>and traditions try and project<br>themselves forward to online religion<br>which might be again starting with the<br>individual quest for meaning and and<br>starting with what what works what<br>practices work for me inally exploring<br>that but anyway that's that's probably a<br>good place to stop and uh and then when<br>we come back after the Break um we'll um<br>you know pick up some of that and we'll<br>actually explore some of that in a bit<br>more detail excellent thank you
