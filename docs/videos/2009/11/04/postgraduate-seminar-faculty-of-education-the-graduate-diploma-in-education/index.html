about<br>the slight delay I just realized that um<br>parking and rain and all the other<br>things mean that sometimes you're<br>running a few minutes late um my name is<br>Kate wi I work with the faculty of<br>education and um it's been my pleasure<br>tonight to arrange for uh the academics<br>of the programs that you're interested<br>in as well as the Consultants from the<br>Student Center to come allinone along<br>with some of the student services so<br>that you can sort of get a One-Stop shop<br>uh in terms of what you might think of<br>studying next year so the way the<br>evening will run is that I will just do<br>a brief introduction to the idea of The<br>Graduate diploma uh and then I'm going<br>to invite each of the the head of<br>programs to come up and speak<br>specifically about their program uh and<br>then we've actually got a few students<br>from each of the programs to come and<br>speak to you just about from their<br>personal experience um I would love to<br>say questions but what I would suggest<br>is that you hold on to your questions<br>until the end and we're hoping to finish<br>out of here about4 7 uh and from that<br>time until 8:00 we'd invite you to join<br>us in some refreshments um and a chance<br>to also meet and greet with some of the<br>students the lecturers and some of the<br>services such as teach in Zed about the<br>study Awards uh the school graduate<br>studies and the international office<br>okay so um if I just kick it off and um<br>get started with uh basically the idea<br>of The Graduate<br>diploma I'm sure a lot of you have um<br>been Savvy enough to go on to the<br>internet and read up a little bit about<br>it basically it is a diploma that you<br>would do after uh you have obtained a<br>bachelor's degree from either a New<br>Zealand University or an overseas<br>University it is you complete it in one<br>year fulltime and they're quite<br>intensive that's quite an intensive year<br>and I'm sure that the heads of program<br>will stress this greatly in their<br>presentations that it's it's not an easy<br>year by any means but it's a very<br>rewarding year uh we do have an early<br>closing Daye and that's something that<br>I'd really like everybody to note down<br>the first of November 2009 okay for next<br>semester um and I'm sure all of you have<br>had a little look at the application<br>form which I will discuss at the very<br>end and realize that that does take a<br>bit of time to fill out so it means<br>getting organized and making some<br>decisions sooner rather than later uh<br>most of the courses available in the<br>various graduate diplomas are at the<br>ipsum campus which of course is located<br>in ium about 10 minutes away from the<br>city campus um some courses may have an<br>options between the city in ium and M<br>out in manal but that obviously depends<br>on which course you're looking at doing<br>the lovely thing about The Graduate<br>diploma is it is taught in small class<br>groups of 35 okay so you're not some of<br>you will be used to large lecture groups<br>from your time and your engineering<br>degrees uh your Arts degrees of 3 four 5<br>600 people um this is a chance that you<br>get to work in often more smaller class<br>environment which means you get to<br>interact and get to know your classmates<br>very well and it's a very rewarding<br>experience for later on when you are<br>teaching classes of a similar size um in<br>terms of gaining entrance as I said we<br>need you to have completed an A New<br>Zealand degree or an approved equivalent<br>which is something that the university<br>will approve previously approved from<br>the New Zealand qualifications Authority<br>um after you've filled in that form a<br>personal referees and an interview is<br>required as well so it's not just enough<br>to have that actual degree you must go<br>through the interview process and uh<br>again I hope and I'm sure that the heads<br>of programs will stress the importance<br>of going to get some experience in these<br>particular Fields so that you've got<br>something to work with in the interview<br>in terms of your experience in the early<br>childhood sector secondary sector or<br>primary sector uh there will be evidence<br>of competen in written and spoken spoken<br>English um judged at the interview and<br>that's again another wonderful reason to<br>meet you face to face as well as telling<br>you a little bit more about the program<br>and answering any questions you might<br>have at that time uh and of course we<br>want to have a look at the personal<br>qualities for teaching and again I hope<br>tonight that you will learn about some<br>of those personal qualities um in terms<br>of going into teaching and have a look<br>at yourself and and whether you would<br>like to go ahead and apply for these<br>programs next<br>year in terms of assessment um it's<br>basically going through internals again<br>in terms of assignments and of course<br>your practical work in schools which is<br>is called practicum um the the<br>assessment scale is very similar to um<br>what you would have been using to at<br>University in terms of getting right<br>through to the A+ and I'm sure none of<br>you need to look at the D minus so uh<br>basically you know it should be not a<br>shock to the system at all the practicum<br>probably is going to be a bit different<br>from some of you who have done other<br>degrees uh it's an it's an idea of um<br>getting the observation skills initially<br>in that environment and then at the end<br>practicing the things that you were<br>learning in theory putting them into the<br>practice so that when you come out at<br>the end of that year you feel confident<br>to walk into that area uh and be able to<br>teach okay uh you get to work along<br>selected associate teachers um who help<br>you guide you give you advice and<br>support you uh and you basically start<br>with very small task and then you build<br>up to the end where the associate<br>teacher is obviously at the back of the<br>room observing you um and you're taking<br>the whole classes so um it's very much<br>an interdisciplinary everyone is working<br>with everybody else and most people find<br>it a very very rewarding year in terms<br>of getting to know a lot of different<br>The Graduate diploma of Early Childhood<br>is a like Kate said a one-year program<br>but an intensive program it does a year<br>and a quarter's academic work in a year<br>so our um we start in January not in<br>March as one would usually do with an<br>undergraduate qualification you'll learn<br>about the social and um learning context<br>specific to Early Childhood so you'd be<br>learning about um how a team works<br>together in An Early Childhood Center<br>and how children learn and how you<br>facilitate and interact with that in<br>early childhood there's a lot of work<br>with families um so it's uh seen as<br>partnership with parents so there's a<br>lot of work around relating to parents<br>and supporting them as well as working<br>with the children in the program we<br>cover all curriculum areas we have<br>courses that look at um science maths<br>and Technology other courses that<br>explore the art<br>um courses that explore explore the<br>theory of learning and courses that<br>explore um language and how that<br>develops so it's a fully rounded course<br>in terms of all the areas of the<br>curriculum that that are important to be<br>looking at within with young<br>children um and we also have a course<br>that looks at the diversity of New<br>Zealand society and working with the the<br>very Multicultural range of family and<br>children that are present in our early<br>childhood centers today the course<br>centers on learning from birth to five<br>because we do have um children as young<br>as a few months old in Education and<br>Care Centers uh right up to to 5year<br>olds um sort of moving on into um deeper<br>curriculum that prepares them well for<br>their next phase of learning<br>you gain 14 weeks of practice in early<br>childhood centers that and you gain um<br>practice in three different settings and<br>uh so we we want you to work have<br>experience with infants and toddlers<br>have experience with older children have<br>experience in Education and Care Centers<br>and have experience in public<br>kindergartens so there's a whole variety<br>of um experiences in ter terms of your<br>practicum we try as much as possible to<br>place you on practicums within the<br>suburbs that you live in we don't expect<br>if you live in um that if you live in<br>West Oakland we're not going to send you<br>um all the way out to the east eastn<br>suburbs for a practicum so we try to be<br>sensitive and be aware as much as we can<br>about people's need needs in terms of um<br>um the geographic places where they live<br>the program qualifies you to be a New<br>Zealand registered<br>teacher and we talk more about that<br>towards the end of the program it's a<br>professional qualification so we're<br>constantly working to see you um as a<br>professional teacher and the development<br>of that into a beginning teacher status<br>uh when you've completed the program<br>it's available on campus at the iom<br>campus and it's also available<br>flexi a typical um year for<br>us um is it will start in um sort of mid<br>January um and you'll have um some<br>intensive work then either on the<br>internet as flexi students or in face t-<br>face lectures and they're usually two<br>days a week leaving full days a week<br>leaving the other days to do some of<br>your um some Independent Learning and<br>study then there's a 3-week practicum<br>where which is 7 and 1/2 hours a day 5<br>days a week in the Early Childhood<br>Center then you're back to lectures and<br>then you head into a 4-week practicum<br>and then the semester one finishes you<br>move into semester 2 and at the end of<br>semester 2 is a 7 week practicum the<br>difference between the flexi mode and<br>the face to-face mode is that the face<br>tace people get face tace lectures the<br>um flexi mode get internet lectures so<br>there's an expectation that you'll<br>participate as much online as you would<br>in fact more than you would actually<br>sitting in a in a classroom and and you<br>need to come to um up to seven days on<br>campus each semester to consolidate and<br>to do the types of things that are<br>practical things that are very difficult<br>to do over the N Net like dancing like<br>exploring maths through physical um<br>activities likees um amazing um DVDs<br>that are hard to get copyright to give<br>you all access to so we we try and make<br>the the on campus very um interactive<br>it's good to get to know each<br>other um especially at the beginning of<br>the program so it makes it easier to<br>talk on the net<br>together the one comment I would make as<br>if you're studying fulltime whether<br>you're flexy well especially if you're<br>flexy because it would be hard to do<br>face to<br>face you can't work fulltime at the same<br>time people try and you can't live two<br>lives at the one time and most people<br>who start off trying to do that either<br>become part-time at their course or<br>part-time at their work so the options<br>are flexy or face to face fulltime flexy<br>or face to face parttime over 2 years<br>okay but you do need to watch that cuz<br>some people see the word flexy and that<br>sort of means you can flex your week out<br>but there's still only so many hours in<br>a day and so I encourage people not to<br>work more than 3 days a week if they're<br>studying fulltime and if they do that to<br>realize that they probably need to<br>devote the Saturday to their study as<br>well at the moment there are teaching z<br>um is pce<br>scholarships and it's worth having a<br>look at those and I believe there's<br>someone outside that can talk to you<br>about those today we also at the moment<br>have and I think we do have for 2010 and<br>you could ask probably the teach in Zed<br>person um Ministry of Education grants<br>of<br>$33,000 for the course but you can't<br>actually have a teaching Z scholarship<br>and a Ministry $3,000 Grant the grant is<br>for anyone who enrolls in the program<br>and is not bonded is not you get um you<br>get paid $1,500 up front and then um in<br>the second semester you get paid another<br>1,500 it's a an incentive Grant um for<br>people to consider applying for um Early<br>Childhood now unfortunately Stu who was<br>going to be here who's actually one of<br>our males on The Graduate diploma we<br>have several of those um who was going<br>to be here today couldn't come and um so<br>we don't have any students per se but<br>the comments that students say to me are<br>things<br>like um the course was more intense and<br>more thorough than I thought it would be<br>great to have the upto-date research the<br>types of things that are covered in the<br>program really enthusiastic supportive<br>lecturers but that they offer<br>underestimated the amount of work in an<br>intensive graduate diploma especially<br>see it was early childhood we just<br>didn't think there'd be so much Theory<br>attached so and and usually people who<br>choose to go into this course I would<br>just reiterate what Kate was saying<br>about making sure that you're um that<br>you've actually visited An Early<br>Childhood Center and to have a feeling<br>for what that's like and a feeling for<br>what's that like going to be like on a<br>day today basis for you I mean the<br>course inspires you to see it deeper and<br>to be more fulfilled in terms of how you<br>see yourself as an early childhood<br>teacher but you need to first of all<br>have experienced or thought about or<br>reflected what it's like for you to<br>actually work with young children for<br>you Koto nice to be here and to see you<br>all here um this this<br>evening um after I speak I've got two<br>wonderful students from our uh program<br>Leni and Amanda who are going to speak<br>to you so I won't be speaking too long<br>because I want them to take the center<br>stage well there's a a lot to say so<br>I've got to be careful that I don't say<br>too<br>much now the first thing just like The<br>Graduate diploma in in ECE we're a um a<br>program that gets delivered in one year<br>but we're actually a 1.3 Academic Year<br>so like the Early Childhood we start in<br>January and we don't finish until<br>November which makes it a very intensive<br>year and I just want to reiterate really<br>the message that Barbara had is that uh<br>work and and the program is slightly<br>incompatible you can do some work to<br>earn money but you won't be able to work<br>I think more than one day a week without<br>really tiring yourself or putting<br>yourself under<br>stress um the other thing I thought want<br>to say is that the we have it available<br>in part-time and part-time is O um only<br>able to be done if you're in the January<br>intake we don't do it for the midyear<br>intake in July at the moment our midyear<br>intake for July I think is closed now<br>but you can start applying for January<br>from now on so get those applications<br>rolling if you come into this program<br>you either eligible to teach in primary<br>as it says their intermediate and Middle<br>School positions now middle schools are<br>in that age group often from um what we<br>used to call this intermediate in forms<br>three and four and there are type of<br>school that's starting to merge and<br>Suits a number of people so that's<br>another<br>option sometimes after people have<br>gained their uh full registration and<br>taught in primary for a number of years<br>they do move into secondary because they<br>want to have some extra experience and<br>you can do that but you do have to have<br>specialized subject areas such as<br>technology or math there'll be some<br>areas where that would not apply and<br>sometimes work in with a special uh<br>areas such as reading recover reading<br>and those sorts of things you could get<br>jobs in the secondary school but I think<br>it's pretty good to stay in the in the<br>primary school it's quite wonderful now<br>you notice to there that you are as a a<br>graduate program because you've already<br>got a a a first degree an undergraduate<br>degree you started a higher salary rate<br>and that's at the same level as a the<br>starting rate as secondary teachers<br>now and again if people have done some<br>had some experience overseas teaching um<br>and other sorts of things that are<br>really closely related to teaching you<br>can actually even start on a slightly<br>higher<br>salary um the Practical experience is<br>the bit that everybody likes and you<br>will note later if I um that we have<br>three practicums per year three block<br>practicums and another thing that we<br>have is our Tuesdays in schools<br>program every Tuesday or most Tuesdays<br>in the Years students go into a school a<br>single day uh practicum in a school and<br>do a large number of professional<br>activities um other times we have three<br>block practicum we have one in in<br>February where you spend two years in a<br>two years two weeks in a school then in<br>about May which is happening soon you<br>spend five weeks in a school and then at<br>the end of the year you spend another<br>five weeks in a<br>school at the beginning of the year when<br>you first go out in the beginning of the<br>year you see how a classroom is set up<br>at the beginning of the year and how a<br>teacher gets 30 unknown children and<br>tries to bring them together in one<br>whole well organized class and it's a<br>task but they they do it and the second<br>practicum we built um help you and<br>assist you to take responsibility for a<br>class for one week and then by the end<br>of the year you get practice at uh<br>taking responsibility for a whole class<br>for 3 weeks and during that time your<br>associate teachers slowly Build You Up<br>and team teach with you so that you're<br>able to do that you don't get thrown in<br>at the deep<br>end um I'm having trouble seeing I<br>better put my glasses on one of the<br>things that is special about our<br>practicum we work with a Consortium of<br>schools this year for our January intake<br>we have 20 schools and these<br>schools work with all of our students so<br>you rotate you visit three different<br>schools during the year that enables you<br>to try two different levels you need to<br>do a junior class and a senior class and<br>you also need to work in GE G different<br>geographical orile areas so that you get<br>a really good look at the range of<br>schools that are available and also the<br>different types of schools each school<br>has its own philosophy its own culture<br>and by the end of the year you'll have a<br>really good idea what sort of school<br>you'd like to teach in and the type of<br>school that fits with your personal<br>teaching philosophy which is something<br>we expect and hope that everybody<br>develops by the end of the<br>year I think one of the other benefits<br>of being in this program is that that<br>working together with smaller classrooms<br>we have this year we've had four streams<br>of about 35 36 in a class and people get<br>to know each other well and I find that<br>students are really supportive of each<br>other and do a lot of planning and work<br>together and that way you tend to<br>replicate as a student the type of work<br>that needs to be done in a school<br>because schools work in teams a lot and<br>I think if you want to be a primary<br>teacher you need to be the type of<br>person that's a team player the lone dog<br>doesn't really fit into schools these<br>days one thing that is something you<br>need to um be aware of is that we do<br>need students to travel around the<br>Consortium of<br>schools and we try not to send you too<br>far but one of the things that we have<br>to deal with is Oakland's traffic and it<br>is awful and I don't think it's getting<br>any better and sometimes public<br>transport is good in some areas and<br>other times it isn't so I think that's<br>probably one of the difficult things<br>about going out on<br>practicum we do try to get people to<br>carpol as well so that you share<br>transport you're more green and you<br>share the<br>costs talking about transport one of the<br>great things things about being based at<br>the Epsom campus is that parking is free<br>and I don't think that happens much<br>anywhere else so there are plenty of car<br>Parks the only time that doesn't count<br>is when everybody's on campus and no<br>one's out on practicum and that's only a<br>few times per<br>week the other thing that we Center on<br>we teach in our courses we look at<br>curriculum subjects and we cover the key<br>or the main learning area<br>that are taught in the primary school<br>curriculum we have seven learning areas<br>things such as maths language literacy<br>PE Health all those sorts of areas<br>social studies science and you do a<br>course in each one of<br>those we also do professional courses<br>which look at education and the needs of<br>the professional teacher and that helps<br>you prepare for your<br>practicum now this this here is a a<br>diagram of what a typical year might<br>look like at the moment we've um we've<br>got the practicum one that we've this<br>year not having a practicum 2 split into<br>a and b we've changed that a bit but but<br>we still got that for the midyear group<br>and you will see that um the Le year is<br>quite<br>long um one of the things that we do is<br>we have a lot of staff that work that<br>you see regularly for instance we have<br>some courses that go for a year part A<br>and B and you work with the same<br>lecturers who get to know you really<br>really well and when you're out on a<br>school we also have what we call liaison<br>lecturers they visit the same school and<br>the same groups of students so that you<br>can feel comfortable with them and be<br>able to talk to them in a professional<br>way so that they can support<br>you<br>you'll notice that in November it says<br>there lectures after practicum 3 we<br>don't have course lecture lectures<br>anymore we finish with a a coming<br>together where we present our portfolio<br>of all the things that we've learned and<br>we also have Support Services come in<br>and talk to students and these are the<br>support student uh centers like team<br>Solutions who help you when you're a<br>beginning teacher in a school and so you<br>meet those people early on and they are<br>able to tell you what sort of help they<br>can give you because when you're a<br>beginning teacher as some of you might<br>have read you you don't actually teach a<br>full uh week you actually teach a08 of a<br>week and about 0 2 of your time is used<br>to with with a school to support you in<br>your professional development and<br>sometimes you visit other schools<br>sometimes you go on horses so we<br>actually link with that before you start<br>as a first year year<br>teacher and I think I'll leave that and<br>I'll get the two wonderful people Amanda<br>and eleny to come and introduce<br>themselves and talk to you about their<br>program my name is leani salisa and I<br>think we are now in<br>our fifth month of um studying in The<br>Graduate diploma of primary um prior to<br>this I have done two degrees I did um a<br>ba and anthropology um social<br>anthropology and English literature and<br>I did an honors degree in museums and<br>cultural heritage last year I was<br>employed at the Oakland Museum as pacif<br>educator and I decided with all of the<br>exciting events that you might have read<br>about on the front page of the herald um<br>and the economic situation of our great<br>nation I just decided that um teaching<br>was something that I wanted to pursue<br>now experiences on the course have been<br>challenging this time last year I<br>attended a day similar to this and I had<br>people um I Heard Jean say that the<br>course load was considerable and she was<br>right she's an honest woman and<br>um most certainly it is intensive it's a<br>different kind of work to ba studies um<br>one thing that shocked my system was um<br>the 8:30 start um and then often having<br>lectures later into the night<br>um we have a rich and varied experience<br>because of the seven curriculum areas<br>that we're<br>studying uh one thing that I've<br>definitely noticed is that you can't shy<br>away from what you don't like like I did<br>in my ba um and you have to be ready to<br>walk into a situation and think with<br>this time next year I'm going to be<br>having um 60 pairs of eyes um sitting in<br>front of me in my classroom and I need<br>to have the confidence to be able to<br>teach that and um for in my role at the<br>Museum I had taught um only uh culture<br>and history of the Pacific so that is<br>something that I've had to really um<br>push myself<br>towards um The Learning communities that<br>happen um that are created at Epsom are<br>really strong um I've met some really<br>inspiring people who've been at the<br>Forefront of um the new curriculum and<br>people who are expert in the areas are<br>really really essential to know I think<br>to enrich your experience as a student<br>um one thing that has that both Amanda<br>and I um have P taken in I'm not making<br>words up as I go um is that we're both<br>student reps I was um nominated in my<br>absence and came back the next day and<br>found out that I was a student rep um<br>it's something that i' never done before<br>but what that's me meant for me as um<br>being in charge of the F of our of our<br>um strength we've got 35 people we've<br>got seven International students so one<br>of the most interesting things we've<br>done so far is um an activity where<br>we've had to explain what scon were now<br>you try telling someone te teaching an<br>adult that who's come from Egypt and<br>English is their fourth language okay um<br>also we have um started our own tedl<br>group um we're working our stream that's<br>our learning group so that's the 36<br>students we're working towards planning<br>our own nor is this is all Co curricular<br>activities it's not necessarily relate<br>to the curriculum but this is something<br>we're doing of our own accord and um the<br>whole the entire um graduate diploma in<br>primary is looking to attend um no at<br>our um local e Tommy and so what we uh<br>every day we walk into a context we were<br>with people who um are in search of<br>social justice they people who are<br>motivated they're people who want to be<br>there and they're people who are set on<br>making a change so I encourage you<br>towards this course I chose this course<br>above any other because I went out into<br>schools and I asked them which are the<br>best graduates and where do they come<br>from<br>K all right Koto good evening everybody<br>um my name is Amanda Kennedy I'll just<br>talk a little bit about um why I decided<br>to do a little bit about my experience<br>and um have a chat about practicum um my<br>academic background as environmental<br>science and English and um the last few<br>years I've spent teaching overseas and<br>that's pretty much where and when I fell<br>in love with the profession I came back<br>um pretty desperate to do it I did have<br>a part-time job at first um as these<br>lovely ladies have pointed out it's<br>really tough um if you really have to<br>work part-time keep it short and try and<br>keep your eyes flexible um yeah this<br>course is for you if you don't like free<br>time a lot that's for sure um a lot of<br>people on the course are doing it<br>because it's um as people point out it's<br>it's pretty much Recession Proof and a<br>lot of people this year have have talked<br>about that as being one of their um<br>highest<br>motivations um my owner a little more<br>idealistic I think than that um it's<br>it's something that's different every<br>day and you see that from the moment you<br>go out on practicum every day is<br>different every day is something unexp<br>expected and it's just so much fun um<br>practicum is such a buzz practicum is<br>great fun you you start out within two<br>weeks of starting the course you're in<br>the classroom so in the right from the<br>beginning you get a real feel of whether<br>or not this is for you which is really<br>good as well because you can get a<br>refund at that stage yeah um and so if<br>you if you enjoy the practicum and you<br>want to keep going um then you do the<br>Tuesdays in schools which is is a really<br>good way to get a get an idea of how<br>schools function over the whole excuse<br>me over the whole year um you sort of<br>get snapshots of how it goes as well as<br>the block practicums where you um you're<br>in a class over a period of you know a<br>few weeks with your teacher and that is<br>I I can't sort of talk highly enough of<br>that experience it's just it's it's<br>really fantastic to be in a classroom<br>with a teacher who's there to support<br>you and guide you you get to see a whole<br>lot of different teachers and different<br>teaching styles in context um you get to<br>go to high desile schools Lowes our<br>schools so you can get a feel for what<br>kind of teaching you want to do as well<br>which is really good you can ask the<br>teachers any kind of questions you have<br>and it's really Hands-On so you're<br>teaching right from day one they really<br>encourage you to get stuck in um so if<br>you're nervous about being in front of a<br>class of kids that just goes straight<br>away pretty much that's great um<br>if it doesn't go you're in trouble<br>because there's a lot of practicum work<br>yeah and and it's good for just getting<br>a you know a bit of familiarity with the<br>school processes and things<br>um that's all I pretty much have to say<br>course Koto it's good to see you all<br>here tonight um I've got two students<br>student teachers here who are also going<br>to talk about the course so I'm not<br>going to talk for a huge amount of time<br>first of all I need to go right um our<br>course is a full-time onee course and it<br>begins on the when the university starts<br>we start around about the 2nd or so of<br>March and continue until the 20th of<br>November this year with a 3E break in<br>the middle of the year so it's a it's<br>we're not a 1.2 course we're or 1.3<br>we're a one one course um and to come<br>into the program you um need to be able<br>to teach a school subject that is taught<br>between you know from years 9 to 13 um<br>the you you in other words you have to<br>have a specialty subject that you can<br>teach and has to be one that is taught<br>in a at school there 14 weeks of<br>practicum during the year and that's um<br>on two different situations we really<br>like you to go to two completely<br>different schools and um have a very<br>different experience the first practicum<br>is actually divided into two the first<br>two weeks are really observation many of<br>our students haven't been in school for<br>for years last year for example I think<br>it was last year the age range was from<br>about 20 through to probably um 65 or so<br>and um the so many of those people had<br>not been in school for a very long time<br>so those first two weeks are really<br>orientation reorientation to what<br>schools are all about then they then<br>people return to the same school for a<br>5we block of teaching and that's where<br>the students are right now then later in<br>semester 2 they returned to a to a<br>different school for another 7we<br>experience and this time it's 5 weeks<br>before the break before the September<br>break and 2 weeks after the break and<br>when they return after the break we<br>really want them to take um<br>responsibility for the junior classes<br>they're working with so that they get a<br>feeling for what it's like to be totally<br>responsible for responsible for a class<br>as they will be a few months after that<br>in February of next year most of our<br>pretty well our entire program is based<br>at Epsom um we do have a one of our core<br>courses that is taught out at MIT one<br>evening and we have some a couple of<br>curriculum courses history geography<br>Classics come in here to the city campus<br>and do some work with the Departments<br>here the program is actually comprised<br>of of it's 120 points is the basic<br>program and that's what we encourage<br>people to do because it is a very<br>full-time course it is always as the<br>others have said more than you ever<br>expect um there are 60 of those points<br>are core papers that everybody everybody<br>does one is sort of an education<br>studies fako um um which is a a course<br>in teaching and learning in secondary<br>classrooms and the second um compulsory<br>paper is the practicum paper and then<br>you choose 60 points worth of of<br>curriculum courses and usually in two<br>subjects although it could be in one for<br>example if you're doing maths you can<br>major simply in maths<br>um you are advised when you apply to us<br>you have to put in a transcript for your<br>degree and it is your your application<br>is is checked over by the curriculum<br>Specialists who see that you've got the<br>right combination of subjects to teach<br>the subjects that you'd like to do so<br>you do get quite a bit of advice and<br>guidance from us and we really like it<br>if you consult Us in advance for example<br>some of you might be finishing next<br>semester and it's a good good<br>opportunity to check out right now<br>whether you've got the right structure<br>in your degree because there may still<br>be time to get the the papers that that<br>will sort of cement your acceptability<br>for the<br>program um our courses are are largely<br>delivered through lectures and sort of<br>small and small classes our core papers<br>tend to be about 30 30 35 in size but<br>the curriculum um papers tend to be<br>quite a lot smaller because some of the<br>secondary subjects like classical<br>studies or some on language or Spanish<br>um or media studies and things are not<br>is<br>right this is very much the structure<br>that I've talked about the two weeks in<br>practicum practicum one and the F<br>returning for five<br>weeks in semester two we have a five<br>week block before people go out on the<br>second practicum and part the final week<br>before practicum we've got quite an<br>emphasis on on careers when principes<br>come in and you get an opportunity to<br>meet them teachers Council comes and you<br>get an opportunity to find out about<br>registration because in the secondary<br>system people are applying for for jobs<br>usually from about nowadays from about<br>July on so that happens in August for<br>our<br>students okay we've got Jeff and Natasha<br>here are going to talk to you in a<br>moment but just before they do I just<br>want to mention a couple of things about<br>the qualities that I think that you need<br>I think first of all your motivation to<br>teach needs to be a great deal stronger<br>than just the teaching as a Recession<br>Proof career you really do have to enjoy<br>adolescence and we are very staunch in<br>wanting you to visit a school before you<br>make an application and the fact that<br>you're here tonight suggests to me that<br>you're highly organized and well<br>motivated um and I'd urge you to to<br>think about visiting a school in term<br>two or three term four schools are too<br>busy the seniors are only there for a<br>short time term three gives you a very<br>good idea of what a school is like you<br>really do need to visit a secondary<br>school have a good look at adolescence<br>and ask yourself do I want to work with<br>young people this age you really do have<br>to like adolescence you've got to be<br>flexible you've got to be resilient and<br>you've got to be open to learning um and<br>I think you've got to be willing to<br>focus on providing opportunities for all<br>students to learn not just students like<br>yourselves who are probably very<br>successful at school but all students<br>um you've also got to make um be willing<br>to make a shift in your thinking in the<br>year that you spend with us because<br>you're moving from being a student H to<br>being a professional teacher and there<br>is quite a shift to make for many people<br>especially people who' have come<br>straight from school it's quite a<br>different sort of way of thinking our<br>day starts usually at 8:30 and often<br>ends at 6:30 so it's pretty full full-on<br>commitment um teaching is however is<br>always stimulating a certain can tell<br>you that a secondary classroom is never<br>dull it's um often very stressful but<br>it's um often a lot of fun as well and<br>I'd really urge you to to go to the<br>school have a good look at it and think<br>about making an application to us good<br>and early we close our applications<br>close on November the 1st I can't tell<br>you yet what the teach New Zealand<br>scholarships will be in this year um we<br>haven't heard from them yet as to where<br>the areas of of shortage are um in terms<br>of practicum just mentioned too that um<br>you we do want you to have two very<br>different experiences and often with<br>your subject restrictions you you may<br>have to travel um so you have to be<br>prepared for that uh and again as the<br>others have said it's really hard to<br>work some people start the course and<br>they think they're going to work<br>full-time I don't know where they get<br>this this notion from but very quickly<br>they realize you cannot do a full you<br>cannot hold down a full-time job and<br>take on full-time study you can do our<br>course part-time over two years and a<br>number of people do do that um but if<br>you're going to take the study full-time<br>I'd urge you to think about working no<br>more than perhaps a day in the weekend<br>or and maybe an evening a week because<br>beyond that it becomes it becomes very<br>very difficult okay I'm willing to talk<br>to you afterwards and answer any<br>questions you have particularly about<br>just subjects if you are concerned about<br>whether you have the right subjects for<br>secondary<br>hi everyone my name is Natasha<br>Falcon<br>um I didn't always want to be a<br>teacher I um I always thought never got<br>into teaching you know that's the thing<br>you do if you can't you know make it in<br>your chosen career well my chosen career<br>was acting I went to drama school and<br>you know I was going to be a Hollywood<br>movie star but but um by the time I was<br>28 I realized that probably wasn't going<br>to happen and maybe there was a little<br>part of me that didn't really want that<br>anyway so I went back to my you know<br>deepest kind of motivating fact of why I<br>wanted to be an actor and I realized<br>that it was about giving a part of me<br>back and I graduated in<br>2007 um I spent a year acting doing<br>plays and short films and um bit of<br>casting here and there and I didn't<br>think you know I've G to education<br>because we're going into a recession in<br>the acting industry everyone's in<br>permanent<br>recession only 2% of people who put<br>their um put their job down as an actor<br>in 2007 earned over $50,000<br>um also that year the guy who won New<br>Zealand's best top actor award only<br>earned $21,000 so I figured that if I<br>became a teacher that would be a step up<br>for me um yeah so there was a huge<br>decision making process involved which<br>I'm sure some people out there might be<br>going through a similar kind of thing<br>you<br>know making a huge Paradigm Shift<br>wrenching up all of your beliefs about<br>who you were what you're going to be<br>doing and moving them into a new<br>paradigm which is what I did it took a<br>lot of hard work and a lot of<br>disciplining myself to you know look at<br>myself and say no I'm not a failure I<br>didn't fail at My Chosen career I<br>actually just wanted to do something a<br>little bit different I didn't want to<br>climb to the top of my Heap I wanted to<br>expand breadthwise and and give and be<br>in a a much more nurturing fi field than<br>I felt that I was in so I'm really happy<br>to be on this program it's really it is<br>really tough I've found that but I've<br>also found that the lecturers are very<br>very generous I've never been turned<br>away when I've knocked on a door to ask<br>questions they've always been there<br>they've always offered themselves time<br>of their own accord to help with<br>assignments um and I feel very very<br>supportive<br>that's uh thanks um I'm representing the<br>Baby Boomers here for any of you that<br>aren't moms and dads that are over<br>50 good on you um listen so I've uh I've<br>had my stripes torn off and my sword<br>broken across my knee several times<br>through my life so changing careers um<br>is something that I've been doing every<br>sort of 10 years or<br>so uh but this one was is uh obviously a<br>little different and it has been a bit<br>different and it's been a long time<br>coming and I've spoken to a lot of<br>people and some sort of inspirational<br>people that that inspired me that took<br>it up a bit later in life you said it<br>was great fun and uh I'd have to say<br>that the course compared to working for<br>yourself in the construction and<br>architecture business hassling around<br>for jobs and money the course is a<br>breeze you know but I'm just not g to<br>say that too long too loud and obviously<br>it is an intense course but a different<br>sort of intensity and it's very nice uh<br>the delivery is is is really quite nice<br>lots of time same similar Concepts over<br>and over again so they starting to soak<br>in because as you get older it does take<br>a bit longer for this stuff to soak<br>in um so practicum um yeah so uh my<br>first qu a call is wry Hill College wry<br>Hill College for those of Oakland is uh<br>a bit like the Prince song their college<br>forly known as Penrose high and uh I<br>spent a lot of time in my school years<br>uh I went to school at Ed of college in<br>paga fashion guys from Penrose college<br>cuz that was what we did when we went to<br>play Penrose or Tamaki or any of those<br>guys um I had a bunch of mared mates at<br>my school who looked out out for me and<br>I was the typical little smart uh SM guy<br>that um stood things up so we had a<br>great rivalry and it was really quite<br>fun to go back there and see see what it<br>was like and it's it's had a huge<br>Revolution so this is a incredibly<br>diverse school um<br>uh<br>um this 3 so Rec low social economic<br>group<br>um very high percentage of uh Indian<br>Fijian Indian uh I I believe believe uh<br>very small paring our population uh<br>other makeup is probably mainly pi and<br>Mar so um that was really fun for me<br>I've I've uh I live on Wy Island I've<br>dealt with some of the Rabel that go to<br>school on Mahi and it was a similar sort<br>of bunch to these guys free spirited<br>kids um very uh very Dynamic kids you<br>know very Dynamic kids and and really<br>good fun uh uh a lot of people was oh<br>you know you got to watch this there's<br>these big Pi guys they'll bash you and<br>this that the other and I tell you what<br>I've had nothing but uh Good Times there<br>so there's been no no drama as far as<br>that goes it's the biggest drama that I<br>had on the first two weeks was um on the<br>third false fire alarm all the kids came<br>running out say Mr Mister it's a real<br>fire so I Julie zipped in and um jumped<br>into to the building Ring of Fire and<br>extinguished it with my brand new shoes<br>survive um Hush Puppies shout out H they<br>can take it<br>all but I guess one of the things with a<br>with a school such as that it's quite a<br>small school only about 900 kids it's<br>really quite intimate small Department<br>there's only four or five in the<br>department um sort of hooked straight in<br>with uh with those people and um apart<br>from a bit of flitting around I really<br>got into see how the school worked how<br>um how those ins and outs and they are<br>intense little places from 8:15 in the<br>morning so whenever everybody goes it's<br>all happening it's all on there's people<br>in your face but very stimulating and uh<br>been thrown in um a little bit this week<br>cuz the head of department and my<br>session teacher is is ill so it's been<br>great because I've been uh some degree<br>left alone apart from the uh relieving<br>teachers who are legally require to sit<br>there and be<br>bored<br>um but I I spent many years in the<br>service industry and uh a lot of those<br>actually is an air stward and I would<br>have to say that apart from the big<br>packets of money and copious amounts of<br>alcohol there is quite a similarity and<br>you let me explain further let me<br>explain further there's a similarity and<br>and for those of you that have been in<br>the service industry um you would know<br>that you've got eyes on you the whole<br>time you've got eyes on you until you<br>can readjust your clothing without<br>somebody noticing and all those things<br>so it is quite intense but um these kids<br>have definitely been rewarding so um<br>we'll see how uh the next PR can<br>Compares with possibly a high desile<br>school with a different bunch of kids<br>but you know I uh I must say I do like<br>adolescence um I am one I'm just trapped<br>in an old guy's body and um I really<br>enjoy their in your face um and you have<br>to put up and or or be quiet so it's<br>really fun I'd recommend it uh to to<br>luck</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
