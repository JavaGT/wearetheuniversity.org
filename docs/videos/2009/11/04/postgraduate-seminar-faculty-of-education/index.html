accurate.</p><p>um all of our students matter to us but<br>I can say to you that as a dean of this<br>faculty postgraduate students matters<br>matter to this<br>enormously um first of all I'm excited<br>about the prospect that you want to<br>continue selling I think that's really<br>exciting for the professions that you<br>come from for the careers you're<br>involved with um but it's also exciting<br>from the point of view of us as faculty<br>teachers and researchers to work with<br>people that want to take their study<br>into the areas of research um and<br>further education so we're excited we're<br>excited at your interest we hope we can<br>turn that interest into something that<br>you find<br>satisfying we hope we can offer you<br>programs and courses that you find<br>rewarding and relevant and certainly one<br>of the things we want to hear from you<br>is that our courses and programs are<br>doing<br>that we welcome you here if you're doing<br>taught<br>postgraduate if you're doing<br>postgraduate thesis work or<br>dissertations and if you're here to do<br>doctoral study it really matters to us<br>as a faculty it really makes a<br>difference to the life of our faculty to<br>have you engag and involved with us so I<br>just want you I just want to say to you<br>as a Dean that your interest matters if<br>we can capitalize on that and help and<br>support and work with you productively<br>for you then that's going to be mutually<br>beneficial so thank you for being here<br>thank you for putting this first step<br>towards further study and I hope we can<br>convert it for you all the very best I<br>know that if you do get into it it will<br>be hard work I know that the vast<br>majority of you are probably in<br>full-time work and they're trying to do<br>study alongside that I can empathize<br>with that I did my doctoral degree while<br>I was in fulltime week as well I know<br>how hard that is I know how much<br>commitment that takes and uh I know at<br>times how you wish you'd never done it<br>and at times how you wish you need to<br>pull out of it but if you're in that<br>situation stick with it so thanks very<br>much thanks for being here and I'll pass<br>on to those who've got more detail to<br>you about the way the program is<br>you<br>I lecture across um two postgraduate<br>courses at the postgraduate Master's<br>level and every year I learn something<br>new and that's exciting I learn lots<br>from my research students as well that's<br>exciting that engagement and discussion<br>with my students I find really valuable<br>and I hope that you will also find<br>valuable the engagement that you will<br>have with other students and also with<br>your<br>lect so mov<br>on okay so you've come out um some time<br>ago and we've just got the teaching ones<br>up here but there are in fact social<br>work so you could have a Social Work<br>diploma or a degree but for most of you<br>are there any Social Work Human Services<br>people<br>here right so I can concentrate on the<br>teaching ones there so you have a<br>teaching diploma whether it's or a B<br>teacher you may want to go on to a<br>bachelor of education teacher<br>specialization that you're upskilling<br>from a diploma to a degree or you might<br>to go through the graduate diploma in<br>education the general one or the tesel<br>education from no from your graduate or<br>um degree or diploma you can move on to<br>a variety of different options if you<br>have a Bach of education and teaching<br>you can go on to be teaching honors or<br>if you've got graduate deploma you can<br>go on into the postgraduate diploma in<br>education um the bottom one there the<br>postgraduate diploma and educational<br>leadership is in dotted lines at the<br>moment because it's one of those courses<br>that I'll talk to you a little bit more<br>about late later um that we have<br>currently seeking approval to introduce<br>in<br>2010 all right so the postbad<br>diplomas um you move from them into the<br>Masters and from them into the doctor of<br>educations now there are some<br>eligibility criteria in these because<br>they determined to some extent by the<br>grades that you get in order to go on a<br>master of education you need to uh meet<br>a grade point um average and and try and<br>get a b um average of a b across your um<br>postgrad courses order to go Masters for<br>the doctor of Education you've got to<br>have got a masters with a at least a<br>second class first division honors um<br>and same with the doctor of philosophy<br>the doctor of education is an exciting<br>program CL us because it's a named<br>doctorate as opposed to the PHD which is<br>a university wide qualification the<br>Doctorate in Education is specifically<br>for people who are engaged in<br>professional um AC practice and in order<br>to get in there you have to um complete<br>practice<br>now there are also um programs um on<br>into the PHD and the Ed for people who<br>are ba who have ba honors in education<br>uh less likely to get into the Ed so<br>that's not um because you need that 5<br>years professional practice um for<br>eligibility into that but you can go<br>from a ba into ba honors postgraduate<br>diploma in artarts into master of arts<br>and education and into a PhD that a few<br>St so other options so if you happen to<br>be somebody who's doing a f of Arts at<br>the moment and majoring in education you<br>can in fact go on into the PHD and<br>education at that point if we've got the<br>grades again thank you and Social Work<br>similarly we don't have anybody here but<br>if you've got friends family who are um<br>engaged in social work then postgraduate<br>programs for them as well postgraduate<br>certificates and professional<br>supervision and in fact some teachers do<br>the postgraduate certific and diploma of<br>professional supervision as well though<br>it has a prim emphasis on clinical<br>supervision it also meets the needs of a<br>lot of teachers these days who are in<br>fact supervising um and mentoring<br>interesting now some new programs that<br>we have have developed and we hope to be<br>able to um have online for 2010 and the<br>university system we can develop our<br>programs but we also have to send them<br>um to what is called the committee of<br>University of academic programs for<br>approval and that's a national body and<br>these um four uh will be going to Q um<br>during<br>2009 for introduction of<br>20 now the first of those is a special<br>um specialization and then postgraduate<br>diploma of education for early career<br>teaching and it's for people who are<br>within their first 3 years of uh<br>teaching maybe in their two years of um<br>before they get full registration or the<br>first year after for registration and<br>it's a program designed to assist you to<br>enhance your practice to be focused in<br>this in the educational setting that<br>you're in um then there the postgraduate<br>diploma in educational leadership and<br>the master of educational leadership<br>both of those as you can see have a<br>focus on leadership now these knew that<br>in 2010 because we're shifting um<br>changing the title we used to have a<br>well we still do because it's on the<br>books at the moment a postgrad and the<br>master in educational management now the<br>focus in the field these days is not<br>about educational management but<br>educational leadership for Learning and<br>so the qualification structure and its<br>name and its composition is changing to<br>reflect that change in the um context of<br>Education in our country and then we<br>have a master of professional studies<br>and education now the master<br>professional studies is a qualification<br>that already exists in the university<br>and there are three other<br>specializations one by political studies<br>another by language teaching and<br>something else they're located in the m<br>in the faculty of Arts but what we have<br>developed is a new specialization for<br>um education now the interesting thing<br>about this is but people who have um<br>qualified um as a teacher in a onee<br>graduate diploma of teaching whether it<br>be primary Early Child order of<br>secondary and we have large numbers of<br>students who go through our grad courses<br>each year here and who have done that<br>and on top of another degree so they've<br>got a first degree whether Science and<br>History or planning or whatever it<br>happened to be and they come in and do a<br>year usually a Year's course in um<br>teaching then they can move directly<br>into a master professional studies and<br>education or it's got people who like<br>the phers who have done a 4year degree<br>um which is content subject based as<br>well as teach preparation for teaching<br>and so they can move into a master<br>professional studies and education too<br>so we're hoping to bring those online so<br>particularly I think for people who have<br>completed the gr dips and primary second<br>Early Childhood that's a new course for<br>you to look at next year and now that<br>will consist of a course on research<br>methods a content-based course in your<br>area of Interest so if you're a history<br>teacher you probably want to do<br>something either in history education or<br>maybe even a history course because<br>we've allowed for that and then a 60<br>point or half the time<br>dissertation very focused in your area<br>of practice ice so that's an opportunity<br>that we're quite excited about as well<br>so all of those four new qualifications<br>that we hope to get online in<br>2010 we're very excited about those we<br>hope that they will um Q will agree to<br>them they're there at the moment we're<br>you right now there been great pleasure<br>to introduce to you um one of our doctor<br>students who's going to talk to you<br>about research and why do it and Melanie<br>is a quite a special person actually<br>she's a common of scholar and the minute<br>she opens a mouth you'll know which<br>sure thank you good evening everyone<br>what an honor it is to be speaking to<br>you today and if you haven't gued I'm<br>from South Africa I'm an international<br>Commonwealth scholar and I've been here<br>at the faculty of education for uh year<br>and a half now and time is really<br>flowing and today I've been asked to<br>talk to you about why do research and I<br>think in all regards I'm the perfect<br>person to ask this question because if I<br>had asked been asked this question 5<br>years ago my answer to you would be<br>completely different to what I'm going<br>to chat to you about<br>tonight and just to give you a little<br>bit of background I'm a primary school<br>educator have been a primary school<br>educator for 8 years in South Africa<br>very much a practical person Lov the<br>school environment Lov children never<br>ever thought that research would be<br>something that I would focus my time and<br>energy on for me research was this kind<br>of pie in the sky Eerie fairy philosophy<br>ideology stuff that really didn't matter<br>to what we were doing in the classroom<br>teacher learner relationship and I just<br>thought what practicality will this have<br>and how will this impact my practice in<br>my<br>classroom so for promotion opportunities<br>and also I do have a a personal desire<br>for lifelong learning I decided to<br>enroll for a master's degree at the<br>South African University and I was very<br>disappointed when I realized that half<br>of this degree would um composed of a a<br>research component and I would have to<br>to Really undertake a serious research<br>project in order to get this<br>degree well how my life<br>changed um during this research process<br>I just my entire perception of research<br>changed I really saw the difference and<br>the impact of the research that I was<br>doing making on my own professional<br>development as well as my position as a<br>teacher and as an educator to a class of<br>30 students I undertook my research at<br>the school that I was teaching at and of<br>course adapted my methodology around<br>being a an active participant um<br>researcher and it just really blew my<br>mind and I've become so passionate and<br>i' I've built such a love for research<br>that I decided the PHD was the next step<br>and I just want to encourage you if<br>those of you that are thinking oh<br>research that's such a huge thing to<br>take on really I think the ability to<br>change your practice and to change<br>education should be your motivation and<br>I promise you it really does have that<br>impact it is the most exciting area to<br>be<br>in then just to talk to you about for a<br>brief while on my um topic because I'm<br>so passionate about it um I'm really<br>doing bad news education in South<br>African schools looking particularly at<br>disadvantaged and Rural schools in South<br>Africa and of course in light of our our<br>new democracy um policy has been<br>changing and it's such an exciting area<br>to be in and I'd really encourage you<br>that if you're you're embracing research<br>as part of your Masters or part of your<br>postgraduate experience to find<br>something that you really want to know<br>more about it just becomes such a a<br>personal experience and I have grown so<br>much in this research journey of mine I<br>also thought coming abroad you know why<br>literally go to the other side of the<br>world to do a PhD I thought oh I might<br>be losing a little bit of realism a<br>little bit of like on the ground level<br>staff in my research but I've just found<br>all the staff and lecturers and<br>professors and supervisors here at the<br>University of Oakland so wise really<br>there are just a bunch of such<br>intelligent people with such a range of<br>expertise that I'm probably learning<br>much more in this faculty than I could<br>be anywhere else in the world it really<br>is an international research community<br>and I feel that what I'm doing here can<br>really impact practice not only in my<br>country or not only in New Zealand but<br>worldwide it is an exciting area to be<br>in uh initially I thought once this PhD<br>is over that's it I'm never reading<br>another academic article I'm never<br>taking out another academic library book<br>I'm going to you know pick up those<br>lovely 600 page novels and Cur up on the<br>couch well that's also changed I've just<br>realized what an exciting environment<br>education is and how wonderful it is to<br>really delve into this academic<br>literature and to actually have a voice<br>I mean the opportunities for publication<br>the opportunities to really make your<br>your little research known um<br>internationally or even on a national<br>level is just amazing and it gives you<br>such a sense of of self accomplishment<br>of self- Pride it's really a wonderful<br>wonderful<br>opportunity so for those of you that are<br>embarking on the doctoral journey I just<br>thought after a year and a half of this<br>I'd give you a couple of heads UPS on<br>things that you could perhaps take home<br>with you and the first is there's the<br>doctoral induction day and if you've<br>heard of that I encourage you to do it<br>straight away um for many students is<br>part of your provisional year goal it<br>actually is a compulsory day that you<br>attend but many students leave it just<br>before you have to hand in your<br>provisional year review form and they<br>think ah a day on City Campus and if<br>they go and it's this huge ddge but<br>actually it really it's such an<br>informative day if you go right as soon<br>as you're enrolled um as soon as you<br>hand in those forms or as soon as you<br>get your acceptance done really sign up<br>for one of those doctoral induction days<br>they are so so<br>helpful um and also to establish a<br>really good rapport with your<br>supervisors I had no idea that the two<br>people that are supervising my research<br>project would be so important to me just<br>to to set the boundaries from the<br>beginning the how what where and why of<br>your research meetings um try and figure<br>out the boundaries of how you submit<br>work how you going to receive feedback<br>all those things get those things sorted<br>out in the beginning and really make<br>sure that you have a lovely relationship<br>with your<br>supervisors personally I found that the<br>first year is quite an awesome year<br>because you have provisional years I<br>think if if we've got a bunch of<br>teachers here you all know how much we<br>love to kind of get the ticks off the<br>to-do list and kind of you know the<br>happy smiley faces at the end of your<br>ethics and then your research proposal<br>um but I've really found this doctoral<br>calendar that you can get from The<br>Graduate Center or you can make your own<br>is really valuable and as you can see<br>this is this is my research journey and<br>I'm kind of halfway now and there lots<br>of ticks and crosses and things and I<br>think honestly if I tell you the truth I<br>haven't achieved one thing in the time<br>frame that I wanted to but it's just<br>part of the journey and you just realize<br>more and more that this is a Growing<br>Experience there're going to be times<br>when you are just abolutely full of<br>Jubilation and they going to be times<br>when you're in the depths of depression<br>it's just one of the most exciting are<br>ious to the end because you're<br>passionate about it and because you're<br>doing something that you really<br>love um and Orland University is just<br>fantastic there are such a wide range of<br>support services for students um first<br>of all Mavis ha and her team that the<br>postgraduate block you block make sure<br>you go there smile and introduce<br>yourself because that's an area where<br>you're going to be in often um don't be<br>afraid to ask questions the staff there<br>are so so helpful if you're lost or<br>confused rather than spending 3 hours on<br>the website trying to find your way<br>around just go pop in and ask a question<br>they are the most helpful and supportive<br>people um also the sub Librarians oh my<br>goodness they have been amazing and go<br>and find yourself hook yourself up with<br>a subject librarian and make friends<br>with you take her coffee or something<br>and get in your good books because<br>really the amount of information they<br>can share with you and how they can just<br>make it so much easier I have kind of<br>email alerts now once a week I get all<br>the latest data on on my resarch topic<br>just on my Gmail account it's just<br>fabulous instead of spending hours and<br>hours trying to research and they're<br>there to help you set up all these<br>things and just make your research<br>Journey<br>easier um lastly for a more social note<br>don't allow yourself to be isolated um<br>not many people are really into my<br>research topic Val's education in South<br>Africa but I really found that that coll<br>that collaboration and that inter<br>relationship thing that you can build<br>with other students is is vital to the<br>research Journey we've just started an<br>informal research mix and mingle group<br>that meet once a month we are all doing<br>completely different things I'm PhD we<br>have many B honor students that are<br>undertaking a research component PG dips<br>Master students and the the information<br>that's coming out of that collaboration<br>is just amazing I'm learning things from<br>B honest students about how to you know<br>classify your work how to analyze your<br>work how to just keep things in order<br>and it's just an amazing way just make<br>your research Journey more meaningful to<br>you um I'll be back at our block after<br>this and please feel free to come and<br>chat to me if I can give you my email<br>address or I'd love to help you it's<br>just such an exciting time and well done<br>to you for taking the step on<br>postgraduate steud and I wish you all<br>future oh welcome everybody I don't<br>think I need to much Mel he did a great<br>job with the subject libr that's just<br>what I was going to talk about one other<br>the things um welcome congratulations on<br>your decision to study postgraduate work<br>um and if you haven't quite decided that<br>maybe we can tip you into to a decision<br>my name is Chris Mosen I'm um one of the<br>subject Librarians over the cation in<br>the library and this is s Bradley who's<br>another one um and the reason that Su is<br>not on there was that originally she<br>wasn't going to come with me and then we<br>we bring somewhere else and she I'll<br>come over and have a talk um to the<br>students as well so um I don't to speak<br>spend too much time with you tonight<br>about Library services but just to say<br>that we are called the silver AC War<br>Library we're based just over there and<br>by all means come and um have a look<br>around we think we've got fantastically<br>good resources there for you and I'll go<br>through some of those in a moment but I<br>thought you might enjoy seeing syvia<br>that's her on the right hand side there<br>and a couple of pictures of her and her<br>Heyday teaching this this one here on<br>the left top she's actually in um United<br>States and this one lower down here<br>that's got actually a little piece cut<br>out of the corner of it is her uh early<br>days teaching on the East Coast um and<br>this color photo which was we we took<br>last year at the um International<br>Conference of silation um stiner this is<br>her family uh and it includes all of her<br>children and her grandchildren and um it<br>was a great it was a great occasion we<br>need to celebrate the time that she was<br>here so um that's who she is and that<br>that's who we named after so um we we<br>hope we're doing well at the moment so<br>come over and have a look at the place<br>you enjoy it there's also a silver on a<br>corner over that looks a little bit uh<br>looks at her history and the sort of um<br>the teaching and you know the writing<br>that she do as well so<br>soia um if you come to study here you'll<br>become part of the University of Oakland<br>and you'll have access to all of the<br>library collection not just the<br>collection that's here in terms of<br>education and just a few steps there to<br>say a little bit mindblowing actually I<br>think I mean what are you going to do<br>with 79,000 electronic journals but<br>however they are there um and just to<br>say that you have access to an enormous<br>range of material particularly if you're<br>researching um I'm doing a little bit of<br>postgrad study myself now and um I<br>there's there's almost too much stuff<br>there but it's it's absolutely fantastic<br>if you're wanting to do a little bit of<br>research if you're doing um um T classes<br>same thing uh we're there for for for<br>you to come to us we're more than happy<br>to um spend time with you helping you<br>work out how to get through um The Maze<br>texts um what can we offer you well<br>print collections electronic collections<br>we've talked about um a lot of our time<br>at subject libraries are spent doing um<br>information literacy<br>instruction a little bit of teaching so<br>guiding you through the best way through<br>to use a those resources subject<br>Librarians I'm probably not going to say<br>too much more because melan's talked a<br>lot about that but subject Librarians do<br>like have very special role with<br>postgraduate students and try and<br>establish a personal role with you so<br>that you can feel free to give them a<br>call make an appointment coming for a<br>consultation so don't hesitate to do<br>that and of course we are also trying to<br>provide services for flexible students<br>and a lot of you if you're doing<br>postgrad doing postgrad diploma in<br>particular you might be doing flexi<br>studies which was what I'm doing even<br>though I'm here um so again we're trying<br>servic yes Ma and I'm going to head over<br>to soon now she's going to talk a little<br>bit about subject Lins there's only five<br>of us so<br>um yeah this my<br>SC there probably quite a few years of<br>experience that there already willing<br>and able to help you um if you decide to<br>so we actually really love what we do<br>and we we love the special relationships<br>that we do establish with um<br>postgraduate students and I was just<br>thinking perhaps we could have changed<br>this slideshow and just put our recipes<br>for coffee what we like double shot<br>latte or you know black white or<br>something like that but we're here to<br>help you um in either individual or<br>small group um research consultations we<br>can arrange time so if you're busy at<br>work we can arrange to meet you um after<br>school um come into the library to see<br>us um we can help you um conduct your<br>search strategies um to develop<br>appropriate search strategies each the<br>databases or to use the search<br>interfaces that we have multi database<br>searching or our fantastic new catalog<br>that we have um and we can just help you<br>find the way through that Maze of so<br>much stuff that we have for you which we<br>just we just love anyway and of course<br>we can help you um with a bibliographic<br>software manager called end note which<br>is what we use um in this particular<br>University Library to help you manage<br>your citations is anyone here using end<br>already is the m of<br>Interest enjoy using it great it it is a<br>great tool and for those of you who<br>don't know what I'm talking about and<br>you um decide to undertake your studies<br>you will get to and it's a fantastic<br>tool for you and<br>uh and yeah much much more we help<br>students without any information<br>technological bone in their bod so it's<br>amazing to see people sometimes when<br>they first come in and degree you know<br>unsure and and how they progress and<br>develop and Blossom and become really um<br>sly researchers in their own right and<br>and that's just our job and we love<br>doing it so welcome to you those who do<br>decide to continue on this halfway and<br>come and see us in the library we think<br>we're pretty<br>you good evening everyone I've been<br>given about very many minutes to get<br>some information across to you but I'm<br>really happy to be here I'm quite<br>excited because um talking about<br>scholarships is a prospect that can<br>become a reality<br>for all of you very much like what melan<br>said she's a commonwealth scholar and<br>there are a heap of opportunities<br>available at the University of Oakland<br>and there
