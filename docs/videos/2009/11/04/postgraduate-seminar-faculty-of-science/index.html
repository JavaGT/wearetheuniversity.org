of<br>experiences that we can offer you and I<br>just really hope that you find the<br>session today interesting and<br>informative please make use of all the<br>people from The Faculty of science that<br>are around here they're here to help you<br>to talk to you give you what information<br>you require and uh hopefully tell you<br>some of the things the Departments are<br>doing and we've just got three very<br>brief Little Talks uh today it's sort of<br>been organized on the basis of seniority<br>I think so what we have is we have a<br>recent PhD graduate Dan hikaro here uh<br>we've got a slightly less recent PhD um<br>graduate Debby Hayes who's also going to<br>talk to you and a slightly less recent<br>recent uh graduate Professor Margaret<br>brimble is also to talk to you so<br>without further Ado I'll just pass the<br>mic over to Margaret I think I get the<br>you get<br>the so age means you get start first so<br>I'm the old person here here to tell you<br>why you should be doing postgrad so I<br>thought I'd just start with a bit of a<br>personal perspective I actually studied<br>languages at school did Latin French<br>German and maths no chemistry and I<br>really only discovered chemistry at<br>University but I really didn't know what<br>it was all about until my MC year so in<br>our MC year we got to work in the laor<br>labories and we got to make compounds<br>and in my particular area which is<br>Medicinal Chemistry we got to make<br>potential new medicines so it was really<br>at that stage that MSC year or honors<br>year that I got to just to actually find<br>out the creativity of the subject that<br>I've been studying and the theory of for<br>many years so I was putting the theory<br>into practice but it was the hardest<br>year of my life even now I look back it<br>was still the hardest year of my life<br>harder than the year that I had a baby<br>and still tried to keep working and um I<br>really at the end of that year felt like<br>I was going to stop and just go take my<br>BC than thank you that's enough<br>University and go and go teaching but I<br>didn't I stayed on for the MC year then<br>I went and got a comma scholarship went<br>to the UK to do a PhD and then came back<br>to New Zealand as an academic and so I<br>get to teach at University level as well<br>as do research and I'm very grateful for<br>that opportunity I get to run a really a<br>good research group working with some of<br>New Zealand's most talented students I<br>also contribute to the New Zealand<br>science Community now and that I'm<br>cheering the Rutherford foundation and<br>cheering the maen fund panel the<br>physical science engineering panel and<br>for those of you that have<br>business-minded I do actually have to<br>get into the commercial world and that I<br>do commercial work using my medical<br>chemistry applying that using that<br>working with biotech companies we<br>actually have a drug in phase three<br>clinical trial with urine<br>Pharmaceuticals that the Walter Reed<br>Army Institute of research invested $10<br>million in and it's in phase three the<br>trials are underway at the moment so<br>looking back now why would I tell you to<br>co and consider and do postgraduate<br>study well it's not actually all the<br>great cumers that I did in my case uh<br>the reason why I think you should do a<br>PhD or an honest year or MSC is that<br>it's at that stage that you actually get<br>to to focus on your project so you you<br>you become the driver you take responsib<br>for the project you learn to be<br>independent highly organized and<br>demonstrate initiative well some of you<br>do most of my students do but more<br>importantly at this stage in your life<br>you get to you you actually do get to<br>focus on your project 100% and that's<br>something that I look back now and say I<br>wish I could just be doing my PhD<br>project it's something that you'll miss<br>certainly when you're my age because you<br>get faced with very many distractions<br>and interruptions and can't just get the<br>job done in my case I did actually get<br>to work on a project with enormous<br>benefit to Mankind and that my students<br>and I are lucky and that we get we work<br>on designing and developing new drugs to<br>treat cancer viral disease neur and<br>neurogen diseases like outs so that's<br>real that real social good aspect of the<br>work we<br>do when we're doing that work however<br>you actually get to make lifelong<br>friends you may even marry a fellow po<br>pogrant I did and I currently have three<br>couples in my research group met during<br>their phds and one couple are actually<br>expecting their their first child in a<br>few months so you also gain a lifetime<br>Mentor not just a postgrad advisor<br>several of my female PhD students have<br>had children and we still keep in touch<br>and we exchange photos Etc and I even<br>stayed with my PhD supervisor in the<br>cotwolds a few weeks ago in the UK my<br>PhD supervisor from dare I say it 25<br>years ago and so that really has been a<br>lifelong kind of mental for<br>me you also established Val professional<br>networks many of my friends from my PhD<br>days I still keep in touch with one is a<br>fellow professor of organic chemistry in<br>the UK and we're organizing a big<br>International Conference in Egypt um in<br>our field I see him regularly when I go<br>to the UK and it certainly makes those<br>long flights um worthwhile when I get to<br>catch up with him and a lot of my other<br>friends and one of my contemporaries is<br>also on they sit on many boards this one<br>of my friends is on the board of AGR<br>search and he helped me get a very<br>valuable research contract a few weeks<br>ago so that that Network those networks<br>actually do start from the postgrad days<br>what I also say to my students is you<br>can get a qualification and no one can<br>take that away from you get your PhD get<br>the better P bit of paper no one can<br>take that off you you can go and get a<br>great job really highly paid job<br>everybody's really impressed with the<br>job you've got but you could get made<br>redundant and you lose that but they<br>can't take that degree off you and<br>finally I think a really another reason<br>why you should do a PhD I certainly did<br>my degree here at Oakland had never left<br>New Zealand de I say never been to the<br>South isand and stepped off the plane in<br>the in England in the middle of winter<br>to start my PhD<br>nowadays however our PhD students they<br>travel enormously they have to get in<br>touch with with the International<br>Community in their field and so they're<br>often going overseas you know at least<br>once a year I'm traveling to composes<br>and learning valuable communication<br>skills which is also another good reason<br>for doing a PhD so join up whatever<br>subject focus on a subject that you<br>really that you really want to do your<br>your know and your heart's what you want<br>to do and that's what you should pursue<br>not what someone thinks you someone else<br>tells you that you should be<br>Dan would you like to car<br>on kill but maybe I'll can you all hear<br>me down the back not a fan of of these<br>things um as alen said my name is Dan<br>hior and I I finished a PhD at the<br>University of<br>Oakland four years ago now um I won't<br>say that I was sort of Someone Like You<br>standing in an audience like this at the<br>final part of my degree because I sort<br>of had to make a decision that I had to<br>do postgraduate because I'd mocked<br>around for too much in my bachelors so I<br>said right I'm going to go back and do<br>my masters and work really hard and<br>apply myself properly and um and get a<br>good grade and and get that piece of<br>paper like Margaret mentioned that meant<br>I could step up to the to the job world<br>and say here I am I I can do some stuff<br>um so I I had plan to come back and do a<br>masters I was somehow Hoodwinked into<br>doing a PhD but but the hook was my<br>master supervisor had a PhD project that<br>involved work in<br>Antarctica so I was like well okay sure<br>I'll do that work if no one else is<br>going to do it so I got to do a a<br>research project in Antarctica with the<br>British Antarctic Survey but it was<br>based here at the University of Oakland<br>and as Margaret said it meant I had a<br>lot of international travel with with<br>with my postgraduate work here and um I<br>I I came out of that with with quite an<br>amazing um project but what I did find<br>was when I was at conferences and<br>meeting with people and workshopping<br>with people that um a key thing that<br>that really let me sort of punch above<br>my weight so to speak was the really<br>well-rounded um education I received<br>here at the undergraduate and then at<br>the Master's level and and perhaps the<br>message I'd like to give to you all is<br>that um I know there's some big<br>university names out there the<br>cambridges the oxfords and stuff but<br>from my perspective it was the training<br>I received here at the University of<br>ockland that me and I could go and visit<br>people who had been at those<br>institutions and I was fearing at an<br>equal footing with them or even better<br>as a result of the um the world-class<br>expertise and training that that I'd<br>received here so so that and very short<br>as as a brief summary of why why I did<br>my postgraduate research because i' sort<br>of enjoyed University maybe a little bit<br>more than I should have been studying at<br>University but what has that got to do<br>with you guys and I think maybe the<br>relevance for you and even though I<br>didn't see it at the time was that um<br>the reason I got to do that awesome<br>project was that my supervisor was good<br>buddies worth the head of the British<br>antartic survey geoscience and he needed<br>someone to do the project so it was the<br>people here it was their linkages and it<br>was their International recognition<br>which allowed someone like me to step up<br>and become part of of of this amazing<br>world of<br>research another great thing that I<br>think why you should be considering<br>doing postgraduate research and and even<br>here at the University of ockland is<br>that it has always always keept Pace<br>with with the different changing um the<br>changes and the waves that run through<br>the research I know this when I started<br>my degree here this building didn't or<br>this um Annex down the back of us didn't<br>exist and the universities recognized<br>the need and I think when a university<br>can recognize that there are new needs<br>in different niches then it's only good<br>for its students particularly the ones<br>that want to come through and do a lot<br>of postgraduate<br>work since that time and and that PhD<br>was in geology and I was I was mapping<br>some of the rocks down there um but the<br>broad base of of of my Master's level um<br>training I did here has allowed me to to<br>Branch out now and I'm actually doing<br>work as as varied as doing an Industrial<br>Way site Rehabilitation on one hand and<br>then with another group I'm doing some<br>geothermal development and I think<br>that's another one of the um the strong<br>cases that I would make for studying at<br>the university university of Orland is<br>that like Margaret said you all know out<br>there what what you what really drives<br>you and what you're passionate about and<br>and I was lucky enough to find out ear<br>on that I I sort of was really driven by<br>Earth system science and and Earth<br>Science and it was it was the teams and<br>it was the different skills that I was<br>that I was built that I learned sorry<br>and and the teams that I built and<br>worked in at the University of ockland<br>that that have put me in this position<br>now where I can I can command and I can<br>do the type of work that I want to do um<br>and achieve the sort of projects that I<br>want to achieve and and and for my<br>personally it means I get to sleep well<br>at night I'm not working on Amazing<br>drugs but I'm I'm working on creating<br>economic turnarounds for for um low<br>socioeconomic um communities down in the<br>Bay of Plenty I'm working on an<br>industrial weite Rehabilitation so um my<br>advice to you all is is to find your<br>passion and then go and speak with these<br>folk around here I'm certain can give<br>you great advice and um I would<br>certainly recommend the University of<br>ockland has been a great place with a<br>lot of diversity that is world class and<br>its research capabilities so thanks very<br>much<br>you want the<br>mic I'm not sure can people hear me do I<br>need the<br>mic no okay good suits me um so firstly<br>I hope you'll forgive me from reading<br>from my notes here but um when I give a<br>lecture or a scientific presentation I<br>don't seem to need them but talking<br>about my life I seem to need them like<br>go figure anyway when asked to talk to<br>you today at first I really didn't know<br>what to say how could I Enlighten you<br>about postgraduate study this got me<br>thinking firstly I realized that I<br>started my PhD almost a decade ago this<br>was a little alarming but I also had the<br>opportunity to remind myself why I did a<br>PhD from a young age I always had an<br>interest in science I would collect Tad<br>Pooles and keep them until they turned<br>into frogs I would keep caterpillars and<br>hope they would change into<br>butterflies snails were a particular<br>favorite did you know that the common<br>garden snail is a good swimmer<br>so when it came to choosing subjects for<br>higher level study biology was certainly<br>there I had a harder time choosing an<br>undergraduate degree but pharmacology<br>essentially the study of how drugs<br>affect the body and how the body affects<br>drugs sounded<br>interesting after two years of this<br>pharmacology degree at Sheffield<br>University in the UK I was given the<br>opportunity to apply for what was known<br>as an industrial<br>placement several of the top<br>pharmaceutical companies offered a<br>limited number of positions<br>each year where students took a year out<br>from their degree and worked essentially<br>as an employee of that company I was<br>fortunate to be offered a position by<br>what was at the time known as Glo<br>welcome now GSK incidentally Glo started<br>as a milk powder production company in<br>New<br>Zealand I have to say that I was a<br>little surprised to be offered the<br>position because my second year grades<br>were not what could be called First Rate<br>perhaps they had fewer applicants for<br>the Department I applied for who knows<br>what matters is I've never looked<br>back in that year I worked on new drugs<br>for asthma screening them at their<br>cellular targets called receptors I had<br>a wonderful time playing with all kinds<br>of expensive fancy equipment and being<br>paid well to do it at the end of the<br>year I went back to my degree with<br>renewed enthusiasm consequently<br>achieving much better<br>grades at the blink of an eye my degree<br>was over and I needed to decide what to<br>do next GLA welcome had offered me a job<br>in the department I'd previously worked<br>but I was also considering doing a<br>PhD the Glo job would have paid well and<br>would have been interesting it was very<br>tempting but in the end I chose Freedom<br>the freedom to pursue my own ideas I<br>chose to do a<br>PhD in the pharmaceutical industry you<br>were governed by many things beyond your<br>control I preferred the thought of<br>academic<br>freedom so I looked around for a project<br>I'd enjoyed working on receptors at Glo<br>so I sort of project in that area one<br>that appealed was on a type of receptor<br>that had just been discovered it meant<br>there was a huge amount of scope for<br>research in that area I applied and was<br>called to interview I have to admit that<br>the interview was a little intimidating<br>a panel of six firing questions at me<br>slightly excessive for a PhD interview I<br>thought but then this was Imperial<br>College London one of the top<br>universities in the world so perhaps It<br>Isn't So<br>surprising I also had the chance to talk<br>to my potential supervisor one-on-one<br>his current students other members of<br>the lab and to look around the lab that<br>is something that's definitely worth<br>doing you need to get a feel for whether<br>you're going to get on with them<br>otherwise it could be a<br>disaster but I like my supervisor and<br>the lab and the panel obviously thought<br>that I could do the PHD so I was offered<br>the position and I accepted so I moved<br>to London to embark on my postgraduate<br>research PhD completion time in Britain<br>is pretty strict I had 3 years worth of<br>PhD stipend so I worked hard to do my<br>research and complete my thesis in that<br>time frame I think I handed in about a<br>week after my 3 years was up what really<br>helped was that my supervisor was very<br>supportive in encouraging me to write up<br>my results as I went along in<br>Publications I ended up with five papers<br>for my PhD which made the writing at the<br>end much<br>easier it wasn't all plain sailing<br>though my supervisor actually got a job<br>in the pharmaceutical industry after<br>only 18 months of me starting I couldn't<br>go with him and there was no one in my<br>department that worked on receptors so I<br>wasn't in an easy<br>position however my supervisor and I<br>worked through the options and in the<br>end I decided to remain registered at<br>Imperial College but complete my<br>research in the laboratory of our<br>collaborator at another<br>University it was quite an upheaval<br>moving Labs but in the end it worked out<br>really well and having no formal<br>supervisor on hand every day gave me<br>even more freedom this isn't always such<br>a good thing though because you need to<br>keep on track so that you finish on time<br>but at that time it was good for me so 6<br>and a half years later after finishing<br>my PhD I run my own lab have PhD<br>students of my own two of whom are just<br>writing up their thesis and continue to<br>pursue the research that I began almost<br>a decade ago I'm still as passionate<br>about it now as I was then and I am glad<br>that I chose this<br>path it feels odd to be saying this and<br>it could be considered a little arrogant<br>but I'm sure the fellow researchers will<br>understand that I am a world expert in<br>my albeit Focused Field of research at<br>31 is a pretty special feeling<br>postgraduate study has put me in this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
