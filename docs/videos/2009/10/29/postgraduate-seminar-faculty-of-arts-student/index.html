automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi um you're a lot of people bit scary<br>but all right um as Steve already said<br>Steve is my main supervisor um as he<br>already said I'm from Austria I'm doing<br>a PhD at the department of sociology and<br>um my the degree system in used to work<br>very differently than it does in New<br>Zealand and all over the world pretty<br>much so what I was looking for once I<br>had my degree from at home was um to get<br>a degree that actually recognized<br>internationally so could get a job um<br>and I wanted to get it from a good<br>University um that's all the<br>expectations I had pretty much um but<br>what I'm getting here is uh a lot more I<br>am meeting new people all the time<br>probably meet a lot of new people here<br>that haven't met so far from The Faculty<br>or students I also meet people from<br>different disciplines coming from<br>different backgrounds with different<br>experiences I able to work as a tutor<br>this year I'm responsible for the<br>learning of 100 students um sometimes it<br>seems like more of<br>them I've also contributed to the<br>research work of our head of department<br>and of other staff members it's quite a<br>pleasure to hear them mention your work<br>when they're presenting whatever they<br>came up with afterwards at a conference<br>and I have the luxury to read ridiculous<br>amounts um and it is a luxury because if<br>you're out in a workplace you usually<br>can't do that when you're starting out<br>on your undergraduate degree you're<br>learning the basics of your trade but as<br>a postgraduate students you actually<br>have a lot more intellectual Freedom you<br>get to choose your focus of interest of<br>the things you are interested in most<br>you can direct your research assignments<br>or your essay assignments to greater<br>extents than as an undergraduate student<br>um all the while knowing that if you<br>need help and support your<br>lecturers staff members will give it to<br>you all the time that I actually spent<br>here at Oakland University I noticed<br>that things are changing quite<br>considerably um of course students and<br>University are faced with more<br>challenges and more so today with these<br>economic uncertainties that we don't<br>really grasp most of the<br>time um so education and the skills that<br>we develop and the knowledge we gain are<br>becoming more and more important but<br>also the university is faced with<br>challenges it needs to adapt to a<br>changing world to changing employment<br>situations it has to adapt the courses<br>the degrees but also the services they<br>offer to us and to me as a student um<br>the success as a student is not just<br>about passing a paper or to hand in a<br>thesis and get a degree at the end but<br>also to be prepared for the world out<br>there and I have to say I did not really<br>get that from my previous degree but if<br>I look at the courses that the Student<br>Learning Center and also The Graduate<br>Center are offering it becomes quite<br>clear that actually these things do<br>matter here at o<br>University we do need skills not just<br>academic skills but also we need<br>information on how does the system<br>actually work what can we do with our<br>degree particularly if you have an arts<br>degree which it's not always apparent<br>what we do afterwards so courses that<br>Student Learning Center and Graduate<br>Center and the library offer are not<br>just about academic<br>skills when I started out my degree um I<br>took pretty much everything that was<br>offered library and uh the learning St<br>Learning Center I took courses on mind<br>mapping which became very handy when I<br>started to write out my first chapter<br>did a course on speed reading which was<br>at times very depressing because it<br>turned out that I have a lot of reading<br>habits that actually really slow me down<br>so I was able to work on that improve<br>there but I also took part in courses<br>that were immediately helpful like on um<br>end note and also to get the most out of<br>word but that's not all of course other<br>courses they offer is really um<br>something of importance when it comes to<br>our careers for example um I attended<br>some courses seminar days<br>where people from within the university<br>were invited but also from outside the<br>university and they talk to us about<br>their experiences as re researchers and<br>they shared with us what the different<br>employers actually are looking in um<br>graduates from<br>universities so they inform us on what<br>we actually need to know about how<br>things work how do we get a job how do<br>we get<br>published<br>so if you are actually deciding to<br>continue with postgraduate studies I<br>encourage you to get involved in your<br>department it was very um important to<br>me to actually do join things in the<br>department not just work like tutoring<br>and being a research assistant but also<br>social Mets um for example last we year<br>I organized a group of students we also<br>included undergraduate students to shoot<br>a documentary on child poverty in New<br>Zealand so it's not just again about<br>academic skills but social skills and<br>skills that you might need outside of<br>University get to know your staff and<br>get them to know you because that might<br>open up quite a lot of opportunity is<br>not just in the short term but also long<br>term um you might already be aware that<br>the postgraduate degree is not that<br>cheap particularly if you are an<br>international student but um there are a<br>lot of funding resources out there and<br>it's um might literally pay off for you<br>to actually go to the Scholarship office<br>and talk to somebody get their advice on<br>matters um another matter that should be<br>mentioned is the post-graduate student<br>Association they are the people who<br>represent our um voice and our needs um<br>within the university system one thing I<br>really enjoy that um pgsa is organizing<br>every year is exposure it's where we<br>postgraduate students can actually<br>present our work that we're doing in our<br>offices all year long to people from<br>outside the department outside the<br>faculty and we actually can win quite<br>cool prizes another thing thing that<br>pgsa is doing is they're organizing cool<br>parties I think they had one just last<br>week um where there's free food cheap<br>drinks and good<br>music I would also like to remind you<br>that the more you talk to other people<br>um the better your chances are to sort<br>out what you want what the world outside<br>needs and how you get there I really<br>would like to remind you to talk to your<br>postgraduate adviser within the<br>department but also don't be afraid to<br>talk to your former tutors and also talk<br>to other postgraduate students within<br>your department just knock on their door<br>they might frown at you for a moment but<br>usually we are quite friendly so also<br>don't hesitate to talk to me as we<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
