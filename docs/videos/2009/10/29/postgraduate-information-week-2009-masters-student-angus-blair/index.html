accurate.</p><p>are all the students enjoying the free<br>drinks tonight<br>fairly good way to start the evening i<br>think friday night<br>i'm not gonna lie my favorite thing<br>about these events is that i get to come<br>dressed up because as a post graduate<br>student i don't have to wear a tie to<br>work every day which is a fantastic<br>experience for anyone who spent some<br>time in the workforce so<br>excuse me if i've overdone it a little<br>bit tonight<br>now i'm a fifth year student i'm a<br>master's student and it's my second year<br>at the university of auckland business<br>school i actually graduated from massey<br>university a couple of years ago and<br>decided to come to auckland um not just<br>for a change but also for the increased<br>challenges and a few more opportunities<br>to come my way as well<br>now um when i was given this gig i was<br>actually told there are five things that<br>i should probably talk about and one of<br>those things was the research i did<br>but you see the first lesson that i<br>learned when i got to postgraduate<br>studies was that you should generally<br>avoid talking about exactly what it is<br>that you research on other than with<br>those people that you spend time with<br>so people would normally come up to me<br>and say well what do you studying tell<br>me about your master's thesis<br>me i look at leadership perspective<br>drawing on the sociology of culture by<br>giving attention towards elevating<br>leadership as a strategic and moral<br>imperative which tempers the<br>predominance of social psychological<br>accounts of leadership and raises<br>questions about the links between<br>culture consciousness and social<br>structure<br>but pretty soon i realized that everyone<br>thought my work sounded interesting it's<br>quite reminiscent of when my mother used<br>to found my healthy privy business<br>interest in transforming robots<br>interesting as well<br>but as with all things worth doing you<br>generally get a lot more than you<br>bargained for and your postgraduate<br>experience is going to be no exception<br>to that<br>the thesis that you actually study as<br>it's been pointed out is going to be an<br>exceptionally small part of the overall<br>learning experience it certainly has<br>now the first lesson i got after<br>figuring out that people didn't actually<br>want to hear about the details of<br>organizational discourse surrounding<br>culture cultural construction and virgin<br>acquisition was that<br>i didn't work anywhere near hard enough<br>during my undergraduate experience<br>so does anyone here remember what it was<br>like in your first year of university<br>when you looked back at your high school<br>days<br>and you're like<br>nine to three<br>i could have been doing so much more<br>what was i doing with all my time<br>i've got some bad news for you all<br>it pretty much feels exactly the same<br>when you get the postgraduate experience<br>and i look back at what it was doing<br>during my undergrad years and went wow i<br>really could have been making a lot more<br>of that<br>because for a second i just want i want<br>everyone to think about the intellectual<br>transformation that has been the last<br>three to four years for for the students<br>anyway<br>and i want you to realize that<br>that intellectual transformation is<br>really just the first step<br>in a long way and that this next one<br>year let alone the next three you'll see<br>just as large a change in the way you<br>observe the world and the way you make<br>sense of things around you<br>so<br>one of my heroes said that we should all<br>try to look for smart people and hard<br>problems<br>now these smart people tend to always<br>clump together<br>so when you find one of these clients<br>it's usually a good idea to enjoy it<br>join it and postgraduate experience has<br>definitely been one of those clubs for<br>me<br>the second part of his advice is that we<br>should all try and find hard problems<br>because they're generally the ones worth<br>working on and the ones that draw the<br>most satisfaction<br>now<br>reading research is easy writing<br>research is hard so it's generally<br>pretty easy to see which one of these is<br>going to be more worthwhile for you over<br>the final thought i'd like to leave all<br>the undergraduate students here tonight<br>is that someone has picked you to be<br>here there's a person in your faculty<br>who thinks that you are better than you<br>think you are<br>now that person is probably a lot<br>smarter than you are so i'm going to<br>take their word on it and you should too<br>because there are so many people in this<br>so few people in this world today that<br>are willing to challenge the way things<br>are done<br>to break new ground make a difference<br>and do something a little less<br>conventional<br>so i don't want you to take postgraduate<br>studies<br>because you don't know what you want to<br>do with your life though that may be the<br>case as well<br>and whether you're an idealist who wants<br>to change the world or pragmatist who<br>just wants to be a bit better at what he<br>does or if he does have a crazy<br>intellectual itch that needs to be<br>scratched consider joining me for<br>postgraduate studies next year and i<br>promise you won't forget it first<br>semester</p></main><footer
