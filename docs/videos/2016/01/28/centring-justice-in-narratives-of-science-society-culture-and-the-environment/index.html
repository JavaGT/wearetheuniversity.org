Peter<br>Gibbons whose wisdom guided my early<br>days as an associate dean in the Faculty<br>of Arts and Social Sciences emeritus<br>professor dick Bedford who as deputy<br>vice-chancellor research in those days<br>was always willing to read and reread<br>Marston grant proposals dr. Patrick<br>Barrett for being a wonderful Co<br>supervisor code researcher and now a<br>brilliant chair of the School of Social<br>Sciences professor david mckee who<br>manages to find me a thriller to read<br>just when the pressures of work get<br>overwhelming professors robin long hers<br>Linda Johnston and Rachel Simon Kumar<br>feminist allies and Friends associate<br>professor sandy Morrison and hien a team<br>or on a green cyl for their support the<br>inspiring members of the environmental<br>sustainability committee of the<br>University for all of the work that we<br>do together and my many students and<br>research collaborators both here in New<br>Zealand and around the world equally<br>importantly I thank the close circle of<br>friends who have shared in the joys and<br>sorrows that life offers and whose<br>support has been an integral part of my<br>life I know I've missed many in this<br>rather short and list although you might<br>have thought it rather long but if you<br>are here you know who you are so thank<br>you again for all coming out tonight let<br>me begin with a short story it was a<br>sweltering hot sunny afternoon in 1988 I<br>was in the Indian state of Gujarat<br>close to cavalia colony the site where<br>one of the largest dams in the world was<br>going to be built the crowds were<br>gathering villagers tribal peoples or<br>our devices as we say a few police<br>scattered here and there and a handful<br>of activists it was a fairly small rally<br>at least by Indian Standards about 500<br>people or so although the numbers are<br>kind of blurred after 27 years a petite<br>woman began to address the crowd she<br>spoke about large dams being planned on<br>the river Narmada the displacement of<br>people that would take place the<br>submergence of forests and land that<br>belonged by right to the adivasi peoples<br>and the lack of any compensation from<br>the state it was a powerful speech and<br>one that had a huge impact on me the<br>speaker was made her partner a<br>charismatic and brilliant activist who<br>would go on to lead the narmada bachao<br>andolan or saved the narmada movement<br>she also was to later win the right<br>livelihood award or the alternative<br>nobel prize as it is called I was a<br>journalist then and little did I know<br>that I was witnessing the birth pangs of<br>a social movement that would go on to<br>transform the very development project<br>in India in fundamental ways but<br>listening to Mayda I realized what now<br>seems so obvious the intertwined and<br>symbiotic relationship that binds<br>environmental protection social justice<br>and the development project that inside<br>coupled with a sense of watching<br>democracy at work profoundly shaped my<br>thinking although I didn't realize it at<br>that time I was hooked on the idea of<br>sustainability indeed as I reflect on my<br>research over the last 20 to 25 years it<br>seems clear that the enduring element in<br>all the twists and turns my life and<br>work have taken<br>a concern for the multi-faceted concept<br>of sustainability now it's true that<br>sustainability is a term that is so<br>widely used so endlessly used in fact<br>that many have dismissed it as an empty<br>buzzword what's worse is that the term<br>has been systematically marginalized<br>undermined and even colonized really by<br>the powerful consumerist right-wing<br>business and political lobby groups it's<br>time we reclaimed it there is no other<br>term I believe that has the power to<br>capture the multiple dimensions of<br>Environmental Protection social justice<br>cultural diversity politics and good<br>governance as sustainability does each<br>of these dimensions refracted to the<br>prism of feminist politics has been a<br>central focus of my work so in the talk<br>that follows I share some of my stories<br>of research on the struggles over the<br>meanings of nature development and<br>science stories that are at heart about<br>sustainability diversity and social<br>justice<br>let me go back in time to the small town<br>in central India where I spent my early<br>childhood Pillai was a microcosm of<br>India and growing up there was an early<br>lesson of the seeming possibilities for<br>the happy coexistence of diverse<br>cultures faiths and practices an<br>identity constructed around race or<br>marginality was not in my vocabulary<br>while growing up we were all Indians<br>unity in diversity was a slogan we all<br>grew up with in the 1960s and 70s in<br>India there was a sense of a shared<br>national project of creating a new<br>independent India where religion caste<br>and regional identity was secondary to a<br>common struggle to build a prosperous<br>country this myth which many of my<br>generation cherished has in many ways<br>imploded in recent years especially in<br>the face of the oppression faced by the<br>our diversity peoples as well as the<br>reality today of a right-wing Hindu<br>fundamentalist government which has set<br>about systematically undermining the<br>syncretic pluralism of India through<br>attacks on minority communities and the<br>rewriting of history but the patterns of<br>religious fundamentalism neoliberal<br>economic exploitation and resource wars<br>that are currently taking place in India<br>are part of the larger global discourses<br>of colonization and new corner<br>colonialism that I take a critical look<br>at I'll fast-forward through to the<br>mid-1980s when i joined the times of<br>india as a journalist in Mumbai I did<br>what junior reporters do covering the<br>city beads writing stories that I was<br>assigned to and working very long hours<br>but I also started to slip away on<br>weekends to write about issues that were<br>starting to matter to me around<br>struggles over water and destructive<br>large dams and meanings of development<br>in rural India in fact it was on one of<br>those off the beat New<br>rounds that are encountered the protest<br>movement against the world bank-funded<br>narmada dam project that i mentioned<br>earlier a couple of years into my<br>journalistic career came a series of<br>serendipitous events that changed the<br>direction of my life in profound ways I<br>was given an opportunity to go on a<br>six-month visit to a newspaper in New<br>York City to Manhattan and then through<br>another series of happy developments at<br>the end of that period I was given a<br>scholarship or an assistantship really<br>to graduate studies in political science<br>in purdue university in the US i decided<br>to take the chance and stay it was a<br>leap of faith with only my journalistic<br>curiosity to keep me company I didn't<br>have much of an idea about life in the<br>US and even less so of the world of<br>academia I soon got the hang of the<br>strange world of super-sized burgers and<br>a million choices of the kinds of breads<br>to order for a sandwich traffic that<br>flowed in seemingly opposite directions<br>and lights that came on when you<br>switched them off and turned off when<br>you switch them on but what took a bit<br>of time to understand was that my<br>identity itself was undergoing a<br>transformation I couldn't take things<br>for granted anymore I was no longer a<br>person like anyone else or so I thought<br>I was a third world er I was no longer<br>just a woman I was a woman of color at<br>this time of internal and intellectual<br>ferment I soaked in the works of black<br>women writers the novels of zora neale<br>hurston Toni Morrison and Alice Walker<br>the poems of Maya Angelou June Jordan<br>and audre Lorde and the essays of<br>patricia williams Alice Walker Angela<br>Davis and bell hooks gender ethnicity<br>race and class were not merely<br>intersecting structural realities but<br>worked with and against each other I<br>realized<br>how we understand an act on our desires<br>for equity justice fairness truth and<br>beauty is inevitably shaped by our<br>experiences of the structural and<br>emotional realities of the societies we<br>live in this realization served as a<br>feminist passport for me to travel<br>across time place and disciplines this<br>passport took me not only from India to<br>the US and eventually to our tour over<br>New Zealand but also allowed me to<br>explore how power plays out in a variety<br>of contexts around issues of the<br>environment development and<br>sustainability over the last three<br>decades two decades or two and a half<br>decades really three central issues have<br>underpinned my academic work the<br>centrality of gender in environmental<br>sustainability the complex implications<br>of culture and difference for social<br>sustainability the democratic governance<br>one of the most exciting things that<br>happened to me when I embarked on<br>doctoral studies was the extraordinary<br>privilege of being able to work with<br>Robert V Bartlett a pre eminent scholar<br>of environmental politics who did<br>pioneering work on ideas of ecological<br>rationality environmental impact<br>assessment and deliberative democracy<br>and Lynne Kathleen whose work on<br>feminist politics and policy analysis<br>was deeply influential suddenly I could<br>begin to theorize the citizens movement<br>against the narmada dam for example that<br>I had been reporting on in India so<br>began my doctoral journey and the<br>genesis of my first book and a research<br>agenda on gender and environmental<br>sustainability the movement against the<br>narmada dam spanned the local regional<br>national and international realms in<br>terms of its spatial reach it brought<br>together our devotees farmer<br>environmental and human rights activists<br>it was led by a charismatic articulate<br>woman made her Parker whom I had met<br>back in 1988 and it was remarkably<br>successful in not only capturing the<br>attention of the international media and<br>international non-governmental<br>organizations but also in being the very<br>first to have forced the world bank to<br>withdraw from funding a large-scale dam<br>project ever the conflict in the narmada<br>valley was over the waters of the river<br>and the forests and the lands in the<br>submergence areas of the dam where the<br>adivasi saw nature not just materially<br>as a source of their survival and more<br>fundamentally as pivotal to their<br>identity as a people and this in fact is<br>something that closely parallels Maori<br>understandings of a Papa and links<br>with nature the state and rich farmers<br>and industrialists saw the water as a<br>resource the forest as something that<br>they could replant somewhere else and<br>the displaced people themselves as<br>dispensable in the larger cause of<br>national development for their effort<br>those who opposed the dam were<br>castigated as being anti-national and<br>anti development so my book engendering<br>the environment gender in the World<br>Bank's environmental policies offered a<br>particular kind of intervention rather<br>than take the path already taken<br>brilliantly by anthropologists<br>sociologists and economists I examined<br>instead the gendered nature of policies<br>that could in the name of the Holy Grail<br>of development destroy people's homes<br>lives cultures and lands such<br>destruction and violence was also<br>layered an interwoven around issues of<br>class race and gender tribal women poor<br>women and single women for example were<br>the worst of I argued in the book that<br>it wasn't just that development policies<br>environmental policies and social<br>policies deliberately disadvantage<br>many categories of women but that they<br>were imbued with what I described as<br>masculine values and so when I say<br>masculine values I'm not referring to<br>men as such rather I'm pointing to the<br>dominance of certain kinds of values<br>certain kinds of knowledge errs and<br>certain ways of being that historically<br>have been identified with the privileged<br>position of dominant men in society in<br>contrast indigenous knowledge the<br>knowledge of the soft social sciences a<br>focus on culture lived experience and<br>relationships are all deemed feminine by<br>Western society such a distinction is<br>important for two reasons masculinity<br>and femininity are not to equal<br>categories one is privileged more than<br>the other second the power implications<br>of this also has an impact on access to<br>resources on who has legitimacy and<br>whose voices are heard a significant<br>focus of this book in a number of<br>articles that preceded it was a critical<br>analysis of this thing called<br>environmental impact assessment or EIA<br>now EIA is hailed as one of the most<br>transformative policy innovations of the<br>20th century so I undertook the first<br>ever feminist gender analysis of eia to<br>show how I eia theories processes and<br>practices were inherently masculine in<br>the knowledge asst and the values that<br>they endorsed I specifically looked at<br>how the World Bank CIA policies were<br>implemented in the third world and<br>around the same time as my book I<br>co-authored with Robert Bartlett an<br>article on the implicit theoretical<br>models of eia which has become a<br>touchstone for all writing on EIA ever<br>since so my project in essence<br>exemplified the fundamentally complex<br>nature of sustainability it demonstrated<br>that there is no pure environment or<br>nature out there environmental<br>protection and<br>sound economic development can only<br>happen when social justice is centered<br>as the environmental justice movement<br>has pointed out often in the past they<br>can be no nature without justice and no<br>justice without nature but equally<br>importantly nature culture relations and<br>the sustainability project are<br>fundamentally gendered as I argued then<br>and i continued to think that this is<br>this has in this in fact holds true the<br>dominance of masculinist values in<br>environmental and social policy<br>jeopardizes the goal of sustainability<br>there were other difficult questions<br>that I was left with after writing this<br>book how do we imagine and reimagine the<br>shape of sustainable development that<br>takes account of power difference<br>culture and agency addressing these this<br>question has driven my subsequent<br>research projects questions are on third<br>world development agency culture and<br>women led to an exciting collaboration<br>with professors kumkum Bob Lonnie and<br>John foreign of the University of<br>California Santa Barbara which led to<br>the publication in 2003 of a successful<br>hugely successful book really of<br>entitled feminist futures reimagining<br>women culture and development and in<br>2009 a volume called on the edges of<br>development cultural interventions<br>feminist futures laid the foundation for<br>a women culture and development or wcd<br>as the acronym asst paradigm which has<br>received significant traction and this<br>paradigm provided an exciting creative<br>space to explore with other scholars and<br>activists how culture is interwoven with<br>social practices and the second edition<br>of this book is forthcoming next year<br>the challenge of destructive development<br>that informed feminist futures also<br>catalyzed our next book on the edges of<br>development<br>the worst impacts of the environmental<br>and social upheaval in the wake of<br>resource exploitation is felt by the<br>most economically and socially<br>marginalized segments of society<br>everywhere the adivasis in india the<br>ogoni in nigeria the aboriginal peoples<br>of australia the remote communities of<br>papua new guinea for example on the<br>edges of development shows how<br>development is about access to resources<br>for survival and well-being and it's a<br>struggle that is at once cultural<br>political and ideological working on the<br>edges book also brought home to me that<br>the core and periphery was not a<br>straightforward binary there is a<br>dominant call with power within the<br>peripheries and there is a marginalized<br>periphery within the core so for example<br>the so-called developed nations have<br>huge pockets of the poor and<br>underprivileged and the incarceration of<br>black communities disproportionate to<br>their share of the population whether<br>it's in the United States or of<br>Aboriginal communities in Australia are<br>just some obvious examples of this and<br>similarly pockets of often corrupt<br>wealthy elite ruled the roost in<br>otherwise impoverished countries so the<br>politics of borders and the imperatives<br>of social sustainability was something<br>that engaged me when I came to New<br>Zealand so I spent a year at the<br>University of California Santa Barbara<br>as a dissertation scholar and then<br>finished my PhD at Purdue University at<br>which point i was offered this job at<br>the university of waikato in 1996 1996<br>was an election year in New Zealand it<br>was also just nine years after New<br>Zealand had liberalized its white New<br>Zealand policies immigration policy so<br>immigration since 1987 was on the basis<br>of skills and the early 1990s had seen<br>the numbers of the draw the broad<br>category called Asian immigrants<br>increase<br>by March 1996 newspaper headlines were<br>screaming about a yellow peril and an<br>Asian invasion often quoting the leader<br>of a small populist party that I don't<br>need to name it became commonplace to<br>have people talk disparagingly about<br>Asian drivers or rich Asians inflating<br>house prices now does that sound<br>familiar by any chance you know and so<br>on the racist abused that I would face<br>almost daily as I walked from home to<br>the University was greeted with both a<br>sense of surprised that it should happen<br>and almost an instinctive denial it just<br>seemed so alien to the New Zealand way<br>of life but in us all in a small country<br>like New Zealand transcending the<br>barriers of nation race and class can<br>too often seem insurmountable as<br>research in New Zealand continues to<br>show having asian or non Anglo names can<br>be a significant deterrent in getting a<br>job but even with a continuing<br>appointment in hand I had to jump a few<br>hoops in the process of gaining<br>residency here I first had to prove to<br>amuse Zealand immigration services that<br>I could speak English in order to<br>qualify for permanent residency so I<br>tried to reason with the immigration<br>official that the University of Waikato<br>wouldn't have hired me to teach if I<br>couldn't speak English but hey this<br>wasn't about logic was it so I produced<br>my beer degree in English literature<br>from the University of Madras but that<br>wasn't good enough for the immigration<br>official it did not state on the degree<br>certificate that the medium of<br>instruction was in English and so I said<br>right that's okay I can deal with this<br>but my MA and PhD certificates were from<br>Purdue and a top-ranked u.s. University<br>and so I produce those but that would<br>not do to<br>I finally got my rather bemused head of<br>department from Purdue to write a letter<br>to Immigration Services saying that the<br>medium of instruction at Purdue is<br>English so simultaneously My partner and<br>I found that we were regularly<br>complimented on our excellent English<br>perfectly ordinary conversations would<br>get interrupted by oh you speak such<br>good English exclamations so when we<br>probed gently it would soon emerge that<br>the interrupter and there were many<br>really well meaning people often people<br>that you encounter in the process of you<br>know going to the bank or somebody meet<br>on the streets but that they assumed<br>that because we look different indeed<br>looked foreign we could hardly be<br>expected to be fluent in English so<br>these experiences of anti-asian rhetoric<br>well-meaning condescension and the lack<br>of diversity in the workplace triggered<br>an interest in learning more about a<br>history of immigration in New Zealand as<br>well as learning about the Treaty of<br>Waitangi biculturalism and the history<br>of colonization in New Zealand the<br>politics of biculturalism in New Zealand<br>is such that there is almost an<br>exclusive focus on Maori Party relations<br>despite the presence of Indians and<br>Chinese in New Zealand from the mid to<br>the late 18th century until quite<br>recently there's been little academic<br>acknowledgement of their presence or<br>contribution to the social economic and<br>political fabric of the country and I<br>should point here to the doctrine work<br>by one of my PhD students dr. Todd naku<br>it's that offers documented historical<br>evidence of the presence of Indians in<br>our tarawa from 1769 having acquired an<br>Indian or minority identity marked by my<br>brown body during my years in the US I<br>found myself in New Zealand lumped into<br>this amorphous category called Asian a<br>category that did that that's deemed to<br>be somehow<br>the other I could also perceive a shaky<br>sense of national identity that was<br>reflected in an oft stated desire to<br>identify new zealand with the first<br>world and to distinguish it from the<br>third world so in a research project<br>debashish munchy and i showed that there<br>is what we call a discursive phobia of<br>the third world in new zealand despite a<br>well-deserved reputation for being a<br>largely tolerant society in the face of<br>rapid social and cultural<br>diversification in the last three<br>decades questions about what it is to be<br>in New Zealand ER and who is a New<br>Zealander continue to be debated the Val<br>arising of whiteness as a subtext of<br>national identity is something that has<br>been evident in media and political<br>discourse whether it is in Paul Henry's<br>questioning of our nents at the onions<br>fitness to be the Governor General or<br>the resistance by the state to increase<br>the refugee quota in sort of recent<br>times our analysis of the ways in which<br>the third world is deployed in New<br>Zealand shows how widely accepted across<br>the political spectrum is the<br>construction of the third world as<br>inferior and negative and I want to<br>acknowledge the work on this project by<br>Rebecca Fraser who participated in the<br>larger project that we were in so if you<br>were to take a look at just a few<br>examples of the hundredths that we found<br>in our sample we have I have some of<br>the elements of race ethnicity and<br>difference hidden under the layer of the<br>term third world thus come through in<br>studies on discourses around immigration<br>around the same time as immigration was<br>a hot topic in New Zealand there was<br>another contentious issue polarizing<br>society genetic modification which<br>became also the research focus of one of<br>my then masters students Jeanette right<br>Debashish mansion I decided to explore<br>if there was anything in common between<br>the issues of immigration and genetic<br>modification on the face of it there<br>were two very different issues but we<br>wanted to delve deeper and study the<br>discourses of genetic modification and<br>immigration it turned out to be a bigger<br>project interestingly we found that both<br>of these discourses shared common<br>anxieties about the protection and<br>breaching of a range of boundaries<br>particularly national cultural political<br>and genetic ones diversity was at the<br>heart of them both policy changes taking<br>place in the early 2000s aimed at<br>tightening immigration criteria making<br>them more restrictive and loosening<br>procedures for genetic modification by<br>lifting the moratorium on the release of<br>genetically modified organisms or GMOs<br>in essence both these policy moves were<br>about reducing diversity in immigration<br>the intent was to reduce ethnic<br>diversity and in GM it was about<br>reducing biodiversity to the creation of<br>monocultures what was particularly<br>intriguing about the policy moves on the<br>two issues was that policy makers appear<br>to be moving towards the rigid<br>boundaries option in the case of<br>immigration but was more inclined<br>towards the flexible boundaries option<br>in the case of GM and so this got us<br>thinking more deeply but the complex<br>intersections between the social and the<br>sign<br>toufik and subsequently led us to a<br>what we saw in the case of GM was that<br>despite tremendous societal opposition<br>to it policy making processes appeared<br>inadequate to respond appropriately to<br>the challenges of this technology what<br>then of technologies such as<br>nanotechnology which are still so new<br>that there is little public awareness<br>about them the absence of adequate<br>information in the public domain about<br>these new technologies has triggered you<br>topic and dystopic narratives which<br>raised more questions than answers if<br>these technologies hold sway what would<br>it mean to be human who would have<br>access to these technologies and with<br>what consequences for us these questions<br>also demonstrate that new technologies<br>emerging on the scientific frontier pose<br>a fundamental challenge to planetary<br>sustainability and require rethinking<br>the meaning of citizenship it is in this<br>quest that debashish and I immersed<br>ourselves in an interdisciplinary<br>project on sustainable citizenship that<br>focuses on theorizing the intersections<br>of sustainability and citizenship in the<br>context of decision-making on new<br>technologies part of the impetus for<br>this research came from the fact that<br>current scholarship on citizenship has<br>not really grappled with the<br>multi-faceted challenges of<br>sustainability so this is a website that<br>was set up for our project and which has<br>all of you know the research that's come<br>out the presentations the papers the<br>team etc so a project funded by a<br>Marsden grant moved away from treating<br>views on new technologies in<br>oppositional terms it's not really very<br>productive to think of it in terms of<br>good and evil rather we wanted to see<br>how we can foster public engagement and<br>better decision-making through a clash<br>of ideas rather than through routine<br>dialogues<br>so one of the reasons why new<br>technologies have sparked conflict is<br>because policymakers and politicians<br>have historically chosen to defer to the<br>power of scientific rationality<br>expressed by the technical elite in<br>making decisions in other words policies<br>are framed that affect the many but are<br>informed by a few as a result many<br>groups of citizens and the diversity<br>they bring with them have been simply<br>absent in any kind of democratic<br>decision making so the key questions for<br>us were how can we incorporate public<br>engagement in formulating public<br>policies on new technologies how do we<br>find common ground among the polarities<br>that are there we figured that we had to<br>go beyond just routine dialogues that<br>are often favored by policymakers<br>dialogues have their uses but they do<br>not always adequately address power<br>imbalances amongst diverse public's so<br>we drew on two very different<br>methodological approaches q sought<br>surveys and deliberative citizen panels<br>to locate shared values through a clash<br>of ideas in the first part for the Q<br>sort we pull together a list of<br>statements that reflected diverse range<br>of views on new technologies we then got<br>people representing different beliefs to<br>think through and deliberate on these<br>statements and then prioritize them and<br>through this process of doing the<br>cue-shot survey we found that underneath<br>the differences was a significant common<br>ground that people were willing to work<br>on in the second part we use citizen<br>panels for deliberations and issues of<br>new technology we wanted to see with<br>regard to nanotechnologies in use in the<br>New Zealand context whether and in what<br>ways traditionally marginalized groups<br>such as Mari and young adults would<br>respond what we learned from these<br>panelists was fascinating one story in<br>particular struck us as deeply<br>insightful when the Maori panel<br>discussed nanotechnology they pondered<br>what it might mean to have their<br>traditional wood carvings done on<br>materials strengthened by nanotechnology<br>it could mean that sacred carvings could<br>have a significantly extended life which<br>was an exciting possibility but then as<br>they deliberated more they reflected on<br>what it might mean to have carvings at<br>last a long time maybe forever what the<br>younger generation want to or even need<br>to learn the traditional skills of<br>carving if carvings never deteriorated<br>what had happened to culture and<br>traditions when technological innovation<br>undermined the passing of passing on of<br>intergenerational knowledge in the case<br>of the youth panel made up of young<br>adults between the ages of 20 18 and 24<br>we found that many of the participants<br>were amazed by the fact that we even<br>wanted to hear their views what matter<br>to them was not so much the pros and<br>cons of new technologies but what they<br>called the real issues of Employment and<br>survival and they had divergent views<br>among them too who decides on which<br>technologies should be used for whose<br>benefit young people want to say in<br>shaping the world they are to inherit<br>but their input Israeli acknowledged so<br>what our project showed is that<br>sustainable citizenship is about<br>collective action for an inclusive<br>society it's less about establishing a<br>consensus on an easily applicable<br>framework than it is about acknowledging<br>divergent perspectives and engaging with<br>them productively collective action<br>becomes possible through allowing a<br>clash of ideas amongst widely divergent<br>perspectives so our work on the<br>sustainable citizenship project has been<br>widely published in a number of leading<br>journals and in June this year Debashish<br>and I were invited to do a TEDx talk on<br>this topic which was a little<br>nerve-wracking but a great deal of fun<br>and in that talk we covered some of the<br>highlights of our projects that I just<br>discussed the recognition of the<br>fundamentally intertwined nature of<br>environmental sustainability social<br>justice and cultural context which has<br>been at the heart of my previous work is<br>altered the center of my current project<br>on climate justice with my research<br>collaborators Debashish munchie kumkum<br>Bob nonny and John foreign funded by a<br>Rockefeller Foundation grant our project<br>is a recognition that the crisis of<br>climate change which threatens the lives<br>and livelihoods of vulnerable peoples<br>around the world needs radically new<br>social political and cultural<br>interventions we began the project with<br>a three-day symposium on climate futures<br>in bellagio Italy in July 2015 bringing<br>prominent public intellectuals<br>scientists and interdisciplinary<br>scholars together with policymakers from<br>governments and grassroots climate<br>activists from every continent to search<br>for fresh ideas for realizing better<br>climate futures that symposium provided<br>a dynamic interface for people working<br>on different aspects of climate change<br>second it also created a space to<br>develop new approaches that highlight<br>the need for centering climate justice<br>in the global climate negotiations of<br>2015 and it's aftermath this work leads<br>into a book project and climate justice<br>that we are currently working on today<br>marks a significant milestone in my<br>academic journey and as I said at the<br>start this is the journey that had not<br>taken alone I've had the privilege of<br>working not only with some amazing<br>research collaborators around the world<br>and in New Zealand but also with many<br>extraordinary PhD masters and<br>undergraduate students some of these<br>students are now top notch academics<br>themselves scattered around New Zealand<br>or the globe some others have gone on to<br>become policy analyst community workers<br>parents and above all good citizens<br>of the world many of them have been<br>involved in research projects with me<br>over the years and these have often been<br>incredibly exciting exhilarating<br>learning experiences for me so I'd like<br>to acknowledge in particular Rachel<br>salmon Kumar verities aruba Raven Emmett<br>Hume Johnson Jeanette right Todd naka<br>wits guru nanaka sanguine to Graeme<br>McKenzie llamame ever made Rebecca<br>Bullard Megan Smith and Amy Nina's some<br>of whom are here today and there are<br>many many other students who have<br>touched my life in profound ways I also<br>want to acknowledge shema Hamilton<br>ethnic women's center trust an<br>organization that I helped set up about<br>14 years ago and which I'm honored to be<br>a part of in many ways shamma represents<br>the hopes and aspirations of ethnic<br>women in the waikato and the coming<br>together of commitments to social<br>justice diversity and inclusiveness in<br>essence sustainability that ultimately<br>is what all of my work has been about I<br>want to end with the words of June<br>Jordan as we contemplate how we enact<br>sustainability in our life work we are<br>tanaqui Priya deposition family to<br>Naruto everyone thank you very much for<br>attending tonight to hear Priya's<br>extraordinary journey both personal and<br>intellectual the two are wrapped up so<br>beautifully I think in the way you've<br>presented this to talk through from your<br>time as a young journalist in India<br>still as a journalist in the US and then<br>slipping into academia and through that<br>route coming to New Zealand and over<br>that whole journey their environment has<br>mattered social justice as well and<br>wrapped up into development studies and<br>sustainability all as you say viewed<br>from a seven-point through the feminist<br>prism and taking on board the centrality<br>agenda in economics policy development<br>development studies the gendered nature<br>of that policy but also as you came to<br>New Zealand opening your eye it opened<br>your eyes to the issues of migration and<br>I can't resist saying that those of us<br>who actually migrated here from England<br>and by definition spoke English still<br>could not be understood it hidden it's a<br>curious place for that overall I think<br>no me that you that wraps up into the<br>idea of national identity which of<br>course as today is part of the debate<br>about the flag and what does that mean<br>and what goes into it through the<br>referendum but also the way your<br>trajectory has gone as you described it<br>through to sustainable citizenship<br>climate change and citizenship and while<br>you describe that as a trajectory I<br>still see it coming back in full circle<br>to where you started with the whole<br>issue of your place as an individual<br>within the environment and within<br>society as such and while there's been<br>an element of serendipity and what's<br>happened to you how you ended up for<br>instance in the u.s. how you in<br>up here there is I think still that<br>strong thread through their of the<br>intellectual development that has drawn<br>you threw down down that path ladies and<br>gentlemen can you please join me in<br>thanking Korea for what's been a<br>this concludes the formal part of the<br>evening the discussion can continue<br>afterwards and pre will be available<br>afterwards I'm sure to take questions<br>the bar will be open but again can I<br>thank you for attending tonight and look<br>forward to seeing you again at future in<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
