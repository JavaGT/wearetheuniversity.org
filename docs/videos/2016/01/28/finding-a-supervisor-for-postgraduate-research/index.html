Three-Minute-Thesis winner Ian Randall talks about his supervisor/student relationship.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>choosing your research topic or<br>supervisor will be key to your success<br>as a postgraduate researcher the student<br>supervisor relationship will shape your<br>work for the next few years and beyond<br>whether you're working closely with one<br>supervisor or as part of a team<br>these are working relationships that<br>will support and guide your research<br>extend your thinking and help you<br>develop international networks I started<br>out as a geology student and I really<br>enjoyed studying geology but while I was<br>working through that my my supervisor<br>then suggested that he really enjoyed my<br>writing and I considered science<br>journalism so I jumped from geology to<br>being a science journalist while I was<br>studying how to do that we got into the<br>academic study of journalism and I<br>discovered I really enjoyed that as well<br>so with my PhD I guess I wants to<br>combine those two interests and look at<br>how geology is portrayed in the media<br>Ian's topic is one of the most unusual<br>PhDs I've supervised because it's part<br>humanities in part sciences and that<br>involves different supervisory styles in<br>different ways of writing that I have<br>had to come to learn to trust him and to<br>trust the co supervisor we're both<br>interested in Ian's best interests so I<br>from one point of view sue from the<br>other and so far it's been great you<br>know ian has to work quite a lot because<br>he's self-funded and so we're always<br>balancing that versus him moving forward<br>with his tasks I've been really lucky<br>with sue and Cathy in many ways they're<br>not just my supervisors they are their<br>like friends and we have a really good<br>working relationship and we can always<br>have a good laugh about the funnier<br>aspects of our research and I think<br>that's really important it's the most<br>important part of the supervisor<br>relationship is that you get on I do<br>discuss my expectations of the student<br>with them I do let them know that for<br>example I'm not going to chase them<br>around in terms of logistics and<br>administration at the University they've<br>got to drive that one because they have<br>to learn the ins and outs of their own<br>PhD regarding what the university wants<br>from them I'm here to help them with<br>science<br>I'm here to help them with managing how<br>do you take something that's gigantic<br>and overwhelming for some people and<br>break it into just the right amount of<br>pieces without losing track of where<br>you're going and that is really my main<br>job to make sure that they're still on<br>track that we've got a schedule that<br>makes sense I do think it's important<br>that the student takes ownership of the<br>work and puts things in their own words<br>but it is also my role as supervisor to<br>say this is not as well expressed as it<br>might be have you thought of<br>such-and-such for me the most important<br>part of being a supervisor is to get a a<br>PhD done as well as that candidate can<br>do it completed in time to meet the<br>deadlines to enable them to go on and<br>have an oral and then become a doctor<br>for me the most pleasurable things the<br>relationship you establish so that I<br>have friends now who used to be PhD<br>students and also seeing new knowledge<br>being created I find that really<br>exciting<br>I found the application process quite<br>simple getting in touch with the various<br>departments and getting allocated a<br>supervisor I had some back-and-forth<br>with the media studies liability measure<br>Kafka and we talked about my proposal<br>and then it was introduced to my<br>supervisors and we looked for a<br>supervisor to have support in geology<br>before I met Ian I knew absolutely<br>nothing about paleontology he has made<br>sure that I have a rock in my office and<br>this is a 22 million year old bivalve<br>that we found on my and he has given me<br>a beginner's guide to fossils yes if I<br>was going to give advice I think I would<br>say that it's really important to be<br>passionate about your topic<br>I've been described as being a little<br>obsessed with my research<br>it was probably fair I think it's really<br>important the PhD is a long journey and<br>if you don't have that kind of<br>engagement with it then it's going to<br>difficult so it's really important to<br>have a passion for your study and be<br>really dedicated to it for a new student<br>coming into a supervisory relationship<br>my best piece of advice would be keep<br>your supervisor informed my best piece<br>of advice to students when selecting a<br>supervisor really comes from my own<br>experiences doing that very same thing<br>many years ago but also having<br>supervised 60 grad students post-grad<br>students here I think you've got to have<br>some kind of a rapport that you<br>establish it's all very well and good<br>that the person is an expert they don't<br>have to be so I think when you're<br>selecting a supervisor ask other<br>students what's it like having this<br>person as a supervisor do you feel like<br>you're getting your needs met when you<br>get to a crossroads you know how do they<br>react do they disappear or or do they<br>show up and help you if they don't know<br>what to do what do they do the<br>University of Auckland is recognized as<br>having the greatest depth and breadth of<br>research activity of any university in<br>New Zealand and it offers a wealth of<br>research opportunities before you apply<br>I
