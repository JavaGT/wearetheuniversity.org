stage<br>over<br>Vice Chancellor Hannah colleagues ladies<br>and gentlemen thank you very much for<br>coming along tonight to hear my talk um<br>on medical education um that has been<br>highlighted by the the title you have<br>there generally um in overal lectures<br>are about people's research um history<br>and I've certainly spent the last 20<br>years in my academic life uh research<br>and Health Service outcomes particularly<br>as um Alisa has said around diabetes and<br>cancer outcomes but my other passion has<br>been around medical education um and the<br>importance of that to helping develop<br>the workforce of the future so that's<br>what I want to talk to uh tonight<br>um particularly I want to to say a<br>little bit about my own history in<br>medical education I want to talk about<br>the history of medical education in<br>general because I think it's important<br>to get an understanding of the the<br>hierarchy if you like of medical<br>education um I'll talk a little bit<br>about medical education in New Zealand<br>um and then talk about some of the<br>workforce challenges that we are facing<br>um at the moment um and hopefully just<br>briefly talk about some of the Poss<br>Solutions um that we would like to look<br>at so I trained at the RO free hospital<br>in London uh we were one of 12 medical<br>schools at that time 10 of those were<br>independent medical schools working with<br>hospitals and only two of them were<br>attached to universities we had 70<br>students in each year it was the royal<br>free hospital school for um medical<br>school for women and only allowed men in<br>in the 1950s and so all of ours like d<br>Sher Sheila Sherlock and Dame Josephine<br>Bars were our um senior academics um the<br>the rugby photograph is that the first<br>question you were asked when you arrived<br>was what position do you play because<br>the inter H scho rugby cup was a very<br>important part of the program one of the<br>other interesting things was when I<br>qualified um you qualified as mbbs from<br>the University of London or you could go<br>off and and um do your College of<br>Surgeons or College of Physicians exams<br>or even the LSA with the Society of<br>apothecaries and that was a very useful<br>backup because if you failed your final<br>exams you could still go work as a house<br>surgeon and never actually take the<br>final exams and that's relevant later on<br>when I talk about that I then did my<br>general practice training um and then um<br>spent time into kidy as aliser has<br>mentioned um which really was What<br>attracted me back to New Zealand<br>um we were the first students or the<br>first house surgeons to use the the new<br>accommodation block that John Mand know<br>so thoughtfully um built and provided um<br>and it was there that I published my<br>first academic paper on obric Services<br>um 1971 to<br>1980 following that as um was been said<br>I went to W where I started off as a<br>general practitioner but also became the<br>medical superintendent um and um last<br>child Steven who was a baby there and is<br>part of a for me to remember um but I<br>did spend five years in W worked with<br>the HS Bay Hospital board and then came<br>back to the white in<br>1988 um and there I worked with um Rex<br>right and CLA who was a a noted medical<br>academic particularly um expert on<br>medical history um but also uh well uh<br>Well published Community physician um<br>and Public Health Doctor um and again<br>Rex encouraged me to be involved in the<br>small Y in Academia um and later I was<br>involved in the setting up of the<br>diabetes program for um the white um<br>which led to my MD thesis on screening<br>for undiagnosed diabetes um in the wo um<br>Susie haing that photograph up but thank<br>you to Susie who actually did most of<br>the work on<br>TR um after being reorganized three<br>times in seven years and restructured I<br>thought I would scaped the restructuring<br>and took a job to write up my MD in<br>London and went to chain cross and<br>Westminster medical school and I've been<br>there for about nine months when I was<br>told that we were about to be<br>restructured um and we were merged with<br>um Imperial College of Medicine um with<br>the um Mary's medical school and the<br>post postgraduate Medical School en hman<br>um and that was a really interesting<br>time because I spent two and a half<br>years on curriculum committees<br>developing a new curriculum for what is<br>now probably the leading scientific<br>based um university medical school in<br>the UK along with Oxford and Cambridge<br>um and we had a very uh intensive<br>six-year program um which was as I said<br>very scientifically<br>based um during the re structuring we<br>were invited to move our department to<br>the University of s um and it was there<br>that we set up a postgraduate medical<br>school um we have<br>the the vice Chancellor there Patrick<br>daring um professor of diabetes David<br>Russell Jones and myself um and we had<br>a whole list of research that we were<br>involved in undertaking um and also set<br>up a number of taught postgraduate<br>programs for doctors in the area um the<br>other Escapade was the building of the<br>new um postgraduate Medical School<br>building which um certainly is not<br>something that um people want to get<br>involved in if they can avoid it at all<br>costs so might keep everybody happy with<br>a new building but the intent was always<br>to come back to New Zealand and uh 2005<br>I came back to the W as head of the W<br>clinical campus um uh and later<br>assistant retitled assistant them so<br>while that W um we set up the the W<br>weekend which is nowy weekend for Rural<br>medical students from Oakland which is<br>very much valued<br>um part of the calendar um I set up here<br>with Joe Scot Jones the rural<br>interprofessional program that is run<br>through fatani which involves<br>interprofessional learning with nurses<br>Allied Health um and Pharmacy students<br>um and was also involved in the uh<br>development of the public health<br>intensive program um and delivering the<br>reinvigorated curriculum so there's been<br>a lot of um academic involvement in<br>development of new culs over my<br>career what about the history of medical<br>Western medicine well we go back to<br>hypocrates um and the learnings from the<br>4th Century BC really trace a lot of the<br>the basis of the hipocratico which is<br>still taken by medical students today we<br>have there Ro of esus um surrounded by a<br>snake um and from the um uh Greeks we<br>then go to the Romans and U Claus galum<br>was one of the greatest writers in the<br>Roman Empire on medicine he was learned<br>as Anatomy because he was the surgeon<br>for the Gladiator school um as well as<br>being the um physician to Marcus Arius<br>um and I've always wondered why R Scott<br>didn't actually put galum into the<br>Gladiator<br>movie something that um should really<br>have been there because he was one of<br>the most famous Physicians of that era<br>but of course at the end of the Roman<br>Empire we lost um a lot of the learnings<br>from the Roman Empire and actually the<br>we of medical learning moved to the<br>Muslim World um the writings of Ali and<br>others on Al RI gave particular<br>descriptions of um small pox measles<br>petomy um and all of those learnings for<br>the next 3 or 400 years when most of<br>Europe was in what was called the Dark<br>Ages and it really wasn't until the 11th<br>century when um there was a Revival in<br>the learning of both the Roman and<br>Arabic literature into the<br>universities and uh here we have a<br>picture of a university lecturer um<br>reading allow the scripts of galum um<br>alrai and others and for the next four<br>or 500 years Physicians learned um by<br>wrote um their instruction in medicine<br>um and came out qualified from the great<br>universities of southern Europe Salerno<br>pad montellier and later Oxford and<br>Cambridge and it was really those<br>Physicians from those universities that<br>set up the first um College of<br>physicians in 1518 which were given um a<br>grant by Henry VII to control all of<br>Medicine um in London and then 1563 we<br>control of the medical practice um right<br>throughout the throughout England at<br>that time um and so the College of<br>Physicians really controlled the um uh<br>the role of medicine and essentially you<br>had to have qualified from Oxford or<br>Cambridge to become a fellow of the<br>college or if you qualified from another<br>University then you could become a<br>liens there were other health<br>practitioners at the time and lower down<br>the order were the the bar surgeons who<br>formed their Guild in 1540 um and the<br>surgeons did lots of practical things<br>like counting for cataract of the eye or<br>trining um or cutting for stone uh in<br>the leomy position which must have been<br>a very painful exercise but provid a<br>very common surgical procedure at the<br>time but the lowest rank would you like<br>were the apothecaries who were the<br>shopkeepers who um provided<br>prescriptions on the prescription of a<br>physician um and so were allowed to<br>dispense um their ures and and other<br>medines but only as I say on the license<br>of a physician very much like the<br>pharmacist of today and it's from the<br>APO that the um the role of the general<br>practitioner really got<br>established medical training really took<br>off in the 19 8 late 18s and early 19th<br>century with the development of the<br>teaching hospitals um and it was the<br>great teachers of today um s a Cooper<br>the great surgeon at guys Hospital<br>Thomas Addison who named Addison's<br>disease or tuberculosis of the adrenal<br>glands personal pots from Bart's<br>Hospital who pots fracture and pots of<br>disease of the spine and the great<br>anatomist and surgeon John Hunter from<br>St George's all of these do of medicine<br>would charge students a fee to come and<br>learn that their feet um and to walk the<br>Ws of those hospitals and get practical<br>experience of<br>medicine the paries were feeling a<br>little left out by all of this and so in<br>1815 they appealed to Parliament to also<br>be allowed to train and examine students<br>um and the apostrophes Act of 1815<br>allowed them to um set up their own<br>examinations so by 1858 there were a<br>whole plethora of<br>qualifications um available four doctors<br>um working in the United Kingdom at the<br>time um you could have a lensia of the<br>Royal College of Physicians the lrcp<br>which as I say lots of my colleagues<br>were still taken in the 1970s mrcf ins<br>surgeons um the LSA from the<br>apothecaries hall or the one that we all<br>really love you could get a doctorate in<br>medicine granted by the Arch Bishop of<br>C I think that's still on the<br>statute so we can you can see that by<br>this time in uh Victorian England there<br>were a pleora of hospitals particularly<br>in London um that were offering medical<br>training um and it was a very practical<br>apprenticeship um walking the Ws of the<br>hospitals the Americans went into the<br>same sorts of um programs um and by the<br>end of the 19th century there were over<br>150 medical schools of very variable<br>quality in the United States to the<br>extent that some were granted medical<br>degrees after 2 years of study um and<br>because of the the variation in<br>qualifications there was the flexman<br>report of 1910 commissioned by the<br>Carnegie Institute to look into the<br>aspects of medical training um and this<br>report has had a tremendous impact on<br>medical training in New Zealand and the<br>world um ever since um and flex not<br>essentially said that we should reduce<br>of<br>should reduce the number of medical<br>schools increase the prerequisites to<br>interent medal training but it was this<br>sentence here about training Physicians<br>to practice in a scientific Manner and<br>engage Medical faculties in research um<br>and also to give medical schools control<br>of clinical instruction um in hospitals<br>so that really had a as I say an impact<br>not only in the United States but<br>worldwide on how people thought medicine<br>should be<br>medical education should be followed<br>there has since then been some advances<br>or some changes to the medical education<br>this is Professor David sacket who I<br>attended one of his courses at Oxford<br>University back in<br>1995 um and he was one of the Dos of<br>evidence-based medicine and problem<br>based learning that came out of MCM in<br>the 1960s and has had a big influence in<br>the um the last 20 or 30 years on<br>medical education and a number of new<br>curriculum<br>worldwide um and what we are interested<br>in today is the idea of community<br>engaged medical education and this is<br>Professor Paul Worley from clintus<br>University who set up the Riverland um<br>experiment where they took students for<br>one year of their medical program into<br>general practice and Paul showed that<br>actually at the end of their 12 months<br>um in general practice the students<br>scored higher in their fifth year exams<br>than did those who had the tradition<br>program and so he established the<br>validity of um a different way of<br>training and that is now spread to<br>another number of other university<br>medical schools in Australia to the<br>Northern Ontario School of Medicine in<br>Canada um and to uh university medical<br>schools in Europe and UK and Portugal in<br>particular so what about medical<br>training in New Zealand um back in the<br>19th century all of our doctors were<br>important and they were a fair Fairly<br>variable Bunch so we have um William<br>cram from W who was a surgeon on Sailing<br>Boat got Shipwrecked off toan and ended<br>up in white for the rest of his life um<br>feon who would came out with the New<br>Zealand medical the New Zealand Society<br>to Port Nicholson became a very famous<br>um local politician arur purchas who<br>came out as a missionary in the manner<br>of David Livingston of the medical<br>missionary or um Thomas mo philson who<br>the philson library is named after who<br>came out with the British army so a<br>whole rag bag of different doctors who<br>came out um at that<br>time um but ATO did set up their<br>University Medical School very early on<br>in<br>1875 um and their their professor of<br>anatomy in 1877 was John Scott holiday<br>who then became the first dean of the<br>medical school um and they were<br>instructing students for two years in<br>science um before those students then<br>had to go off to Edinburgh for their<br>clinical training and it wasn't until um<br>1885 that um students were allowed to do<br>all of their medical training um in um<br>New Zealand this is leham Krispy who was<br>the first medical student um to qualify<br>as a fully qualified medical<br>practitioner from new<br>but it's the great Linda Ferguson who<br>was the dean um in 1914 to 1937 that<br>really established a TGO medical school<br>as it is um in many ways today so he<br>moved the curriculum from a 4-year<br>program to a six-year program um three<br>years of basic Sciences followed by<br>three years of chemical practice he<br>built the Great clinical sciences and uh<br>building to house all of that clinical<br>instruction um and very much set the Ty<br>of the flexan model of science based<br>research Le medical<br>education um Charles herkus was the next<br>theme um and with the rapid expansion of<br>the numbers um of medical students he<br>set up um campuses in Oakland and Christ<br>Church in Wellington um and also<br>introduced the idea of the first year<br>premedical um uh admission so taking<br>medical students into the second year<br>program to deal with great numbers of<br>people applying to uh into the medical<br>program at the<br>time but there was pressure for a second<br>medical school at that time and indeed a<br>third medical school and we have um<br>notes from the University of wad in 1970<br>that were competing with or to set up a<br>medical school but um the or medical<br>school was set up with the support of s<br>Brian Rob and um um sorry s Douglas Rob<br>and many of the do of Medical Practice<br>in Oakland in the 1960s and opened its<br>doors in 1968 to take 60 medical<br>students into their six-year program<br>modeled on that of the Targo and of<br>course the the Taro<br>um Outpost um closed in auction to allow<br>the medical program to exist probably<br>their greatest um achievement was<br>setting up the W academical Center um<br>with Peter Blackman now<br>professor of pet blman the chief science<br>advisor who was Dean of the medical<br>school at the time Tony car the chief<br>executive and Peter Rothwell who was the<br>first head of the the academic center<br>that has now become a clinical campus<br>today and in those days they took 24 of<br>the 106 um training interns into the<br>program on a cohort basis uh now there's<br>year so let me get back to<br>we have seen what the medical programs<br>are doing today we have highly<br>scientifically based programs at the two<br>medical schools but we still have um the<br>problem of Mal distribution of our<br>doctors um and also shortages particular<br>Specialties not only in rural general<br>practice but in many of our Hospital<br>Specialties as<br>well and we are facing a number of<br>issues around our Workforce there is an<br>increase in population we will be 5<br>million people in New Zealand by 2025 um<br>and maybe 6 million by 2050 but we also<br>have a rapidly aging population and by<br>2030 there will be a million people over<br>the age of 65 requiring health services<br>and it's because of that changing<br>demographic that this is the population<br>growth since 2000 around 15% but this is<br>the growth in medical doctor numbers um<br>over that same period of time to meet<br>the increasing Demand on the medical<br>system but at the same time we started a<br>primary care strategy around 2000 and<br>this is a proportion of our medical<br>Workforce that has gone into general<br>practice and and so we have a dilemma<br>where we are looking to provide more<br>community-based um Medical Care um and<br>yet our proportionately our<br>proportionate doctors in general prank<br>you and we can see this also this is the<br>output of the um medical schools from<br>uho in blue Oakland in red that in the<br>1990s something like 45% of uh doctors<br>who were qualified Geral practice but<br>that has been steadily shrinking down to<br>now around 15% of our medical output um<br>from two medical schools are going in<br>general practice and this is the aan<br>numbers and we can see from 1999 less<br>than 10% of male medical students um<br>have been going into general practice um<br>and around 20 % of those qualified from<br>um Oakland who are female have been<br>going into Dem so there's a real change<br>in the Ambitions of our medical<br>graduates I think the other thing that<br>we need to take into account and as an<br>international medical graduate myself um<br>it's really important to understand that<br>we're important to this country 1200<br>International doctors a year to meet the<br>health needs of the population this is a<br>wh report from 2008 pointing out that<br>we're the most heavily dependent country<br>on overseas trained doctors in the oecd<br>but also that we have high migration<br>rates of those doctors um and that the<br>sustainability of our health servic is<br>very dependent on our ability to track<br>overseas doctors um and this is the<br>proportion of International Medical<br>graduates in our rural areas well over<br>50% whereas in the urban areas a lesser<br>proportion International Medical<br>graduates so the graduates that we're<br>training are not going into general<br>practice and they are tending to stay in<br>the urban areas but depending on<br>International Medical graduates is not<br>sustainable um the majority 30% will<br>have left within 3 years so they're<br>coming from shortterm STS and overall<br>only one in five of those International<br>medic Gres will stay<br>work so as I say it's not just in um<br>practice that this causes issues we have<br>shortages in psychiatry in geriatrics um<br>in um itive Care and Rehabilitation<br>medicine all of those um Specialties<br>where there's not allowed Private<br>Practice um have a shortage of um<br>Specialists available from the current<br>medical training programs um and so I<br>rely on those overseas doctors so are<br>there any solutions to these problems<br>well I go back to the idea that has been<br>proposed in Australia and Canada the<br>community engaged medical program I've<br>been saying for a number of years that<br>if you want to train um people for the<br>um rural areas of New Zealand that we<br>have the wrong sorts of students into<br>the program we have the wrong curriculum<br>and we train them in the wrong place um<br>and unless we change that then there's<br>going to be a continuing problem so one<br>of the things that we're very keen to do<br>is to try and encourage um uh graduates<br>into the program um and more graduates<br>graduates will come into medical<br>programs and to go more likely to go<br>into general practice or the the<br>Specialties that I've mentioned um there<br>is evidence to show that if we take<br>graduates from the communities that<br>they're going to serve they're more<br>likely to go back to those communities<br>um and the community engaged programs in<br>Australia and Canada actually involves<br>the community in the selection of<br>students into their programs rather than<br>leaving to academics to decide on who<br>program there is the issue around the<br>curriculum um and this is a traditional<br>um Orland curriculum with lots of short<br>runs in highly specialized areas so this<br>is the tar the Northern Ontario<br>curriculum where all of the students<br>spend one year um in a rural community<br>engaged program<br>um and so that gives them time to get<br>adjusted and become useful working in<br>that environment um and um Roger strer<br>the dean of that medical school will say<br>that it's not so much what the doctors<br>in that Community can teach the students<br>but it's what the patients teach them<br>that is<br>important and finally where should we be<br>placing our students should we all of<br>their training be done in large ter<br>institutions um or this is the the<br>clinical campus where we were running<br>our rural immersion program um and<br>certainly the students very much<br>appreciated the opportunities to work<br>there and in like work that<br>environment I think the other thing that<br>I wanted to stress was that the Northern<br>Ontario model in particular talks about<br>the campus of the medical school being<br>the whole Community not the hospital um<br>and that um all of the communities are<br>engaged in the program and I was<br>recently in Northern Ontario and talk to</p></main><footer
