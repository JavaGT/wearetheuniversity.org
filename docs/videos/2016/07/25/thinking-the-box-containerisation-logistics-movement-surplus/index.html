think the box for the session I was<br>immediately taken to my research<br>encounters with shipping containers and<br>the ways in which they spoke to notions<br>of movement organization in surplus the<br>shipping containers I have encountered<br>have not been at sea horn ships foreign<br>ports instead I have come across<br>shipping containers in research with<br>migrant workers and the inland outskirts<br>of the seoul metropolitan region of<br>south korea what a shipping containers<br>doing in such places as in other parts<br>of East Asia in the Middle East shipping<br>containers are a common form of housing<br>for migrant labor retrofitted which<br>hotels and typically connected to<br>factories construction sites or other<br>workplaces while containers is housing<br>do vary in design these are not the<br>kinds of container architecture that has<br>become a fashionable statement of eco<br>consumption instead as workers in my<br>research put it these containers are and<br>I quote some here not comparable to a<br>proper house cold in winter and hot in<br>summer the rain can get inside there's<br>really no space just 20 square meters<br>but six people live in it my life is<br>always in the factory it's quite a<br>precarious or as one Filipino man<br>reflected there are some decent<br>container vans that are fixed up and<br>there are others that are really just<br>container vans and that's it you feel<br>like a piece of baggage stored inside a<br>container van the assemblage of migrant<br>container labor in Seoul and many other<br>major urban regions speaks most<br>apparently to a connection between<br>movement and surplus estimates vary but<br>as we've heard from Richard there are<br>literally millions of shipping<br>containers not only in use but also left<br>unused around the world often it is<br>simply cheaper to make new ones than<br>transport empty containers back to their<br>points of origin these are surplus<br>material from global trade based<br>capitalism in there more mobile<br>afterlife they become housing for<br>migrant populations who themselves are<br>arguably also seen as surplus to<br>requirements<br>or at least not in need of illegal<br>social and material rates the notion of<br>surplus population originally comes from<br>Marx and it can't classically refers to<br>populations that are superfluous to the<br>economy's average requirements<br>contemporary logistical capitalism<br>however often involves the discursive<br>and governmental construction of<br>necessary labour such as migrants as<br>surplus populations labour migrants like<br>those in Seoul and elsewhere are a<br>classic case of a constructed surplus<br>population because they are necessary to<br>the average requirements of the economy<br>and yet they have no permanent rates of<br>residents are expected to live marginal<br>lives and are not recognized as part of<br>society these surplus materials and<br>bodies in the reconfiguration urban<br>space are part of the wider<br>organizational impulses of logistical<br>capitalism a key feature of logistical<br>capitalism is a constant evaluation<br>reconfiguration and synchronization of<br>production and consumption operations in<br>time and over space labor too<br>particularly I think migrant labor is<br>subject to operate constant management<br>in terms of length of residents type of<br>occupation social rights as well as<br>formal and informal deportability in<br>short their prospects for life while<br>shipping containers draw my attention to<br>workers and soles periphery we should<br>recognize as christine has already done<br>that these rationalities work in New<br>Zealand to through the multiplication of<br>temporary visa these are opportunities<br>in this country and the differentiated<br>rights that many migrants then have<br>indeed immigration New Zealand now<br>approves hundreds of thousands of time<br>limited work and study visas every year<br>where individual migrants have limited<br>and graduated rights to work to be with<br>family access social resources and<br>establish viable lives often but not<br>always with the possibility of<br>permanence held out in the future these<br>time limits and regulations generate a<br>form of temporal containment temporal<br>containment is undoubtedly different in<br>its manifestation from spatial and<br>material containment of workers and soul<br>and elsewhere but it nonetheless forms<br>is informed by the same political<br>now you're similar political rationality<br>that the movement of people should be<br>managed and restricted for economic gain<br>or capital surplus these similarities<br>and discrepancies remind us of the<br>constant movement of the present moment<br>not just here but across the Pacific<br>Ocean they also i think point to the<br>ways in which movement on both sides of<br>that ocean is subject to forces of<br>logistical organization and in
