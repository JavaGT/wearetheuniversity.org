Forum.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks Frank this seems a little prosaic<br>after uh be of Beethoven's time of<br>course you noticed the high forward that<br>Beethoven had we all know that he went<br>deaf and he had an interesting bone<br>disease possibly called Pence disease<br>but unfortunately he didn't get a scx<br>ray before he died so that remains a<br>speculation but what I'm going to take<br>you through now is a sort of a 7 minute<br>walth through 20 years of work and about<br>20 years ago we started thinking it was<br>time some did a definitive study of<br>calcium supplements we all prescribed<br>them lots of people took them<br>self-prescribed and we all knew they<br>worked it's just that there wasn't any<br>hard evidence that they worked we all<br>knew they were safe though that had<br>never been documented either and there<br>were hypotheses that they might do other<br>things apart from making your bone<br>stronger and preventing fractures that<br>might be good for your heart and so we<br>decided we'd do a study um with the<br>support of the health research Council<br>that would address those questions um<br>and we called it the Oakland calcium<br>study and our principal hypothesis was<br>that calcium would prevent fractures but<br>we did have the secondary hypothesis<br>that calcium would reduce the incidence<br>of heart disease and there's some<br>evidence that people who come from hard<br>water areas and hard water is caused<br>amongst other things by having lots of<br>calcium and it um heav this heart<br>disease um and the's some evidence that<br>if you dose people up with calcium you<br>make their lipid profiles better so that<br>wasn't just something we plucked out of<br>the uh out of the thin<br>air um and so we recruited 44<br>1471 will volunteers from around the<br>Oakland region uh they were randomized<br>to calcium each day or to Placebo and<br>they took that for 5 years and the<br>primary endpoints as I pointed out with<br>fractures and bone density and then um<br>indices of hard Health um the funding<br>issue we want to get into the politics<br>of it is quite important this was funded<br>by the health research Council um and<br>that actually proved to be critically<br>important when we got answers that we<br>didn't want or expect because it meant<br>we didn't we weren't held hostage to<br>various commercial entities uh though<br>the calcium was supplied by a um an<br>American company and it's interesting<br>when we got to the critical break point<br>and we thought they were going to give<br>us a really hard time about what our<br>findings were we discovered that they<br>had divested themselves of that<br>portfolio which raises a number of<br>different and rather interesting issues<br>that we might need to talk about today<br>so just to quickly Leap Forward seven or<br>eight years from the planning stage to<br>the result stage this was the bone<br>density data and so we can see the<br>changes in bone density in percent of<br>BAS L over the 5 years of the study this<br>is the placebo group which as we expect<br>a normal postmenopausal woman lost bone<br>density and the people who were<br>randomized to calcium actually lost bone<br>density as well but at a slightly slower<br>rate uh but the difference all occurred<br>in the first half of the study we don't<br>know how early because we only measured<br>bone density uh the first follow-up bone<br>density was at two and a half years and<br>the difference is really quite small on<br>absolute terms it's about 1% which<br>doesn't sound like a lot and probably<br>isn't and in the second half of the<br>study um the the two groups really just<br>um paralleled one another fractures of<br>course is what matters a lot more and<br>this is where it starts to get<br>complicated so these are the percent of<br>people in the uh calcium group shown in<br>in blue and the placebo group shown in<br>Black over the five years who have had a<br>fracture and if you look at total<br>fractures there is no significant<br>difference between the groups the blue<br>line and the black line are all wrapped<br>up between one another if you're a true<br>calcium believer then you focus on the<br>forearm data where it seemed that using<br>calcium had reduced the risk of fracture<br>by perhaps one half and if you're a<br>calcium skeptic you focus on the hip<br>fracture data where the effect actually<br>went the other way and was rather larger<br>in magnitude and remains quite a<br>significant uh source of concern because<br>other studies since then have actually<br>found a somewhat similar finding so on<br>the basis of the bone data we concluded<br>that perhaps the fracture data was<br>inconclusive but there were positive<br>effects there with um bone density and<br>so it can't be doing any harm so people<br>might as well take it and then we moved<br>on and started looking at the uh heart<br>end points um and this is the data for<br>myocardial infarction so this is the<br>same sort of format as the fracture data<br>so the percent of individuals who've had<br>a heart attack over the five years of<br>the study and over the first couple of<br>years not really very much happened and<br>the line started to separate and did<br>actually separate in a statistically<br>significant manner the only problem was<br>it was the wrong way around and so we<br>found depending on how you do the<br>analysis a 30 to 40 % increase in the<br>risk of having a heart attack if you<br>were randomized to calcium so the<br>British medical journal had the courage<br>to publish that it caus something of a<br>storm um I myself thought if this was<br>really true someone would have found it<br>before then but of course no one had<br>ever looked before and of course if you<br>don't look you may not see and we<br>decided the only way forwards I mean the<br>definitive way when you get a surprising<br>or inconclusive result in a clinical<br>trials to do a much bigger clinical<br>trial but of course you can't um recruit<br>a whole lot of normal volunteers and and<br>say by the way our hypothesis is that<br>this tablet might give you a heart<br>attack and so we wrote to everyone who<br>had ever done uh a decent Siz study of<br>calcium supplements and said did you<br>collect other medical data on the<br>subjects in your study uh and many of<br>them had and um all of them were happy<br>to share that with us and so Mark Boland<br>and our group um put together a series<br>of metaanalyses and this is really the<br>the last of these met analyses where we<br>had um almost 30,000 people involved in<br>this group of studies and the way the<br>start is presented the vertical solid<br>line as the line of no effect the size<br>of the square indicates the size of the<br>study um and the horizontal line<br>represents the confidence intervals and<br>so you can see all the major studies um<br>actually suggested there was an increase<br>in the risk of heart attacks though none<br>of them well perhaps with the exception<br>of this well Woman's Health Initiative<br>study were actually statistically<br>significant but when you lump them all<br>together there was a 24% increase in the<br>risk of heart attacks which was<br>statistically significant and actually<br>that effect appeared uh really quite<br>early on so really from perhaps after<br>the first year or so of being on calcium<br>there appeared to be an increase in the<br>risk of having heart<br>attacks um more recently then we've gone<br>on to try and find um what the<br>mechanisms for this might be the<br>simplest explanation of course is that<br>we know that sick arteries have calcium<br>in their walls and if you just feed lots<br>of calcium to people some of it will<br>deposited in the arterial walls and<br>we've actually got a PhD student working<br>on that hypothesis at the moment and<br>there is evidence from other research is<br>that that does indeed happen but that<br>that doesn't rule out other<br>possibilities and so Sarah Bristo who<br>was my PhD student and over the last<br>couple of years um started looking at<br>what happens biochemically when you take<br>a calcium supplement and so this is the<br>change in blood calcium levels um in the<br>eight hours after normal women take a<br>simple 1 gr calcium supplement two<br>different sorts of supplements here but<br>your blood calcium level goes up quite a<br>long way um often above the upper end of<br>the normal range whereas people who take<br>a Placebo meal don't have any<br>significant change in their calcium over<br>that time does that matter well it just<br>might and so one of the other parameters<br>SAR looked at was blood pressure and so<br>we see the placebo group here whose<br>blood pressure actually fell during the<br>day it went up and down a bit according<br>to where they'd had meals or whatever<br>but actually it fell rather less than<br>the people who were given a calcium<br>supplement at time zero and uh for much<br>of the period of the day after they<br>taken their calcium supplement the<br>difference in in um blood pressure is<br>about 10 mm of Mercury which is quite a<br>big difference um in blood pressure and<br>that's the sort of decrease in blood<br>pressure that your doctor might hope to<br>get when he or she starts you on a blood<br>pressure medication so um we have now<br>reproduced that in the second study and<br>those sorts of changes in blood pressure<br>certainly could account for changes in<br>heart attack risk um Sarah also looked<br>at the coagulability of blood because<br>one of the key uh functions of calcium<br>is to facilitate the coagulation of<br>blood and she calculated a complicated<br>index called the coagulation index which<br>actually goes up significantly um in<br>patients in individuals normal<br>individuals who take a calcium<br>supplement so your blood is more more<br>clotting uh after you've taken a calcium<br>supplement again that can contribute to<br>you having a heart attack has this had<br>effect well this is what's happened to<br>calcium supplement use in New Zealand<br>steadily building throughout the first<br>decade of this Millennium this is our<br>first bmj paper where it leveled off and<br>then this is our subsequent metanalysis<br>in the bmj and use in this country<br>has been in free fall since that time<br>the effects overseas have been slightly<br>less dramatic because they're more<br>skeptical overseas but we've taken a<br>billion dollars a year off the world<br>consumption of calcium supplements and<br>so that's quite a significant<br>environmental impact we think more<br>importantly it's led to a re-evaluation<br>of the role of calcium intake which has<br>probably been hugely overemphasized in<br>the past and it's led to a international<br>consensus that we should be looking to<br>our diets to get calcium as well as<br>probably most of the other nutrients we<br>use need rather than taking supplements<br>and if we really want to prevent<br>fractures then we should be looking for<br>other means which fortunately are<br>time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
