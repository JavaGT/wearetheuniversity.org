quantitative models for<br>Supply Chain management because that's<br>what I do so what I want to do is<br>actually spend this time to tell you a<br>little bit about my field because I<br>suspect it's one that many people don't<br>actually know much about<br>so that's me I am the director of the<br>center for Supply Chain management and<br>yes we do have a center for Supply Chain<br>management here at the University of<br>Auckland and I'm a deputy director<br>Outreach and Industry engagement for Te<br>punaha matatini core<br>so what I want to do is just Define<br>Supply Chain management and also what do<br>I mean by quantitative modeling and then<br>I'll give some examples for my own<br>research in terms of you know<br>in that field<br>so that's the supply chain that's your<br>basic supply chain<br>you've got good slowing although of<br>course we can also talk about Services<br>we have service Supply chains or value<br>chains and we have information<br>and so that's really what research in<br>this area is all about is flows of goods<br>or information how to make them more<br>efficient how to make them more<br>effective how to coordinate different<br>players that all are acting within that<br>whole supply chain<br>So within that field what I do is<br>modeling so my favorite quote there by<br>box which many of you might know all<br>models are wrong some are useful<br>so that's my goal is to actually come up<br>with useful models that inform how we<br>should actually manage our supply chain<br>so there's lots of types of models in<br>fact there could be dot dot dot at the<br>bottom here but what I do is<br>mathematical modeling<br>so the idea is we start with a real<br>world problem<br>something on operations and Supply Chain<br>management<br>and we formulate it in terms of<br>assumptions into a mathematical model<br>we then analyze that model<br>hopefully analytically but if you can't<br>numerically we get some results and<br>conclusions and that will then tell us<br>hopefully something about the real world<br>so how does my research flow into the<br>res the real world well sometimes it's<br>working directly with companies but more<br>often it's actually through the MBA<br>classroom<br>so my research and other people like me<br>lead into insights on how you should<br>actually manage your operations in your<br>supply chain which we then tell<br>practicing managers and hopefully they<br>actually listen and go out and apply<br>so as I say I want to give a few<br>examples<br>just to make this a little more concrete<br>because when I say mathematical modeling<br>what do you what what do I even mean so<br>I've got one of my equations down there<br>just so you can actually see that's what<br>it you know our mathematical model looks<br>like it's an equation and each of those<br>terms represent things and I'm not going<br>to go over them obviously and this is a<br>stochastic model because it's got a<br>normal distribution floating around in<br>there<br>but the application is really what<br>interests me and in this particular<br>example we were thinking about hospices<br>in the US so there was a lot of<br>anecdotes out there about bad behavior<br>by hospice managers based on how they<br>get reimbursed by the US government<br>through Medicare which is their seniors<br>medical reimbursement scheme so we what<br>we were able to do is we're able to show<br>mathematically that indeed the<br>incentives are there for bad behavior<br>um so it's not surprising we saw some of<br>those bad behavior and what do I mean by<br>bad behavior I mean enrolling patients<br>who weren't actually terminally ill<br>kicking patients out just before the end<br>of the year so they didn't show up on<br>the books those sort of bad behavior<br>that you wouldn't want hospices to<br>actually partake in<br>um so fine we showed that there were<br>incentives for bad behavior what are we<br>going to do about it we were also able<br>to propose a new reimbursement scheme<br>that was much more on a rolling Horizon<br>basis that actually<br>eliminated those negative incentives so<br>a lot of the work I do and a lot of the<br>work in Supply Chain management is<br>around incentives and getting those<br>those parties to actually play nice<br>together<br>as you might imagine if it's around<br>incentives and how do people work<br>together<br>then Game Theory often is another tool<br>that we use so this is an example of an<br>inventory game you can think of Coke and<br>Pepsi stocking their stocks on Walmart<br>shelves because Walmart actually tells<br>them to make the decision they don't<br>actually tell Place orders with them and<br>so we have for anyone who's done Game<br>Theory you'll see we have response<br>curves and we have an equilibrium and we<br>basically look at that competitive<br>equilibrium when if it's out of coke you<br>might actually switch to Pepsi or if<br>it's out of Pepsi you might actually<br>switch to Coke so that competitive<br>equilibrium game under the presence of<br>switching from stock outs so that's<br>another inventory model<br>and then the last Supply example I want<br>to give is a supply chain model I have a<br>Marsden Grant<br>Rawl log exports from Tauranga are they<br>a necessary consequence of New Zealand's<br>position at the ends of the world supply<br>chain<br>um so this is looking at this question<br>of all these logs are being shipped off<br>sure<br>is that a problem<br>and traditional supply chain strategy<br>Theory would say it's actually a natural<br>consequence of the fact that we're so<br>far from market so therefore the natural<br>supply chain strategy is an efficient<br>supply chain an efficient supply chain<br>is not a value is not one where you've<br>got evaluated products<br>that's obviously a very negative story<br>that I'm telling you there so what we<br>want to do and what we are doing is<br>modeling these these trade-offs<br>quantitatively<br>can we actually get a lot more Concrete<br>where are the opportunities and then<br>we're also looking at some of the stats<br>NZ data on this to say something<br>empirically<br>um so so those are some three concrete<br>examples of of my own research uh<br>broader in within supply chain these are<br>some themes that the supply chain<br>Research Center is looking at but you<br>can see they're all quite related to<br>what I've just been talking about we<br>look at collaboration and incentives<br>Games Etc we look at risk management so<br>stochastic models sustainability and<br>then just networks and infrastructure<br>how do you actually move things from<br>here to there<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
