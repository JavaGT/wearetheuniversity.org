Valley<br>in carpy um I acknowledge we stand in in<br>in your<br>areas secondly I do acknowledge uh that<br>we stand also in the<br>fari of the people of New Zealand um and<br>thank you Minister for making that<br>available I'd also like to<br>um acknowledge what's important to<br>us in this day when people blow everyone<br>up at airports when children get killed<br>in a home<br>when countries um don't want to be in<br>Europe or think that anyway it's<br>important that we recognize what is<br>hang thank you Mr<br>Woodhouse on behalf of the University of<br>Atara and the vice chanc and Council um<br>we thank you for hosting the<br>2016 winter series lectures here in the<br>house the university is honor to be able<br>to hold um this series in Parliament<br>buildings and to you personally we thank<br>you and to your<br>colleagues before we move on um to Dr<br>Robert's lecture I'd like to give you um<br>just one or two minutes introduction to<br>a few important things that are<br>happening in the School of Business at<br>the University of<br>Vago because I would assume that you're<br>all alumni or future students<br>Education I pushed the wrong butt here<br>we go this is a cross-section of the the<br>building that currently is called the<br>Commerce building which will soon be<br>called the Taro business school we are<br>that but the building is called Commerce<br>and nobody knows what that is so it'll<br>soon be called theago business school in<br>coming weeks starting sometime in August<br>and completing in October 2017<br>approximately $155 million will be spent<br>um on modernizing the building we'll<br>create a modern learning environment and<br>a home for our<br>students the building will become more<br>accessible from street level and pardon<br>me and I'll talk ladly currently you<br>have to come in at third level and then<br>go back down but there will be an entry<br>at street level and there'll be a<br>visitor from the street level right<br>through the building out through the riv<br>the The Atrium for those who know it<br>will become<br>warm<br>dry modern and inviting hub for our<br>students pardon<br>me and the upgrade in the upgrade sorry<br>the roof will become<br>watertight I've been at the University<br>nearly 27 years I think and for 25 years<br>leaked our aim is to create an<br>outstanding campus and I'm sure the<br>council and the vice Chancellor um wish<br>that all our students can partake in<br>that outstanding campus environment and<br>the building will offer warm social<br>learning spaces for our students that<br>encourage um inquiring minds and a<br>friendly culture hopefully as I said<br>construction will conclude in October<br>2017 and after having been in the<br>building for 25 years I will have<br>retired had nine months before that's<br>been<br>achieved takes a<br>while lastly and quickly um the business<br>school has created or is developing to<br>be technically correct is creating New<br>Zealand's only doctor of Business<br>Administration there was one in the<br>country previously there is none now and<br>within a few days fingers crossed qab<br>the authority that approves new programs<br>academic programs in New Zealand will<br>approve the new program it is three-year<br>degree first year is uh taught papers to<br>teach students how to actually do<br>research and then two-year thesis that<br>is structured to allow students to<br>continue to work and focus their<br>assessment and research around their<br>workplace and problems it has a special<br>focus on social social responsibility<br>and the developing of both public good<br>and economic benefit through through<br>business<br>Improvement equally exciting and<br>attached to that program is we have<br>signed an mou between um Shanghai xong<br>University in Shanghai and theago<br>business school where we will be<br>delivering that program in<br>Shanghai currently um well 10 days ago<br>it was launched by the mayor of<br>duden um Dave c um over 200 alumni were<br>at a session and a function in<br>Shanghai um we're quite excited about it<br>Shanghai Xiao Tong University is one of<br>the three or four top universities in<br>Shanghai and they already have<br>associations with other universities<br>that you would recognize Oxford<br>Cambridge California Berkeley and<br>Toronto and we're adding<br>otago<br>yes this collaboration will help achieve<br>our desire to export New Zealand's high<br>quality education to<br>China I'd now like to turn and introduce<br>or turn to and introduce Minister<br>Michael Woodhouse and thank you Michael<br>again um who will introduce tonight's<br>you<br>George welcome to your place welcome<br>back to those of you who have been<br>participating in the 2016 University of<br>otago winter lecture series I think this<br>is lecture three uh and it's a great<br>pleasure to firstly acknowledge<br>Professor George benwell as most of you<br>know I'm very proudly denan born and<br>raised blue and gold in the veins and<br>alumnus of the University of atago but I<br>can also add the fact that everything<br>I've forgotten about information science<br>I learned from George um it was a long<br>time ago actually when I started my<br>degree the um I guess it was the faculty<br>of Commerce in those days was in the U<br>adjacent to the old library on Albany<br>Street which is now the information<br>Services building so that's where I<br>commenced my degree and<br>I uh completed my degree shortly after<br>the completion of this fantastic<br>building fantastic but flawed uh in in<br>its design and construction uh and I<br>must say I'm very<br>grateful that the University is doing<br>some of this work uh in my capacity as<br>minister of workplace relations and<br>safety there have been some issues and<br>uh they are obviously going to be<br>remedied but I do think George would<br>chuckle uh at the Revelation that uh one<br>of the<br>least High performing students he had in<br>1991 is now the Minister responsible for<br>the single largest IT project embarked<br>on in this country's public sector<br>history uh in the uh Inland Revenue<br>business transformation project it's a<br>billion and a half dollars and I'm I<br>just but actually the many learnings I<br>had uh in my Commerce degree at the<br>University of otago is used every single<br>day including speaking the language of<br>technology which is so important and so<br>ubiquitous in a modern environment<br>certainly in the public<br>sector but to tonight we're here to uh<br>listen to the presentation from Dr Helen<br>Roberts Dr Roberts is part of the otago<br>Business Schools Department of<br>accountancy and finance where she is the<br>senior lecturer for Commerce students<br>studying in their second third and<br>fourth years her research examines the<br>relationship between CEO compensation<br>firm performance and corporate<br>governance since completing her doctoral<br>study through which she focused her<br>research towards publicly listed New<br>Zealand firms Dr Roberts has extended<br>her research to areas such as board<br>structure and the relationship between<br>ownership asymmetric information and<br>corporate governance as part of a<br>longitudinal study carried out we've<br>heard that term in the winter Series<br>this year haven't we which looked at the<br>period between 1997 and 2013 her<br>research has compiled a wealth of data<br>gleaned from annual reports and from New<br>Zealand's statistics to present a broad<br>picture of trends for the cash and<br>Equity over time this evening Dr Roberts<br>will present her lecture power rigging<br>and the New Zealand CEO during which she<br>will examine the growing gap between the<br>pay of CEO and workers and the influence<br>that CEOs exert on the pay setting<br>process in New Zealand ladies and<br>Roberts good even evening and thank you<br>so much for coming out to uh listen to<br>my lecture tonight thank you George and<br>thank you Michael for your wonderful<br>introduction and I will now get my<br>pointer there we go so as uh Michael has<br>mentioned power rigging and New Zealand<br>CEO so I have been developing a wealth<br>of information in a a very well-managed<br>database that has been tracking what's<br>been happening to executive compensation<br>in New Zealand since 199 27 and I'm<br>going to share some of the information<br>that I found from that research this<br>evening so just a little guide as to<br>what you can expect tonight so I'm going<br>to give you an introduction why it is<br>I'm doing what I'm doing and why I find<br>it interesting tell you a little bit<br>about SE compensation in New Zealand<br>it's uh similar in some ways to other<br>westernized countries and different in<br>others and then I'm going to just give<br>you a little bit of a hint as to why I<br>think this is an important topic to be<br>considering when we look at the Gap and<br>the growing gap between what CEOs are<br>being paid in New Zealand and what an<br>average income is like for an employee<br>of these<br>companies I'll then talk about power how<br>the co has the ability to influence<br>paying process and rigging that could<br>potentially happen within that process<br>uh I have developed some hypothesis as a<br>little bit of a scientific methodology<br>built into this presentation and I'll<br>give you some results and some<br>conclusions from what I've been looking<br>at so for those of you who maybe aren't<br>as familiar as others with changes in<br>the companies's act in<br>1997 there was a change to the<br>companies's ACT which required that for<br>the first time ever a publicly listed<br>company in New Zealand was required to<br>disclose what their executive<br>compensation was in each of their annual<br>reports all right so what this meant<br>under the new listing requirement was<br>that if your firm was publicly trading<br>on the New Zealand stock St exchange and<br>you had employees who were being paid<br>more than $100,000 per year then you<br>needed to disclose how many employees<br>were being paid in Access of $100,000<br>within $10,000<br>bandwidths and in addition to that you<br>had to start disclosing what each of<br>your directors was being paid so if you<br>had executive directors on your board<br>who were being paid in exess of 100,000<br>then the exact amount that they were<br>being paid would be disclosed in that<br>information<br>all right so prior to 1997 when we read<br>those annual reports we had no idea<br>about what compensation levels were<br>like so what this disclosure meant was<br>now anyone using that information would<br>have a better understanding about pay<br>levels for that particular company you<br>also could find out if the SE was a<br>director and of course if the SE is a<br>director then we know exactly how much<br>that individual is being<br>paid um and that had important value for<br>both shareholders and for other<br>stakeholders as<br>well it's allowed me as a researcher to<br>look at what's happened to the level of<br>coop pay over time and it's also allowed<br>me to investigate relationships between<br>what these individuals are being paid in<br>terms of their level what impact<br>performance is having on that level of<br>pay and also to look at differences in<br>Pay based on the influence that the CEO<br>might have in that pay setting<br>process all right all right so it's a<br>very interesting area that um I've been<br>studying so what I want to do is to walk<br>you through several annual reports just<br>for you to get a sense of what it's like<br>to actually read these and understand<br>on so I'm just going to open up this<br>link this is going to take us into the<br>main page of Z Energy Z energy is a<br>recent new listing on the New Zealand<br>Stock Exchange and and we're going to<br>open up the N report and just have a<br>look at what the disclosures for CEO<br>like all right so it's just going to<br>open up it's a PDF file you can see<br>up now the hard thing when you're doing<br>this is you never know when you start<br>what you're actually going to find and<br>what you're you're you're looking for so<br>I'm just going to do a search initially<br>for the CEO's name just to see what I<br>can find because the the hard thing<br>about these documents is they can be<br>between 80 and 100 pages long so if<br>you're trying to glean just certain<br>amounts of information from them you can<br>spend quite a lot of time just going<br>through them trying to determine where<br>it is that the disclosure for executive<br>located<br>all right so if we start to look you can<br>see there's a nice picture of all of the<br>management<br>searching all right so there is a<br>description of uh the CEO it tells you a<br>little bit about his history what he did<br>before he joined the company and his<br>company uh so if we go a little bit<br>further you can you can see there's<br>information about other directors in the<br>company and uh there's a disclosure<br>there about Mr Bennett's compensation<br>you can see that he has a base salary of<br>$725,000 and this is in<br>2015 he started working for the company<br>in April of<br>2010 now what's really interesting is<br>when you start to read read the fine<br>print so if I just scroll down to this<br>next bullet point you'll see that it<br>talks about addition which remember is<br>$725,000 a year he also has an annual<br>STI now STI is an acon that means short<br>term<br>incentive all right and that is a<br>payment with an On Target value of 50%<br>of his base salary and a maximum payment<br>of up to 150% of his base salary so what<br>that means is in any given year in<br>addition to getting $725,000 in cash he<br>could get another one and a half times<br>that amount as a short-term incentive<br>provided he meets the requirements that<br>are determined by the board as to what<br>qualifies him for that<br>payment all right and then there's a<br>little bit of talk about how the board<br>has discretion about how that payment<br>will be assessed and these payments are<br>normally made exp poost so that means at<br>the end of the financial year the board<br>will sit down and look at the key<br>performance measures that it has decided<br>to assess performance on for the CEO and<br>the award is made in the first quarter<br>of the following Financial year so<br>there's a lag between when the award is<br>um being applied to what time period<br>it's being applied to what Financial<br>year and the financial year that the co<br>actually receives the<br>money all right now in addition to that<br>again there's another bullet point and<br>it tells you that the CEO is also<br>entitled to LTI payments that means<br>longterm incentive payments all right<br>and they also calculated against his<br>base salary all right so the the the<br>theme that you will find as you start to<br>read these is you'll find that the<br>larger the base salary the more the STI<br>payout will be because it will be a<br>proportion of base salary and the more<br>the LTI payment could also be because<br>again it will be based on that initial<br>base<br>salary all right and if you read down<br>you'll see that the LTI payment to which<br>Mr Bennett May entitled to in 20 15<br>could total as much as<br>$11.92 million all right so that's on<br>top of everything else I've already<br>referred<br>to all right now Zid has in addition to<br>that given Mr Bennett's an entitlement<br>to undertake what's called an RS ltip<br>which is a restricted share longterm<br>incentive plan so basically they are<br>going to allow him to be awarded some<br>shares free of charge<br>which provided he manages the company<br>well will also increase in value over<br>time and at some point in the future if<br>he so chooses he will be able to sell<br>those and convert them into cash right<br>and remember there's no capital gains<br>tax in New Zealand<br>so all right and and the value of those<br>Awards there are two of them one is in<br>2016 for<br>$428,500<br>and then there's one in<br>2017 for $48 $<br>5,747 all right that's on top of<br>2015 uh Now Zed has also agreed to pay<br>Mr Bennett's reasonable accommodation<br>and living expenses in Wellington all<br>right this is a man who earns $725,000 a<br>year and reasonable travel expenses for<br>National<br>travel particularly between Welling and<br>Oakland but not restricted to those two<br>locations all right so you can see that<br>already it's a very complex process all<br>right determining how these people will<br>be paid and then trying to actually<br>value all of that information on an<br>annual basis and track what happens to<br>time so what I've got on the rest of the<br>slide is just summarizing that<br>information that I've walked you through<br>so you can just have a a look at it and<br>again all right so that's one company<br>and there are many companies that follow<br>similar types of behavior in New Zealand<br>is another one so Chris luxon who was<br>recently appointed to the role of chief<br>executive officer at in New Zealand he<br>has a base salary in 2015 of 1.4 million<br>and that was 1.3 to5 million in 2014 so<br>he's already had a bit of a jump in his<br>base he has again a short-term incentive<br>scheme also which ranges from 55 to 110%<br>of whatever his base salary<br>is and in 2015 that equated to $1.54<br>million and that again is in<br>cash long-term incentives again are<br>going to be offered now in this case the<br>individual is receiving rights there are<br>different forms of equity incentives<br>that boards will use a right is really a<br>contract that says at some point in the<br>future you can convert this amount of<br>money into shares and then you'll be<br>able to sell them and get cash for them<br>all right so uh you can think of the<br>value as essentially being a cash value<br>that he is purchasing now but will be<br>worth more in the<br>future and he also has his own Equity uh<br>interest he owns shares in the company<br>himself and he's required to do that as<br>part of his contract and he has to<br>eventually hold 55% of his base salary<br>and Equity at at the moment he had<br>37% and in addition to that he is also a<br>member of a kiwi saver program with e<br>New Zealand which is called corus save<br>and the company very kindly contributed<br>$4,280 all right so I won't bore you<br>with all the details of every case um<br>this is a particularly interesting one<br>because if you go and search for Adrien<br>littlewood<br>in the Oakland International Airport<br>annual report you'll find very little<br>information about him at all because he<br>is only a CEO he is not on his board all<br>right he's not a director so that means<br>the disclosure requirements under the<br>companies's act from<br>1997 show that he only has to disclose<br>within a $10,000 bandwith if he earned<br>money in that range so it's very hard to<br>discern exactly what his total pay is<br>and you can see that I have shown the<br>total cash and Equity is based on the<br>highest bandwidth which for current<br>employees in 2015 was between 2.25 and<br>$22.26<br>million all right he also participates<br>in an equity program called The Phantom<br>option plan which again is just sort of<br>a fancy name for a way to own shares in<br>the future which at some point he will<br>be able to<br>sell and because of the value of these<br>or the potential value of these the<br>board has actually decided to cap how<br>much financial gain he can experience<br>from these at two and a half times his<br>award in 2012 and double the award in<br>2013 and<br>2014 right so again significant amounts<br>of money are being paid to these<br>individuals all right last one we going<br>to look at is spark spark because it's a<br>fairly new player in the exchange<br>following the separation of course and<br>Spark from<br>Telecom uh so Simon m is the CE CEO and<br>managing director so he's a director so<br>it's much easier to assess exactly what<br>he's being paid each year so he's on a<br>base of just over 1.4<br>million he will receive an incentive for<br>2015 or he did receive<br>1.32 $5 million and he has earned an<br>incentive in 2015 which will be paid in<br>2016 there's that delay of $825,000<br>I he also has redeemable shares which<br>were awarded to him all right so again<br>he's got $96,000 equity in the<br>company and he has $1,000 sorry $1<br>million in performance rights which<br>again is another Equity component he has<br>to wait for them to become eligible to<br>actually convert into shares and then if<br>he chooses he can sell those so the idea<br>of these Equity incentives is to help<br>these CEOs have flesh in the game all<br>right so they are essentially<br>shareholders and by doing that the board<br>hopes that the decisions these<br>individuals are making are in the best<br>interests of the<br>shareholder all right his take-home cash<br>million and uh he was also awarded an<br>equity value in 2015 which was<br>equivalent to<br>1.96 million which is the combination of<br>the $1 million in the performance rights<br>and the9 $16,000 worth of<br>shares so you can see it's a very<br>detailed process and it's one that<br>involves a large amount of money and it<br>spans several time periods it's not<br>easily identifiable and easy to<br>calculate you almost need to have a<br>specialized degree in calculating the<br>value of equity incentives to be able to<br>even come up with a number that might be<br>a fair estimate of the value that these<br>individuals are being paid in any<br>particular Financial<br>year so what's actually happened to the<br>value of CEO compensation over time so I<br>have now 17 years of<br>data and this graph is showing you from<br>1997 to<br>2013 on the<br>xaxis and on the y axis I've got<br>proportion measures 10 20 up to<br>100% where the different colors capture<br>the proportion of firms in that given<br>year where the CEO was paid and this is<br>just cash all right it's not including<br>the value of shares or rights or options<br>where the CEO cash that was paid in<br>total for that year as annual<br>remuneration was at most 200,000 all<br>right so about 26 27% of all CEOs in<br>1997 had a maximum of $200,000 cash in<br>their pay<br>package and 2013 it was about<br>8% right if we look at the top end so<br>now we're looking at CEOs who earned<br>more than quar of a million dollars in<br>cash in any given Financial year and you<br>can see there was about 6% who fell into<br>that category in<br>1997 in<br>28% all right so what we've seen is<br>there has been a gradual shift to<br>overall higher levels of pay with more<br>CEOs at the end of<br>2013 earning pay packages that had a<br>cash component in exess of a half<br>million all right so overall these<br>individuals are being paid more and<br>significantly<br>more now what about wealth because<br>wealth is a slightly different measure<br>and Boards include equity in the pay<br>packages of these individuals as I<br>mentioned before to try and give them<br>some flesh in the game to try and<br>motivate them to think about what what's<br>going to happen to the value of the<br>company and how that's going to impact<br>the value of my equity in this company<br>through the decisions that they make<br>because they could be self-interested in<br>only doing what benefits what benefits<br>them the most in which case the<br>shareholder is at risk of losing their<br>own investment in the company so wealth<br>looks at the value of what they paid in<br>cash plus the value of any new Equity<br>that they are awarded plus the change in<br>the value of any Equity that they were<br>awarded in a previous pay period all<br>right so why they're holding rights or<br>options or restricted share grants until<br>they're allowed to exercise and convert<br>those into shares which they can<br>sell those Securities can change in<br>value over time they're affected by<br>levels of interest rates the risk free<br>rate the volatility of Returns on the<br>company's stock over time um how long<br>they can hold them until they expire and<br>the price of the stock in the market<br>right so they're quite risky<br>Investments and if we take the value of<br>all of the pay package into account the<br>story is the same more CEOs are now<br>earning higher levels of pay and the<br>proportions are shifting quite<br>dramatically right you can see it's<br>still less than 10% are earning in that<br>top bracket in<br>1997 but of course when we move to 2013<br>we can see that now barely 7% of all<br>CEOs earn at most $200,000 a year all<br>right so they have become wealthier over<br>time and that's in terms of both cash<br>and the true value of what they're being<br>paid so how does that compare to<br>individual employees when you think<br>about employees of these companies<br>because what's becoming very uh topical<br>now is CEO worker pay levels right if<br>you think about an average employee in<br>any one of the companies that we've<br>looked at so far right so Z energy or E<br>New Zealand or<br>Spark all right Oakland International<br>Airport what does an individual take<br>home on an annual basis compared to what<br>the CEOs are being paid all right so in<br>this graph what I'm showing you again is<br>over time over 17 years and I'm looking<br>in terms of real dollars in 1997 so this<br>is adjusted for<br>inflation the blue line is the level of<br>CEO cash the red line takes into account<br>the added value of equity incentives and<br>the green line is measuring changes in<br>wealth right so the overall impact on<br>the well-being of the CEO as a result of<br>those remuneration packages and this<br>very small purple line sitting against<br>those big tall bars in the histogram is<br>what's happening to median worker income<br>all right and that's based on<br>information from New Zealand statistics<br>because these companies don't<br>disclose uh details about their<br>individual employee income but you can<br>see that it's very very small in<br>relation and if we actually do some<br>numbers uh you will see that in<br>fact The Rao the difference or the the<br>ratio of CEO pay to mean or median<br>worker income it doesn't really matter<br>which one you take is between 11 and in<br>this case 17 to 15 times but that's only<br>based on cash if I was instead to look<br>at the level of wealth change you'd find<br>that that's close to about 22 times<br>right so these individuals in 2013 were<br>earning about 22 times what the median<br>income for an employee in their company<br>was earning based on New Zealand<br>statistics<br>information so there's a growing Gap and<br>based on the levels that we're seeing<br>reported in the most recent annual<br>reports which uh up to<br>2015 the TR the trend is continuing all<br>right these people are continuing to<br>earn high based salary and then<br>significant short-term and long-term<br>incentives both in terms of cash and<br>Equity now Co pay limits aren't just a<br>concern or should not just be concern<br>for us here in New Zealand there are<br>also questions being raised about the<br>level of pay to these individuals in<br>other countries around the world as well<br>so in the United States in fact uh since<br>2010 so following uh the financial<br>crisis and the interven<br>that was brought in through the Obama<br>Administration through the saan Oxley<br>act which um sought to highly<br>disincentivize fraud and make<br>accountable Executives who chose to<br>misrepresent information in their<br>financial<br>statements uh in addition to that there<br>was a new law imposed called the do<br>Frank law it was named by the two uh<br>individuals who brought it through the<br>legal process and it requires public<br>company disclosure of CEO pay ratio<br>in the annual report and as yet no<br>publicly listed firm in the US has<br>complied with that requirement right<br>these firms are challenging the need to<br>report that information they're saying<br>it's too hard to know what a median<br>worker income is and it would not add<br>any additional value to the information<br>that's already been disclosed to the<br>shareholder so essentially they don't<br>want readers of the annual reports to<br>know what those ratios are like because<br>if you look at something like Disney<br>Corporation<br>those ratios can be as high as 2,000<br>times because these individuals are<br>being paid such high levels at such high<br>levels Switzerland as well there's been<br>concern about coo pay and actually in<br>2013 there was a national referendum it<br>had a participation rate of<br>65% where they asked individuals to vote<br>on putting a cap on the pay level of<br>CEOs at 12 time that of Junior employees<br>now the referendum wasn't<br>passed um but it was a very close there<br>was enough NOS 53% said no much to the<br>relief of many of the the large<br>companies there are 20 of the largest<br>highest paid CEOs in Europe are located<br>in Switzerland so it would have had a<br>significant impact on compensation to<br>those<br>individuals and uh Switzerland's also<br>the home to uh UBS which is a very well<br>known uh Investment Bank and after the<br>financial crisis UBS had to be bailed<br>out and following that bailout a CEO<br>tried to exit with a $78 million cash<br>golden parachute so even with laws in<br>place to try and disincentivize this<br>kind of behavior it's still perpetuates<br>itself and finally Israel Israel's<br>parliament 2016 this is in March of this<br>year has just passed legislation that<br>will cap uh coo pay levels in the<br>finance industry at 35 times the gross<br>income of the CEO's lowest paid employee<br>all right and any access if the company<br>chooses to not abide by that ruling any<br>access will not be eligible as a legal<br>expense for tax purposes so the company<br>will not be able to use exess<br>compensation payments for um avoiding<br>tax all right and then believe it or not<br>there are actually companies in the<br>world that are starting to take action<br>on these access pay levels so Dam price<br>from Gravity payments<br>uh he has decided to drop his $1 million<br>pay package down to<br>$70,000 per year and the reason he's<br>doing that is because he wants to make<br>his pay level Equitable with that of his<br>employees so there is a small video link<br>there and I'm I'm just going to<br>summarize what the content is for you so<br>essentially in 2015 he got all his<br>employees in a room and he said my pay<br>level is extremely high relative to what<br>some of your take-home pay packages are<br>I earn 22 times the lowest paid employee<br>in my organization his company processes<br>credit card payments for small to<br>mediumsized businesses so he's not a<br>very large business but he has been<br>successful so he chose to to take a pay<br>cut he's dropped his annual income to<br>$70,000 and from the day he made the<br>announcement every employee in his<br>company uh entered into a a pay package<br>which guaranteed guaranteed them at<br>least $50,000 a year and his goal is by<br>2018 everyone in his company will earn<br>at least $770,000 a<br>year so there are cosos that do have a<br>conscience out<br>there all right so that now brings me to<br>co power and rigging in a New Zealand<br>context So based on this background and<br>the information that I have been able to<br>um glean and process and think about<br>from annual reports for New Zealand<br>Executives I asked the question can CEOs<br>with more influence over the pay setting<br>process induce boards to shift the<br>waiting to better performance measures<br>and rig their incent of pay all right so<br>the way the pay setting process works is<br>the board will meet usually with a<br>compensation consultant and based on<br>advice from that consultant together<br>with negotiations with the CEO they will<br>come up with a compensation<br>package and built into that compensation<br>package there will be understandings<br>about how performance will be evaluated<br>at the end of the financial year none of<br>those details are ever disclosed in the<br>annual report although there is<br>reference made to them so there is no<br>Exane accountability as to whether the<br>payments that are awarded and assessed<br>at the end of the financial<br>year can be assessed by an external<br>party such as myself or a shareholder or<br>any other<br>stakeholder all right it also allows for<br>a board to make or change decisions<br>around awards of incentive payments and<br>it allows the CEO to influence decisions<br>about incentive payments because it's<br>all private information but the CEO is<br>the individual has the most information<br>of anyone in the company about how the<br>company is performing how well it's<br>likely to perform in the next 12 months<br>and what performance measures are going<br>to look best when it comes to evaluating<br>that<br>performance the other interesting thing<br>about New Zealand is New Zealand has a<br>diversified CEO board membership<br>population in the US and most<br>westernized countries every CEO will<br>also be a director in New Zealand that's<br>not the case the splits about 6040 60%<br>of cosos will also be directors but 40%<br>will choose not to be on the board so<br>those 40% we know a lot less about how<br>much they're being paid and how they<br>being paid all right because the<br>disclosure requirement simply States you<br>must say how many employees earn a<br>certain amount of money between a<br>$10,000<br>bandwidth all right we also know that<br>boards will use a variety of measures to<br>gauge how CEOs are performing all right<br>it's not just one measure it's not just<br>return on assets it's not just return on<br>Equity it's not just earnings before<br>depreciation amortization it's not<br>earnings per share it can be a whole<br>range of<br>measures and as I just mentioned cosos<br>are often able to discern how well<br>they're doing and which performance<br>measures are going to make them look<br>better<br>well before anybody else has any<br>knowledge and for that reason cosos may<br>be able to influence the board either<br>directly or ask via executive directors<br>who sit on the board if the COO does not<br>because the CEO helps to set the pay<br>level of the executive director Team all<br>right so there's some cronyism going on<br>here if you help me I can also help you<br>all right so there is certainly a<br>conflict of interest although it's not<br>widely<br>acknowledged and going to give you a<br>little bit of economic theory so agency<br>theory so agency theory deals with the<br>separation between owners of companies<br>and managers of companies all right so<br>if you think about a shareholder so if I<br>own shares in Telecom or Spark all right<br>so I am essentially an owner of that<br>company although I'm probably a very<br>small owner relative to the total number<br>of shares on issue so I put my trust my<br>faith on a day-to-day basis in the board<br>to design a package that will motivate<br>that CEO that managing director to act<br>in my best interest right so to maximize<br>the value of my investment over time to<br>manage risk well to make decisions about<br>good Investments which the ongoing value<br>of the firm will reflect in over time<br>and I'll see high share price and good<br>dividend<br>payouts the CEO on the other hand has a<br>slightly different view of the world all<br>right CEO wants to achieve shareholder<br>expectations hopefully but without<br>compromising ing individual utility all<br>highly um at risk in terms of holding<br>large amounts of equity in a single<br>company right so they don't have a<br>diversified portfolio both in terms of<br>human capital and financial Capital<br>because as you've seen they have<br>significant Equity stake and of course<br>um their reputation really relies on the<br>performance of the company during the<br>time that they are in their<br>position so what does the board do the<br>board is responsible for Designing<br>governance structures and incentives<br>that will try and help align the<br>interests of the CEO to those of the<br>shareholder all right that's what the<br>board's ideal responsibility should be<br>together with being an eye on day-to-day<br>performance on in terms of what the CEO<br>is actually doing as an individual<br>shareholder I receive news when it's<br>released in the media when the annual<br>and interim reports are announced and<br>any other news releases that the company<br>chooses to make public otherwise I have<br>no knowledge of what is happening on a<br>day-to-day<br>basis so I have three hypotheses that I<br>want to look at the first one is co is<br>not related to co power so a CO who has<br>more influence is no more able to<br>influence the amount that they are paid<br>than a CEO who has very little influence<br>because the pay should be set in an arms<br>length negotiating process I should have<br>no influence over how the co pays to M<br>the second one powerful cosos cannot rag<br>their pay so in other words they cannot<br>manipulate the performance measure to<br>have a higher overall pay level than<br>they would otherwise have had if the<br>performance measure had been set ex Ane<br>and was applied expost based on the<br>original contract all right so then I<br>able to influence the pay measures in<br>terms of how performance awards are made<br>and finally rigging is weaker among<br>firms with strong governance or large<br>institutional ownership if you read some<br>of the executive compensation literature<br>you will see that governance is a big<br>factor in terms of determining how well<br>the pay system works in reality and<br>together with that individual<br>shareholders Little M and Dad<br>shareholders have very little impact in<br>terms of standing up at the annual<br>general meeting and saying I disagree<br>institutional shareholders on the other<br>hand that have a significant<br>shareholding in a company if they voice<br>a concern or are willing to monitor<br>what's going on in The Firm they can<br>have an impact on what's happening on a<br>day-to-day basis all right so there are<br>some ways of trying to Monitor and<br>control what's happening but usually<br>it's at an Institutional level rather<br>than an individual shareholder<br>level so I have data right I have<br>compensation data I have information<br>about whether the co is on the board and<br>what I do is I use this data to come up<br>with different measures of CEO power<br>because there's no one defined measure<br>of how to measure the power that the CEO<br>can influence over pay setting so I use<br>sorry I use uh measures of whether the<br>co sits on the board and there's<br>evidence in the literature suggest that<br>coo board members are more influential<br>than those that are not if the co is<br>also chairman of the board which up<br>until quite recently was quite common in<br>Zealand but under the best practice code<br>that's now strongly<br>discouraged if there are executive<br>directors right so if you've got<br>managers who are also directors they can<br>influence the rest of the board and they<br>can also bring your best interest to the<br>board and influence the way pay is<br>structured the size of the board larger<br>boards uh psychology literature will<br>tell us that if you've got eight members<br>on a board it's less likely that one<br>director is going to stand up and say I<br>don't agree<br>because that's going against the<br>majority and that director wants to<br>maintain that directorship and other<br>potential directorships in the future so<br>if you become a noisy director you're<br>going to lose opportunities to be<br>director a director on other boards very<br>quickly uh as the SE on the compensation<br>committee you might think my goodness<br>that could never happen it happens and<br>it still happens in New Zealand Baro<br>Healthcare up until recently Alan Clark<br>sat on every compensation committee<br>meeting before he left AO Healthcare<br>even though it's strongly discouraged<br>now and there are some cosos who are def<br>facto members of compensation committees<br>which means they're not true members but<br>they still attend the<br>meetings all right and finally our board<br>appointments during ten years so while<br>you're a CEO if you appoint someone to<br>the board chances are they're going to<br>look on you more favorably than if they<br>were appointed under another CEO all<br>right there's some evidence in the<br>literature suggests that can also be<br>a a factor in terms of measuring<br>power in addition to those power<br>measures I control for things like<br>Equity components in the pay package The<br>Firm performance so I have a measure for<br>shortterm which is return on assets<br>which is simply the earnings before<br>interest and tax divided by the total<br>assets measured in the book value of the<br>balance sheet all right so what's<br>happened in the last 12 months<br>essentially and stock market return<br>which is more of a long-term<br>measure um I control firm size a control<br>for Equity ownership how long the co has<br>been there how volatile the share return<br>is and also the governance strength and<br>the institutional<br>ownership so a little bit of little bit<br>of maths not too much all right so I'm<br>just going to walk you through I'm going<br>to tell you what's important here and<br>then we'll look at some results so this<br>is an equation and what it's saying is<br>the compensation of firm I in<br>yet is this is like an intercept term<br>you think of a straight line and what I<br>do is I allow each firm to have a<br>different intercept term because firms<br>can vary all right so it allows A<br>variation in the level of firm pay over<br>time and then I have a coefficient times<br>that power measure all right so I talked<br>about different ways cosos can exert<br>power and I actually have five different<br>ways of measuring power and I test each<br>of those and see if I get consistent<br>results and then I have uh these<br>standardized standardized measures of<br>short and long-term performance because<br>I what I want to do is be able to<br>compare sensitivity to Performance<br>across all the companies and you can<br>imagine some companies are really big<br>they have really high roas some<br>companies are very small and they have<br>very low roas or very poor long-term<br>performance measures at the moment<br>because they're just starting up so what<br>I do is I standardize all those<br>performance measures so they're all<br>measured relative to a mean of zero and<br>a standard deviation of one because what<br>I'm really interested in asking is does<br>this power parameter have an impact on<br>compensation and if these return<br>measures are jumping around all over the<br>place I'm not going to be able to<br>isolate the effect of power so I have<br>these standardized measures of<br>performance and then I have controls for<br>like size and volatility and how long<br>the co has been there and what the<br>equity component of the pay is and I<br>also have a variable here that controls<br>for each year of my sample because<br>strange things can happen in some years<br>and it could just be we're observing a<br>financial crisis that year so that's<br>driven the result right so I want to try<br>and avoid those random effects that<br>might bring me spirous<br>results all right so that's my first<br>relationship does power influence c p<br>and the second one is saying in addition<br>to more power leading to higher pay can<br>the CEO rig their pay so in other words<br>if they're more powerful are they able<br>to influence by choosing the maximum<br>performance measure to impact how much<br>they paid all right so if you're<br>powerful this power measure is going to<br>have a value other than zero if you're<br>not powerful the power measure will have<br>either a low value or a value of zero so<br>the more powerful you are what influence<br>does choosing between the higher of the<br>two returns have on<br>pay so the take-home messages we want to<br>look at the value of alpha 1 and we want<br>to know is that positive and significant<br>from a statistical point of view and<br>then we want to look at the C efficient<br>Alpha 4 and we're asking the same thing<br>is that positive and<br>significant and then after we've done<br>that I go and I look at governance and I<br>say well if these firms are strongly<br>governed or weakly governed does that<br>affect this relationship do we see<br>rigging more when there's weak<br>governance and less when there's strong<br>governance and equally when we have<br>institutional ownership those<br>institutions should be monitoring<br>because they have the money and they<br>have the ability to monitor on a daily<br>basis what these CEOs are doing does<br>that also infu influence that<br>relationship between what these CEOs are<br>being paid and their ability to rig<br>their<br>pay all right so the measures you've<br>already seen I've got cash I've got Cash<br>Plus new Equity I've got Cash Plus new<br>equity and the change in equity I've got<br>some power measures which are based on<br>if the co is a director if the co is a<br>chairman if the co sits on their own<br>compensation committee if the board sign<br>is higher than the median board size in<br>any given year and if the number of<br>Insiders on the board is higher than the<br>median in any given year in other words<br>the higher the power measure the greater<br>influence the CEO potentially can have<br>on the pay setting<br>process so let's look at some results<br>all right so I have seven different<br>models here what I'm measuring I'm<br>measuring total compensation which is<br>Cash Plus equity all right doesn't<br>really make sense to look at wealth<br>because wealth can fluctuate based on<br>previous Equity issues so we're just<br>looking at new pay Awards both in terms<br>of cash and equity and I have some<br>different measures of pay these first<br>seven<br>variables are measures of pay so I've<br>got a power index which is looking at<br>the individual's ability to manipulate<br>pay based on their involvement in the<br>board and then I just look at some<br>individual measures of power like the<br>proportion of inside dire if the co is<br>on the committee that sets the pay level<br>the size of the board if the co is a<br>chairman and if the C is on the board<br>and then I make an index using five of<br>these<br>measures and the higher the index the<br>more power the CEO is able to exert on<br>the pay setting process and then I've<br>got some controls I've got controls for<br>performance controls for size of the<br>firm controls for volatility on Returns<br>on those<br>shares um ownership because there's some<br>lature that says there's an optimal<br>amount of equity that a COO should own<br>and after that the C will become<br>entrenched and just consume for<br>prequisite benefit right they won't<br>really care about what it does what the<br>co decision does to the company they'll<br>just keep making decisions that benefit<br>them and we control for how long the<br>CO's been there and what do we see we<br>see n 1 2 3 4 five of those power<br>measures are highly significant<br>so that's telling us that more powerful<br>CEOs in New Zealand are able to<br>influence their level of pay all right<br>so that's the first main result so now<br>we want to look at rigging we want to<br>see if we select the maximum of the<br>short and long-term performance measure<br>and if the co is also powerful is that<br>significant all right so we have the<br>individual maximum performance measure<br>yes that influences the level of pay<br>power also influences pay and we see<br>that in some of the power IND measures<br>but not all of them but for uh board<br>size for firms where the co is also a<br>chairman and in cases where the board is<br>large right the board size is larger<br>than the median we find that there is<br>evidence of rigging all right so that<br>interaction between the maximum return<br>measure and the CEO power level is<br>significant and positive so not only can<br>more powerful CEOs influence how much<br>they're paid they also have the<br>potential to rig all right so to<br>predetermine through their influence<br>over the board<br>which performance measure in any given<br>year will determine the maximum<br>payouts now we do some robustness tests<br>around those results I don't only have<br>those two results but I thought that was<br>probably enough for you to see that<br>there are significant results so the<br>last hypothesis looks at this role of<br>governance and I form an index which<br>looks at um various measures of<br>governance within the firm so a firm<br>that has a low score on the index is<br>well governed a firm that has a high<br>score on the index has weak governance<br>and when we run that same model I<br>haven't got all the controls here but we<br>look at that rigging right so maximum<br>performance measure interacted with the<br>power that the co can<br>influence both the higher the pay<br>performance measure the higher the co<br>gets paid but also the CO's power is<br>able to influence that level of pay is<br>significant for every Power index and<br>firms that have poor governance right so<br>firms where you have a COO who's sitting<br>on the board where you have a large<br>board size or you have a COO sitting on<br>a compensation committee<br>you find greater effect of<br>rigging High governance firms the only<br>time where it seems to be an issue is<br>when you've got a very large board size<br>a size a board that's got a size that's<br>median and then we do the same thing<br>again or I do the same thing again but<br>this time I'm now looking at<br>institutional ownership and are<br>institutional investors able to monitor<br>pay levels and influence whether or not<br>CEOs are able to rig so we see there's<br>the maximum performance measure there's<br>the power measure and we see that some<br>of those rigging variables are again<br>significant so consistent story we've<br>got weaker governance weaker monitoring<br>you see that there is a possibility for<br>CEOs to be able to extract higher levels<br>of<br>pay um and there's a little bit of<br>evidence um present for institutional<br>Holdings that are high as well but only<br>in one or two of<br>the um Power cases not all of them all<br>right so it tends to suggest that when<br>you've got poor governance or lower<br>institutional shareholding there's often<br>a higher incidence of CEOs both having<br>power to influence their pay and also<br>rig their pay all right so what are my<br>results telling<br>me well they suggest that on average<br>powerful cosos are able to rig their<br>pay and it seems that um the pay is more<br>sensitive to the better performance<br>measure right so we look at the max<br>between the short-term and the long-term<br>performance measure that variable is<br>usually significant suggesting that pay<br>is highly associated with better<br>performance uh rigging is associated<br>with ses that have a high power index<br>score and particularly firms with a<br>board size that's greater than the<br>sample median and CEOs who sit on their<br>own boards right so so those firms in<br>particular we find that cosos tend to<br>have a higher influence on the pay<br>setting<br>process weak governance supports rigging<br>all right so if You' got a firm where<br>you haven't got good governance in place<br>you're more likely to see evidence of<br>rigging and that last result that I just<br>pointed out to you where typically High<br>inst institutional ownership ownership<br>reduces rigging except in the case where<br>you've got very large boards and even<br>then<br>it's possible that the CEO is able to<br>rig the<br>compensation so what does this mean for<br>cop pay in New<br>Zealand well all we can say really is<br>that on average we know powerful CEOs do<br>engage in rigging can I actually point<br>my finger tonight and tell you which<br>company which CEO no I can't all right<br>it's very hard to detect when rigging is<br>going on in<br>practice and which CEO are involved all<br>right and it is even the case that some<br>cosos and Boards will want to camouflage<br>access compensation right there's<br>cronyism going on and that makes it even<br>harder for cosos to be able to identify<br>problem possible solutions Collective<br>action against rigging it's often<br>difficult High legal costs involved so<br>for individual shareholders it's very<br>hard to do and it means bringing a class<br>to action and often it's hard to replace<br>powerful cosos they will Counterattack<br>any claims um brought against them<br>concerning<br>rigging solution well policy that<br>encourages direct disclosure of EX anti-<br>incentive pay contracts would be ideal<br>all right so very much uh initial around<br>transparency so making it very clear<br>from the very beginning when the<br>contract is set beginning of the<br>financial year what performance measures<br>are going to be used in the assessment<br>and then they are reported very clearly<br>in the annual report for all of the<br>shareholders to be able to read and um<br>understand strong governance and more<br>independent boards can reduce reduce<br>contract rigging all right so making<br>sure that boards are doing what they're<br>supposed to be doing and that governance<br>structures are in place that encourage<br>the best possible practice that would be<br>most<br>acceptable all right so I'm now more<br>than happy to take questions and I thank<br>attention we have a roving microphone<br>here so Lisa we'll bring the microphone<br>to you if you want to ask a<br>question oh yeah there's one there at<br>the front<br>too thank you<br>for yeah thank you for um tackling this<br>very important topic um my feeling is<br>that there are some questions that you<br>haven't raised one is how to get the<br>best people at the top right and it<br>seems to me that a large salery isn't<br>necessarily it the second one is I<br>think rigging is only part of the<br>problem I think that the there should be<br>a<br>camp should be some kind of a cap<br>related to the lowest um salary or the<br>mean salary and this rigging is I would<br>say well well perhaps you could answer<br>what do you think What proportion of the<br>salary is affected by<br>this uh I could actually I should have<br>done that I can estimate that from the<br>models I can take the coefficients and I<br>can estimate it but I would say that it<br>could be in the order of up to half a<br>million dollars MH for some companies<br>not all companies but for some companies<br>if I take<br>uh their their medium performance<br>measure and then use that together with<br>the coefficients from the model I could<br>estimate yeah within one standard<br>deviation how much of an influence it<br>has on the overall pay level yes and<br>getting the right person I agree I mean<br>part of the argument in New Zealand is<br>that we have a small pool of talent you<br>know it's very hard to attract these<br>people and you might agree or disagree<br>and I would argue that I don't<br>necessarily agree with that either and<br>you have some fat cats you know they<br>have been around long enough now that uh<br>they have experience and they can use<br>that in the negotiating to be able to<br>get a base salary that's a lot higher<br>than you know a new startup a company<br>that's just been publicly listed that's<br>much more risky and they just don't have<br>the cash flow to support High payouts<br>and I think the other part of the story<br>which isn't addressed here but also<br>needs to be looked at is the role of<br>compensation consultants in the setting<br>of executive compensation uh because<br>because they also have a vested interest<br>in maintaining relationships with<br>companies who have boards that each year<br>need to re visit how much we pay our<br>executive team and how do we determine<br>what that amount should be and what the<br>components of that pay package should<br>look like and they base their assessment<br>on the median pay level within the<br>sector and every year if every CEO gets<br>a new higher base salary and we saw that<br>in one of my examples all right<br>the average for the sector goes up so<br>that then becomes the new Benchmark<br>which every company in that sector will<br>use to set the base salary for the CEO<br>going into the subsequent Financial year<br>so there's a ratcheting effect that goes<br>on within the whole pay setting<br>process so you're right yeah there's<br>still lots of questions to be asked good<br>points I think you<br>may you may have already asked answer<br>the question I was going to ask do you<br>think it's possible that disclosure<br>requirements have caused this increase<br>in the gap between the top executive<br>pays and the average worker pay um just<br>the M fact that there's a an arms like<br>an arms race going on at the top end<br>yeah possibly and although I think in<br>some ways the disclosure makes it easier<br>to hide because if you're a CEO and<br>you're not on your own board then the<br>disclosure is minimal really I mean it's<br>like Adrian littlewood you know it's<br>just between 2 whatever it was 2.25 2.26<br>million I don't really know other than<br>that um how much is getting paid in any<br>given<br>year and I can only discern that from<br>that list of employees and based on what<br>is in the annual report I know it can't<br>be any of the other pay levels below<br>that so I have to assume that that's his<br>pay level so uh there is an element of<br>secrecy which means that I don't know<br>what goes on behind closed doors when<br>the board makes that decision and<br>actually if you ask the director<br>honestly they would say we really don't<br>know how to set pay they rely a lot on<br>the compensation consultant and the<br>compensation consultant relies a lot on<br>the survey data that they get each year<br>from the companies who they then consult<br>with in the following<br>year so there's a lot of yeah breakdown<br>in the whole arms length negotiating<br>process mhm but I think there's just<br>some genuine accountability that needs<br>to be brought into this as well<br>MH that's my personal opinion though<br>it's a gentleman at the back and then<br>there's another one at the front<br>yeah uh yes uh could you tell me you've<br>done excellent work uh where will it go<br>this way who will take it up and make<br>use of it and another question if I ask<br>who developed these enormous bonuses the<br>idea of these uh bonuses because I've<br>worked for about 50 years I didn't get a<br>never got a<br>bonus<br>yes I know I know and you know classic<br>example you know Theresa gang before she<br>left Telecom she was taking home $50,000<br>a week you know it's just but<br>individuals don't realize this and the<br>way it's reported in the reports is it's<br>really hard work to get this information<br>out so I think there needs to be work<br>done on how the information is being<br>disclosed and maybe shareholders I don't<br>know who raises the question of are coo<br>pay levels in New Zealand too high one<br>CEO has asked that question that's Gary<br>pal who has just stepped down from the<br>warehouse but uh he has said publicly<br>I've heard him say that he felt that he<br>did so and we will this hopefully this<br>will be published and hopefully I can<br>get it into the media and we can create<br>some conversation around how these<br>people I'm not saying they're being paid<br>too much but I think it's a question<br>mhm<br>okay um this is a very very short<br>question on language why do you use the<br>word compensation which generally in<br>implies that someone suffered some<br>injury or insult oh right I think it's<br>just the academic literature it tends to<br>be either and if you read an annual<br>report it's usually if I have to search<br>I either search for CEO compensation or<br>CEO remuneration they are the two labels<br>that are used mhm but you're right it's<br>mhm<br>oh just talk it okay I was going to ask<br>about taxation but uh I also wonder<br>whether Gary Powell and Gareth Morgan<br>who both protested that they get too<br>much whether that has had any influence<br>on those um you know um equations or<br>whatever that you're<br>doing but to get back to um<br>taxation when you offload were more and<br>more onto performance pay uh does that<br>affect Taxation and also if Joe blogs<br>decides to um uh get um shares instead<br>of dividends you still pay tax what<br>happens way up the higher echelons here<br>of shares given to CEOs MH see the<br>interesting thing with Equity is when<br>they are awarded they normally have to<br>vest so until they are actually<br>available to be converted into Equity I<br>don't think that they're taxable all<br>right because the CEO has to meet<br>certain performance criteria in order<br>for them to vest so he will be or she<br>will be awarded a certain package and<br>within that package it might be 3<br>million options and 1 million of those<br>will vest each year for the next 3 years<br>and once they're vested then they're<br>actually allowed to decide do I want to<br>use this contract to buy shares in the<br>company because sometimes they expire<br>worthless they don't all um turn into<br>Equity the capital gains on the equity<br>when they sell them are zero right so<br>there's no tax on any capital gain that<br>they make but anything that's taxable in<br>terms of a an award which is<br>realized uh would be you taxed at<br>although many of these people have trust<br>so yes anything that's cash would be<br>yes okay if I understood what you said<br>and and your charts you proved that um<br>some measure of rigging is going onh<br>that's right on average yes MH fine um<br>looking forward to future<br>work have you considered how you<br>might compute the odds that an<br>individual uh company had rigged their<br>compensation and um uh you know so that<br>one could say oh well there's only a a a<br>2% chance that this one was rigged or<br>there's only<br>a 4% chance that this one wasn't rigged<br>right um that would be a a useful sort<br>of thing sure and while you're at it uh<br>you might also work<br>on um what value the CEO presumably does<br>bring M if there was a way to<br>measure that right good no there good<br>suggestions and certainly yeah I could<br>look at uh the what factors are going to<br>increase the likelihood of rigging mhm<br>yeah yeah that would be great<br>mhm um yeah it seems from your work that<br>institutional investors or um<br>shareholders could have a significant<br>effect um so I guess two questions um<br>the one is are there any legal<br>restrictions on how much an institution<br>can invest in a particular<br>company okay um and is there any<br>evidence that institutional investors<br>have moved to limit CEO payments<br>oh yeah good so in New Zealand the uh if<br>you trade more than 10% of the equity on<br>issue at any given time you have to<br>declare intention before you trade so<br>that would be the only legal it's not a<br>legal restriction but because if you<br>start to trade more than 10% it can have<br>a significant effect on the share price<br>if you buy or sell because obviously if<br>you increase demand for the share it's<br>going to push the price up you know<br>you're trading enough shares in one go<br>uh so legally there's no other<br>requirement other than the majority<br>shareholders in the company might<br>suddenly start paying attention if some<br>outside Institutional Investor buys up<br>big amounts of shares very quickly<br>because it could uh indicate takeover<br>activity and that would make the co very<br>scared right so uh labor market control<br>can have a an<br>important um monitoring effect I guess<br>because if the firm is being mismanaged<br>of the is abusing that power role to the<br>extent that the value of the company's<br>being compromised then it becomes a<br>takeover Target and that's when you know<br>you can see institutional investors<br>having um a real impact because they'll<br>come in and and they'll buy out the<br>company and then they'll replace the<br>management I guess um another point to<br>that is um institutional investors<br>should look after the money of the<br>people that are investing in them so<br>they they should have an incentive then<br>make sure the companies they invest in<br>do perform yes and that CEOs are not<br>overly rewarded right I don't see any<br>evidence that that happens yes no and<br>probably it's more typically<br>institutional investors will just walk<br>right they'll just take their money out<br>rather than go through the legal process<br>of<br>contesting yeah something that they<br>necessarily see as being poor<br>management yeah you're<br>right right good M um hi my question is<br>um like what Israel has done past um in<br>the parliament yes do you think New<br>Zealand government would do that or<br>would do your research U make uh the um<br>member of parliaments to think about<br>that and I think I mean you know Israel<br>was a small country you know they had a<br>national referendum and they have made<br>this their new a new law right so I I I<br>think it's not impossible in New Zealand<br>if Israel can do it there's no reason<br>why New Zealand couldn't I think it's<br>it's a question that should be addressed<br>and I think probably enough individuals<br>aren't aware of the pay levels of these<br>individuals mhm because to read the<br>annual reports it's very timec consuming<br>and it's very confusing you really need<br>some I mean I I don't want to say I'm an<br>expert but I'm used to reading these<br>things and I can even like I read it two<br>or three times before I actually<br>understand how the pay is even<br>structured let alone how much it's<br>actually<br>worth yeah so I think it's it's<br>something New Zealand needs to look at<br>yes hi alen Max rashbrook here thanks<br>very much for your presentation um just<br>a couple of<br>questions from your results would you<br>say that if New Zealand firms all<br>shifted themselves to the sort of Ideal<br>governance standards to what extent I<br>mean completely or partially would the<br>issues about rigging<br>disappear um and then a second question<br>on reporting in the ukv high paace Ender<br>has said that basically companies should<br>be limited to one base measure and maybe<br>one performance measure and that's it<br>particularly because it's just so very<br>difficult to understand what on Earth is<br>going on with compensation a lot of the<br>time uh what are your thoughts on that<br>or any other reporting things other than<br>what you mentioned in terms of the<br>exante<br>stuff all right so um so the first one<br>is about<br>the right the governance<br>standards so a best practice code came<br>in in 2004 and<br>great initiative but actually only two<br>of them are mandatory and one of them<br>most firms probably complied with<br>already which was the audit committee<br>requirement and you have to have now<br>someone who has a CA or an FCA you know<br>someone who actually can truly audit<br>financial statements you can't just be<br>on that committee for the sake of being<br>on a committee all right uh and the<br>other best practice code was around<br>Independence on the board so now you<br>have to at least two independent<br>directors if you have eight or more<br>directors on your board you have to have<br>at least three or a minimum of a third<br>of the board has to be deemed<br>independent and it has to be declared in<br>your annual report so I think that's<br>helped and certainly firms are<br>disclosing that in their annual<br>reports but I still think that directors<br>don't necessarily have the knowledge and<br>the training to be able to set<br>compensation especially you know the way<br>it's being set at the moment that that<br>the expertise that's needed I think they<br>are trying to do the best they can they<br>want to motivate these individuals to<br>act in the best interest of the<br>shareholder<br>and I think yeah more governance and uh<br>more uh monitoring of how how CEO<br>involvement is being carried out with<br>within the firm and within the board<br>around these decisions would be helpful<br>what that looks like I'm not so<br>sure and you know it's a free economy<br>too so you don't want to lock everything<br>up so much and having single measures<br>yeah I don't think companies would ever<br>agree to that you<br>know<br>final question okay final question<br>great um thank you very much for your<br>presentation it's um extremely<br>insightful and and um you thoroughly<br>enjoyed it um just looking to the to the<br>Future from your data and stuff like<br>that in terms of the balance and power<br>so if you're CEO and you're on a board<br>um with the recent health and safety<br>introductions and the the we'll call it<br>the Peter Jackson effect of removing<br>himself from the directorships um for<br>fear of risks and prosecutions right is<br>that potentially something that may<br>shift the the power IM balance s the the<br>the the the power issue you're you're<br>relating to moving forward um where they<br>could potentially well you know you've<br>mentioned that they they understand the<br>business and they know where it's going<br>and they want to drive it well a judge<br>might sit there and sit there and say<br>well actually you are there driving it<br>and you should know better and right<br>double at RIS so that might shift the<br>the balance yes um and the other point<br>you uh you made something about the USA<br>being a unable to disclose which got me<br>thinking having lived in North America<br>for 3 years that a lot of employees um<br>have a sort of a $10 an hour wage but<br>they get a get tips and stuff which<br>takes it up which would make it<br>difficult so M for those employees are<br>we likely to see changes in the<br>employment space where be looking to<br>more tips and and things like that um to<br>try and bring their wages up not<br>obviously not to 22% of what the see is<br>right just interested in your two<br>thoughts on the shift and power and the<br>future for employees right yeah and I<br>think my intuition tells me if I'm a CEO<br>who doesn't sit on my board uh I have<br>the ability to do a lot more than the<br>majority of the shareholders know<br>because it's just not going to be<br>disclosed in the annual report to the<br>degree to the detail uh that me as an<br>individual reader can then look at and<br>assess all right it's just very very<br>opaque what's actually going on how<br>decisions are being made what's being<br>paid when and why so so I think you<br>might see a shift off the board yeah if<br>there's more vigilance paid to how these<br>individuals are being<br>compensated um in the US it's the<br>service sector where the Tipping is<br>really critical actually right so<br>especially waiting waiting staff if they<br>don't get tips they don't basically earn<br>enough to live on um so it's an expected<br>part of that payment structure uh the<br>example I showed you the gravity payment<br>uh Dan who's Just DE to take<br>$70,000 um annual salary and make sure<br>all his other employees are at that<br>level within 3 years I think um that<br>that could be real for New Zealand you<br>know we have a lot of people in poverty<br>already and that's not going to go away<br>and I think if everyone can enjoy a<br>living wage a living income I think that<br>would be amazing and it's not impossible<br>it just means some people have to say<br>I'm not going to have as much money in<br>the future as I have in the past but<br>they've already got accumulated wealth<br>they're not really losing they're just<br>not getting as much as they used to get<br>MH<br>okay all right wind up wind up Helen<br>thank you uh you can see the lights<br>going and the bell's going which means<br>that MPS need to be going to the chamber<br>but of course we will uh hopefully all<br>of us take a leally stroll to the west<br>wing and have some refreshments can I<br>just make a couple of observations about<br>some of the questions um firstly in my<br>capacity as Minister for workplace<br>relations and safety uh I have a very<br>strong view as a former CEO and an<br>employer of many staff that compensation<br>by other than base salary for the vast<br>majority of our workers is not something<br>that new zealanders culturally accept so<br>tipping and Hospitality tends not to be<br>a widespread part of our remuneration<br>and I don't expect that to change our<br>our minimum wage is twice that of the<br>United States nearly a and uh I<br>certainly would hate to think that that<br>was um creeping in as far as the Peter<br>Jackson effect on Boards of changes not<br>only to health and safety but to other<br>expectations on governance I think that<br>was a<br>misreporting um but never the less a<br>concern what I think Helen's research<br>has shown very clearly and an extremely<br>scientific manner is that uh<br>Independence and good governance matter<br>Independence of the CEO from the<br>governors uh and the quality of<br>governance is is really important we<br>started I started this morning with my<br>colleague Lise upston the minister for<br>women uh at The Institute of directors<br>launching an expanded future directors<br>program aimed at bringing greater<br>diversity onto New Zealand's boards not<br>just in gender but ethnically<br>geographically and in age because what<br>we know is that boards that all look<br>like me aren't nearly as effective as<br>boards that look more like New Zealand<br>and I think we need to make sure that we<br>have the quality of governance<br>maintained and<br>approved um and and diversity will be<br>one way of doing that the last thing I<br>would just add um in respect of employee<br>share schemes short-term income from<br>shares and share options is that um I'm<br>also minister of Revenue uh the inland<br>revenue is currently Consulting on<br>changes to rules around the taxation of<br>employee share schemes and the primary<br>purpose of that review is to make a more<br>enabling framework because what we know<br>is that for many uh startup companies<br>particularly in the tech sector share<br>schemes for employees not just executive<br>remuneration but for you know we see it<br>in bus drivers here in Wellington we see<br>it at zero we see it at some of the it<br>startups that we've got in denan they're<br>really really important at attracting<br>and retaining not just the executives<br>but the people at the coace what it's<br>also doing though is identifying and<br>actually stamping out some of the<br>negative aspects of employee share<br>schemes that are designed to avoid tax<br>and there are share option arrangements<br>and interest free loans uh that create<br>the appearance of capital gain which in<br>shares is generally taxfree in New<br>Zealand when in fact it's actually<br>income and so that very point is being<br>considered by Inland Revenue right now<br>as an important way to improve the<br>access to employee share schemes because<br>we think they're very good vehicles but<br>also to stamp out a bit of a loophole<br>that's there as well so I hate to sort<br>of come in and give a little mini<br>lecture at the end but I thought it<br>would be helpful just to round off those<br>questions those very good questions with<br>some observations uh of my own Helen<br>thank you thank you for an incredibly<br>insightful and<br>interesting uh insight into uh an area<br>of compensation that the overwhelming<br>majority of new zealanders will never be<br>troubled by um it's almost a bit like<br>winning Lotto becoming CE of some of<br>these companies uh but very important<br>nevertheless that this research has<br>continued so on uh your behalf please<br>Roberts</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
