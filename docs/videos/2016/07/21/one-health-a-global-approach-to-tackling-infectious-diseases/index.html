Christchurch</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>gentlemen it's my pleasure to Cher the<br>series of public lectures uh this is the<br>sixth in a series of eight lectures that<br>we're doing this year it's my great<br>pleasure tonight to introduce Professor<br>David Mur<br>David like many of us was a medical<br>student through here a few years back he<br>his initial training in uh pathology<br>microbiology um and other early workers<br>resident officer in Christ Church he<br>then did further training in tropical<br>Health infectious diseases microbiology<br>at Liverpool and at Duke University in<br>uh in the United<br>States in 2002 uh David was a appointed<br>by the university to be professor and<br>head of our department of theology in<br>chch and David's done an excellent job<br>in that role over the last 14 years uh<br>tonight he's going to talk about one<br>Health a global approach to tackling<br>infectious diseases I'm sure David will<br>give you B background that I can over to<br>you thank you Peter and this is sound<br>okay you can hear<br>me well thank you for coming along<br>tonight and thanks for that introduction<br>Peter um the talk I'm going to give<br>tonight is on a topic called one Health<br>which I I expect that to know one of<br>this audience or there are a few people<br>actually will know what one Health is<br>but most of you will not know what one<br>Health is and I will uh in the talk<br>explain what one Health is which is a a<br>relatively new approach to how to tackle<br>particularly infectious diseases<br>um and then tell you a little bit about<br>what we are doing in New Zealand at the<br>moment with a one health initiative but<br>I thought I before I Define one Health I<br>would uh just tell you a small story<br>that will illustrate a lot of the<br>aspects of one Health I'll take you back<br>um about 15 years and this is Catman do<br>the uh where I've had a long Association<br>and back then um in 2001 some colleagues<br>and I were involved in a in a research<br>project that was based in one of the<br>main hospitals this is the hospital here<br>it's called hon hospital<br>um it's one of three large General<br>hospitals in in the C Valley C being the<br>capital of Nepal and the project was a<br>relatively simple one um this is a<br>country that has a heavy burden of<br>infectious diseases it's also a very<br>poor country and although um there was<br>great awareness of infectious disease is<br>the ability of the hospital staff to<br>actually diagnose those infections and<br>know what were the key infections what<br>was the burden of those infections it<br>was very limited just because of a lack<br>of resources and so the project we did<br>was was a very simple one uh it was<br>still called the Fus day that was what<br>it was called at the time people still<br>refer to it as the the fenus day which<br>actually became quite a sentiment study<br>in in Nepal and all we did was for a<br>period of time each adult admitted to<br>hospital with fever fever is one of the<br>main symptoms of infectious diseases<br>what we would do is we would gra a<br>battery of tests and these were tests<br>that wouldn't normally uh have been<br>available simple blood tests by the test<br>and we found a few things that weren't a<br>surprise uh we found a huge burden of<br>typhoid fever and cman then and probably<br>still as World capital of typhoid um so<br>we really confir that is as a major uh<br>disease pneumonia was common but one of<br>the surprises was we found U tyus to be<br>very Comm very similar name to tyho but<br>tyus and some of you may have heard of<br>typhus typhus is an it's actually a<br>group of infections caused by very small<br>bacterium called<br>rety and this one was called murine<br>typus mine refers to to<br>mice and this was something that we<br>hadn't although we tested for we thought<br>it might be there we hadn't actually<br>expected it to be so Comm and this is an<br>infection that causes fever and headache<br>and sometimes re sometimes can be very<br>severe uh and it requires particular<br>antibiotics to treat it so that was a<br>mjor finding and in fact ever since this<br>is one of the the impacts of that study<br>was that the clinicians are aware of<br>tyus and they think about it and they<br>often will treat patients um thinking<br>about tyus but to actually<br>really understand the disease and<br>perhaps get a better idea about who<br>would be a risk of tyus who was um and<br>um perhaps how to prevent it we we need<br>more information in fact some of our own<br>data showed that it was particularly<br>common winter and was particularly<br>common in certain parts of the city um<br>and we also know a few things about tius<br>um we know it's linked to and this is a<br>rat on the streets of K Mandu um we know<br>it's linked to to to rats so contact<br>with rats and in fact it's transmitted<br>from rats to humans by fleas and so<br>that's the connection and that's been<br>that was recognized for a long time and<br>so people uh are at risk of maring typus<br>when an environment exposed to to Rob of<br>course we think of those sorts of envir<br>environments and I'm sure some of you<br>here being the katundu a very typical<br>photograph of the very crowded housing<br>conditions is a very poor country uh<br>poor living conditions a place where<br>rodent infestation would be expected and<br>so in a way we hadn't thought about<br>Maring tyus so strong but this is<br>actually a very obvious place for us so<br>here we have situation of the disease<br>link to rodents and fleas and this<br>environmental aspect so there really<br>were three aspects the human s we tend<br>to focus most of our attention on but it<br>was clearly an element that was<br>important to rodents and the environment<br>and if we were to think about how we<br>might want to prevent the disease there<br>obviously other ways we might want to do<br>it other focusing on the humans maybe<br>rading control maybe improving the<br>housing things and and this is really um<br>the core of one Health the idea that you<br>really can't understand particularly<br>infectious disease properly without<br>having this global view that include<br>that looks at animals that looks at the<br>environment so in fact these are the<br>three components that from the Triad one<br>Health and this is actually the diagram<br>that you more commonly see which shows<br>the that are the humans the non-human<br>animals in the environment and there are<br>many definitions of one Health but it's<br>usually on the basis of that that the<br>health of humans animals and VI<br>viability of ecosystems are very much<br>linked and in fact they're inextricably<br>linked and here's another definition one<br>health concept one Health is dedicated<br>to improving the lives of all species<br>human and animal through the integ of<br>human medicine vetenary medicine and<br>environmental science it's really<br>getting people together the human health<br>people the animal health people the<br>environmental science people to help<br>solve some of these issues that relate<br>to human and animal health and the way<br>it's kind of obvious and you know the<br>elephant in the room um it is a really<br>obvious concept but in human health<br>we've been really really slow to take<br>the S the Vets have lived way they<br>really pushed this they understand they<br>talk to any vet they know what one<br>Health is talk to most doctors they<br>don't know what one Health is and in a<br>way it is a very obvious uh approach to<br>tackling particularly infectious<br>diseases but not totally and there are<br>many organizations in the world working<br>on one Health signed up to it World<br>Health Organization the animal<br>equivalent which is the world<br>Organization for Animal Health FAO and<br>various other initiatives and in fact<br>all the major uh public health<br>organizations in the world have signed<br>up to to a one health concept to there<br>is a lot of<br>activity as I say this very much applies<br>to infectious diseases it makes total<br>sense in of infectious diseases I and<br>and you may have seen this before but<br>this is a very famous quote from the<br>1960s and this was at a time when a lot<br>of antibiotics when antibiotic<br>resistance wasn't really a problem and<br>it was thought that actually we were<br>conquering infectious diseases and are<br>going to go away so this is a quote from<br>the Surgeon General in fact he's famous<br>for this quote<br>saying that close the infectious<br>diseases and clear the war gets<br>pestilence one apparently he he can't<br>remember ever saying but he's pous for<br>this quote and this is that and clearly<br>it was just so wrong um and this next<br>graphic is fairly complicated but what<br>it what it shows is over recent decades<br>the infectious diseases that have newly<br>emerged ones that we have never heard<br>about before or reemerged those we do<br>know that but have reappeared in a<br>different way or in a different<br>intensity and the blue there are are the<br>totally new ones and that may be because<br>they've been around a little time we<br>just haven't recognized them but some of<br>them clearly are completely new the<br>yellow are the ones that we know about<br>that have reemerged in different ways<br>and there's one there that's an aqua<br>which I just I like there which is<br>anthrax which is a deliberately emerging<br>one because of course in 2001 in the US<br>anthrax<br>um was deliberately um released as a as<br>a agent of biot<br>terrorism so there there are many the<br>world of infe disease I'm not going to<br>be without a<br>job<br>and so lots of lots happening and in<br>fact we haven't got this this isn't up<br>to dat we haven't got a we haven't got<br>zika I'm going to talk about those later<br>um the other interesting thing is that<br>most of these have a connection with<br>animals uh as a Reservoir or way to<br>transmit to humans that's that's an<br>important point and so I'll introduce<br>another definition zoonosis and these<br>are infections of animals that are<br>naturally transmitted to<br>humans and so zonic diseases or<br>infections we acquire from acquire<br>naturally from animals and that can<br>occur in many ways and don't worry too<br>much about the names and I'll go through<br>some as examples later on but this<br>graphic here is a the main ways that we<br>may acquire infections from animals one<br>way is through the food chain so from<br>food we eat that it's<br>contaminated um maybe through domestic<br>pets toxic plasmosis would be one of<br>rabies not in this country but in Rab um<br>or from wildlife and that example I gave<br>before mine typhus the cont the wildlife<br>will Road the Next<br>Generation and these are some of the<br>that easier to read these are some of<br>the more well-known zes the list is<br>actually a lot longer than that and some<br>you may be surprised so some will be<br>familiar with some you may be surprised<br>to see it's listed as a I guess HIV<br>infection you might not necessarily<br>think that but the origins are believed<br>to have come from a from non-human<br>primates in Africa and and a variety of<br>that virus and I'm going to go through<br>some of these just to give you an<br>illustration of the type of zootic<br>diseases and perhaps where that one<br>health approach can help in terms of the<br>way we try and Tackle these diseases or<br>better St a few records from the AUST<br>animal medicon<br>Australia um website and this is one<br>where this talks about zoonosis and the<br>burden of zos estimated $120 billion<br>worth um I think that's globally a year<br>um that the the burden<br>zes that um 20% of global animal<br>production is lost to these diseases so<br>has an impact on on animals that there<br>are many diseases that have prevent as<br>I've already mentioned that some are<br>preventable some are actually<br>potentially ER able to be eradicated and<br>rabies would be one example or a long<br>way off that but it's possible and the<br>fact that the animal health industry is<br>really very focused on trying to control<br>these<br>diseases and um a little bit complicated<br>but if you focus on the bottom line here<br>these are some of the more common Z noes<br>and where they've appeared over time and<br>the impression you get is that<br>there by the dots and the in the bottom<br>right there a lot more have emerged over<br>recent years and that may be because<br>totally new we don't know about them all<br>we just haven't recognized them before<br>but there are certainly changes in the<br>way we live we live in much larger<br>populations we can travel much more<br>easily and Cly good reasons why um some<br>of these may be more of an issue at the<br>moment and you won't be able to read the<br>details but just get the over this is<br>the list of notifiable diseases in in<br>New Zealand so these are disease we have<br>to buy law notify to medical officers of<br>health and what I've done the're mainly<br>infections and what I've done as Hollow<br>and yellow the proportion that have an<br>animal L that is z it so as you can see<br>it's a high proportion difficult to<br>gauge the burden though in the country<br>and these are<br>some estimates that are widely banded<br>around they may be overestimates but<br>they'll be roughly right um 60% of<br>nonhuman infectious diseases have a<br>source in domestic wild animal 75% of<br>the emerging ones and then agents of<br>potential agents of biot terrorism the<br>microorganisms that used like Anthrax<br>many of them most of them are as<br>well so here's some examples thought the<br>obvious one people often think of is<br>rabies and this is a disease fortunately<br>we do not have in New Zealand but for a<br>lot of the world this is is a um is a<br>problem and it's estimated that there's<br>probably one death every 15 minutes in<br>the world of rabies and rabies is due to<br>a virus um that's acquired from usually<br>from the bite of an animal infected and<br>the animal will be sick with the disease<br>and for some animals they become<br>aggressive and more likely to bite so<br>actually the max more likely to transmit<br>the disease once acquired it affects the<br>brain and is universally fatal it's it's<br>a truly truly<br>disease and it this mainly gos of can be<br>monkeys and the United States just R<br>I've seen what I thought was a a rabbit<br>cow not so common but um uh there are a<br>variety of animals that that are able to<br>transmit it um but certainly that major<br>efforts around the world to control with<br>cing of animals with vaccination and<br>other back home um campala infection I<br>suspect most of you have heard of<br>campala it's a bacterium um that causes<br>diarrhea it's a foodborn disease most<br>commonly acquired in New Zealand we T<br>Mania is from untreated milk but more<br>commonly in New Zealand from undercooked<br>established shows that link and and<br>there was a um a I guess a a good<br>illustration of the collaboration<br>between um variety of professions um<br>human health people Animal Health people<br>uh environmental scientists um to<br>actually address this problem in New<br>Zealand because it was noted uh through<br>the particularly through the 2000s that<br>it was an increase in incidence<br>um of Camp Back infection in New Zealand<br>and uh there was discussion about why<br>this might happen and good evidence that<br>it might be linked to under<br>P um is very frequent very high<br>proportion of poultry that fresh poultry<br>is contaminated with<br>canala um chickens carry it in their gut<br>and the process of um of Slaughter and<br>preparation uh the meat very commonly<br>gets cont<br>and so there were efforts uh and this<br>got very political uh and there efforts<br>L I think some key figures here Michael<br>Baker from University of T Wellington<br>njer French who a vet in um at messie<br>and others were involved in this and in<br>the end a variety of um interventions<br>were put in place increasing the party<br>on freezing chickens which reduces the<br>bacteria count amongst other things Leed<br>cases um salmonella another bacterium<br>that produces diarrheal disease and and<br>in this case I've got a picture here of<br>you know the sparrow speeding on the on<br>the plate on the table and I don't know<br>if you remember back in 2000 there was a<br>whole started sparrows were dying in New<br>Zealand there was a lot of discussion<br>about why they were dying and it was<br>linked to a particular strand s now<br>called<br>dt60 and this is is um this was not one<br>that we' seen a lot of before but since<br>that that time the first cases were<br>about 1998 but through the 2000s this<br>became a very common strain um causing<br>uh disease in humans and obviously also<br>some animals um throughout New Zealand<br>the probably first out large outbreak<br>here in chist church and sub<br>subsequently spread throughout the<br>country probably through the wild birds<br>and hopefully this is the work um thanks<br>to Nigel French at Massie at this<br>graphic which which shows where the<br>cases appear in the country and what<br>I'll just explain for a start before I<br>turn it on um these are various strain<br>strains of s the blue and the purple<br>dots these are just where the cases<br>appear over time blue and the purple are<br>some of the more common ones that we see<br>at the time um the blue one was<br>particularly associated with contactless<br>sheep and and the purple one associated<br>with beef and so these are human cases<br>the green ones are the ones associated<br>with the strain dt60 and what you'll see<br>is they'll start appearing around South<br>is Crash and being very quickly moved<br>into the north Arland so this is a over<br>a period of about 9 years so you'll see<br>it now suddenly in in South and then<br>moving through to the North and then<br>we're now in 2003 so that's three years<br>into it and uh over time still see a<br>much smaller number but the U<br>Persistence of cases particularly in the<br>SP another Zoro of infection that is uh<br>particularly common in New Zealand is<br>Leos spus is quite a different infection<br>this is actually the commonest<br>occupationally acquired infection in<br>these in um and it's it's caused by this<br>bacteria Li top and you can see on the<br>right there's a whole lot of them spiral<br>shaped<br>bacteria and they cause the disease that<br>can be very severe it's characterized by<br>Fever by headache by rash um it can have<br>quite M<br>complications<br>um and in fact this is<br>this of of how you get it disperses in<br>most parts of the world it's usually<br>linked to<br>rodents and who will have the uh who<br>excrete the bacteria in the urine and so<br>it's places where they exposure to ER<br>roed urine so it's often in uh fairly<br>poor um poor environments it's also the<br>sort of it's also the disease that<br>occasionally in a link ethic Steve G in<br>an adventure race in in Malaysia when he<br>was crawling through cave that were<br>presumably contaminated with rat<br>urine but actually the situation in New<br>Zealand is is very different and it's an<br>occupational disease It's associated<br>particularly with freezing workers and<br>the farmers and so the freezing workers<br>exposed to particularly the kidneys or<br>or urine in the slaughter house and if<br>they get their presuming through a cut<br>or onto them through the their eyes and<br>get acire the<br>infection for the famous new invention<br>on the right one of the the Milky shed<br>is are perfectly designed to transmit<br>neosporosis because if you think of the<br>the work here and if this these cars<br>decide to have a pee which out about ey<br>which is perfect so it's a great<br>environment to acquire Leos spirosis and<br>this has been a major effort um and<br>actually perhaps more the that's than<br>the human health people really to try<br>and uh control it the department for<br>Department of Labor and they can be very<br>interested in in this it's it's a<br>disease that has a can have a chronic<br>fatigues type syndrome associated with<br>it there certainly a lot of time of work<br>due to it so from the occupational side<br>there's a lot of interest to this<br>virosis and trying to eradicate it and<br>although it's grossly underdiagnosed we<br>probably have some of the highest rates<br>in in the developed<br>World<br>influenza um another Z confection we may<br>not think of it because we tend to<br>acquire from other humans but influenza<br>viruses tend to be maintained in the<br>reservoirs of of birds and occasionally<br>they transmit it to other animals pigs<br>in particular and we're often exposed<br>from the viruses from pigs and these are<br>often mixing vessels where the various<br>viruses are mixed Within These these<br>animals and they often mutate and new<br>strains appear that may cause more<br>severe disease they may be able to be<br>transmitted to humans and cause more<br>cause outbreaks in humans and<br>occasionally some of them can be<br>directly to be the bir ones can be<br>directly transmitted to humans<br>unfortunately we haven't seen outbreaks<br>that have being too big there have been<br>some reent locally big outbreaks would<br>have often caused quite severe disease<br>but these new strains that appear have<br>been the focus of a lot of attention and<br>concern about new pandemics that will<br>sweep the world a lot of concern about<br>infuenza but there other respiratory<br>viruses you probably remember<br>SARS which stand for severe acute<br>spiritually syndrome it's about 2002<br>2003 there was sudden an outbreak of the<br>spirit illness in south southern China<br>took a long time before they um actually<br>managed to diagnose what it was and<br>there was a lot of political involvement<br>in that was thought could have been<br>influenza but turned out to be this this<br>virus with Corona virus that had not<br>been previously described and what was<br>also a feature of this was how rly was<br>transmitted um around the world with air<br>travel and so there's a big outbreak in<br>particular in Canada but in Hong Kong<br>and particularly around southeast Asia<br>and there are a few cases in New Zealand<br>as well the animal link there um the<br>Civic cat in the bottom and and the<br>horseshoe bat are thought to be<br>important in these speciically in South<br>China and their proximity to markets<br>humans was thought to be the origin of<br>that and then subsequently spare human<br>human there's another one more recently<br>may or may not heard of which is called<br>Ms which is the Middle East Respiratory<br>Syndrome virus and it's a related virus<br>Corona virus again and this is one<br>that's emerged out the Middle East and<br>it's linked to to bats again you'll see<br>that bats are a very common source of a<br>lot of infections to humans U and a few<br>other animals but also camels and an<br>actual fact the the main um transmission<br>is is probably the contact with bats and<br>camels and this is and this is once it's<br>in the H in humans there is transmission<br>from humans to humans so again this is<br>one that has been uh transported around<br>the world with with air travel and this<br>is the the latest graph or match showing<br>where cases have been we haven't had any<br>in New Zealand yet been a few suspected<br>cases<br>um but we're all on the L for cases from<br>people who've been through the Middle<br>East I think the one particularly to<br>note was the the number of cases in in<br>Korea and this graph at the bottom shows<br>the number of cases over the time was<br>this big peak here but this one here is<br>uh cases in nearly 200 cases in Korea<br>they were imported by one traveler and<br>and he was a businessman man be in the<br>Middle East and went through even though<br>there's hard awareness even though he's<br>known to be in the Middle East He<br>Slipped through many there were many<br>many points where it could have been<br>recognized that he was carrying this<br>infection but they were missed and then<br>the hospital where he eventually ended<br>up and the infection control was<br>suboptimal and there's a lot of spread<br>within the hospital among other patients<br>and staff and a lot of lessons learned<br>and there was actually quite you know<br>the bur the resources involved to get on<br>top of the outbreak were quite<br>momentous Ebola of course we've heard a<br>lot about ebola recently and and this um<br>this is another infection caused by a<br>virus it's one we've known about for<br>some time but tended to be relatively<br>small outbreaks uh in certain parts of<br>Africa it's a very severe disease um<br>causes fever and internal bleeding and<br>with a very high mortality and very<br>readily trans transmitted human to human<br>so health workers are at major major<br>risk of of acquiring from from treating<br>patients so lot of the photographs of<br>you see people with their their personal<br>protection and of course this outbreak<br>recent outbreak actually still hasn't<br>quite gone in in West Africa that mainly<br>affected three countries guine s Leon<br>and Liberia was unpressed in terms of it<br>numbers the number of cases were greater<br>than um ever any the other Eola outbreak<br>and as you see here are nearly 30,000<br>cases and approaching 12,000 deaths it's<br>a huge burden on some very very poor<br>countries with limited resources and and<br>the the ecology what we understand we<br>still don't know a lot<br>abouta but we believe that it's<br>maintained in certain forest and jungle<br>environments probably among bats and<br>possibly spread between bats and some<br>other primates and so certain situations<br>when humans are exposed to that sort of<br>cycle is when we start to see human<br>cases and um and it's been implicated in<br>in people going hunting and Association<br>getting bush meat and so a lot of these<br>primates and bats are consume this food<br>and presumably some of them are infected<br>and actually the virus is probably<br>behaving like it's always done the big<br>difference here is the greater<br>populations and the increased Mobility<br>people that has probably spread it into<br>the major urban areas which hadn't<br>happened in the previous a<br>outbreaks so you can see here and and<br>the control of aowa has very much relies<br>on a multidisciplinary approach it's<br>been vets doctors environmental health<br>people it's it's a very good example of<br>where the one health approach is is<br>really the only way that we're going to<br>be able to manage these sorts of<br>outbreaks and try and prevent them<br>happening<br>again<br>of course I have to mention zika um zika<br>is is another virus and it's one<br>transmitted by certain mosquitoes and um<br>it's one that's we've actually known<br>about since the' 40s so in fact if you<br>look at the graph it goes through one to<br>one to six and one is where it was first<br>described among monkeys in Uganda in<br>1947 and in 1960 there a few human cases<br>in Nigeria<br>1970s through to<br>Micronesia about 2007 then we had in<br>French Polynesia in fact very close to<br>us in the South Pacific and then of<br>course in Central and South America<br>ongoing<br>outbreaks and what we know um there<br>seems to be the cycle that and as when<br>it was first described of it being<br>transmitted among primates in certain<br>parts of the world probably Africa has<br>been a main part of that but probably in<br>South America as well and then humans<br>encroach on that cycle um they can it<br>can be transmitted and certain<br>mosquitoes not every mosquito can<br>transmitted so it requires certain<br>species of mosquito so in fact the<br>distribution of this disease is very<br>much depending on where those mosquitoes<br>lives do they live in New Zealand we<br>don't have it here we get may get some<br>important cases but we cannot pick up we<br>cannot it cannot be transmitted in New<br>Zealand because at the moment we do not<br>have those types of mosquitoes we have<br>other mosquitoes but not these ones<br>and in fact this is a um it's a an<br>infection that causes fever and aches<br>but actually it's it's not a very severe<br>infection and we probably wouldn't have<br>heard much about it apart from the fact<br>that there's concern about pregnancy<br>pregnant women and that babies<br>developing with very small heads mic and<br>that has been the major concern and that<br>wasn't something that was recognized<br>early on when Zeke was first described<br>as something more recent and so we're<br>still learning about it uh is generally<br>thought to be true but we really are<br>waiting good data on that at the moment<br>so a huge amount of research that's<br>ongoing at the moment to try and um<br>risks and I thought I'd just mention one<br>which which is certainly a very personal<br>one for me and a very local one which<br>has um very much an environmental<br>component to think of one Health humans<br>animals the environment we think that<br>often is very dominated by doctors and<br>veds but actually the environmental side<br>is is is very important as well here's a<br>disease very New Zealand disease that<br>has a very important environmental<br>component that is vitamin and hand St<br>disease so leg disease is is a type of<br>pneumonia and the main difference is<br>it's caused by a particular bacterium<br>that we call<br>Legionella and it often causes very<br>severe disease it's not actually<br>transmitted human to human when I say<br>that<br>my slide is SL the other day because the<br>first case of human to human<br>transmission has just been described but<br>basically it's acquired from the<br>environment and for most of the world<br>it's from water environments but in New<br>Zealand because of the strains that we<br>have it's more associated with soil and<br>so this is the It's<br>associated with people who deal with<br>Souls areally gardening so this is a<br>garden disease in New Zealand so we see<br>a very big pey spring and summer people<br>get out into the garden um it's much<br>more predictable pink and influenza<br>every area so we know in Christ Church<br>yes particularly around November um and<br>has been linked to to potting mix and<br>we're working on some studies at the<br>moment looking at the risk factors uh<br>it's it confirms that association with<br>potting mix and it's probably certain<br>behaviors if you washing hands seems to<br>be important in preventing it um maybe<br>one or two other factors as well but<br>that link with with compost is is very<br>important so here's the situation we<br>actually uh engaging with soil<br>microbiologists another uh environmental<br>scientists may be actually quite useful<br>in terms of trying to sort out you know<br>how we can prevent this should be quite<br>preventable and gardening many people<br>Garden very few people get legioner<br>disease so it's actually just trying to<br>be able to find ways that we can prevent<br>this severe disease happening in those<br>few people who are engaging this healthy<br>activity and this is uh this is from the<br>ministry of Health's safe gardening<br>handbook so it talks about what to do<br>with handing handing potting mix and and<br>trying to prevent engine<br>disease I'll just mention one other<br>thing which is is about antibodies so<br>again you've probably been hearing a lot<br>about concerns about antibiotic<br>resistance and the fact that one of the<br>antibiotics we use uh rapidly um are not<br>being as are now not as useful against a<br>lot of the bacteria that cause important<br>infections in fact the the bacteria<br>winning the race at the moment in terms<br>of the fact that we we cannot keep up<br>with the rate of resistance that's<br>happing that's major concern enough that<br>wh World Health Organization had a had a<br>world anti about awareness week last<br>year<br>and the ways that antibiotic resistance<br>develops and and we often hear the<br>overuse of antibiotics antibiotics used<br>to uh unnecessarily the overuse this<br>will promote resistance um and uh the<br>transmission hospitals well there's also<br>a very important animal aspect as well<br>as large amounts of antibiotics have<br>been used um uh in farming and animal<br>production in fact New Zealand used to<br>use a lot more compared to other<br>countries were not nearly as bad as we<br>used to be but there were vast amounts<br>of that used both to treat problems but<br>also as kind of birth supplements as<br>well um and it's not hard to imagine<br>those animal animals produced for food<br>that have been treated with antibiotics<br>and developed antibiotic resistance<br>organisms and that end up on the table<br>so there's another root um of acquiring<br>resistance and it's one that is we're<br>very much aware of and addition to<br>encouraging people to use antibi when<br>they need to the healthc Care<br>Professionals don't prescribe it when<br>they need it with policy makers there's<br>also um within the agricultural sector a<br>lot of push to minimize use of<br>antibiotics and use it will necessary<br>again another example where the one<br>health approach is<br>vital and I focused on infection but<br>just a couple of things at the end non<br>infectious this was um pointed out to me<br>recently where in Scotland was concern<br>about domestic violence vets and other<br>professionals have been um trained to<br>recognize domestic violence so this is<br>an example where professionally mully<br>disciplinary approach to the recognition<br>of domestic violence and and in fact in<br>New Zealand it's the same so in fact New<br>Zealand vet<br>Association has a program as<br>well and of course there there is quite<br>a body of literature which I won't go<br>into on the benefits of companion<br>animals as well mental health and other<br>medical problems so although I focused<br>on infectious disease because that's my<br>there are other aspects of one Health as<br>well and lastly I thought I'd just tell<br>you a little bit about what we're trying<br>to do in New Zealand um with the one<br>Health and we have initiative we're<br>calling one half TI Ro um and it's<br>really based around a cab oration<br>between the veter school at Massi and<br>the T Medical School New Zealand we have<br>one veter school and it's a fantastic<br>veter school it's in the top 15 in the<br>world it's the only one in the southern<br>hemisphere that's a reference center for<br>the World Health<br>Organization equivalent um but it's<br>unusual in the world that the vety<br>schools are a university that doesn't<br>have a medical school so we don't have<br>those opportunities to interact like<br>many other others around the world which<br>is crazy<br>um and so we are um at the moment trying<br>to build that collaboration I've um I've<br>got a photograph of my partner in crime<br>deel French who's a professor of um<br>veter public health and food safety at e<br>nessi and we are trying to lead an<br>initiative based around the<br>collaboration between our two<br>institutions but not exclusive to that<br>so in fact we are trying to engage uh<br>all stakeholders around New Zealand<br>Crown the search Enterprises the um<br>various government<br>agencies other organizations that are<br>interested in one in one health concept<br>and we we've started by a number of<br>joint projects and they don't just<br>relate around zis there's actually some<br>very generic skill sets that we each<br>have that actually getting together and<br>talking about things um we were able to<br>work together very well so in fact<br>Nigel's involved in the project has<br>nothing to do with animals it's to do<br>with transmission<br>of Staff among school children but he's<br>an expert in modeling um how<br>transmission occurs and so there are<br>there it's not just about<br>the we've organized joint meetings and<br>regular visits between the campus and<br>high level engagement and sharing of<br>that<br>expertise and I'm also getting involved<br>in teaching and learning so I have mag<br>position at Massie and N position that<br>they target and they're trying to get<br>involved in each other's teaching<br>programs and we also Al here have our<br>first vet academic pppa Scott joined our<br>group a couple of years ago she's a a<br>vet who's trained in in human<br>epidemiology and has been a real asset<br>to us both and BR understand the human<br>side and um the animal side so she's she<br>is very important in in our<br>aspirations and we had a a few people<br>here I now recognize we're at that<br>meeting but we had a meeting a couple of<br>weeks ago in Wellington which we<br>organized relatively late um know I were<br>busy with other things on the shoe<br>string and we Mas 100 over 170 people<br>very quick in very short time to come<br>along through virally the whole duration<br>of a two-day meeting um people from<br>about 45 different institutions from<br>purpy located in Wellington to get<br>government agencies along very high<br>level representation from m Min of<br>primary industry and and Ministry of<br>Health and and other agencies a highly<br>highly successful meeting that really<br>underscored the interests in the country<br>and the need for that sort of networking<br>opportunity and so we're going to run<br>this as plan to run this is an annual um<br>activity and just get extraordinary<br>range of presentations in one place was<br>was unprecedented in my<br>career and also talk about the the<br>education aspect and the Massie group<br>have have done amazing they've got an<br>amazing program in South Asia funded by<br>the World Bank and the European um<br>commission they European Community they<br>uh in these countries in South Asia sh<br>on the map here have got a program of<br>training vets and and medical doctors in<br>public health and epidemiology and<br>outbreak control in the program and this<br>is they get through it they get a Massy<br>master's degree a lot of has done by<br>distance learning with uh projects based<br>in their home<br>countries and it's a highly highly<br>successful program and I had the chance<br>a couple a few weeks ago to to visit<br>some of these trainees and sorry about<br>the poor photograph obviously they five<br>of the brightest most engaging uh<br>students I've ever encountered and these<br>are young Nepali students three them<br>events ones of biot Technology<br>has bi technology background one's a a<br>doctor and um theyve been trained<br>through through this Messi program and I<br>learned another thing about Massie is<br>they have their own time zone so this<br>was in one of the study offices there<br>where they were keeping in touch with<br>their um their mentors back in New<br>Zealand and then just to finish there<br>obviously some areas where that one<br>health approach can be useful and just<br>to some more topical issues that you sin<br>that may or may not have been linked to<br>to uh to let us um and the controversy<br>around that that was a good example<br>where one health approach is is useful<br>in um in outbreak investigation the<br>whole business about what wasn't fism in<br>the end in Frontier um you know<br>engagement of um early engagement of the<br>right expertise within the sort of one<br>Health Group probably would have<br>prevented all of that um and then<br>obviously there's a lot of you know<br>issue ongoing<br>issues the as well and fing as well one<br>health approach useful and I thought<br>just one political commentary to end<br>this is you may have seen this in the<br>Press think was Friday um Tony ke<br>professor of my department here he was<br>actually home onw but he was prompted to<br>write this from our prime minister<br>stating that why haven't we got the<br>Harvard agricultural<br>New Zealand brilliant and it was a<br>wonderful piece where tmy pointed out<br>that you know you need the investment in<br>well I think we actually have the same<br>for one Health I think we are in a<br>really uh interesting position and not<br>unique close to Unique position with our<br>Reliance on primary produce and in a<br>fantastic vet school and a great medical<br>school and a country that can get on and<br>do things it has Global rid within the<br>one half Arena as well something that<br>can be special so I'm going to finish<br>there um I just have to acknowledge I'm<br>always the danger of not putting<br>forgetting people this is the core group<br>that I work with on one Health and<br>mainly from from Massie andago<br>questions questions or comments for<br>David<br>is there a potential um worry that the<br>animals that are deem to be the the<br>sources or the the containers of some of<br>these diseases say in Africa would be<br>targeted I'm piing particular primates<br>and things like that by the<br>uninformed oh I think that's absolutely<br>right yes and I think that has happened<br>in certain areas I mean I mean a lot of<br>the terrain is is where where the<br>reservoirs remain actually tough and it<br>would be but I think that<br>has<br>eradication think clats in some areas<br>have<br>beener but a lot of a lot of the efforts<br>obviously probably best be focused on on<br>how those interactions with humans occur<br>you it's not eating will be a good you<br>know good but you they're obviously<br>cultural aspect in I was had a meeting<br>in Geneva about the whole response to<br>Eola outbreak and one of the the key<br>lessons that came is you need social<br>anthropologists early so in fact to get<br>people the social scientists in early to<br>actually be able to deal with some of<br>these not late which tends to happen you<br>try and solve and you realize you need<br>people to understand the cultural issues<br>to to put in these interventions so<br>important<br>just curious I was struck with an<br>antibiotic<br>resistant uh pneumonia C here at<br>pneumonia a while ago and there was a<br>lot about it in the paper and it<br>honestly sounded as they were all get<br>Dro down there don't hear a thing these<br>days what's happening with C here<br>pneumonia we are to worri about it and<br>the fact that's as a bacteria there has<br>one hasir a lot resistance and<br>particularly strands that have come from<br>the Indian subcontinent and an actual<br>fact um there a very high prevalence of<br>those bacteria so Indian subcontinent<br>becoming un well you know not not as no<br>I know that but there's been so there's<br>a concern because of of that situation<br>where it might with people's<br>travel where those really resistant<br>organisms may be introduced so we still<br>see them we watch out for we fortunately<br>don't see large numbers of them and we<br>haven't had any exan crushes that have<br>been totally resistant we other places<br>but we are worried about we don't you<br>don't all need to be a lose sleep over<br>it but you we do and um so it's still<br>yeah it is still there but the numbers<br>rating D you me emerging<br>diseases to what extent do you think<br>some of these diseases we hear about now<br>are actually<br>emerging communication through travel<br>and hearing more about them getting more<br>media I think it's all of those in fact<br>the term emerging um you know it's been<br>used as a kind of I mean there's now<br>there journals emerging infectious<br>disease and people use it to get their<br>research funding and all the rest and<br>your departments so<br>but these infections have been emerging<br>and reemerging forever and so I think we<br>just have what we're seeing is a mixture<br>of all of the above ones we just haven't<br>seen before but they've always been<br>there ones we would have never heard<br>about but the know communication is such<br>that it is we were able to hear about it<br>and there are something that are truly<br>new so I think it's it really is a<br>mixture of all of those I mean what you<br>know the big message is things are<br>changing and you know we see new<br>affections come and go some more serious<br>than others and we need we Nimble and in<br>fact one of the main messages from that<br>meeting I went to was actually we need<br>to be quite different in that approach<br>we need to have good leadership we need<br>to involve a lot more disciplines we<br>need to be faster ways and be flexible<br>and all rest you know so in fact the<br>appro it's really changing the way that<br>Community uh you didn't mention the uh<br>resistant<br>tuberculosis I could<br>have I guess I was focusing and and<br>repeat the question right sure yes the<br>question was about drag resistance<br>tuberculosis concern about that I guess<br>I was mainly focusing on um the kind of<br>the links with animals and of course<br>there is a link of animals for some<br>types of tuberculosis but the more<br>common one is very much human to human<br>transmission and and there is a big<br>concern around the world about the<br>measures of of resistance and the that's<br>resistant to all anti now if I can just<br>dra a slight tangent on tuberculosis I<br>mean the uh there is a particular ISS<br>and other issue in New Zeal tuberculosis<br>they Bine tuberculosis one the species<br>that is more linked to cattle and that's<br>one that does cause problems in New<br>Zealand it's actually probably spread by<br>uh good Australian impulse that the<br>brush tail posum which doesn't happen in<br>Australia it happens in New Zealand so<br>that's a particular issue occasionally<br>causes human disease more commonly<br>causes livestock disease and the<br>problems that that's one of the problems<br>with<br>the do we know why there isn't that<br>pum Link in Australia yeah I've asked a<br>lot of people I think it's the answer<br>that comes back<br>partially is I think there is a closer<br>contact in New Zealand Catholic and<br>supposedly but I'm just not sure that<br>explains at all the C<br>differences is<br>yes I think there was something to do<br>with the nature of the contact and how<br>frequently that person will come in<br>contact<br>with<br>fire you a curly one where does par<br>yellow come from par yellow fever I've<br>never heard the ter par yellow fever I<br>carry it I got it from a contaminated<br>shop in the Army in 72 I can't pass it<br>on I can't give blood because that will<br>pass it on it's a test it's consider<br>Nuance it's probably got another<br>name in UK referred to it as par yellow<br>fever it has all the symptoms half<br>yellow fever stain sweat staining things<br>and<br>so<br>fever right I will look it<br>up I've never managed to find out very<br>much<br>about but it's I've had it since<br>72 they told me it would burn its way<br>out in a few years right<br>has<br>poti yes so the question was about<br>climate change and how the vectors for<br>these infections can change and and<br>that's<br>been subject of of considerable interest<br>because the range of particularly<br>mosquitoes is is often determined by<br>temperature so at the moment we're just<br>off the mar for some of these potential<br>vectors we're just outside that the idea<br>of temperature range it won't take much<br>warming before there will be some parts<br>of New Zealand where<br>um an encroaching mosquito may be able<br>to survive and breed and establish<br>itself so therefore there would be a<br>risk of so edti the actually other Ed<br>pacce the mosquito it's one of the<br>potential vectors of Dy and zuka could<br>become established and of course these<br>are ones that have been<br>found uh with the surveillance around<br>the Air Force in pter than and so some<br>have a right that have can survive but<br>concern you mentioned when you talk<br>we're using less antibiotics for feeding<br>animals for growth are we doing enough<br>yet and what more needs to be done yeah<br>probably not um I gather it's much much<br>less than used to I mean the quantities<br>were truly Industrial<br>of antibiotics that we use as grow<br>supplements and um my understanding is<br>is a clean up the a lot um but I think<br>there's still more to do from what they<br>say so you know and there were huge<br>efforts to responsible in that regard um<br>New Zealand's clean bra imagees is<br>something they focus on and clearly it<br>right Le<br>from just picture<br>yeah well so the question was about we<br>one ke Christian Kik is about one half<br>set<br>with government but yeah in the<br>countries well it's interesting because<br>Steven Joyce knows the term so that's a<br>spark and it's actually um making the<br>and so you know our conference in<br>Wellington which we always have in<br>Wellington you know we we invited people<br>to come and address certain issues and<br>they had won Health hundreds of times<br>you those so their efforts to actually<br>um make the concept uh bit and the<br>Infectious Disease as well communal<br>disease we have very very poor<br>leadership in New Zealand centrally very<br>very poor and um there's you know<br>there's a vac there's a void there that<br>we are actually hoping to fill in Way by<br>show that that happened in in the UK a<br>lot of issues around antibiotic<br>resistance and communicable diseases<br>things only really happened when some<br>you know good leadership was shown by<br>who stood up and said actually you know<br>this needs to change in very positive<br>way that they kind of filled that gap<br>for a while until things picked up and<br>that's actually the way the nly view it<br>in New Zealand at the moment so you know<br>we we want to have regular meetings with<br>key stakeholders as part of oneth that<br>too right and advocacy role and you know<br>in a very positive way being in their<br>face about it because there's actually<br>this wonderful expertise in the country<br>and people to get on and and we should<br>be able to deal with some of these<br>issues very quickly rather than have you<br>know some of the issues that we've been<br>having sh talk so I think it I think<br>that's that's where we're what we're<br>planning to do at the moment but it's<br>getting the interest I mean we totally<br>Blown Away by the the engagement at that<br>Symposium um and I think we just have to<br>going May last question I'm curious<br>I think I think complete eradication is<br>is very very unlikely<br>um there there are a number of I think<br>what we'll see is is we will see a<br>number of diseases we will be able to<br>eradicate and there are some so we've<br>eradicated small PCY we've eradicated on<br>one one of the four STS of Poli already<br>so that two successes through<br>vaccination there are certain ways that<br>make them easier to eradicate some are<br>very difficult to eradicate but there<br>are others on that list measles we<br>should be able to number other so there<br>will be some that we'll be able to do<br>that others will be m in control but I<br>think what we'll also see is the way we<br>respond to new infe disas will be a<br>little bit more Nimble and the way we<br>actually deal with things is a bit more<br>holistic so I think the the approach<br>will be different I think but the think<br>is gone I mean there's so many different<br>infectious diseases so some they're very<br>very different and some are impossible<br>to eradicate we just need to have a<br>different approach to the more but it'll<br>be a different<br>approach TI with that it's near 8:00 and<br>thank very much for an excellent talk<br>appreciation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
