evening ladies and gentlemen I was<br>given voice on the news about high draft<br>roster it is my pleasure to introduce<br>the series of pictures that are we click<br>on at the spot this is the third length<br>of publications and tonight our next<br>with intuitive artificial heart<br>officials so my kind of business to<br>university of otago star was trying to<br>be a position and well it was recruited<br>to traffic for billionaires um after<br>further training he's being a couple<br>years of Scotland before coming Dexter<br>trusted the end of the 1980s when I<br>think I see 16 water can be promoted to<br>professor in our public medicine trusted<br>so many years now mark has been directed<br>on what we now call the traffic carbon<br>structure which is the biggest research<br>group whether the plastic pellets it's<br>also a lot of the last building five<br>years he's actually Hill Abdullah corner<br>so he spends part of this year at Russia<br>a part was here in Singapore with<br>building collaborations around heart<br>disease research across countries and<br>hospice innings ah is rather after a<br>resurgence and cigarette dinner tonight<br>mr. gruesome to talk about the<br>Oh Chris such a cold wet night and<br>you're here billing it would show so the<br>help importance of having a good human<br>heart so do hearts what I've got no idea<br>who knows what about hearts here so I'm<br>making have suctions this is art who are<br>these it's serving the middle of your<br>chest for this and it's got bits it's<br>got bits that allow the blood to go<br>every bit allow about to go out it's got<br>a squeezy thing that makes its own gives<br>a false it's got valve sets up and make<br>sure everything goes in the right<br>direction some sort of a blood supply it<br>causes a lot of trouble these buggies<br>that seemed to be the ones that get<br>narrowed and logical skoura knees are<br>tax because what a brief and here's a<br>wiring system so that all topics in the<br>world that spiral from the appropriate<br>order and the valves get open closed the<br>right way the blood actually tends to be<br>on our direction it's also cause a lot<br>of trouble you can get short circuits<br>here you can I go out which is obviously<br>bad or it can kind of rest like you've<br>got a front of a classroom you<br>accelerate at the same time which is<br>also a thousand whatever stands valves<br>max let's go one way so you go muscle<br>that's fly wiring and vast and all of<br>these things can play and in that<br>syndrome that we call half thing so how<br>far they can be the end result the whole<br>accumulation of different abnormalities<br>of injuries to your heart and I guess<br>the most common goes narrowing of<br>blockage of these vessels in common well<br>Gardenhire creature which there are many<br>adults of the age of 40 degree<br>electrician now rather a lot of the<br>thing the heart it never has a day off<br>and if you live to be 70 in<br>you were possible walkable lack your<br>heart will be 2 billion times there it's<br>also a full night factory this is<br>something that people don't arm know if<br>you talk to people who are some medicine<br>and that's something that we have been<br>involved in that aspect of heart for a<br>long time it's been different lat the<br>gland is like fire which produces the<br>hammer and that's so so I've got a bit<br>about endocrine glands while my<br>audiovisuals be okay online this is<br>their plan so intervene glands are<br>things like pancreas produces firewood<br>introduces floor mat so insular<br>organizes your sugar proper levels for<br>life you don't have any problems if I<br>don't wear glasses your metabolism so<br>arrest me more under worked and these<br>glands produce box or chemicals that<br>shoot out into the bloodstream go and<br>work on other parts of the body to exert<br>their effects and we didn't think the<br>heart wasn't anything like that before<br>how's essentially the efficient pump as<br>i described but actually the other<br>that's um this is about the other issues<br>about you have disparate they're doing<br>the other tissues actually we do so the<br>size he rolls which are small proteins<br>for peptides and these actors warmers<br>just the same way the five remaining<br>preserve<br>land or instrument Mozilla pancreas<br>cortisol adrenaline comes out the<br>adrenal next the heart has its own<br>particular set of hormones that I'm<br>going to spend time talking about oh how<br>many visual aids okay so there are no<br>life sayers heart disease we have a<br>syndrome called heart failure is<br>probably a misnomer it probably ought to<br>be called heart injury or heart and p.m.<br>at without damage because half day it<br>sounds terribly fine but a lot of people<br>live a degree of karaoke in leaky valve<br>so degree loss of muscle function some<br>miss wiring smart little infidelity like<br>a little these things for a very long<br>time and with quite a good quality of<br>life that looks really optimistic but<br>actually being my screen down here looks<br>this one looks fine it is like off quite<br>not doing it so we also have various are<br>not very probably as a personal injury<br>might be more helpful nevertheless if<br>you do have significance of payment of<br>your action the net does carry quite<br>severe significance for the person<br>concerned in the family and we'd like to<br>Yeah right so there are wondering of the<br>human and the type of neutrons<br>completely false pretenses I knew that<br>it will must refer listen to stand up<br>comics then to academic lecturers so I<br>thought I fossil the good humor or Tyler<br>Mac you think you are going to something<br>amusing and interesting but uh she is<br>slightly relevant because humor is a<br>word that is in reference to different<br>body arts if you like and then actually<br>Briggs 2400 years ago there abouts<br>people like Aristotle and Plato and the<br>properties he still has an oath that we<br>say occasionally they believe that the<br>body's health and well-being was reliant<br>on about four chief fluids of the body<br>and these fluids of humans blood fling<br>yellow bottle network and the spider of<br>humor has actually lasted so the war<br>restarting the front of your eyes for<br>aqueous humor and the jelly in the<br>eyeballs called vitreous humor and then<br>we talk about our hormones as being<br>cured or neuro humoral systems so in<br>fact the heart produces hormones it<br>would human heart the best action out of<br>it that's my excuse for title so whose<br>room are so is about how you would for<br>me to fire halfway up at physiological<br>state in which an abnormality of carrier<br>functions responsible for the failure of<br>the heart pop love in a rate<br>commensurate with requirements this<br>analyzed my petition the short version<br>that is the haps damage that can't pump<br>blood properly to the tissues destiny<br>now there's a lot of us around so here's<br>a purlin of the world's population<br>bloomin on the side<br>so different age groups is your creepy<br>way out this is updated sometimes when<br>it's up Dean and we can use it to have a<br>bit of a static how many people suffer<br>from heart failure we know them some<br>carefully study populations within<br>Brisbane this is the right about 1.3<br>2003 year of those over 25 years of age<br>another about seven billion of us now<br>and about fifty eight percent of us over<br>25 years on this planet which means them<br>up for more billion for over 25 and if<br>you use that Rachel apply that means<br>about five million new cases of half a<br>year and the overall prevalence cause<br>you don't because of he betta carpets on<br>you know fall outside the balance<br>somewhere about 25 millions of 15<br>billion people only one time they might<br>say well straighten your hair doesn't<br>have to apply to lots of the risk of the<br>planet amazing progress on a bad idea<br>but having spent six years in singapore<br>now i think that the asian rate of heart<br>failure is actually higher than anywhere<br>else most athletic single biggest power<br>failures there which means probably the<br>Western countries are looking at most<br>risk so that's a major global problem<br>now some questions just to break you up<br>just to make it work a little bit so can<br>you imagine amongst the causes for<br>tuning out of hospital being and visit<br>its inclusion depression in adult we're<br>getting half photographs 135 so I have<br>number three lots of hands five just<br>about to be hands on one and number ten<br>I how so obviously not a thread is the<br>popular actually it's not it is sooo<br>much common reason for that I was paying<br>dividends or difficult wards in Western<br>countries and now almost impossible<br>since incubation one of the common<br>things that have their imposes on people<br>is this disparate sense of recklessness<br>which can be marked when they're at rest<br>or it can be very difficult electronic<br>climb steps or it can just be<br>troublesome at any other time so<br>breathlessness as a characteristic a<br>heart failure because lots of different<br>things make you breakfast in references<br>about the sort of third or fourth most<br>common overall reason for people tuning<br>after the emergency department Alabama's<br>so you imagine you've got this crowd of<br>people in the emergency department the<br>primary problem if first complaint is<br>that the feeling accountably she was<br>breathing let's go home the last few<br>hours would you imagine that and that's<br>those ruthless people haven't we've got<br>half failure to explain that something<br>I'll see the show of hands please the<br>plaque seems that was taking their<br>Tencent you're going to get a compound<br>of damage your 9pm sentence to relaxing<br>Suzie s and fifty percent actually it's<br>25 it's a lot I've got sure it's like<br>one more of these so evil he's gone<br>again slightly back<br>other we did pinned directly by opening<br>one more question so how do our dogs so<br>how easy it is a for a doctor to decide<br>why are you breathless this is obviously<br>of some importance to the person who's<br>panting in the emergency department and<br>also after the doctor who is trying to<br>sort you out and move on to the next<br>discussed this so being certain why<br>someone a short of breath in the middle<br>of the night a blockbuster of the case<br>all the time or uncertain the case must<br>the time so without ever seen of it what<br>percentage do you think might be<br>uncertain of the diagnosis of half our<br>winners the year or not the facebook<br>breathless person up to a boxing montara<br>if you try to appease divison few hands<br>three bucks it a must and fifty percent<br>so actually now operas are inserting at<br>least packaging<br>I which kind of worried business but<br>living their share of thing is that<br>we've been privileged and also that they<br>actually take steps to a swash the<br>uncertainty by giving additional<br>information over time it's just that in<br>the first 5 10 15 grams reinvesting<br>someone with worthlessness the<br>possibilities are pretty broad and it's<br>very hard to be certain quickly in many<br>cases so just to summarize all that<br>there are a lot of people half they do<br>it is a common cause of admission<br>they're probably over 30,000 Kiwis you<br>have this Commissioner a living from<br>that it does carry i did a sister<br>council considerate without having<br>people with this condition still be with<br>us and five years time hath or not and<br>if you look at the combined if it from<br>the World Health Organization World Bank<br>and the others presumably come to a<br>conclusion taken together there what<br>right thing to do from nineteen ninety<br>two twenty20 and skinny pharmacies which<br>is the primary battery properties i<br>mentioned rings about number five in the<br>entire planet an item that is actually<br>set to become the first cause of death<br>and loss of quality of life as well with<br>the next short period of time so i<br>reckon that's do our industry that it's<br>a ver problem is continent by series and<br>of course some of you in the room i'm<br>sure yes just animals or family<br>experience so you have an introduction<br>to in our to our hearts because a lot of<br>what we do in our church means upon<br>giving a look at the heart and in<br>relation weather<br>looks the way our measurements of<br>Governors including these hormones of<br>outcomes it so this is a heart it's a<br>normal part and it's not just our image<br>and you want to mention that the probe<br>of the ultrasound device is sitting here<br>pointing out from the LA to LA back to<br>the shoulders and neck so that ask us<br>upside down leakage and these past the<br>range of our members that if ensures big<br>thick walled powerful contracted check<br>this thing that looks like data outside<br>is the right edge very different shape<br>rather different pressures and function<br>and these two bits a bottom two<br>zhanjiang does the atrial the reservoirs<br>and the thing that's waiting at how to<br>get that is about and actually controls<br>flow from this chamber to this chamber<br>where you can't see the pipes being in<br>now the whole art but this is the<br>standard kind of image that we use to<br>assess how well our hearts doing in half<br>family studies in a pursuit we do a lot<br>of this kind of immature media's<br>probably hadn't even done for one reason<br>or another and it's kind of a workhorse<br>piece of information that we were like<br>lot of us what other things that we<br>measure it's good so get that image in<br>your head it's moving well the walls get<br>thicker one is contracting it moves<br>symmetrically are all moving together<br>the vowels are waning vigorously since<br>my god flow going from here to here what<br>we're interested in is kind of gift from<br>that this is the same coach are just<br>smaller version I made it Corner how do<br>we get from that to this now shower<br>hands couldn't see a difference between<br>these two ah there's a cheaper<br>so the other last corner you can see<br>what we call who are classical reduced<br>Egyptian rationality and you can see<br>that instead of contracting in a<br>symmetrical way effectively it's almost<br>rocking back and forth instead of<br>squeezing which is essentially a lot of<br>wasted energy it's not a nice book or<br>shakes or last rep your type awk show<br>has actually become more soccer ball<br>jokes round spherical net 60 pretty<br>inefficient shape and look the world is<br>still waiting enthusiastically can<br>barely get out of its own way there's<br>almost no flow of market or not ever fly<br>them from here to it and our search has<br>really been faxed a lot and how are you<br>having to get from this day so that it's<br>not something you may think well broken<br>valves malfunctions we have a heart<br>attack sucker punches but actually<br>there's kind of a game them time and<br>quite often you can see someone to<br>people perhaps with a similar heart<br>attack it cut a little rather the same<br>from the end of the bid the head of Sam<br>sort of damage as far as we can tell<br>them on day 12 and the bloodiest we do<br>to look for that image that looked<br>rather similar and then we come out a<br>look at those same two people two months<br>later my heart it's time to look like<br>this and the other one will like this<br>won't look back so there are a depth of<br>mechanisms for busy busy can be very<br>very like I understand what about we<br>recycle understand what we could measure<br>early on that can help predict who's<br>going into this and therefore perhaps<br>sticker earlier and more thicker by than<br>we currently do how does a common head<br>slide that race and I can deal that it's<br>about the units that I was talking about<br>the healers lineup as good as the bad<br>guys and there are a whole bar shouldn't<br>they have interesting names like really<br>intense now<br>a person in the field it's not only<br>batteries these things get turned on<br>when the heart is damaged when the heart<br>is unable to sing flow adequately to<br>different tissues and that creates a<br>bodily response which turns on these<br>humans so we'd sure now these formats in<br>an effort to actually retain salt and<br>water inappropriately retraining Solomon<br>was great that you're having to be<br>bleeding or here at the desert<br>dehydration it's really the wrong thing<br>to do in your hearts injured but our<br>audience among tells you you have to<br>know that evolution hasn't pulled out of<br>that oh yeah I am how is actually got a<br>bright idea so these are good guys if<br>you have a cardiac injury they tend to<br>relax the blood vessels to give the art<br>this we were to put against tends to<br>open up your kidneys so that your damage<br>and salt and water things remaining<br>better balance so and a half failure by<br>definition things have got out of<br>balance these people or entities have<br>started to when's the scales are<br>acceptable automation and so the short<br>version of that of course is that you<br>are overwhelmed by back here and i will<br>now our focus on risk tool on this<br>particular part I for the good side<br>because we have spent a lot of time<br>effort and made something of a a marked<br>for ourselves and investigating these<br>things from cardiac injury recently<br>applies naturally really just means salt<br>releasing more encourages release of<br>salt for the kidneys hip Titus<br>leadership project they carry a metric<br>so this electron micrographs quite<br>famous comes from quite a long time ago<br>964 and you can see it's a slider what a<br>bit of heart muscle looks like these are<br>the muscle fibers within the self heart<br>but then they're cool they are he's evil<br>Jasmine later Johnson was key which is<br>what i use and slide the screen looks<br>like something that you find Henry so<br>far away rather than so it's one of the<br>first fence that the heart was acclaimed<br>as well as apart and these granules<br>actually grow a number and intensity or<br>sure depending upon death of the body is<br>rather fly above water salt or the<br>pleasantly we ensure that the rats and<br>officially can clear the heart of<br>synthesizing these small proteins though<br>in store these granules and they were<br>released when the heart require some<br>change or relief from this is the<br>subtype there's a a being seen by<br>cutting edge which we refer some of<br>these only people say the ones that have<br>really made something of an impact on<br>real life tons of work and so being the<br>or benchmark cutting metric your time<br>starts off inside ourselves rather long<br>form the string of beads that looks like<br>something on Nicholas is actually<br>extremely you know acids little building<br>blocks of proteins so this is a 100 next<br>amino acid protein it gets chopped about<br>here and missed out across the whole<br>ourselves that love into the spell that<br>doesn't work the sort of thing that time<br>is that kind of motif like<br>almost in this bit which doesn't do any<br>work but actually floats around and can<br>be detected and barclays can be used as<br>signals because there are the blood can<br>take a blood sample you can measure it<br>and if the liver of these things has<br>something to do with how well you're up<br>is is not perfect then you can get some<br>interesting<br>formation from wheat a particular<br>problem this one to me and Rollins team<br>in our biochem student discovered us we<br>never theory that they had to be there<br>but it was actually Christ to people who<br>proved it was there in black and<br>secondly that it really was serially<br>totaled a lot about the status on so the<br>story is naturally years over the last<br>day smoke all these dates on the slide<br>and I have a theater class you choose<br>it's been quite a long story which is<br>still actually hung reveling in serious<br>ramifications we found by having a look<br>at them artificially synthesized being<br>the aim thing that have a lot of useful<br>actions man whistles relax it would<br>suppress things that we don't want can<br>gather their adrenal glands river our<br>kidneys to produce more flow releases<br>salty water and it will do quite will<br>chance to our tissues of the stops from<br>over growing cells or scar of that and<br>it would kind of feedback against<br>overloading anything that weakens that<br>are damages that can potentially<br>strictures and James the pressures<br>inside and it's that stretch that seems<br>to trigger the release of being thing so<br>it's kind of like a Pandora's box of<br>good things for Dennis parts and one<br>pathway that the film downs really you<br>could use these things that beefy in the<br>Avs therapies are not going to talk more<br>about that tonight the other half comes<br>from the space the more the harm is<br>loaded the more i am here deity get out<br>of the bus true so you're assuming<br>waving their action to try to take those<br>sort of use and that's really the basis<br>of the rest of the talk so we started<br>looking at these are images and the data<br>collected by Richard Chapman is one of<br>our key<br>members and this is I heartless clearly<br>struggling very badly and you can cover<br>everything or an ejection fraction<br>ejection fraction is just a fraction<br>morning it's like that that gets<br>squeezed out with each cycles of heart<br>relaxes and fools squeezes and empties<br>and it's really about thirty percent of<br>its volume on all these squeeze this<br>heart speeding up doing that would be<br>like ebooks we need to 15 cc's we love<br>have a bunch of bailouts and we found<br>that the law are a lot of the Egyptian<br>freshman probably isn't obviously all<br>bad certificates were out yesterday the<br>lower rate ejection fraction got the<br>high as you can see the screen also a<br>little bit the right ventricle which is<br>that data show thing attached to the<br>around the face of it lyrical and its<br>importance it sends blood to the lungs<br>that has a number of functions that we<br>can't really do without and you can<br>measure how well or how about its<br>functioning and greater person or<br>moderately severe and empirical generous<br>we've now that the more damage the right<br>as you grew ask the higher the Big Time<br>Lords of the black these are pictures<br>using a certain modified ultrasound on<br>Google Doc rock sound or color coding<br>and if you look at this particular image<br>here you'll see every now and again it<br>gives the squirt is a bright<br>multicolored speaking staff across the<br>bottom of the screen that's actually a<br>lot Lincoln vigorously back sort of<br>damage leaking much without from limb<br>integral back into the action where it's<br>not supposed to be because there is no<br>longer working that's obviously a stress<br>on the heart extra load it's good like<br>walking through passes forward and then<br>driven and having to take one back all<br>the time and also it's a consequence of<br>heart failure from other causes so here<br>stretch your art by having a heart<br>attack or having an indirect rhythm then<br>you'll find that the rim that keeps the<br>vowel closed gives of a nice eating<br>supper stretch the whole world will<br>begin to leave so leaked emails from the<br>other callers or a consequence of heart<br>failure anyway we did find that the<br>linear valve was interesting<br>bolivia developments in the more the<br>more elevators of the peptide via the<br>authoress AT&amp;T was so weird in the<br>picture now the most anything that<br>occurs that adds extra load it unload<br>pressure mode bartley bit of damage<br>muscle almost anything you can do to<br>make my heart of your heart will produce<br>a higher level of interpreting these<br>squirrels represents the kind of<br>pressure on Zoila faction better move<br>higher that pressure is once again the<br>hard edges so all of this makes you<br>think the bad of a husband is my heart<br>ripped either this name of that relates<br>to what happens to you then need very<br>rapidly found out that's the cam so<br>these are people that have suffered a<br>heart attack might have infraction of<br>your life and that's obviously a very<br>obvious brush injury to your heart it<br>produces a major trigger for generation<br>release of the integrity of thing then<br>we found that if you had some of the<br>heart attack if you had a little peptide<br>that was not too high actually only a<br>couple times about normal perhaps then<br>your chances of being alive three months<br>later after how about a hundred percent<br>and these six hundred plus people if you<br>are on the other side of that divine and<br>you hit a high level higher than the top<br>part of the group there's something much<br>so I always think well the spin think it<br>tells a little bit about what the future<br>holds for individual maybe initially<br>help us diagnose the condition in the<br>first place of where otherwise possible<br>as rivers people in the emergency you<br>can go back to there and start using it<br>back there that lead to local with nine<br>ed which was positive and then turned<br>into a collaboration these are data i'm<br>going to show you from four countries<br>working together austin the u.s. battler<br>ourselves<br>so masters Netherlands and we between us<br>recruited about to 150 of those<br>reference people turning after the EEG<br>and ask the question does the level of<br>the help you pick out which ones have<br>heart failure which was there something<br>else we know that the faster you make<br>that diagnosis the sake of that person<br>is released harder to spending hospital<br>the better their chances of getting out<br>in good shape the starting out of<br>hospital the longer you lead us to make<br>that decision when someone's actually<br>sufficiently ill without further to<br>watering their loans and to be gasping<br>for breath a few hours are they then is<br>a very bad thing to incur so something<br>you want to get right through with them<br>why short space of time can it be<br>anything else do there but bula like<br>that the answer is obvious I work a<br>bathroom so if these twelve hundred and<br>fifty people we found that you could<br>pick apart Hartford for not having this<br>is a being literally the scale and most<br>people have no intent upon as I guess<br>they're anxious their estimate their<br>heroes problems these are people who<br>clearly had acute heart failure it keeps<br>loss of ability of the heart code of the<br>circulation of cute accumulation flu the<br>middle of tissue and these people have<br>had some history of our troubles but<br>it's not actually the reason I day the<br>difference between the skoda given<br>medium level this one is about 40<br>thoughts is a very big change its color<br>over that so you have to test out<br>performs as a as a real kiss we found<br>another interesting things we found out<br>testers and flores by agents like this<br>is known as about these sorts of graphs<br>always go over very quickly this is a<br>member of receiver operating curve and<br>it's a plotting of sensitivity of the<br>tea<br>in other words the percentage of those<br>that have got the condition in a car<br>with positive test better sensitivities<br>against the specificity of it is the<br>numbers that don't that our negativities<br>and ideally at one or simple or positive<br>people have got the condition to have a<br>prospectus or people our condition and<br>negatives test don't work like that it's<br>a bit of over connections so you try and<br>get the best room you can happen if it<br>were a better test this line methoxy<br>ever troopers in different blood varies<br>from different people but actually sit<br>right here by the horns will be a<br>perfect but if it were totally useless<br>test would be going down this diagonal<br>here to cool the line no information<br>which is where I really like to Charles<br>are filling the line this is a<br>statistical methylation and what you<br>find is that if you are young when you<br>give your half they listen 50 years it's<br>almost a perfect test it will give you a<br>positive result 99 a single time can be<br>quite specific as well if you get into<br>the stage route 50 or 75 we must keep in<br>the room set it's still very good test<br>it's actually a lot better for example<br>then prostate-specific antigen prostate<br>cancers or mammography or breast cancers<br>butt have started to get a little bit<br>weaker and then in the over 70 fires we<br>have this heart failure classes do a kid<br>then it's still good we'll have six as a<br>good performance but feeling you get a<br>bit of damage and your other things of<br>the theory of relatives so we found that<br>you have to take over to account and<br>grab a deal with that just by having<br>little that allows you to rule out heart<br>failure so it isn't sufficiently love<br>doesn't matter how old you are still<br>very unlikely that you've got and then<br>you have a rule insist you start<br>thinking about their age and use another<br>battery to see a lacrosse player lockers<br>like simple single numbers like life to<br>be feeling clear we have nowadays<br>the spelling of integrating them through<br>the beginners perform pretty well the<br>sensitivity of NightA magazine that<br>means that if you have hundred ruthless<br>people sitting in front of you 68 got a<br>heart failure then ninety nine percent<br>out of those 16 but almost all of them<br>will show a positive tips which is what<br>you want if you want to be that's what<br>the emergency department of it was what<br>the ed needs is to be able to feel<br>confident that they're not since our way<br>and appropriately well not listen<br>exactly they're not to worry about false<br>positive results the people to get<br>labeled and probably need to be sorted<br>out later because they usually brought<br>into the fold now be assessed analyzing<br>reassessed letter the dream of singing<br>someone home so we just feeling a bit<br>anxious or not well adjust sensitivity<br>of magazine that's probably the other<br>hand cardiologists don't watch in these<br>walls and slots flooding into the award<br>with noncardiac not heart failure<br>conditions so that I purchased determine<br>who has actually thought it rather than<br>who has a pot and that's going to use a<br>rule in Delhi and we found that these<br>numbers do improve performance so the<br>young people four hundred and fifty<br>fifty is only five nine hundred and<br>oversee ives 8american us if you do that<br>what gives an overall accuracy of<br>ninety-three percent that means if you<br>stack all the essence of notes together<br>there are all the possible results<br>you'll give the arts of your eyes<br>ninety-three percent of the time if the<br>only thing you do is measure this blood<br>test in reference people and of course<br>it's not the only thing we do so will be<br>Adam minimal training our ability to<br>take story to take into consideration<br>other test results and background plus<br>our usual wouldn't chart we should give<br>the answer right how was it<br>we don't actually know that we do it<br>really well it is dusk compass on what<br>to achieve that and other consequences<br>is that this test is balanced way into<br>international guidance for diagnosis and<br>management of heart failure of the world<br>this is a diagram that comes out of the<br>European Society of Cardiology<br>guidelines and how to diagnose and treat<br>heart failure and you can see that if in<br>tune up an acute onset is the Restless<br>person leading then integrating appears<br>as part of that sort of sequence of<br>assessments that you would do to try and<br>arrive at will you go heart failure or<br>not and if you're not then I'm well<br>we've got a lot of time to touch on but<br>if you every one of the more wildly<br>effective people were too much earlier<br>stage demon would use it differently<br>preventing probity and that appears in<br>the guidelines on this side of the<br>equation and this is one sided a tragic<br>the other side the North American<br>continent Heart Association and the<br>American College of Cardiology you also<br>have guidelines who solely invoke use of<br>being the orange appropriately to trap<br>people make this incision and then I<br>practically what you can do it at sage<br>is Facebook car like this and stick it<br>on a doctor's top pocket or back pocket<br>and you know a poem about that<br>breathless person in front of them just<br>mere just means references and they've<br>done these things measure being<br>integrally now it's dysentery hundred<br>others shouting your death master and<br>very very unlikely see if anything about<br>other things first rather than on how<br>that I was way over here fifteen<br>thousand and the orig value song is<br>actually got the genuine article is<br>about five or six hours it's very high<br>so it's over 10,000 then you think about<br>my treasure and maybe pay attention to<br>things as a senior officer prioritize<br>the big thing if you're in the moment<br>you have to thank and my friend Jim<br>generosity and Boston humble start with<br>their iphone study he provides this car<br>with an additional instruction which<br>reads so basically we saw anything so<br>these things with some a little there a<br>fascination for the greater are those<br>people are set above the 300 rule out<br>the lower the 450 gone of their own 50<br>the other members of America's any<br>Barbara see it happens there now harm<br>those people turned out to ever go<br>anywhere so that is considered to be<br>heart failure to prove otherwise their<br>whole group called the red zone there is<br>only about fifteen percent of those that<br>you'll see the scripts a little more<br>surely but it's going to have liberals<br>that are a pagar be normal so once again<br>you tend to regard angeleyes so this<br>will leads on from diagnosis to<br>management's or above a psychic someone<br>has heart failure or chemically the<br>right diagnosis have got a multiple<br>right communication got them out of the<br>EG into a bed and hopefully back home<br>another four or five days what happens<br>next we know there is a lot of 4 from<br>half a year after the initial relief<br>initial treatments / place it's become<br>something of a obsession with the<br>musical world that half very classes who<br>tumbled hospital wit lives when we sit<br>at home we actually know that was about<br>30 days of court ruling will be back<br>again and they look fine the day you<br>sitting out of door you don't seem to<br>have gas meter if you actually they were<br>fine i'll get out of their top can't<br>everything belongs you're like nicknames<br>I understand there's no swelling around<br>relieves things look good and your<br>Australia buddy anything circle to go<br>but 14 comes back within 30 days so be<br>quite nice to have some<br>clearly our ability to assist Vince<br>isn't up to it because I have some kind<br>of an extra signal or message or marker<br>that were couples say actually you are a<br>genuine there are ready to go don't keep<br>businesses start a rather long road it<br>stretches up from over time since the<br>year 2000 so I'm going to give the<br>rationale behind the idea of using<br>repeated measurements not just a one-off<br>for AT&amp;T for managing your heart rate<br>half owner can be staged this is an ABCD<br>station Aegis means that you're a human<br>being passively you carry a purse which<br>most of us do like a time a 45 it might<br>be harder pressure or diabetes with<br>dyslipidemia were about family history<br>of some combination of those things but<br>actually you're well and someone looks<br>at your heart with an ultrasound scan<br>like that echo is nothing to see and you<br>can function warm you scurrying busted i<br>stayed up baby is when your heart might<br>be showing something on an image it<br>could be the walls putting against the<br>blood pressure and starting to show<br>strain it could have a little bit eerie<br>of muscle that's not very possible<br>probably because it's lost its blood<br>supply but actually you still gotta feel<br>useful function ok so you've got some<br>structural change but it actually is<br>subjectively well stages seeing the very<br>good so this is where you've got half<br>that I mean oh God safety is when you're<br>really sucking out of the fears and<br>getting ready to go<br>he staged from this continuum the terms<br>of the next appropriately adds extra<br>information about just how bad you are<br>about what you work out the future can<br>hold hang on so here's some data from<br>people who are mounted in half they do<br>and are stable or treatment and I tend<br>to pass on the trial which is to see<br>whether a new medication won't make a<br>difference and as part of that that had<br>been taken and tested when they first<br>came into the trial and again four<br>months later you can see someone start<br>up pretty high today there are some<br>flowers and some change camps upwards or<br>downwards and it's interesting Lee this<br>patents related to what happens to them<br>lot of 4 months but actually two years<br>down the track so at two years the<br>number of people who have distance to<br>summer by that time the high high corner<br>of those people were lost my to use the<br>local Oh much smaller business and then<br>you can change from one of the other<br>actually serving your destiny change<br>from Russell into something rather more<br>sinister or go the other way actually<br>rather better so the Liberals related to<br>your outcome and the change in my<br>liberal is also related to your outcome<br>so if we push the hip time around a lot<br>of only three people can they actually<br>push me out comes around sliding in<br>those thinking birds what we're thinking<br>about and how reinforce that fear that<br>we know that this communication which<br>people in this room and Beyond I'm sure<br>we know that if they weren't in the mark<br>the integrated EMP goes down so that's<br>signals that maybe we could adjust<br>dosage of any or many of these things by<br>annotations of cereal measurement so<br>that anybody better than just using a<br>secret pants approach or a couple of<br>Roger animals approach which is what we<br>usually have sinned and we fight through<br>them aside the eruption chart and<br>they're studying the energy thousand<br>personal blog trouble he basically<br>started to grow through history of other<br>locals in u.s. not ever that was Europe<br>Netherlands Austria ourselves behind<br>opening with a bigger study bits to<br>Scandinavia the US in and visit Europe<br>and whole series of trials trigger or by<br>our idea lead by mature and Gary at the<br>beginning of the century we fire drill a<br>pilot state will show that tops the idea<br>that repeated measurements change<br>treatment according to a measurement as<br>well as to using clinical the signals<br>you've got a bit a result and we<br>launched the larger trials involve some<br>hundreds of people we call a bad scar<br>it's an acronym I think it stands for<br>know how I've been to the side the way<br>this works is the thing that were<br>admitted to hospital kind of clinicals<br>episode of our failure they are they<br>went to our usual form here well they<br>went into the research broker and<br>unusual here involved this three-month<br>follow-up but we did interfere with the<br>usual management the other two options<br>here intensive thora either clinically<br>based intensifies we're just trying to<br>do all the things that usually do that<br>do it very much for dental you're going<br>to the absolute Israel we saw people<br>more often than usual we follow the<br>guidelines to<br>to an absolutely team and the other work<br>we did the same thing we added on<br>nt-probnp measurements and whatever<br>dream that we were given through this<br>route if we still had a radius integra<br>PMP level we will increase therapy<br>anyway even if a person seems to be fine<br>even if we thought we were we should<br>have better because we've got a mind<br>that not only does 357 people come back<br>in after a month at a hospital but over<br>the next five years perhaps half of<br>these people are going to die so the<br>stable half and conditions not<br>necessarily which is that we can't see<br>what's happening very well so we're<br>using the similar to kant's get a better<br>handle and react more effectively so<br>that I have three monthly visits what<br>everything look around which means from<br>Hindi probably until it was a load of<br>the school we were shooting for all that<br>we sing more often with additional<br>changes to treatment if the DMV stayed<br>up and then at the end of the time we<br>took a look at the we found that it was<br>a split so that we had an entry effects<br>of people that were truly in the older<br>we only actually over 75 we had a clear<br>benefit impose that there was someone<br>good it turns out it's not actually an<br>age that matters it's really the number<br>of additional conditions you have<br>trouble you there access to buy our<br>killer this is the home and garden throw<br>that you can see that it's mortality has<br>been much much reduced by the strategy<br>this is a bio references the same thing<br>it'll be the blue bars these are the<br>emissivity passage about art out of a<br>population they have this kind of<br>increasing forward is rated favorite<br>year for three years if you give usual<br>care it's twice that much over three<br>years and if you actually intensely<br>follow them clinically that don't use<br>the superdome use the engine for a B&amp;B<br>then actually have a little bit of a<br>game the first year but you lose rapidly<br>it's just not their artists reviews so<br>we took us to mean that at least and how<br>they are very popular<br>it was a chance but making a big<br>difference to our comes over a period of<br>some years of this and it's nice time<br>for operation of your River so at some<br>time her growth in Europe was launching<br>a very similar study that would have<br>time to see at you I think better<br>scalable system they chose that and they<br>found over a short period was about 18<br>months rather three years that he went<br>in supply chain to publish they need for<br>my daughter troopers here's a standard<br>River that overall survival tended to be<br>the peppers the other more people<br>formula just time goes by the red line<br>it's not quite statistically significant<br>if you look at the number of people who<br>came to the hospital to repeat episodes<br>of heart failure the amount was affected<br>by the strategy and they also found that<br>there was a problem to do with age so in<br>the top brass these are people under 75<br>and you can see that survival is clearly<br>in for it to be honest of advice and<br>time out estoril free of heart failures<br>really improved but if you get into the<br>operation of these lines start over<br>there so we don't do harm here by these<br>different strategies but we don't make a<br>huge difference and as I see a growth<br>industry so things with honor about 14<br>or 15 places I expect you to memorize it<br>stable chest you able to benefit rally<br>that a lot of studies and that there<br>were various regimes that are very<br>different from one another some had<br>hundreds and hundreds of people some<br>very few people some had y equals John<br>has 62 61 is there ever change some<br>other thanks Lee and some had one time<br>it for trying to reduce the hips are and<br>some have an alt tag and electron means<br>that<br>I shouldn't probable that entire idea to<br>design use that char analysis now all<br>these people were kind enough to respond<br>to richard rosen and garen bulls<br>prospective and brazil provide all their<br>data sort of people with the whole world<br>experience 14 15 years to see whether it<br>will get up whether you can see an<br>effect at school meta-analysis and what<br>am i there is is that it needed it so<br>that if you took a period of two years<br>and all the experience more of these<br>trials it should actually say nt-probnp<br>garden because small depth i wasn't used<br>for master photographers not use there's<br>quite a big change between survival<br>using one approach to deal with the<br>other and that distinction and<br>difference of about thirty percent<br>improvement as it over two years the<br>spiritual sort of thing you would see<br>with introduction of a new successful<br>drug is the kind of difference that a<br>significant sum to reciprocal offers<br>made is the characters that beautiful is<br>made of heart failure well this is not a<br>beating in your dedication it's just<br>using them differently different<br>tributes to adjust your dose oh so<br>that's their tune guidelines changes as<br>well so he's the American guidelines now<br>and they are conceded that we have class<br>lunches at this kind of recommendation<br>of the highest recommendation but the<br>best part of it is that you can diagram<br>is not that it with Ichiro being big and<br>you can get an index or an indication or<br>severity or it's not look that were more<br>cautious about saying repeated<br>instruments can give you a better way<br>adjustable dose of the sensible guide<br>item and days<br>this therapy the short version all<br>letters and half our measurements market<br>can help you find the heart failure<br>predictor bad news what's in heaven and<br>God your treatment to get it more<br>effective that so my nearly five slide<br>in indy program is really the key<br>contribution comes from here and an<br>underperson national practice of our<br>faith we can really claim that we've had<br>an influence on the world it helps us<br>find more diagnose heart failure it<br>predicts what happens in half idea you<br>have to use a osmotic student Sarah<br>measurements help God truth and improve<br>outcomes of those are my main messages<br>now as i get older i thought i had<br>horrible people to acknowledge and thank<br>so just be really so a lot of people out<br>team and they are from phil different<br>fashions and every once in a while we'll<br>get together and get a really surprised<br>or the others on the team perhaps this<br>happened last year so they're people<br>that do as national patients they<br>recruit people for observation studies<br>or four different adjustments in therapy<br>and we're leaving at a quite complicated<br>program in hartford and announced led by<br>richard richard travel and this team<br>lorraine and other letters these<br>photographs are all but of course the<br>history of giving us reaches over time<br>so you sister excuse garen it will scare<br>legal group of that stage this is the<br>marvelous travertine or the immunoassay<br>team lavake routine and it's kris benson<br>who is currently boys the bosses some<br>you know and really do describe<br>nt-probnp quietly suit himself there any<br>conspicuously revision I haven't seen<br>much about jeans and things that turn<br>genes are off but this is the team that<br>there was laughing in an elitist they<br>become a priest<br>cool dress and not talking and tell us<br>about that this leadership group we<br>generally you are a one another we try<br>to pretend you know that are going to do<br>next with managers and ultimately<br>succeed the real stars our patients and<br>we have different views of patients that<br>we have accumulators or normal<br>volunteers at the looking like over a<br>long period of time if ever leaves<br>numbers together it comes to more than<br>10,000 Souls and we're very grateful to<br>them we're also grateful for ones that<br>then you can excellent off of about ten<br>bucks for comments or questions or<br>directions yes which I could say yes but<br>it's nice so it's very pack change so in<br>places that have got Brad familiarity<br>with us it is routine use it's very<br>common to use it as an initial<br>diagnostic test of Griffiths people so I<br>was surprised when I was able to find<br>that people were measuring integrate<br>into the evil master sprinkle there's<br>other things like Japan artifacts living<br>user to see really to God and adjust<br>treatment that's so quite contentious<br>over large areas so the meta-analysis<br>that I've showed you comes from sort of<br>14 I guess pioneering spots around the<br>globe and that seems to be a fairly<br>conclusive result but it's murders that<br>guideline that I showed you in the US to<br>say if you're in a good part favor<br>center then you can use these<br>measurements to help you and get optimal<br>dosing in place it doesn't say you ought<br>to do it for everybody it's kind of<br>reserved recommendation in some places<br>are not doing it at all because of<br>things to do with reimbursement the<br>costs of tests the way the health<br>structure is set up there is a study<br>underway in the US which might swing<br>that in quite possibly class soon it's a<br>study for guidance and what they've done<br>the air is take the crew from the little<br>analysis and the work done here and<br>password and in Europe and they set out<br>a multicenter study<br>based on us and they're looking at<br>people in a particular kind of cardiac<br>look better arts with the winter action<br>and they are using them in a cereal<br>regarded child using angle sunlight it's<br>about 2,000 people be recruited in<br>sports I think their recruitment is also<br>must complete so they'll be looking at<br>their results and probably report on<br>that resolve some time 317 so the answer<br>is some places users many places do not<br>overall opinion is drifting towards it<br>slowly and that's actually a way things<br>happen and then some of texts whether<br>it's a treatment or a test looking one<br>other prime example which is troponin<br>which is a blood protein that leaks out<br>of your heart is exquisitely sensitive<br>for demonstrating damage so ourselves is<br>what we use for acute architects to take<br>people off to the car became appropriate<br>treatments and so forth well that isn't<br>awkward teen years to be accepted even<br>after the evidence was absolutely online<br>I think ng grab it is a little bit like<br>that it's got very wide upcycling want<br>you to imagine it's not the envisions<br>envisioned millions of times per year or<br>raft below that their particular<br>application repeated serial measurements<br>on the systematic fashion that's still<br>not standard around pic botha mon<br>and biotin think a lot of local people<br>hidden always been illegal I don't<br>having it on why was that am I to<br>understand that there could be<br>definitely yeah well actually when we<br>say goodbyes we're going to university<br>of things so hip tire supplier to gap<br>physiology lung hearts all kinds of<br>aspects of your body most of which never<br>really go anywhere near<br>performance-enhancing territory there<br>are some quinoa my you're interesting<br>things that they do think mainly though<br>anabolic steroids which is not it has<br>another part of chemical structure<br>they've been used and abused in sport<br>Nora poison this kind of appraising Nick<br>ties a kidney product that brings up red<br>cell generation production and some<br>people have dug themselves without to<br>try and get a higher natural I rinse elk<br>and a high oxygen carrying capacity and<br>that's on wireless and pepper we're<br>involved with trying to figure out a<br>system for group test of doping into it<br>in there fast so I kind of spread up but<br>a tertiary there by our society yeah is<br>the baby that we briefly now sup like<br>to our now you've got we have a better<br>footing because I'm not dead certain<br>current practices in our research trial<br>we are measuring their current trials<br>look again they're very different here<br>from a patient getting relatively<br>hospital to the month was their final<br>appearance the trials that I've shown<br>you are sort of in the chronic phase<br>when you think the girl things are<br>accommodated and then the context of<br>that trial we are reassuring integrating<br>the in Guinea eruption results and go<br>whether you need it in the Indies<br>medical diagnosis you do more than an<br>hour to and I think that is actually<br>technically feasible possible to do here<br>I don't know how possible it's actually<br>going because it does boil down to<br>individual physician practice for family<br>doctors it's available on at least and<br>anybody who's kind of and of us and can<br>say go doctor in a non-urgent setting<br>and so I'm just bit of sugar breath not<br>being thus destroying my ankles and the<br>majestic they will help out with that<br>half adder case early or recipient power<br>failure so that is about really in<br>Singapore for some reason it's become<br>hyper available so they do try to around<br>and also in the duty issuing more<br>visions and then probably actually short<br>so I'm not giving you a very precise<br>answer ago example or handsome as<br>hospital right now I know what happens<br>in our search program but exactly how<br>easy it would be for daily traversing<br>registrar on the wall here or some of<br>these days we get it was over quickly I<br>don't know technically it should we go<br>captain's or not really i'm short<br>because demands and logistics you look<br>whole populations we know that focus<br>differentiated by six or so leaving<br>David to the different segments of the<br>population some of these things yeah<br>everything live stream anymore but so I<br>guess by and large it isn't the<br>universal marker so one of the things<br>I've done recently is look at a whole<br>bunch of Griffiths people coming through<br>the either hear of a team in<br>Christchurch and with the cooperation of<br>the versions of that the doctors and for<br>look at parallel coming through last two<br>westerns are brittle sticklers in other<br>crushes why British people at another<br>Singapore and does the test work as well<br>there as it does here you find major<br>differences so careful city Singapore's<br>the focus of the Chinese predominantly<br>with some Malay about teams in a few<br>odds and soft layers its patriot and<br>Westerners constitutes what we find<br>there is the reference people it's in a<br>much younger and they have rather less<br>complicated disease in the subgroup that<br>has heart failure is smaller so really<br>speaking Singapore that turn out of<br>their heart failure twenty-five percent<br>actually the series we did hear a price<br>change the tune out of that failure of<br>about third and the ones that we saw a<br>median age and New Zealand 17 years<br>older than people will
