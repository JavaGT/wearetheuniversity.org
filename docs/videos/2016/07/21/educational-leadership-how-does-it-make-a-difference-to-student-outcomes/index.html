Dean<br>perhaps my passion for educational<br>leadership came from a family of<br>teachers and principals but also<br>surprise surprise from my stint as head<br>of school when I realized at not that it<br>was not only important and extremely<br>difficult to do in an academic<br>environment but I became aware of the<br>attributions that others make about the<br>importance of leadership and I wasn't so<br>aware of it until that time so good<br>research things come out of being a head<br>of school for those of you that are<br>contemplating it policymakers<br>politicians and the general public have<br>absolutely no doubt about the importance<br>of school leadership to student outcomes<br>indeed parents use it the quality of<br>leadership or what they think the<br>quality of leadership is as a way of<br>absolutely no doubt of its importance<br>and yet paradoxically researchers have<br>had huge trouble both testing and<br>demonstrating the link between the<br>quality of school leadership and student<br>outcomes whether those outcomes are well<br>being social outcomes or academic<br>outcomes in the sense of achievement<br>measured over time are you learning and<br>perhaps one of the reasons for the<br>difficulty that researchers have had in<br>making this link is that<br>long causal chain between school<br>leadership and outcomes because school<br>leaders exercised their influence<br>indirectly by creating the conditions<br>that make it possible for teachers to<br>make a bigger difference with the<br>students that they're working with so<br>that's one reason why perhaps it's been<br>so difficult to demonstrate or test the<br>strength of this link and the other<br>reason is perhaps that educational<br>leadership research has been theorized<br>or at least the measures that have been<br>used to assess the quality of school<br>leadership have been based on business<br>and management theories of leadership<br>notably a theory called transformational<br>leadership which assesses the extent to<br>which leaders have such qualities as<br>charisma able to motivate the followers<br>are able to provide intellectual<br>stimulation and individual consideration<br>so in other words the qualities that<br>were assessed were the qualities that<br>are generic to leadership of any<br>organization missing from those measures<br>in from those theories our engagement<br>with the work of Education engagement<br>for example items such as our school<br>leadership or the principal of the<br>school as reported by teachers because<br>it's teachers that complete these<br>surveys about the quality of school<br>leadership that my school principal<br>gives useful feedback to teachers my<br>school principal works with teachers<br>learn from students work about how to<br>improve teaching etc those were missing<br>so that led to questions that I had and<br>the Ministry of Education head who<br>funded this work that led to a question<br>about what happens if we can sort the<br>research into measures which have<br>actually tried to access the education<br>the specifically educational features of<br>leadership versus the more generic and<br>so that's the result that we got from<br>the first meta-analysis is that the<br>transformational leadership studies have<br>shown an a average effect of leadership<br>on student outcomes of slightly less<br>than point to and it's what's called<br>instructional leadership in the United<br>States measures of leadership that the<br>third of theorized and more educational<br>teams are showing a considerably greater<br>impact on student outcomes still not not<br>large but Utley but they're the relative<br>difference is quite important these<br>studies were theorized is a miscellany<br>of a whole lot of other different<br>theories but in terms of so that's<br>that's interesting that's showing that<br>maybe we need to attend to the way we<br>theorize a measure educational<br>leadership if we're going to look for<br>these effects and maybe educational<br>leadership needs to be thought about at<br>least in terms of inclusive of the<br>educational practices involved and the<br>educational knowledge but these are<br>still very abstract conceptions of<br>leadership and if we're thinking about<br>how do we take the this knowledge into<br>the possibilities for intervention and<br>for leadership development on which<br>millions of dollars is being spent<br>OECD countries and indeed wider than<br>that just talking about instructional<br>leadership is far too abstract<br>conception so the next question we asked<br>is well what are actually the practices<br>involved can we see these practices and<br>more detail can we learn about the<br>relative impacts of different sorts of<br>leadership practice and that was our<br>second meta-analysis which a team of us<br>did and it shows some of the average<br>relative effects of dimensions or sets<br>of practices so we can create something<br>of a story about how leadership makes<br>its effect through setting goals and<br>expectations resourcing those goals<br>getting involved in the work of<br>monitoring overseeing being close to the<br>work of teaching and learning and this<br>one is a biggie which is learning with<br>your teachers and supporting that<br>learning both formally and informally<br>and all on the foundation of an<br>environment of context which is<br>culturally physically and socially safe<br>and inclusive for both staff and<br>students so those are some of the things<br>is something for some of the relative<br>effects that we have based on the<br>research evidence that we had at the<br>time and since doing that work our<br>research team involving a clear summer<br>my dad really favored myself Rackham ire<br>and some of our students has been<br>looking at this second question if we<br>think about these as sets of practices<br>that we know something about the wealth<br>of effects of those practices on student<br>outcomes and quality of teaching next<br>question is what are the capabilities<br>that leaders need<br>in order to be able to engage in those<br>practices so our current research<br>program is looking very much at how do<br>leaders build the trust that they need<br>in order to do the work of improvement<br>which involves solving complex teaching<br>and learning problems and bringing your<br>educational knowledge to bear thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
