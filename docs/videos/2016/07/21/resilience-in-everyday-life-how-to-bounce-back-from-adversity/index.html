accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen for<br>people who don't know me I'm Peter I'm<br>University ofo<br>CL and every year we host a series of<br>public lectures and tonight is the first<br>debate uh that will be delivered at this<br>time this lecture f up over the next 8<br>weeks and uh you're all very welcome to<br>attend um the first two uh public<br>lectures this year are been given by<br>visitors to<br>chist and tonight it's my great pleasure<br>to introduce Professor Jonathan Davidson<br>who's going to talk about resilience in<br>everyday<br>life Dr davidon here a courtesy of the<br>Margaret black trust who had funded his<br>visit to Christ Church he was a keynot<br>speaker in a disasters conference at the<br>end of last week been giving other<br>addresses uh in the last few few days<br>and I think he's got another talk to do<br>after this evening before he returns to<br>America uh he trained in medicine in<br>England but then went to Scotland uh and<br>trained in Psychiatry but he spent most<br>of his career in North America and most<br>of the last few decades at G University<br>uh in North Carolina now he initially<br>got into this field of work um because<br>he's involved in uh examining veterans<br>who had come back from one war or<br>another with post-traumatic stress<br>disorder and that led to a wider range<br>of questions why do some people develop<br>postraumatic stress disorder and others<br>do not so tonight we're looking at the<br>positive side you what makes people<br>resilient in everyday life and it's my<br>great pleasure to ask uh Dr Davidson to<br>you<br>well thank you Peter um good evening<br>it's a pleasure to be here and thank you<br>all for coming out at the end of the<br>day's work uh to uh join me tonight in<br>this presentation uh my thanks also to<br>the black Family Trust for uh graciously<br>bringing me over here um as Peter said I<br>kind of got into resilience through<br>working with people that have<br>post-traumatic stress disorder and uh<br>looking to see what kinds of new<br>treatments might be helpful for such<br>individuals and for the last 15 years<br>I'd say um resilience became quite an<br>important um subject in my own career<br>tonight I would like to try to cover<br>some of the things that characterize<br>people who are resilient uh and uh some<br>of the benefits or the drawbacks that<br>associated with having resilience or not<br>having resilience<br>and then for a lot of the talk I thought<br>the best way to convey the important<br>points about resilience was actually to<br>describe uh individuals well-known<br>people in history to kind of dissect<br>them and analyze from a I guess<br>psychiatric point of view or a<br>resilience point of view what it was<br>about them that we can learn in terms of<br>resiliency so with that uh this is<br>actually the simple part of the talk to<br>Define resilience uh resil comes from<br>the word Sal to spring back to leap and<br>obviously resilience is bouncing back<br>after something has put you down an<br>adverse circumstance some kind of stress<br>a setback so the only way you can really<br>test a person's resilience is in the<br>adversity resilience indeed is present<br>in everybody I think that's an important<br>Point uh to make it's not like some<br>people are completely resilient and<br>other people don't have any resilience<br>everybody has some uh and uh one way to<br>illustrate this is if you take a major<br>Community<br>disaster like an earthquake or a flood<br>um or people who go into combat um or<br>even people who have individual traumas<br>only 10 to 15% will develop<br>post-traumatic stress disorder the uh<br>mobile human response to stress is to<br>somehow rather deal with it U<br>successfully and get on with life so<br>that is essentially resilience and it<br>has been described by one of the<br>Brazilian researchers as the as ordinary<br>magic that's a way to sort of describe<br>Brazilian it's it's ordinary because<br>it's everybody has it and it's you know<br>something that you see every day in<br>action but there's a magical quality<br>because it can um really be kind of<br>a um a a successful way to transform<br>somebody his life after Hurricane after<br>Katrina uh the hurricane uh that hit in<br>New<br>Orleans up to 80% of the community<br>reported that the experience left them<br>uh with a feeling of deeper purpose a<br>better ability to cope with stress and a<br>greater faith in their ability to<br>rebuild life so you sometimes hear the<br>term posttraumatic growth in a sense<br>this might be an illustration that as a<br>result of what people have gone through<br>they somehow or other identify aspects<br>themselves which they feel have left<br>stronger or uh empowered or<br>something if we were trees uh a good<br>tree to be would be the willow tree<br>because this is a resilient tree and uh<br>it's interesting that the wood to<br>describe the willow tree as salx another<br>a exper in the origins of land language<br>but salex sounds to me very much like<br>saleri so maybe there's a sense that<br>this is a resilient tree and that's my<br>is so cold uh just to um digress a<br>little bit um you may know that one of<br>the medicines that comes from the willow<br>tree is aspirin salic acid well there's<br>no more versatile or Brazilian medicine<br>and armentarium an aspirin that's been<br>around for 150 years has<br>SE several different<br>uses um let's just consider for a minute<br>uh<br>characteristics of resilient people and<br>essentially you can think of it as<br>characteristics within the person and<br>also because resiliency cannot be really<br>thought of in the absence of the<br>environment we live in uh then there's<br>also the issue of um connectedness to<br>other people so within the person um<br>it's helpful to be uh of an optimistic<br>disposition um to have uh a tendency to<br>experience positive feelings and and to<br>think positive thoughts and so you see<br>optimism uh Faith things will turn out<br>better even in bad times or even if you<br>don't understand things that eventually<br>it'll all become clear uh the ability to<br>experience human especially in adverse<br>circumstances to be enthusiastic and to<br>hold a level of curiosity about the<br>world within which we live taking<br>advantage and chances to learn new<br>things um a strong sense of self strong<br>belief in oneself and one's<br>capabilities and<br>resourcefulness uh flexibility uh the<br>um tendency to bounce back but also uh a<br>toughness hardiness when you break down<br>the concept of hardiness you're really<br>talking about commitment to something uh<br>the willingness to embrace a<br>challenge and the ability to feel a<br>certain sense of control the locus of<br>control is within<br>you there are actually scales on<br>instruments that measure hardiness that<br>was one of the scales that uh we used to<br>use a lot in our work and then many<br>times resilient people uh have a fairly<br>clear sense of right and wrong good and<br>bad and uh adhere to important guiding<br>principles in their<br>life so what about with respect to the<br>environment um the three things that<br>count here is the ability to have to<br>receive and to give but social support<br>is actually really important uh is one<br>of the biggest protective factors that<br>prevents you from getting post traumatic<br>stress disorder after a trauma uh<br>connectedness and also to be able to<br>engage in altruistic uh actions will be<br>to the benefit of other people uh<br>without you necessarily uh expecting to<br>benefiting<br>yourself so uh there are a lot of<br>ingredients in a sense it's simple to<br>Define resilience but when you think<br>about what goes into it there's a lot<br>that goes into it I'm going to spend<br>next students it's just to<br>summarize the relationship between<br>resilience and good health um I think<br>about four or five different<br>illustrations so we're not just talking<br>about an abstract notion we're talking<br>about something that indeed may be<br>associated with good or not so good<br>health here's a study uh it's called The<br>Well the N haes the National Health<br>nurses study I think in the US which is<br>a large population cover of several<br>thousand people and they have been<br>followed for a long time in this<br>particular case it was at the end of 15<br>years that the investigators reported a<br>relationship between what they call<br>emotional Vitality emotional Vitality is<br>if you like part of what goes into being<br>resilient you can see the definition as<br>they defined it positive energy the<br>ability to regulate emotion behavior and<br>uh being engaged and interested in life<br>people that had emotional vitality and<br>this was measured the Baseline and study<br>were Then followed up and the uh here<br>the relationship was examined between<br>being um full of emotional vitality and<br>uh whether or not we develop coronary<br>heart disease and there was a definite<br>protective uh influence among those with<br>high emotional Vitality against<br>developing coronary heart disease and<br>the the relative risk you see it says<br>0.81 what that means is there a 20%<br>lower chance<br>of developing coronary heart disease if<br>you have emotional Vitality versus the<br>chance of you have less emotional<br>vitality and uh as far as the<br>investigators were concerned they felt<br>this was something that was not related<br>to being depressed or not being<br>depressed it stood on its own but there<br>was this protective effect of emotional<br>vitality and they thought that one of<br>the things that it would lead to was a<br>general awareness of Health Health<br>behaviors and empowered attitude by the<br>individual to lead a lifestyle that was<br>kind of pro<br>health so here's another study the<br>protective effective resilience in<br>patients who actually have heart attacks<br>acute coronary syndromes and the the<br>result of this study was that the uh<br>severity of damage to the heart muscle<br>was directly related to the uh amount<br>well inversely related to the amount of<br>resilience so the more you were<br>resilient the less damage had actually<br>c among diabetics uh here's a um an<br>investigator in Texas Dr spineart Who<br>developed a four sessions package of<br>resiliency training and Stress<br>Management and disease management for<br>for diabetic patients and um she found<br>that uh the results of of Tak part of<br>these sessions led to reduced uh uh body<br>mass index uh better control of uh blood<br>sugar and also um positive changes in<br>cholesterol and blood<br>pressure so again cult in this case<br>cultivating resiliency by going into the<br>course of geop seem to lead to better<br>control of<br>diabetes among HIV positive<br>women this study by Dale showed that<br>that every increase by one point on the<br>resilience scale was associated with a<br>15% increased likelihood of being<br>adherent to antiviral medication so more<br>resilient people were just generally<br>more engaged in U participating in that<br>treatment um less resilient people would<br>be unpredictable they would not take<br>their medicines<br>regularly have HIV positive that's<br>pretty well uh determinative<br>outcome and the Dale concluded that<br>interventions that improve coping<br>strategies that promote resilience and<br>HIV positive women May achieve higher<br>antiviral<br>therapy levels and also greater<br>suppression of the viral counts which<br>here a large study in the US community<br>in San Diego a thousand or so El ERS<br>from the age of 50 upwards uh looked at<br>the question of what what does it take<br>to age successfully and this study by<br>Dill JY who one of the the great ger<br>psychiatrists in the US um found that<br>there were four predictors of successful<br>aging in the community one was<br>resilience you see this here uh the<br>estimate So-Cal is a sort of like the<br>size of the influence on uh predicting<br>successful aging so resilience uh level<br>of depression in the opposite direction<br>obviously the more depressed you are the<br>less successfully you age um physical<br>functioning on a scale called the sf36<br>so people who were in good physical<br>health and functional were more likely<br>to be successful ages and that age<br>itself so these four uh variables and<br>they include<br>that um I read<br>this resilience and depression and<br>significant associations with self-rated<br>successful aging with effects comparable<br>in size to that of physical health so um<br>so resilience clearly is something that<br>we can relate to health and health<br>diseases how can we increase resilience<br>is it changeable and how can we change<br>it so his p got some answers for us uh<br>Lucy's in the Consulting office here and<br>she's offering psychiatric health for<br>just 5 cents pretty good uh but<br>competition arrives and uh Snoopy<br>decides to put up his stand right Next<br>by next next door and um offers what's<br>called friendly advice instead of<br>psychiatric<br>help friendly advice in only two cents<br>so question is um you know of all all<br>the things that are being offered to<br>help build resilience is it friendly<br>advice the 2cent stuff or is at the<br>5cent stuff and for that matter how do<br>we actually judge whether these things<br>are<br>effective well there are many ways to<br>develop resiliency and one way of<br>thinking about it is a bottom up and a<br>top down approach by that I mean top<br>down would be you know you go to a<br>professionally qualified therapist and<br>you take part in whatever the therapy<br>package is cognitive babia therapy<br>acceptance and commitment therapy or you<br>know you can name it they all help in<br>one way or another or if you're<br>depressed and you're put on an<br>anti-depressant drug that too will build<br>a person's resilience so that would be<br>the sort of the top down you go to<br>somebody and you get Guidance the bottom<br>up is more what can I do for myself uh<br>and how how can I do it um in a way that<br>uh you know is manageable and uh<br>not U you know unreasonable so one of<br>them here is I've listed doing things in<br>I simp this earli already altruism it<br>helps people have found that quite a lot<br>when they look at the factors that<br>predict successful uh coping with stress<br>two Community work um which is in a way<br>form of<br>alism three um maintaining and building<br>social support so all of those things<br>are helpful uh<br>regular exercise is also important um<br>not just because it's good for you which<br>it is but it more than likely creates uh<br>patterns within the human physiology the<br>autonomic nervous system and the Brain<br>which uh results in Greater<br>resiliency and then don't underestimate<br>good sleep uh if if a person is<br>chronically lagging in sleep one of the<br>one of the consequences is that it's not<br>tone three simple brain exercises and<br>you know that could be anything from<br>learning to write with your non-dominant<br>hand uh to uh as it was suggested in a<br>book called neurobics by cats learn some<br>basic Braille go into the elevator<br>instead of pressing the regular floor<br>button you know number two floor use<br>your fingers close your eyes use your<br>fingers and impressive with using the<br>brail so you know you can come up with<br>as much creativity as you really want<br>here but any simple brain exercises and<br>simple behaviors which involve uh the uh<br>acquisition of new habits new skills<br>putting uh Pathways in the brain to work<br>that we tend not to use very much uh can<br>be all helpful building blocks they're<br>not dramatic but for building<br>blocks mindfulness meditation uh this<br>was on her off about 20 years ago I<br>remember when Kat Zin first went on the<br>you know Grand rounds and he started to<br>write about meditation mindful<br>meditation most people thought it was<br>like nothing much but it's uh it's<br>turned into a big movement in Psychology<br>and Psychiatry and it has pretty clear<br>clinical payoff helps helps a lot of<br>things mindfulness meditation can be<br>again something that a person might<br>cultivate themselves or they have a<br>choice they can go and seek out somebody<br>who comes workshops or offers it in the<br>context of uh various kinds of<br>psychotherapeutic packages so this is<br>another way to be<br>resilience actually I'm going to come<br>back to the mindfulness because there's<br>a very fascinating set of findings that<br>I would like to explain um people in the<br>workplace whether in the military um or<br>in a hospital medical center you name it<br>have developed um<br>packages which often address the<br>specific needs of of their employment so<br>if you're in the military in the US<br>there's a couple of things one's called<br>War Adventure Quest and ones called War<br>Ops uh the Mayo<br>Clinic developed a program called Stress<br>Management and resilience training which<br>they apply to their positions and offer<br>to other staff there as well um Outward<br>Bound could be it's not really an<br>employment or workplace course but it's<br>it's kind of coordinated packaging<br>activities can help build resilience um<br>Psychotherapy I've mentioned and then<br>other act other kinds of interventions<br>some anti-depressants can also so<br>there's a lot of ways that an individual<br>person can build resilience and a lot<br>depends on where you come from if you're<br>suffering from major depression and<br>you're in treatment that's one Happ even<br>you're probably going to have different<br>kinds of things often if you're not in<br>treatment at all and you're functioning<br>fairly well but want to work on stress<br>Management in resiliency and there are<br>some options there<br>too um temperament and Brazilian sence<br>is a factor uh you see this Photograph<br>here very nice picture of the island of<br>kawaii it's a lovely Place Spectacular<br>music and you wonder if there are ever<br>any problems on a place like Hawaii well<br>unfortunately there have been and U<br>Werner psychologist child psychologist<br>did a lot of fascinating work in the 19<br>70s 80s 90s following up rather like has<br>been done here in done Eden in Christ<br>Church following up large corts of<br>people for a long period of time she<br>took children who were mostly uh um<br>living in the plantations on the island<br>and followed them up and uh many of them<br>suffered from abuse and poverty and<br>parental alcoholism she found that uh<br>the ones who did best first off had a<br>certain temperament the the Sheep<br>described they had an easy temperament<br>they were kind of you<br>know not fractures and not uh um<br>problematic in their behaviors and uh<br>such people were able more easily to<br>elicit um care and responses from their<br>environment um and when she looked to<br>see what was it that helped people<br>growing up in that environment to become<br>resent she found one was having in<br>interests and hobbies that provided<br>solace in hard times so it's like having<br>a place to go where you there's a Haven<br>of Peace and creativity two is to again<br>take on a socially desirable task and<br>relationship um mindfulness um just make<br>a word comment about this Davidson this<br>not me it's Richard Davidson who's a<br>psychologist in Madison<br>Wisconsin uh has done done quite a lot<br>of work with mindfulness meditation at<br>one of his early studies he trained a<br>group of uh middle management Personnel<br>some place of employment in in the town<br>and they went through a course of<br>mindfulness and he did some um EEG<br>studies and SE studies before and after<br>treatment he found that the the ones uh<br>who had completed the course showed<br>changes in the prefrontal cortex brain<br>which uh generally are associated with a<br>positive aect positive emotional state<br>he also found that uh when these<br>individuals were given influenza vaccine<br>their antibody response was much more<br>robust so it's as if the course of<br>mindfulness meditation not only led to<br>positive emotional states but also<br>helped basically strengthen the immune<br>system<br>and as he put it in his paper changes of<br>this nature are associated with the<br>ability to recover rapidly from<br>stress so that's one there are other<br>studies too showing similar things with<br>mindfulness<br>meditation well getting back to peanuts<br>you know do these treatments actually<br>work are they worth 5 cents and here's a<br>uh review of different resiliency<br>training programs that P on go published<br>by the Mayo Clinic group same people<br>that develop the SN<br>program and um what you see here they<br>came up with about 13 studies that they<br>thought met their criteria and<br>um the what what you see on the right<br>here is basically the difference between<br>the effect of resilience of training and<br>going into a control group which is<br>either in this case nothing at all EX a<br>waiting list or in some cases they got<br>some other form of uh psychotherapy but<br>not the kind which is focusing on<br>resilience so with the total of all<br>these<br>studies they found out that uh water<br>here maneuver this there we are this is<br>what you can look at see the Black<br>Diamond here is to the right of the<br>middle line and this is telling us that<br>in agregate all of these interventions<br>are more successful and building<br>resilience than uh being in the control<br>group so they do make a<br>difference what uh lepen said though is<br>that a lot of these studies were not<br>very strong methodologically so the<br>confidence with which these uh<br>conclusions with drawn are<br>not strong I me it's like probably it<br>helps but there's a lot of work to be<br>point um it's interesting<br>uh that they did develop what they call<br>Smart Stress Management and resilience<br>training it is a one session module last<br>an hour and a<br>half and um then as part of it which go<br>to the next slide sure if you can see<br>this very easily but um part of it<br>involves training in brief structured<br>relaxation pce breathing meditation and<br>uh participants would t practice the<br>diap diaphragmatic breathing five<br>breaths per minute for 5 to 15 minutes<br>once or twice a day so they were given<br>some homework and throughout the course<br>of however long it went on uh they were<br>expected to put this into practice but<br>the initial module lasted 90 minutes so<br>it's not it's not very time<br>intensive and the result of<br>the course of smart shows print small<br>the print is very small but if you look<br>at the bottom here you see a measure of<br>resilience the Baseline and then week<br>eight an 8 week period uh they were<br>following people there was an increase<br>in resilience from 69 up to 79 which is<br>quite a substantial increase whereas in<br>the control group uh there was no change<br>at all<br>likewise the perceived stress was down<br>after the cost uh anxiety levels Smith<br>anxiety scale and then the overall qual<br>your life also improved so just this one<br>session M the smart for medical doctors<br>in the Mayo Clinic uh had some fairly<br>tangible payoff and I think that as we<br>consider professionals dealing uh<br>actually here these traumatized<br>professionals that was dealing with<br>everyday stress for for professionals<br>who are actually having to cope with<br>serious chronic and major trauma uh you<br>got to take care of yourself and uh uh<br>or you know your employers have an<br>obligation to make services available<br>they want to retain their stuff so<br>here's an example of um how it could be<br>done this slide uh says just because you<br>feel you recovered doesn't mean you<br>actually have recovered and this comes<br>up back to the question what do we<br>really mean when we Define resilience<br>and we say oh somebody's improved and<br>they're feeling better you can certainly<br>say well psychologically a person is<br>feeling better and their symptoms have<br>come down but that doesn't mean that<br>their bodies have recovered and here's a<br>um quite an instructive uh set of<br>results from a group of people who<br>survived a terror attack in the Oklahoma<br>City buning took place about 10 or 15<br>years ago it's a federal was a federal<br>building and a couple<br>of disgruntled individuals decided to<br>blow it up and they killed about 180<br>people um um so it was a serious event<br>and the Tucker group followed up the<br>cohort of survivors and also a control<br>group in the population that were not in<br>the building and she's followed them for<br>several years and what she found is that<br>even though the survivors of the attack<br>which is the red group<br>here survivors of terrorism were 60 here<br>uh even though they were recovered<br>psychologically they didn't have PTSD<br>anymore their symptoms had gone down a<br>whole lot what she found was that when<br>when they were talking about the event<br>their physiological arousal was so much<br>greater than in the controls to begin<br>with they started out before in uh<br>facing recalling the event they started<br>out with higher pulse rates so suggests<br>that their cardiovascular system had<br>been reset uh after the uh attacks and<br>had not come back down to E Line and<br>then it increased even more as they were<br>exposing themselves to the memory you<br>call in that day so here you had a<br>situation they didn't when they<br>recovered afterwards they still hav't<br>come down to the same level with the<br>control T so it does suggest that when<br>we consider the long-term consequences<br>of exposure to Serious trauma um we've<br>got to be aware of physical health as<br>well as psychological Health<br>particularly<br>cardiovascular<br>difficulties okay I'm going to go into<br>profiles I think I've left time to go<br>through everybody here we need to cut<br>out mon to that we can do that uh as I<br>noted earlier uh the only way you can<br>really evaluate resiliencies in the<br>context of some challenge or some<br>adversity so here we have um eight or<br>nine individuals that I picked out from<br>literature<br>um after as you can see certain events<br>in their life which uh<br>uh gave them um trauma and stress<br>and Challenge and uh childhood neglect<br>polio deafness slavery uh sinking of a<br>boat being in a concentration camp being<br>this targeted assassination attempt and<br>having to deal with paranoid<br>schizophrenia so um here we go what do<br>they teach us well this first person<br>everybody knows who he is Winston<br>Churchill um great example of Brazilians<br>uh and uh if anybody's interested in in<br>it Anthony store British psychiatrist<br>wrote a very insightful um essay which<br>he called Churchill's Black Dog well<br>what does the black dog represented<br>Churchill was uh uh vulnerable to<br>depressive illness I suspect you could<br>probably come up with a clinical<br>diagnosis you know if he had all the<br>information in front of you but for him<br>Depression was a real issue and uh got<br>it down and black he called it black dog<br>so first lesson here is that while you<br>can be a very resilient person you can<br>also be vulnerable to Serious Neal not<br>like if you have one you can't have the<br>other uh jur what Anthony store um noted<br>was that Church's courage was not rooted<br>in his genetics so it's clear that<br>genetics have some um role to play in<br>determining levels of resiliency but<br>it's not the whole story by any means<br>and according to story<br>Churchill was basically a person who<br>dedicated his his whole Personal Agenda<br>to find ways to build up his courage and<br>his<br>determination it was an act of will um<br>and he even uses the term resilience in<br>his essay yet Church's doggy<br>determination his resilience and his<br>courage enabled him until old age to<br>conquer his own inner enemy so there's<br>this theme if you look at all these<br>people there's this theme of doing<br>battle within yourself all these battles<br>are personal of course but uh it<br>involves having to overcome some kind of<br>inner<br>demon um interestingly when Church<br>became very old his brain started to not<br>function well he had Strokes he was a<br>heavy drinker he probably had chronic<br>depression and maybe even possibly<br>some elements of dementia and with all<br>of that going on it just really eroded<br>away his<br>resilience that's what story<br>until his old age he was able to conquer<br>the sin an<br>enemy uh some of Church of saying I<br>think tell us about what Brazilian is<br>success is the ability to go from one F<br>to another no lack of enthusiasm never<br>give in except the convictions of<br>honesty and good sense and this is the<br>Mantra of course for every therapist in<br>in the C of prolonged exposure and<br>cognitive therapy for fobic disorders<br>never turn your back back on the<br>threatened danger and run away from it<br>if you be it promply without flinching<br>you will reduce the danger by half so<br>you'll discover that is<br>way now the second case here is his<br>contemporary and colleague and friend<br>Franklin ruselt we know we tend to think<br>more of Franklin Roosevelt as the only<br>president who ever was elected at the<br>four terms of office in the US and for<br>his amazing um leadership during the era<br>of the depression then into World War II<br>uh but uh there's another side of his<br>life having to do with the polio that he<br>contracted when he was in his 30s and<br>John Gunther described him as um a man<br>with great capacity to withstand shocks<br>sorry uh withstand shocks made him seem<br>like he was made of a rber which is kind<br>of that quality of bouncing back and his<br>wife said the thing that took the<br>greatest courage in his life and she<br>uses the word courage too was his<br>Mastery y his meeting with polio and<br>what this led to was again a great um<br>illustration of post trumatic growth<br>going to Ellena Roosevelt Church<br>Roosevelt's nature underwent kind of<br>plowing up he became<br>warheart uh humble in spirit and people<br>became his vital Links of life and if<br>you look at his biography that is indeed<br>the case uh particularly with respect<br>polio he would uh do whatever he could<br>to make it for other polio sufferers to<br>join him in the swimming bars and The<br>Spar and stuff and then later on 1938 he<br>uh created uh the march of dying's<br>campaign as a systematic u means to<br>generate funding that could support<br>research uh causes in treatment polio<br>and well we know that the outcome of<br>that was was good and March of Dimes<br>today still exists but obviously it's G<br>very different but all of this you can<br>attribute pretty much to to Roosevelt's<br>uh dedication uh to be of service to<br>other people uh from his own experience<br>of polio can you imagine uh the age of<br>30 35 or whatever he was on The Fast<br>Track politically you know very<br>encouraging bright agenda L ahead of him<br>and then all of a sudden he's unable to<br>walk um so the dime the 10 cent coin<br>eventually<br>recognized his um U efforts and his<br>impact in this particular area and his<br>profile is now speak we seen on the back<br>of the<br>coin uh the March of Dimes and I said<br>continues a pace mainly is devoted to<br>looking for ways to better the health of<br>women in pregnancy and uh JS and health<br>problems B number three going back a<br>little bit in history but B<br>uh was um confronted again in his 30s<br>with the inevitability of increasing<br>deafness and you know can you imagine if<br>you're a musician and a performer going<br>deaf it's the last possible thing that<br>you would want and he had to come to<br>terms with this and he wrote what's<br>being called the hean stat<br>Testament hianat as a sub of Vienna<br>which is where he was at the time and in<br>this Testament he basically writes<br>honestly about where he's at in life and<br>he was had a terrible Place uh he felt<br>isolated angry he was uh humiliated and<br>fought seriously of suicide but one<br>thing held him back it seemed impossible<br>to leave the world before I had brought<br>forth all that I felt destined to bring<br>forth and so I modled along with his<br>wred life so there was one cause in his<br>life a greater cause um and he felt uh<br>like a sense of Destiny here I am I've<br>got this mission<br>and that's what kind of saw him through<br>and um the bottom part here of the slide<br>Central to his existence was the longing<br>to help mankind raise itself from<br>ignorance and pain so again this desire<br>to be help and good to the to the world<br>to other people uh this was from a book<br>by Aly s who wrote the 9th which is<br>about lat was n Symphony and it's<br>interesting because after he' gone<br>through this crisis Big Time stress be<br>like his music took on a whole new uh<br>character and SX put it alter across W<br>music Frederick Douglas is an next<br>person I'm not sure how well known he he<br>is to to this community but Frederick<br>Douglas was a leader in abolition of<br>slavery in the<br>US and he was born into slavery uh as<br>was often the case he was taken away his<br>father was removed when he was a young<br>infant and he was brought up by his<br>grandmother till he was seven at that<br>point he was taken away from his<br>grandmother by his owner he taught<br>himself to read at the age of 12<br>enslaved people were not allowed to read<br>the the whole fear of the white<br>plantation society was that by<br>empowering themselves with knowledge<br>they they would become a serious threat<br>and so therefore any efforts enslave<br>people to we were scrub<br>somehow he managed to do and at the age<br>of 13 he was leing leading Min meetings<br>you imagine the sort of prosity of such<br>a person that age being able to do that<br>uh and he knew that knowledge is the<br>pathway From Slavery to Freedom so<br>education knowledge<br>curiosity learn as much new information<br>as you can he was beaten by his own at<br>the age of 15 but he fought back he<br>wasn't taking it and then the beatings<br>ended uh and then at the age of 19 he<br>escaped and the rest of his life story<br>we we know well what became a he became<br>a leader an abolitionist social reformer<br>who was an amazing aror uh and uh he<br>wrote he wrote his autop at the age of<br>27 and you have to wonder if writing<br>your own biography or writing<br>autobiographically might be another way<br>to help uh creating<br>resiliency um anyway he<br>uh in his autobiography there were two<br>things I wanted to just mention one is<br>he refers to his natural<br>elasticity what this is saying is<br>resilience isn't just some New Concept<br>you know we've suddenly discovered for<br>the first time he knew all about<br>resiliency too he just didn't call it<br>that but elasticity that's what it is um<br>and then uh again getting back to the<br>issue of the moral compass and the uh<br>sense of right and wrong he said here I<br>would Unite with anyone to to do right<br>and with no one to do<br>wrong uh we'll move on to Margaret<br>mackworth White contest Ronda who was<br>the daughter of a liberal Member of<br>Parliament um she was on the Lucitania<br>and was one of the survivors and as a<br>result of what happened she felt her<br>life had been saved in order to give<br>additional purpose and Direction and she<br>became a leader for women's rights and<br>suffrage and it was largely due to her<br>efforts that eventually women were<br>accepted into the House of Lords she uh<br>after the Lucian<br>experience suffered recurring bad dreams<br>so she obviously had some post-traumatic<br>stress but at the same time the<br>realization that she had found the<br>strength to survive gave her new<br>self-confidence and interestingly this<br>is probably that any kind of<br>professional treatment she lost her fear<br>both of Wen and of<br>death Henry Crystal psychoanalyst<br>um he was<br>uh born in Eastern Europe and as a<br>result of the<br>Holocaust lost all of his immediate<br>family um he was uh taken away and moved<br>from one concentration camp to another<br>he actually spent three more than three<br>years in concentration camps performing<br>slave labor and right at the end of the<br>war just prior to liberation uh at which<br>time fortunately he was able to escape<br>from a convoy and was found by the<br>Allied troops but at that time he came<br>pretty close to dying and he said to<br>himself if I had to die nobody would<br>know nobody would miss me he eventually<br>uh he was able uh to get into medical<br>school in Germany and then later on he<br>came over to the United States<br>discovered he had a distant armed Liv in<br>Detroit made contact with her and came<br>over that's where he settled and he<br>became a leading figure in describing<br>and treating post-traumatic stress<br>especially related to concentration camp<br>experiences um and he uh a couple of<br>quotes from Henry Crystal which I think<br>are worth um taking away I feel that<br>healthy infantile omnipotence is the<br>most important acid in dealing with life<br>stresses and traumas um by which I guess<br>I understand that term to me like a<br>sense you can do anything there's<br>nothing that I can't do but with a<br>realiz but you know in reality of course<br>you can't do everything but you got to<br>believe you have this omnipotence at<br>some level and what would be your<br>message to Future Generations he says<br>the greatest power is love it gives us<br>resilience the power to survive and<br>eventually forgive and talking of<br>forgiveness I just spend 60 seconds on<br>some data from a study we did in the US<br>looking at the general population<br>especially focusing on people in the<br>community who' been exposed to malicious<br>trauma at the hands of somebody else<br>either violence sexual abuse or some<br>other damaging act and we asked them<br>among the questions did they forgive or<br>not forgive the person who perpetrated<br>the trauma and we found that the ones<br>who were forgivers ended up with higher<br>scores of resilience so they seem to be<br>more resilient and kind of fits in with<br>what Andre chrisal just said and it also<br>fits in with what the science is<br>starting to tell us you to really<br>understand forgiveness from a<br>neurobiological uh in within a<br>neurobiological framework um there are<br>certain Pathways in the brain um which I<br>just try to highlight um having to do<br>with one's neurologically represented<br>sense of self who you are and your<br>ability to put yourself in somebody<br>else's shoes<br>empathize um and then the prefrontal<br>cortex which is where one is concerned<br>more to deal with regul of thoughts and<br>emotions so these three areas I get the<br>mouse<br>to one two and three so triangular areas<br>that's where Stars we can see<br>forgiveness seems to be U represented in<br>the brain and what's interesting is<br>research uh has already found that<br>people that forgive tend to live longer<br>lives their well-being is generally<br>better they have lower rates of<br>cardiovascular disease and they also<br>don't do not ruminate as well in a sense<br>that's what forgiveness is it's quitting<br>ruminating ruminating is not a good<br>thing and it's one of the factors if you<br>are depressed prevents you from making a<br>thought recovery from<br>depression um am I doing all right on<br>time<br>pet yeah 15 minutes okay I'll give<br>myself another five minutes um Victor<br>Frankle um name probably many of you<br>uh recognize he also was a psychiatrist<br>and he also was a concentration camp<br>Survivor he was a bit older when he was<br>taken into concentration camp by that<br>time he was already a medically<br>qualified doctor and um amazingly in the<br>campus that he was at he conducted uh<br>like counseling sessions on Grief and<br>loss I think his experiences there<br>were very important in the way he<br>formulated his uh therapeutic approach<br>and and he came to the conclusion early<br>on that the perhaps the biggest need for<br>human beings is to find meaning and<br>purpose in life um it's not a a Pleasure<br>Principle of Freud or the power<br>principle of Adin but it's the search<br>for meaning he developed a form of<br>therapy called logo therapy um there's a<br>lot in logo therapy that is similar to<br>modern techniques of positive psychology<br>or wellbeing therapy<br>and here are a couple of um notice he<br>Liv pretty long life several of these<br>individuals I've picked out lived into<br>the 80s and the<br>90s um life is never made unbearable by<br>circumstances but only by lack of<br>Leaning hooks uh he also actually took a<br>quotation from n put in his book those<br>who have a wife to live conve almost any<br>how you say the same thing<br>too if something makes sense you can put<br>up with a law there's a reason for it<br>and then he says forces beyond your<br>control can take away everything and he<br>would know being in a concentration camp<br>except you have freedom to choose how<br>you will respond to the situation that<br>away Malala<br>um Malala is a great example of<br>resilience um she again unlike Frederick<br>dness showed incredible prosity and by<br>the age of 11 she was already starting<br>to speak out uh on behalf of the need to<br>educate women in her country and for<br>that the Taliban didn't like her and<br>they tried to assassinate her they<br>boarded a bus that she was on and they<br>asked where's Malana she she put her<br>hand up and uh obviously she was shot<br>and fortunately she she survived and at<br>the age of 17 she ear herself a Nobel<br>Peace Prize um<br>she has said uh of of her own<br>experiences here nothing changed my life<br>except weakness fear and hoplessness Di<br>strength further and courage were born<br>um and if we want to achieve our goal<br>then let us Empower ourselves with a<br>weapon of knowledge reminds me here of<br>FR dougas again um and she is she's a<br>person who has not being deterred by<br>setbacks strong sense of purpose has led<br>to further growth by her words<br>passionate commitment and holding fast<br>to a moral compass uh the last person uh<br>probably unheard of here Ralph Albert<br>blakelock he was an American landscape<br>painer and I I got interested in him in<br>a somewhat indirect way and ended up<br>writing this paper uh Ralph I'll try to<br>read this abstract because it kind of<br>captures why I decided to include it<br>Ralph blakelock was a leaning American<br>landscape painter much of his life was<br>lived in obscur and destitution he<br>developed late onset that's in his 40s<br>paranoid schizophrenia resulting in<br>prolonged hospitalization like 20 years<br>of G an asylum during the time in<br>hospital demand for his artistic Works<br>grew but he was unable to enjoy any of<br>the success uh instead the artist felt<br>prey to<br>unscrupulous exploitation by a<br>self-appointed guardian who basically<br>wanted to make money out of him and she<br>was aided and bettered by his<br>psychiatrists uh and it is more than<br>likely that this ter of events broke his<br>spirit and H denied he died in the age<br>of 72 having spent the last 20 plus<br>years in a psychiatric asum isolated<br>from the rest of the<br>world and is BL Lu um his paintings are<br>beautiful uh there's an exhibition about<br>to open in New York later this year and<br>the burst is putting it on says there's<br>so much I want to shared with you about<br>Blake Lo about the sheer force of<br>imagination and determination that he<br>said of course that forever changed<br>American art and he contended with<br>constant rejection and criticism uh he<br>was a rather naive trusting person and<br>unfortunately you know that's I think<br>why he was taking advantage of and he<br>never recovered from his insanity this<br>was he he painted beautiful<br>moonscapes um and uh in the hospital he<br>kept telling his doctor and his stuff<br>but he was an artist and people were you<br>know falling on backwards by his work<br>because he was learning about it and<br>they didn't believe him they said it was<br>all delusional to schizophrenia terrible<br>finally the head of the hospital<br>realized this was true and he started to<br>create this um pack with the woman who<br>was uh out to exploit him that's how<br>that all happened but in the hospital he<br>couldn't get a hold of any equipment to<br>paint material to paint so he ended up<br>painting on the back of shirts and cigar<br>boxes pieces of paper and he would make<br>the brushes out of his hair if he wanted<br>to get hold of paint the best he could<br>come up with was a bit of ink with some<br>tobacco juice you know what what<br>adversity for somebody who turned out to<br>be one of the greatest artists in his<br>generation and throughout all of that he<br>um he never lost his enthusiasm for<br>nature and for painting and in the<br>hospital this is one this is actually<br>his last work this is his doctor doing<br>round<br>those days he rode horse I guess when he<br>moved around the hospital and the house<br>in the background was the Doctor's house<br>where he was sometimes asked to go and<br>play the piano to entertain guests very<br>talented pianist so that's the story of<br>Blake loock and I think again<br>illustrates<br>Brazilians um so these I going say all<br>this you can see and read it this is<br>kind of summarizing what all of these<br>individuals certainly told me about<br>Brazilians um just on personal note to<br>finish up um like everybody else in this<br>room I was awakened the other night 3:30<br>in morning um frankly since I you know<br>I'm here on a short visit I wasn't<br>expecting to be actually an experience<br>at firstand of an earth Trav or an<br>earthquake and I was glad that nothing<br>further happened I felt a bit scared for<br>a while especially when you're half<br>awake you know and then I thought well<br>you know I'm going to go home and<br>everything will be fine but then I<br>thought a bit more about it and I<br>realized well I can't take it for<br>granted that everything will be fine<br>where I live either and if you look at<br>this map you know in the US everybody<br>thinks that earthquakes happen on the<br>west coast and hurricans happen here on<br>the East Coast you which they do by and<br>large and then typhoons I mean know<br>tornadoes and the floods happen where<br>all the rivers are in the Midwest and so<br>forth well guess what Charleston which<br>is my home down here on the east<br>Southeast coast in South Carolina um was<br>visited by a devastating earthquake in<br>1886 just after it had begun to recover<br>from the devastation of the Civil War<br>only 20 years later and this was a<br>serious earthquake it was considered to<br>be about seven on the RoR scale and 10<br>on the measurement of earthquake<br>intensity and there was a lot of damage<br>and it's not on a tectonic plate uh<br>problem it's it's within a plate that's<br>the issue nobody quite knows the<br>behavior very difficult to forecast<br>those kind of earthquakes there was a<br>lot of liquid faction because there's<br>lot of sand and sludge and stuff so the<br>damage was considerable and this was the<br>uh clevand newspaper reporting on terror<br>takes complete possession of the<br>inhabitants of Dooms Johnston this was<br>one of many pictures taken at the time<br>of the damage it see is considerable and<br>if you were to go to Charleston now<br>besides the fact that it has some<br>beautiful old homes the ones that<br>survived uh date back to the 1760s and<br>the lock of of them uh you notice these<br>little round structures in the house um<br>here for example these were earthquake<br>bolts put in after the earthquake to<br>strengthen the buildings so they would<br>go all the way across from the front<br>through the back to basically tie the<br>house together whether they would do any<br>good I don't know but there haven't been<br>any other earthquakes but we're still<br>getting Earth Tremors that much I do<br>know um so um it's some reassurance to<br>me I guess to know when I go back home<br>that our mayor recently uh put together<br>a plan basically to tax Property Owners<br>to raise some money in order to um<br>upgrade not only hurricane protection<br>because that's the real concern we have<br>but also I'm glad to see to protect<br>against earthquake damage and only two<br>or three years ago they in fact tore<br>down four Schools elementary schools<br>that were not built up to code and<br>replace them with the buildings which<br>are now considered to be up to<br>earthquake code so uh this fire engine<br>house this fireh house was built one<br>year after that earthquake in 1886 so<br>it's old it is still in use as you can<br>see it's just they don't have horse<br>drawn uh wagons coming out they have<br>real fire engines and um it's the oldest<br>station in the city so they they're<br>trying to figure out how to strengthen<br>all of those buildings too so it's<br>reassuring going back to the city that<br>is supposedly prepared that's not very<br>assured by the authorities anyway so uh<br>with that I will end and uh hope you<br>enjoyed the talk and I'll be happy to<br>comments we always to punish so that<br>people get away but there's time for<br>for yeah um in terms of trauma is there<br>any studies being done on parents whose<br>children have died in the parents whose<br>children have died uh under any<br>particular<br>circumstances<br>um I'm trying to<br>think in terms of resilience um there's<br>a lot of there are a lot of studies<br>going on I haven't really seen results<br>on them yet but there a lot of studies<br>going on with children who have what<br>illnesses that are likely to lead to to<br>death illnesses or chronic illnesses<br>from which they w't recover um there's<br>quite a lot of activity there but I I<br>results yeah you might be interested in<br>being told about how probably our best<br>nearly<br>what happened there uh she continued<br>writing and one supp<br>sto oh this was this was<br>she okay yeah well there was a time when<br>people uh in Mental Hospitals were<br>getting that genine most inappropriate<br>indications to schizophrenia so I wasn't<br>good my got she<br>wased yeah is it easy to teach young<br>children about resilience give them posi<br>things to<br>do well I think that one might be able<br>to take home some of the lessons from<br>the studies in Kaw with the children<br>although they were although they well<br>they were being studied as children as<br>they grew up and there were certain<br>things certain activities that did seem<br>to protect them from um poor coping um<br>getting involved D in socially<br>meaningful activities being one and<br>having cultivation of a hobby or some<br>kind of creative recrea recreational<br>helpful clearly support figures um a<br>caring Mentor for<br>asset you you didn't mention it but I<br>wondered about the role of an animal a<br>pit good point very good point and the<br>actually be right they're they're of<br>Great Value uh P therapy is uh is being<br>Incorporated uh in a number of different<br>contexts certainly veterans uh ass<br>Veterans Administration I with in the US<br>uh they're very well received and I did<br>a I was last few years where we visit<br>various VA centers to find out what they<br>were doing and that was one of the<br>activities that constantly was greatly<br>appreciated by both the staff and by the<br>patients pet therapy has a role in that<br>instance it's more to help people<br>recover from conditions like<br>post-traumatic stress but uh no reason<br>why it couldn't be helpful also for<br>creating uh some of the things that lead<br>exle I think we're at 8:00 or maybe one<br>last<br>question Cameron I'm an engineer<br>involved in the<br>rebuild a personal opinion please do you<br>think that knowledge of the hazard<br>knowledge of the risk will improve<br>resilience uh knowledge of the risk by<br>the general public or by individual to<br>know more about the threat of instance<br>great yeah I'm a great believer in<br>information and uh I think that as as a<br>consumer myself if you like or member<br>public<br>uh it's very helpful to know what status<br>of a particular building is if you you<br>be reassured that reasonable precautions<br>are taken<br>to prevent risks for example I think<br>that's very useful to know I don't know<br>there's any benefit to hide<br>it<br>okay now 8:00 we like to finish on time<br>and start on time so I ask you to thank<br>Dr<br>Davidson</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
