generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen for<br>those who don't know me I'm here choice<br>from the University hybrid Christchurch<br>every autumn we're up the series of<br>Public Health lectures on a whole<br>variety of products tonight's the second<br>in the series of a in tonight and make<br>wine director to reproduce a picnic so<br>so Petra Dennis vehicle would be in our<br>United States began his training as a<br>psychiatry of Pittsburgh but actually<br>completed it and prospect and he was on<br>the staff of the University of Otago<br>trust retrieval number of years before<br>he received an offer from America that<br>we could not match ah in so Patrick cart<br>return to not know how currently he is<br>to God's one at university of north<br>carolina wings professor was not hardly<br>in genetics but he also spends half of<br>the year in sweden at karolinska<br>institute we've also got research groups<br>a over the years since leave encashment<br>he's been incredibly prolific researcher<br>and the whole variety feels around<br>genetics and society and cause my<br>delightful and black pepper become<br>illegal baskets and returning it to the<br>bread thank you very thank you very much<br>it's a absolutelly to accurately it's<br>been about 22 years since I last stood<br>here giving talk I hope this little<br>better than last time is the last one<br>it goes well this is an image from I<br>think 1992 January some west coast beach<br>in the summer that's me with my son<br>Drebin obviously a few more gray hairs<br>now than before the one can appear to<br>mention is that my start in genetics<br>actually happened here and i was under<br>peter was i was a research registrar for<br>Peter in the early 90s and then started<br>his department and support from the HRC<br>actually make that happen I appear a<br>huge net really a lot of what I am as a<br>researcher began under his tutelage a<br>lot of the bad habits i have very<br>quickly got rid of and shirt certainly<br>helped me norm still on the way i also<br>like to thank mark kennedy who was<br>really the first person that I ever<br>started talking about whatever jennex<br>with and Martin proof incredibly patient<br>would answer my very very many stupid<br>questions over time okay today excuse me<br>genetics for parts of this big picture<br>of what we know what's coming what does<br>this mean the first two are part of the<br>update in the title of my talk the last<br>two are about agenda for the next five<br>yrs let's start with the big picture<br>schizophrenia lifetime prevalence around<br>one percent so about one percent of<br>people in a population densities of<br>radiation enforce their lifetime it's<br>characterized very briefly by persistent<br>delusions and hallucinations of unknown<br>cause I say persistent it's not just<br>having a bad day or a bad week it may be<br>is these six months of active illness<br>along with delusions hallucinations<br>which are very very far of the normal in<br>terms of its impact schizophrenia has a<br>massive impact on public health in terms<br>of morbidity which is sort of a non<br>definitely ways in which you don't<br>listen s-somebody up it always makes<br>among the top ten world in terms of<br>mortality actually death<br>people with schizophrenia tend to have<br>10 to 50 life expectancies 10 to 15<br>years less than average also especially<br>in industrials coming as massive<br>difference and then finally the personal<br>familial societal costs are enormous if<br>you want to put a number on it it comes<br>out of something like 1.4 million<br>dollars per person for life for elekton<br>so it's a huge huge process idle problem<br>now people have been scientists have<br>been looking at Steve leukemia for<br>100-plus years and every generation of<br>scientists has applied the best ideas<br>the best technologies on that they've<br>been able to do and things that work<br>really really well in many other areas<br>of Medicine have not really worked well<br>Christie's a premium so the typical<br>methods graph technology from fetish<br>disease or neuropathology and send them<br>settle every generation of scientists<br>trying to crack this nut and it's been<br>very very difficult to do I think the<br>very start that I would point out that<br>what are things about schizophrenia<br>that's crucial to keep in mind is that<br>it probably is due to a fairly subtle<br>classes moved many people schizophrenia<br>actually develop normally for a couple<br>decades and then even before we invest<br>into disorder give you attended quail<br>and then they tend to get better after<br>period of time they had a sort of waxing<br>leading horse but even people were at<br>their most the basic neurological<br>functions intact basic cognition was<br>taxed censorious attack etc it wasn't as<br>if once illness began there was this<br>rapid in actual decline to coma seizures<br>and death and so I learned that food<br>beginnings of a clinical perspective in<br>subtle processes like I'm in terms of<br>genetics this is actually emerged as a<br>major clue from a couple of generations<br>of scientific study but the key thing is<br>that the genetic factors are<br>deterministic their publicity so we're<br>not talking about something like it when<br>people hear about genetics they think I<br>if I have that then I'm going to get<br>some outcome it's not that people who<br>are high risk for schizophrenia for<br>whatever reason that there is subtle<br>increasing that's rather than something<br>that's marked the risk might go one<br>percent to something higher that never<br>have essentially zero or ten percent to<br>essentially understood so family this<br>people with an initiative is a female or<br>a person with schizophrenia if you look<br>older or any relatives there those<br>relatives are ten times more likely<br>testis agree but that's a relativist the<br>absolutist bill is far far less than<br>that so if the lifetime risk is one<br>percent the family costs are around her<br>personal schizophrenia you know maybe<br>their risk is something like an eight<br>nine ten percent so again that implies<br>that most people to family is just is a<br>premium simply don't get themselves and<br>then twin set up look at this for a long<br>time and even when one identical twin<br>disc is between the risk of the coachman<br>is only about fifty percent so again<br>clearly there's more than just a genetic<br>factor and we've looked for a long time<br>and they're really dope and no single<br>team crosses and again and I would argue<br>this is consistent with a rather subtle<br>subtle biological process so when we<br>given them to net Ock's is however a<br>reasonable clue into etiology<br>schizophrenia and even that most other<br>things haven't worked very well ok why<br>would we do that what wisdom point were<br>the goals I would argue that they're<br>essentially of two major reasons to do I<br>like the sort of primary secondary and<br>tertiary prevention hi my intervention<br>is when you try to prevent a case from<br>happening in the first place can we do<br>something to stop this between your<br>develop secondary prevention is when a<br>case is for when somebody has an on-set<br>to minimize time from developing disease<br>that's not really a genetic problem that<br>really is more attitude with treatment<br>services detection so but your share<br>dimension is certain it's nothing the<br>genetic health you know can we use<br>genetic knowledge to tell us figure out<br>better therapies particular people and<br>for the primary tertiary editors a<br>really good or really precise knowledge<br>of the biologies is it really is<br>absolutely essential and that's the<br>thing with genetics to deliver now going<br>back about nine years right now the<br>field is like Linux is pretty much stuck<br>we had all kinds of huge problems you<br>know there were various certain<br>diagnostic markers we did not know you<br>know it's excuse me is not like many<br>other areas of Medicine we have<br>objective tests to say yes the disease<br>is present or no its absolute or its<br>present and this is how much one has we<br>don't have anything the diagnostic<br>process is something which we know is<br>those reliable solutions and degree but<br>don't have access yet to any fundamental<br>allergy to tell us whether this person<br>does or does not has his agreement in<br>addition the genetic architecture number<br>of genes that the effect sizes were<br>common they were what we're looking for<br>it's completely enough we only had a<br>salute guests existing with envy there<br>was also the fact that you know<br>presumably if we have a underneath is a<br>premium it may not I hope they may not<br>all have the same room list and maybe<br>several different Isis's opinio embedded<br>in that and we did we don't know any we<br>did not get any ideas to what that was<br>in addition a lot of spice that happen<br>before would look at a few markers in<br>one gene and not and miss the vast<br>majority of genetic variation in the<br>genome the sample size that will really<br>really small often and there were<br>certainly worries about publication bias<br>and all sorts of other problems frankly<br>the fables kind of mess and so then we<br>applied this was something I've learned<br>when I was here this is of course<br>numbering where we sort of applied to<br>interpret in the bowl whose English<br>approach which is to source it back<br>insane right if it's broke economy fix<br>it and we form something called the<br>Psychiatric Journal to sourcing so this<br>began back in two thousand seven we<br>assumed that the sample size racks cute<br>and then there's no single group ever<br>under any circumstances actually get the<br>kind of numbers that we therefore we<br>need to have new model signs we need to<br>figure hi collaborate in an altruistic<br>way either call the structure is<br>democratic and David rabbited by<br>transparent and we have basically get<br>people hating each other on the same<br>token if it's an I know each other so we<br>actually have to get things together and<br>make it harmonized and i'll talk more<br>about that okay so that's the big<br>picture what do we know us is a premium<br>circa 2016 so the first thing that I've<br>moved three different types of genetic<br>variation the first has to do with the<br>excellent the SL was our fancy term for<br>the parts of our DNA so each of us adds<br>something like six billion bases is that<br>Americanism I forget to this is at six<br>so six thousand million bases okay six<br>followed by many zeros however that<br>translate<br>ki isms in terms of those numbers and<br>only about 1% of that actually makes a<br>protein the rest is a lot of other<br>complicating some parts 29 some parts<br>that very very important functions<br>necessary proteins so one percent of the<br>GM makes in 20,000 basic proteins that<br>we all need in order to function live<br>develop and be human basically and<br>exhale sequencing is the way in which<br>you actually target that one to three<br>percent of human genome and understand<br>exactly what's going on there this<br>really is in the sweet spot for human<br>genetics so when you think about typical<br>genetics you know breast cancer and gene<br>brca1 if you think about Huntington's<br>disease cystic fibrosis it said all the<br>genes you think about when you think<br>about huge next this is the technology<br>or various this technology from what<br>I've been used in order to actually<br>identify those so typically what this<br>find our own things that are really<br>really where you no way ever understood<br>1001 to 2500 even less sometimes but<br>they have a very strong impact because<br>they tend to kill repeat and this<br>technology's been applied in<br>schizophrenia there have been three<br>small published papers two large long<br>look at 617 parent affected offspring<br>trios another one looked at 25 on cases<br>with schizophrenia 2500 controls one to<br>use count as being rigorously<br>significant the gene set d1 hey and what<br>this team does is it it it it's a<br>histone meter and essentially what it<br>does is there's another part of the way<br>which DNA coils on itself and those<br>little coils have sex or on language<br>and that language is quite complicated<br>not completely understood and this gene<br>is involved in that process and that's<br>something that's going to be published<br>full 21 papers impress other things that<br>have popped out our besides that no<br>other single genes have come up these<br>studies should have been well power to<br>find them if they really were there but<br>the things that are come consistently<br>have to do with neuronal signaling for<br>calcium things that are at the synapse<br>the part of the when tuners talk to each<br>other there's a little physical gap<br>that's called a synapse and messages<br>transmitted across there and things that<br>are evolved on both side of that<br>actually coming up very consistently to<br>be important to the best of our<br>knowledge though there are no single<br>gene really strong effect immediately<br>disorders there's nothing like<br>Huntington's disease we've been able to<br>find for schizophrenia in analysis<br>behind the scenes there's something like<br>10,000 cases and another 1,800 trios<br>much much larger than initial samples<br>and frankly these things continue to<br>sing back maybe one gene has popped up<br>and a bunch of interesting pathways but<br>again nothing to indicate that there's<br>to be very quick answer in this Barbra<br>Jean now usually there's something no<br>temperature variation called copy of<br>radiation use moving here 2001 for mom<br>14 dad hg sometimes however do some<br>things to people that need that are<br>quite interesting the number of hours to<br>change you can only inherit one cop<br>because one of your parents didn't have<br>a particular gene or that one pair of<br>I've had several powers and you might<br>hear three columns and this is called<br>copy of variation<br>so getting to you tend to have fewer or<br>more Wow and these are actually quite<br>interesting because Egypt things that<br>are really quite rare so typically if we<br>look at one of these might be found in<br>three people with schizophrenia out of a<br>thousand that very many many fewer will<br>be found in people without system<br>controls and yet the risk actually is<br>markedly increased so these these are<br>rare things that increase the risk of<br>schizophrenia somewhere before in<br>between old and in fact I think if you<br>were to look at all of the things<br>because about 10 of them that are known<br>right now you would actually find that<br>people seem mean you probably have one<br>to three percent of people who actually<br>calendars and this might be something<br>which might actually end up being<br>important there's a paper that's going<br>to be submitted soon where we look at<br>30,000 cases was physically and again<br>the same pattern originals but the one<br>thing the Casa is common variation so<br>these are things where the jetta various<br>platonic most of us have some of these<br>men just have many of these and we 19<br>houses so these are things that are<br>common in population there are many of<br>them that they have pretty subtle effect<br>priests often I'll stop with that a<br>second this was a paper published a bit<br>less than two years ago in Asia and had<br>created two offers one of my friends was<br>the person that had typed in all three<br>hundred and two names about 12 hours<br>into the process he said that well no<br>idea what would email was just a death<br>and then we found that we didn't have to<br>do it today but in this large consortium<br>talk about the site to Nova Scotia with<br>PVC we were able to pull together around<br>37 thousand cases and 113,000 controls<br>this was truly a global level this mean<br>this was at something like there were 50<br>52 different samples were actually<br>involved from all and in the end we<br>found that we've had 108 places in the<br>genome 108 independent regions which<br>actually a genetic variation which<br>predisposes give premium this increased<br>the prior hold by a factor of five which<br>was a paper that I did and so basically<br>this was markedly a huge net forward for<br>our field and what one of these things<br>actually one of the genes that became<br>involved well one of the ones that was<br>the most interesting was dear to dr v 2<br>is my code genetic code for the dopamine<br>receptor 10-2 so this is this is a gene<br>which bind instead the synapse the place<br>it's where nerves go from that<br>information was one herself in the next<br>and it bombed don't as it turns out this<br>exact protein drd2 is the target for all<br>effectiveness and odds and so this is<br>sort of really interesting that really<br>sort of interesting synergy where the<br>protein the Gina makes the protein we're<br>all affected antipsychotics work there's<br>also a popular see things that are gold<br>and I'm da receptors multiple things<br>popped up these different genes the<br>proteins actually touch them do things<br>together the same your castle signaling<br>these two genes the names don't matter<br>they actually are part of a really<br>important way in which nerve cells<br>function has to do with calcium going in<br>and out of the cell this particular gene<br>makes approaching which is the whole the<br>calcium goes through and this guy is<br>actually<br>actually touches these they physically<br>actually religion to their function so<br>yeah that we're getting these things<br>that we know follow the same pathway of<br>the same idea I think it's a pretty<br>important ality right now there are<br>60,000 cases in total so the study<br>published its 37,000 there's 60,000<br>right now that woman Halston up and this<br>has increased the number of associations<br>by 50 more so now there's about 60<br>associations letters and that as it<br>turns out where we are right now every<br>time we get 1,000 cases we give for more<br>substitutions and that relationship is<br>held for about three years okay so what<br>do we know what's good for you first the<br>genetic architecture is my short him<br>okay how did nature this how to make<br>sure give miss Christy supreme how many<br>teams how common are the number of genes<br>are problem environments how common most<br>are actually like I'm you are common or<br>rare and confer large screens brisk the<br>effect sizes are mostly week odds ratios<br>of 1.1 if you are actually quite<br>stronger odds ratios of 4 to 20 now but<br>I say 1.1 unexplained that that's that's<br>a relative risk so essentially this<br>means is having that variant increases<br>your risk of ischemia by ten percent if<br>the rays get opinion is one percent ten<br>percent of that is the point one so<br>having a variant will increase your risk<br>from one were sent to one point one<br>percent so the absolute list is really<br>really small but the relative risk is<br>how to see okay so this is a critical<br>thing this is a pretty mean effect you<br>know whereas there other ones so some of<br>the some of the stronger ones yeah you<br>would find in three-point-three percent<br>3,000 cases<br>essentially no controls for very very<br>few controls and that course means it's<br>rare at this time how do they act they<br>tend to act Adamle rather than any other<br>way this is again the genetic fine print<br>one of the things that people are<br>wondering about is do we find genes<br>interacting genes genes interacting with<br>environment then these relationships are<br>suspected but they certainly are not<br>true despite their good okay what's<br>common this is getting an agenda so when<br>we talk about common variation again the<br>whole notion here is that a precise<br>understanding of the genetic factors<br>environmental factors how they interact<br>and what they tell us about the biology<br>are really critical to prevent him<br>schizophrenia the first place primary<br>prevention and tertiary prevention<br>coming up with better therapies and the<br>second source from this big thing that<br>we started in 2007 again thought it was<br>a really safe bet that the sample size<br>huge too large pregnancy the group we<br>need to cooperate if you go to the<br>website here we G see that UNCW you can<br>actually find out a lot about the PGC we<br>set it up so that the results of our<br>studies can be downloaded last single<br>click and so it's when we encourage<br>people to use this we know that that<br>these data have been at least 125<br>publications and that's the kind of<br>thing that we encourage and he sort of<br>responsible sensible use with this we<br>want people to do so that we can learn<br>as much as possible if that two Rams so<br>far we just got a really nice cold and<br>third one in there should be funded it<br>at any time and this is going to really<br>fun and push the agenda that i mentioned<br>so pgc currently has only subscribe to<br>go fast so i chair the coordinating me I<br>am your prototypical capper whereas<br>going dutch ovens likes<br>say my job is to keep the frogs in the<br>wheelbarrow which is which essentially<br>means i describe tummy is it's really<br>quite boring sometimes but it out of the<br>PGC currently has 903 scientists so we I<br>think right now we have something like I<br>think people from 45 different countries<br>and well over two other institutions<br>really it's truly a global network we<br>have nine working groups attention<br>deficit hyperactivity disorder anorexia<br>nervosa autism substance use disorders<br>bipolar disorder major depression OCD<br>Tourette's posttraumatic stress and<br>schizophrenia in addition this crossword<br>group where we try to understand okay<br>what are the things that make these<br>disorders similar versus different<br>there's a copy of a very group and then<br>of course visitor keys discipline houses<br>group which is sort of the back<br>honorable or we've got our visual<br>Alzheimer's group as well but you know<br>one of the key things of courses that<br>settles orders don't really true<br>comorbidities universe if a person has<br>one second yes or if they often have<br>another very informed and<br>well-intentioned clinicians can have<br>very long debates as to whether that<br>patient has schizophrenia or whether the<br>enviable restless i got features this is<br>something which is which is known issue<br>in psychiatry where comorbidity is<br>service or the key feature and it has a<br>lot of implications for how we diagnose<br>people how we step example and what<br>other things we're finding is that the<br>genetic basis of lisa stores is not pure<br>they tend to sort of overlap its and<br>very complicated ways and that winner is<br>little been seeing amazon's<br>where if the people with schizophrenia<br>they can have more relatives of I<br>holders to the schizophrenia but also<br>the bipolar disorder and depression and<br>so it really kind of runs together in<br>some complicated ways and this is where<br>we are right now in terms of the sample<br>sizes in the PGC so these are the number<br>of thousands of cases 10,000 20,000 etc<br>I've listed the nine disorders ADHD<br>indirectly etc here's his cranium<br>substance use disorders and what we're<br>seeing is this this this smaller bottom<br>lightest color was in the first wave<br>horsemen 2009-2011 this was sort of an<br>immediate second wave 2 2011 to 2013<br>this this is the current sample size and<br>this is our projected sample size what<br>we think we're going to get in about<br>three four years so we initially started<br>with about 30,000 to old cases extend<br>114,000 and we should have about half a<br>million my goal for all groups in the<br>PGC is for each phuket about a thousand<br>cases and it looks very strong that<br>these are the asteroid sample sizes<br>right now major depression is very<br>likely to get there is immediate and get<br>their host max stress disorder just<br>landed billionaire and so I think<br>they're going to two and the orange bars<br>here are showing the group that actually<br>have multiple genome-wide significant<br>multiple hits multiple associations for<br>this or make an impression is not and<br>that's something that will just run and<br>I mentioned that my colleague is bright<br>160 / schizophrenia bipolar is 21 plus<br>at cemetery so it's really starting to<br>because we're finally getting the past<br>sample sizes them and then this search<br>shows the relationship between the<br>number of cases and the number of mine<br>and so this is inflammatory bowel<br>disease and they have every engine in a<br>Model just realized society there are a<br>lot of things that will give you bloody<br>diarrhea except from limb paralysis and<br>so there aren't a lot of copies of pina<br>comas than they have you can make it<br>relatively precise diagnosis because<br>most countries people by actually and<br>you can certainly tell what a person has<br>and their architecture was very<br>favorable they got to about hundred<br>findings with only around 5,000 cases so<br>that was because the architecture of Ed<br>was very favorable for this now in most<br>other situations you basically survival<br>disorder you see that nothing happens<br>while and it turns a corner and then<br>starts to increase for schizophrenia and<br>this is including a published data that<br>partial analysis along the way we didn't<br>find anything till about 2,000 story we<br>didn't have anything until about six<br>thousand cases and then it really<br>started to climb and this is what the<br>people that study hi come to so it's a<br>little to be typical thing that these<br>common disorders are characterized by a<br>lot of the main thing there are a lot of<br>common variants very subtle effect you<br>need very big sample sizes different so<br>what is this off and and so we've got a<br>number of cases number of associations<br>and you have an initial area we're not<br>and then people right with you papers<br>and tell you what you're doing this<br>stupid occasionally you know if your<br>architecture is very favorable they'll<br>take off of their smaller cases but<br>that's a typical there's a planet<br>reflection with things starting off you<br>start to get one and six<br>to better than it actually does linear<br>so like this gives alenia every time the<br>advowson cases we get for more that's<br>the story eventually it will tail off<br>when we get close to the true number of<br>associations it will offer because there<br>aren't an infinite number of places in<br>the default is greener and I was naked<br>to a point of diminishing returns where<br>have increased things we find out a lot<br>of effort to increase if you don't find<br>out how much but we don't need to get<br>here we just need to get there we need<br>to get to a point with words good enough<br>where we tag most genes at least once<br>but we've actually identified most of<br>the pathways you know eighty percent of<br>the time that's working together and<br>that is an accomplishment and frankly<br>this is actually kind of market or<br>mental so I think we actually know what<br>doing you can actually find what is the<br>kind of study you to do in excellent<br>estimates as to what the sample size is<br>and that's really amazing for us because<br>after having wandering around and not<br>really know what we're doing to try lata<br>through things frustrated it's amazing<br>that they actually have a bath okay so I<br>think in terms of each other the first<br>goal is to complete the parts list we<br>need to find as must about the<br>architecture as we can how many genes<br>there are how hard they are what effect<br>sizes this will be the thing that will<br>tell us the loyalty there's plenty of<br>examples of the genetic variation points<br>to achieve and the various others at all<br>the that G is actually really credible<br>for drunk driving so the so for example<br>the HDL receptor actually for example of<br>this it actually has livid it actually<br>has a genome-wide significant<br>association that's very common it's not<br>very large it's not very the effect size<br>is not huge but get that obviously is<br>your critical target for drug<br>development and so the drug complex our<br>stuff<br>a lot of attention and so this is<br>actually key step triple primary inertia<br>prevention so why does that get us<br>orders overlap and this is a shot I'm<br>Brendan with his st. Andrews you haha<br>gives a new interns and he got a cattle<br>there there and he actually went on the<br>study mathematics and he actually not to<br>develop a tea method that were using<br>right now he dealt with animals to ask<br>some software for women to actually make<br>is called aggression and what it allows<br>you to do it allows you to take the<br>genetic results and look at correlations<br>between two different disorders and so<br>so instead of looking at like a<br>phenotypic correlation like just looking<br>at you know if you study a thousand<br>cases and a thousand controls how often<br>they have those disorders you can<br>actually look at DNA and look at the<br>results of Athena and ask the questions<br>from a genetic perspective how similar<br>versus different are these two scores<br>and when i'm showing here is is what<br>this is from paper that's going to be<br>submitted soon where they looked at<br>where we both have about 40 different<br>neurological and psychiatric sores and<br>this is when you get a neurology so you<br>know most of the things the things to<br>look for our blue colored squares with a<br>master key because those are the ones<br>that are significant you find that my<br>terrain my aura in my room for lor tend<br>to be higher quarterly different<br>subjects of stroke different types of<br>that us but if you look at all the other<br>ones there are not a lot of different<br>correlations so to go find my regular<br>laughing with multiple sclerosis from<br>with Alzheimer's and the reason this is<br>important is this is what happens when<br>you actually can diagnose them<br>relatively clean finger your neurology<br>is a much better perspective we are in<br>terms of coming up with diagnosis but if<br>you look at the psychiatric sorters<br>they're reviewing and this is a lot of<br>correlations and so for example will<br>take is one of the times is premiums<br>correlative thinner actually bosa<br>d the fiefcorp disorder ADHD and<br>depression and it's not associated with<br>these two guys because their sample size<br>of juice if we look at bipolar disorder<br>similarly it's highly correlated with a<br>lot of different things and this is this<br>is one of the key problems in the piano<br>psychiatry is that the genetic basis you<br>know we know that confidence is<br>everywhere we know the diagnostic<br>precision could be improved and now<br>we're finding is that the genetic<br>correlations are wheeling the time and<br>there's a common things within Europe<br>which are actually really quite<br>intriguing which are first positive<br>genetic correlation of interaction<br>boasted with obsessive-compulsive<br>principle which kind of makes sense i<br>mean people with and you can clearly do<br>have a lot of obsession alanine a lot of<br>things but the two that i point out to<br>you is the correlation between<br>schizophrenia and anorexia in<br>schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive<br>disorder this is important because<br>people with these two disorders do 10<br>thoughts will use the perceptions which<br>we we are not in tune with the reality<br>that the people experience in typically<br>we label those people were valuing ideas<br>but we rarely a thought that they<br>actually were truly of the indices<br>between you and I would are that these<br>data suggest we need to go back when we<br>visit assumptions so so this is<br>something which i think it is really<br>kind of it is something we're looking at<br>really carefully I think it's something<br>that will help us understand more about<br>the fundamental ways in which the<br>classic recipe energy source okay rare<br>variation so these are some rare<br>variants are things that are quite rare<br>the population that they have strong<br>effect now I've said already this is<br>between is mostly as a common very<br>disorder what I really should have said<br>is that it's mostly a contrary disorder<br>that there may be a way to find single<br>genes a strong effect this is important<br>because this is a sweet spot your<br>biology there's a ton if you actually<br>have a clear connection between<br>schizophrenia<br>there's a ton of different things you<br>can do almost immediately and your<br>science lab but as to what a lot of<br>people are a lot of those are doing it<br>just going to be large and in fact due<br>to power calculations carefully you find<br>that the sample sizes you need to review<br>Mars 50,000 maybe 100,000 cases<br>especially truck to begin to identify<br>stuff but the question forces can be new<br>things number eight water wise that are<br>sort of smaller tonight here's one<br>family that that we came across with Joe<br>kid who's autism researcher and even see<br>and he came across this some sperm donor<br>and the sperm donor sperm has been used<br>something like 80 times in the States<br>and the risk of autism portunities is<br>children is something when they order of<br>about third person we were able to find<br>seven pairs of moms and effective male<br>offspring and we've actually put them<br>through a lot of stuff I absolutely<br>angle is causing it I need to wait for a<br>long verification stuff but it looks<br>like this might actually be a single<br>gene a heat past my arms these eight<br>male offspring that might actually have<br>it give them stronger system so again<br>this to do this this experiment is only<br>about twenty thousand dollars not the<br>tens of millions that didn't sequencing<br>the amount of thousands actually<br>possible I'm getting we're doing that to<br>think it's kind of cool is we found a<br>way to find the sickest of the city so<br>there's still a state hospital system in<br>states where they've got a thousand<br>people who have highly<br>treatment-resistant psychosis the first<br>person in the study was hospitalized for<br>everyone and we've got some we've got a<br>hundred samples already and we're<br>actually getting whole genome sequencing<br>them three really a typical for people<br>and here's one example a four day old<br>man who was diagnosed with schizophrenia<br>21 and now aged 14 basically to the<br>continent incoherent mute<br>just kind of all and obviously subpoena<br>that's incredibly smart to deterioration<br>and so obviously were throwing your<br>canvas kind of time next to turn the<br>agenda is we've got a project called Sun<br>and the basic idea there is as I<br>mentioned there you know if in fact<br>there are hundreds of hundreds of genes<br>involved in schizophrenia how do I mean<br>what was going on there and our<br>estimation is that is probably a network<br>that there's one or several biological<br>pathways each comprised dozens of<br>different genes and the what's happened<br>is Miss regulation so it's not realize<br>now that changes in the protein itself<br>its changes mount and how we respond to<br>development whether the right amounts<br>made the right time yes or no and this<br>is something that we're actually<br>pursuing biography but this requires a<br>lot of different expertise and so I'm<br>working closely I also to pull together<br>sort of a network of about a dozen<br>different labs This Is Fundamental<br>Research Council and I'll go into detail<br>essentially we've got a way to look at<br>proteomics individual moms so we can<br>actually look at proteins and local to<br>target one protein and then look at all<br>the proteins that interact with and then<br>that way to try to stand out on network<br>one of my colleagues has this technology<br>also Owens where 96 before you will<br>format we can actually disrupt in<br>neurons we can disrupt your one gene two<br>genes through jeans full sets of genes<br>we can actually knock out a post and<br>then actually mention about who need<br>four parameters on what's happening in<br>our it if we actually if we actually<br>have something that's you know really go<br>on so this is a hike up your tech this<br>is a much lower flu technology<br>essentially what Mike on we can do is<br>inner self and the axons are labeled in<br>our mortgage calc is actually bed that's<br>another school here all the synapses are<br>here green he can actually go in and do<br>single supporting just a ton of synaptic<br>biology and we can change things so we<br>can actually knock down jeans / express<br>jeans and see what happens within this<br>very well-defined constructs and so this<br>is the kind of thing that we need to do<br>as well so in addition to help to find<br>the genetic findings I think we really<br>need to sort of cloud widely but to do<br>the downstream biology even requires a<br>lot of require many many other<br>technologies as well this is something<br>that we just started on the half ago<br>this is a European Union project called<br>Coulson and I was able to pull together<br>eight academic labs plus two companies<br>Roshan limbeck in Europe and the whole<br>bowl of this project is to find an<br>effective treatment for one person and<br>so we're beginning with individuals who<br>have who have either two of these<br>disorders intellectual disability autism<br>schizophrenia we also have to have to<br>have what is clearly sort of causal<br>somehow mutation and synaptic proteins<br>and proteins at the the place to get<br>nurse come together now there's a bit of<br>magic here it was more about this than<br>the next slide we can take a sample<br>right now of any divisible cell in your<br>body blood skin cell you plop hair color<br>pairs of the root p into a cop there's<br>still visible cells there if you we<br>didn't get a cell that you divide we can<br>make that into a stem cell and then we<br>make that step<br>so this is the whole I can see induced<br>pluripotent stem cell technology and<br>that's what we're doing so we're going<br>to find an individual we will make their<br>arms follow that person will distribute<br>them to eight different labs academic<br>labs that are working here they're all<br>synaptic labs they will all work<br>together and figure out what's going on<br>and then the drug companies will if<br>we're successful in finding the<br>pathology the drug Iraqis will be able<br>to take that model and screened against<br>you know 10,000 condoms and the ultimate<br>goal is is to eventually repurpose<br>existing drug so ideally over the timing<br>is we today right we can show in dish<br>for you this drug has potential benefit<br>because it snappy that you have is<br>reversible and then we propose basically<br>an on trial for that person so again<br>this is precision medicine but the<br>ultimate pool is can't even help one<br>person and it's like my feet hold of<br>course this part a friend of mine debe<br>vivir a hard work as well as a great<br>example is she's identified two people<br>distant relatives who have to mermaid<br>with three copies of a gene called<br>blessing carboxylates big mouthful but<br>essentially what that what I seem bigger<br>box which does is it make it takes the<br>amino acid glycine and iterative and so<br>these people actually go through glycine<br>more<br>and my person is the person is it for<br>you and that is shown that of their fun<br>our double bond conditions if you give<br>these to people I see their their<br>symptoms develop and undergo<br>competitions services I don't know<br>whether a blur is it should become but<br>this is an example what we're trying to<br>do giving the licensure to help anybody<br>else on the play that public but for<br>these two people that follow me to be<br>different and that's the sort of thing<br>and this is just to show some of the<br>Maverick we've got a german oliver<br>rustling bomb who has something called<br>the stencil that we want a german<br>domingre stem cells oh but you<br>essentially have you put in a device<br>will settle and money at the start and<br>you get out in our rounds at the end and<br>motion the steps in between errata me so<br>it's pretty cool technology and this is<br>just some kinky stuff to show that it<br>actually works ok this is me and let's<br>go back I rolls again I'm intervention<br>tertiary Prevention's stops this<br>redeveloping better treatments and<br>really the key thing is a precise<br>understanding the biology the genes<br>identified will tell us ouch that's the<br>whole point and there's a something i<br>haven't mentioned this is extremely<br>important topic and there's certainly a<br>ton of local expertise here are kennedy<br>and his colleagues on pharmacogenetics<br>this is really more to tell about<br>tailoring nurses so for example you have<br>a particular disorder can we give you a<br>mess which is more effectively as<br>opposed to like messing around two or<br>three times this is a big deal in cancer<br>for instance where you really want to<br>make sure that you know you tailor of s<br>person has but another make part two is<br>at first drug reactions so as you know<br>many times in essence we give Ashley<br>toxic and one of the goals of this to<br>minimal time you can be identifying<br>people that are likely to react<br>immediately valley to medicine I start<br>sloughing your skin or something and<br>again this is a key part of tertiary<br>prevention this is not the work that are<br>going to do so I have a comment on what<br>it really is an absolutely critical<br>business okay so in terms of what is I<br>think I think it's basically proven now<br>that schizophrenia is important in other<br>cases we've done this twin studies<br>Family Studies to now we can look at the<br>bloody DNA and I think it really can't<br>be questioned but again and I believe<br>we're making progress the start of<br>finding is really quite subtle with non<br>deterministic I also think is proven the<br>environment support the people exposure<br>to stress a long time integrating<br>affections drug use etc certainly are<br>private in addition the choice is<br>equally sometimes sometimes we make<br>choices that actually don't push this in<br>the right direction and that of course<br>is important to one of the things just<br>under investigation right now a lot of<br>us is is trying to understand what the<br>mix of people is in a particular sample<br>crew with opinion I think it's likely<br>we're gonna find that there and if you<br>look at other peoples schizophrenia big<br>men that are very genetic of formal<br>state Supreme some people out of their<br>environmental and somebody only have<br>some<br>this is a major question right now can<br>you identify how comas mixes on but I<br>think it's really important that for<br>most people with this serious sethi itís<br>were the stuff that I'm doing right now<br>is not not on the clinical road okay<br>we're making progress with learning a<br>lot of stuff but it's going to take time<br>for this to actually feed back to the<br>punch to clinical sphere but there are a<br>couple exceptions I think that you know<br>it should be part of the additional<br>workout for Jewish a disability and<br>autism that's pretty clear right now I'm<br>certainly looking at copy number<br>variation and xmas eve listening clearly<br>has substantial in these two disorders I<br>think you're schizophrenic you with a<br>copy number variation in a<br>characteristic way you'll find that<br>something like three percent of people<br>probably have Cindy and this isn't work<br>I think because some of these physical<br>form entities and we may need to treat<br>them in different ways and the other one<br>of courses if someone has a dominant<br>form balls and your systems those are<br>probably the ones where i think you know<br>is really are indicated as art but this<br>is under investigation three years i<br>might end up saying something but really<br>the main implication of this whole<br>honestly the first time I really do<br>think me doing this is now a major issue<br>in psychiatry there's a lot of groups<br>within us we've been able to attract a<br>whole bunch of real first-rate<br>neuroscientists last time they're 30<br>laureates actually working on<br>psychiatric disorders as amazed because<br>that really is never happened before a<br>lot of a drug companies are actually<br>part of these at first they're getting<br>back and see in this business honestly<br>ten years ago most companies were<br>completely out of the cs business and<br>working with drug companies is always<br>kind of a mixed bag but the bottom line<br>is we investor's and if we identify<br>targets and those are things that they<br>may be equal to Kappa house on and now I<br>circle that as well so I think a lot of<br>us anticipate that there's who feel<br>progress in the next<br>years and then I close with my thanks<br>I've been really fortunate they have<br>great teachers starting with certainty<br>professor Joyce and mark Kennedy I've<br>got a couple great laughs okay you can<br>see if let's go one of colleagues I made<br>the nightmare people in VGC but that<br>would go to above 10 so as research<br>council any particular nothing for a lot<br>I<br>that's a fantastic question and there<br>are the problem though is that many of<br>the environmental risk factors are<br>difficult to assess so if I'm asking<br>somebody was 50 years old who's got<br>schizophrenia and seriously middle for a<br>very long time if I start asking about<br>what happened to mom you know second<br>trimester in utero that's not a higher<br>yield thing there are some way to get<br>around that so first it's possible to<br>analyze me because the infection side is<br>certainly carbon the launching with Bob<br>Milliken at Johns Hopkins will launch a<br>major push to do a lot of that there<br>soon but there's several countries in<br>the world would actually do reflect<br>automatically a lot of marveled at about<br>those countries are standing and that's<br>one of the reasons why Stan a vagina<br>hole so yeah so we're hopeful so we<br>actually have birth events we have out<br>our stores it's going to take a while to<br>yeah that's that's a that's a wonderful<br>question there's a lot of people who are<br>keenly interested in that particular<br>time there was a paper that may have<br>heard about and we'll talk about<br>depression be something related to the<br>NT falls I am super skeptical that I'm<br>going to try and repeat the analysis by<br>Adele it's true hey um so here's the<br>thing in order for evolution to act on<br>something typically you know for single<br>garrett it has to have a strong effect I<br>think there's so in other words if you<br>inherit something there's strong<br>legality roots to who me to to your<br>survival and only reduction it's nothing<br>it's nothing over right you probably got<br>with you almost literal that the problem<br>though with the things that we're<br>talking about is effects are tons of<br>ways there's no way evolution can act on<br>something which increases risk by point<br>by ten percent that's just far too<br>ssible people are wondering about<br>whether evolution like at not just on<br>one genetic they actually have learned<br>many of them simultaneously in other<br>words if you inherit you know 30<br>different variants that give you a<br>marketing better chance of doing<br>something or you hear some<br>characteristic because of that set of<br>variants and making that's within<br>evolution excellent the tricky thing is<br>to actually analyze that requires mess<br>sizes it's a non-stressful not as the<br>best so I'm not sure but some would<br>think you were looking at is try to look<br>for examples what's the correlation<br>between schizophrenia and variety<br>personality traits or intelligence that<br>kind of thing and some of those things<br>are kind of as being kind so for example<br>there's a there's a positive correlation<br>to buy a rose water and educational in<br>other words the genes that face those<br>two Bibles were also predisposed to do<br>better in school and never having<br>conversations with Peter Bava seven<br>years by horse or you certainly see a<br>lot of people who very successful<br>academically as well as important role<br>or whatever we know these people right<br>and don't have to sleep a lot of time<br>and can tell that they're not very<br>reliable but they add something so I<br>think the more likely thing is that some<br>of these things if you hear a sub<br>freshened might actually be advantageous<br>in certain characteristics but again<br>sure there was a paper that you look at<br>this there's a paper that came out<br>iceland looking at queen tin and skis<br>bring my ropes or an inclined have small<br>positive correlation if the distance<br>between their relationships Lego you to<br>find work that environmental factors are<br>it's a great question so the ? masters<br>if we actually have the biological<br>pathways sort of will they help us with<br>and I think there's a fair chance it<br>might I mean so many of our mental<br>effects of talking what are things which<br>we know the in a Cell so for example you<br>might be able to take a human being who<br>has you know Harry the ton of these were<br>schools make I guess seized from them<br>and then actually induced a bar no<br>stress in sunlight yeah what that is the<br>peasants dressed right there's some that<br>ad who stole the Sun than my naughty but<br>you could see what happened or even put<br>them into you take human cells put them<br>into a wellspring and then it Mouse with<br>the nominal stress and to see what<br>happens there are some things that might<br>be possible there was an example this in<br>Asia whenever Freddie age and some other<br>colleagues at UCSD did a study the<br>environmental factor was listening and<br>they were able to show that that neurons<br>july four people by boulders over canada<br>at 15 firing patterns and they normalize<br>was listening only if the person<br>responded clinical with you and not<br>lithium did not how to play so that's an<br>environmental fact but is in fact that<br>rapid oxidation pulls off that in the<br>revolution likes a lot of things but i<br>understand the Magnusson action with you<br>my autism drive a constable question<br>drag how these have the light look for<br>common disorders for which they can get<br>lots of people prescribed in traffic so<br>they can make in mail schizophrenia is<br>already one receipt so to let the<br>muggles Porter coming but if it's only<br>three 1,000 more people suit supreme<br>whoever blessing problem you're into<br>really orphan drugs and it becomes a<br>real risk that red cabbage is willing to<br>lease the money to ever find the<br>compounds how much any any resistance<br>from Brad companies to finding very<br>uncommon different metabolic lines or<br>scenes you know because there's no money<br>to be made out of Hong Kong disorders so<br>going to persevere first I think there<br>are obviously there's the established<br>the drug companies around<br>that's one thing but there's a ton of<br>stops and so angel is there's just there<br>are two major papers on this there's<br>several groups that are going crazy<br>about this there's a couple of small<br>island energy high-risk high-reward<br>rooms direction copies the Orioles a gym<br>is quite rare but if you can actually<br>reverse it you know that will give me<br>thing the reason why from our<br>perspective yes it's uncommon but if you<br>have it you gotta take the drug every<br>day for us your life and so anything so<br>much college
