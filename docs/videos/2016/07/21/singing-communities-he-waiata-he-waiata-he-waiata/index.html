then<br>because I work in the creative arts and<br>industries I have creatively<br>reconstructed it to suggest that perhaps<br>the most important thing is singing<br>singing<br>singing good afternoon I'm Tori and I'm<br>a singing<br>addict I love singing in all its forms I<br>love singing as a verb and a<br>gerent I love all the diverse ways that<br>can impact people's quality of life from<br>Cradle to grave and today I would like<br>to briefly introduce you to the singing<br>communities project which is a portfolio<br>of research studies that I've been<br>involved with emerging from the areas of<br>vocal performance and coral studies and<br>give you a snapshot of my current<br>project which looks at the state of<br>singing in Primary School schools and<br>shows you an extract from a potential<br>intervention model in practice singing<br>activities feature prominently in a<br>wealth of recent International Studies<br>into the<br>neurosciences and music into physical<br>and psychological health and well-being<br>social skill development which my<br>colleague has talked about and social<br>development Community performance sites<br>are providing musical contexts for the<br>creation of healing interventions in the<br>area of population health and I use as<br>an example not one of my research<br>projects but the celebration choir I<br>like to roll that out at all possible<br>moments it's a fantastic um project from<br>the center of brain research um headed<br>by my very dear colleague um Professor<br>Suzanne pie with music therapists<br>Allison tamage and Sharon story however<br>we also have something similar in the<br>yor at the moment in progress music mov<br>trust which is singing working with<br>dementia patients<br>Community performance sites are also<br>locations that can help communities<br>counter the effects of diaspora and col<br>colonization by sustaining languages and<br>cultural knowledge through music making<br>and I give it as an example there a<br>project um Niki was involved with to<br>Valu Pacific project where we treated<br>music as a biocultural music resource<br>and uh it was archival in that we um<br>digitalized all of their two Valle media<br>archive um because it's really an<br>important um representation of old songs<br>in talu and then of course um<br>decolonizing the mar voice that's about<br>Partnerships with um kapahaka uh groups<br>um working towards the mattini and<br>talking about vocal health and<br>redefining uh rehearsing and what that<br>might look like when you're going<br>through what they call a<br>campaign in this project the impact of<br>singing extends into the learning<br>cultures of universities and schools<br>partnersh ship between practice based<br>singing researchers performers like<br>myself and music educators are producing<br>future teachers who think both as music<br>instructors and critical cultural<br>workers the this partnership has the<br>potential to support the quality and<br>quantity of Music practice in particular<br>singing in New Zealand primary schools<br>why is this important well we know<br>singing can impact people's lives in a<br>very positive way this stage of a<br>child's learning experience is a<br>critical moment in the development of a<br>students's attitude to music future<br>opinion about music and participation in<br>music I'll add to that because I'm sure<br>um many of you may have had bad<br>experiences in dance but probably many<br>more of you have heard from more<br>experiences about your voice and this is<br>a really important stage for<br>self-actualization um about your own<br>singing ability what that looks like and<br>what that means so this brings us to the<br>state of singing in primary schools<br>rather than entering the debate on the<br>benefits and effectiveness of an Arts<br>integrated curriculum this program<br>sought to investigate how to improve<br>singing cultures and primary schools to<br>do this we undertook a national survey<br>to understand the challenges primary<br>schools face in creating maintaining and<br>sustaining music programs and singing<br>activities in the current New Zealand<br>educational<br>context Central findings have allowed<br>the researchers in the school of music<br>to empathize with the teachers and this<br>has allowed us to begin the process of<br>creating meaningful and Sustainable<br>Solutions with this in mind the findings<br>been con contextualized within the<br>international literature and the most<br>part aligned with um International<br>Trends in music education however there<br>were two areas quite interesting I think<br>for us as tiery teachers and researchers<br>that was<br>um there was a passionate discussion<br>about the problems of an overcrowded<br>curriculum at a primary school level um<br>an issue that has created Primary School<br>teachers see a generation of children<br>that struggle to commit to any subject<br>area curriculum or non-curriculum and<br>have difficulty absorbing skills and<br>knowledge Beyond a superficial level of<br>understanding which I think filters up<br>certainly we find that in School of<br>Music it filters upwards to the<br>churchery<br>level also another passionate discussion<br>and I'm might full of literacy and<br>numeracy people in this room um schools<br>directing funds resources and<br>professional development away from the<br>Arts curriculum um many Primary School<br>teachers found that deeply disappointing<br>when increasingly empirical evidence<br>shows that involvement with the Arts<br>leads to measurable cognitive gains and<br>music instruction in particular showing<br>positive effects on verbal memory and<br>spatial skills verbal ability and<br>non-verbal reasoning better questioning<br>skills more focused periods of intense<br>concentration and great greater<br>understandings that problems can have<br>multiple answers in fact the solution<br>tion to the issues of overcrowded<br>curriculum so the current survey<br>provides a snapshot of the context in<br>which Primary School teachers work and<br>while the Dilemma is complex and<br>multifaceted we can draw inspiration<br>from many International models including<br>the United Kingdom model singing<br>playgrounds singing playgrounds is a<br>non-curriculum singing activity singing<br>Educators gr they train a group of<br>children to lead their peirs and playing<br>singing games in the playground the<br>children are trained to lead<br>share adapt and create singing games and<br>a teacher is trained to support them in<br>that role to understand this program we<br>were able to bring the practitioners to<br>New Zealand and provide over a week a<br>national professional development event<br>from which 60 Primary School teachers<br>around new zeen came a national singing<br>day with over 250 children it's quite<br>loud um and through these activities and<br>Associated workshops over the week we<br>were able to create a platform for<br>discussing a national vision for singing<br>in New Zealand with professional<br>teaching organizations menah um Carl<br>Federation professional Carl<br>organizations and music therapy<br>organizations and school<br>teachers um and Inspire those of us with<br>an interest in taking singing forward in<br>k</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
