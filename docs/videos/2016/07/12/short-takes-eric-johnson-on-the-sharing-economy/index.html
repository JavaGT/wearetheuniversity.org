University's Owen Graduate School of Management, explains how New Zealand SMEs can benefit from the 'sharing economy'.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well today there's so much interest in<br>the sharing economy it really captured<br>people's imagination about six seven<br>years ago uh think back to the time of<br>the recession and and there was so much<br>uh concern about where the growth was<br>going to be and what was the next big<br>advantage or industry and out of that<br>came this idea of sharing<br>and some of it was so simple you know<br>the idea of a power drill you know we we<br>all own power drills in our homes um in<br>the US we maybe spend $30 $40 for a<br>power drill and over the lifetime of<br>that power drill I probably would use it<br>about 12 to 15 minutes do I really need<br>to own a power drill for a few holes<br>over the lifetime of that drill and so<br>the idea of the sharing economy was<br>creating a compelling way for people in<br>neighborhoods in communities to to be<br>able to share a lawnmower a power drill<br>a vacuum cleaner a pressure washer uh<br>and not have to own that and that was<br>the original idea so you roll forward to<br>2016 and many now are disappointed with<br>how the sharing economy has actually<br>evolved many many of the startups that<br>came out in 2009 10 11 around this idea<br>of sharing consumer goods and and<br>consumer assets have disappeared they've<br>failed um what has come in their place<br>are another set of companies that we<br>often refer to as sharing economy Uber<br>Lyft Airbnb they're slightly different<br>and they look much more like big<br>business than maybe this utopian idea of<br>sharing a power drill in your<br>neighborhood but they have in fact<br>unlocked a whole new industry around the<br>world uh sometimes people call it the<br>gig economy uh the idea that I work for<br>short periods of time on little jobs I'm<br>still using my assets a car a house an<br>apartment um but I'm doing that uh<br>enabled through a sophisticated app that<br>allows me to join a very Dynamic<br>Marketplace so many of us that watch the<br>the space called the sharing economy now<br>think that the business applications may<br>be much bigger than the Consumer<br>applications that is businesses often<br>have the same problem that you and I<br>have with that power drill that is they<br>own expens assets uh in the supply chain<br>those are warehouses they trucks uh all<br>kinds of transport equipment and uh for<br>many companies they may not really get<br>high utilization out of that warehouse<br>and so is there a way for them to be<br>able to share that uh and share that in<br>a way that uh they profit from owning it<br>but others can buy space for example in<br>the warehouse literally by the drink we<br>call it that is simply for a short<br>period of time a short use use uh very<br>much like you might do uh with a a ride<br>on lift but there are many other<br>interesting applications now evolving<br>for example in healthc care which is an<br>area of my own research we now see uh<br>this idea coming of sharing medical<br>equipment between hospitals and for<br>example in the US there's a startup<br>company called kohilo which really makes<br>a business by creating a market for<br>equipment that hospitals can share so<br>not every hospital needs that special<br>special surgical device or x-ray or<br>Imaging device uh maybe we have one of<br>those in our city and it is shared uh in<br>a way that we all benefit from that but<br>there's a market that's made and the<br>owner of that asset is able to monetize<br>the value of that so over time we really<br>could imagine that many asset intensive<br>Industries uh could benefit by some form<br>of the sharing economy this ability to<br>share expensive assets<br>and we see this is particularly true in<br>smaller cities more rural areas uh<br>smaller countries where uh the assets<br>are very expensive and maybe not highly<br>utilized uh so that if they can be<br>shared across multiple players in that<br>particular industry suddenly they become<br>economically viable and useful so the<br>exciting thing for a country like New<br>Zealand in the sharing economy is this<br>ability to create services and products<br>that might not otherwise be viable uh in<br>that Marketplace so at one level of<br>course uh New Zealand benefits from many<br>of the same kinds of phenomenons that<br>any Western country is facing right now<br>with the Ubers and airbnbs and lifts you<br>know we see City hop here in ockland to<br>be able to rent cars you know those<br>kinds of things are uh happening<br>everywhere but at the businesso business<br>level you can imagine the ability of a<br>much smaller company to gain access to<br>equipment or infrastructure that they<br>wouldn't normally have so for example if<br>you're a small uh company in Auckland<br>that uh is building a supply chain<br>rather than having to make long-term<br>leases on a warehouse which would be<br>expensive and risky if I could buy uh<br>little bits of space uh through the<br>sharing economy in a warehouse it allows<br>me to much more quickly come to Market<br>with products that I might not otherwise<br>be able to do so the exciting thing for<br>New Zealand is we have a very Dynamic<br>economy here of small and medium<br>businesses and the sharing economy what<br>we might call a sharing economy really<br>allows those businesses to tap into<br>infrastructure grow much more quickly<br>enter new markets it really is in many<br>ways perfectly suited for those smmes to<br>be able to jump in quickly and uh gain<br>market</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
