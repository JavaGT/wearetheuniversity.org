you very much for the area that<br>I get involved in and Jonathan Decatur<br>my field as well as patterns doing<br>something which people actually believed<br>was impossible for for many hundreds of<br>years which is kind of exciting because<br>it gives you a lot of room to move when<br>people don't believe that you can do it<br>but it's based on science and the great<br>thing is it's based on two new element<br>speak to people and be if you said that<br>it can't we've done why you would get a<br>field in here and Faraday that CFP Board<br>of coil into that field you detect<br>it's been around making just possible to<br>actually make it really possible to<br>actually use this technology for all<br>sorts of applications and solving for<br>Paula problems and to do that we can<br>actually we can actually put it into<br>lots of places where people thought it<br>couldn't transfer the project I want to<br>talk about today is one which is taking<br>my interest for 20 years these are<br>interesting and but more focused around<br>the last decade in practice and it's a<br>vision of a future city where we are<br>vehicles and a lot of issues with people<br>want and using them were concerned that<br>people in these vehicles to cables with<br>people nowadays actually steal the<br>cables there's all sorts of things<br>because coppers have been shorter you<br>know it's really high resource and and<br>taking it too it's something which is<br>invisible which city planners and so<br>he's down this pathway to try and make<br>this happen<br>part of the driver of the pressure it's<br>a difficult driver to pushing yourself<br>ever see personally come from the parent<br>transport section and and the whole goal<br>here is to say well if we can clean up<br>these emissions we it's a great driver<br>footage of vehicles but in the other<br>current agreements and the network I<br>just cleaning up people's today so we<br>are looking obviously to power these<br>vehicles and to actually do it without<br>being conventional generation which were<br>typically running out so we've got this<br>problem that we need to bring in the<br>green energy sources the ones that are<br>that are no cleaner conventional means<br>or that we actually can't breathe we<br>just can't bring any more high driving<br>into our mixes but these systems are<br>very flexible and what we've got to do<br>is try and get these flexible energy<br>sources and bring those across to and<br>into vehicles and this growing demand<br>for power and<br>really nice max to bring together so<br>it's a nice efficient to sell so we<br>started off with these kind of visions<br>in anyways we pushed to try and get<br>people to get involved with us you think<br>that would be easy but it's a bit like<br>just direct kind of the vision becomes<br>quite large in what you find is that<br>people sort of can believe in a certain<br>vision but actually when you tell people<br>you want to take over the world<br>vehicles and sort of influence the way<br>we voting's built probably less that we<br>had first of all to prove that the<br>technology was viable and so in 2009<br>which showcased the fact that we<br>connected power an electric vehicle<br>across a foot at the same efficiency as<br>a plug-in charger and that was we were<br>kind of told that they we were the<br>tricking people or could it really be<br>seriously church of equals when we talk<br>to the car manufacturers they said<br>they'd be near the dirt war they didn't<br>really see this really changing<br>interesting thing as five days later<br>they told us this was the no brain of<br>technology that they don't have to take<br>on board and we went from a case of<br>launching company to selling it which<br>sells really strange to do but keeping<br>all of the intellectual property and in<br>a global vehicle derecha take the<br>technology forward but the research is<br>done here and try and and develop what<br>we're going to end up with in this<br>technology in the next 10 years so<br>interesting enough from a state of ten<br>years ago to carnal purchase over would<br>never see this technology in their<br>lifetime they now have nearly completed<br>the standardization of this technology<br>for vehicles and so the question that I<br>wanted to talk about David we don't we<br>talk tethers this technology and its<br>really a quite a challenge happen in the<br>future the the drivers for electric<br>vehicles and the drivers for the<br>technology are address societal<br>trainings whoever that we thought was<br>that we better and we can see the<br>pleasure in Auckland but this is<br>happening globally people are moving<br>into cities problems which are<br>population health problems there's all<br>sorts of air pollution issue that having<br>to deal with the health costs the<br>actually grow the number of vehicles<br>more than double up by 2050 and if they<br>aren't electric vehicles were in trouble<br>and our vision is to try and encourage<br>electric vehicles to be used now that<br>the challenges not just stationary<br>parking but to be able to transfer power<br>when vehicles are moving into life that<br>areas or actually when the driving on a<br>highway and the aiming to do this is to<br>try and take the technology so that we<br>don't have to have it sounds simple but<br>it's not believe in this version<br>globally you are starting to work on it<br>we are still at the forefront of the<br>technology but I can tell you it's a<br>race and it's exciting racing with lots<br>of questions of how to do it we need to<br>try and find a way of transferring power<br>in what is a very conservative art<br>environment and people don't like<br>digging up the roads we need to look at<br>all of the extending it around services<br>like rail buses and the like and we need<br>to try and find a way to actually<br>integrate that with what is we need to<br>work towards highway power as they're<br>driving along along the road and to do<br>we need to enter the vehicle of the<br>federal highway at a hundred levels and<br>am<br>we know that part of the people are<br>working toward election they wouldn't<br>receive the recognition and billing but<br>that if she would God is it's not just<br>one leaf on the right we've got tracks<br>we've got small powers the system<br>designed to the smallest vehicle they<br>handle the language truck which is the<br>right thing it's going to be able to<br>deal with energy demand the recipient<br>which appear in the grid supply we can<br>mention one very versatile integrated<br>supply in terms of the energy mixers<br>that people want and it needs we were<br>bused to reliable and of course people<br>mix so the challenges we've got and we<br>are working people are huge we need to<br>prove economically that it's viable but<br>equally solve one of these problems<br>which actually a long way outside my<br>expertise and so people who excited got<br>such a vision uncertainty came to talk<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
