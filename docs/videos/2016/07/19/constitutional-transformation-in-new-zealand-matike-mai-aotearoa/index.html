Maori studies now this project<br>that I've been hitting for well since<br>2009 is about constitutional<br>transformation in this country the name<br>we have matic in my out there or was<br>given to us by an elder co martyr from<br>Taranaki who was brought on as an expert<br>on to the project and this diagram you<br>can see here is actually the logo for<br>our group that was given to us by the<br>young people because when you're looking<br>at constitutional matters it's probably<br>not my generation that's going to be<br>doing this stuff or even my children's<br>generation it's going to be the<br>grandchildren who are going to be doing<br>the nuts and bolts of this so we asked<br>them to visualize and then put into logo<br>form a country that in which the balance<br>was restored and I'll talk to you about<br>what I mean by the balance restored and<br>this diagram talks about from the top to<br>the bottom that's a that's take our Maui<br>the North Island and how when you've got<br>it balanced properly where Papa - and<br>look who the mother earth has properly<br>looked after and able to look after<br>people how everything from right down<br>beneath Papa - enugu right up to the<br>heavens is all in balance so what was<br>the problem that we had to address it's<br>one that Maori have had for over 150<br>years and that is our constitutional<br>powerlessness and a body that I serve on<br>as a result of being the chairperson of<br>my a we is national eariy chairs forum<br>at the moment there are about 70 he<br>chairs that serve on that body we come<br>together to try and address common<br>issues that we're all<br>grunting and to try and help each other<br>and find solutions over it and what we<br>found after a few years which we'd known<br>for a long time was that we could not at<br>the end of the day make any real<br>difference to the injustice 'as the<br>inequalities the denial of rights land<br>and resource confiscations that go on to<br>this day the racism the deep deep<br>bitterness amongst our people over the<br>imposition of the treaty settlements<br>process we could not address them and<br>that was making our job extremely<br>difficult extremely frustrating what the<br>one thing that Jane was talking about<br>about the TPPA was just one of many of<br>the issues that we just kept running<br>into a brick wall over and no amount of<br>talking or trying to be nice or anything<br>like that actually produced any<br>difference it just ran us around around<br>in circles and so the matter of<br>constitutional transformation which is<br>quite different from constitutional<br>change constitutional changes when you<br>fiddle with what's already there and try<br>and make things a bit better<br>constitutional transformation is when<br>you start all over again and try and do<br>something that will fix up the huge<br>problems you have so this decision about<br>the need for constitutional<br>transformation is not new in married and<br>we had three huge whois gatherings in<br>the 1990s that said this had to be done<br>but then of course we didn't have the<br>resources to do it then along came the<br>foreshore and seabed and that really<br>motivated us to come on and hurry up and<br>do the job<br>so we're it's required to reinstate the<br>balance between mana more to at mana<br>Maori more to hockey now it's often<br>referred to as Maori sovereignty but<br>it's what was protected under 2-to DT or<br>Waitangi and that is our power and<br>authority within this land as the<br>original people of this land and we are<br>responsible for this country in that<br>respect so it's the balance between that<br>and British Caruana Tonga the British<br>governance<br>that we agreed that they could have over<br>British subjects and over other<br>immigrants and that balance was set out<br>very very clearly entity duty and if<br>that balance had been upheld we wouldn't<br>have the horrific problems we do in the<br>Maori world at the moment so we were<br>looking for constitutional<br>transformation that would restore that<br>balance and get you back to that diagram<br>that the young people came up with so<br>the research question became what<br>constitutional model for altered or<br>would restore the balance between mana<br>Maori and the British Carwin a tongue<br>and and be based upon now there are<br>three very important areas that had to<br>be based on first of all there is stick<br>honor<br>now trick honor is often translated into<br>English as protocol but in actual fact<br>it's our legal system it's the first<br>legal system of this country and it is<br>the one that remains to this day even<br>though it's not formally recognized koa<br>is another term in the north we use two<br>canals where they use color so that's<br>why I've got both of them there it is<br>our maori philosophy and law and then<br>this incredibly important document that<br>colonising historians colonising<br>governments have chosen to chose them to<br>say doesn't exist but I'm afraid it does<br>hey how could put down with your under<br>your tongue or on you tyranny the<br>declaration of sovereignty of New<br>Zealand of 1835 and I know that most New<br>Zealanders don't even know that this<br>exists however the Waitangi tribunal<br>held a hearing and came out with a<br>report confirming that this is<br>fundamentally important to this country<br>and that stated that the sovereignty of<br>this country lies in the harpoon not the<br>Eyrie the bigger organisations but in<br>the hapu and that was signed an 1835<br>accepted by the British crown and then<br>the consequence of that was the treaty<br>that allowed British immigration in here<br>on the condition that the kakapo turnout<br>remained<br>and was upheld and that the British<br>governed their own people but we also<br>looked at other indigenous right human<br>rights instruments which enjoy a wide<br>degree of international recognition and<br>in particular there is the United<br>Nations declaration on the rights of<br>indigenous people but we also looked at<br>the s√°mi examples the Bolivian examples<br>in particular now the research team<br>itself was established in 2009 by the<br>nationally we cheers forum it is called<br>as I said Matic in my outset or it means<br>rise up rise up and get yourself going<br>to get things sorted we are the<br>independent working group on<br>constitutional transformation it is<br>convened this is a really odd thing they<br>nationally we chairs told me I had to<br>chair it because they needed somebody<br>who could cope with the academic<br>intellectual type stuff that was needed<br>but really the expert in this field is<br>miner Jackson and he is what I would<br>call a legal philosopher would that be<br>right Jane yeah<br>making nificent mind on the spit man now<br>the membership was the best<br>constitutional and Chicana or mari law<br>brains that we had in Meriden when we<br>asked he to send us their experts guess<br>what they sent us a whole lot of Western<br>trained lawyers and it wasn't actually<br>what we wanted but hey they were very<br>very good what we wanted was those<br>trained and Maori laws so we had to<br>co-opt those we asked the urban Maori<br>for authorities to come in we ended up<br>with a total of 40 members they came and<br>went<br>because unlike University projects that<br>we do research projects that we do this<br>was all voluntary however in the<br>development of the model there were<br>really clear rules we had to attend<br>gatherings throughout the country which<br>were convened to discuss this new<br>constitutional model at each Hui we<br>would introduce the topic briefly and<br>then work on a questionnaire in groups<br>and it took<br>a year to develop that questionnaire<br>asking simple questions like if you<br>could make a decision about your life<br>tomorrow what would that be based on and<br>how would you make those decisions<br>because that's all the Constitution is<br>is it's a set of rules that you all<br>agree to abide by how you have to ensure<br>that Mari were fully informed and<br>participate in the development of the<br>model and then we had to report our<br>engagement and progress back to the<br>nationally reaches for them it meets<br>four times a year and our final research<br>report you know it wasn't originally jus<br>in 2013 we ended up doing it in 2016<br>funding provided mainly by a<br>philanthropic source and buying our pie<br>automata Matunga here it was jr.<br>McKenzie trust that funded this in the<br>end but as Jane was saying you get on<br>and do the work and the funding comes<br>out the work to date I have to I'm out<br>of time two hundred and fifty two who<br>around the country because you've got to<br>engage all of Maori all who he would<br>transcribe question is analyzed the<br>basis of the final report the interviews<br>with individual experts to check the<br>interpretations this took over a year<br>report was tabled February this year<br>where six possible models were proposed<br>and seven recommendations made for<br>further work all the recommendations<br>were accepted we are now having further<br>who around the country and the report<br>there it is that's the report there 125<br>pages of the most beautifully
