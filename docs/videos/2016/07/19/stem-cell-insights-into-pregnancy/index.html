want to introduce you<br>to this organ here this is the placenta<br>um it's probably one of the most<br>underappreciated organs in the human<br>body I think but we should all stop and<br>just give this guy a bit of credit<br>because this is what keeps you alive in<br>utero for 40 weeks and it did this by<br>being a pretty amazing multifunctional<br>organ so it acted as your lung as your<br>gut absorbing both oxygen and nutrients<br>from Mom's blood it acted as a bit of<br>the kidney taking fetal wastes and<br>excreting them back into the maternal<br>circulation and there was also a major<br>endocrine organ regulating not only the<br>baby's growth but adapting mom's whole<br>physiology so that she was able to<br>sustain that baby throughout the length<br>of<br>gestation so this is a pretty incredible<br>organ but it's also probably the least<br>understood organ in the human body um<br>and that's a bit of a problem because in<br>one in 10 pregnancies this organ doesn't<br>quite do what it should so this leads to<br>things like fetal growth restriction<br>when baby's born too small and also<br>leads to conditions such as preeclampsia<br>which is Mom gets dangerously elevated<br>blood<br>pressure and these are especially a<br>problem because there's actually very<br>little we can do about these disorders<br>um usually what happens is that baby is<br>delivered to remove the placenta and<br>that usually happens before it should do<br>ingest so my group's major research<br>question is how does the henta actually<br>form in normal pregnancy why does this<br>go wrong so often and what on Earth can<br>do about it and when we're trying to<br>approach these questions we actually<br>really need to focus on the very early<br>events in pregnancy so the<br>pathophysiology of pregnancy disorders<br>is established often within the first 10<br>to 12 weeks of<br>pregnancy um but understanding this in<br>humans is exceptionally difficult<br>obviously it's ethically and um<br>logistically impossible to get early<br>implantation sites from Human<br>pregnancies and we need to study this in<br>humans because actually most laboratory<br>animals models don't have the same<br>anatomical structure as a human<br>placenta so we've gone about tackling<br>this problem by looking at the stem<br>cells from which the placenta is formed<br>there are two types of stem cell<br>populations that I work with tropas stem<br>cells and mimal stem cells so to explain<br>a little bit about what an earth these<br>are um let me just talk you through the<br>placenta a bit up here so you can<br>imagine the placenta like a branching<br>tree and if you were going to take a<br>cross-section through one of the nice<br>leafy branches at the end this is what<br>see on the outside here you have Mom's<br>blood circulating around and what you<br>can see largely in blue here are the<br>troph blast layers so these are<br>responsible for taking the nutrients<br>from Mom's blood and bringing them into<br>the placenta and so when we look at trop<br>blast stem cells we're trying to<br>understand how these different types of<br>tabus form and how they're doing that<br>drawing up the nutrients into the placa<br>properly then if we look on the inside<br>we can see in green here this developing<br>um system of blood vessels so the this<br>is an early gation benter we're looking<br>gation we get to the next slide somehow<br>as we develop throughout G station um<br>this network continues to develop and<br>become extensively branched so that um<br>it sort of maximizes the ability to take<br>these nutrients the troob bast is<br>drawing up and transfer them through the<br>umbilical cord to the fetus and what we<br>think mesal stem cells are doing in the<br>in the placenta is playing really key<br>roles in both forming these blood<br>vessels at the start of pregnancy and<br>regulating how they branch and expand<br>throughout pregnancy to optimize that<br>process um I really can't get the slides<br>going<br>here awesome thank you cool um and we<br>know that this process of blood<br>development and blood vessel development<br>is really important because this is one<br>of the key things that can go wrong in<br>growth restriction so when growth<br>restricted babies we're not getting<br>enough nutrient transfer into the<br>placenta and we're not getting enough<br>circulation so let me start by talking a<br>little bit about the work we've been<br>doing on human tabas stem cells the<br>major problem when working with human<br>teras stem cells is that we actually<br>don't have a human tust stem cell that's<br>been isolated and characterized to work<br>with in vitro um so a bit of a stumbling<br>block Mouse trifas stem cells were<br>isolated more than 15 years ago and we<br>have this amazing knowledge of all the<br>cell differentiation events happening in<br>the mous center but as I said we need to<br>know how the relates to the human and<br>what's actually relevant from that data<br>to what we can apply to the human<br>pregnancy so sort of for the four last<br>four to five years um I've really<br>focused on trying to pull out the first<br>humanr stem cell so that we can<br>understand what's happening in early<br>pregnancy so that we can learn what's<br>important and what's not important so to<br>do this I've um taken a characteristic<br>of most adult stem cell population so<br>the stem cells that kind of live in all<br>of your tissues and play roles in<br>regeneration and repair and this is that<br>they like to survive better than all the<br>other cells in the tissue so if you put<br>a toxin near them they spit it out<br>really<br>quickly and that's exactly what we can<br>see yeah it's buzzing at me now that's<br>exactly what we can see up here so we've<br>put a fluorescent toxin essentially near<br>these cells um and the low standing<br>intensity streak you can see is those<br>cells spitting it out fast and we can<br>separate out those cells I've shown that<br>they're 99% trophy blast so they're the<br>kind of cells we want and they also when<br>we profile the gene expression of these<br>cells they express markers<br>characteristic of other types of stem<br>cells as well as mous trob stem cells<br>and very early tabus lineages in the<br>placenta so they look and smell like we<br>would hope a human tabus stem cell would<br>would would look and smell um and that's<br>really exciting we can also isolate<br>these from both early gation placentas<br>and from turn placentas so early gation<br>placentas are going to let us understand<br>how the placenta grows and develops but<br>actually I'm more excited about the the<br>fact we can get these out at term<br>because this means we can take a normal<br>placenta and a growth rested placenta<br>and this is exactly what we're doing in<br>the lab at the moment and we can take<br>the stem cells from those placentas we<br>can hopefully understand how they got to<br>be like they are so how that pathology<br>gation so M Ando stem cells are my nice<br>easy stem cell to work with there's a<br>lot of um data on the literature<br>characterizing these cells we know<br>exactly what they should Express on<br>their cell surface so we can<br>characterize them<br>and show that the cells we've pulled out<br>are mesal stem cells we can again<br>isolate these from both first trimester<br>and term placentas and I'm really<br>interested in knowing how these cells<br>contribute to that vessel development at<br>the start of pregnancy how they interact<br>with the vessels throughout pregnancy<br>because they actually live right around<br>those vessels in the placenta and we<br>think they secrete things that<br>contribute to their ability to Branch<br>out extensively and why this goes wrong<br>restriction so in the popular press um<br>mesal stem cells often receive attention<br>because of their roles in regenerative<br>medicine and this they kind of do us a<br>really neat thing so if you took a<br>cardiac setting because a lot of this<br>work has been done in the cardiac field<br>um and you induced something called a<br>cardiac infaction so you damage an area<br>of that cardiac tissue and you<br>transplanted mesal stem cells into that<br>tissue what they would do is actually<br>work to help heal and repair that tissue<br>and they would do this in two ways they<br>would do it by um improving angiogenesis<br>so stimulating blood vessel growth<br>and also by acting in an<br>immunomodulatory way so dampening<br>inflammation in that tissue and that's<br>been shown to have clinically<br>significant effects and improving the<br>sort of regeneration and function of the<br>heart what I think is even cooler is<br>that if you took a um a patient that had<br>a cardiac infact and actually not inject<br>the cells into the tissue just injected<br>them into the main<br>circulation then what those cells would<br>do is hunt out that area of damage in<br>the body home there and then have those<br>actions<br>so they're quite remarkable um and<br>placental Moma stem cells have been used<br>in this kind of way to treat other<br>organs but actually what I want to know<br>is could they be used on the or from<br>which they come so could we use<br>placental mesal stem cells to treat<br>problems in placental um development<br>blood vessel growth areas of infection<br>in the placenta um areas of sterile<br>information that we sometimes see in<br>cases that seems a little bit um out<br>there I guess so it's going to involve<br>transplanting stem cells into a baby in<br>uturo but actually this is on the<br>medical Horizon at the moment so the<br>first trials injecting momal stem cells<br>and utero are already starting in the<br>states to treat osteogenesis and<br>perfecta so this is definitely something<br>we could feasibly look at in the future<br>but of course first we need to have some<br>solid solid science behind it so we've<br>started out looking at this in vitro um<br>so what you can see<br>here are that we've injected<br>fluorescently lay laed mesal stem cells<br>into chunks of first trimester and term<br>placental tissue and when we do this<br>what we see is that they Branch out and<br>form these networks throughout the<br>tissue so they migrate throughout the<br>tissue and they also scoop around the<br>blood vessels so they're Hing to their<br>natural Niche where they would live in<br>vitro and Vivo sorry and you can see<br>these up here a bit as well and that's<br>excellent because that's exactly what we<br>would want them to do if we're<br>transplanting them in Vivo so what we're<br>now trying to figure out is actually<br>what they're doing once they get there<br>what are they secreting how are they<br>going to influence those<br>vessels and could we then take these<br>cells into an invivo model and see if we<br>can actually rescue a growth rejected<br>phenotype by transplanting mesal stem<br>there so All That Remains is to hope<br>that I've generated some level of<br>excitement in the audience about me<br>about placental stem cells um and to<br>thank the people that give me money to<br>play around and do this and all my<br>collaborators and students that have<br>contributed bits along the<br>way</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
