be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks Diane I'm actually here on behalf<br>of more than 50 uh University of Oakland<br>researchers from uh the light metals<br>Research Center and and the product<br>accelerator and other programs that<br>we've run over the years um and I I've<br>got five points that I want to run<br>through exemplify to try and um show the<br>way step changes in manufacturing can<br>occur the first one is that<br>um you have to be in the data<br>stream you have to see the problems<br>every day that manufacturers and and I'm<br>including materials processes of all all<br>types I'm including uh designers<br>industrial designers uh since uh we have<br>some industrial designers in the room I<br>think<br>um all all of the step<br>changes any step change can only be made<br>made on the basis of of uh inspiration<br>and usually stimuli and stimuli needs<br>data and you need to be in the data<br>stream and unfortunately although we try<br>and uh kther Simpson's new company in<br>gender will help we need about another<br>hundred or 200 of them um the university<br>is not in the manufacturing data<br>stream and we we we struggle with that<br>um I I'll give you an an example<br>um I guess um we were asked by a New<br>Zealand to um if we could produce a new<br>generation of of spare parts because um<br>a um a certain spare part that I I<br>probably shouldn't say what it is but<br>but you use it in uh in the um uh<br>facility that Dees was referring to in<br>the front of the airplane apparently um<br>costs $8,000 to produce takes uh between<br>6 and 12 months to arrive in New Zealand<br>and then a New Zealand can install it we<br>3D printed them uh for I think it was<br>$100 um they were better stronger had a<br>better surface finish uh and went<br>straight into the airplanes um and to do<br>that though we spent before that about<br>uh six or seven years working with uh<br>airframe uh fitout um specialist<br>designers in New Zealand companies to<br>understand what were the types of issues<br>with these uh these fit out uh of parts<br>and then we used the the a technology<br>for additive manufacturing digital um<br>production to to make them uh at one of<br>the uh universities not too far from<br>here um so uh and we've had other many<br>examples where um in the construction<br>industry um the types of things like<br>this Frame here or um racking and piping<br>for utilities is the first thing that<br>fails in an earthquake because of the um<br>the the the the lack of damping in those<br>structures as as the building sways and<br>uh we<br>we with that knowledge we were able to<br>design um some damping structures and uh<br>3D print them by uh another technique<br>fused deposition modeling with the right<br>modulus so that they damp the vibration<br>two stiff structures don't do that but<br>uh overseas they made stiff structures<br>using selective laser centering which<br>didn't work because they didn't have the<br>right modulus um stress strain<br>relationship so these things can only uh<br>be done if you're in the data stream and<br>I guess that's the first learning that<br>we've had um you need to be out in the<br>Laboratories that are in factories in<br>fact your laboratory probably will be a<br>factory not a not a laboratory in the<br>university and that's a bit of a<br>cultural thing for the universities uh<br>to to sort of take on board um but it's<br>it's essential um you know a<br>practitioner or rather a university<br>researcher like myself might see two or<br>three manufacturing problems a month a<br>practitioner uh in a factory sees 20 or<br>so a day<br>the data stream and they and they're<br>different data they're not published<br>data in journals they're the real the<br>real problems that nobody knows about<br>and don't get published so you have to<br>be there<br>um the second point about about step<br>changes in manufacturing and referring<br>to researchers here is is that the big<br>projects are both fundable and<br>achievable within the<br>university um by big I mean you know<br>we've had in the last 14 years four MB<br>grants uh about $10 million each um but<br>to to to get the money you have to uh<br>not only say but you have to actually<br>achieve an outcome which is significant<br>that that warrants the investment of the<br>money which makes I think good sense and<br>MB uh uh do fund on that basis uh but to<br>do that that means you have to have a<br>team of 10 to 20 people and the people<br>have to be experienced in various areas<br>including in the community and<br>especially in the community so uh if<br>you're going to bid for that sort of<br>money from MBI um and and if you're<br>going to get a track record where you've<br>actually managed to uh achieve some of<br>what you said you were going to um it<br>means that you have to manage teams that<br>are larger you know one or two people<br>it's difficult to do<br>it's difficult it's not difficult to do<br>some research but it's difficult to get<br>it applied um and I guess the the part<br>oh thank you one minute um the part of<br>this which is which is tough is that um<br>our research is rather than applied it's<br>application inspired so um one of the<br>inventions that one of my colleagues<br>over here PR pels had a lot to do with<br>is uh heat exchanges where we had to<br>take um the heat transfer coefficient<br>for a heat transfer fluid called air<br>anyone I guess everyone knows heat air<br>is a horrible heat transfer fluid we had<br>to take that heat transfer coefficient<br>from 10 to<br>100 factor of 10 and we had to do it at<br>very low air flows so uh that was that<br>was the data stream that that that was<br>in Industry that that the other<br>researchers around the World couldn't<br>hear we heard it and we spent a long<br>time in the University uh working out<br>how to do it um and and managed to<br>achieve a new technology because of it<br>um those are two of the points um next<br>time uh maybe we'll have another two<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
