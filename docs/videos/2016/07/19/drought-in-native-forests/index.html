drought-induced<br>forest mortality is a global phenomenon<br>that involves trees dying during dry<br>periods now recent research is showing<br>that this is an event that's increasing<br>in prevalence across the world because<br>as the climate changes extreme events<br>like throughout becoming more frequent<br>and also more severe so this has really<br>big impacts and consequences for our<br>biodiversity and conservation because as<br>you can imagine a dead forest doesn't<br>support a healthy ecosystem but there<br>are also consequences for the carbon and<br>water cycles because forests is so<br>important for capturing and storing<br>carbon and they also play a really vital<br>role in the cycling of water on a global<br>scale so this figure here that I've<br>shown comes from a recent paper which is<br>showing some of the research happening<br>to understand the global situation so<br>there's a lot of work going on to work<br>out can we predict which forests are<br>going to die and where and what sort of<br>factors make trees vulnerable to this<br>type of die back so this paper really<br>showed that the larger trees were more<br>vulnerable more vulnerable to die back<br>and so that there's there's lots of work<br>other things going on in this space but<br>what's the situation here in New Zealand<br>where you can see from this figure that<br>we do have a couple of instances of<br>forest I back that have been recorded in<br>the global literature and in fact when<br>we look at the local projections for our<br>climate into the future we do see that<br>strout's will become more severe so this<br>figure shows the percentage of time<br>let's say the percentage of extra time<br>spent in drought in certain parts of the<br>country in 60 or more years time and so<br>that dark red color shows areas that<br>will be spending more time in drought<br>and so this is something that could have<br>extensive effects across the country and<br>we need to understand whether this is a<br>conservation threat and what<br>impacts will be on our carbon budgets<br>and also our water availability so here<br>in New Zealand this is particularly<br>important because we have so many unique<br>ecosystems and species of our plant<br>species about eighty percent are found<br>nowhere else in the world so this means<br>that we really need to think about<br>conserving our species and that's where<br>the conservation threat comes in but we<br>also need to think about our water<br>availability so in a city like Auckland<br>that's growing rapidly we need to think<br>about whether we'll have enough water<br>available in the future and in our<br>forest attachments will a change in<br>climate affects the amount of water<br>available to us for human use so my<br>research has been ongoing looking at the<br>carbon and water cycles in calorie<br>forest so I chose to work on curry<br>because they're known to be responsive<br>to climatic conditions so the tree-ring<br>research that's been happening over a<br>number of decades here at the University<br>of Auckland and other places tells us<br>that curry are really do interact will<br>they respond to the climatic conditions<br>and so what I'm doing is trying to<br>understand the mechanistic processes or<br>the physiology behind those interactions<br>so by measuring the carbon and water<br>fluxes in the car reforest I'm trying to<br>understand what are the underlying<br>physiological processes going on here so<br>essentially what we do is we instrumenta<br>trees like Christmas treats and take all<br>sorts of different measurements to look<br>at what's happening in the real world<br>and then we can put that together with<br>climatic information source chur details<br>things like the evaporative demand of<br>the air air temperature sunlight and all<br>of these sorts of things and we can<br>develop these mechanistic models to<br>understand what is happening out in the<br>real world so do a combination of<br>fieldwork and modeling research so in my<br>marsden work I've been doing baseline<br>research to understand how the trees<br>respond to the natural conditions that<br>are happening in the world and so i'm<br>working at the hole by scientific<br>reserve which is one of the university's<br>pieces of land<br>for research so this is a patch of<br>remnant karu forest and as I said I've<br>instrumented the trees there and we were<br>lucky enough to catch the summer 2013<br>drought within that period so it was a<br>really nice natural experiment so this<br>figure at the top on the right here<br>shows the soil moisture and I've<br>highlighted that's dry period where you<br>can see the soil moisture declined<br>significantly during that time when<br>there was very little rainfall so we<br>could look at how the trees were<br>responding to those conditions and what<br>we saw was that in fact the trees had a<br>lot of adaptations that allow them to<br>cope with the dry conditions so this is<br>really great news so doing things like<br>shedding their leaves meant that they<br>could save water deep roots gave them<br>access to deep water stores they had<br>increased root biomass under drought and<br>they're able to close their leaf pores<br>also to save water and they also have<br>really fantastic stem water storage so<br>they have this reservoir of water that<br>they're naturally holding in their<br>trunks so we've found a lot of evidence<br>for really great adaptations to allow<br>curry trees in particular to survive<br>drought periods the next step though is<br>to understand well what happens if we<br>get subsequent droughts and what are the<br>thresholds to this survival because as<br>we all know any plant will eventually<br>die if we withhold water for long enough<br>and we want to know what that point of<br>death will be so this is my brother for<br>discovery fellowship work I'm conducting<br>a drought simulation experiment out in<br>the field again at the whole pie<br>scientific reserve and this approach is<br>known as a through fall exclusion<br>experiment and what it involves is<br>essentially catching rainfall before it<br>hits the forest floor to create drought<br>plots and so you can see in this<br>plantation we've got a nice layout of<br>neat rows to capture that water if this<br>is an approach that's been used at a<br>number of places around the world but<br>it's the first time to be done here in<br>New Zealand and because I don't have a<br>nice plantation it's a messy forest a<br>natural system taking quite a different<br>approach so at the moment just in the<br>planning phases here<br>but it's all about understanding what<br>are the carbon and water consequences of<br>ongoing and subsequent droughts and as<br>the droughts get more severe and it's<br>also about defining the mortality<br>threshold of the current trees I just<br>want to conclude with a plug for the<br>research reserve so I've mentioned that<br>I do my work at the hula pie scientific<br>reserve there are several other reserves<br>that the university owns and these are<br>being essential for my research and<br>other ecological type studies but<br>there's the potential to do lots of<br>other work in this these resources so if<br>you want to find out more about the<br>reserves if you search reserves on the<br>University of Auckland website it will<br>take you to this home page and you can<br>look at other details of the different<br>reserves and there's a nice little video<br>about the reserves in the work that's<br>happening there and finally I have two<br>PhD scholarships available I suspect not<br>many people in the room are in the<br>market looking for a PhD scholarship but<br>I am interested in talking to students<br>from other parts of science of physics<br>and chemistry so if you know of any<br>students looking for a scholarship<br>please ask them to get in touch thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
