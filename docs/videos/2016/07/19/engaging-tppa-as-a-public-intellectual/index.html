Research Excellence Forum.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um gosh can't really see people here so<br>I'll talk into the into The Ether um I<br>want to reflect a bit on our incredibly<br>privileged job as academics and how we<br>can use that to perform both our role<br>and our responsibilities as public<br>intellectuals and many of the people<br>who've spoken today uh are exemplars of<br>that uh I want to focus in<br>particular on uh the work that we've<br>been doing for the last six years around<br>and talk in particular about the<br>problems of how you perform that<br>secret um when I say secret I mean that<br>when the negotiations began there was a<br>decision made by the 12 countries to the<br>trans-pacific partnership agreement that<br>no documents will be released until four<br>years after the agreement comes into<br>Force which is at least four years from<br>now and so that means trying to generate<br>a public debate around what is happening<br>in a really important set of<br>negotiations when there isn't any<br>information available was a challenge<br>and so when I was thinking about how to<br>describe this um I identified four steps<br>one was discover the second was<br>decode because it's highly technical<br>stuff third was demystify so that people<br>felt able to engage<br>with the concepts and fourthly<br>democratize so that people could have a<br>say in what was being<br>negotiated uh and I'd like to just focus<br>in particular on the how because I think<br>it raises some questions about<br>Innovative steps that we can take as<br>academics using the kind of access roots<br>that we<br>have the first step was to consciously<br>create<br>spaces if this was a closed<br>negotiation how did we<br>generate enough debate to achieve what I<br>set as the initial goal of us setting<br>the terms of the debate in the void that<br>was there so that the government would<br>be forced to come out and defend and<br>explain what it was<br>doing we started by uh creating the<br>spaces through uh an FDF Grant to fund a<br>round table and the round table brought<br>together experts from Australia and New<br>Zealand on previous agreements that were<br>likely to feed into what was on the<br>table in this<br>negotiation and I had 12 people come uh<br>all of whom prepared short papers but<br>with a commitment to Preparing longer<br>papers<br>that would then form an edited book so<br>the Roundtable was funded by an fidf<br>Grant I had a researcher as part of that<br>Grant who trolled as much information as<br>possible and set up a website so that we<br>had a database website media coverage<br>and so on that could start to provide a<br>repository of information for<br>people the book uh was turned around<br>within three and a half months months<br>thanks to my wonderfully committed<br>publisher Bridget Williams books uh<br>along with a subvention from the law<br>Foundation whose role is a a commitment<br>to having public debate around legal<br>issues um not taking any partisan role<br>but to try to to generate a<br>debate that book of essays was published<br>and we brought over Lori Wallock who is<br>uh one of the uh most prominent voice in<br>the US and we did a lecture<br>tour we did public launches uh and<br>lectures in ockland in Wellington in<br>Christ Church in denen spoke at a<br>conference at Parliament set up media<br>conferences and so on and that generated<br>a real<br>engagement with this as a serious<br>academic issue and not just a bunch of<br>NOS waving the anti-globalization<br>banner as a result of that the media<br>became informed and engaged so creating<br>spaces was a first step a second step<br>was using<br>spaces one of the things that we did was<br>to shame governments about the secrecy<br>of the process people don't like<br>secrecy and so we forced the governments<br>into in each of the rounds they were<br>holding different countries hold a<br>stakeholder event where people could go<br>and present their views to the<br>negotiators through that the negotiators<br>were exposed to analyses that they<br>actually realized were quite<br>useful and so relationships then started<br>to be built with negotiators not with<br>the New Zealand ones but ones from other<br>countries<br>and that then led to once the<br>negotiations went underground which they<br>did about halfway through when they<br>stopped holding the stakeholder<br>processes because they were being a bit<br>too<br>effective about five of us continued to<br>go and hang around and talk to<br>negotiators and influence the process do<br>technical work for them and so on in<br>addition to that we use the official<br>Information Act and other networks to be<br>able to try to secure information<br>constantly upskilling<br>constituencies such as the media<br>politicians other constitu IES coming on<br>board like the doctors the doctors<br>forming a group of doctors for healthy<br>trade lawyers coming out and signing uh<br>a letter saying they didn't support<br>offshore tribunals that would bypass our<br>courts in in dealing with foreign<br>investors rights other forms of Outreach<br>that we developed over<br>time the law Foundation funded me to go<br>to many of these uh rounds because I<br>could would then come back write op-eds<br>for the herald do other Media stuff to<br>get information out there that wasn't<br>otherwise going to be there and the New<br>Zealand Herald has always run these<br>stories because there is no other source<br>available we took a court case on the<br>official Information Act Mai took AA<br>claim to the white Tangy tribunal all of<br>that has set a platform of understanding<br>and awareness for the next round of<br>negotiations that begin next week in Sky<br>City for a China Le alternative to the<br>trans-pacific partnership<br>agreement also in<br>secret so what we've done and now we<br>forced those negotiations open and we<br>will use the platform that's being<br>created through this mechanism for<br>ongoing debates thankfully and my last<br>point is that the um not only has the<br>university been very supportive of this<br>but the mden fund has granted me another<br>maren Grant to look at strategies and<br>options for exiting these agreements<br>because many countries are currently in<br>the process of finding conflicts between<br>things they need to do and the<br>agreements that have been signed that<br>lock the door on them and so it it shows<br>that you can be a dissident you can be a<br>public intellectual but you've got to be<br>creative about how you create the spaces<br>and opportunities to do<br>so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
