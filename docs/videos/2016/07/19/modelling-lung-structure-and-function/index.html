accurate.</p><p>thank you for that introduction uh so<br>yes I'm going to Enlighten you a little<br>bit about modeling lung structure and<br>function uh this is going to be a very<br>quick journey through uh some of my<br>group's research um a journey from basic<br>science Discovery through applied<br>through to clinical research and back<br>again uh and it's also a um a<br>multi-disciplinary journey and uh a lot<br>of international<br>elaborations so first the first thing in<br>this title uh modeling lung<br>structure so we start with a can we<br>question so can we use mathematical<br>algorithms um to simulate the anatomical<br>structure of the lungs so the Airways<br>the blood vessels um the lung surface um<br>topology uh the answer is yes uh<br>fortunately um so what you see here is a<br>mathematical model model of one human<br>conducting Airway tree generated using<br>an individual's um Medical Imaging so<br>computed tomography uh we use the these<br>tree creating algorithms volume filling<br>branching algorithms um to create the<br>tree geometry now why does that end up<br>being important well we know that there<br>are significant um differences between<br>species in terms of this branching<br>geometry but if you're thinking about<br>drug Discovery drug development<br>uh trials initially animal trials um if<br>you are testing your your drug<br>dispersion in a very different geometry<br>to what you are hoping it's going to end<br>up in which is human uh then you can you<br>can end up with uh results that don't<br>get translated well to human physiology<br>that's just one of the<br>purposes once we have structure we then<br>want to think about function now in the<br>lung as in any biological organ<br>structure and function are intimately uh<br>related to each other uh when we have uh<br>lung disease we are typically getting a<br>change to structure which affects<br>function so we would like to understand<br>how these things are related to each<br>other and how we can exploit<br>understanding of structure function<br>interactions to come up with better<br>methods for diagnosis and uh for<br>treatment of lung disease so we've<br>developed um methods to simulate how the<br>lung tissue deforms under Gravity and<br>then linking that to simulations of<br>ventilation distribution in the lung so<br>when you breathe in the air doesn't go<br>uniformly everywhere in your lung it<br>depends on your posture so with you're<br>upright lying on your back lying on your<br>stomach the air distribution is<br>different and as you age which I'll<br>touch on later there are further<br>significant<br>differences um so we've developed models<br>that go from the very complicated<br>through to more simplistic methods that<br>we can use sort of at the bedside side<br>uh rapid methods to simulate ventilation<br>distribution along with that we also<br>need to understand where the blood goes<br>in the lungs so you don't get gas<br>exchange if you don't bring air into<br>close contact with blood um so we have<br>developed uh models so these are one of<br>a kind uh models that simulate from the<br>right ventricle through the entire<br>pulmonary circulation and including the<br>recruitable capillary beds and Back<br>Again to um the left atrium so these<br>models include all of the significant<br>mechanisms that affect the<br>characteristic distribution of blood in<br>the lung so again affected by gravity<br>affected by structure um affected by the<br>recruitment of these capillaries you<br>don't always have blood th flowing<br>through all of your<br>capillaries so once we put these things<br>together ventilation distribution and<br>perfusion distribution we can then<br>simulate gas exchange so this is<br>occurring at approximately 32,000 little<br>individual gas exchange units in your<br>lung and we simulate that at that level<br>of detail the variability that we<br>predict and that we know is present uh<br>anatomically physiologically sorry um is<br>really important uh the the variability<br>uh that that's present at Baseline and<br>then when we start to Overlay additional<br>aging or<br>pathology so let's look at just one way<br>in which we've used this um so this work<br>um I should acknowledge Alice Clark who<br>was a postto with me on an HRC Grant a<br>few years ago so this is using our model<br>so now we have this ability to simulate<br>the tissue deformation ventilation<br>distribution blood distribution and gas<br>exchange throughout the landine this<br>means we can then start to investigate<br>uh clinically relevant problems in this<br>C case acute pulmonary embolism or blood<br>clots in the lung so clots that are<br>preventing blood from getting to parts<br>of the lung tissue and therefore<br>preventing gas exchange occurring in<br>those bits of tissue so we can do um<br>computer simulations so we take uh<br>Imaging from individuals who have been<br>diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism<br>uh we then create a subject specific<br>model for that individual or group of<br>individuals in this case<br>why we were motivated to do this was to<br>understand why you can get people with<br>apparently the same clot load so<br>apparently the same amount of clot<br>blocking off bits of lung but they can<br>have very different clinical symptoms<br>this is important for stratifying<br>patients um for you know what sort of uh<br>treatment strategy should they get we<br>were from this work able to come up with<br>a potential new modelbased biomarker for<br>stratifying patients into these<br>different groups and um a radiological<br>scoring tool that Radiologists can use<br>to come up with a simple metric to<br>stratify patients uh and a surgical tool<br>so for being able to do virtual surgery<br>um to remove um sort of fibrotic mass in<br>patients who go on to develop a chronic<br>form of this<br>condition so this little journey I'm<br>talking about so we start off with just<br>some questions where there doesn't<br>appear to be any real specific applied<br>outcome um so how can we model how the<br>lung tissue deforms or can we model it<br>so being in a a sort of basic science<br>question this was supported by mden<br>which gave us the ability to develop the<br>basic model<br>framework then we go on to validation in<br>animals validation in humans applying<br>this model in patients who are<br>invasively or non-invasively<br>ventilated and then through<br>International connection<br>through to which we're looking at now<br>understanding how different types of<br>ventilation strategies can be optimized<br>uh to individuals to improve their<br>clinical outcomes another question what<br>happens to the lung as it gets older uh<br>lots of bad stuff I can tell you um so<br>an NIH subcontract first of all just to<br>develop a statistical model of the lung<br>uh and and then going on to reexamining<br>hypotheses uh for lung function now in<br>the framework of the older lung okay<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
