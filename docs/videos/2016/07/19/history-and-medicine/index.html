0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>opening The Forum this morning the VC<br>pointed out the importance of events<br>like this to Foster collaboration across<br>multiple sites and across traditional<br>boundaries and I would like to suggest<br>that those of us working in the<br>humanities and in history in particular<br>have a lot to offer scientific and<br>medical researchers specifically<br>providing the relevant social and<br>cultural context important in<br>understanding the big issues<br>as a doctoral student in the 1980s I<br>entered a new and exciting discipline<br>called the social history of medicine<br>which self-consciously sought to<br>position medicine within the society<br>from which it came as opposed the<br>antiquarian and celebratory accounts of<br>medical history that had dominated the<br>field to that point my first major work<br>was a social history of tuberculosis in<br>20th century Britain with a the strong<br>patient Focus you can see the patient on<br>the cover there concerned with<br>understanding the social reality behind<br>the romanticized view of this particular<br>disease as exemplified in perhaps Thomas<br>man's novel called The Magic<br>Mountain 20th century Western medicine<br>has sometimes been portrayed as<br>mechanistic or biomedical and I found<br>the medical responses to this particular<br>infectious disease markedly holistic<br>with a good dose of patient blaming and<br>exhortations to self-control and<br>moderation in all things this was used<br>in preventive campaigns as well as in<br>treatment<br>itself my career in the social history<br>of medicine led me down many Avenues<br>including Pediatrics and the iconic<br>sorry um plunket Society set up here in<br>New Zealand in<br>197 and also into maternal health the<br>latter led to a mden application just<br>over a decade ago for a project on<br>reproductive health history with a<br>special emphasis on New Zealand's<br>foremost Hospital in this area National<br>Women's Hospital and it was this project<br>for which I was granted one of the<br>inaugural University Research Awards in<br>1914 that um Diane<br>mentioned well this project gained me<br>some<br>notoriety as in the course of my<br>research I came to question the<br>conclusions of inquiry into the hospital<br>that had taken place in 1988 the<br>so-called cartright inquiry after judge<br>Sylvia cartright subsequently governor<br>general and um the vice Chancellor<br>Citation for my research award in 2014<br>focused spe specifically on this work<br>and public engagement and how it had as<br>Diane said changed understandings of our<br>medical history quote and as an<br>indication of its reception in the<br>scientific Community he cited one review<br>from Cambridge University Emeritus<br>professor of hematology Robin Carrol who<br>wrote of the book I quote it is a<br>chilling and gripping account read it<br>although the story relates to a crisis<br>in New Zealand it Bears a grim message<br>for all who Endeavor to Advance Medical<br>Science well what was that<br>message as a historian I do not seek to<br>be dactic more in my apologist for the<br>doctors of that hospital as I've<br>sometimes been accused rather I sought<br>to position the cartri inquiry into its<br>historical context we learn from medical<br>history that there is no one doctor's<br>point of view that treatment meth<br>methods are constantly in flux and<br>negotiated and the treatment of<br>carcinoma and siteu the subject of the<br>inquiry was no exception the 1980s was<br>also a particular point in time time<br>when consumerism was on the ascendant<br>and social relations in medicine were in<br>some quarters acrimonious it was this<br>constellation of factors an intersection<br>of different interest groups inside and<br>outside of medicine that brought about<br>this inquiry and gave it the huge public<br>profile it<br>had the inquiry Port itself has become<br>an iconic T text in certain sectors of<br>society and my dispassionate treat<br>of it as a historical document was not<br>well received by those who idolized it<br>from an interview with Kim Hull to many<br>public addresses this book really<br>touched a nerve ignited by a cover story<br>in The Listener at the time of<br>publication called at last the truth a<br>title by the way which I did not<br>choose the book also sparked an an<br>extended correspondence in the New<br>Zealand medical journal which included<br>no less than 40 three items over the<br>course of several months and I was<br>invited to write an extended guest<br>editorial in my second book emerging<br>from the mden grant which was the story<br>of the hospital more generally I also<br>analyzed power struggles between<br>different groups again doctors should<br>not be seen as a homogeneous group but<br>these power struggles and negotiations<br>that influenced medicine and the<br>hospital also included consum hum nurses<br>midwives and the government so this book<br>covered not only changes changing issues<br>in child birth practices but also<br>infertility Services as well as<br>contraception sterilization and<br>abortion it also investigated the rise<br>of neonatal and maternal fetal medicine<br>and ironically by the end of the century<br>when there was ever more medical<br>specialization and advanced technology<br>midwives became the primary caregivers<br>and child birth I investigated how this<br>situation arose helping I hope to<br>understand the present situation what<br>was most gratifying to me through my<br>career is that I have succeeded in<br>reaching out beyond the disciplinary<br>boundaries of History to a wi public and<br>the popular media reviews of my book<br>attest to the success impact I think we<br>call it a reviewer in the Press wrote of<br>my history of National Women's Hospital<br>I quote I'm really effusive in a review<br>but here I strongly recommend the price<br>of this book is minuscule in contrast to<br>the knowledge to be gained by anyone<br>even peripherally concerned with<br>medicine in general and Women's Health<br>in particular well that doesn't do much<br>for the royalties but the reviewer did<br>go on to say that this would text would<br>justifiably remain a medical and social<br>classic for many years to come so my<br>message then to you is that medicine<br>only exists in its social and cult<br>cultural context something which is not<br>always appreciated and as a little<br>footnote I just want to add to the<br>cocktail story and that is that um when<br>I was at the point of thinking about new<br>directions in my medical history<br>research I attended a university<br>cocktail party and happened to be<br>talking to Professor Andrew shelling of<br>the um Medical Faculty who said to me<br>you know there is someone should really<br>take a close look at National women<br>and so Professor Shing has a lot to<br>answer<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
