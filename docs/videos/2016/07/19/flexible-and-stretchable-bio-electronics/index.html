speaking<br>speak today so uh what I'm going to talk<br>about about today it's a relatively<br>Recent research um program in my group<br>on flexible and stretchable bio<br>electronics and it is thought that uh in<br>not so far future quite a few of the<br>diseases and chronic conditions will be<br>treated by uh bio Electronics so of<br>course um we already use electrical<br>stimuli to treat conditions like<br>Parkinson but uh here it's a a seam<br>summary schem from a recent paper that<br>actually summarizes uh what is in<br>development today across all range of<br>the biomedical applications for<br>stretchable and flexible Electronics<br>from all sorts of a wearable bio<br>Electronics in forms of the very thin<br>flexible um patches on the skin like a<br>plaster will will which will incorporate<br>sensors and some other devices to Tiny<br>implantable devices uh and conformal<br>devices for heart on the brain that will<br>treat all sorts of diseases like<br>epilepsy um so this is a research area<br>that is expanding very rapidly at the<br>moment and here I have just one of such<br>examples of on um integrated epidermal<br>electronic system systems which include<br>sorts of the sensors like a strain<br>sensors temperature sensors uh integ and<br>other electronic components integrated<br>onto flexible substrates that can be<br>used as a as a patches or temporary<br>tattoos on the skin for<br>example so in most of those examples<br>however the active electronic materials<br>that are used are still conventional<br>organic or semiconducting materials such<br>as silicon or gold electrodes and the<br>problem with that is that actually they<br>are increasingly rigid materials and<br>what they do now is they actually just<br>manufacture those materials in different<br>fashion for example by Ultra thinly<br>slicing silicons to make it conformal<br>and flexible and stretch and flexible or<br>making gold in all sort of um different<br>fabrication um techniques to like to<br>make it in wavy structures or Freckle<br>structures so that forms that so they<br>can actually stretch with the<br>stretchable substrates so in contrast to<br>that uh polymer bio Electronics it's<br>based on the organic conducting polymers<br>or sometimes called conducting plastic<br>materials that are a base today for all<br>sorts of thin film flexible Electronics<br>devices such as those transm transistors<br>or light emitting diodes shown here so<br>the properties of this material G is<br>that they can be actually reversibly<br>transformed from insulating to<br>electrically conducting States but also<br>more importantly the electrical Optical<br>and other properties can be actually<br>modulated or tuned by<br>chemistry um so this is where a research<br>of my group fits in um so basically we<br>are developing novel materials polymer<br>electronic materials that will hopefully<br>help to underpin this development in<br>polymer bio bio Electronics so the<br>vision here is to make materials that<br>are increasingly stretchable<br>self-healing adhesive and conducting so<br>basically all in one single polymeric<br>material so we hope to make them<br>multifunctional and also to make them on<br>such a way that they can be dissolved<br>and therefore solution processed making<br>them into very uh inexpensive<br>devices so uh conducting polymers are<br>usually confined to surfaces so we start<br>started with looking into uh into simly<br>responsive responsive bio interfaces<br>based on this materials uh because to uh<br>as as as a way of controlling the<br>interactions in between the bi molecules<br>or cells and surfaces so the idea is<br>quite simple one so we have those<br>materials on the surfaces and then we<br>actually modify them with this long<br>polymeric chains that can be respond<br>responsive to various stimuli or even<br>electrical stimuli generated by<br>conducting polymers themselves when they<br>will switch a surf switch switch their<br>conformation switch the shapes which<br>will make these materials to switch<br>electrical properties as well some other<br>properties or we can extend this Vision<br>further to actually functionalize those<br>uh what we call brushes molecular<br>brushes with signaling molecules to<br>cells so that we can uh we can talk to<br>cells and so on and we can also use this<br>idea of stimulating or switching<br>Behavior sorry it's not<br>working um on those brushes to actually<br>hide or or display this uh cell<br>signaling motives on the surfaces so<br>here it's some examples what what we<br>have achieved so far um we have actually<br>grafted all sorts of such molecular<br>brushes on conducting polymer surfaces<br>that are responsive to change in acidity<br>of the environment or salt<br>concentrations or temperature which in<br>turn um again switches the uh state of<br>those brushes and then in turn changes<br>the properties of the surfaces like<br>conductivity or um some other properties<br>of the surface so this is one exam one<br>sort one group of examples and then in<br>other for example we can change the<br>surface H H hydrophobicity by again<br>suitably designing those brushes so they<br>can switch upon um applying a very small<br>potential on the surface um so I have<br>had there one minute uh so we have done<br>a whole range of cell studies on such<br>surfaces which would show that we can<br>actually uh we can design compositions<br>of such brushes to actually make them<br>fully self adhesive or fully self<br>nonadhesive or self repellent and<br>anything in between or we can graph them<br>with the cell adhesive peptides to make<br>non nonadhesive substrates to again cell<br>adhesive substrates so this is just not<br>the surfaces we can make those materials<br>in all sorts of the other formats for<br>example we use a technique called<br>Electro spinning to make those uh<br>microfiber mates of those materials so<br>they're made on the of the rubber<br>Electro spinning Rubber and then coating<br>conducting polymer making them into such<br>um microfiber mates which currently we<br>exploring with the group in<br>collaboration with group at Harvard for<br>uh sensing the um simultaneous uh uh<br>beating of the heart<br>cells so we can make them hydrophilic<br>but again modify them with hydrophilic<br>brushes and U just I would like just<br>very briefly to show you actually that<br>we can make those materials<br>multifunctional and how we do this we<br>actually make them by using blocks which<br>where each block has carry different<br>functionality so for example we can have<br>a two blocks where one block will be<br>responsible to make material soluble<br>while other one would make it to talk to<br>the cells You by using these cell<br>adhesive peptides so we have made<br>actually whole range of such Lego blocks<br>and they are indeed soluble so we have<br>solution process them in such fiber<br>mates and we have shown that we can use<br>such substrate to to culture uh these<br>three types of the human cells so um<br>where we are heading uh from here it's<br>actually we would like to extend this<br>principle of grafting such materials to<br>make them adhesive and self-healing and<br>this is recently funded Marsen project<br>so we just couple of months into that<br>but we have some preliminary results<br>which were shown that we can actually<br>indeed graft adhesive brushes from the<br>photol luminent conjugated polymers in<br>this case making them a sticky and uh<br>and flexible and still photo luminescent<br>or we can make in first instance we made<br>um Blades of conducting polymers with<br>self-healing polymers where we show that<br>they can be uh of course conducting and<br>then after um cutting do phys physically<br>cutting those materials we can actually<br>self-heal them this is after after 30<br>minutes of self healing after which they<br>recover um great deal of the electrical<br>and mechanical properties so I think<br>that's all in summary we can conducting<br>polymers which can be used as Dynamic<br>bio interfaces tailor functionality<br>solution processable with designer<br>mechanical properties so we hope that<br>will open whole range of possibilities<br>in<br>bioelectronics and I'm really um uh very<br>grateful to my research group and whole<br>range of collaborators This research<br>area it's it's highly interdisciplinary<br>and we are looking to uh collaborate<br>more with biologists medical scientists<br>engineers and so on so if you're<br>interested please come to talk to me<br>about that thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
