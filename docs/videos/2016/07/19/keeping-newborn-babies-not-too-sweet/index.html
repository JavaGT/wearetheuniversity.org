areas of research in the<br>University I thought for today what I<br>would do is tell you a little bit about<br>an area of research that's occupied me<br>mostly over the last 10 years having<br>been originally trained as a<br>pediatrician and come to research rather<br>by<br>accident um a you a little bit about the<br>problem of low glucoses in newborn<br>babies um how the story of our research<br>has evolved over the last 10 years or so<br>and then a little bit about how it<br>really happened which isn't quite the<br>way one would normally present it so why<br>low glucoses and newborn babies because<br>they're really really<br>common and if the glucoses levels are<br>low enough for long enough in newborn<br>babies that can cause brain damage<br>because glucose is the major fuel for<br>the brain babies have big brains so if<br>you don't have enough glucose and you're<br>a baby you have a brain problem at least<br>that's the<br>principle what actually happens is that<br>babies go through this very Dynamic<br>period around the time they're born<br>because before birth they get a<br>continuous infusion of glucose across<br>the placenta from their mothers and<br>babies blood glucose levels are about<br>80% of mothers no matter what mothers go<br>up and down so to the<br>babies but with events happening around<br>around the time of birth glucose levels<br>go up with stress and you can see this<br>is around the time of birth there's a<br>very wide range and the levels are<br>generally<br>high and then somebody comes along and<br>cuts the<br>cord so you've stopped the supply of<br>glucose across from the mother glucose<br>consumption hasn't changed because the<br>brain still needs to work so glucose<br>levels fall and they fall very<br>dramatically reaching a low Point<br>somewhere around one to two hours of age<br>and then in most babies they get<br>themselves sorted out they stop<br>pretending they're a fetus they start to<br>make their own glucose indeed they start<br>to feed and glucose levels come back up<br>but they take two three sometimes four<br>days to get up to adult levels and in<br>the meantime some of them get into<br>trouble and this dotted line is a level<br>at which we often Define low glucose<br>levels and you can see a lot of babies<br>go down below that level for quite a<br>long<br>period<br>so the problem with low glucose in<br>babies is that you can't tell it's there<br>without doing a blood test babies can't<br>tell you they feel grotty they can't<br>tell you about their symptoms so you<br>have to measure blood glucose levels so<br>we end up measuring glucose levels in<br>lots and lots of babies in fact turns<br>out to be about a third of all births<br>are at risk of low glucose<br>levels and although we do that we don't<br>actually know for any individual baby<br>how low is too low for this baby<br>and so we end up treating babies at an<br>arbitrary threshold and we do think that<br>repeated or prolonged episodes might be<br>problematic and then we don't actually<br>know what to do when we treat them so<br>that we surveyed about 10 years ago all<br>units in Australia and New Zealand who<br>look after these babies and we said if<br>you have a baby like this or like this<br>what would you do and you can see that<br>there's all sorts of things people might<br>do which really means we don't know what<br>to do so everybody has their own view<br>including not treating them at<br>all so that Leed over a long period of<br>time to the Sugar Baby study led by<br>Deborah Harris who was a PhD student at<br>this University and we said could you<br>treat low glucose levels with dextrose<br>gel this is a high concentration sugar<br>gel rubbed into the baby's cheek and<br>would that be more effective than a<br>placebo gel with a feed in reversing low<br>glucose es and the short answer is it<br>was and in this trial which we published<br>at the end of 2013 you can see the<br>incidence of treatment failure glucose<br>not coming<br>up was substantially reduced in the<br>babies who got dextrose Gill and more<br>exciting the incidence of being admitted<br>to an innatal intensive care unit<br>needing to be separated from their<br>mother to have intravenous to have a<br>drip to treat their glucoses was<br>markedly decreased as was the rate of<br>formula feeding now the thing I was most<br>worried about is whether we would stuff<br>up breastfeeding by giving these babies<br>dextr Gill it was entirely possible that<br>the babies would think dextr gel was a<br>good idea and they didn't need to feed<br>and we would stuff up their<br>breastfeeding and that would be a bad<br>thing it didn't happen in fact we<br>improved<br>breastfeeding I thought very exciting<br>and I think what it did was simply<br>reverse the low sugars so it took the<br>pressure off the mothers the babies fed<br>better CU they felt better we didn't<br>admit them to intensive care so we<br>didn't separate the baby from the mother<br>and breastfeeding went much better very<br>exciting we were tremendously excited by<br>this finding we recommended that this<br>might be firstline treatment for this<br>group of<br>babies as I said we published it at the<br>end of 2013 it's now the middle of 2016<br>so 18 months later there are<br>Publications<br>Publications from different parts of the<br>world saying guess what they found the<br>same thing admission rates fell<br>breastfeeding rates<br>improved those of you know anything<br>about the slowness of Medical Practice<br>to change<br>anything will know how miraculous this<br>seems to me it's tremendously<br>exciting uh so with good evidence a<br>simple cheap effective treatment can be<br>introduced into practice quite quickly<br>and we found that perhaps the most<br>exciting part of that<br>study the other study I'd like to tell<br>you about is the child study and like<br>many good<br>researchers it started with a good<br>hypothesis that turned out to be totally<br>wrong so the straightforward hypothesis<br>was that the outcomes the development of<br>children at two ought to be related to<br>the severity duration and frequency of<br>low glucose concentrations in the<br>newborn<br>period was a perfectly reasonable<br>thought and we started the study because<br>we had over 600<br>children all born at w Cato As It<br>Happened who we had collected data on<br>carefully prospectively we' measured<br>them very accurately we looked after<br>them and we'd also included continuous<br>glucose monitoring which is not normally<br>used<br>clinically and that gives you a reading<br>every five minutes on what's happening<br>to the baby's glucose but that data was<br>not available to the clinicians because<br>you download the data at the end of the<br>monitoring period so it didn't change<br>what people did in practice they just<br>did their usual thing with monitoring<br>blood glucoses So within that study<br>there are babies who never got<br>hypoglycemic because they were at risk<br>and they didn't get low levels there<br>were those who did get low levels and<br>were treated and there was a smaller<br>number who got low levels that we didn't<br>know about because they were only<br>detected on the continuous monitors and<br>therefore were not<br>treated and we Ed these kids up and down<br>the country and we saw them all at 2<br>years and we said what was the<br>relationship between development at<br>two and glucose levels in the newborn<br>period and the short answer was there<br>wasn't<br>one told you it was a perfectly good<br>hypothesis that ruined by a bunch of<br>facts that happens to me a lot so there<br>is no relationship between these<br>outcomes these are the mean and 95%<br>confidence intervals and these measures<br>of performance act<br>two but undaunted and because we'd<br>extracted enough money from the NIH we<br>saw them all again at four and a<br>half which is a miracle in itself<br>because the HIC would never have funded<br>us to see them at 4 and a half and at 4<br>and a half there is a relationship and<br>there's a dose<br>response so here for example are the<br>different outcomes visual motor<br>difficulty executive function this is<br>related to<br>severity none mild severe none mild<br>severe<br>and the same is true of<br>frequency none one or two episodes three<br>or more<br>episodes so it turns out to my great<br>surprise that five years later the<br>hypothesis is in fact supported by the<br>data it's just a got stuffed up along<br>the way which is a good reason to hang<br>hang in there and to keep looking if you<br>think it ought to be<br>there and perhaps most alarming from a<br>clinical perspective was this finding at<br>two years the red ones are the children<br>who had some problem at two and the blue<br>ones are the children who didn't this is<br>the continuous monitoring data so<br>measures every five minutes over the<br>first 48 hours and what you see in all<br>children is the ones who ended up having<br>a problem at two actually had higher not<br>lower glucoses in the newborn<br>period and that was even more marked in<br>the babies who had low glucoses in the<br>newborn period so if you started low and<br>then went<br>High it did much worse in our<br>study that's quite important it's led to<br>me into all sorts of hot water because<br>the American Pediatric and endocrine<br>Society who are terribly powerful in<br>this area last year published a<br>recommendation that all newborn babies<br>should keep their glucoses above<br>four above<br>four after day<br>three and we're going um maybe not<br>it's an ongoing debate but it does show<br>the importance of the<br>discussion so what are we doing now<br>we're busy writing a new Grant<br>application of course we're always<br>writing new Grant applications but we<br>now really do think we should see these<br>children again and that the oldest one<br>turns nine at the end of this<br>year but of course nobody would give us<br>any money until we'd done the study and<br>shown there was something there to look<br>at so we're now aiming to look at them<br>at 9:<br>and we're writing the applications and<br>piling piloting the protocol because we<br>can't wait till we've got the money or<br>they'll be 10 by<br>then we're doing a trial of dextr gelf<br>to prevent low sugar levels if it works<br>to treat could it work to prevent those<br>changes and prevent that<br>damage we've doing a randomized trial of<br>implement implementation strategies how<br>do we get people to actually use<br>dextrose gel now we've shown it works<br>and that's been a very interesting<br>project about half of the units in New<br>Zealand are now using it and we're busy<br>trying to get that<br>up I've been co-opted onto International<br>steering groups where we might think<br>about doing a different trial as to what<br>level we should treat and we're going<br>opportunities in the commercial world<br>for other treatments in this area<br>because the Americans have woken up to<br>the fact that something is happening<br>down in New Zealand that might be useful<br>to them so all sorts of surprising<br>things come out of what started off as a<br>very simple question<br>how did it really<br>happen wasn't like that at all of<br>course it was an important problem<br>onethird of all babies getting a blood<br>test when we don't actually know how to<br>treat them or whether the treatment<br>makes a difference and I'd been<br>interested in it since I was a student<br>but I wouldn't have actually got into<br>this research at this time if I hadn't<br>had a very pushy Master's<br>student who having done her Masters kept<br>coming back saying I really want to do<br>my PhD<br>give me something that's interesting and<br>important clinically and I kept saying I<br>think you should work with somebody else<br>and I think you should come up with a<br>different BR and she kept coming back<br>until I eventually said well here's a<br>really big one if you really want to get<br>into this and it grew from<br>there um determination in the sense that<br>you can't wait till you've got the money<br>to start the study none of this wouldn't<br>have happened if we hadn't said all<br>right this is what we want to do we<br>better get on with it figure out a way<br>to do it and figure out how to get the<br>money and the people on the support<br>afterwards and I have time and time<br>again met people who say if I get the<br>study I think the only way to get it<br>done is to say we're going to do the<br>study where is the<br>money um when I wrote the application<br>for the funds to do the two-year<br>followup there were two areas where I<br>had not a clue I knew that I needed<br>somebody who knew how to do the detailed<br>analysis of the the continuous glucose<br>monitoring those every 5 minutes you end<br>up with many thousands of points and I<br>had not a clue how to do<br>that and all of the literature at the<br>time said that Vision was the thing that<br>was most affected by low glucose levels<br>and I had no idea how to Mission Vision<br>in twoy olds not many people do I have<br>to say but I didn't have a clue where to<br>start so I knew but i' already started<br>seeing the children and piloting the<br>study and writing the grant applications<br>and there were two things that made a<br>huge difference one was a stray<br>advertising Journal that crossed my desk<br>you will get them you know here's our<br>new Journal please read it and<br>subscribe and I picked it up on its way<br>to the rubbish bin I looked at the front<br>and it was a bioengineering journal and<br>it was a whole issue on continuous<br>glucose<br>monitoring so I looked through the table<br>of contents and one of the authors lived<br>in Christ church so I phoned him<br>up so that's how we got into continuous<br>glucose monitoring<br>not carefully planned the other was what<br>I call a reluctant cocktail party I went<br>to an event a drinks event at the<br>University somewhat reluctantly because<br>I was dvcr and I had to go and I wasn't<br>really that interested but I got talking<br>to this really interesting young man who<br>turned out to be a vision<br>scientist who got very excited about the<br>idea of measuring Vision in two-year<br>olds and developed all the methodology<br>that we used and is still collaborating<br>with us 10 years later<br>so don't avoid the cocktail parties and<br>do talk to<br>people it helped that I had contacts<br>around the world because I'd been going<br>International meetings for years I would<br>never have got the NIH Grant without<br>knowing people to know who to ask and<br>those International contacts are<br>terribly important and they're really<br>important over a long period of time you<br>never know quite how they're going to be<br>important this turned out to be useful<br>years after I met some of these people<br>and of course there's a fantastic team<br>we've now had more than 50 people<br>working on these projects over the last<br>10 years and I just get to come and talk<br>about it but they really do all the work<br>thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
