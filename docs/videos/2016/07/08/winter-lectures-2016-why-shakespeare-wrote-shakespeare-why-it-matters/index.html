rehearsing a new play every<br>fortnite how did they do it cognition in<br>the globe turns to the model of<br>distributed cognition drawing upon new<br>research in Psychology workplace studies<br>and philosophy to answer these questions<br>her lecture is entitled why Shakespeare<br>wrote Shakespeare and why it matters she<br>will examine recent debates about<br>Shakespeare's authorship and the plays<br>of the plays ascribed to him and will<br>show why it matters that they were<br>written by the man from Stratford ladies<br>and gentlemen Professor LAN<br>trible<br>Oto thank you thank you Professor Smith<br>introduction 400 years ago almost to the<br>day literary and Theatrical England<br>awoke to this terrible<br>news William Shakespeare playwright and<br>poet dead at<br>52 news of Shakespeare's Unexpected<br>death rocked Facebook and Twitter and<br>other social media Outlets Shakespeare's<br>long time friend ofy Ben Johnson's tweet<br>that Shakespeare was not of an age but<br>for all time immediately went viral well<br>not exactly the news of Shakespeare's<br>death in Stratford would have made its<br>way fairly rapidly to London but not<br>with the breathtaking speed in which<br>tributes to artists like David Boe or<br>Prince are tweeted out today so<br>accustomed are we to the wealth of<br>knowledge that we have about<br>contemporary writers and artists that<br>the information we have about<br>Shakespeare has seemed to some very<br>slender indeed although As I Shall show<br>the evidence is much richer than is<br>often acknowledged the one thing no<br>one's from Shakespeare's own time seems<br>to have doubted was his authorship of<br>the<br>plays the mistaken idea that there's<br>something suspicious or mysterious about<br>Shakespeare's authorship has wide<br>currency when I tell people I teach<br>Shakespeare I brace myself for the<br>inevitable question did Shakespeare<br>really write those<br>plays sometimes I'm tempted to give the<br>short answer<br>answer but but in fact<br>um while I'm sometimes asked this<br>question by people with an axe to grind<br>and I'll talk about that a bit more<br>later more commonly it reflects genuine<br>curiosity prompted by a vague sense that<br>there is a mystery to Shakespeare that<br>must be<br>explained now although I have heard this<br>question for well over two decades now<br>relatively recently it has gained a much<br>stronger foothold in popular<br>consciousness this is not only due to<br>the efficiency of the internet and<br>spreading false information but also to<br>the tireless efforts of a group that<br>calls themselves anti- stratfordians or<br>sometimes oxfordians but whom I prefer<br>to call anti-<br>shakespeareans back in 2011 Colombia<br>pictures even produced a film dedicated<br>to the proposition that Shakespeare was<br>a fraud directed by Roland emmerik and<br>starring talented actors such as Derek<br>jackaby and Mark Ryland this film fully<br>embraced the most outlandish version of<br>the idea that Shakespeare's plays were<br>not written by the man from Stratford<br>who is portrayed in the film as an<br>unlettered and opportunistic buffoon but<br>by the Earl of Oxford only an aristocrat<br>so The Story Goes could have produced<br>the works we now call<br>Shakespeare's perhaps few viewers of the<br>film accepted its full premise that the<br>Earl of Oxford was the bastard son of<br>Elizabeth I who wrote Midsummer's Night<br>Dream at the age of of nine before<br>himself having an incestuous affair with<br>the queen that produced the ear of<br>Southampton nevertheless the marketing<br>of the film leaves the distinct<br>impression that there is something fishy<br>about<br>Shakespeare so this evening I would like<br>to do two things first con convince you<br>that this impression is false that ample<br>evidence exists to link Shakespeare the<br>man from Stratford with his plays and<br>second to convince you that it matters I<br>should State at the outset that I'm not<br>going to engage with the arguments about<br>any particular alternative candidate<br>whether the Earl of Oxford Queen<br>Elizabeth John Florio Henry Neville<br>Francis Bacon or Christopher Marlo to<br>name a few the reason for this is simple<br>the case for Shakespeare's authorship is<br>so overwhelming that contrary arguments<br>do not achieve minimum plausibility that<br>is all alternative candidates are<br>equally<br>implausible so today I'm going to begin<br>with a bigger picture and for the next<br>few minutes just briefly outlin some of<br>the reasons that Scholars like myself<br>are persuaded that William Shakespeare<br>of Stratford authored the plays ascribed<br>to him now there's an ample amount of<br>documentary evidence that attests to<br>Shakespeare's life this is the parish<br>register that records the baptism on 26<br>April<br>1564 of gamus philus johannna<br>Shakespeare or in English William son of<br>John<br>Shakespeare we also have the bond<br>allowing Anne Hathaway and William<br>Shakespeare to marry on 27 November<br>1582 and the record of their daughter<br>Susanna's<br>baptism um him 6 months later on 26 May<br>1583 finally he the baptism of his twin<br>children Judith and hamnet on two<br>February<br>1585 as some of you may know sadly<br>hamnet died at the age of<br>11 now records such as these are the<br>routine documents of Parish life in the<br>16th century the vast majority of men<br>and women in this period died without<br>leaving much more than such traces now<br>while Shakespeare Left Behind little<br>that we would call personal his life as<br>playwright actor and businessman is more<br>fully<br>documented now following the birth of<br>the twins in 1585 however 7even years<br>pass before we have further information<br>about<br>him we can only speculate about what he<br>did between 15 5 and<br>1592 we do know he married very young at<br>the age of 18 25 was the normal age for<br>young men to marry at this age and for<br>young women as well and Hathaway was in<br>fact 25 7 years older than he they had a<br>child 6 months later and twins two years<br>on so Shakespeare would have been under<br>enormous pressure to provide for his<br>growing family our next piece of<br>evidence shows that he made his way to<br>London where opportunities for men in<br>his situ situation would have been<br>greater in 1592 we have our first<br>mention of Shakespeare that connects him<br>to both playing and writing now we don't<br>know how long he had been in London by<br>this time but it was long enough to<br>attract some Envy from established<br>writer Robert Green who published uh<br>this book Green's growth word of wit in<br>1592 it contains the following reference<br>to Shakespeare I'm showing you this in<br>the original black letter first but<br>here's a transcription<br>um that<br>reads for there is an upstart Crow<br>beautified with our feathers that with<br>his Tiger's heart wrapped in a player's<br>hide supposes he is well able to bombast<br>out a blank verse as the best of you and<br>being an absolute Johannes faak totem is<br>in his own conceit the only Shake scene<br>in a<br>country now green was an author and a<br>playwright himself and he here aligns<br>himself with established writers against<br>the upstart Crow beautified with our<br>feathers a johannas FTM or Jack of all<br>trade Shak scene is a player as well as<br>a writer the reference to Tiger's to um<br>a tiger's heart wrapped in a player's<br>hide is actually also a reference to the<br>line from three Henry VI 6 referring to<br>Queen Margaret oh Tiger's heart wrapped<br>in a woman's hide this is uh one of<br>Shakespeare's first hits in the emerging<br>genre of History plays<br>now years later after Green's death uh<br>Shakespeare actually gets his own back<br>at um at him um when ponus quotes<br>Hamlet's letters to ailia and one of<br>them reads the celestial and my soul's<br>Idol the beautified ofilia ponus breaks<br>off to note that's an ill phrase uh<br>beautified a vile phrase um um a very<br>vile<br>phrase<br>now another indication of Shakespeare's<br>growing reputation as a playright is<br>that we begin to see his name on the<br>title pages of some of his Works about<br>half of Shakespeare's plays were<br>published in his lifetime in separate<br>editions that we refer to as quos almost<br>no plays at all were published before<br>1594 by anyone not just by Shakespeare<br>and when they were author's names were<br>seldom connected to their play Tex which<br>instead were advertised with the name of<br>the company a synopsis of the play and<br>importantly where to buy them this is<br>Richard III as published in<br>1597 um where we get a plot summary his<br>treacherous plots against his brother<br>Clarence the pitiful murder of his uh<br>innocent nephews tyrannical usurpation<br>the whole course of his detested life<br>and most deserved death we have then<br>where it uh who who acted it the Lord<br>chamberlains his servants this was<br>Shakespeare's company and finally<br>importantly where to buy it which is in<br>St Paul's churchyard at the sign of the<br>angel in 1598 we have the first example<br>of a play that is actually Bears<br>Shakespeare's name on it this is L's<br>Labor's lost which is an earlier play<br>but is shown as now corrected and<br>augmented by W<br>Shakespeare the following year when R<br>Richard III is um is published again it<br>now Bears Shakespeare's name on the<br>title page and in 1608 Shakespeare's<br>King Lear gives him top billing Mr<br>William Shakespeare his true chronical<br>history title Pages were advertisements<br>extra copies were printed up and pl<br>pasted around town so what's on the<br>title Pages tells us something about how<br>sell towards the end of Shakespeare's<br>career um we also find additional<br>contemporary testimony to his position<br>as a writer and an author this is in Sir<br>John Davy's book The scorge of folly um<br>or satirical epigrams in honor of noble<br>persons and worthy friends here epigram<br>159 is dedicated to our English Terren<br>Mr William<br>Shakespeare uh some say Goodwill which I<br>in sport do sing hast thou not played<br>some kingly parts in sport thou haast<br>been a companion for a king So Terren of<br>course is is the famous Roman playwright<br>of humble birth and the epigram also<br>refers to Shakespeare's acting career<br>one of the few references to the types<br>of roles Shakespeare played he seems to<br>been known for playing older men<br>especially<br>Kings now the last um and clearest piece<br>of evidence of course um is the first<br>folio which many of you naturally will<br>have seen this appeared in 1623 7 years<br>after Shakespeare's death this<br>collection of his plays was edited and<br>seen through the Press by John hemings<br>and William Condell fellow Co actors and<br>business partners and sharers in the<br>company in which Shakespeare had worked<br>the Lord Chamberlain's men during El<br>Elizabeth's Reign and then uh James's<br>men or the King's Men uh after<br>16003 these men hemings and Condell were<br>mentioned in Shakespeare's will they<br>received Memorial rings from him in<br>their introduction to the expensive<br>volume they declare that it was produced<br>only to keep the memory of so worthy a<br>friend and fellow alive as was our<br>Shakespeare by Humble author of his<br>plays Johnson's famous poem to<br>Shakespeare's memory links him to<br>Stratford particularly the Avon<br>River all right so this is only a<br>portion of the evidence available but I<br>wanted to briefly set it out to show<br>that Shakespeare's authorship of the<br>plays is not an arbitrary belief but the<br>best reading of the available evidence<br>in fact there is more evidence linking<br>Shakespeare to the authorship of his<br>plays than is the case for any<br>contemporary playwright except for Ben<br>Johnson who was known to take a<br>particular interest in his own Works to<br>the extent of publishing his plays and<br>his and some of his poems in a a deluxe<br>collected Edition in<br>1616 this was seen as rather<br>presumptuous it was said that other men<br>wrote plays and Johnson<br>Works still this wealth of evidence<br>leaking Shakespeare to Stratford to the<br>plays to acting is often dismissed or<br>ascribed to a kind of massive coverup<br>designed to hide the true authors anti-<br>shakespeareans like to proliferate<br>reasons to doubt the evidence but really<br>the arguments come down to two we do not<br>have personal writing or play<br>manuscripts in Shakespeare's hand and<br>second a man of Shakespeare's background<br>and educational attainment is very<br>unlikely to have written the plays so<br>those are the two reasons that are often<br>preferred in different kinds of guises<br>so I'm going to start with the first of<br>these from Roland Emir the director who<br>brought you Independence Day The Day<br>After Tomorrow Godzilla and 2012 now<br>Shakespeare listen to this not a single<br>manuscript or poem was ever found in<br>William Shakespeare's handwriting not<br>even a letter and this from a man who is<br>known to have divided his time between<br>London and Stratford wouldn't that<br>normally have produced the vast amount<br>of Correspondence if you away from home<br>for so long maybe a little notes to his<br>wife asking how are the kids the largest<br>literary hunt in history produced not a<br>single handwritten note of William<br>right<br>all right so my first reaction on seeing<br>this clip was that's it your no letters<br>between an hathway and William<br>Shakespeare that's your first reason<br>what other possible educ explanation<br>could there be for the failure to find<br>ordinary correspondence between a<br>middle- class couple from 400 years ago<br>than a massive conspiracy to hide the<br>true<br>author but this point and the related<br>mystery that's often repeated that none<br>of his manuscripts survive um that Derek<br>Jack could be actually says that at the<br>beginning of this film are often<br>repeated and at first glance they seem<br>persuasive Shakespeare is our greatest<br>writer the reason reasoning goes so why<br>did he not preserve his manuscripts that<br>is his original or autograph manuscripts<br>of the plays as he composed them but the<br>argument turns out to be about as<br>convincing as saying well Shakespeare<br>did not appear on any talk shows to<br>promote his books so he couldn't have<br>been the real author it feels to<br>distinguish between what we would like<br>to know about the past and what material<br>traces have survived<br>survived so I'd like to pause here for a<br>minute and think how do we know anything<br>about the past especially how Ordinary<br>People and during his lifetime<br>Shakespeare was an ordinary person lived<br>their lives what items of material<br>culture survive what are destroyed as<br>the authors of an authoritative manual<br>on Elizabethan manuscripts write we may<br>start with the truism care will be taken<br>to preserve those things recognized at<br>the time as possessing value and only<br>those things then things wanted may be<br>lost through carelessness accident or<br>uncontrollable Decay things not wanted<br>May yet survive if they are not in the<br>way if they do not speedily Decay and if<br>no secondary values lead to their<br>destruction so this point raises um two<br>issues for Shakespeare's manuscripts<br>what value would have been placed on<br>shakespear's autographed manuscripts at<br>the time that is value because they were<br>his<br>manuscripts and uh what secondary values<br>might they have had that might have left<br>to their loss so first what value might<br>have been placed on his manuscripts at<br>the time first it's important to realize<br>that Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare when<br>he was Shakespeare or more to the point<br>he was in the process of becoming<br>Shakespeare that is most of the cultural<br>value placed upon his work now is a<br>product of his growing reputation over<br>the centuries let's not forget that he<br>made his money and worked in the<br>entertainment industry if we think about<br>a contemporary entertainment industry um<br>how many of you SE have seen a play in<br>the last seen a film in the last couple<br>of<br>months right how many remember um of<br>those how many remember the name of the<br>the title of the film everyone at how<br>many remember the main<br>actors the<br>director the<br>screenwriter um so for us um actors are<br>Salient the title directors May maybe if<br>you're really into Cinema and<br>screenwriters not at all as we've just<br>seen the name of the writer in this<br>period only gradually becomes important<br>and to be attached to the play and many<br>plays were um were printed without any<br>reference to the author at<br>all moreover the plays that are printed<br>were only a small fraction of those that<br>were performed and with almost no<br>exception if a play was not printed it<br>did not<br>survive if Shakespeare's fellows had not<br>sought out and collected and printed the<br>first folio 18 of his plays would almost<br>certainly have disappeared forever<br>amongst them 12th night McBeth Anthony<br>and Cleopatra and the Tempest generally<br>plays um only survive if they have been<br>printed so between 1567 and 1642 roughly<br>the period we're talking about it's been<br>estimated that perhaps 25 200 plays were<br>written 37 of which but more or less<br>were written by<br>Shakespeare um of the these<br>543 survive we have some um copy of them<br>and the rest are lost of those that are<br>lost we have some Trace at least of 700<br>um additional plays so lying behind each<br>of these 2500 plays that we think might<br>have been per um performed would have<br>been a chain of manuscripts the original<br>authorial draft an approved copy sent to<br>the master of rebels the official<br>responsible for licensing books the<br>prompt book with Sound and Music cues<br>and if we count all these multiple<br>copies together it's been estimated<br>there might be you know nearly over<br>12,000 manuscripts at one<br>point some in the playwright's hand most<br>of which written by professional scribes<br>of all of these<br>manuscripts um how many have survived<br>depending on how you count maybe 18<br>maybe<br>21 and of these almost none are in the<br>author's hand they're usually they're<br>done by professional scribes or they're<br>Pres presentation<br>copies um so as difficult as it may be<br>for us to accept authors of all kinds<br>not just playwrights viewed their<br>manuscripts as a in a utilitarian way a<br>sort of Passage um on the way to print<br>and performance and having no intrinsic<br>value at all so even a dramatist as<br>concerned with his legacy as Ben Johnson<br>did not preserve his manuscripts which<br>were seen as redundant once the work had<br>been preserved in print there is a<br>separate category of so-called scribal<br>public a of things that were meant to be<br>kept but um that doesn't really apply to<br>any of um to to dramatic text such as<br>this I can talk about that if anyone has<br>questions now in the first place the<br>statement that no play survive in<br>Shakespeare's hand is actually false and<br>there's one important and fascinating<br>exception that I'm going to describe um<br>in in a few moments but for now let's<br>think again about these manuscripts in<br>addition to the full manuscripts<br>produced of each play each of these 25<br>00 plays generated even more paper every<br>single part in the play was written out<br>for the actors because this was how they<br>learned their roles so if we use our<br>2500 figure and conservatively estimate<br>12 Parts through per play that's upwards<br>of 30,000 slips of paper and of these<br>guess one from a professional company<br>there are a couple of others that are<br>that are for amateurs this is the um<br>part of Orlando Furioso as written by a<br>professional scribe um for the great<br>English actor Edward Allen Edward Allen<br>was the star actor of the Lord Admiral's<br>men that performed many of Marlo's plays<br>it's estimated that Allen performed up<br>to 70 different parts in a three-year<br>period as part of a breathtakingly<br>challenging schedule in which companies<br>produced up to six different plays a<br>week as you heard in the introduction so<br>this left little time for group<br>rehearsal of the sort that's common<br>today rather players learn their lines<br>uh from documents like this that<br>contained only their own lines and cues<br>this is a transcription of what you see<br>over um in manuscript here the uh solid<br>lines represent somewhat the the Q the Q<br>or Edward Allen's Q is no answer um and<br>there are his actual lines um what you<br>don't know is who actually told you said<br>that gives you the Quee how long you<br>have between times you speak and so<br>forth but this was turned out to be an<br>extremely efficient way of learning your<br>lines I argue it's kind of information<br>underload um when you're performing that<br>many plays you don't really need to know<br>anything you don't need to<br>know but to go back to the question of<br>all this<br>paper and these 30,000 slips that have<br>disappeared we have to think ourselves<br>back into the culture of scarcity so the<br>manuscripts weren't valued for their<br>literary or historical um worth no one<br>thought they had any manuscripts meant<br>for the playhouse or the Press were<br>discarded after they performed that<br>function but they did have a strong<br>secondary value paper was expensive it<br>was useful desirable for many purposes<br>and had a ready cash value now this is<br>maybe a bit hard for us to grasp we are<br>a wash in a sea of paper clean white<br>paper is everywhere whenever I finish an<br>essay I dump reams of drafts into the<br>recycling but bucket but in shakes<br>England and Shakespeare's period paper<br>was very expensive it was made from<br>linen Rag and it was mostly imported<br>because linen was scarce in England<br>people mostly wore wool unmarked paper<br>was used solely for writing and printing<br>if you think about the cost of maybe a<br>very high quality sheet of watercolor<br>paper that's probably about about<br>right so this state of affairs actually<br>persists all the way into the 19th<br>century when paper starts to be made<br>from wood pulp so even an author like uh<br>Jane Austin there's a moment in North<br>aner Abbey where the child Catherine is<br>interested in drawing is described and<br>she draws whenever she can find the<br>outside of a letter from her mother or<br>some other odd piece of paper nobody<br>would ever give a child a blank white<br>piece of paper in that period it's too<br>expensive so used paper paper already<br>used for printing or for writing was<br>sought for um sought by bookbinders<br>Grocers and Bakers as there was no other<br>packaging material available the 18th<br>century Shakespeare editor Edmund Malone<br>stored some of his man scripts in a<br>Cupboard off his kitchen only to find<br>that the cook had used them to line<br>baking<br>trays so think about it this way if if<br>paper cost you $20 a sheet how much<br>would you use and if someone would pay<br>you $2 in cash for a used she sheet of<br>paper how much would you<br>save the vicisitudes of what is saved<br>and what's discarded is clear enough<br>really in our own time if you think<br>about the value of this this is his<br>first Superman comic published in June<br>1938 and he guesses as to what that<br>worth it uh in 2014 a pristine copy sold<br>for $3.2 million us so just have a look<br>around your house uh and it's worth this<br>much now precisely because no one<br>thought it had any value at the time<br>right it's cheap down Market trashy it's<br>liable to be read to death or pitched<br>out by tidying<br>mums those papers that have survived<br>tend to skew towards the upper end of<br>the social spectrum and that's not just<br>because arist the aristocracy had more<br>money for paper although of course they<br>did but also because they possessed<br>stable mechanisms of inheritance and<br>Residences they didn't shift house they<br>had money for chests rooms of storage<br>and to employ secretaries in fact the<br>reason we have that one part that I just<br>showed you um is because Edward Allen<br>had a sense of posterity and he sought<br>to memorialize his accomplishments in<br>wealth in the form of dich College which<br>he founded in 1619 this is um of course<br>still out this is a contemporary um<br>photo of it that I took a few years ago<br>when I was there um and this is Edward<br>Allen himself um among the items the<br>queed was the chest you see here I'm<br>sorry that's not that good a picture of<br>it um and in containing a treasure Trove<br>of Records about the Admirals men how<br>much money they took from each<br>performance documents about their<br>profitable bear baiting business<br>personal letters from Allan to his wife<br>Joan which were addressed as my good<br>sweetheart and loving Mouse and telling<br>her when to PL plant out the parsley and<br>the spinach this is just a sort of<br>document that we really wish could have<br>survived from Shakespeare's marriage and<br>that Emer thinks should have but the<br>survival of ordinary domestic<br>correspondence of this sort as opposed<br>to the correspondence of the elite is<br>extraordinarily rare and we literally<br>have it because it was in a tiny packet<br>put in that chest left um to dich<br>College in 1619 and the college is still<br>there that's why we have those um those<br>letters it's very very uncommon to have<br>Correspondence so in some to some of<br>this part of the talk the fact that the<br>manuscripts or the letters of<br>Shakespeare don't survive isn't unusual<br>it's absolutely what we'd<br>expect okay so I come now then to what<br>perhaps is a central tenant of the anti-<br>shakespeareans that Shakespeare statford<br>did not have the background to have<br>written the plays uh let Roland emmerik<br>make his case to you again sorry about<br>that no records prove that Shakespeare<br>ever attended the Stratford grammar<br>school yet the work of William<br>Shakespeare the writer shows extensive<br>knowledge of medicine astronomy art<br>music military law and philosophy as<br>well as aristocratic activities such as<br>Royal tennis and falconry call me a snar<br>but even if he was a Genus he couldn't<br>have pulled that one off without leaving<br>at least a trace of his learning after<br>all William Shakespeare had the largest<br>English vocabulary of any writer in<br>history not quite grammar school level I<br>would<br>say<br>okay so this is a fairly typical amalgam<br>of arguments used about Shakespeare's<br>education<br>anti- shakespeareans assert that the<br>plays reveal knowledge of the Courts of<br>noble households of foreign lands of<br>profession such as law and medicine that<br>only someone with direct experience<br>could possess now the claim actually<br>first I think exaggerates the extent of<br>Shakespeare's knowledge inflated claims<br>about his vocabulary and audition do him<br>no service I'll talk about this again<br>just at the very end uh he certainly did<br>not have a reputation for exceptional<br>classical learning in his own time now<br>now Shakespeare did have experience with<br>royalty and nobility at least from the<br>perspective as a of a performer at court<br>and in Noble houses even so his plays<br>are not particularly accurate<br>representations of the life of the great<br>nobility in Romeo and Juliet for<br>instance old Capulet runs around<br>ordering his servants to scrub the pans<br>light fires and set out the trenchers<br>behaving more like a provincial Burger<br>than a nobleman with a retinue of<br>hundreds of<br>servants Shakespeare's interest in Italy<br>was a part of a wider culture F cultural<br>fascination with the country and even so<br>the Italian settings of many of his<br>plays are often only superficially<br>realized and allw that inel a traveler<br>makes her way from Italy to France via<br>Spain his b knowledge of Law and<br>medicine is in keep keeping um is with<br>that of many of his<br>contemporaries and in any case there's a<br>well-known method to gain knowledge<br>about events one is not personally<br>experienced it is called reading<br>Shakespeare seems to have done rather a<br>lot of it and we should not forget what<br>a rich Place London was for gaining<br>knowledge by other means especially<br>conversation down on the docks in the<br>pubs in the<br>markets immer also repeats the argument<br>that there are no records that<br>Shakespeare attended the king's School<br>the grammar school at Stratford this is<br>true but there are no records that<br>anyone attended this school because<br>they've all been lost so his closing<br>steer about a grammar school education<br>grossly misrepresents the sort of<br>training young men received<br>there um in the Elizabethan period boys<br>were expected to enter grammar school<br>literate in English at about the age of<br>six they generally remained there until<br>16 or thereabouts teaching was entirely<br>in Latin and consisted of memorizing<br>Latin verses making speeches reading and<br>reciting classical literature writing<br>plays so this last point<br>brings me to the subtitle of my talk why<br>it matters at this point the question is<br>often asked what does it matter who<br>wrote the plays they're brilliant in<br>themselves and no matter who wrote them<br>we possess them and in one sense of<br>course this is true if new evidence came<br>to light tomorrow that Oxford indeed<br>wrote some of the plays and I would have<br>to have a very high bar to accept that<br>um say manuscripts of the plays we now<br>think of Shakespeare in Oxford's hand<br>account books a note from Johnson saying<br>the cover up was going well but my job<br>would go on more or less as it does now<br>except for having to revise this lecture<br>um I don't have a particular vested<br>interest in Shakespeare's authorship um<br>nor have I profited from what one anti-<br>Shakespearean wrote in an email to me<br>was the multi-billion dollar<br>Shakespearean industry so the people<br>really invested in Shakespeare's<br>biography might be the tourist industry<br>at Stratford upon Aon upon Avon but I do<br>want to persuade you that it does matter<br>and that it should matter to us as a<br>society because this is a story of<br>educational opportunity and cultural<br>infrastructure Shakespeare's story is a<br>story of the great things that can<br>happen to cultures that educate their<br>young<br>people Shakespeare was the product or<br>perhaps we should say byproduct of an<br>educational system that had at least<br>partial commitment to social Mobility<br>under Edward v 6 and then again under<br>Elizabeth the English grammar schools<br>were transformed and a national<br>curriculum set in place they were<br>founded in order to train the clergy one<br>of the first Central tenants of the<br>Protestant Reformation was the<br>importance of educated ministers who<br>could read the scripture explain it to<br>their flock and most importantly be able<br>to write and deliver compelling and<br>persuasive<br>sermons such education became the key to<br>social immobility now Early Educational<br>reformers were divided about whether<br>educ ation should be restricted to the<br>sons of gentlemen or to be made<br>available to those of the Lesser sort<br>the sons of Artisans and shopkeepers for<br>example in 1540 Archbishop cranmer made<br>a strong case for the latter course the<br>statistic uh poor men's childr he writes<br>are many times ued with more singular<br>Gifts of nature which are also the gifts<br>of God as eloquence memory apt<br>pronunciation sobriety and such like and<br>also commonly more apt to apply their<br>study than is a gentleman's son<br>delicately<br>educated what we call in the nowadays<br>the metrics bear this out in Oxford and<br>Cambridge the graduation rate of the<br>highest class of um young men attending<br>the fellow commoners uh hovered around<br>25% in contrast the scholarship students<br>such as Marlo were graduated at a rate<br>of 80% or<br>higher so they needed the education the<br>aristoc RS had their ticket punched<br>already um so it was this system that<br>created extraordinary opportunities for<br>Shakespeare and for others like him<br>Christopher Marlo um shown here in his<br>gloriousness um is um was a um uh was<br>the son of a Shoemaker and became a<br>scholarship student at Cambridge went to<br>the went to the grammar school in in<br>canterburry scholarship student at<br>Cambridge probably from there a<br>government spy and then one of the most<br>promising playwrights of his time until<br>his death in a Tavern brawl in<br>1594 Ben Johnson was the stepson of a<br>brick layer even lower down the social<br>scale poorly brought up as he says yet<br>became one of the best known classicists<br>playwrights and Poets of his<br>generation their backgrounds were<br>indistinguishable from that of<br>Shakespeare the son of a glov maker who<br>made his way to London by performing and<br>writing<br>plays now I don't want to overstate the<br>social Mobility on offer these<br>educational opportunities were not<br>universally available a plowman's son<br>from nearby Stratford probably would not<br>have been eligible for the grammar<br>school nor would Shakespeare's Sister as<br>Virginia wolf eloquently put it in her<br>counterhistory of Judith Shakespeare in<br>A Room of One's<br>Own but for those who could take<br>advantage of the opportunity social<br>Mobility was possible Shakespeare and<br>his contemporaries playwrights and Poets<br>were an un unintended and possibly<br>unwanted side effect of this educational<br>system because the very qualities that<br>trained good clergy produced excellent<br>poets dramatists pamphleteers hundreds<br>of aspiring young men with literary<br>skills and classical backgrounds moved<br>to London in search of work so the<br>legacy of Shakespeare and of his<br>contemporaries tells us of the<br>serendipities of educational opportunity<br>the unexpected outcomes that can result<br>from opportunities given to talented<br>young<br>people so I'd like to pause here for a<br>moment and give you and talk about one<br>example of the ways that Shakespeare's<br>work shows evidence of this kind of<br>training in rhetoric and persuasion that<br>he would have received at the grammar<br>school so one of the key skills taught<br>in school was AB ability to argue in<br>utum qu partum on either side of the<br>question a skill that would be familiar<br>to anyone trained in law Shakespeare's<br>plays are suffused with this technique<br>it is one of the reasons they're so open<br>and interrogative so restless and<br>inquiring the best known of such moments<br>of course is to be or not to be but I'd<br>like to explore another example of<br>Shakespeare's deployment of rhetorical<br>skill contained in a play that was not<br>published or performed until the 20th<br>century this is going to get us back to<br>that question of the missing manuscripts<br>so this is the book of Sir Thomas<br>Moore if you recall when I discussed the<br>scarcity of manuscripts I mentioned that<br>the manuscripts that lay behind publicly<br>performed or published work were very<br>rarely preserved once they performed<br>their function they were turned to<br>secondary uses like blinding books and<br>stopping mustard<br>pots for this reason many of the<br>manuscripts that do survive are those<br>that for one reason or another did not<br>make it onto the public stage and one of<br>these this one is almost certainly has a<br>scene written in Shakespeare's own hand<br>this um this handwriting is referred<br>refer to as handy um Sir Thomas Moore is<br>a play about the life of the great Sir<br>Thomas Moore that is written by multiple<br>play rights including Henry chedle<br>Anthony Munday and Thomas Decker and has<br>one scene that seems to be in<br>Shakespeare's handwriting uh<br>paleographers have um have argued that<br>it the handwriting here Bears enough<br>similarities a secretary hand to the<br>existing signatures of Shakespeare to be<br>virtually certain that it may well be in<br>his own own hand we could probably be<br>more certain if we had other other U<br>manuscript survivals besides signatures<br>signatures can be a little<br>idiosyncratic but that the handwriting<br>evidence combined with the evidence of<br>the way this sounds stylometric and I<br>think you'll be able to hear it too have<br>convinced many people that this is in<br>fact a Shakespeare autograph that is<br>written on Shakespeare's own hand now<br>all plays that were performed publicly<br>had to be licensed by the master of the<br>rebels Edmund tilney as I mentioned<br>earlier and this was to ensure that they<br>contain no sensitive religious or<br>political<br>content tilney refused to license this<br>play because it contained a scene of<br>insurrection the famous evil Mayday<br>1517 tyy wrote leave out the<br>Insurrection wholly and the cause<br>thereof and begin with Sir Thomas Moore<br>at the mayor's session um and and talk<br>about the Mutiny only by a short report<br>and not otherwise at your own perils you<br>could be thrown into jail um for refusal<br>to to follow this<br>direction<br>um so these riots that which he's<br>writing um pitted nativist English men<br>and women against European immigrants I<br>don't know if this sounds familiar to<br>anyone these immigrants um were thought<br>to speak strangely and to eat odd food<br>described here as strange roots and to<br>be stealing English jobs so the scene<br>that Shakespeare wrote is a is a scene<br>of insurrection of these native English<br>against<br>foreigners um and Shakespeare seems to<br>have been brought in as a kind of<br>specialist in Insurrection scenes that<br>were could be written in a way that was<br>palatable to those in Authority if you<br>think about Jack Cade and two Henry V 6<br>if you know that play but more more uh<br>familiar might be the riots and Julius<br>Caesar um written before this play and<br>then Cor elus later on these have a very<br>similar pattern a speaker attempts to<br>sway the giddy multitude common folk who<br>are shown to be blown about by every<br>word and to believe whatever they heard<br>most recently so in the scene I'm going<br>to show you a few lines from Sir Thomas<br>Moore tries to quell the riots a and ask<br>the the riers what they want they answer<br>we want the removing of the strangers<br>that is the immigrants which cannot<br>choose but much Advantage the poor<br>handicrafts of the city that is they are<br>taking our<br>jobs so more<br>replies all right think about this grant<br>them<br>removed imagine that you see The<br>Wretched strangers their babies at their<br>backs and their poor luggage plotting to<br>the ports and cost for transportation<br>and that you sit at Kings in your own<br>desires what did you got I'll tell you<br>you had taught how insolence and strong<br>hand should Prevail how order should be<br>quelled and by this pattern not one of<br>you should live an aged man for other<br>reans as their fancies wrought with the<br>self-same hand the self- reasons and<br>self-right would shark on you and men<br>like ravenous fishes would feed upon one<br>another so the argument here is that<br>once the rule of law is overthrown No<br>One Is Safe and he ask them to imagine<br>that this begins to sway the people they<br>say before God that's true his gospel<br>very similar to the kinds of things<br>people say in Julius Caesar um um in<br>fact there's actually a line that's<br>friends Masters countrymen in this in<br>this scene um so more then says let me<br>set up before your thoughts good friends<br>on supposition that is he asks them to<br>think on the other side of the question<br>to thinkk themselves into someone else's<br>shoes and this is the second Passage<br>passage you'll put down strangers<br>foreigners he said kill them cut their<br>throats possess their houses say now the<br>king should banish you whether would you<br>go go you to France or Flanders to any<br>German Province Spain or Portugal nay<br>anywhere that not adheres to England why<br>you must needs be strangers would you be<br>pleased to find a nation of such<br>barbarous temper wet their detested<br>knives against your throats spurn you<br>like dogs what would you think to be<br>used thus this is the stranger's case<br>and this your mountainous inh<br>Humanity so we have here in<br>Shakespeare's own hand and I think it<br>does sound like Shakespeare um a prime<br>example of the kind of imaginative<br>alchemy that great works of art can<br>Foster and that were trained in the very<br>ordinary Laboratories of the English<br>grammar<br>school further this play was not written<br>in some kind of Splendid isolation or<br>anonymity but was part of a<br>collaborative process and that brings me<br>to my final point that in addition to<br>being a tale of educational opportunity<br>Shakespeare's is also a story of<br>cultural<br>infrastructure so if Shakespeare had<br>been born in<br>1464 instead of<br>1564 he would not have been Shakespeare<br>however talented he was any more than<br>Shakespeare's mythical sister in wol<br>fiction could have gone to London and<br>become a playwright herself in 1464 and<br>the decades after the nation was<br>devastated by Civil War populations had<br>declined markedly because of the Black<br>Death there were no printing presses yet<br>in England there were no purpose-built<br>theaters there were few grammar schools<br>there was no thriving literary scene in<br>London but by 1564 and particularly by<br>1585 to 90 as Shakespeare was coming of<br>age matters had changed dramatically<br>London's population had soared a<br>thriving Book trade was in publishing an<br>unprecedent number of titles educated<br>young men were flocking to London to<br>make a living by their pens and their<br>wits and there were rival playhouses<br>dotted to the south and north of the<br>London City<br>walls in fact it is arguable though not<br>certain that Shakespeare's initial<br>opportunities in theater came through<br>something we might call Government<br>funding for the<br>Arts in<br>1583 Queen Elizabeth founded what we<br>might call an all blacks of the<br>theatrical World siphoning off the best<br>talent from other companies to form an<br>Allstar team to take the history of<br>England on the road this is from an<br>account book um authorizing money that<br>had been given to tyy uh to choose out a<br>company of players for her majesty so<br>this company was called the Queens man<br>and you can see this play the famous<br>victories of Henry V containing The<br>Honorable Battle of aenor as it was<br>played by the Queen's Majesty's players<br>this is not the play that you would you<br>recognize as Henry V this is a um a<br>shorter and um much more workmanlike<br>less artistic version of plays that<br>eventually became in Shakespeare's hand<br>uh Henry ivth part one Henry ivth part<br>two and Henry V so it's all in one in<br>this version um so we don't have direct<br>evidence that Shakespeare was involved<br>with the company but I rather think he<br>was they visited Stratford several times<br>and no fewer than six of Shakespeare's<br>plays are drawn directly from earlier<br>Queens men's histories in addition to<br>the ones I just mentioned there's<br>Richard III King John and a play called<br>King Lear l r all of these follow the<br>plot extremely closely but immensely<br>complicate the the um the way we see the<br>characters and of course have a much<br>richer and expressive vocabulary<br>so Shakespeare's life and<br>accomplishments I argue are much more<br>interesting and inspirational if we see<br>them against this bustling thrust<br>thrusting commercial world within which<br>he worked and within which he and others<br>were fostered we often use the term<br>genius to describe Shakespeare and<br>whilst in some ways this is no doubt<br>true it obscures as much as it reveals<br>indeed I would argue that the tendency<br>we see in the 19th century to begin to<br>idolize Shakespeare to hold him up as<br>unique and utterly transcending his own<br>time does him and us know<br>favors if you work at the folder<br>Shakespeare Library you might find<br>yourself sitting across from this<br>painting by George Romney the infant<br>Shakespeare attended by nature and the<br>passions um it's no accident that it<br>looks of course exactly like a nativity<br>scene and it's no coincidence that<br>around this time that the first doubts<br>begin to sound about Shakespeare's<br>authorship in the plays the play was was<br>was written around 1791 you're starting<br>to get these doubts coming in in the<br>19th century the idea of Shakespeare as<br>a deity come down from above doesn't<br>jive with the Practical business records<br>which are mostly what Shakespeare leaves<br>behind one reason I think perhaps for<br>some of the um beliefs that Shakespeare<br>did not write the plays that begin to<br>arise in the 19th and 20th century is<br>perhaps what we psychologists might call<br>cognitive dissonance or the difficulty<br>of holding two contradictory ideas in<br>your head at the same same time see if<br>you believe that Shakespeare represents<br>the unul Pinnacle of absolute witness<br>wisdom and virtue the Shakespeare your<br>in your head might be at odds with the<br>Shakespeare on paper and so then you can<br>either admit that the Shakespeare in<br>your head needs some revision or you can<br>argue away the Shakespeare on<br>paper so other misss get created amongst<br>them the nature The Narrative the<br>reclusive and secret Aristocrat but in<br>general that is not how literary works<br>are produced One thing that drives<br>literary production is simple the need<br>for money think about Charles Dickens<br>one of the things that the myth obscures<br>is the persistent and sheer hard work<br>that must have made up Shakespeare's<br>working life managing a business<br>learning lines and acting writing 37<br>plays over 20 years and probably having<br>a hand in others working with fellow<br>actors touring as is months on the road<br>performing at court keeping up with the<br>competitive environment of the London<br>theatrical world all the time all the<br>while dividing self between Stratford<br>and London for this reason my preferred<br>Shakespeare is a figure drawn by Lois<br>Potter in her recent biography the<br>Shakespeare that emerges from her work<br>is above all a Craftsman hardworking<br>with a good ear a capacious memory a<br>keen alertness to potential material<br>both through the books available to him<br>and through the thriving theatrical<br>scene in which he worked discussions of<br>Shakespeare might polarize against<br>inflated claims of his greatness and<br>iconoclastic debunkings of such myth<br>Shakespeare's much AED AED enormous<br>vocabulary might be a result as much of<br>his longevity as a writer in the number<br>of different subjects upon which he<br>wrote yet in an era in which many of his<br>contemporaries died young of violence<br>illness or and Piney otherwise sank into<br>Oblivion this productivity itself over<br>many years is<br>extraordinary Potter concludes by<br>suggesting that in the end it is<br>Shakespeare's theatrical in Instinct<br>that distinguishes him his plays show<br>his expertise in how to use suspense and<br>surprise how to orchestrate Vivid<br>characterizations and styles of speech<br>and how to give actors their<br>opportunities so the story of<br>Shakespeare I'm telling is not of a<br>Divine genius handed down from on high<br>instead Shakespeare was an ordinary man<br>of extraordinary talents fortunate<br>enough to be surrounded by other<br>talented men and women friendly and not<br>so friendly rival playhouses<br>extraordinary actors Like Richard<br>Burbage shown here um as well as um the<br>Clown SS William Kemp who would have<br>played B bottom and Armen who would have<br>played the fool and Lear and 12th Knight<br>Burbage was able to perform plays that<br>we think of as um being written for very<br>different ages and physical types Hamlet<br>aell King L and McBeth within about a<br>five-year<br>period so great artists I think need<br>Gardens in which to flourish and these<br>Gardens are planted and tended by others<br>by those that f f um fund the Arts by<br>those that support education by teachers<br>by entrepreneurs out to make a buck by<br>building theaters and printing shops by<br>long-forgotten veteran actors and<br>playwrights who may have passed along<br>some tricks of the trade from inferior<br>writers who nevertheless till the soil<br>from friends who lint books out from<br>strangers whose turns of phrase that<br>Shakespeare might well have picked up it<br>is this collaborative and competitive<br>world that allowed Shakespeare to<br>you well thank you very much Professor<br>trial I think um we'd all agree that was<br>very fascinating and inspiring<br>presentation of your work um you've<br>certainly convinced me that Shakespeare<br>was in fact Shakespeare I think you've<br>raised some interesting points around<br>archiving as well because there are<br>probably many people um in the arts and<br>in our day that you know could be in a<br>similar sort of situation and hundreds<br>of years time that might not receive the<br>recognition that they deserve today um<br>before inviting some questions I think<br>we'd all like to join me in<br>congratulating you and showing our<br>appreciation of your work to date and<br>sharing your time with us so thank you<br>than<br>you now I'd uh just like to invite some<br>question I think there's one back here<br>oh just wait for the microphone so<br>plays Shakespeare's plays a very good<br>theater yes and I'm struck that the<br>Czech playwright Marv wrote a lot of<br>plays in prison which didn't work when<br>they tried to play them so with the<br>exception of Marlo none of the other<br>people that mentioned have got any<br>evidence of having been on the<br>stage um or having worked on the stage<br>Johnson actually performed did it was<br>appar of the Alternatives oh I see<br>that's you're saying yes I'm sorry right<br>um and I just wondered if you could tell<br>us any anything about the process of<br>workshopping that that probably occurred<br>given he would have written text and<br>then it would have gone onto the the<br>group and then it would been<br>reworked y yeah thank you that's an<br>excellent question in fact it's one of<br>the things I'm I'm quite interested in<br>so just if we can imagine um<br>Shakespeare decides to write MC Beth<br>right the company needs to perform<br>something for James um who's the new<br>king they're now the king's servants and<br>they're think well what does Jame what<br>would James like well he's Scots we can<br>um uh we can work in this material about<br>Banquo um we know that he's really<br>interested in witchcraft uh this this<br>will be a great play so they send<br>Shakespeare off and he writes this play<br>up using the The Chronicles of Holland<br>shed that he used for many of his plays<br>so once he'd finished his draft we do<br>we're pretty sure that they the<br>playright um went to the pub with all<br>the actors and read it out loud to them<br>and we know that because Philip hinow in<br>his diary records money for um for these<br>occasions Bas you know entertainment<br>expenses um and so at that and at that<br>point the the playwright may may well<br>have sort of said how he thought it<br>ought to be performed um but in any case<br>if the company decided yes that looks<br>good the the Scribe then took the play<br>and made all of those um sides that I<br>was talking<br>about and so what I think seems to have<br>happened is that there was much less<br>group rehearsal and especially probably<br>less formative kind of discussion than<br>there might be in contemporary theater<br>and this is in part because of practical<br>matters that is if you're putting on as<br>I said up to six different plays a week<br>and you're putting up a new play every<br>fortnite you don't have a lot of time to<br>explore emotional memory or whatever the<br>kinds of things you might do in a in a<br>situation where you're maybe putting on<br>having a four to six weeks to to perform<br>a play um I think that so they primarily<br>would have used um their would have<br>learned their own<br>Parts actors would um like Burbage would<br>also um if you notice a lot of the plays<br>seem to be kind of between men and women<br>will have these sort of um dual<br>dialogues like Romeo and Juliet that's<br>also a way of thinking about the master<br>in his Apprentice so he'd be rehearsing<br>the boy at the same time or teaching the<br>boy at the same time he was learning his<br>own<br>lines it's thought that probably group<br>rehearsal would have been done primarily<br>for Fairly complicated plays uh scenes<br>like the banquet scene in MC Beth you<br>kind of need to make sure you've got the<br>entrances and exits right um and I think<br>you can see some revisions in<br>Shakespeare that seemed to be in part a<br>result of maybe something not working or<br>something not being heard quite<br>correctly um and so because anytime we<br>have more than one text of any of these<br>plays are always a little different and<br>sometimes a lot different so it<br>indicates that would have been changes<br>that might have happened between the<br>time it was adopted and the time it was<br>performed and then the time it was<br>printed um but I think your larger point<br>is a really good one I don't it's hard<br>for me to understand why for instance<br>really talented and skilled actors like<br>Derek jackaby think that it's impossible<br>for an actor to have written the plays I<br>find that baffling um but that because<br>they show I think so much evidence of<br>how you Stitch a play together um you<br>know where that you got to give your<br>characters a certain amount of time<br>before they change costume for instance<br>things like that entrances and exits all<br>of that kind of orchestration that<br>happens does that um answer a question<br>here were you going to speculate at all<br>on um uh how the actors coped with these<br>uh uh giant parts that they had to do<br>and uh just sort of thinking back to my<br>school days I remember Shakespeare being<br>used as um grammatical puzzles to make<br>sure we all understood how various<br>Clauses were strung together um so<br>you've got all that going on and um I'm<br>just sort of interested in the memory<br>aspect of it amongst the The Troop yeah<br>that's a great question um of course<br>apart from students who are become<br>actors or students who are studying<br>things like medicine the idea of<br>remembering memorizing things seem is<br>very alien to most of ours if students<br>if I ask my students to remember and<br>recite a a passage from Shakespeare they<br>act like I've told them to go to the<br>moon and bring me back a rock you know<br>they really find it hard to imagine that<br>they haven't got that kind of training<br>it's not the normal thing that's done<br>generally in education now but of course<br>so one answer is that people got very<br>very good at remembering um at at verbal<br>memorization just at school Shakespeare<br>is also my argument really is these<br>things are kind of distributed so you<br>write something that's memorable to be<br>to reme so that it can then be<br>remembered use the verse form and the<br>verse form allows you to give you a sort<br>of structure that even if you forget a<br>line or a word or two you can improvise<br>in a um in a way that's not even<br>noticeable for instance I don't know if<br>any of you have seen those you know<br>those BBC plays films that were done in<br>the 80s where they wanted to preserve<br>every sing Le word of Shakespeare um<br>they're kind of tedious a lot of them<br>but in any case there they are and<br>somebody went through and compared those<br>plays what the actors actually did<br>against the script and they found they<br>were Al they all constant mistakes but<br>no one picked them up it was like<br>referring it was like using the word<br>breath instead of death so it had the<br>same meter the same general meaning and<br>nobody noticed um so there's that and of<br>course now you know someone messes up to<br>be or not to be and everyone's got their<br>hand up you know we know what it's<br>supposed to be so there's I think some<br>element of what you might call fluent<br>forgetting the same time a lot of the<br>decisions that take up the time now in<br>rehearsal um especially blocking um<br>aren't needed in a environment where you<br>have um no lighting no or that is<br>ambient lighting um and where I think<br>there were shared codes of moving in<br>moving in and across the stage so some<br>of the things that again take a lot of<br>time to work out would be done as kind<br>of rules of thumb<br>um and so I think it was a whole range<br>of things across different um agents so<br>there'd be somebody who was actors were<br>in charge really of having their own<br>props and so forth but there'd be<br>someone who made sure the music cues<br>came on um and there I think just the<br>other thing is of course these companies<br>worked together for many many years and<br>they knew each other and some of the<br>work I've been doing now I think some of<br>their physical skills like fencing would<br>underpin some some of their verbal<br>skills like wittiness um you think about<br>Romeo and Juliet or sorry taming the<br>Shrew and Kate and petruo or queen queen<br>an and Richard there's a sense in which<br>those feel like swordplay encounters<br>they're verbal wit rather than physical<br>wit so I think all of those things kind<br>of underpinned this um and it was a Rel<br>and it was quite inefficient system um<br>but some of the things that take time<br>now didn't have to get done just because<br>the conditions were different you don't<br>have set you're not going to build<br>purpose-built sets you know and there's<br>a relatively fluid way of staging that<br>do thank you for that excellent talk uh<br>I'm rard theat and uh as a result of<br>your impending talk I read a few plays<br>some Reon I might add they really<br>marvelous uh from a psychological point<br>of view how he describes dreams and<br>guilt and and love it is very<br>interesting and uh it's a shame that<br>people have lost interest probably<br>because of the language barrier but I<br>think if it was translated into everyday<br>English I'm sure they would be read<br>again because they're so good really all<br>of them well I have to thank you and I<br>I'd have to put in a little plug for the<br>Shakespeare Globe Center New Zealand for<br>the for all the high school students who<br>put on performances um and it really is<br>through an abil through the not an<br>ability and study of it as performance<br>on the one hand they have that allows<br>them to try to get into that kind of<br>language so it can be done but you're<br>right these things um you know sadly of<br>course Shakespeare is not um required to<br>be read in school um and so some of the<br>ability to kind of manage that language<br>um has has eroded but I think the<br>enjoyment of Shakespeare and the sense<br>in which he can resonate with a diff<br>completely different time and place is<br>something that we do still see I mean we<br>saw a um t a production of uh Romeo and<br>Juliet translated into tongen at the uh<br>Festival on Queen's birthday weekend<br>so there's one<br>down<br>yep<br>thank you um I have a somewhat lighter<br>question okay I wasn't aware of this<br>film Anonymous that's was new to me<br>tonight um and I have recently seen the<br>film as many people here will have 400<br>years of Shakespeare done by the RSC MH<br>and my friends and I were discussing it<br>and the one person who wasn't in there<br>that we felt should have been was Derek<br>Jacky and I now wonder if that was the<br>rsc's<br>Revenge I don't no I I'm you know I'm<br>going to be at the world Shakespeare<br>Congress and I can see if I can ask my<br>spies you know if they have have any<br>ideas of course Mark Ryland who was the<br>you know Globe artistic director was a<br>very much of a what the same persuasion<br>and I think it's in both those cases<br>probably what I ascribed I describe it<br>to the what I was saying about the<br>Shakespeare in your head versus the<br>Shakespeare on the page that I think<br>they have this veneration that they just<br>couldn't can't square with the every day<br>but I still find it unfortunate I have<br>one of the things that strikes me is is<br>Shakespeare's Shar productivity given<br>that he had a pretty busy life y already<br>without a that and you can't help<br>wondering how it was that he he did it<br>all all um one one question is does how<br>does that compare with the other major<br>play rights of the day I mean were they<br>productive in the same region or was<br>Shakespeare genuinely special in that<br>regard second question is um would seem<br>that one way he did it was by borrowing<br>all over the place yes um we clearly<br>read the histories I hadn't realized<br>until your talk that he'd actually<br>stolen an effect plots or plays from<br>other<br>writers and improve them yes and in the<br>passage early on that was it some of<br>called Green rber GRE to be a hint that<br>Shakespeare was dressed in other<br>people's clothes or something so it<br>looks as though he was doing that right<br>from the beginning yes that right um<br>well that that that was that was the<br>implication of the charge actually<br>there's some evidence that Shakespeare<br>himself complained and there's a later<br>edition of that that disavows this idea<br>of Shakespeare possibly having um stolen<br>things but in the sense you know the<br>lines between stealing and um borrowing<br>are are always probably more fluid in<br>this period but yeah so one way he does<br>do it is I think is by looking at you<br>know using sources but then of course<br>most playwrights did the same thing the<br>question of his productivity compared to<br>others is an interesting one um he did<br>write more plays than Johnson but on the<br>other hand Johnson wrote quite a few<br>masks and poems as well the one<br>difference is that he wrote um unlike J<br>Johnson's tragedies were hissed off the<br>stage he couldn't write in that genre so<br>he had a certain form he was able to<br>write in but other forms that he wasn't<br>so Shakespeare I think is unique in<br>writing across genres and also in kind<br>of revising his work through time and<br>how he did I mean he must have just been<br>very disciplined like in the same way if<br>you read Anthony trop's biography it's<br>like this is a job you get up and you<br>you know you write from 9:00 a.m. to 11:<br>and you know there's no way to do these<br>kind of things especially over a long<br>period of time without having a um uh<br>without having that kind of discipline<br>he had a contemporary reputation at<br>least of a little just after his death<br>of being someone who didn't really like<br>to go out and party um Aubrey talks<br>about that he'd always send excuses um<br>and of course unlike Marlo he Marlo and<br>Johnson both killed people Johnson was<br>Johnson killed a fellow actor in a duel<br>and was almost executed for it so they<br>were very um mercurial people in fact um<br>my personal view is that mikio in Romeo<br>and Juliet is actually a um is an<br>embodiment of Marlo as well so there's a<br>sense in which he kind of plots on in<br>certain ways and he also I think is<br>constantly experimenting in fact his<br>later plays were not as successful as<br>those earlier plays I think in part<br>because he was kept pushing the envelope<br>I imagine the play the company saying<br>really troilus and cresa this is really<br>what you're doing because it was hissed<br>off the stage as well didn't he suffer<br>from verbal<br>diarrhea during the plague he kept<br>writing he just seemed to write the yeah<br>well I mean in the the earlier<br>um in the early plague years um that was<br>when he starts writing the sonnets and<br>so forth and that seems to be a bid<br>nobody knew at the time whether the<br>theaters would reopen so it was kind of<br>a bid for a different kind of way of<br>making his way in the world for<br>patronage that he seems to have<br>abandoned once he um once the theater's<br>reopened and the re the other thing<br>realizes the reason he was able to move<br>up in the world gain the social Mobility<br>is because he was a sharer in the<br>company he didn't make a lot of money<br>just writing one offs for plays um you<br>he made the money because he was a a he<br>was running a business essentially in<br>which he um contributed both writing and<br>here I was going to ask this before you<br>gave your last answer and maybe it's<br>mostly covered but where do the sonnets<br>fit in you're saying they were earlier<br>uh they seem to be the work of<br>a a very educated um a man of leisure<br>perhaps um and what is the market for<br>sonnets how how does that fit in with<br>the Rough and Tumble of writing plays<br>yeah that's a really interesting play<br>they're they're published in 16009 and<br>when I I mentioned the idea of scribal<br>publication so things like books of<br>sonnets my well have been circulating in<br>manuscript so that's an except that's a<br>different way of thinking about the<br>manuscript that the manuscript itself<br>was valuable and you circulated it among<br>people who you knew so my the best guess<br>1609 is very late for sonnet sequences<br>they had their Heyday in 1590s the best<br>guess is that many of these were written<br>and circulated probably in private um to<br>a smaller circle of friends in the um in<br>the 1590s and then later um and then<br>later published it's it seems to be a<br>bit of an amalgam um like there's one<br>sonnet in there the worst sonnet I think<br>is number 152 and that's the one that he<br>seems to have written to Anne Hathaway<br>um where he talks about he makes a pun<br>on haway and I kind of imagined her<br>saying oh you're going to put that Sonet<br>in there aren't you and he go okay fine<br>he puts it in towards the end so they<br>seem to be some of them seem to have all<br>been written at one time and of course<br>the sonnets are you know you can really<br>get into the rabbit hole talking about<br>this relationship between the sonnets<br>and the biography and that's just you<br>know I didn't want to touch that because<br>it's so there's so much work that's been<br>done on it and so much effort but a lot<br>of it involves trying to rearrange them<br>to make them fit a different narrative<br>and so forth there are quite unusual<br>there are not other sonnets that are um<br>addressed to a young man in the same way<br>that his are so it's very tempting to<br>speculate um biographically about them<br>but then the sequence itself was a<br>well-known literary form that might have<br>biographical gestures but were also had<br>well thank you all I said at the<br>beginning of the evening how much I love<br>being a professor at the University of<br>otago and one of the main reasons is<br>that I get to hang out with people like<br>ly the one question that was not asked<br>is who is that<br>guy and what is he<br>doing and I know what he's doing he's<br>throwing the hammer and I want to let<br>you know that one of the things that<br>Lynn does in addition to being a<br>remarkable Shakespearean scholar is<br>she's also a terrific Hammer thrower and<br>discus and shot putter I'd like to say<br>I'm a mediocre Hammer thrower but it's a<br>lot of fun thank you J thank you all so<br>much<br>thanks<br>than</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
