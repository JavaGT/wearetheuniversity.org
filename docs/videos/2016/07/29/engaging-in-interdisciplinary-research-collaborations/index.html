actually uh looking at<br>interdisciplinary collaborations as such<br>which perfectly fits with the day um and<br>I spent some time working on the ideas<br>and I give you a bit of a background how<br>I ended up where I am and what it is<br>that we're looking at or I looking at<br>and what does it lead to in terms of<br>questions maybe for the future um so<br>very quickly um when I was uh looking<br>for a job at the same time strad<br>University got something that translates<br>about 1.2 million New Zealand dollars<br>for three years to spend on facilitating<br>interdisciplinary research which is<br>great loads of money three years let's<br>do<br>it till somebody who later employed me<br>asked them a critical question what do<br>we me mean and what do we want to<br>actually<br>achieve put quite a few people in a spot<br>when they thought o we don't know now<br>what now this is where my job was<br>created at time and PhD that came out of<br>it and I spent about 20<br>months um researching but also assisting<br>the board following different groups of<br>people doing interdisciplinary<br>research different initiatives tweaking<br>poking changing trying to learn what it<br>is and what actually matters in the long<br>term but also of course to um Supply<br>some data for the board that could then<br>show to the founder that yes we achieved<br>we facilitated it whatever it was that<br>we to<br>facilitate and that led us to the first<br>question what and how do we Define<br>interdisciplinarity or disciplines um<br>it's a bit of a background we or I took<br>a perspective that comes originally from<br>sociology the practice perspective in<br>the crudest possibly way and I hope<br>nobody from the field from the field is<br>here who could later and tell me what<br>I've done practice us really explains<br>what legitimate in terms who we are what<br>we do but also how we learn all about<br>situated learning relational learning um<br>and being part of a community of<br>practice<br>y so this is the crudest way to explain<br>the perspective but that also means it<br>gives us a very neat and nice way to<br>explain the disciplines first of all<br>there are communities there are<br>tribes a bit like cultures that fight<br>with each other quite<br>often languages systems of values the<br>way you approach things the way you do<br>things for the reason you do them the<br>things that are legitimate in your<br>discipline basically Define who you are<br>as a scientist or researcher but that<br>also means uh or leads to the point that<br>communities are quite often in congruent<br>different methodologies different<br>languages different systems of values<br>don't go<br>together which led us to another<br>question I'm almost stealing the idea of<br>question which lead you to another<br>question to another question um what is<br>it then in terms of interdisciplinarity<br>doesn't mean there is another practice<br>that can be termed as interdisciplinary<br>and if so what is<br>it fortunately the answer was or at<br>least we think<br>yes and we ended up um with summarizing<br>and describing some of the the practices<br>and interdisciplinarity as actually a<br>set of complex practices that stuck on<br>each<br>other we grouped them at that time for<br>practices inquiry engagement enactment<br>there's a number of of of different ways<br>to um group them of course I'm not<br>saying this is the only way to think<br>about it um and some interesting<br>examples would be for example UPF<br>Framing and the Alan's presentation was<br>a perfect example of that and the way he<br>presented was very engaging for everyone<br>didn't matter which discipline you came<br>from<br>yeah the same for the problem so uh one<br>of the best examples we had was a NASA<br>guy comes to one of the workshop and<br>instead of saying well we need to<br>transport 50 Marines from base a to base<br>B and it needs to be done blah blah blah<br>he just said any ideas that can help us<br>to get a number of people from A to B<br>and we got musicians coming into this<br>session because they thought they've got<br>a solution and they had some good<br>ideas the other one which is really<br>interesting and we saw with some<br>established professors was asking stupid<br>questions sitting there knowing the<br>answer but just clarifying for<br>others and you probably all know that<br>pain from from the uh lecture room Jesus<br>this lies are terrible I can't see<br>anyone um when students don't get it but<br>don't ask a question yeah but we do the<br>same and the bigger the ego of the<br>professor the more often they didn't ask<br>the questions I'm not going to show I<br>don't know um those were the practices<br>that they were developing as we talked<br>or we we worked with the groups and we<br>started writing about them the second<br>interesting um idea that came out of it<br>is the emergence emergence of community<br>multidisciplinary interdisciplinary<br>communities this guy started working<br>across boundaries knowing each other<br>connecting to each other um there was<br>also a shift in the way we started<br>thinking about in the University about<br>interdisciplinary research is it about<br>solving a particular problem when we can<br>govern disciplines and scientists solve<br>the problem go back home or is it about<br>longevity was the project about<br>achieving actually long-term<br>collaborations not necessarily one<br>problem but thinking in<br>interdisciplinary ways different types<br>of support different type of<br>initiatives um is it about borrowing or<br>Co creating do I take your idea and just<br>apply it or do we actually sit down and<br>spend long long time trying to develop<br>something<br>together some interesting implications<br>I'm going to only give uh a few examples<br>less money was<br>better the more money we put on the<br>table for initiative out of the 600,000<br>pounds the worse the group was it<br>attracted some of people who were not<br>really interested in collaboration but<br>money less money was better for<br>nurturing spending time up front putting<br>different type of resource when people<br>could glue we also had a lot of of<br>dating speed dating and we called it<br>pre-marriage dating when we spend time<br>with groups making sure they<br>clicked and they developed the practices<br>so we know they're not going to fall<br>apart halfway through or they not<br>connected for three years like marriage<br>starts the<br>project side effect we developed a<br>number of reviewers and champions for<br>the<br>disciplines so they were then reviewing<br>the different projects because they knew<br>how to approach<br>it disciplinary oid are experts but<br>weren't the same it wasn't the star<br>scientist quite often who would engage<br>it was somebody else who probably wasn't<br>as accomplished as his colleagues in the<br>partner was much better at translating<br>the knowledge and bringing different<br>strings implication is promotion so<br>University changed at some point the way<br>they did APR and enabled them to get<br>promoted of course it's still the<br>question what do you do in the global<br>discipline<br>itself finally we developed a number of<br>courses which are still going so PhD<br>level course 10 credits um which we run<br>for three days with all the scientists<br>just talking through and explaining what<br>practices are um and stressing some of<br>the<br>reflexivity I will just finish here<br>because the time is up but there are<br>still questions that come and ideas that<br>could be explored and one of them we<br>just started talking about is is there a<br>space for a board game to actually teach<br>and engage students to get to the<br>problems in coron ide thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
