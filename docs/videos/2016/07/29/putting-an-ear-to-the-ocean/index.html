the day um it's been a I think a<br>a very kind of positive day I've<br>certainly really enjoyed um the the huge<br>breadth of material that's come across<br>um during the course of the day um and<br>what I want to do in my talk is kind of<br>abstract things a little bit I'll be<br>talking about putting an ear to the<br>ocean which was um the work for which we<br>got a research Excellence award from the<br>University last year but um I kind of<br>wanted to draw a little bit on um<br>something I've been doing over the last<br>three years which is writing a book<br>about<br>cerebellum um so as the introduction<br>said I'm kind of split between Marine<br>Science and center of brain research and<br>really interested in um evolution of the<br>brain and kind of at my career stage I<br>would certainly recommend and I think<br>there's there's a huge um benefit in in<br>trying to do some sort of synthetic<br>exercise and it's taken me kind of three<br>years to do that um and I think that<br>kind of synthes is given the kind of the<br>detail that we get into our research and<br>I guess one of the objectives of today<br>is to pull together people from kind of<br>different strands uh again to look at<br>those kind of synthetic issues and try<br>and draw some of this um stuff together<br>one of the experiences um of going<br>through the per writing this book about<br>the cerebellum and just to give you a<br>little bit of background the<br>cerebellum's the bit on the back of your<br>brain 10% of the volume but 80% of the<br>nerve cells in your brain um there's a<br>diagram uh kind of there of the the<br>cerebella wiring and and a kind of an<br>engineering diagram of how we think it<br>works and I'm not going to go into any<br>of that um and what it's responsible for<br>um is a lot of motor control um and<br>apologies to to ni row I don't think<br>he's kind of stayed but I would have had<br>a dancer here rather than um a uh a<br>snowboarder um if I'd kind of thought<br>about that ahead of time but what the<br>cerebellum does in relation to to motor<br>control um is it's part of that the<br>agency of how we do find motor control<br>and um this whole issue of purpose and<br>agency kind of what I'll run through the<br>other research program kind of what is<br>the purpose of what we're doing and what<br>what's the agency how do we make that<br>happen basically and just to give you an<br>idea of the importance of the cerebellum<br>in agency there's this idea of sense of<br>agency so one thing that the cerebellum<br>does is for every movement you make is<br>predicting what the sensory consequences<br>of that movement are and then the brain<br>Compares that prediction with what<br>happens and where those that comparison<br>is good that's what gives you your sense<br>of agency of how you interact with the<br>world so as I said I'll I'll just try<br>and um kind of run those ideas through<br>um This research program that we've been<br>running now since the beginning early um<br>2000s and I've put a timeline across<br>there um just with the Publications that<br>um are attributable to this program and<br>really th those come out of and I've<br>said there there's a search if you do a<br>search on myself and Jeffs and Craig<br>Radford and then edit that down to uh<br>the acoustic stuff those are the<br>Publications I'm representing there and<br>um just in terms of purpose um the idea<br>of kind of purpose is really the<br>questions that we ask um in the science<br>that we're doing and the question that<br>kind of got us kicked into gear in this<br>one was um a student has phone call out<br>of the blue aloa stutsky she had done a<br>PhD um James Cook University working um<br>on lizard Island and what she'd found<br>was that Laval fish and we're talking<br>about things smaller than zebra fish um<br>sort of 15 to 20 mm knew where the<br>island was that they were heading for<br>where they were going to settle<br>kilometers offshore and at night they'd<br>be swimming towards the island and the<br>question was how and given kind of my<br>interest over many years in in fish<br>sensory systems she'd kind of picked me<br>out of the phone book and and gave me a<br>call we talked about the various options<br>she wanted to to put an application try<br>and get a postto in that area and the<br>kind of two um areas that stood out to<br>us as kind of possibilities was one um<br>Acoustics could they actually hear the<br>reef um and Orient towards it and the<br>other one was based on the idea that uh<br>around isolated Islands there are<br>particular patterns of swell reflection<br>and refraction um and we know that it's<br>in the repertoire going back to an zon<br>talk this morning um of Polynesian<br>Navigators that they use these cues to<br>locate isolated island patches and that<br>seemed like a very marable idea so we<br>posed that question to to Maren do fish<br>love use the same cues as Polynesian<br>Navigators to make landfall and we were<br>successful um in getting that Grant it<br>always takes time Alona had a a real job<br>U by the time the money came through so<br>we recruited another postto guy called<br>Nick toer and so the first publication<br>that came out was um in 2000 and that's<br>the publication by Nick um and and quite<br>early into the project he found that<br>Acoustics look like a really promising<br>queue so it's fair to say that we kind<br>of dropped the um the swell refraction<br>um probably don't tell maren um and we<br>kind of went with the alternate<br>hypothesis so that's still an unanswered<br>question so somebody could repr propose<br>that to Maren and probably get it funded<br>again um so uh and kind of what I wanted<br>to represent across there is just the<br>the kind of idea of the way in which<br>that question has changed over the last<br>15 years so what Nick was able to show<br>was that the LV are orienting towards<br>replayed Reef sound and then the<br>questions come up so what's making the<br>sound what what's distinctive about the<br>reef and is the sound different for<br>different reefs so Andrew Jeffs kind of<br>joined the team he still had a lot of<br>the facilities um from from niwa bought<br>a a huge um kind of boost to to the<br>project as well um he put up another<br>maren a couple of years down the track<br>in terms of our marine ecosystem system<br>structured by sound again that was<br>funded and as part of that um we were<br>able to recruit um Craig Radford to a<br>PhD post PhD Craig um managed to<br>generate a maren fast start and again<br>sort of taking the question the next um<br>Step along so um if we know the um what<br>sound is being made on the reefs how far<br>does that travel out to<br>sea and so um Craig um addressed that<br>question and then his Rood was based<br>around the idea can we use passive<br>Acoustics to monitor ecosystems health<br>so that's kind of the idea of the um<br>progression of um questions and I've<br>just reflected um back on KL Popper's<br>statement about science begins with a<br>problem problems lead to guesses and<br>conjectures and if they're successful<br>this will lead um to new problems so<br>that's the idea there then very briefly<br>just the idea of agency and and kind of<br>generalizing it from the agency I was<br>talking about with respect to our own<br>motor systems the agency comes from the<br>people and the facilities so<br>interdiscipline we've heard about a lot<br>about today Chris Tindle was our kind of<br>physicist in the program and really kind<br>of kept us honest there in terms of the<br>facilities we've been extremely lucky to<br>have the um the Marine Lab and the<br>vessels and the staff there John Atkins<br>who was uh our um Electronics technici<br>in the course of this project has<br>developed some of the best um<br>cost-effective hydrophones you can get<br>anywhere in the world so we've been<br>extremely<br>lucky so just to to finish up um going<br>back to that idea of um trying to be<br>synthetic in the approach um if you look<br>at the um the impact and this is an<br>impact with um not non- capitals um<br>small letters but these are some of the<br>um the Publications the most side of<br>Publications out of this kind of body of<br>work obviously there's a science one<br>there with International collaborators<br>but two of the most cited um<br>Publications that we've had there um are<br>kind of reviews that we've written which<br>have kind of really established our kind<br>of place in this field as it's developed<br>and then gratifyingly the kind of third<br>most cited one there is is nict to's<br>kind of first paper which kicked all of<br>this<br>off so I just wanted to finish with this<br>this image talking about um purpose and<br>agency and we haven't got time to go<br>into the Providence of this this is a a<br>painting by Peter James Smith um of the<br>Antarctic it's Mount Discovery looking<br>from the um the pressure Bridges at<br>Scott base and um the tracks out through<br>there were our daily commu out to uh to<br>the fish Hut where we're doing the work<br>down there and it wasn't part of the<br>brief but I just think this is um a kind<br>of really nice kind of visual um<br>metaphor if you like for the ideas of<br>purpose and Agency Mount Discovery and<br>our commute to work on a daily basis<br>thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
