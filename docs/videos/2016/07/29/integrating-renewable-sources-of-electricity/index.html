the<br>energy center and I thought I'd just um<br>give you a sense of uh what we're about<br>in the energy center um the energy<br>center is very problem focused okay so<br>we like to approach so-called real world<br>problems U we like to inform um our<br>outputs uh with with good uh good<br>research and importantly um it's<br>cross-disciplinary so every research<br>project that I've been involed D and<br>since being director of the energy<br>center has involved uh cross disciplines<br>so they'll they'll come from engineering<br>science Arts uh and actually Nick ey um<br>some years ago too so it's very<br>cross-disciplinary that's what spins my<br>wheels gets me out of bed in the morning<br>um and what we try to do we try to<br>inspire um first of all and we do that<br>through our Publications obviously um<br>and we run a summer school on energy<br>economics that's open uh for a week uh<br>no charge to anybody that's interested<br>in energy involve people cross<br>disciplinary try to influence um um the<br>uh the community public policy and so on<br>and impact um that's the hardest thing<br>as most of us researchers know is<br>actually describing the impact of your<br>research but that's basically the um<br>what we try to do I just want to mention<br>uh talk very briefly about um Renewables<br>the work that we're doing on Renewables<br>the New Zealand government set a target<br>of 90% by 2025 here currently it's<br>sitting around 80% and you can see that<br>most of our most of our um electricity<br>is generated by Hydro resources uh and<br>we are very fortunate in New Zealand in<br>having a hydro Legacy a lot of this<br>development occurred in the 1960s<br>1970s is the is the 90% feasible yes it<br>is um our research has shown that um<br>it's quite feasible to to um to hit the<br>target of 90% Renewables by 2025 and<br>this will come primarily from geothermal<br>um wind and solar developments and of<br>course um hydro which is um already uh<br>in place we will not see much large<br>scale Hydro development um in New<br>Zealand in the future<br>here turning to wind and hydro this was<br>a a problem that the New Zealand wind<br>Association asked us to have a look at<br>and basically um given that we have a<br>high dependency on hydro the interesting<br>question is whether or not there is some<br>kind of correlation between when the<br>wind is blowing um New Zealand has one<br>of the best wind resources in the world<br>our load factors are around 45% so<br>they're generating electricity about 45%<br>of the time the problem that we have in<br>New Zealand is that typically when the<br>wind is blowing the water is not flowing<br>into our hydros so it's not an ideal um<br>an ideal<br>situation here the other interesting I'm<br>sorry with I've<br>looks as though I made a bit of a mess<br>of that slide there but does wind wind<br>is wind is a lowcost source of<br>electricity and so the interesting<br>question then is does um wind generated<br>electricity have a depressing impact or<br>effect on the wholesale price of of<br>electricity and if you look at these<br>these images here you can see here so if<br>you can't read that that is that is a<br>grid the injection price the wholesale<br>price of electricity here and the green<br>one is the wind generation so when the<br>wind is blowing um here our injection<br>our prices at the nodes throughout New<br>Zealand are low and that's what we see<br>um throughout the country so when the<br>when these wind farms are pumping<br>electricity into the system here um<br>typically prices are relatively lower<br>and when the wind is not blowing you can<br>see the opposite effect here you get<br>spikes and electricity prices um and so<br>so the answer to that question is yes um<br>by generation typ we see these all<br>statistical levels of significance here<br>wind keeps um a negative impact on price<br>Hydro uh and thermal plants as you'd<br>expect thermal coal previously and and<br>gas here that's going to put upward<br>significant<br>okay and the other interesting question<br>they had was whether or the whether or<br>not these um these nodes are are<br>connected to one another they're<br>obviously connected but does wind<br>entering um at one particular node have<br>a a spillover effect on other nodes<br>throughout throughout the country and<br>we're able to um um address that<br>question yet um directly there using um<br>econometric techniques and it raises the<br>question of where are the best sites uh<br>for locating our wind<br>farms a more recent study that that<br>we've just initiated is looking at the<br>solar potential for for Oakland City and<br>we collaborated with Orland um Orland<br>Council to get their liar data there um<br>which is so you've got um impulses that<br>come down um from a plane on this case<br>here but they could be drones or<br>whatever and you can build three 3D<br>models of the surface here and so we're<br>able to capture that and look at the<br>solar potential for different suburbs<br>throughout throughout Oakland here so<br>this is Mount Eden here um versus pukao<br>here um and you can see the red here<br>illustrating that pukao houses have got<br>a greater potential for solar than the<br>um houses in the Mount Eden area so<br>that's a work that um we initiated um at<br>the beginning of last year and it's<br>still ongoing here and so it raises the<br>question of investment in solar here<br>currently solar um potential is<br>increased from about 5 megaw to uh 35<br>megaw in 2016 so we're going to see an<br>increase in this here the levelized cost<br>so this is the cost of actually<br>recovering your investment uh and<br>obviously maintenance cost and so over<br>the life of a um of of the system here<br>it's about 38 38 30 cents per kilowatt<br>hour which is slightly over um the price<br>that you pay for um electricity next<br>steps here we're working with Mighty<br>River Power to develop an apt um to<br>enable consumers or households to look<br>at um based upon the images that we can<br>produce and the potential that we can um<br>illustrate here whether or not it's<br>worth their while investing uh in solar<br>um and um that's um and and also one<br>other future challenge here is that the<br>invent of of solar is going to create<br>really um big challenges for um the<br>local Distributors such as as vecta<br>because when people are feeding<br>electricity into the grid they're<br>actually using their resource and so<br>there's issues around Market design yeah<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
