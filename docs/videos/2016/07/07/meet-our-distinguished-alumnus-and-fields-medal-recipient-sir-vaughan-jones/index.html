Sir Vaughan Jones received the Fields Medal for his work on Von Neumann algebras which led to fundamental discoveries in knot theory. What does it take to make a significant contribution to a principal discipline that has been a part of the human search for understanding for more than two thousand years. Find out how this kiwi kid became a world leading mathematician in this conversation between Sir Vaughan Jones and Dr Tanya Evans.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>let's talk um again back to your time at<br>the University of Oakland when you were<br>an undergraduate majoring in physics and<br>Mathematics double major um can you<br>describe those years how you remember<br>them as as your development I wasn't U<br>the model student shall we say I did<br>have I did have at least one year there<br>were sort of went off the rails but my<br>career was not um didn't get a and<br>everything ultimately that turned out to<br>be one of the most amusing things about<br>my entire career which is that um I was<br>in a in a year cohort of students who<br>were really quite exceptional and uh so<br>my couple of um Nona grades made my<br>record sort of not look all that<br>spectacular compared with some of my<br>fellow students so when it came to<br>scholarship time you know to go on<br>overseas um there was the other guys had<br>taken all of the the things and was<br>essentially nothing left for me so it<br>looked like that my career was over um<br>at the end of my undergraduate studies<br>or at least my masters but fortunately<br>um there was a guy in the department you<br>know Paul Hafner yes and uh he knew<br>about a a Swiss government scholarship<br>to um for students from specifically<br>from New Zealand and another one a for<br>Australia<br>and um I had<br>for a couple of other reasons I was kind<br>of interested in going to Geneva there<br>was a guy there that was doing<br>mathematical foundations of quantum<br>mechanics and I was I'd read his book<br>and I kind of interested in studying<br>with him and Paul told me about the<br>scholarship so I applied for that and<br>they were delighted cuz they never got<br>anyone applying from Sciences before and<br>so I got that and I went to to<br>Switzerland and you know my career sort<br>of blossomed from there I would say it's<br>really incredible isn't it it's just you<br>know who do you talk right CH<br>opportunity I can't say how grateful I<br>am to to Paul for for that you know<br>without without his intervention that<br>stage as I said my career might have<br>been over I was also playing rugby<br>reasonably well so while you're uni yeah<br>oh right okay um but it's still true<br>that when I went to Geneva from Oakland<br>uh I was began in the physics department<br>during my PhD so it's always been very<br>close in between the two physics and<br>math um the actual path<br>well I was good at it and and I enjoyed<br>it and eventually people started to pay<br>me to do it so that's sort of how it<br>happened and of course that led to you<br>um being um awarded a very prestigious<br>award called a Fields medal and the<br>fields medal is awarded by the<br>international Congress of mathematicians<br>every 4 years and it is um considered by<br>mathematicians as an equivalent of a<br>Nobel Prize for for the<br>Sciences um can you please describe in<br>few sentences your work that um that was<br>so highly recognized there was kind of<br>an unusual sequence of events I was<br>working in a definitely physics related<br>area namely for Norman algebras which is<br>sort of part of the mathematical<br>background for quantum mechanics and<br>Quant field Theory fairly abstract stuff<br>for norom algebra are the supposed to<br>represent the observables of a physical<br>system and that's the mathematical model<br>for it and<br>these forom algebras these algebras<br>observables have a lot of structure in<br>their own right and I was working on<br>that<br>structure and I<br>um I defined this uh So-Cal invariant of<br>a uh of a forom algebra which well<br>actually of a subalgebra you have one of<br>these forom algebra sitting inside a<br>bigger one and I invented this number<br>which describes just how much bigger the<br>big one is than the smaller one it's<br>called the<br>index and um what I observed was that uh<br>this<br>index uh itself is somehow Quant just<br>like if you have uh the hydrogen atom<br>the the um wavelengths of the light Ed<br>from from a hydrogen atom a quanti you<br>don't just get a continuously varying<br>family of wavelengths you get these<br>discrete bursts and turns out that this<br>index was the same instead of getting<br>arbitrary number which is sort of what<br>Forman would have predicted you get<br>these discrete bursts of uh<br>indices because of the proof of this<br>result there was actually a connection<br>um which was totally unexpected with the<br>theory of knots so this is real knots<br>just ordinary knots like the ones you<br>tie in your<br>shoelaces and<br>um it turned out that because of various<br>structure that exists in in in knots<br>when you try to braid your hair or<br>something because I don't have too much<br>left to braid but um if you braid your<br>hair or the braiding that is in in ropes<br>for instance is uh is a structure called<br>the braid group and that particular<br>structure had actually quite<br>coincidentally um been part of my work<br>on forom algebras and from that I<br>managed to discover something new in in<br>not Theory so it was kind of an unusual<br>event where some event in one part of<br>mathematics physics actually has a<br>non-trivial uh impact in a completely<br>different branch of of mathematics and<br>physics and that's the kind of thing<br>that that you know makes waves and<br>people stand up and notice and so and<br>that's sort of how it happened how do<br>you do mathematical research I mean what<br>do you actually do do you sit down you<br>scratch your head do you go through sort<br>of aha moments can you tell us a little<br>bit about well yeah I mean it's a it's a<br>big mixture of of hard work you know you<br>you get you you have something that you<br>think is true and you want to want to<br>prove it figure out whether it is we'll<br>find a counter example and you know and<br>you can get really really stuck I mean<br>I know that in my for instance in this<br>work this index for subfactors work I<br>think I spent at least 80% of my my time<br>in that at least 80% trying to prove<br>something that I thought was true and<br>turned out to be wrong the final the<br>final breakthrough on that was that what<br>you were what I was trying to do was<br>actually completely and utterly wrong<br>the the truth was the opposite of it and<br>that was the hard thing because you're<br>trying to prove something and you try<br>all kinds of methods but you're sort of<br>going in the wrong Direction the actual<br>truth is over here and you only get sort<br>of forced over into that corner<br>after uh after a long time and a lot of<br>hard work and perseverance no doubt yeah<br>and and then there's the the other thing<br>we do have these aha moments I with the<br>not polinomial it was exactly like this<br>I was uh I've been thinking about it for<br>about 3<br>years and<br>um I met up with Joan Burman who was a<br>not Theory braid person in New York and<br>long discuss with her and that was<br>pretty depressing cuz it didn't seem<br>like anything that I had done was<br>actually going to be any use for<br>anything and then but she told me a lot<br>of things and one of those things just<br>kept you know nagging away at my brain<br>and then about a week afterwards I all<br>of a sudden I actually more as woke up<br>in the middle of the night thinking oh<br>my God that's all I have to do I was<br>trying to do something much harder<br>and so I went downstairs did a few<br>calculations<br>and in the middle of the night in the<br>middle of the night yeah and then went<br>back to sleep and of course you have to<br>be aware as I'm sure you are that most<br>of the time when you get a great idea<br>right before you go to sleep you wake up<br>in the morning and it's wrong but this<br>is one the rare occasion it was right<br>yeah well incredible feeling I'm sure<br>yeah it was it was it was a big high<br>yeah<br>m</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
