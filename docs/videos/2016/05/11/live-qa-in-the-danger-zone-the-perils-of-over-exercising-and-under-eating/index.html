However, carrying out an intense exercise regime and not supporting this with a sufficient diet can have serious life-long effects on the body. Society often portrays thin and 'fit' as the ideal body image, particularly among girls and women and increasingly, men too. But skinny doesnâ€™t necessarily mean healthy.<br><br>Our expert panel will untangle some of these common health issues and answer your questions around the psyche and thinking behind the 'fitness addiction' phenomenon.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Koto I'm Alison Robertson and welcome to<br>this University of w live Q&amp;A today<br>we're examining Western society's<br>obsession with weight and performance<br>the damage it may be doing to female<br>athletes in particular but not<br>exclusively and um seeing what might be<br>done to increase our understanding of<br>the links between eating good health and<br>performance on the panel today we have<br>associate professor Holly Thor she's a<br>sociologist co-founder of the online<br>resource fuel Al in New Zealand and late<br>last year she organized an International<br>Symposium that looked at this whole<br>female athlete health issue one of the<br>speakers at that Symposium was former<br>Olympian Sonia wadell who's also with us<br>today along with biological scientist Dr<br>pel alevsky a pharmacologist who<br>researches the link between brain<br>activity and food intake Dr Kirsten<br>Petri as a lecturer often working at<br>Grassroots level looking at how body<br>surveillance and measurement is<br>addressed by um teachers and students in<br>schools as little as low down I don't<br>like say that but in primary schools and<br>Dr Jan cook on my right here is a<br>philosophical counselor who works with<br>girls and women of all ages with long<br>and shortterm eating and Associated<br>mental and physical<br>disorders Holly I'd like to start with<br>you if you could just kind of outline<br>what this whole issue is between<br>exercise and diet sure so it was in 1992<br>that the American College of sports<br>medicine termed uh or coined the term<br>the female athlete Triad so that was<br>recognizing that there were specific<br>issues for female athletes who were<br>training hard um but maybe they they had<br>these three um characteristics so one of<br>those was um uh disorder eating<br>practices<br>um the other is Amara or chronic loss of<br>menstration and the other is um bone<br>health and osteoporosis risks uh so this<br>was studied a lot across a whole range<br>of sports and among lots of different<br>groups of female athletes and they<br>showed that it was actually quite<br>prevalent across across female athletes<br>and then in 2015 there was an uh ioc<br>International Olympic Committee um<br>expert group that sort of uh challenged<br>this idea of the female athlete trade<br>and they're using the word or the term<br>uh relative energy deficiency and Sport<br>because they're recognizing that it's<br>not just three factors it's not just<br>affecting women it's affecting men as<br>well um that it's not just bone health<br>reproductive Health sort of eating<br>practices it also has risks for your<br>your heart for example there's lots of<br>lots of um factors that are contributing<br>to it and there's also been a huge<br>amount of research over the last five 10<br>years um that's shown this is not just<br>affecting female athletes anymore it's<br>also affecting everyday exercising women<br>because they're training um quite<br>seriously many of them are restricting<br>their their diets or following sort of<br>Clean Eating practices and so what we're<br>seeing is some of the same things that<br>we're seeing with female athletes we're<br>seeing among among everyday exercising<br>women so Sonia can you relate to that as<br>an athlete you did you have any of those<br>symptoms and were you aware of you know<br>the issues around what you were doing<br>when you were training yes the the<br>benefit of hindsight is wonderful I wish<br>i' wish I'd been able to to listen to<br>some of this research and and and talk<br>to Holly during during my time in sport<br>um it's a very very real issue and um<br>yes I can take many of the boxers as an<br>athlete um I think one of the one of the<br>really um probably how this is all<br>started for for athletes and for um the<br>general population who who are in this<br>situation is that um you you forget<br>about your health and you're a lot more<br>focused on performance outcomes faster<br>higher stronger exactly exactly and uh<br>and most of the personalities I suppose<br>um and Jane may be able to talk about<br>this a little bit further that those<br>personalities can be very strong um and<br>and they can take your body to uh to<br>extremes and and sometimes uh very<br>irrationally uh so I certainly was in a<br>situation where<br>um I didn't monitor the the input uh<br>versus output um I I lost a lot of<br>weight I was suffering consequences from<br>that um but in a in a very irrational<br>kind of way uh I was also winning in my<br>own mind and I was quite happy quite<br>happy with that um we uh many athletes<br>are led to believe that low body weight<br>equals high performance so again you<br>start to get into a situation where if<br>your body weight naturally decreases<br>then you're doing a good job you're<br>doing a good job and um you know it<br>becomes a very very very tricky downward<br>spiral and the high performance sport<br>culture is so unique isn't it it's<br>almost a normalization of some of these<br>these ideas um and quite a short-term<br>focus on rather than thinking about your<br>long-term Health your bones what's the<br>health of them in 20 years time often<br>it's this competition or this tournament<br>um so that the unique High Point<br>sporting culture as um there's lots of<br>lots of things going on there that make<br>it very difficult for female athletes<br>and their coaches and their parents to<br>understand what's going on here and then<br>address them yeah absolutely that drive<br>is so strong that it can take over<br>rational thinking the the world the<br>world of a of a high performance athlete<br>becomes very very small um and there was<br>actually a um very interesting<br>um questionnaire at the 2000 Sydney<br>Olympics and it said that if you could<br>take a drug at those Olympics that would<br>guarantee you an Olympic gold medal um<br>but you would die in five years time<br>from the side effects would you take it<br>and a staggering percentage said they<br>would 98% something that yeah I think<br>sorry one of the interesting things is<br>the studies coming out of Canada that<br>are saying some of that um desire to<br>please and to perform well so alongside<br>lots of the interventions that are going<br>into schools to support children with<br>their um health and wellbeing so when<br>the teacher or an outside organization<br>comes in and delivers a program about<br>you know eating well and exercising the<br>good kids in the class who want to<br>please the teacher will take that to the<br>extreme because it's a nice way to prove<br>that I am a you know perfect citizen of<br>this classroom and so um as opposed to<br>just the athletes you know at the high<br>performance end<br>with seeing those parents play out in<br>schools and school cultures where<br>interventions um reinforced messages<br>that to be a good child you have to look<br>a particular way you have to monitor and<br>surveil your eating habits how do you<br>count to that well I think some of the<br>broader conversations that teachers have<br>about um and classrooms have and and<br>those spaces about what counil is being<br>valued and what's valued I would like to<br>thank schools had the message that your<br>um health status is not a meure of your<br>success and one is one of the challenges<br>but when we live in a community where<br>skinny equals healthy then that's really<br>hard to you know change and teachers<br>feel a social responsibility to meet<br>with government agendas at the same time<br>so teachers feel morably morally<br>obligated to do a good job themselves so<br>I'm helping I'm helping these children<br>I'm helping you know our society when<br>naturual fact the detrimental effects<br>you know are huge and we might be<br>addressing obesity but long term what<br>are our mental health States got a lot<br>but given that really horrendous so<br>there's that trade-off that sits in the<br>sure J deals with the other end of that<br>the<br>outcomes so um Jane here is a question<br>from Darren he says given the current<br>moral Panic about obesity what role does<br>a fear of fatness play in overex<br>exercising slash underere eating<br>behaviors um good question um it it sort<br>of allows me to uh couch the this entire<br>issue in terms of um particularly with<br>women that I work with and in my own<br>experience um how we come to see our<br>ourselves as women and um the idea of a<br>body shape<br>um becoming a sign in a way a moral sign<br>of of our goodness or our Badness and um<br>particularly for women uh young girls<br>moving into to Womanhood the idea that<br>um um the the real what I would call the<br>real self is in some way deficient some<br>way not good enough or or learns that<br>she must strive to to be good enough to<br>to be loved and and to um attain<br>recognition and so in that situation um<br>we then um recruit I guess um different<br>activities and and our body shape into a<br>pursuit of perfection and uh and and<br>that to me is where the trouble starts<br>that because we have this sense of<br>ourselves as always not quite good<br>enough and we have we're given these<br>ideal of femininity um slimness um you<br>know self-discipline um the the um<br>intelligent um highly achieving um<br>person or or young woman is now the<br>ideal that we all strive for um but what<br>happens when we feel that we're not<br>quite good enough to get there or that<br>when we get there how do we stay there<br>and um of course there are ideals that<br>we're striving after and we can't by the<br>nature we can't we can't meet them so<br>that then sets up a a pattern where um<br>activities exercise um pursuit of<br>Excellence becomes um addictive becomes<br>an obsession in a way that that um<br>consumes us um either because we can't<br>get there or once getting there we feel<br>um<br>a fear of failure what happens if I fail<br>it then becomes an existential issue of<br>um you know what is my sense of self if<br>I fail and and if I lose the identities<br>that I've created and that's where for<br>me it tips over into Eating Disorders<br>that's a really good point and that the<br>all pervasiveness of these messages um<br>particularly for young women but young<br>boys as well about what is healthy what<br>is um sexy what is feminine or masculine<br>and um I think for young people today<br>these these messages are coming from<br>everywhere so it's hard to know where<br>they're coming from but if you think<br>about you know social media is not the<br>the the devil here but plays a big role<br>in terms of even the whole idea of the<br>selfie and how they representing<br>themselves to the world and you know<br>social media is part of their everyday<br>sort of feelings about themselves their<br>connectedness their their bodies how<br>they fit in so I think it's uh these<br>messages about health about achievement<br>about femininity or masculinity are are<br>very hard to push back on because it's<br>hard to know where they're coming from<br>and for for young people it's a<br>difficult difficult situation but those<br>messages I think that they increase also<br>here um they they've been much more<br>prevalent for women obviously for a much<br>longer time but right now the pressure<br>is also increasing when it comes to men<br>uh from just the purely basic research<br>uh science what is important to<br>emphasize is that if we consider it as a<br>stress or some sort of fear response one<br>thing that we do not understand is to<br>what extent these messages that cause a<br>stress will lead to an eating disorder<br>that is actually based on undereating<br>and to what extent they will lead to<br>overeating because it's been shown many<br>many times that uh if you subject people<br>to negative<br>stereotyping uh that actually is<br>conducive to both Bing eing leads to uh<br>an excessive body weight and uh in the<br>minority actually of cases not in the<br>majority of cases in the minority of<br>cases it's going to lead to undereating<br>OV exercising and phenotypes that are<br>anorexic or uh hovering the borderline<br>of uh unhealthy low bmis<br>I think alongside that is that though<br>the culture of surveillance is now so<br>prevalent in society that I'm fascinated<br>by how many people walk around with<br>their Fitbit on you know of all ages and<br>generations you know and now we've got<br>companies you know Ed I have to Reve<br>of Ed just brought out of but for<br>children you know and what does that<br>look like and we have projects going on<br>and Early Childhood centers where we're<br>measuring kids physical activity and<br>accelerometers on babies so at what<br>level do we start the culture of<br>surveillance and monitoring and how will<br>they exacerbate either the overeating or<br>the undereating and then the culture of<br>moralizing and judgment that sits<br>alongside not fitting a social norm and<br>it just it just continues to explode and<br>um regress you know once upon a time<br>we're talking about athletes now we're<br>talking about babies and a pregnant<br>woman who can't eat enough you know<br>because she doesn't want have a fat baby<br>and you know government policy that<br>aligns with those things so just builds<br>constantly that's what Professor Deborah<br>lton calls the Quantified life and we're<br>trying to quantify and calculate<br>everything whether it's from fitbits or<br>our own personal calculations of what's<br>going in and what's going out and I<br>think we've got like you're mentioning<br>the the various extremes but one of some<br>of the research um is showing is<br>actually it's the people who are um in<br>that middle bracket who are struggling<br>with um you know exercising they feel<br>like that's what they're supposed to do<br>to be a good citizen it makes them feel<br>good as well and then they're just<br>carefully sort of calculating their diet<br>or it's not actually one end of the<br>extreme but it's just the Miss sort of<br>calculation there and that could happen<br>for various reasons just by accident<br>that they're not fueling enough to<br>what's going out or it might be some<br>sort of body image issues or dising<br>disordered eating practices but not<br>necessarily those extremes and some of<br>the research is showing that that some<br>of these risks can still affect that<br>metal group and so how do we raise<br>awareness um and again push back on some<br>of those messages but one of the one of<br>the interesting issues is also that<br>despite that pressure and it's been on<br>for quite a long time we don't seem to<br>be moving at least in the Obesity<br>scenario towards a at least positive<br>outcome in terms of average bmis what we<br>are moving towards is just making people<br>feel bad about themselves but the<br>reality of it is because of how we are<br>wired to use the colloquial term uh no<br>matter how badly how bad we feel about<br>ourselves uh we end up eating the amount<br>of food that we have bed to eat so we<br>seek food we seek calories when we start<br>exercising that's why I wouldn't blame<br>you know athletes uh preoccupation with<br>exercise and at the same time giving up<br>on food on on personalities because if<br>you exercise actually you activate the<br>same uh brain areas that you that are<br>normally activated by food and uh after<br>a while it's at least it's hypothesized<br>that um activity of the brain that would<br>normally be induced by food is to some<br>extent hijacked by exercise and you<br>start uh getting pleasure it's<br>especially about reward you start you<br>start getting pleasure from exercise<br>thereby you giving up on food and it's<br>not something that is a conscious<br>decision that is not something that is<br>it's just like an Overeaters and Bing<br>eaters it's not a conscious decision to<br>eat it's actually something that goes<br>against the motivation which is to lose<br>weight and athletes even if you tell<br>them that you have to eat more you will<br>perform better you have certain<br>deficiencies when it comes to the to to<br>nutrients they will still not be able to<br>follow it unless uh they are really<br>doing it with a schedule planner because<br>physiologically they are not able to<br>cope with this sort of challenge well<br>this really shows the complexity of the<br>issue doesn't it from the psychological<br>the biochemical the social messages the<br>educational issues and I think there are<br>unique things going on in the high<br>performance sporting context um that are<br>quite unique but it really shows the<br>complexity doesn't it because if you<br>exercise let's say when I was think<br>about high performance athletes it's<br>been shown I was looking through<br>research uh<br>Publications that uh depending on the<br>intensity of the exercise the more<br>intense the exercise the lower levels of<br>hunger related hormones such as grin uh<br>preceding a meal which means that you're<br>less driven to eat um the compared to a<br>person who is normal body weight and of<br>course in obese individuals actually<br>these levels Sky Ro good before than<br>normal body weight same to even mention<br>the normal I I'm not an expert when it<br>comes to normal body weight I Define in<br>my own case a normal body weight is<br>always below what I am<br>at how do you classify Lisa ask what's<br>classified as OV exercising for the<br>average person it's probably you know<br>one of those unanswer bles as well well<br>I think that's just one part of the of<br>the complexity of this issue because um<br>I mean in New Zealand what's the the<br>extent of this issue among exercising<br>women for example we don't really know<br>um but there was a a master's thesis<br>that was completed last year by a woman<br>at a tarer university um Joan Slater and<br>she found that women who are<br>exercising um over two and a half hours<br>a week not ex you know extreme kind of<br>excis at all but 33% of those women were<br>at risk of what's called low energy<br>avail ability meaning what's coming in<br>to Fu your exercise is not quite<br>covering it so it might have some of<br>those might mean there some of those<br>risk factors of bone health reproductive<br>Health um maybe some sort of eating<br>practices so I can't I don't think we<br>can think about just um over exercising<br>because it's also in relation to<br>relationships with your body and the<br>role of food and um I think it's it<br>comes back to that relationship with the<br>body and whether it's exercise or food<br>um parts of it the relationship with the<br>self as well and how that is is driving<br>you perhaps even to use exercise and<br>food um as a perhaps a kind of numbing<br>mechanism or a way of<br>um suppressing suppressing feelings<br>suppressing the self that we we don't<br>want to see or don't want others to see<br>there's all these uh issues related to a<br>sense of self where where food can um<br>and you know working with my clients it<br>very much um an issue that food and<br>exercise um have a kind of a um an Endor<br>um uh ability to to<br>um suppress unwanted feelings or<br>feelings about the self to um check out<br>from the pressures of every day pursuing<br>the ideal um sense of self or ideal form<br>of self and the interviews I did with<br>with women who had experienced that<br>in response to either their dieting or<br>exercise or a combination the theme of<br>control came up quite significantly it's<br>a way to regain control of their lives<br>through their eating and their exercise<br>and that was um some of them gained a<br>lot of pleasure from disciplining<br>themselves in that way and and actually<br>my my research has looked at okay when<br>they want to create change where did<br>they go as it doctors or social media or<br>psychologists and then the difficulties<br>of creating change because some of it's<br>so deeply embedded in routine and it's<br>hard to change yeah I think Houston<br>brought up a very good point before too<br>about um the messaging that we are<br>inadvertently giving to young children<br>and and their desire to please um and<br>you know you we admire certain things in<br>our society we had we admire healthy fit<br>lean active children and and we give<br>them that message that you're a good<br>child because you're you're eating well<br>or you you know look at you you're<br>lovely and skinny and and as that child<br>go grows and develops<br>they it's probably a very subconscious<br>thing they've they have an association<br>now they've attached values to certain<br>messages and uh and for for girls<br>especially going through puberty when<br>they'll naturally lay down body weight<br>there body fat there their bodies will<br>change um it's very very very difficult<br>for them not to feel like a failure<br>because their their body is changing in<br>a way that is deemed as as a failure<br>from all the messages that they've been<br>hearing and and so you know for for high<br>performance athletes<br>um I I guess the the the or the danger<br>of being able to to fall into some of<br>the traps that we fall into is that um<br>the positive me messages that you're<br>getting uh are reinforced by what you're<br>doing so you're you're getting skinnier<br>and skinnier but that's also great for<br>your sport So you you're praised for<br>doing it um and we<br>see see ATO um has done a lot of work<br>with children's and New Zealand<br>children's understandings of health and<br>the research we did uh locally where we<br>saw Primary School AED children from 5y<br>olds through who you know defining what<br>is healthy what is unhealthy you know<br>it's the stick figure vers the um you<br>know balloon balloon it's the how how<br>what sort of things might you do to heal<br>be healthy well you got to run youve got<br>to drink plenty of water so even what<br>they consider counting as exercise like<br>walking with my family doesn't count as<br>exercise playing on the trampoline<br>doesn't necessarily count as exercise<br>because it's not formalized and<br>structured so we get them into a culture<br>of particular forms of exercise<br>particular forms of understanding being<br>healthy and you know one of our favorite<br>comments is the K goes what if you F<br>you'll never get married you know<br>Notions from young children but you know<br>you're going if saying that there and<br>now we're saying it D back into early<br>child settings more and more that it's<br>just going to it's going to extend so<br>you know we have people with um issues<br>around eating both both extremes and all<br>of us you know I don't think I know one<br>person who doesn't grapple with the<br>complexities of their own body so know<br>you asked earlier what might we do and<br>I'm going well actually if we supported<br>young people to develop healthy strong<br>self-esteem where they felt valued for a<br>whole range of reasons then we might be<br>able to Grapple with a range of those<br>things differently but you know every<br>one of us every person I know was like<br>oh what have I got on my lunch and do I<br>want to show that to someone so how do<br>we deal with that you know if we were<br>able to teach young children that that<br>healthy was was loving themselves and<br>and and who they are inside I think we'd<br>have a a much better starting point well<br>right now what we have even is a problem<br>of defining what healthy food is<br>because it's not just go to a grocery<br>store and virtually every other product<br>is advertising it's miraculous input you<br>know into one's body weight uh we go<br>through fat diet very quickly these days<br>it's actually very difficult these days<br>to even identify what the most popular<br>diet is I mean when I was thinking about<br>it before uh today uh I was trying to<br>think what people follow these days in<br>terms of their favorite diet I was going<br>to say you know someone here has said<br>you know what are the benefits of an<br>what what are the your recommendations<br>for protein intake you know you know<br>you've got those recommendations have<br>not changed for years that's the most<br>amazing things if you just eat a<br>balanced diet whatever has been known<br>for decades right now you will be<br>healthy uh one of the problems that we<br>have I think in the current Society is<br>that we for example tend to vilify<br>nutrients these days I always say that<br>sugar is the new fat um all a sudden we<br>want to introduce tax on sugar uh sugar<br>is the villain uh and if you I since I<br>I've<br>been around for quite a few years I<br>remember still how everything was fat<br>free and it was supposed to cure all the<br>problems uh related to obesity or<br>malnutrition that that stems from<br>improper eating U so it's not clearly<br>about nutrients it's not about<br>particular nutrient we might as well tax<br>Pizza uh because making eating pizza is<br>not healthy either uh but Mental Health<br>on a given day and I think that's part<br>of the ne we've only talked about<br>physical health and as James alluded to<br>where does the social wellbeing the<br>sense of um the mental emotional and the<br>spiritual and if we take a mar or an<br>indigenous perspective of well-being or<br>much more holistic one then we need to<br>account for that and if someone's<br>needing a glass of wine like we might at<br>the end of the day is that unhealthy and<br>you know how does that fit into the into<br>the equat but we don't think about that<br>we often talk about physical health as<br>the defining factor of health and every<br>week we basically are bombarded with<br>messages chocolate will make<br>you happy will make you unhappy very<br>often same foods are because you know<br>how we report data but the same foods<br>are labeled as something that is good<br>and a few weeks later they are labeled<br>as something that was bad for you so you<br>have these messages about about health<br>and what is healthy but at the same time<br>we have these messages about what is<br>beauty yeah and these are culturally<br>specific of course but uh I keep coming<br>back to the role of social media in this<br>because there's all these different<br>messages and forms of knowledge that<br>that young people today are having to<br>negotiate and they're not they're not<br>dupes to that and some of them are quite<br>critical and conscious but you know<br>there are some really alarming kind of<br>messages like the um the A4 movement and<br>in China which was basically you hold up<br>an A4 piece of paper and the aamos your<br>waste to fit behind that and this is<br>supposedly motivating young women to be<br>able to be this have a waste of this um<br>of this size but what was interesting in<br>social media space is there was a huge<br>push back to that as well where women<br>were standing there and taking their<br>selfie with them with their degree in<br>front of them or with a father of four<br>daughters with four pieces of paper<br>saying pushing back on this this idea so<br>you've got these messages of Health<br>you've got these messages of beauty and<br>femininity and and young people today<br>are having to stand at the intersection<br>of this and negotiate it and education's<br>a part of helping to I think the<br>interesting thing there is you say that<br>is social media is huge but then we have<br>these authority figures in our lives<br>that also reinforce particular ways of<br>behavior so I can go to school in that<br>my teacher will make comments like well<br>we can't have cake even though it's your<br>birthday because it's unhealthy you<br>can't have this and your lunch box you<br>can't do this we have interventions<br>going into schools and then you go to<br>your GP and the GP goes look you need to<br>lose some weight well how why how do you<br>define that is it based purely on my cig<br>silhouette not my cigarette sorry my<br>Silhouette um you know how do you decide<br>on that because we also equate Health as<br>skinny but we also have the health at<br>any size movement and actually if I'm<br>bigger and active am I healthier than<br>someone who's you know in terms of<br>physical weth you know smaller and<br>inactive and how does all that stuff<br>play out so sorry so many different<br>factors and it's so bamboozling and but<br>for me the in my work and and in this<br>discussion what you said Kirsten is<br>about the child and that we develop that<br>self-esteem or that sense of self I<br>think they already have it in the child<br>they they're born with it they know what<br>they need and they know what um<br>satisfies them um it's it's when they<br>lose that sense of their own wholeness<br>and and their their self- knowledge um<br>and that knowing of what is healthy for<br>them what their body needs May what my<br>body needs is different or you know<br>whatever so it's when we cause them to<br>start to doubt that and lose that sense<br>of self and that confidence but then we<br>look at experts we look everywhere else<br>but in here and the answers are in here<br>if we can only rebuild and and you know<br>find that that um that inner voice and<br>that inner wisdom um then we know we<br>know how to be healthy in ourselves yeah<br>there seems to be so many different feds<br>of diets like there's five two now that<br>kind St yourself a couple of days um<br>Sita says well fasting only eating fruit<br>once a day for a whole day every week<br>once a week is that considered under<br>eating and I would think so well right<br>now I I would say this in the current<br>uh good environment it is very difficult<br>to uh see in our society real<br>undereating in terms of calorie under<br>consumption of calories unless you talk<br>about people who are truly anorexic who<br>are in the the<br>unhealthy Zone uh skipping a meal or two<br>meals to eat only only fruit it's<br>unlikely to create a<br>an adverse Health effect as long as a<br>person follows a healthy diet balance<br>diet the rest of the week<br>so but the re there's a lot of research<br>that's showing if we are just focusing<br>on diet that's one part of it we're<br>looking at exercise as well there's a<br>new sort of phenomenon that is is<br>growing um when it's not necessarily not<br>eating but it's the low energy<br>availability meaning you're not getting<br>enough you might just be disordered<br>eating practices or might be quite<br>subtle to not cover what's going out so<br>if you're bumping up your exercise and<br>you're you know reducing your food<br>intake that's when you can get an<br>imbalance that can have these types of<br>effects that female athlets have been<br>experiencing whether it's long-term bone<br>health reproductive issues um<br>cardiovascular health and and it's that<br>sort of middle group that is this sort<br>of Silent phenomenon because it is<br>having health effects and also it<br>depends on the purpose because let's say<br>if person if a person decides okay why I<br>for example would like to I have high BM<br>uh levels I would like to lose weight my<br>GP has suggested that I would like to<br>try it and the easiest way for me would<br>be to for example dedicate one day to<br>eating mainly a food diet there's a<br>completely different story behind this<br>then a person who is an OV exerciser who<br>exercises let's say every day two 3<br>hours a<br>day if you're feeling it appropriately<br>it's okay because there are high<br>performance athletes out there there are<br>people who love exercising and they<br>train here as long as they're fueling it<br>appropriately but as soon as you get<br>some sort of it's all about<br>balance it's oh no no I was just going<br>to talk about the the the question<br>around over exercising and it's probably<br>exactly as Holly says that um I mean<br>when I was rowing we trained I trained<br>uh 16 17 times a week you know seven<br>seven about seven hours a day and is<br>that overe exercising well for for much<br>of that time no it wasn't because that<br>was what I required to produce<br>performance um and as long as I was<br>fueling that exercise as long as I<br>wasn't suffering adverse health effects<br>I wasn't um a minic I wasn't um<br>suffering bone health issues as as my<br>mental health was was good around was<br>someone monitoring that for you or is it<br>up to you to monitor it um I guess there<br>was there was some monitoring around it<br>there probably wasn't a lot of<br>understanding around it um when when I<br>was competing um but I I suppose my my<br>my point is that overe exercising is not<br>is not quantifiable as such under is not<br>quantifiable and as you say it's it's Ur<br>antic and and you know very critically<br>low body weights it's it's everything<br>else that goes around it it's it's the<br>mental health it's the physical the bone<br>the things we can measure that's when I<br>can actually if I can add it to this I<br>think that there is also one additional<br>uh feature that is critical in defining<br>over exercising which is the previous<br>Baseline um they released last week a<br>small study uh in which they followed<br>Biggest Loser<br>participants uh and uh I think they<br>followed winners or those who were at<br>the very top uh and what they found was<br>that these people and they more or less<br>followed your what you're describing as<br>your exercise regimen except for uh<br>their Baseline before they entered the<br>program was completely different they<br>were not uh gradually uh uh introduced<br>into the program but instead it was this<br>shock therapy uh it was very effective<br>because they lost collectively hundreds<br>of pounds however now I think six years<br>after because they followed them for<br>several years I believe 13 out of<br>14 uh regained uh their way and the one<br>who didn't uh had gone through the<br>gastric bypass surgery uh and they are<br>all saying that for them what they've<br>noticed was that once they stop they<br>tried to continue with those exercise<br>routines many of them would and it was<br>very beneficial for them because it<br>taught them how to exercise uh they all<br>said that it was impossible to follow<br>the exercise regime that they were uh in<br>a way forced to do when they were part<br>of the program uh they checked actually<br>their metabolic rates and that was the<br>most interesting thing because their<br>metab basic the basic metabolic rates<br>are right now a couple of hundred<br>calories kilo calories a day lower than<br>what they should be for individuals<br>their body weight so because of this Pro<br>relatively prolonged because it's a few<br>months exercise program that they were<br>not used to they were ship into very<br>rapidly they all of a sudden experience<br>physiological changes that would<br>counteract this extreme exercise and for<br>them immediately OV exercising probably<br>would be defined as that what for you<br>was exercising yeah and it could be some<br>of the reason why there is such a<br>problem with the the middle band of the<br>population because they um pets look<br>look at what Elite athletes are doing or<br>they or they follow those kind of<br>training regimes and and pets perceived<br>eating regimes um but without the<br>background knowledge to it and and and<br>for two weeks<br>for two weeks which actually I mean we<br>don't know truly what the data would be<br>for individuals who do these shorter<br>term exercises in terms of their<br>metabolic rat and I know I keep to<br>children and young people but I think of<br>the children I coach and young people I<br>work with who are in school sports teams<br>and rep sports teams and may train<br>multiple times and and that might work<br>in terms of them being Elite performers<br>at 12 or 16 whatever we Define as aite<br>at that age but it's like what are those<br>patterns like and then they come to<br>University and suddenly life is<br>different and Mom and Dad AR counting<br>them and moering you know doing<br>everything for them and monitoring them<br>so that understanding of yourself and<br>that life change and where you're at and<br>what will constitute exercise and that<br>time and frame you know changes but<br>often we've got caught into a thing of<br>I'm now under exercising or whatever but<br>how do you fit it in and all those sort<br>of things so understanding of self and<br>understanding the needs of your body at<br>different times and where it's at and<br>being able to make sense and read your<br>own body as a useful strategy that we<br>can help young people grapple with and<br>be<br>accepting and part of our female athlete<br>Health Symposium and the second day was<br>more focused on community and making<br>this information more accessible and<br>there we had coaches and PE teachers and<br>parents coming along to that because<br>they play an important role particularly<br>with younger athletes in terms of okay<br>they are identifying or they're<br>concerned about one of their athlet<br>or their students or their children who<br>doesn't seem to be eating quite enough<br>or something's going on there what do<br>you do them and how do you have those<br>conversations in really sensitive ways<br>and how do you then um help seek out the<br>the help that's that's going to really<br>help them get back into a more healthy<br>relationship with their body and<br>exercise and<br>uh there can be a a wild goose chase uh<br>trying to find good information out<br>there and a lot of the people that wom<br>that I've spoken with went to the GP who<br>sent them to here who sent them to here<br>sent to here and thousands dollars later<br>they're still not finding the help they<br>need and um that's what we Tred to do<br>with the female the fuel our website is<br>there's a professional support network<br>on there with with health professionals<br>who are um explicitly working in this<br>area so hopefully um women or people who<br>are going through these issues can<br>firstly get some information for<br>themselves figure out what's working for<br>them what's going on for them perhaps<br>and then seek out professional advice um<br>because there's so much information out<br>there and so many bad diets and so much<br>false<br>information that that can really help<br>fuel some some pretty negative<br>relationships with one's body and sens<br>of self and wellbeing and and belonging<br>in our society so just um we are sort of<br>moving quite quickly through the 45<br>minutes um we've got some questions here<br>um I'm not sure um we will be able to<br>answer them but we'll give them a go<br>interested to hear your thoughts on the<br>use of fats as fuel as opposed to<br>carbohydrates for females looking to Fat<br>Loss or for fat loss do women metabolize<br>fats better than carbohydrates for fuel<br>than men do I don't know if the goal is<br>fat loss is there an ideal type of<br>exercise to team up with<br>this well in terms<br>of I I think that the main message to uh<br>people when it comes to body weight and<br>BMI and is that the common denominator<br>is a calorie it doesn't matter what<br>source of the calorie is so if it is<br>carbohydrate it's fat I mean I'm not<br>talking about the balanced diet in this<br>case because a balanced diet is a must<br>but if you're just looking from the<br>point of view of a of weight loss the<br>calor is a calorie modifying your diet<br>will probably benefit you plusus 10% but<br>not more in terms of what you of course<br>if you think about the calories in<br>broccoli versus calories in uh per gram<br>of french fries there's a gigantic<br>difference in how full you feel but it's<br>about stomach distension it's how much<br>your stomach is stretched and it's also<br>about whether you feel full after eating<br>a given food or not so it's more about<br>choosing the food that makes you feel<br>full and satisfied and that there is a<br>huge individual difference in that uh<br>Pro preferably choosing food that is<br>calorie dilute because so has a low<br>number of calories per gram but in terms<br>of and eating a balanced diet but<br>everything else is going to have a<br>minuscule body weight just wondering in<br>terms of eating prior to exercise events<br>son you might know about this how many<br>hours before an event should athletes<br>look to eat a full or substantial meal<br>for example a marathon runner or someone<br>doing an Iron Man event and what should<br>the athlete do if the event is to start<br>early in the morning like 8:00 or<br>before I don't know if I am the right<br>person to answer it or not but I can<br>certainly um speak from experience<br>um a lot of it has to do with<br>physiologically how uh quickly you able<br>to digest foods so some foods are take a<br>lot longer to digest which means that<br>you're concentrating blood um to that to<br>that area of your body for for longer um<br>other Foods get into your bloodstream<br>almost immediately and and take very<br>little of digestion so um and it maybe<br>maybe outdated um but um when we were<br>competing we kind of had a I guess a bit<br>a bit of a guideline of um you you would<br>have your reasonably main meal uh no<br>closer than three hours before your your<br>race um and I've you know I've had races<br>at 7 o'clock in the morning so that<br>makes for a very early get up um time to<br>make sure that you're fueled fueled for<br>that event um<br>obviously it will also depend on the<br>duration of your event so um if you're<br>rowing race that takes seven minutes<br>long um it it probably doesn't it's not<br>quite so doesn't matter so much if<br>you're in a marathon uh that's taking or<br>an Iron Man even more so that's taking<br>most of the day um it's it's an ongoing<br>fueling that you're you're going to be<br>needing to look at so what you're<br>fueling your body with through that<br>event that you're able to digest and and<br>take up without<br>um obviously making yourself feel very<br>very sick and what about dietary<br>supplements how do they kind of fit into<br>the equation uh my take on dietary<br>supplements was is that uh if they were<br>truly uh efficient and effective in<br>doing something they would have already<br>been patented and sold as medicines by<br>pharmaceutical<br>companies um<br>this is a this this is a very um clear<br>definition of a of a substance that<br>works versus a substance that does not<br>work if it was truly effective it would<br>be a medication it would be either<br>available through prescription or over<br>the counter but it would be classified<br>as a medication everything else is it<br>it's just either a way of for people to<br>feel better urban legend uh or just a<br>waste people Mak a lot of money yeah<br>people make a lot of<br>money over this and the we cannot I mean<br>the laws are constructed the way they<br>are constructed so this is a legal uh<br>anecdotal interesting well it's been an<br>interesting 45 minute discussion we<br>thank you for your questions the people<br>that sent questions in and um we'd also<br>welcome any feedback online if you have<br>to give it and any other questions you<br>have we can pass on to the panel<br>contributors today so Kirsten pavell<br>Holly Sonia and Jane thank you very much<br>for joining us<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
