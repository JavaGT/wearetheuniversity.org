font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I did expect the amount of like patient<br>contact that would have I knew that that<br>was um always integrated into our study<br>but I didn't realize just how valuable<br>it would be and how lucky we are to be<br>able to do that straight away it's a<br>very practical based profession and it<br>entirely relies on students or<br>physiotherapists being able to relate to<br>their patients being able to communicate<br>really well with them 6 weeks into our<br>course in second year and we're out<br>there which is daunting but amazing this<br>stuff's all good in theory but how does<br>it apply to like a clinical setting and<br>that's that's really driven in right<br>from the get-go lectures at 8:00 a.m.<br>which for the most part we make with a<br>coffee in hand and then so for every<br>lecture that you kind have so you've got<br>an hour you go away to a 2hour lab to<br>get to apply those skills you you kind<br>of work through whatever was said in the<br>lecture so it might be a certain<br>technique or it might be much more of a<br>like a teaching lab with a bunch of<br>activities it it varies quite a bit but<br>generally it'll be things actually like<br>Hands-On working on things you have to<br>be comfortable with people and so that<br>touching and practicing you kind of<br>develop quite a close Bond doing that<br>because you're really putting your body<br>into their hands as such and vice versa<br>I'm a Hands-On learner so writing out<br>notes and Lear it that way doesn't<br>really do it for me but if you put me in<br>a clinical setting with a patient I'll<br>be a little bit rugged to start with but<br>by the end of it I'm usually quite good<br>at doing what I'm doing one of the<br>things that is unique about the a go<br>model is that the school continues to<br>provide support for clinical education<br>all the way through their final year of<br>study I love the patient interaction and<br>talking to people and really getting to<br>know what they're like because<br>everyone's so different it gives you<br>just a chance to actually<br>treat patients and have a go and they<br>they're all really willing to um give<br>you advice on what's working for them<br>and what's not working for them we have<br>such a different approach to other um<br>medical disciplines um in terms of we've<br>got quite a broad understanding of what<br>is important to a patient to the vast<br>majority of them go into a clinical<br>career working with patients um doing<br>physiotherapy practice and we're very<br>much geared up for that in addition to<br>getting their University of itaro degree<br>we also have to make sure they reach<br>competencies for the New Zealand<br>physiotherapy board you already had an<br>advantage coming to coming down to denen<br>as far as life experience goes that is<br>what really sets Den apart from other<br>universities in in New Zealand is a much<br>more student oriented experience it's<br>crazy fun we go on camps we have<br>multiple different events throughout the<br>year we've got Miss physio coming up<br>this next week we have our bull um it's<br>like one big close-nit<br>family because of um the immersion year<br>they have in fourth year and and the<br>exposure all the way through the program<br>definitely that's the advantage that<br>ataro has they they they've got a very<br>good reputation for being absolutely<br>ready to go on qualification and there's<br>masses of opportunities for them there's<br>lots of jobs out there last year for<br>example at graduation I was talking to<br>the students there and most of them had<br>two or three job offers so it's a good<br>job market for students<br>presently</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
