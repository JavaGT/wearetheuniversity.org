Recorded 12 April 2016.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>podcast good evening uh my name is<br>harleen Hayne and I have the great<br>privilege of being the vice Chancellor<br>here at the University of atago and it<br>brings me great pleasure to welcome you<br>to this inaugural professorial lecture<br>as always it's fantastic to look around<br>the room and see academic and<br>professional staff from throughout the<br>university as well as students and it's<br>always particularly pleasing to see<br>members of the general public who come<br>along and join in in these inaugural<br>professorial lectures I'd also like to<br>extend a special welcome um to Paul's<br>family who is here to support him this<br>evening his mom and Brunton and his<br>sister Caroline who traveled here from<br>the UK to be with Paul on this<br>particularly auspicious occasion and I<br>understand that neither of them have<br>ever heard him speak in public so this<br>will be a fantastic opportunity for them<br>to hear him at his very best and I would<br>also like to warmly welcome Paul's<br>partner um Ian Crabtree who was also<br>here this evening making this a truly<br>Family<br>Affair now sometimes at these ipls we<br>come together to welcome um someone from<br>outside our um atago Family into the<br>family at the University of atago so on<br>the one hand we're here to celebrate um<br>promotions for people from within but<br>from time to time we are also here to<br>welcome someone who who is joining our<br>fold and this is certainly the case this<br>evening where um we are welcoming<br>Professor Paul Brunton who was a<br>professor long before he came to the<br>University of atago but late in 2014 he<br>joined the University of atago as the<br>dean of the dental school um following<br>the retirement of Professor Greg<br>Seymour now I knew at the time that we<br>hired Paul that he was going to be great<br>for this particular job um he was chosen<br>because he had an International research<br>reputation because he is an outstanding<br>clinician and teacher and because he is<br>a strong and gifted leader but to be<br>honest I didn't really realize how<br>fantastic Paul was going to be until he<br>actually arrived here on campus and once<br>I had the opportunity to spend more time<br>with him and to work with him directly I<br>soon came to realize how truly fortunate<br>we are here at the University of atago<br>to have attracted Paul into this<br>particular role<br>now as many of you in this audience are<br>very well aware the university has<br>recently initiated the most ambitious<br>building program in this University's<br>147 year history and among our current<br>projects is the single most expensive<br>and most complicated project we have<br>ever embarked on and that is our new<br>dental school which includes a fully<br>functioning Dental<br>hospital now Paul's vision and<br>Leadership has been invaluable in this<br>project and his calm considerate and<br>well-informed approach to All Things<br>regarding the dental school gives me<br>great confidence that we are all making<br>the right decisions so Paul on behalf of<br>the University of atago I would like to<br>officially welcome you almost two years<br>down the track um to your position of<br>Dean I have already enjoyed working with<br>you and I certainly know that everyone<br>in this audience will continue to cheer<br>for you and for your staff as you<br>continue to build on the reputation for<br>excellence that is already so well<br>deserved by the dental school um not<br>only for its research but also for its<br>teaching and for its outstanding patient<br>care we are also delighted that you have<br>decided to come and join our University<br>of itago family and we are pleased that<br>both you and Ian um are here with us<br>this evening and on behalf of the um<br>university Ian I just want to let you<br>know um that at the University of itago<br>we believe that two dogs are always<br>better than one<br>we understand that the Paul and Ian<br>family are contemplating adding a pet to<br>their family and there's some debate<br>about how many pets there should be so<br>when in doubt I always shoot for the<br>higher<br>number I will now call on the PVC of<br>Health Sciences um Professor Peter<br>krampton to tell us just a little bit<br>more about Paul's Journey to the<br>uh thank you very much Vice Chancellor<br>taroto car to our colleagues friends and<br>visitors it's my very great pleasure to<br>introduce forly uh Professor Paul<br>Brunton and I would like to add my words<br>of Welcome to Paul's mother and to his<br>sister who' traveled from England to be<br>with us this evening and to visit New<br>Zealand so welcome to New Zealand<br>welcome to denen Welcome to the<br>university and welcome to Paul's<br>inaugural Prof aoral<br>lecture and also I'd like to extend my<br>very warm greetings as well to uh to Ian<br>Crabtree Paul's<br>partner so Paul's professional history<br>dates back to December 1984 which by the<br>way makes him an exact contemporary of<br>mine I think uh when he was awarded his<br>Dental degree from the University of<br>Leeds his professional career started<br>properly when he was a house officer in<br>restorative Dentistry at leed's Dental<br>Hospital in<br>1985 and later on he had appeared as a<br>general Dental practitioner which has<br>been the grounding for many if not Mo<br>most of us in the professional World in<br>Manchester during<br>1987 followed by regist<br>positions between 1993 and 1994 he was a<br>senior Dental officer in advanced cons<br>con conservation and Prosthetics at the<br>North St sture health<br>authority and between 94 and 96 Paul was<br>The Clinical Director of dental services<br>at the combined Healthcare NHS Trust<br>stok on Trent and<br>Staffordshire between 1996 and 1997 he<br>was a senior registar and dental Public<br>Health at Birmingham Health Authority<br>and it was during this time that Paul<br>gained his PhD from the University of<br>Manchester in 1996 and the title of his<br>PhD was variations in preparations for<br>indirect tooth colored resin bonded<br>Restorations from 1997 to 2001 he was a<br>clinical lecturer in restorative<br>Dentistry that's when his academic<br>career got going properly at the<br>University of Manchester and an honorary<br>senior registar in restorative Dentistry<br>at the central Manchester Healthcare<br>trust and after a passage of time and<br>this is what harleen referred to in<br>December 2004 Paul was appointed as a<br>professor of restorative Dentistry at<br>the University of leads and as an<br>honorary consultant in restorative<br>hospitals Paul's research expertise is<br>in clinical research uh particularly<br>designing conducting clinical research<br>trials and also in practice-based<br>research within the general dental<br>practice setting<br>he has published over 100 books book<br>chapters referee Journal articles review<br>papers and so on and his publication<br>list does include work related to<br>teaching and curriculum<br>development uh Paul's held many<br>prestigious and important positions<br>including for example and this is by no<br>means exhaustive if it were to be<br>exhausted would be here all night but he<br>was the clinical lead for the E project<br>which uh is a national project in the UK<br>with a budget over of over a million<br>pounds um Eden is an e-learning resource<br>for all members of the dental team and I<br>believe it has over 13,000<br>users uh Paul termed uh served a term as<br>president of the British Society for<br>restorative dentistry and also a term as<br>president of the section of odontology<br>of the Royal Society of medicine and as<br>I say the list could go on and on he has<br>had many important an<br>appointments in addition he's received<br>many distinctions and fellowships which<br>similarly are too numerous to list<br>here importantly from our perspective<br>Paul was the academic lead for the<br>Recently completed uh 9.5 million pound<br>uh leads dental school refurbishment<br>project and of course we valued that<br>experience and background<br>so about a year ago just over a year ago<br>in January<br>2015 Paul arrived at the University of<br>Vago to take up the role of Dean of the<br>dental school and I'd have to say that<br>since then he's been swept up in a<br>Maelstrom of incredible<br>activity and the projects are numerous<br>but they include I'll mention two<br>particular ones which are very big and<br>very challenging uh the new dental<br>school building project with which the<br>vice Chancellor referred to this is very<br>very complex um very uh uh detailed in<br>its planning and execution and I'm<br>amazed every time I see Paul on the<br>street or in my office or in his office<br>looking calm and<br>relaxed uh the other major project which<br>I will mention is called digital dental<br>and this uh is another very large and<br>complex project uh the objective of<br>which is to bring chair side radiography<br>and also chair side patient records uh<br>for every teaching chair in the dental<br>school and there are other projects too<br>which Paul's um also leading in the<br>dental school my final comment is a<br>personal one so from a personal point of<br>view Paul is an excellent member of the<br>division of Health Sciences senior<br>leadership team and it's a pleasure to<br>have him as a colleague so on that note<br>I would now like to invite Paul to<br>deliver his inaugural Professor lecture<br>which is titled it's all about the<br>patience Kora uh tenac Coto Kor welcome<br>everybody uh it's very nice to see you<br>all and particularly thank you to the<br>vice Chancellor Deputy Vice chancellors<br>and the pro Vice Chancellor for the<br>welcome that I've received and can I<br>just make a general comment before I<br>start my the welcome that we've received<br>in New Zealand has been amazing and<br>thank you for<br>that what I thought I'd talk about<br>tonight is a little bit about me and the<br>type of research that I do and then I<br>thought I'd talk a little bit about some<br>of the research projects that we've been<br>involved in over the last few years and<br>and and these are just examples of the<br>things that we've been doing which I<br>hope are of of interest uh to colleagues<br>and people who are here tonight so I<br>want to talk very briefly about<br>translational and practice-based<br>research because that's my interest<br>that's what gets me out of in the<br>morning uh and then talk about<br>treatments for sensitive teeth how you<br>whiten your teeth what you do with teeth<br>that are decayed what you do when know<br>some patients have no teeth and how we<br>handle that and then talk a little bit<br>about uh where that's taken us in<br>translational research looking at uh how<br>we manage the warn dentition so just a<br>little bit of a dip into all those<br>particular areas uh over the next 40<br>minutes or<br>so so for those of you who are not<br>colleagues of mine because they all know<br>the answer to this because I talk about<br>it frequent ly but for those of you who<br>are not colleagues of mine don't work in<br>the dental faculty just have a thought<br>about why academic dentists clinicians<br>good teachers get out of bed in the<br>morning and we'll come back to that<br>question at the very end and I'll try<br>and answer it for you so for those of<br>you who don't know the answer think<br>about that so my theme is clinical<br>benefit because I strongly believe I'm a<br>very um clinically focused academic in<br>Dental research and I always think about<br>the benefit of patients and how we<br>translate research that we do in the<br>laboratory uh and in various other<br>departments within the dental school how<br>we translate that into a benefit to<br>patients because if we don't do that<br>then we're missing the point uh would be<br>my contention so translational research<br>for those you not familiar with the term<br>is research that results in products and<br>services that benefit either or both<br>patients and society and that's very<br>much the research space in which I aim<br>to work<br>I have experience of practice-based<br>research networks and very interested in<br>practice-based research and the reason<br>I'm interested in that is that most<br>Dentistry is provided by General Dental<br>practitioners 90% of it arguably uh and<br>therefore that's where I think research<br>should be and I think practitioners<br>should be talking to us about the<br>challenges that come from clinical<br>practice to give us the research<br>questions that we should try and answer<br>as academics so a practice-based<br>research network is is a framework that<br>enables us to work with practitioners<br>who we can train to do real world<br>research research done by practitioners<br>on patients we can generalize the<br>results and the findings and we can then<br>translate that into benefits for<br>patients<br>worldwide it's also a flexible route to<br>get practitioners engaged in research<br>and engaged with the dental faculty and<br>we then can reach out to the dental<br>profession and Community within New<br>Zealand and that's helpful in terms of<br>what we can acheve aieve together as a<br>community we have uh the arch initiative<br>within within the faculty and I'll<br>mention that just very very briefly so<br>we have a practice-based research<br>Network in the dental faculty currently<br>that's called achieving research through<br>the hands of clinicians and I'm very<br>pleased to be able to be a part of that<br>now and to add my interest and a little<br>bit of expertise to my colleagues who<br>are running that and just very very<br>briefly that's all about working with<br>practitioners doing research that's<br>relevant to New Zealand and I've leared<br>very quickly that I have a lot of<br>experience in the UK you move to a new<br>country and you have to change your<br>thinking because things are not the same<br>and findings that will inform Health<br>policy and result in a benefit uh to new<br>zealanders and and internationally as<br>well which has to be our focus and the<br>one thing we have to work on is reducing<br>the lag between research evidence coming<br>to the four and changes in clinical<br>practice and I'll come back to that a<br>little bit later as a theme<br>so if I may now talk to you a little bit<br>about the research projects that we've<br>been doing over the years um again<br>they're all challenge LED so these are<br>research projects that have come from<br>practitioners and patients asking us for<br>evidence-based solutions that they can<br>Implement in their daily practice so all<br>of you will be familiar with sensitive<br>teeth so you bite into an ice cream you<br>get a sharp pain have a cold beer<br>whatever you get a sharp pain and the<br>treatment for that has always been<br>certainly in the was the use of Fluoride<br>Varnish and we all really knew that it<br>kind of worked for about two weeks and<br>then the pain would reappear and people<br>are nodding and they're agreeing with me<br>so they they know the problem so what we<br>wanted to do was investigate whether was<br>there was a more evidence-based<br>treatment that produced a much more<br>long-lasting benefit to patients and so<br>we conducted a clinical trial and I've<br>spent most of my academic life uh doing<br>clinical trials looking at new<br>treatments and interventions that might<br>benefit patients so for those of you who<br>don't have any Dental knowledge why did<br>teeth hurt as we get a little bit older<br>in life we get some recession the roots<br>of the teeth become exposed to the mouth<br>and the oral environment and those<br>little holes you can see here are<br>dentinal tubules that open up and as<br>fluid or anything cold moves across<br>those tubules the osmotic effect of that<br>change in temperature causes the tubules<br>the fluid in the tubules to move a<br>little bit and that just jerks the<br>nerves connected to the Adon blastic<br>cells here and we translate that into<br>ouch and we think<br>painful so the challenge was how to<br>effectively treat uh sensitive teeth or<br>Dentin hypers sensitive as we might call<br>it and so we do a randomized control<br>trial which is a very rigorous um<br>structure for a clinical trial that<br>eliminates as much bias and allows us to<br>really focus on the research question so<br>we get the answer to the question that<br>we're trying to to answer so um we did a<br>randomized control trial we randomly<br>allocated three treatments to a group of<br>patients so a third of them get no<br>treatment which is always a bit<br>challenging because if you're in the no<br>treatment group you still got the<br>sensitivity and you're not getting any<br>help um a third of them got a<br>desensitizing toothpaste and I'll show<br>you um what that toothpaste was in a<br>minute and a third of them got a very<br>fancy adesive that has an antimicrobial<br>in it that you could paint over those<br>dentinal tubules and seal them up so as<br>the ice cream and the cold beer or the<br>cold drink went past the Dentin or<br>tubules you didn't get the sensitivity<br>and we wanted to see if the treatments<br>would last for six months uh because the<br>current treatment Fluoride Varnish would<br>only last for two weeks which wasn't<br>very helpful so there's the fancy ADF<br>there produced by one of the dental<br>supply companies h no surprise we're<br>using a Colgate toothpaste and of course<br>the poor devils in this third arm of the<br>study got no treatment and had to wait<br>on the result<br>so interesting results and I don't know<br>how clear that is but yeah that's okay<br>so the the the special ADF we were using<br>uh resulted in relief of symptoms in the<br>vast majority of patients for periods of<br>up to 6 months so at six months there<br>was huge reduction in sensitivity and<br>the desensitizing toothpaste resulted in<br>some reduction in sensitivity but it<br>wasn't long lasting and the reduction<br>sensitivity wasn't as great and of<br>course the the subjects on the control<br>here uh no change in sensitivity during<br>the period of the trial so there's an<br>evidence-based treatment there's some<br>evidence there to support that treatment<br>based on a randomized control trial and<br>I would argue that dentists should be<br>using that more and more in practice as<br>a treatment for that uh presenting<br>condition and what I always try and do<br>is we write the scientific paper up<br>because that's really important for PBF<br>and and that's one of the metrics that<br>we have in the University by which our<br>research performance is measured but<br>what we also write is a an article that<br>in a magazine that dentists will read to<br>try and get them to think about changing<br>their clinical practice because that is<br>a<br>challenge now if we look at this<br>individual here who you might recognize<br>um a long time ago he obviously had a<br>lot of um problems with his teeth shall<br>we say and I want to talk a little bit<br>now about whitening and some of the<br>research we've done around tooth<br>whitening and I'll explain in a minute<br>why I believe that tooth whitening is of<br>interest to us um obviously that<br>individual who for those who don't know<br>that's Tom Cruz went on to have a lot of<br>dental treatment to Rectify that as you<br>can see H and then went on to the middle<br>years we all have a middle-aged crisis<br>men included and he reached the point<br>where more Orthodontics and tooth<br>whitening was carried out to so the end<br>result was very very nice and if you<br>look here you know there are you see<br>this throughout life white teeth are<br>associated with being more employable<br>being more attractive being more<br>confident and people have orthodontic<br>treatment they have tooth whitening to<br>achieve these results uh now why am I<br>interested in tooth whitening because<br>that's the alternative or it was until<br>relatively recently so we've got sound<br>teeth here this patient has no fillings<br>in their mouth whatsoever but they're<br>worried about their Dental appearance<br>It's upsetting them it's embarrassing<br>them it's socially handicapping them<br>which is important and so they go after<br>the dentist who picks up a drill or<br>turbine as we would say puts a diamond<br>bur in that turbine and reduces those<br>teeth and then sticks some porcelain<br>facings on the front of them to achieve<br>that result there<br>now I I'm I wouldn't be happy with that<br>result and I would argue there's an<br>evidence-based treatment that you can<br>use I tooth whitening uh to improve the<br>appearance of those teeth without having<br>to damage them and that's the trick you<br>can improve the appearance of teeth now<br>without having to damage them<br>whatsoever so we need an evidence based<br>to that because it's a bit of a Dark Art<br>so we started to look and and<br>practitioners were coming to us with<br>questions about what's the most<br>effective way of whitening teeth uh and<br>what's the evidence base behind it and<br>there was no real evidence base<br>whatsoever so if you look at this<br>picture here you've got an individual in<br>a dental surgery this is a very<br>high-intensity light there's some high<br>concentration bleach on those anterior<br>teeth the front teeth and they sit for<br>about half an hour the teeth get very<br>very hot but they become very very white<br>process I decided um well in talking to<br>practitioners that I wasn't convinced<br>the light was doing thing so we wanted<br>to design a trial that would allow us to<br>tease out whether actually having the<br>light there made any difference and this<br>was a start of a personal journey and<br>we'll come on to the second leg of it in<br>a minute so again recruiting patients<br>for Whitening trials very very easy uh<br>everybody wants white teeth and of<br>course the the treatment effect is so<br>great the numbers you need in those<br>trials is actually quite small and<br>they're still the power of those trials<br>is still very very high so we got 22<br>individuals and randomly ated them into<br>two groups and they all got the same<br>treatment the light was positioned there<br>the bleach was put on the teeth but for<br>half them we didn't turn the light on so<br>they'd lie there with bleach on the<br>teeth but the light wouldn't be on and<br>we noticed and our results at the end<br>show that there was actually no<br>significant difference between the<br>whitening effect we achieved with and<br>without the light and because of the<br>heat that's generated by these lights we<br>worry about<br>sensitivity and so we measured that as<br>well so if you look here there's<br>actually no difference in the whitening<br>effect we we achieved with and without<br>the light and the sensitivity levels<br>were slightly different but the<br>difference wasn't significant so that<br>then answered in our minds the question<br>about the light that we were testing and<br>I think you can translate that to other<br>lights that are used in a similar way um<br>so then I asked the question we then<br>asked the question well if people have<br>bleaching in the surgery with a dentist<br>it's very expensive the dentist has to<br>do the treatment they have to line in<br>the chair for about 9 20 minutes um if<br>we do bleaching at home is that as<br>effective as having it done by a dentist<br>so the next question that we wanted to<br>answer was if we do home bleaching or<br>home whitening uh can the result be as<br>good as the dentist putting High<br>concentration whitening products on your<br>teeth uh with or without the light as it<br>were so another trial um here we've got<br>36 subjects because we've got two<br>concentrations of bleach and we've got a<br>group that are going to have the light<br>activated bleach in as well so all of<br>them have home bleaching which is if I<br>just go back is a tray that you place at<br>night usually at night you put it a<br>bleaching gel in the tray you wear it at<br>night and you repeat that process for<br>about two weeks and the effect on<br>whitening is quite profound so done at<br>home by the<br>patient here we've got a trial where<br>we're looking at doing that at home on<br>your own just doing that uh doing it<br>with um ins surgery whitening with the<br>light and different concentrations as it<br>were and the net result to cut to the<br>chase there's actually no difference so<br>the whitening effect that we achieved<br>significantly was no different in all<br>those three groups so in my mind we've<br>answered the questions about do we need<br>to use ins surgery whitening does the<br>dentists need the fancy light the answer<br>to that is clearly no can patients<br>achieve the same result at home under<br>supervision and the answer to that is<br>yes and here's one of our subjects here<br>with tetracyclin staining mercifully<br>rare these days recycling is a drug<br>that's given for certain treatments and<br>if it's given when the teeth are<br>developing they develop stain and<br>discoloration so here we've waien the<br>teeth of the the upper teeth of this<br>individual but we haven't treated the<br>lower teeth so if you ever go to<br>Manchester in the UK I come from south<br>of that City in Cheshire but if you ever<br>go to Manchester and you see people with<br>white upper teeth and dark lower teeth<br>they will be subjects who've been on our<br>clinical trials over many many years<br>because we never used to do the lower<br>teeth it's a bit sad really and we've<br>published obviously the the results of<br>these trials over the<br>years so now um moving into a different<br>space another area of interest for me is<br>tooth decay and this is very significant<br>tooth decay and these are anterior teeth<br>um permanent teeth adult teeth uh with<br>significant levels of Decay and uh for<br>those of you who don't know Decay goes<br>through many many stages before it gets<br>as as significant as that and we wanted<br>to ask answer a question as to whether<br>we could do anything at an early stage<br>to reverse the<br>process so I think of this as<br>translational research and I put these<br>pictures in just to uh talk a little bit<br>about how research gets from the<br>laboratory to the patient uh and people<br>often think of it as a pipeline so<br>somebody has a bright idea in the<br>laboratory comes up with a new treatment<br>for this it moves through a c a process<br>of development and then a treatment is<br>actually uh comes out of the other end<br>that's of benefit to patients and that's<br>how we get new drugs etc for the<br>treatment of heart disease whatever I I<br>think this is more of a circular<br>Pipeline and certainly what what happens<br>is the process is as I've described but<br>once that Drug's been treated on<br>patients it then goes back to the<br>laboratory to see if further<br>improvements can be made so it's a<br>constant cycle of improvement to improve<br>the efficacy of the treatments that<br>we're trying to<br>develop so the question we were trying<br>to answer here was can you cure decay<br>tooth decay uh Dental carries as we<br>would say at the Whit spot Legion and<br>I'll show you Whit spot Legion in a<br>minute so you'll know exactly what I<br>mean and many of you will probably have<br>seen Whit spot lesions on your own teeth<br>and this came from work that was being<br>done in bone defects where we use it<br>self using a self assembling peptide<br>I'll explain what that is in a minute um<br>to to heal bone defects and we wondered<br>if we could use it and translate that<br>science to dental decay so here we've<br>got a wh spot lesion that's dental decay<br>so the very bad front teeth that you saw<br>um started off with a white Legion such<br>as<br>this at that stage the mineral loss<br>because that's what tooth decay starts<br>as its reduction of mineral and removal<br>a mineral from the tooth it's reversible<br>so you can reverse the process at this<br>stage so we decided we'd run a clinical<br>trial to see whether the the treatment<br>that we developed in the laboratory<br>might have some benefit in this regard<br>so that's the structure of teeth and<br>it's a bit fancy so don't worry too much<br>about that but it's calcium and<br>phosphate make up the vast majority of<br>the mineralized component of teeth so<br>it's a reduction in calcium and<br>phosphate and loss of calcium and<br>phosphate from the surface that causes<br>uh Dental carries starts the process<br>off so using self- assembling peptides<br>peptides are just proteins uh but if<br>they can assemble together and form a<br>structure that can attract calcium<br>phosphate to it and you can get to<br>assemble in the defect in the tooth then<br>you can pull the calcium and phosphate<br>in and in in theory heal the lesion and<br>that's well that's our starting premise<br>so if you look at this diagram here<br>you've got a white spot lesion here on<br>on a tooth there if you look at that<br>under the microscope you'd see these<br>little losses of mineral the pores<br>opening up on the surface of the tooth<br>if we could get our self assembling<br>peptide applied to that could we get it<br>to run into those pores on the surface<br>of the tooth form a<br>scaffold attract calcium and phosphate<br>to it form hydroxyapetite and then seal<br>up the<br>tooth um healing that<br>lesion so we took our initial trial uh<br>15 healthy adults uh with wh spot<br>lesions this was just to try the science<br>out because we were just pushing the<br>boundaries a little bit after 30 days<br>there was a significant decrease in the<br>size of the lesions and a shift from<br>ression to remineralizing and I'll show<br>you some examples of some of the lesions<br>that were treated in the study this one<br>here reduced in size at the top the one<br>at the bottom you can see on Baseline<br>and further on the legion has<br>disappeared so these are sort of<br>standardized photographs we have to take<br>to demonstrate that and that then<br>translated into commercial products that<br>are available today so um there's a<br>treatment there for curon repair um<br>that's marketed by the company that uh B<br>the licenses from the University of<br>Leeds to translate this technology uh<br>and they've now produced kuron proect<br>and they're using the same self<br>ascending peptides to fill up those<br>dentinal holes I showed you in the<br>people with sensitive teeth that then<br>remineralizes and seals those up and<br>then the sensitivity reduces the thing<br>that fascinated me was that when the<br>lesions healed they healed the same<br>color as the original tooth so it was<br>almost undetectable which is<br>amazing so again just another taste of<br>some of the things we've done uh for<br>patients who have no teeth uh life can<br>be very very difficult and the<br>production of Dentures for them can be<br>slightly<br>problematic and one of the questions<br>that we were interested in was to make a<br>denture you need to take an impression<br>so you fill the tray with some<br>impression material for those who've had<br>Dental Impressions you know what it's<br>like it's not very pleasant can be<br>unpleasant shouldn't be but it can be uh<br>you have to take a mo an impression and<br>make a mold to then make the Dentures on<br>and there was a question in our minds<br>about what was the best material to make<br>that impression from and more<br>importantly did it affect the outcome IE<br>the dentures that were provided for the<br>patient because dentists make choices<br>they choose an impression material it's<br>based on personal preference it's based<br>on cost but actually was there a<br>difference that we could tease out that<br>actually affected the treatment outcome<br>for the patients because if you're<br>wearing dentes functional Comfort is<br>everything so you've got to be able to<br>function but it's got to be very<br>comfortable so that's an impression of<br>the type that would be taken and that's<br>using silicone which is a a rubber type<br>material that we use to take on<br>Impressions and in the UK at the time<br>alginate which is another impression<br>material that uh is used widely in densy<br>was the material that might be used for<br>that<br>process so this was a big trial that we<br>did we had 85 edentulus patients that we<br>identified in the UK and we made all of<br>them two sets of Dentures they didn't<br>know which denture they were receiving<br>first so they didn't know it was made<br>with the algate impression or the<br>silicone impression and our outcomes<br>were what was the comfort for the<br>patient could the patient pick up a<br>difference that was relevant and<br>measurable and did the Dentures produce<br>with one material or the other material<br>need more adjustments to make them<br>comfortable uh and what was the quality<br>of life of those patients who got the<br>Dentures with one material or the other<br>so that's the structure of the trial and<br>I don't expect you to read that but<br>that's the length we go to move bias<br>focused down on the question of interest<br>and so patients would have dentures in<br>different orders so that they didn't<br>know uh which was coming first which was<br>coming second in fact they didn't know<br>until the end of the trial and then they<br>chose which was the most comfortable<br>pair to keep and take<br>away there was no doubt about it<br>significant evidence that silicone<br>Impressions make a difference and uh<br>that's the goal standard in terms of<br>Impressions uh for dentures I think the<br>today uh the patients found the Dentures<br>more comfortable they required fewer<br>adjustments and their quality of life<br>was much better uh and this was all<br>measurable and significantly different<br>than if it had Impressions taken with<br>the the normal uh cheaper alternative<br>material that would be<br>available lastly we'll talk a little bit<br>about warn<br>teeth and then I'll conclude a little<br>bit and uh but here we've got a patient<br>who is um in their early 30s so<br>significant two wear and there's a<br>reason for that um that's a combination<br>of reflux that's stomach acid coming up<br>into the mouth uh diet and uh and<br>various other things but this patient<br>came to us with significant concerns<br>about their appearance so worn teeth are<br>a significant problem going forward<br>we're all living longer which is<br>fantastic the quality of those added<br>years are getting better when I trained<br>as a dental student and qualified in<br>1984 the anticipation was that most<br>people would survive their dentition and<br>that Dentures would become the norm now<br>in the UK that's completely gone now so<br>we're reaching this the point where<br>teeth are wearing out which 30 years ago<br>was never a consideration but toothwear<br>now is a real consideration and there's<br>a real treatment need and to<br>rehabilitate that patient to give them<br>back a functioning dentition took many<br>many hours to achieve that so the<br>treatment costs to provide that<br>treatment are<br>significant and you can see the outcome<br>there in terms of what we've achieved<br>there I started to have an interest in<br>Facial Pain and um myalgia as we would<br>deter uh term it these days and that's<br>pain in the sort of temporalis muscle<br>here and the M muscle here which are the<br>muscles that open and close the jaw<br>primarily and they're big meaty muscles<br>you can feel your M muscle here and the<br>temporus muscle<br>here and I'll explain why this is<br>related to um toothwear in a minute<br>myalgia is quite common so when we have<br>exams on campus students will develop<br>symptoms and get a little bit stressed<br>and uh it's temporary and it disappears<br>uh shortly after their examinations are<br>passed and they relax and uh those<br>symptoms disappear but the prevalence of<br>this is quite High nearly half the<br>population the other thing about living<br>longer and um retaining teeth for longer<br>is the effects of tooth where as I say<br>start to build up but if you're stressed<br>grind your teeth and you all of us will<br>I'm sure relate to this and children<br>actually grind their teeth significantly<br>but my practice has always been in<br>adults but um broism as we would call it<br>sleep broism or awake broism people can<br>grind the teeth during the day and be<br>completely unaware of it but most people<br>would do it at night and their partner<br>would be very aware of it and they would<br>not be as aware of it but the effects of<br>that are quite<br>significant and the fact going back to<br>our 30-year-old with a very warn teeth<br>we use things called stabilization<br>splints these are splints plastic bite<br>guards if you like that we place on<br>people's teeth that allow us to<br>effectively position the jaw and allow<br>us to provide uh the the rehabilitation<br>the treatment that we need to but also<br>they're there to protect the teeth from<br>further damage so if you grind your<br>teeth at night what we might do<br>sometimes is give you an appliance to<br>wear at night that makes sure you can't<br>do any further damage to the teeth which<br>seems very sensible because many<br>patients when you talk to them say as<br>long as it doesn't get any worse I'm<br>happy so we would call on a splint like<br>this and then we were starting to get<br>concerned because providing splints for<br>the treatment of brois and grinding<br>teeth might affect um obstructive sleep<br>apnea in the sense that if a patient's<br>got that or they're prone to that<br>inadvertently we could be making it<br>worse by providing a treatment for just<br>their teeth and that's when we tend to<br>think of the teeth and forget the<br>patient and this is about thinking about<br>the patient and the consequences of the<br>treatment that we might provide so we<br>designed a trial to try and tease out if<br>patients were diagnosed with sleep<br>broism were they at more risk of<br>obstructive sleep apnea because a<br>dentist could walk into that provide a<br>treatment that actually could make the<br>obstructive sleep apnea much worse and<br>that's significant people fall asleep<br>driving cars because of obstructive<br>sleep apne so the effects are<br>significant so we got a sequence of<br>patients coming through the Le Dental<br>Institute and the Dental Hospital in<br>Manchester and we met measured the risk<br>of obstructive sleep apnea in patients<br>with myalgia patients with sleep brism<br>and also controls people who didn't have<br>either of those conditions and the<br>results were interesting so there's a<br>validated questionnaire that allows you<br>to assess the risk of obstructive sleep<br>atmia called the stop bang questionnaire<br>very simply filled out by patients in<br>the waiting room before they come in uh<br>to see us on the clinic so that was our<br>tool for uh obstructive sleep apnea an<br>excessive daytime sleepiness is assessed<br>using this questionnaire which again has<br>been validated so we applied these<br>questionnaires to three groups of<br>patients to see what the results might<br>be and we were surprised because the<br>Sleep brism patients had a significant<br>risk of obstructive sleep apnea so if we<br>were providing a treatment for that we<br>could in effect make that worse and that<br>just needs teasing out a little bit more<br>and patients with<br>myalgia discomfort in the muscles uh<br>didn't sleep as well as they might do in<br>had excessive daytime sleepiness which<br>was again significantly different than<br>the uh the control groups so that's an<br>area that I'm continue to explore with<br>my co-workers because it's a fascinating<br>area uh that we want to probe into a<br>little bit<br>more so what does the future hold for me<br>uh as I say we're delighted to be here<br>uh but I still want to do and be<br>actively involved in research because<br>that's why I joined academic dentistry<br>in the first place and it's important to<br>me and and two of the things that we're<br>focusing on at the moment uh we're<br>looking at an antimicrobial filling<br>material for the treatment of root<br>carries in the elderly because that's<br>you live longer you retain your teeth<br>longer you get longer in the tooth all<br>those things are true you're more prone<br>to root car as an old age and to find a<br>simple treatment for that that could be<br>effective is<br>useful and we're also working on a<br>dental solution that can help with the<br>management of obesity which is very much<br>out of Dentistry but exciting and one of<br>the things I like about working here is<br>the opportunity to collaborate and<br>network outside the dental faculty with<br>colleagues in other areas of the<br>university is<br>fascinating so why do dentists academic<br>dentists clinicians and teachers get out<br>in the morning get out of bed in the<br>morning it's a question I used to ask um<br>prospective Dental students at the<br>University of leads many many years ago<br>and I used to get the answers make loads<br>of money drive a flash car um because I<br>have to uh but actually the reason we<br>get out of bed in the morning to work<br>tirelessly in the service of our<br>patients and that's really important<br>it's very important to me so thanks are<br>due to many many people who I can't name<br>because I just don't have time to do<br>that this is just a spectrum of the<br>people I've worked with over the years<br>some of who I continue to work with um<br>they've been an amazing support to me<br>and I learn more from them on a daily<br>basis than they learn from me these days<br>and I think that's a good thing my<br>years sorry without which I would be<br>nothing and the many research subjects<br>who've worked with us over the years in<br>the clinical trials uh I reckon we've<br>had I was trying to work it out last<br>night over a thousand maybe 1500<br>patients on all these trials over the<br>years it's important they help them<br>contribute because after all them said<br>and done it is all about the patience so<br>thank you very much indeed for your<br>much that was fantastic thank you my<br>name is Helen Nicholson I'm one of the<br>Deputy Vice chancellors at the<br>University and it's my great pleasure to<br>thank Paul for his fascinating talk I<br>think we've whisked through a lot of<br>Dentistry that those of us who aren't<br>dentists are very glad that we know<br>about now so thank you um and and in<br>listening to your um lecture it's it is<br>all about the people isn't it it's all<br>about the patients and I I think one of<br>the roles of Health researchers is to<br>focus on Research that will have<br>clinical benefits to individual patients<br>and The Wider Community as a whole and<br>Paul's lecture has highlighted to us how<br>he's been able to do this in a variety<br>of ways how he's listened to the<br>patients and also to the general Dental<br>practitioners and being able to walk<br>work with them and the importance of<br>structures such as Arch to facilitate<br>that he's also Illustrated how<br>researchers should work with patients<br>understanding what's important to them<br>why they why you need to um qualif uh<br>train qualified practitioners and bring<br>the Gen General Practitioners into the<br>academic setting and work with them um<br>and how<br>it's really important that the research<br>that we do is able to be translated to<br>the chair side I should say not the beds<br>side so he's really also shown us the<br>importance of Teamwork because as you<br>watched looked at his slide it was<br>around groups of people working together<br>um and facilitating this Improvement to<br>dental<br>care and he's also talked about how we<br>need to think about what's happening in<br>other fields of research that may not<br>necessarily be direct ly in the area<br>that we work in but in in Allied fields<br>and thinking about how some of the that<br>research can be brought into our own<br>field of<br>research and I guess um the take-home<br>message really is that I've learned that<br>having a really good smile is important<br>for<br>life so Paul we'd like to give you a<br>small token to to remind you of this<br>special day okay thank you thanks I've<br>got okay thank you very much thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
