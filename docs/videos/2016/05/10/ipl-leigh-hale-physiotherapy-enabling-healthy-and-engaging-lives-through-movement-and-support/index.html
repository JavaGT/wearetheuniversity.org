Vago<br>podcast good evening my name is harleen<br>Hayne and I have the great privilege of<br>being the vice Chancellor here at the<br>University of itago and it is my<br>pleasure to welcome so many people from<br>the University and from The Wider denan<br>Community to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture um it is always fantastic um<br>when I come to these lectures and see<br>representation of both staff and<br>students from around the wider<br>University<br>but I think it's also equally fulfilling<br>for me to see that so many members from<br>The Wider denan Community come along to<br>join In This Very Special<br>celebration I also have a couple of<br>other special welcomes to give this<br>evening um in addition to members of the<br>community and members of the University<br>I would also like to warmly welcome<br>Lee's husband Allan who is here as well<br>as her two daughters and their Partners<br>uh Jennifer and Nick and Michelle and HH<br>who have traveled um here this evening<br>from Wellington and Auckland<br>respectively and I think it's probably<br>quite clear that when family members<br>make the journey um it is yet another<br>signal about how important um tonight's<br>event is but in addition to the support<br>of her colleagues and her family um Lee<br>is also supported this evening by<br>members of her profession um and I think<br>that that is equally important to<br>highlight so on behalf of the University<br>I would like to welcome Janice Mueller<br>who's the chairperson of the<br>Physiotherapy board um Janette wman<br>black who's the CEO of the phys<br>physiotherapy Board of New Zealand and<br>Joe ashar who is the CEO of<br>physiotherapy New<br>Zealand now we are here tonight to<br>celebrate the promotion of uh lee Hail<br>to the position of Professor and as many<br>of you have heard me say multiple times<br>it is not an easy feat to achieve the<br>level of Professor here at the<br>University of itago it requires that you<br>are a gifted researcher an outstanding<br>teacher and that you are also actively<br>involved in service and certainly Lee<br>has met all of those criteria um she is<br>an internationally recognized researcher<br>in the area um particularly of<br>disability um she is an award-winning<br>teacher and I think the other thing I<br>would like to point out is that she is<br>also an outstanding<br>clinician but in addition to all of this<br>um Lee is also um a very gifted leader<br>and time and time again uh since she has<br>been here at the University of itago she<br>has demonstrated her ability to build<br>and develop relationships between<br>members of the university community<br>across a number of different disciplines<br>and I'm extremely pleased that Professor<br>hail has now accepted the challenge of<br>becoming the next dean of the school of<br>physiotherapy um and uh we very much<br>look forward to her taking over that<br>position as Professor Baxter steps down<br>so Lee on behalf of the University of<br>atago I would like to congratulate you<br>on your well-deserved promotion to<br>professor and I would also like to wish<br>you the very best of luck in your new<br>role as Dean I will now hand over the<br>microphone to Professor Baxter who will<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>Professor hail's uh journey to<br>professorship<br>uh tenot colleagues and uh let me add my<br>welcome to you all this evening as dean<br>of the school of Physiotherapy and it's<br>my pleasure to introduce Professor<br>Hill's<br>lecture an inaugural professorial<br>lecture is a prestigious and significant<br>event it is a significant milestone for<br>any academic and of course for Professor<br>hail this evening and of course for her<br>family and friends who are here to<br>support<br>her you might not recognize this but<br>it's also a significant milestone for<br>the school for the University and for<br>the profession of Physiotherapy in New<br>Zealand Professor Hill is the first<br>physiotherapist to have achieved<br>promotion to professor atoto and the<br>vice chancellor has already pointed out<br>how difficult it is to attain this chair<br>in uh at the<br>University this says much about the<br>rapid development of the profession in<br>the academy in New Zealand as an example<br>the first physiotherapist to achieve a<br>PhD in the school was in 1998 less than<br>20 years ago it also says much about the<br>professor who is presenting this<br>evening Lee an Hill was born and grew up<br>in rudia modern day Zimbabwe but moved<br>to South Africa to go to attend<br>University she completed her initial<br>Balor training as a physiotherapist at<br>the University of Cape Town in<br>1982 and subsequently her Masters in<br>Physiotherapy and PhD which were both in<br>the area of Neurology at the University<br>of the witz waterand in 1993 and 2002<br>respectively prior to entering the<br>academy Professor Hill gained a range of<br>clinical experiences a physiotherapist<br>firstly in the United Kingdom and then<br>in South Africa and both in the hospital<br>and Private Practice settings it was at<br>this stage she developed her interest in<br>neuro Rehabilitation which has informed<br>her clinical her academic and research<br>practice throughout her subsequent<br>career starting initially as a part-time<br>lecture in 1990 Professor Hill worked at<br>the University of witw and until 2000 by<br>which time she had achieved promotion to<br>senior lecture and was ready for fresh<br>challenges here in New Zealand at here<br>at the University of atago<br>Professor heill joined the staff of the<br>school of physiotherapy as a lecture 15<br>years ago on the 1st of May<br>2000 over the intervening years she has<br>contributed to and led the neurological<br>physiotherapy teaching within the school<br>at undergraduate and postgraduate level<br>during this period She has instigated a<br>variety of curriculum developments and<br>enhancements most notably and recently<br>the Innovative youve Clinic which brings<br>people with disabilities from the<br>community<br>into the school to be assessed and<br>treated by our students as part of their<br>skills<br>Labs Professor Hill was promoted to<br>senior lecture in 2005 and associate<br>professor in 2010 the sort of 5year<br>cycle to things I'm wondering what's<br>going to happen in the next 5 years she<br>was also held various leadership roles<br>at the school over this period including<br>previously associate Dean for research<br>and most recently as Deputy dean of<br>school as you might expect Professor<br>Hill has an impressive research profile<br>which is a credit to her hard work and<br>her dedication to her chosen profession<br>and field Lee has authored a co-authored<br>four chapters book chapters almost 100<br>full publication and peer-reviewed<br>journals these make for interesting<br>reading and some for fascinating reading<br>I note that one paper even manages a<br>homage to the Spice Girls One does<br>wonder who else but Lee would think of<br>incorporating the title of a paper to<br>disability and rehabilit ation one of<br>the most respected in the field tell me<br>what you want what you really really<br>want for information this is a<br>qualitative interview based study so it<br>was quite<br>appropriate Professor Hill has also made<br>significant contributions to research<br>training in her field having supervised<br>to successful completion 12 PhD students<br>and almost 20 Master's dissertation and<br>thesis<br>students she was recognized for the<br>quality of her Supervision in 2007 by<br>nom ation for the Osa outstanding<br>supervisors award this nomination was<br>supported by all H her graduate research<br>students at the time Professor Hill also<br>subsequently received the Osa teaching<br>Excellence award for inclusive teaching<br>in<br>2013 in support of her work Professor<br>Hill has attracted almost $3.5 Million<br>worth of research funding as primary our<br>associate investigator such funding<br>Awards have come from a variety of<br>funding agencies and groups including<br>the prestig health research Council of<br>New Zealand hopefully we will get to<br>hear a little about the research this<br>funding has supported in he in Lee's<br>lecture Professor Hill is a well-known<br>and respected member of the university<br>community a common theme in feedback<br>from Professor Hills colleagues and<br>students is her commitment her<br>dedication and her leadership not only<br>within the school but within the teams<br>on which he works a notable example of<br>such leadership was some years ago when<br>Lee decided that the whole neurot<br>teaching team including all research<br>students who were working in neuro<br>Rehabilitation that they should go to<br>the physia therapy New Zealand Neurology<br>Group Symposium to be held in Nelson in<br>that year unfortunately the available<br>budget from the school was only<br>$1,000 however Le's determination<br>coupled with judicious use of funds to<br>hire a mini buus and a Backpackers in<br>Nelson ensured that five faculty members<br>and five research students all attended<br>this Symposium several also learned how<br>to drive a<br>minibus that became known as the neuro<br>road<br>trip Professor Hill maintains a high<br>level of service to the profession most<br>notably she's been editor of the New<br>Zealand Journal of physiotherapy since<br>2010 and a member of the journal's<br>editorial board since 2006 her various<br>professional achievements were<br>recognized by the New Zealand College of<br>physiotherapy by appointing Leah fellow<br>in 2008<br>outside the profession locally she has<br>served as Secretary and Committee Member<br>of the otago medical school research<br>Society from 2008 to 2013 and continues<br>to be actively involved with her local<br>communities here in denen I can think of<br>no one who better deserves the<br>distinction of being our first internal<br>appointment to professor at atago it is<br>my pleasure to invite Professor Hill to<br>deliver her inaugural professorial<br>lecture physiotherapy enabling healthy<br>support thank you Hollen thank you David<br>the mic's<br>working I'm tenot Couture and um very<br>good evening to you all and thank you<br>for coming especially a a large thank<br>you to our distinguished guests I'm<br>trying to find them from the our<br>physiotherapy Board of New Zealand and<br>our profession physiotherapy New Zealand<br>and thank you to our vice chancellors<br>our Deputy Vice chancellors Peter David<br>and my family for coming here this<br>evening and a very warm welcome to you<br>all I'm very humbled and honored that<br>you've come tonight and I can see so<br>many friends out there um especially on<br>a chil night so thank you for coming to<br>I'm going to have to wear my<br>glasses in the general scope of practice<br>for physiotherapists in aruro New<br>Zealand published by the physiotherapy<br>Board of New Zealand it states and I<br>read physiotherapy identifies and<br>maximizes quality of life and movement<br>potential by using the principles of<br>promotion prevention treatment and<br>intervention habilitation and<br>Rehabilitation and indeed movement for<br>life is our professional body's<br>Mantra and tonight I've extended that or<br>this Mantra this evening to<br>physiotherapy enabling health and<br>engaging lives through movement and<br>support that's all very good but how do<br>we get people to move for life and in<br>this instance I'm talking for Life<br>lifelong how do we get people moving<br>lifelong and how do we prove that that<br>actually does enable um health and<br>engaging<br>lives physiotherapists use movement to<br>assist people in a whole range of<br>conditions and I've been very fortunate<br>in my career as a physiotherapist to<br>work in many of these<br>areas so I started Life as a<br>physiotherapist as as they said I<br>trained at the University of Cape Town<br>in South Africa and I started my life at<br>the criso hospital in Cape Town storm is<br>country for those that don't know<br>these were very exciting times at kuscu<br>hospital Christian Barnard had done it<br>the first heart transplant and crusco<br>was reving in this um International<br>Acclaim and um if you worth your salt as<br>a physiotherapist at ccure you worked in<br>intensive care unit and only the very<br>best worked in cardiac surgery um in<br>with um with Christian Barnard and his<br>colleagues so I was very privileged when<br>I worked at crio hospital because I<br>worked in a lot of areas of<br>physiotherapy albeit I did not work in<br>cardiac<br>ICU wasn't that good and I use movement<br>I use active or active assisted or<br>passive movement to assist people with a<br>whole range of conditions so while I<br>worked at ccure I worked in the<br>orthopedic Wards in those days people<br>were on traction for long periods of<br>time lying in bed so we kept them active<br>with mov<br>and especially um you know the injured<br>Parts um strengthening muscles I I did<br>work in respiratory and Neurosurgical<br>icus getting people mobilized even if<br>they were still on ventilators I spent a<br>long time in the burns unit making sure<br>people didn't um develop contractures<br>and stiffness from the burnt sides and<br>um grafted sides I even did chess<br>physiotherapy where we use movement on<br>the chest to mobilize secretions from<br>the lungs if they've got chest<br>infections I worked in amputation<br>Rehabilitation I even did manipulation<br>and mobilization on spinals in order to<br>treat pain um spinal and neck pain and I<br>even worked in neonatal care where we<br>used very tiny movements on the chest to<br>mobilize secretions and suction very<br>tiny babies that was the scariest part<br>of of my work that I've ever worked in<br>and I worked in postnatal and antinal<br>key so so you can see I've worked<br>everywhere but my passion was a neuro<br>Rehabilitation working with people with<br>stroke multiple sclerosis and<br>Parkinson's<br>disease back in the day we tended to use<br>very passive approaches to physiotherapy<br>we tended to do things to patients and<br>expect them to get better or tell them<br>what to do and expect them to do<br>it we were very much the experts waving<br>that magical wand and people would get<br>better<br>my husband Alan and I then were<br>transferred or Alan was transferred and<br>I followed up to<br>Johannesburg and there I entered the<br>world of Academia at the University of<br>the vatas rant and still with my passion<br>in neuro Rehabilitation but still very<br>much with my passive approaches very<br>firmly<br>embedded one of the clinical teaching<br>hospitals we used in Johannesburg or at<br>vvar<br>was the Chris baguan Hospital in Soo and<br>at the time it had 3,000 beds and a<br>cated for about 3 million people and<br>sometimes there were people above the<br>beds and under the beds if there were<br>too many for the<br>hospital we only had 21 physiotherapists<br>and eight physiotherapy<br>assistants it was here that I became<br>very involved in the sueta stroid group<br>a self-help group for people with stroke<br>and they made me see life<br>differently I I was asked by the leader<br>of the group Mrs Mavis chabalala to<br>provide an exercise class and on the<br>first day I went to the sweater stro a<br>group with all my physiotherapy<br>knowledge and wisdom to give the class<br>but I had to sit and wait while they<br>greeted each other and got warmed up for<br>the session and let me show you how they<br>did<br>this on the day of our<br>meeting uh the stroke a patients are<br>being collected from their various homes<br>there is a bus they have a<br>transport that collects them they start<br>from my place then we go to<br>various<br>homes to go and collect them we start at<br>8 and by uh 10:00 we are at the<br>home it's not always sunny to hanburg it<br>when we get to the home<br>we open our meeting<br>with<br>prayer after that we a call a<br>register and then after that we collect<br>some monies that they should pay for<br>their<br>tea as it is a selfhelp group they have<br>they they they pay for their own<br>tea after that um after collecting some<br>as you can see they did not need me to<br>provide them with an exercise<br>class but rather to use my physiotherapy<br>knowledge to endorse and support what<br>they already doing well and yes at times<br>to give appro as appropriate advice and<br>this led to my PhD um topic<br>how can we as<br>physiotherapists optimize services for<br>and enable people living with stroke and<br>suo and at the time people um were in<br>were admitted into baragan with a stroke<br>and the the length of time was for only<br>two weeks so they had two weeks in which<br>to do Rehabilitation then they were<br>discharged home and that was it so we<br>had two weeks and the Western models of<br>spending an hour with the patient was n<br>good enough to help them but then we<br>wondered well what are their problems<br>how can we really help people with<br>stroke unless we know what their<br>problems were so my PhD used mixed<br>methods to try and find out well what<br>were the main issues and therefore how<br>can we best help them so I asked them<br>and of course the quantitative question<br>years told me a bit but it was really<br>the in-depth qualitative interviews<br>where you talk to people that told me<br>the most and I asked them what life was<br>like for them after stroke and although<br>they were very sad that they had lost<br>the ability to independently do<br>activities of daily living like washing<br>themselves or um going to the toilet um<br>what was most distressing was the loss<br>of usefulness of worth within the family<br>unit so they would say things to me like<br>I said no I'm not here to say please in<br>the night this worries me what she meant<br>was that she had to say please can you<br>get this please can you help me to go to<br>the toilet he's going to have a cup of<br>tea and she worried at night about<br>this I always fight with my family let<br>me do something not just<br>sit now I'm as sad for myself because<br>when I could do things for myself I<br>could work for my children I could make<br>everything for my children but now I<br>can't so my PhD taught me a lot of<br>course but the main message I got<br>surprise surprise was that people need<br>self-esteem to feel wanted and to be<br>empowered and that's what as<br>physiotherapists we needed to focus on<br>in<br>Rehabilitation this message has guided<br>my subsequent research and teaching and<br>still using movement to hopefully enable<br>people now adding another key ingredient<br>and that is support and in my research<br>I've mostly used the sort of all<br>powerful top of the quantitative um uh<br>research design the randomized control<br>trial in a number of studies to try and<br>prove whether things work or not but<br>it's been the backstory the qualitative<br>component of the studies we've done that<br>have been the most<br>informative so one area I've work done a<br>lot of work in with a lot of colleagues<br>especially with my colleague associate<br>professor Deborah Waters is in<br>communitybased exercise programs to<br>prevent Falls and older adults so the<br>one study we were involved in we eval<br>evaluated the use of taii which is form<br>of martial arts which is movement to<br>encourage um people to move to reduce<br>falling and older adults at risk of<br>falling 683 participants were randomized<br>into TR taii once a week taii twice a<br>week or into a seated class where they<br>just did um very lowlevel exercise no<br>balance and no leg strengthening<br>exercises and they did this for 12<br>weeks the primary outcome measure we<br>used was that<br>reduction in the number of PS over an<br>18mon period it was it Well Done RCT<br>even if I say so myself and it was well<br>powered it was correctly powered and so<br>we were excited for the results and<br>although we reduced Falls rate 5% of<br>Falls per month for each month of the<br>trial there was no significant<br>difference between whether you did<br>chargy twice a week once a week or you<br>did the control seated um uh exercise<br>class everyone reduced<br>Falls so movement had worked across all<br>three<br>groups we did ask our group did you<br>continue with exercise after the end of<br>the 12 weeks um intervention and they<br>and we were really delighted that 50% of<br>them were still exercising 17 months<br>later so we had got some movement for<br>so in focus groups we asked<br>participants what they thought would be<br>important to keep them engaged in<br>exercise and physical activity and what<br>they said was they really valued health<br>professionals advice what the exercises<br>needed to be what it consisted of the<br>level of activity activity how intensive<br>and regularly they should<br>exercise they really laed qu quality<br>exercise programs conducive class<br>environments well well trained leaders<br>who ensured that they were safe and the<br>exercise suitably and they wanted health<br>professionals to encourage them and to<br>help them problem solve barriers to<br>getting ex being involved in exercise<br>I.E they needed<br>support we then went on to um try do a<br>randomized control trial in water-based<br>exercise CU we found with taii that a<br>number of the uh participants who had um<br>painful lower limbs due to ostearthritis<br>found the TA Chi when you're in this<br>position and you're moving in a squat<br>position quite painful so we thought the<br>buoyancy of water if they did the<br>exercises in water and warmth and<br>buoyancy would be beneficial so this<br>time we randomize we were looking at<br>reduced risk of falling uh of improving<br>balance and so we randomized 39 people<br>to either water-based exercises which<br>were balance that improved balance and<br>lower leg string Lum strength or the<br>control group were randomized to senior<br>net where they learned computer skills<br>from peers so they both got the equal<br>number of Engagement but the one group<br>was seated and the one group were moving<br>and they did that for 12<br>weeks and at the end of it they improved<br>their balance but there was no<br>significant difference between the<br>results for anybody although they did<br>improve their balance<br>and the I I was unblinded so in<br>randomized control trials people are<br>blinded but I wasn't so I was able to go<br>to the to the uh the waterbased classes<br>to see that everyone was doing what they<br>were supposed to be doing and I watched<br>them over series of time and they<br>improved their ballots imp no their<br>confidence improved their movement<br>improved they were improving but we<br>weren't showing it with our tests and so<br>I asked them in focus groups and they<br>loved it and they swore Bri and I said<br>well the stud's over now how are you<br>going to keep it going and they said oh<br>well water-based exercise is quite<br>expensive they could pay for some of it<br>but not all of it and they were a bit<br>anxious about now continuing at the<br>school at the pool without the<br>instructor there they felt a bit<br>embarrassed exercising on their own and<br>they were anxious if something were to<br>happen so we said to them well what if<br>you went with a buddy or what if we<br>trained someone we you got some training<br>for a short while and then you continued<br>on your own or what if we got a<br>voluntary instructor or peer lead um<br>instructor and they didn't want to Bar<br>of that what was really important to<br>them was having that instructor that<br>trained instructor there so again<br>movement was good but so was the<br>support then another trial that we were<br>involved in also on um in uh Falls<br>prevention was that we evaluated the<br>steady as you go program in denen now<br>this is run by aged concern at Taro and<br>what happens is that they Community<br>Based exercise classes aged concern<br>train an instructor who's trained by us<br>in the school of Physiotherapy in<br>delivering an exercise class they<br>deliver it once a week for 10 weeks and<br>then while the class is on the go they<br>try and identify someone in the class<br>who seems to be really onto it and<br>enjoying it and they convince that<br>person to lead the class so they become<br>peer leid<br>classes and these class classes have<br>been really really successful they<br>started in 2003 and now they're over 40<br>classes um across otago and with they<br>starting classes up now in the north<br>Ireland so we were asked to evaluate<br>whether they actually did anything and<br>um unfortunately because of the<br>successful roll out of these classes we<br>couldn't do a randomized control trial<br>because there were no controls under<br>needen so we had to do a control trial<br>where we didn't randomize them and we<br>found that it did improve and maintain<br>measures of low limb strength and<br>balance so because it's field research<br>we had a quasi test for lower limb<br>strength and that is you get the person<br>to stand up and sit down from a a norm<br>standard chair and you see how many<br>times they can do that in 30 seconds<br>without using the arms and then to<br>measure and balance we got them to do<br>the step test where they have a little<br>step in front of them they stand on one<br>leg and they see how many times they can<br>do that in 15 seconds so they got a<br>balance on one leg and we had three<br>groups we had the group that were the<br>peer Le groups and they had come um they<br>just come off their Christmas break for<br>two months so you can see they started<br>quite well and they just got a bit<br>better and they well over normative data<br>the age con the new age concern classes<br>with the age concern instructors started<br>a bit lower but improved and we're well<br>above normative data whereas our control<br>group which were the seated exercise<br>programs that we ran in belua and omaru<br>remained the same lost my mouth and the<br>same for the step test and those changes<br>were<br>significant and again we asked and this<br>is beatric Hal and and Linda Robertson<br>um ran focus groups and said to<br>participants what they thought was<br>successful about these classes and<br>participants thought really it gave them<br>a lot of um confidence and movement they<br>could do things like reach the top of<br>their window to clean it without getting<br>on the step now I don't think they<br>should have been getting on the step and<br>I wouldn't clean windows but anyway they<br>don't have to pull on the seat when<br>standing up at church or stand on or<br>stand you know hold on when standing but<br>what they really loved was the support<br>that they got from the instructors<br>whether the peer leaders or trained ones<br>who were very caring and kept track of<br>everybody and that's a good thing I<br>won't help the exercise but it helps the<br>confidence to know that somebody is<br>worrying and caring which I think is the<br>big thing with people on their<br>own we went on with Linda and Beatrice's<br>help primarily to explore the social<br>aspects of these classes and this time<br>we used the peer leaders as researchers<br>and they did the interviews we're<br>trained to do the interviews and helped<br>with um analyzing the<br>data and um notice that the oldest peer<br>leader is 92 years old at the time and<br>he was running classes and from this<br>research we found that although the<br>exercises enabled mobility and movement<br>it buils social resilience social<br>capital and uh social confidence and<br>social capital and so again that<br>movement and support support from the<br>peer leaders from themselves was very re<br>really<br>important so what do we learn from all<br>our FAL prevention research do we need<br>an active or an inactive control does it<br>matter what you do as long as you do<br>something even if you get out of your<br>house just to go to um senior net and<br>learn some skills the act of getting out<br>the house and getting there might be<br>enough to help prevent Falls I don't<br>know I'm just putting that out there but<br>really it was the support so really it's<br>is it the choice of the intervention or<br>just getting the person out and the BART<br>and supporting them in their choice of<br>do along with uh Bridget murphin Beach<br>and Gareth toan we um Extended this<br>learning to people with intellectual<br>disabilities who are a very vulnerable<br>group who have frequently fall and have<br>tremendous inj or very um dire injuries<br>they often fall straight forwards onto<br>their faces break teeth which has<br>problems with um with feeding head<br>injuries and there's very little done in<br>falce prevention for people with<br>intellectual disability so we used our<br>learnings to develop a physiotherapy<br>based<br>intervention that provides legs muscle<br>strengthening and balance and we ask<br>people if they would be involved in a<br>physical activity of choice because we<br>know that choice is important now we<br>wanted to make it really easy for people<br>with intellectual disability to um to<br>engage with the exercises so we just um<br>got the physios to choose two or three<br>really key exercises that do lower limb<br>strengthening and balance and we asked<br>them to incorporate as part of their<br>daily routine so people so we said to<br>them you know you get up you might go to<br>the L wash your face brush your teeth do<br>your exercises and then you can get on<br>with the day so we try to do that<br>ingrain that um seven days of the week<br>including<br>Sundays and we also knew that education<br>was important so part of the<br>intervention was training family and<br>support staff on how important it is to<br>do regular exercise and how to help we<br>also created an easy read um brocher to<br>try and get the message across to our<br>participants the physio only had to um<br>visit two or three times because we<br>wanted to keep the cost of physiotherapy<br>intervention low but then they supported<br>the person over 6 months either by<br>telephone or email or cell phone just<br>phoning up regularly hard the exercises<br>going do we need to improve them you<br>know do you need a bit more and we<br>evaluated with um health research<br>Council funding in a feasibility trial<br>just to look at acceptability and<br>whether we thought it might work um we<br>didn't have a control group in this<br>study so evaluated in 30 people with<br>intellectual<br>disability and we did show a significant<br>Improvement in one of the measures of<br>balance and people did engage even the<br>most intellectually um<br>uh challenged or impaired people were<br>able to do some exercise and get<br>involved the physio had to think out the<br>box they had to use a lot of equipment<br>to get people to exercise um I think one<br>of the exercises was the person was<br>quite happy to carry a laundry basket<br>and hang up washing he did it so that<br>was the exercise they did get bored with<br>the exercises doing it every day for six<br>months and life got in the<br>way and the message of increasing<br>physical activity was taken on board and<br>in spite of our last little brochure for<br>people it did not last longer than the<br>research so when the research stopped<br>they stopped exercising and we said why<br>well the research has stopped but you<br>found it so useful and beneficial why<br>don't you continue well the research<br>self-efficacy so all very good he's<br>saying but what happened to your passion<br>so we've used the same sort of um line<br>of inquiry with PE people with multiple<br>sclerosis which is a very prevalent<br>disease in New Zealand especially here<br>iseland we know there's irrefutable<br>robust evidence that exercise benefits<br>people with multiple sclerosis it can um<br>it has functional benefits there's um<br>evidence it's some brain health neurop<br>protection and it can be<br>anti-inflammatory and reduce<br>pro-inflammatory responses we know that<br>but Ms is a progressive lifelong disease<br>so how do you get people to exercise<br>lifelong um and keep them engaged in<br>it this time I worked with um Dr CMI and<br>I must just say that tell me what you<br>want what you really want wasn't my idea<br>it was C's idea I've got to say that<br>it wasn't mine but she was part of the<br>the<br>paper so with with kth and GIS Jan and<br>Hilda Mulligan we developed a<br>physiotherapy intervention for people<br>with MS and this was aimed at trying to<br>just engage people in exercise and so<br>that they would stay in it<br>lifelong so first of all we consulted<br>Nationwide with people of Ms and MS<br>Society Etc and we did two qualitative<br>interviews and what we found is that<br>people with Ms do want to exercise they<br>value exercise they're not very fussed<br>on the physiotherapy exercise programs<br>that we give them where we get them to<br>do 10 whoops we're physio so we have to<br>move where you might get them to do 10<br>exercises like this and 10 exercises<br>like this they wanted to do what they<br>wanted to do they wanted choice and they<br>wanted control and ownership they didn't<br>want us to tell them you've got to do it<br>three times a week and you've got to do<br>10 repetitions and irrespective you've<br>got to keep going they wanted to know<br>that they could do what they wanted to<br>do depending on how they feel because<br>fatigue is a big issue with multiple<br>sclerosis they valued physiotherapy<br>support and they valued Our advice but<br>they wanted us to support them in what<br>they chose to<br>do so that's what we did we'd go and<br>visit people using motivational<br>interviewing saying what would you like<br>to do how can we help you do it and then<br>we followed them for 6 months and we<br>showed with the feasibility study again<br>no control group that um we<br>significantly reduce the impact of Ms on<br>their lives it was a feasibility<br>study and as usual we asked participants<br>at the end what they thought of our<br>intervention and they really again<br>enjoyed the selfefficacy that we<br>developed for them help them develop<br>should I say and the physiotherapy<br>support so things like just knowing that<br>people care I mean they're not just<br>there to do their job they care whether<br>you progress and how you are it's quite<br>nice to think that someone's kindly<br>following you along the line it's made<br>me so determined to do more exercise so<br>again there's that supportive um<br>supportive role that we<br>play have we progressed um blue<br>prescription well we presently in a<br>trial a very small RCT because we only<br>got a little bit of funding uh nothing<br>against phys therapy New Zealand<br>sorry but<br>sorry we we tried to get health research<br>Council funding to do a fully P RCT so<br>we had to do we had to cut our cloth<br>Joe and we we're trialing blue<br>prescription with people living with<br>lifelong<br>disabilities and so far we've done a bit<br>of qualitative it's presently on the go<br>and the physiotherapist has told us that<br>she's taken on a coaching role to help<br>people get involved in exercise and help<br>them especially in people living with<br>long-term conditions and disability a<br>lot of them have comorbidities they have<br>lots of conditions so it's really<br>struggling trying to find them help them<br>struggle um through barriers to<br>exercise and again the patients say it's<br>quite nice having someone kindly<br>following you along the line so gain<br>that movement and support<br>so that made me think about support how<br>do we support people with um with<br>chronic conditions and my Reflections<br>led me to um involvement with the<br>bridges stroke self management program<br>that was developed by Professor Fiona<br>Jones in London and this program trains<br>health professionals to work in ways<br>that help individuals with stroke and<br>with other long-term conditions to take<br>control over the rehabilitation to resle<br>the control back from the health<br>professionals<br>and um this is aided by stroke workbook<br>so it's a combination of training health<br>professionals and it's aided by stroke<br>workbook and we've done work so far<br>again funded by physiotherapy New<br>Zealand thank you<br>um to kiwii this London based program so<br>the stroke book was um had London<br>examples in it we've collected kiwi<br>examples a lot of them are denan<br>examples in the workbook and we've asked<br>people with broke across the country<br>whether they think it's something they<br>they would like to be involved in and<br>they said that that they would so at the<br>moment we're presently trying to roll<br>out the training to health professionals<br>across New Zealand and we trained our<br>back our research findings have um<br>around engaging healthy and um healthy<br>and engaging lives through movement and<br>support has now been embedded into our<br>neuro rehabilitation teaching and<br>community outreach um that Kath and I<br>have developed at the school and so<br>we've as Dave said we've established an<br>Interactive Learning initiative where<br>students under our supervision assist<br>people with neurological dysfunction to<br>work towards health and fitness<br>goals so I hopefully I've convinced you<br>that physiotherapists play an extremely<br>important role in enabling people<br>through movement but that merely<br>prescribing exercise is not enough that<br>building self-efficacy through<br>confidence and ongoing support is<br>crucial to achieve movement for life now<br>I can hear a lot of the quantitative<br>people sitting out there saying no she<br>hasn't she's just given us soft evidence<br>where is the hard quantitative evidence<br>that we can do<br>this and I'm going to throw to you that<br>I don't think rcts are going to show<br>what we want to achieve I don't think<br>they're going to help us impr uh prove<br>what we want to do and let me explain<br>very briefly<br>recently um in February a large trial<br>released its um results the iare trial<br>this was a trial that looked at Upper<br>Limb um movement after stroke it was<br>very high intensity exercise for people<br>poststroke for the Upper Limb thinking<br>that the more you do the better the<br>outcome will be and it built in<br>self-efficacy as well this trial um cost<br>13 million American Dollar and I I<br>stayed with the lead investigator in<br>February it ran from from from when they<br>had Inception to now when they released<br>the results it was over 8 years they had<br>to um screen over a thousand people to<br>get down to 361 people to power it<br>properly from all the from big cities of<br>Los Angeles and Washington DC and<br>Atlanta we can't do that in Eden we're<br>too small um and then when they released<br>the results there was no significant<br>difference between those that were in<br>the experimental group that had twice<br>the amount of motor um intervention and<br>support than the control group and I<br>said to Steve wolf you must be so<br>disappointed in the results and he said<br>no after 8 years people learned and<br>Rehabilitation the control groups<br>changed so no longer were they<br>differentiated cuz over for that length<br>of time you can't stop Rehabilitation<br>they presented the results that have<br>been rolled<br>out my point is and and I mean they<br>they'll disect these results and they'll<br>say some subgroups did improve but you<br>know what they're going to need so much<br>more time and money to prove that the<br>subgroups which subgroups<br>improved and my point is not so much<br>against ICT it's just I think so much<br>money so much<br>time the by the time the results are<br>released the world of Rehabilitation has<br>moved on you you you behind now again<br>very disappointingly the biggest<br>physiotherapy trial has just just<br>released its results a couple of weeks<br>ago this was a massive at Bas in<br>Australia um they had to screen quarter<br>of a million people with stroke across<br>50 hospitals across eight countries in<br>order to get enough people to 2,000<br>people to be able to power the study<br>statistically to get statistically valid<br>results and the the question was if<br>you've had a stroke if we mobilize you<br>very early um within 24 hours of your<br>stroke and frequently will you have<br>better<br>outcomes um than if we delayed<br>mobilization out of bed and you know<br>what they found that if you mobilize<br>someone over 20 um after the 24-hour<br>period and only little bits of<br>mobilization out of bed the results were<br>better than very frequent less than 24<br>hours after stroke again really<br>disappointing results but you know what<br>the message of early early mobilization<br>after stroke when I trained I think we<br>used to leave them flat for 10 days in<br>bed before we got someone out of bed so<br>this was new 24 hours I think<br>um people had started changing their<br>practice so it wasn't that it didn't<br>work it probably was more that the<br>control group were doing more and more<br>and more there will be heaps of data<br>come this is just the early um results<br>this will change clinical guidelines for<br>rehabilitation for stroke I'm sure and<br>there'll be lots of results coming out<br>of it but again I ask you such a long<br>time and so much money I wouldn't like<br>to know how much that cost that trial<br>and again is so is the ICT the way we're<br>going to prove that enabling movement um<br>helps our<br>people but we do know movement Works um<br>physical inactivity is now built as more<br>dangerous to health than smoking<br>resulting in a pandemic of<br>non-communicable diseases and we see<br>more and more statements such as this<br>come out for example the four main<br>non-communicable diseases with the<br>highest incidence of mortality or<br>cardiovascular disease chronic<br>respiratory disease diabetes and cancer<br>and these four diseases account for 80%<br>of all deaths from non-communicable<br>diseases 29 million people per year each<br>year about 1.9 million people die as a<br>result of physical inactivity<br>worldwide and of course with the dire<br>warnings of the tsunami of the number of<br>older adults that are coming with living<br>with<br>keep people happy I mean keep people<br>healthy in<br>alive and we know that doing um 30<br>minutes of exercise on most days of the<br>week at least three times a week will<br>reduce your risk of getting a<br>non-communicable disease and in fact<br>along with stopping smoking physical<br>inactivity is build as one of the least<br>expensive and most productive Health<br>public even World Confederation of<br>physical therapists states that physical<br>therapists work with a wide range of<br>people to optimize their physical<br>activity from Elite athletes to older<br>people seeking to remain active as they<br>age more than any other profession they<br>prevent chronic disease by helping<br>people become more<br>active so I'll end with this<br>thought so not only do physiotherapists<br>enable healthy and engaging lives<br>through movement and support there are<br>now more than Rehabilitation<br>Rehabilitation ISS they are now one of<br>the leading health professionals engaged<br>in combating the health pandemics of the<br>21st century and we will do this through<br>movement and support for<br>life but before I invite questions I<br>would like to acknowledge a lot of<br>people I haven't made got to this Pro um<br>got my uh promotion and made it to this<br>inaugural profitorial Leal without all<br>the support and there's so many people I<br>can't hope to name everyone so all my<br>participants all my colleagues and<br>there's plenty sitting in here uh<br>sitting in the hall tonight students as<br>well have helped me from undergrads to<br>PhD students I've had so much help from<br>the physiotherapy department at the<br>University of vant and from my own<br>Department here at Chago and I've had a<br>number of funders that have funded my<br>research but the people I'd like to<br>thank the most who have supported me the<br>most are<br>three very special people in my my life<br>and that's my husband alen my daughter<br>Jennifer and Michelle so thank you for<br>your support and getting me here<br>but this support has come at a cost and<br>so the cost I must as things usually do<br>and so I do really want to acknowledge<br>four very special people who who<br>supported our move to New Zealand are<br>supported our move to New Zealand but<br>unfort L that's that's alen and my<br>parents who we lost all four of them in<br>the last um 18 months so we'd like to<br>acknowledge their support for bringing<br>us here so Kiora and thank you<br>on behalf of all of us I very warm and<br>heartfelt thank you for your lecture um<br>a number of things immediately spring to<br>mind<br>um the first is that as you may be aware<br>the university is host to one of the<br>National Science challenges uh for aging<br>well and a lot of what Lee's been<br>talking about this evening is<br>particularly relevant to that group as<br>we look at people living longer and the<br>population structure changing the<br>importance of keeping people healthy of<br>keeping them engaged and keeping them<br>moving will become bigger and<br>bigger there's this longevity dividend<br>that we've inherited and it will<br>continue but unless we work hard to<br>ensure that people have meaningful lives<br>and engaged lives then we will have lost<br>the a great opportunity and for New<br>Zealand this is something for the future<br>on which we need to focus the other<br>thing that I take away from this evening<br>is most people accept that movement<br>physical activity exercise is good for<br>them but I have to say and I'm looking<br>around the room to make eye contact with<br>a student or two this is not just a<br>problem of older people not meeting<br>their<br>guidelines work from our own Clinic<br>indicates that our students less than<br>50% meet physical activity guidelines so<br>they're no better nor worse than the<br>Aging population so an encourage<br>enouragement now if you want to live a<br>long productive life get the trainers on<br>and get<br>outside finally and there's two<br>Dimensions to this um it's accepted that<br>focusing exclusively on goals and less<br>on processes leads to your life where<br>you are continually frustrated that you<br>can't make the perfect golf swing you<br>can't play the note the way you wanted<br>to or whatever focusing on enjoying the<br>process is very very important and you<br>will have got that from the feedback and<br>the qualitative results from these<br>studies the engagement is really what's<br>important to people who have these<br>disabilities and these populations with<br>whom Lee and her colleagues have been<br>working it's equally important and<br>here's a a message to students and<br>Junior researchers that you enjoy the<br>process uh the accolades such as this<br>evening come from really dedicating<br>yourself to and enjoying what you're<br>doing and hopefully you've learned a<br>little from Lee's example this evening<br>so Lee on behalf of us all thank you<br>presents I've got too many presents um<br>it's a tradition at the University that<br>the um inaugural professorial lecture is<br>given a copy of the a framed<br>copy of their poster to stick on their<br>wall cheesy<br>photog I think it's a great<br>photograph we also give you something to<br>celebrate across at the University<br>Bookstore<br>oh um and on behalf of your colleagues<br>at the school uh this is something else<br>to hang on your wall and last but not<br>least<br>um our student executive asked me to<br>present you with this oh that's very<br>kind of them I see the taken on the<br>messages about healthy eating inside<br>your so well done in that join me again<br>in thanking Lee for her<br>lecture too many presents<br>here Koto my name is Kon I'm the pro<br>Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences and<br>it remains to me to um add my words of<br>thanks to Lee for an absolutely<br>excellent talk and to also thank you<br>before I do that I would actually like<br>to acknowledge a point made by David<br>earlier on and that is that Lee is<br>taking over as the role of Dean of the<br>school of<br>Physiotherapy and that's after David has<br>been in the role for 10 years and 10<br>years is the maximum allowed for those<br>senior leadership roles at our<br>University so David has built the School<br>up uh to a um to its very very strong<br>position now it has a national and<br>international reputation which is very<br>welld deserved and now Lee will be<br>taking over as the dean very shortly in<br>51 days in fact and how many hours and<br>seconds<br>David and for myself I very much look<br>forward to working with Lee in that new<br>role I think we'll have a very good time<br>working together Lee and I know the<br>senior leadership uh Team of the<br>division of Health Science looks forward<br>to working with you as well so thank you<br>again for your<br>presentation and welcome very shortly to<br>the role of<br>Dean so thank you to you thank you to<br>Lee's family this is a very special<br>occasion and we're so pleased you're<br>able to join us thank you for traveling<br>to be with us thank you to our<br>distinguished guests who were with us<br>today um representing the profession and<br>uh these uh professional and academic<br>colleagues thank you to our University<br>colleagues for being here thank you to<br>members of the community and thank you<br>to friends um I'd like to invite<br>everyone now to join us for drinks and<br>the staff Club just across the way thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
