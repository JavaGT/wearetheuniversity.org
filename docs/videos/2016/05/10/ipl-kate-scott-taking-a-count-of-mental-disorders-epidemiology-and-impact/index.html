Recorded 3 November 2015.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>podcast kiot and good evening um for<br>those of you who do not know me my name<br>is harleen Hayne and I have the great<br>privilege of being the vice Chancellor<br>here at the University of itago on<br>behalf of the University it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome everyone who is here<br>this evening it's fantastic to see staff<br>and students from the University of at<br>um and it's also fantastic to see people<br>from the community who are also coming<br>to support um Kate tonight on her big<br>evening I'd also like to acknowledge two<br>members of Kate's family who are in the<br>audience this evening um her partner is<br>here as well as her sister and the fact<br>that these have become family Affairs I<br>think is a very clear indication of The<br>Importance of Being promoted to<br>Professor here at the University of<br>atago we are here tonight to celebrate<br>Kate Scott's promotion to Professor um<br>and to give her the opportunity to share<br>with us some of her fantastic research<br>findings I just want to remind people in<br>the audience um how difficult it is to<br>become a professor here at aago um in<br>order to reach this Milestone you must<br>show excellence in teaching in research<br>and in service to the university and the<br>broader community and clearly Professor<br>Scott has met those<br>Milestones she is internationally<br>recognized for her work work on the<br>interplay between mental health and<br>co-morbid physical health she's received<br>substantial prior support for the h from<br>the HRC for her<br>research she currently has as of Sunday<br>over 4,000 citations to her work and an<br>H index over<br>30 she's also a fantastic teacher<br>particularly in terms of Behavioral<br>Science teaching within the school uh<br>denan School of Medicine um where she<br>holds full responsibility for the<br>curriculum for the course planning<br>assessment and allocation of teaching<br>and she's also excelled in terms of<br>service uh Professor Scott is a member<br>of the University of itago Health Ethics<br>Committee um she is also the associate<br>editor of cardiovascular psychology and<br>neurology and she represents New Zealand<br>on the World Health organization's World<br>mental health surveys<br>Consortium in closing I would also like<br>to note that Professor Scott is a great<br>example of the value of abroad<br>education although her final degree is<br>from Cambridge um in she also um has<br>first degrees in an honors degree in<br>Psychology and a ba in English<br>literature and I think that that's a<br>great example for the way in which we<br>must continue to fiercely defend the<br>broad level of Education that is<br>available here to our students at the<br>University of itago no matter what field<br>they ultimately end up studying so on<br>behalf of the University of itago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you<br>Professor Scott on your well-earned<br>promotion and I would like to call on<br>the dean of the denan school of medicine<br>Professor Barry Taylor to tell us just a<br>little bit more about your journey in<br>getting<br>here so it's my pleasure to um further<br>introduce Kate Scott I usually before<br>these lectures uh interview the person<br>and um so I had that pleasure yesterday<br>to sit down with Kate and or stand up<br>with Kate um and uh ask her about her<br>career and how she got to where she's<br>got and uh you've heard and I'm not<br>going to repeat everything that Haren<br>saids she tells me that she's an<br>introvert and actually doesn't like<br>publicity um and that uh she started uh<br>doing a ba in as you say English<br>literature in Victoria uh and then went<br>overseas and taught overseas in Finland<br>and in Egypt uh before deciding what she<br>wanted to do so the bread uh started<br>very broad right at the beginning came<br>back to Victoria and uh and decided that<br>she wanted to do Clinical Psychology uh<br>did the um BC the the honors degree in<br>Psychology and then uh ma in Psychology<br>and then started some practice uh as a<br>clinical psychologist in the Wellington<br>area<br>um she said that that was the time when<br>research started to attract her um the<br>exposure pers in that honors year and<br>then uh doing the Masters to research<br>ideas and their finding out of new ideas<br>and that she's never really lost<br>interest in that in the research side of<br>things since that time in fact looking<br>at her CV things grew really from that<br>stage and her activity in terms of<br>finding out new things really has<br>expanded really from that time as she<br>goes through the rest of her career so<br>she was exposed to clinical um uh I<br>guess work as a con uh a clinical<br>psychologist working with the liaison<br>team in Wellington hospital so seeing a<br>wide range of people who have<br>psychological issues as well as physical<br>illness so that started her broad<br>interest ongoing um between the mind and<br>the body and the fact that she would see<br>in that liaison Psychiatry sort of<br>situation uh people who have both<br>chronic uh ongoing illness physical<br>illness and how that relates to mental<br>health and vice versa as they certainly<br>interrelate uh in a in a very real way<br>so that remain interest and you'll see<br>that as she comes to her talk that she<br>will bring together the physical and the<br>mental health issues that that have<br>remained her passion so the clinical<br>work um then morphed into a period with<br>an agency which I actually held in high<br>respect the public health intelligence<br>unit uh at the Ministry of Health which<br>no longer exists uh illustrating that<br>Ministry keeps changing um but that was<br>actually a really interesting and good<br>unit she worked there for four years um<br>working on the mental health survey<br>which she's going to talk quite a lot<br>about today um a period of actually you<br>know focused with within the Ministry of<br>Health environment and actually um<br>survey and and linking in with intern<br>other International surveys that uh that<br>in fact uh ended up with a similar<br>design so that they could be comparison<br>leading in fact to her main research<br>area uh at the moment which is actually<br>comparison of what happens in different<br>countries especially in the mental<br>health area so uh you can sort of see<br>the progression as she goes get some<br>work experience in different areas and<br>how that then becomes relevant to the<br>research questions that she tries to<br>answer um after that period She then<br>joined the Wellington uh uh uh school um<br>university of atago Wellington um as a<br>uh senior lecturer uh and um and in that<br>time went from a point5 appointment to a<br>point8 appointment uh continued the<br>interest in the clinical problems that<br>she'd<br>previously been exposed to um and um<br>really was there for a 10-year period<br>from 2000 to 2010 before we recruited<br>here down to the denan school of<br>medicine to run our behavioral um you<br>part of the Department of psychological<br>medicine um at which stage she was<br>associate professor and then this year<br>being promoted to um Professor so you<br>can see the story evolving of somebody<br>who actually uses is the the experience<br>that she's had to decide on what she<br>wants to do uh and to answer the<br>research questions that come up related<br>to her everyday work she's going to talk<br>today a bit about that Mind Body<br>interface the International Studies that<br>I mentioned uh and uh also another<br>interest that she has around gender<br>disparities and what in fact might<br>underpin uh the differences especially<br>in mental health between um uh people<br>with different genders so I'm really<br>looking forward to the talk and I hope<br>you all are as well it's a fascinating<br>topic area and Co I I invite you to come<br>and give your inaugural address thank<br>much good evening everybody and thank<br>you very much for coming and thank you<br>to uh Professor Taylor and Hayne for<br>that very generous<br>introduction so when we study the<br>epidemiology of mental disorders what we<br>are doing is measuring the prevalence of<br>disorders and what that means is the<br>percent of the population who meet the<br>diagnostic criteria for mental disorders<br>at particular points in time and we look<br>at the distribution of disorders in<br>society so we look at which<br>socioeconomic groups have higher or or<br>lower prevalence of disorders and we<br>also collect information on the risk<br>factors for disorders so that we can get<br>some sense of how these problems are<br>coming about now we have to do surveys<br>we have to you know achieve all of that<br>through surveys we can't simply go to<br>treatment data and count the number of<br>people who have been treated for mental<br>disorders because actually the majority<br>of people meeting the criteria for<br>mental disorders don't seek treatment so<br>we actually have to go out there and<br>knock on doors and interview people<br>about their mental health uh and this is<br>quite challenging to do so to arrive at<br>kind of statistically robust estimates<br>of prevalence you need large samples<br>they need to be representative of the<br>whole country so in New Zealand we have<br>to go into the rural areas as well as<br>the urban urban areas we need a high<br>response rate so what that means is of<br>all of the people we approach to take<br>part in the survey a large proportion<br>have to agree because what we know from<br>other research is that the people who<br>are less likely to agree to take part<br>are more likely to have mental disorders<br>so if we end up with a low response rate<br>that can bias our prevalence<br>estimates the interview ends up being<br>long if you're looking at a lot of<br>mental disorders as we did in New<br>Zealand uh the interviews are very long<br>so even amongst people who have no<br>mental health problems the interview<br>usually ends up being 45 minutes or an<br>hour which means that amongst people who<br>do have mental health problems the<br>interviews are several<br>hours it has to be done in person for<br>that reason because of the length of the<br>interview you can't just do it over the<br>telephone and all of this means that<br>that these kinds of things are very<br>expensive to do which is why we do not<br>have a long tradition of them in New<br>Zealand uh and in fact we have only ever<br>done one National survey that is talaro<br>the New Zealand mental health survey the<br>data were collected in 2004 so over the<br>whole of that year we had about 100<br>interviewers uh collecting data for for<br>the full 12 months and the results were<br>released in about<br>2006 we achieved a large sample it's<br>nearly 13,000 is actually the single<br>largest face-to-face Health survey<br>that's been undertaken in New Zealand we<br>oversampled Mari and Pacific people<br>relative to their population proportions<br>uh and we did achieve uh a very good<br>response rate so that's terrific and you<br>know these data are actually getting<br>kind of old uh but uh the Ministry of<br>Health have indicated to me this year<br>that they were so this survey was so<br>eye-wateringly expensive to condu to<br>conduct it's unlikely to be doing<br>another such survey anytime soon so it's<br>just as well the data are<br>sound so just to tell you some of the<br>the briefly some of the results from the<br>survey what we see is uh in terms of<br>12-month prevalence so what 12-month<br>prevalence means this is the percent of<br>the population meeting diagnostic<br>criteria for any of these disorders in<br>at some time in the 12 months prior to<br>interview so you can see from that the<br>total column and that 14.8 for any<br>anxiety disorder so that means that<br>nearly 15% % of the New Zealand<br>population met the diagnostic criteria<br>for one of the anxiety disorders that we<br>surveyed uh at some stage in the prior<br>12 months so now that's quite a it's a<br>big percent and it's quite a big group<br>of s of uh anxiety disorders there are<br>seven different anxiety disorders so<br>these are things like obsessive<br>compulsive disorder post-traumatic<br>stress disorder specific and social<br>phobia panic disorder agrop phobia<br>generalized anxiety disorder these are<br>the anxiety<br>disorders so the 8% for any mood<br>disorder this includes depression and<br>bipolar disorder and depression is the<br>more prevalent so<br>5.5% of the New Zealand population meet<br>the criteria for depression in the past<br>12 months so depression is actually the<br>single most prevalent disorder in the<br>New Zealand population substance use<br>disord so what this refers to is alcohol<br>and drug abuse and dependence a lower<br>prevalence as you can see that might<br>come as a surprise you have to consider<br>that as kind of the tip of the iceberg<br>really of our problems with substance<br>use in New Zealand it's probably a<br>little bit lower uh than we expected we<br>think perhaps that the diagnostic<br>threshold ended up being set a little<br>bit too high in terms of the questions<br>that we used also denial is quite a<br>feature of these disorders particularly<br>in the early years uh and that of course<br>can affect people's willingness to<br>disclose the problems that they have<br>Eating Disorders these are this is<br>anorexia and bulimia as you can see very<br>low prevalence although these are severe<br>disorders and so any of those disorders<br>uh 20.7% so you know one in five of the<br>New Zealand population meeting the<br>criteria for one of these disorders in<br>the past 12 months so you know that<br>that's quite a significant proportion<br>and that's the 12-month prevalence<br>because actually if we look to the<br>lifetime prevalence or lifetime risk of<br>having a disorder then it's more really<br>more like 40 to<br>50% now schizophrenia is not there some<br>of you may be noticing that or The<br>Psychotic disorders generally uh and<br>that is because<br>the we were sampling the<br>non-institutionalized population of New<br>Zealand and a lot of people with<br>schizophrenia live in the kinds of<br>Institutions that would not have been<br>part of our sampling frame uh so that<br>that would have kind of biased our<br>estimates but we know from other<br>research that the prevalence of<br>schizophrenia is quite similar to eating<br>disorders it's probably around about<br>half a percent or a bit less so it<br>wouldn't have made a big difference to<br>the overall<br>prevalence now two interesting patterns<br>to note there in this table one is the<br>age pattern so what we can see is that<br>the prevalence of mental disorders<br>decreases with increasing age this is<br>not a novel Finding this is a standard<br>finding we've found the same thing in<br>many surveys of this type you know this<br>is really the good news secret about<br>aging I think it's this is not well<br>understood you know there's no doubt<br>that physical health deteriorates as you<br>get older and unfortunately probably<br>cognitive Health as well so simply the<br>prevalence of cognitive disorders like<br>dementia goes upward with increasing age<br>but mental health problems<br>don't uh and in fact there's you know<br>there's quite a lot of experimental<br>psychology research to kind of back that<br>up where uh age related differences have<br>been OBS observed in the kinds of things<br>that we choose to pay attention to as we<br>age uh and the way we we react to things<br>changes that are probably protective of<br>our mental<br>health um the gender differences too I<br>just want to point out so you can see<br>there that that women have higher r of<br>anxiety disorders and of mood disorders<br>it's actually just of depression not<br>bipolar disorder that's about equal in<br>men and women but women have higher<br>rates of depression and I'm going to<br>come back to those gender differences a<br>little bit later in my talk men have<br>higher rates of substance use disorders<br>which won't come as any surprise and<br>disorders and just one other table from<br>the New Zealand survey just to look at<br>the kind of distribution of disorders<br>across Society because this is actually<br>you know really important information to<br>take on I think so when we look at the<br>prevalence of any 12-month disorder you<br>can see that it is somewhat higher<br>amongst people with less education and<br>we have ways of classifying disorders by<br>severity so we were able to sort of uh<br>determine we're we able to categorize<br>the disorders uh as either severe or<br>moderate or mild uh and when we just<br>look at the people with severe disorders<br>you can see that uh that that um kind of<br>disparity across education groups is<br>even more pronounced amongst people with<br>severe disorders and the same pattern<br>for income so the prevalence of any<br>disorder uh is higher amongst people<br>with lower income uh and that pattern is<br>further accentuated amongst people with<br>severe disorders when there's where<br>there's really quite a<br>discrepancy now in terms of ethnicity um<br>you know the Ministry of Health before<br>they uh funded the survey had been<br>extremely worried because the anecdotal<br>evidence had suggested that possibly<br>Mari were going to have much higher<br>rates of mental disorder they do have<br>higher rates as you can see but not much<br>higher so somewhat higher in terms of<br>the prevalence of any 12-month disorder<br>but you know again a slightly greater<br>discrepancy between Mari and the rest of<br>the population when you look at just<br>severe disorders now these prevalence<br>estimates are adjusted for age and sex<br>When We additionally adjust uh those<br>ethnic specific prevalences for uh<br>income and for Education some of that<br>difference between Mari and the rest of<br>the population diminishes but not all so<br>there AR still Mari still have<br>disorders now this New Zealand survey<br>was part of an international<br>collaboration uh called the The Who<br>World mental health surveys initiative<br>and the aim of this big Global project<br>was to provide information on the<br>cross-national epidemiology of mental<br>disorders using a standardized<br>methodology because this had never<br>already been done before and<br>particularly the aim was to try and get<br>information on the epidemiology of<br>disorders in developing countries<br>because really we knew almost nothing<br>about that apart from isolated surveys<br>in a few<br>countries and the way this kind of<br>standardized approach was achieved was<br>that Michigan University took the lead<br>Michigan University are the kind of<br>world leaders uh in survey research<br>methodology and they sent people uh out<br>to each of the contributing countries uh<br>uh and trained the interviewers as they<br>did in New Zealand as well and basically<br>uh had a close eye on in terms of the<br>the quality control of the data<br>collection and what I should just say is<br>that this is actually an ongoing project<br>so we didn't have 31 countries initially<br>uh it started about 15 years ago and<br>countries have been sort of joining the<br>world mental health surve surveys<br>collaboration uh as time has gone on so<br>we're now up to 31<br>countries um and Michigan also sort of<br>helped negotiate some of the quite<br>considerable difficulties uh in terms of<br>the data collection I mean you know the<br>data collection was actually quite<br>challenging in New Zealand but but<br>nothing compared to what it was like<br>collecting data in some of those<br>developing countries Iraq for example is<br>one of the world mental health surveys<br>and the data collection there coincided<br>with the American Invasion which put a<br>stop to things temporarily but then you<br>know they carried on and they finished<br>the data collection which is quite<br>remarkable a number of other countries<br>like Colombia and Mexico uh and some of<br>the other developing countries had<br>particular problems because you know in<br>New Zealand the interviewers used laptop<br>computers to enter the all of the<br>respondents data which made things much<br>more streamlined but in those countries<br>the interviewers couldn't carry around<br>laptop computers because it put them at<br>Great personal risk of being mugged so<br>they had to resort to using paper based<br>questionnaires you know like about it's<br>about this thick the paper based<br>questionnaire so much more complicated<br>so many many logistical hurdles to<br>overcome the overall project management<br>and all of the analytical side was<br>handled uh through Harvard uh medical<br>school Under the direction of the<br>overall IAL investigator uh Ron Kesler<br>so whenever a data um whenever a country<br>finished collecting their data it went<br>off to Harvard where it got cleaned and<br>coded that's kind of massive job in<br>itself uh and Harvard ran all of the<br>diagnostic algorithms and and produced<br>estimates now I'm just showing you here<br>the uh results from the first 17 of the<br>countries to join the collaboration<br>because if I put all the countries up<br>there the slide gets quite messy messy<br>so you can see that the United States<br>has the highest prevalence so you know<br>this is 12mth prevalence of any disorder<br>you remember the New Zealand's<br>20.7% uh so the United States with 27%<br>Ukraine up next primarily driven by<br>their very high rates of substance use<br>disorders which you know any of you have<br>kind of followed what's happened to<br>their use of alcohol after the break up<br>of the Soviet Union won't be surprised<br>at that Colombia next highest and New<br>Zealand pretty high too and I'll come<br>back to that shortly and then if you<br>look at sort of the other end uh of the<br>table you see Nigeria which really came<br>as a surprise I think to all of us<br>because you know when you just think<br>about the kind of news items that we<br>hear about Nigeria with sort of hundreds<br>of school girls being kidnapped and so<br>on I mean Nigeria just just not does not<br>strike you as likely to be a sort of<br>mental health<br>Paradise so what is going on um and the<br>kind of short and unsatisfactory answer<br>to that question is we don't know uh as<br>to what can really be explaining the<br>variation uh in prevalence across<br>countries so I mean the aim of the world<br>mental health surveys was to standardize<br>methodology so that we would be able to<br>then interpret any variation across<br>countries in prevalence in terms of real<br>variation for example in the risk<br>factors for mental<br>disorders hasn't quite worked out that<br>way though because methodological<br>variation always tends to kind of creep<br>in and one of the things that I think<br>has probably happened is that there's<br>the sort of interaction between<br>methodology and culture in some<br>countries that has influenced results so<br>Nigeria for example you know there's<br>been a lot of discussion with the<br>Nigerian principal investigator as to<br>what could be going on could account for<br>the very low prevalence of disorders in<br>that country and he said well you know<br>we don't have a tradition of doing this<br>kind of survey in Nigeria so when<br>somebody from the government comes<br>knocking on the door of people wanting<br>to interview them about their mental<br>health you know people are probably not<br>only a bit startled by that but possibly<br>quite threatened and that really may<br>affect their willingness to disclose the<br>problems that they have and something<br>similar might be going on in the Asian<br>countries Japan and China although these<br>have traditionally had low rates uh of<br>mental disorder but again you know those<br>countries are known for mental disorders<br>being quite highly stigmatized um this<br>need to kind of keep face and possibly<br>that also uh dampens down the prevalence<br>estimates<br>there so there's probably methodological<br>variation which is partly explaining the<br>difference across country but there<br>might also be real variation so let me<br>just touch on New Zealand again New<br>Zealand does unfortunately have high<br>rates of some of the known risk factors<br>for mental disorders and one of those is<br>childhood adversities child maltreatment<br>or child abuse where unfortunately we<br>are amongst the highest amongst oecd<br>countries in that and that is a very<br>well established risk factor for the<br>development of mental disorders New<br>Zealand also has high rates of teen<br>binge drinking uh and drug use these are<br>risk factors not only for the<br>development of substance use disorders<br>but for all of the mental<br>disorders New Zealand in recent years uh<br>also is is quite high in terms of income<br>inequality uh and that is now<br>established by both our data and other<br>studies uh as a risk factor for mental<br>disorders so you know this might be part<br>of the reason why New Zealand's ending<br>up uh rather High<br>there okay I'm going to move now uh from<br>talking about the New Zealand survey in<br>particular oops<br>um and on to talking about two of the<br>areas that I've had the opportunity to<br>explore using the world Mental Health<br>Data and I am going to come on to mental<br>physical links but just a little bit<br>later because I've always had an<br>interest in the gender difference in<br>mental disorders and I'm just focusing<br>on uh depression here so you know as I<br>mentioned in the New Zealand data women<br>have higher rates of depression now that<br>is an absolute bog standard finding it<br>has been found in hundreds and hundreds<br>of studies uh and and when it was first<br>observed probably about 40 years ago it<br>gave rise to what's termed the gender<br>roles hypothesis so this was the idea<br>that maybe women's higher rates of<br>depression could be because they have<br>sort of fewer uh opportunities and and<br>um perhaps less satisfying opportunities<br>career-wise and otherwise in terms of<br>their adult social roles than men now<br>and you know as was perhaps the case<br>some 40 years ago um<br>that hypothesis has kind of fallen or<br>had rather fallen out of favor for two<br>reasons one is because social change has<br>meant that actually women have much<br>greater opportunities now and there's<br>there's more kind of equality with men<br>in terms of uh social roles and career<br>opportunities than they used to be but<br>it's also because there is now much more<br>prominence of strong kind of biological<br>hypotheses biological explanations for<br>the gender difference in depression the<br>most prominent of these being that<br>perhaps the gender difference in<br>depression is a function of sex hormone<br>differences so differences across men<br>and women in the way sex hormones<br>influence<br>mood An Inconvenient finding though for<br>the biological hypothesis has been<br>observed in a number of studies and<br>including our data uh and that is that<br>um in recent times that gender<br>difference seems to be diminishing so<br>there's been this kind of narrowing of<br>the gender differ in depression uh over<br>time so that it's smaller in recent<br>cohorts compared to older cohorts now<br>you can't explain that kind of variation<br>over time in terms of<br>biology and on the face of it it would<br>seem that you know the gender roles uh<br>hypothesis might be quite a good<br>explanation for it if it's the case that<br>you know societal changes have led to<br>Greater opportunities for opportunities<br>for women perhaps this is why this<br>gender difference uh is diminishing<br>but nobody had really been able to test<br>that possibility because they didn't<br>really have the right kind of data and<br>we devised a way of looking at this in<br>the world Mental Health<br>Data and the way we did this was we took<br>the information from uh participants and<br>we worked out what the gender<br>differences were in terms of Education<br>uh in terms of income terms of age at<br>first marriage and we worked that out<br>for four different age groups within<br>each country and we put that information<br>together with information from female<br>participants on the use of birth control<br>and from all of that we constructed a<br>measure of gender role equality that we<br>were able to use to determine the degree<br>of gender role equality operating within<br>each country uh at different time points<br>in their recent history when we' done<br>all of that which took about a year was<br>quite a complex analysis we were then in<br>a position to test this hypothesis and<br>what we found was that that narrowing of<br>the gender difference in depression over<br>time was strongly associated with<br>increasing gender role equality within<br>countries over the same period of<br>time so that was a very interesting<br>finding I think and I'm going to come<br>back to it uh briefly in just a minute<br>but it led on to a related question in<br>my mind about marriage<br>because you know especially uh amongst<br>feminists there's been a lot of<br>discussion about the idea that perhaps<br>you know marriage in modern societies<br>like New Zealand you know marriage is<br>perhaps a sort of Bastion of gender role<br>traditionality so I was interested in<br>looking at whether or not there was any<br>association between marriage and the<br>development of mental<br>disorders<br>now I don't know why you all laugh but<br>anyway<br>um I just need to make a brief comment<br>about methodology because you know some<br>of you who are researchers will be<br>perhaps wondering so I mean the best way<br>of looking at the kind of SE sequence of<br>events like for example the effect of<br>marriage on subsequent mental disorders<br>the best way of doing that is to use<br>prospective data where you follow people<br>over time and that's not the kind of<br>data we have here we have<br>cross-sectional surveys so it's<br>cross-sectional data however uh we have<br>collected information on the timing of<br>the key events that we want to look at<br>the sequencing of so we have information<br>on the age of marriage on the age of<br>first onset of mental disorders on the<br>age of if people uh got divorced when<br>that was the age of widowhood and so on<br>now our data are not as good as<br>prospective data because we're relying<br>on people's recall so there's lots of<br>opportunity uh for error and for bias<br>however we have a very large data set<br>and that gives us some advantages you<br>know we're now up to about 150,000<br>participants in the world mental health<br>surveys uh probably 50 to 100<br>participants uh sorry 50 to 100,000<br>participants for some of these earlier<br>papers so what that means is that we're<br>able to tackle some research questions<br>that that other studies prospective<br>studies with their smaller samples<br>haven't been able to tackle and the<br>relationship between marriage and mental<br>health is a case in point because when<br>you are thinking about what the effect<br>of marriage might be there are sort of<br>two possible comparisons you can make<br>you can compare people who are currently<br>married with people who are never<br>married or you can compare people who<br>are currently married with people whose<br>marriages have ended in divorce or by<br>widowhood and it's only really the<br>latter kind of study that had been done<br>that compar comparison of marriage with<br>divorce and really they'd only looked at<br>depression as an outcome they hadn't<br>really looked at the other 15 or 16<br>mental disorders that we're interested<br>in so with the world Mental Health Data<br>we were able to look at the relationship<br>between marriage and mental disorders in<br>a much more kind of comprehensive way so<br>just to very Briefly summarize what we<br>had what we knew already so what we knew<br>already actually is that marriage is<br>good for physical health so uh you know<br>that seems to be quite well established<br>so you know<br>husbands and wies sort of encourage each<br>other in positive Health behaviors or<br>nag each other or you know whatever it<br>is it seems to be working anyway uh in<br>promoting physical health but for mental<br>health though the situation was less<br>clear there were quite a few studies<br>that suggested that marriage was good<br>for men's mental health but for women uh<br>the data were much more conflicting in<br>fact there were some studies that<br>suggested that marriage uh had the<br>opposite effect and was uh inclined to<br>increase the risk of depression<br>so what we found and I'm just<br>summarizing an awful lot of analysis<br>here we found that being married<br>compared to people uh who either were<br>never married or who were once married<br>and then divorced separated or Widow we<br>found that being married was associated<br>with reduced risk of first onset of<br>nearly all mental disorders for both men<br>and women so a generally protective<br>effect of marriage uh for mental<br>health however for depression and for<br>panic disorder we found that this risk<br>reduction only occurred in<br>men there was just a kind of neutral<br>effect for women so it wasn't the<br>marriage increased risk for for of<br>depression for women or decreased it it<br>was just kind of neutral what was<br>interesting though is that when we broke<br>because this is all countries combined<br>when we broke the countries up into two<br>groups into developing countries and<br>into developed countries we found that<br>if we just looked at developed countries<br>like you know New Zealand and the United<br>States that actually marriage was<br>associated with reduced risk of<br>depression for women as well as men<br>wasn't as strong an effect for women but<br>it was there so reduced risk for women<br>but in the developing countries we found<br>the opposite so there marriage was<br>actually associated with increased risk<br>of depression for women and reduced risk<br>of depression for men again an<br>interesting finding I think you know<br>really quite consistent with what we<br>were seeing uh in the gender role<br>equality paper and collectively I think<br>that you know these findings from these<br>papers are a really important reminder<br>in this day and age where biological<br>hypotheses are pushed so strongly an<br>important reminder that that social<br>factors and relationships amongst those<br>social factors can be critically<br>important in shaping the likelihood of<br>developing mental disorders for men and<br>for<br>women okay I'm going to move now and uh<br>talk about move on and talk about my<br>kind of second area of interest and just<br>preface this by a few remarks about the<br>impact of mental disorders so we've done<br>uh lots of research other people have<br>too looking at the shortterm impact of<br>Nal disorders and the way we look at<br>this is to assess the the impact that<br>mental disorders have on people's uh<br>ability to function in their everyday<br>lives so it's called functional<br>impairment and what we've found uh in<br>both the New Zealand data and has been<br>found in many other studies that<br>actually the associative functional imp<br>of mental disorders is substantially<br>greater than the functional impairment<br>people experience when they have chronic<br>physical conditions like diabetes or<br>heart<br>disease it's the long-term impact that<br>I've been interested in looking at<br>though uh and again we've done quite a<br>lot of research on this in the world<br>mental health surveys it's been<br>summarized in the book that you see<br>there the reason that mental disorders<br>have such great long-term impact is<br>because when of when they occur uh in<br>the lifespan so these are these are<br>early onset disorders so the median age<br>if you just consider all disorders sort<br>of average across all mental disorders<br>the median age of onset is 18 it's a<br>little bit older uh for some of the<br>disorders so for depression one or two<br>of the anxiety disorders is more the<br>median age of onset is more uh into the<br>20s but for some of the anxiety<br>disorders is actually in<br>childhood so with that early onset comes<br>the capacity for severe and persistent<br>disord ERS to have a really profound<br>influence on the the total kind of Life<br>trajectory if you like uh of the people<br>experiencing those disorders so mental<br>disorders can influence the capacity to<br>get into relationships or to maintain<br>relationships uh people's ability to um<br>achieve their educational outcomes or to<br>you know to take up educational<br>opportunities to get into particular<br>jobs the careers that they purum to work<br>at<br>all um and so have a flow on effect of<br>course into financial and economic<br>status so really quite a profound<br>long-term<br>effect what I was particularly<br>interested in looking at though is<br>whether there might be another long-term<br>effect that was less well understood and<br>that is whether mental disorders might<br>actually increase the risk of developing<br>chronic physical conditions later in<br>life now I was funded by the HRC uh in<br>this project so prior to starting this<br>project was was about five years ago<br>what we knew at that time we definitely<br>knew that psychotic disorders like<br>schizophrenia were associated with poor<br>physical health outcomes I mean part of<br>that is because of the medic the antis<br>psychotic medication that they have to<br>take but but it's not just that so that<br>was very clear what was also clear is<br>that there was a specific link between<br>depression and heart disease because<br>there had been quite a few prospective<br>studies on heart disease trying to work<br>out what the risk factors for heart<br>disease were and they they usually<br>included measures of depression symptoms<br>not usually disorder but certainly<br>symptoms and they kept finding an<br>association between elevated depression<br>symptoms and the likelihood of actually<br>getting heart disease or having a heart<br>attack or dying from heart<br>disease so there was actually intense<br>interest in this particular association<br>between depression and heart disease I<br>mean researchers really once this link<br>was discovered they just kind of fell on<br>it and there have just been hundreds of<br>studies looking at this what the kind of<br>mechanisms might be linking depression<br>uh and heart disease<br>now this bothered me because I felt that<br>the broader epidemiological picture<br>hadn't been looked at so we didn't<br>really know for example whether<br>depression might be associated with a<br>much wider range of chronic physical<br>conditions other than heart disease and<br>we also didn't know whether other mental<br>disorders besides depression might be<br>related to heart disease and many other<br>chronic physical conditions and it<br>struck me that you know if that was true<br>if there was this much broader Network<br>that that really had quite important<br>public health and clinical implications<br>and might mean that you know all of the<br>research dollars being thrown into this<br>particular link between depression and<br>heart disease might be a bit<br>premature so uh just to reiterate so no<br>General populations means in other words<br>um there had been one or two clinical<br>studies but certainly no general<br>population study of weather this wide<br>range of meal disorders might be linked<br>with a wide range of chronic physical<br>conditions so that's what we set out to<br>look at we uh looked at associations<br>between 16 mental disorders uh and the<br>subsequent diagnosis of these 11 chronic<br>physical conditions and I mean one of<br>the things that sorry one of the things<br>I didn't make clear actually when I was<br>talking about the methodology is that<br>because we have the information on the<br>timing of these events what it means is<br>that we can do statistical analysis the<br>kind same kinds of statistical analysis<br>that you would undertake with<br>prospective data to look at uh the<br>sequencing of events and that that<br>allowed Us in this case to do analyses<br>looking at whether having a prior mental<br>disorder to increase your risk of<br>subsequent diagnosis of one of these<br>chronic physical conditions because I<br>mean these are mental health surveys uh<br>that we have but we did include some<br>information we collected some<br>information from participants uh in<br>whether or not they had ever been<br>diagnosed by a physician with one of<br>these chronic physical conditions and<br>when what what year that was uh if they<br>had been so diagnosed so that enabled us<br>to do these kind of sequential analyses<br>so what we found is that uh as kind of<br>expected or as I anticipated was that in<br>fact a really wide range of mental<br>disorders were associated with increased<br>risk of subsequent diagnosis of a very<br>wide range of physical conditions so<br>Depression was not just associated with<br>heart disease it was associated with all<br>11 of The Chronic physical conditions<br>that we were looking at and in fact the<br>depression heart disease link was<br>actually the weakest uh one of the<br>weakest of the ones that we saw although<br>it was statistically<br>significant we also found that the more<br>mental disorders somebody experiences<br>over the life course the more especially<br>the more types of different mental<br>disorders the greater the risk of sub<br>subsequent physical ill health um and I<br>mean we saw a kind of dose response<br>relationship there in terms of the<br>number of disorders people experienced<br>uh and the likelihood of being diagnosed<br>with a chronic physical condition later<br>on we also found that the earlier the<br>onset of mental disorder the greater the<br>risk of being diagnosed with a a<br>physical condition later so these these<br>last two the the number of disorders the<br>earlyer the onset these are kind of<br>markers of the severity of<br>Psychopathology uh so it's not<br>surprising that these are uh linked with<br>um greater risk of mental dis of<br>physical conditions<br>later now just before I go on to talk<br>about the implications just very briefly<br>um briefly because you know we don't<br>really have the data to show this but<br>some people will be wondering how is it<br>that mental disorders can increase the<br>risk of chronic physical conditions so<br>um really two main Pathways the the<br>first of this is a a behavioral pathway<br>because we know that people with mental<br>disorders tend to have poorer health<br>related Behavior we actually had<br>information on smoking and we controlled<br>for smoking in our analyses so it's not<br>just that but but these other behaviors<br>May well be involved there are many<br>biological Pathways too that have been<br>suggested so we also know that people<br>with mental disorders have higher stress<br>hormones because having a mental<br>disorder is kind of like experiencing<br>chronic stress so higher stress hormones<br>higher levels of inflammation uh and<br>oxidative stress uh and you know these<br>these things underpin chronic phys uh<br>physical conditions quite a wide range<br>of conditions and there are also<br>Healthcare Pathways that I'm going to<br>talk about a little bit more uh in just<br>a minute but essentially there can be<br>differences in the way people with and<br>without mental disorders are treated uh<br>so the implications from uh our study I<br>think uh are that we need early<br>detection and treatment of mental<br>disorders and I mean if we if we do<br>manage to achieve that if we have<br>earlier detection uh and better<br>treatment of mental disorders and we've<br>got a real opportunity for influencing<br>the primary prevention of chronic<br>physical conditions now I mean many of<br>us have been lobbying for the early<br>detection and treatment of mental<br>disorders for a wide range of reasons<br>for all the obvious reasons like the<br>suffering that they cause and the the<br>elevation of suicide risk but here is<br>another reason uh in terms of the<br>possibility uh of preventing later<br>chronic physical conditions and this is<br>a reason that I'm hoping that policy<br>makers will sit up and take notice of<br>because actually it's the chronic<br>physical conditions that really uh are<br>the costly thing in terms of the Health<br>Care<br>system treatment of mental disorder I<br>think has to be accompanied by<br>assessment of Health behaviors uh and of<br>biomarkers the biomarkers for The<br>Chronic physical conditions like blood<br>pressure and high cholesterol and so on<br>now that does not systematically happen<br>you might think that it would happen but<br>actually it's it's kind of almost like<br>the opposite once people get a diagnosis<br>of a mental disorder uh they're actually<br>less likely to be evaluated in terms of<br>health behaviors uh and these um uh<br>Health biomarkers perhaps I mean I don't<br>mean to imply that GPS are being<br>neglectful but I think it's kind of like<br>you know once<br>people have been diagnosed with<br>something like depression I think GPS<br>often think well you know that's really<br>the priority and I I don't want to<br>bother them now by talking about you<br>know their smoking or their diet and so<br>on and so I understand how that's<br>happening but I think unfortunately you<br>know we're were kind of failing patience<br>there another implication is that we<br>actually need to be doing this parallel<br>focus on the physical health of people<br>with mental health problems even in<br>young people with mental disorders and<br>this is just not happening for sort of<br>understandable reasons because I think<br>people tend to think well you know young<br>people are in the prime of their lives<br>physically and you know relatively<br>speaking um that's true but what we also<br>know from a lot of research now is<br>actually the the beginnings or the<br>pathogenesis of chronic physical<br>conditions actually are evident very<br>early in life so you know autopsy<br>studies uh have shown us that<br>artherosclerosis which underpins<br>coronary heart disease is evident there<br>uh even in late childhood uh and in the<br>tens<br>and<br>finally you know the implication of of<br>my study is that we need to be assessing<br>physical health for all mental disorders<br>not just psychotic disorders and again<br>this just isn't happening so to the<br>extent that there is a parallel focus on<br>the physical health of people with<br>mental disorders this is presently just<br>confined to people with schizophrenia<br>and very occasionally people with<br>bipolar disorder it's certainly not<br>happening uh for people with all of<br>those other disorders which are much<br>more<br>prevalent uh and we've published about<br>15 papers from this project so there's<br>much more detail than I've been able to<br>present to you here but I was very<br>pleased at the that the final sort of<br>overview paper which summarizes these<br>findings and and in which I draw out<br>these implications uh was accepted for<br>publication just last week by a very<br>good Journal jam psychiatr and that<br>gives me hope that maybe uh somebody at<br>okay I'm just I'm moving on to finish my<br>talk but I just wanted to make some<br>brief acknowledgements and to<br>acknowledge the people who have really<br>kind of helped me in my career uh and<br>the first of these is ameritus Professor<br>Elizabeth Welles who was the bio<br>statistician for the New Zealand mental<br>health survey uh and you know we were<br>enormously fortunate in New Zealand to<br>have somebody of Elizabeth's expertise<br>and caliber uh I don't know that we<br>could have done that survey without her<br>and Mike Von K uh who was really My<br>Mentor in the early my early years of of<br>looking at mental physical co-morbidity<br>uh prior to the HRC Grant uh and has<br>been hugely<br>helpful and Professor Ron Kesler who is<br>you know really the brilliant mind and<br>the driving force behind the world<br>mental health surveys I mean I think Ron<br>is your typical kind of overworked<br>overburdened Harvard academic but he has<br>nonetheless found the time to provide me<br>with a great deal of statistical help<br>and input and critical feedback on my<br>work and I'm uh hugely grateful for that<br>I also want to acknowledge Carmen Lim<br>who is in the audience here kmen uh is<br>my bio statistician has been working<br>with me on the the mentop physical Grant<br>and still works with me now and you know<br>it's thanks to K's hard work and<br>churning out Table after table uh that<br>is enabled me to continue to be<br>productive and finally last but not<br>least I wanted to uh acknowledge the<br>unflagging support both uh practical and<br>emotional of my partner Alan Williams<br>Alan and I met uh 26 years ago when I<br>returned to University to study<br>psychology uh and he was there studying<br>mathematics and<br>education and I selected this photo<br>because I thought it kind of exemplified<br>what I was telling you before about<br>marriage having a beneficial effect of<br>both physical health because here we are<br>hiking and mental health CU we're both<br>smiling uh thank you very much for your<br>attention<br>Kate don't don't run away please um i'<br>I'd like to keep this very brief but um<br>I'm here just to say a couple of words<br>um firstly thank you for an outstanding<br>presentation um the um the the slides<br>that you're showing here seem uh you<br>boiled down some incredibly comp complex<br>topics into um a series of bullet points<br>and I think that's that's a remarkable<br>achievement and really the complexity of<br>these bidirectional relationships<br>between mental and uh physical disorders<br>are are extraordinary in their<br>complexity and I think um it's not just<br>looking at a few say genetic or or<br>environmental effects that there are<br>social roles that there are<br>psychological elements that may drive<br>these so and I think the ability to to<br>explore data sets and come up with these<br>novel and very important findings is is<br>incredibly important um it's been<br>wonderful having you as a colleague um I<br>think you've uh brought a a new<br>intellectual rigor to the department I<br>think you've had a major effect on on uh<br>teaching in the department and and I<br>think you've influenced a lot of people<br>with your um with your research<br>abilities and your and your own personal<br>qualities so um thank you very much<br>congratulations professor and we look<br>forward to Great research achievements<br>in the future thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
