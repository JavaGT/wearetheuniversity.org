Further research this year is expected to lead to benefits for people who need treatments for eye conditions such as keratoconus and eventually for myopia.  The research into these new treatment is expected to reduce the chronic waiting list for donor corneas in New Zealand, including for those with other eye conditions awaiting corneal transplant.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>our research group aimed to target their<br>disease keratoconus keratoconus the<br>front of the eye the cornea loses its<br>shape it loses the stroma the cellular<br>matrix which composes the cornea and<br>because of that it doesn't focus light<br>onto the back of the eye properly we<br>wanted to turn the cells which form the<br>cornea into a more developmental state<br>so that they would reform a newer cornea<br>in a better shape and be able to refocus<br>that that light back onto the eye and<br>therefore the patient would see better<br>the eyedrop contains a growth factor and<br>a steroid at very very low level so sub<br>toxic to the eye and sub toxic to the<br>cells that compose the eye some very we<br>think very safe and what those eyedrops<br>do is that they act on the cells and<br>they convinced the cells that they are<br>back at at much earlier stage in<br>development so in the embryonic tissue<br>when you're in the embryo the eye forms<br>from the neural crest so we convince the<br>cells they're back at an earlier stage<br>and because they're in earlier stage<br>they Express the molecules which are<br>composed in after the cornea in the<br>embryo but then are replaced in human<br>adult tissue we are targeting initially<br>adults so our therapeutic will be<br>conducted on clinical trials eventually<br>once within the sheep trials on adult<br>character chronic patients and if that's<br>successful within target sub cert<br>patients who are not yet approaching<br>surgical procedures and therefore we can<br>hopefully resolve the keratoconus at a<br>much younger age we first again started<br>looking at the tissue and how we could<br>turn it back in developmental stages and<br>we aimed first to turn it back into<br>nerve cells so we gave it to the cells a<br>neurogenic factor and in fact they<br>started looking and acting more like<br>nerve cells could we then wanted to see<br>if we could turn those cells into other<br>cell types which also developed from the<br>new<br>crest and one of those cell types is<br>cartilage so the forms they the tissue<br>in your joints and we aimed of<br>expressing type two collagen which is<br>uniquely collagen two also is expressed<br>in the cornea in the embryo and is<br>replaced later by collagen one in the<br>adults in the adult stage cornea so we<br>were in fact turning back the<br>developmental clock which enabled us to<br>reform a much more an earlier stage<br>cornea the therapeutic works on human<br>tissue in a dish we then process that<br>into an animal model so it worked on<br>live rodent models we need to show that<br>it works on a much larger animal model<br>and that we can reshape the cornea and<br>stabilize it for a long period of time<br>so that we can help these patients for<br>with a much long-term procedure so the<br>work we're doing now moving is moving<br>into a sheep model so we will reshape<br>the sheep cornea add our therapeutic<br>drop and then monitor how the shape of<br>that corner corner is maintained up to<br>six months time so these are long-term<br>experiments once we finish those<br>experiments then we can start looking at<br>doing human clinical trials so then<br>we'll be looking at our end stage<br>keratoconus patients and whether we can<br>then trial the drops in our human<br>patients in a safe and efficacious<br>manner the sheep results will continue<br>throughout this year the analysis of<br>those sheep of the sheep experimental<br>results will be concluded in early 2017<br>and then by the time we will then need<br>to go for regulatory controls over our<br>clinical trials so we could be looking<br>at doing human clinical trials late 2017<br>if all progresses work<br>our research is always aimed to help<br>patients with eye problems in the early<br>stages of this research we were looking<br>at ways of restoring nerve tissue to<br>corneal graft patients so when a patient<br>has a choreograph that tissue is excised<br>and those nerves are cut that supply the<br>iron and as you can imagine the eye is<br>usually a very sensitive tissue and once<br>you desensitize it then it's prone to<br>accidents and trauma so we were actually<br>looking at ways of restoring the nerve<br>tissue we managed to in some ways<br>restore that nerve tissue and then we<br>started thinking about other<br>developmental tissues which could also<br>be restored in the eye and we happen to<br>think about collagen types and if we<br>could we then started to think about<br>whether we could reshape the cornea<br>firstly for keratoconus and now that we<br>have established the initial experiments<br>aimed at character CONUS we're now<br>starting to look at designing or<br>treatment for myopic patients who may be<br>treated short and treating short<br>sightedness in the long run if<br>everything progresses as smoothly as we<br>would like it to if the cheap trials are<br>are successful we move into clinical<br>trials then proof in the clinical trials<br>of low top very low toxicity and very<br>high efficacy would then be proof of<br>principle we believe for the Food and<br>Drug Administration towards approving<br>the treatment for non disease patients<br>and that would open up the whole gamut<br>of myopic patients short-sighted<br>patients worldwide which is over a<br>billion people who suffer from short<br>sightedness ultimately what we would aim<br>to develop the throat therapeutic for is<br>treating children who are showing the<br>first signs of developing myopia<br>treating them as such a young age that<br>had never even developed<br>shortsightedness that we stopped it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
