law<br>school to welcome you to the 2016 law<br>student awards this evening we will<br>celebrate our best and brightest our<br>students who have excelled over the last<br>12 months we will recognize our student<br>leaders will congratulate the students<br>of one our competitions have represented<br>the Auckland law school nationally and<br>internationally will mark the<br>achievements of our students who've won<br>prizes and scholarships what they all<br>have in common is hard work commitment<br>perseverance interest and enthusiasm for<br>the law I'd like to welcome here tonight<br>all the students who are receiving<br>Awards you have done well and the<br>members of the faculty of law here<br>tonight join me in congratulating you<br>I'd like to welcome your family members<br>and close friends who are able to be<br>here this evening because I'm sure all<br>of our students receiving awards will be<br>well aware that they couldn't have<br>achieved their success without your<br>support your encouragement and your love<br>you can be very proud of all they've<br>achieved and knowing that you've helped<br>make their success possible i'd like to<br>welcome many of the individuals and<br>organizations and representatives of<br>firms who have donated prizes and<br>scholarships for our best students who<br>have supported our student societies and<br>the events and competitions they<br>organized and who have given financial<br>assistance to the law school and what we<br>are trying to do we are immensely<br>grateful the prizes and scholarships<br>were awarding this evening the donations<br>you provide mean a lot to our students<br>they recognize their hard work the hours<br>spent in libraries staying up late<br>seeking to master particular courses<br>cases legal principles and areas of the<br>law this is a very successful law school<br>nationally and internationally we are<br>very proud of our students and we are<br>very grateful for the support many of<br>you here tonight have given i would like<br>to welcome them<br>of the legal profession and the<br>Judiciary you who are here tonight we<br>have judges who have satin or a<br>currently sitting in the district court<br>the High Court the Court of Appeal and<br>the Supreme Court and I thank you for<br>being able to attend we're very grateful<br>for the support provided to us not only<br>in financial terms but also by helping<br>and mentoring students adjudicating<br>moots and competitions and supporting<br>students and faculty activities the<br>format of tonight's award ceremony is<br>relatively simple in that the awards<br>will be presented in the groups that are<br>set out in the program so before each<br>group I will ask the students who are in<br>that particular group to come forward to<br>the left of the stage so to this<br>particular side of the stage and to line<br>up in the order in the program that will<br>vary make sure hopefully you get the<br>certificate with your name on it and<br>don't get a high reward than you're<br>entitled to when I call your name if you<br>come up the steps just here and I<br>suppose that's the cue when I have<br>finished calling the name that's the<br>queue where people can applaud and<br>congratulate the student but if you come<br>up shake my hand at that point and then<br>go behind me to where the deputy dean<br>and professor susan Watson I will<br>present you with your certificate and<br>then once you've received the<br>certificate if you could go to the to<br>this side of the stage it'll be from<br>where you're looking at the right hand<br>side of the stage and if you could wait<br>until we've got all the members of that<br>particular group together because what<br>we will then do is a group photograph of<br>everyone in that group so that will give<br>the audience a very slight intermission<br>of half a minute or free cause a minute<br>while everyone's lined up for the group<br>photograph that's where you can talk to<br>your neighbors eat drink be merry but<br>not too much so because they will<br>immediately go on to the very next award<br>at that particular point but again<br>probably when we photograph the group<br>that may be another occasion to<br>congratulate them all as a group for<br>what they've achieved so we'd ask at<br>this point if those who are in the<br>program as student leaders could come<br>forward in a symbol on the left-hand<br>side of the stage but it's really what<br>we want to do and with<br>part of the program is to think and<br>congratulate those who put a lot of work<br>into our student societies and when I<br>read out the names au LSS the Auckland<br>University law student society is one of<br>the most active and successful law<br>student societies in the country that<br>organizes a wide range of competitions<br>seminars workshops sports drink social<br>events Torah coterie provides a<br>community and support for our Maori law<br>students just one example of the work<br>they do is organising an annual hire<br>anger to schools to promote are coming<br>to law school thinking of going to<br>university and I know that they inform<br>and enthuse large numbers of school<br>pupils many of whom end up at Auckland<br>University as a result pulsar is our<br>Pacific island Law Students Association<br>and they provide community and support<br>for our Pacific law students just<br>recently they put on a cultural day for<br>all law students and it was wonderful to<br>see other dancing the food over 300<br>students I'm coming from around the law<br>school to participate on that occasion<br>rainbow law is the group that provides<br>community and support for our lesbian<br>gay bisexual and transgender students<br>last year rainbow law hosted Justice<br>Michael Kirby one of Australia's best<br>snow and judges who came and spoke about<br>marriage equality the equal justice<br>project is an endeavor that involves<br>over the years many hundreds of our<br>students who take part in providing free<br>legal assistance to individuals to<br>organisations who might not be able to<br>afford the cost of lawyers and they do<br>so in partnership with community groups<br>Community Law Center's and members of<br>the legal profession the a ulr is the<br>Auckland University Law Review and this<br>is uniquely in New Zealand an entirely<br>student-run publication and it means<br>that for the editors and will only be<br>congratulating the editors in chief<br>today and but there's a whole array of<br>editors who spend a lot of time reading<br>reviewing editing and publishing what is<br>an extremely high quality journal the<br>Law Review not to be compared<br>it not to be confused with the Auckland<br>University Law Review is where a large<br>number of students take to the stage to<br>sing dance satire and Lampoon various<br>aspects of the law and society you can<br>see some of their past endeavors on<br>YouTube and as interested to see that<br>one of their our video clips from the<br>2014 production has now received over 5<br>million views which are possibly more<br>than most academic articles in terms of<br>impact and last but not least we're<br>going to congratulate or thank the<br>president of our Moon Society this is a<br>new society only established in 2013 but<br>already it's achieved an enormous amount<br>to encourage and promote mouton at all<br>levels this year 750 of our students<br>have joined the moutain Society it<br>helped establish a new meeting<br>competition for food and fourth

congratulations let me<br>go down immature really well done<br>congratulations alex king you want to<br>congratulations with you a gun Kiara<br>super shed in my words woof really well<br>congratulations just like our prize<br>winners I think again the men have some<br>catching up to do in terms of scholastic<br>excellence we're honored to have as our<br>guest speaker this evening justice Helen<br>Winkelmann a judge of the Court of<br>Appeal justice when Kilburn first and<br>foremost is an alumna of this law school<br>but she's had a very distinguished<br>career in the law she was a lawyer a<br>partner of Philips Fox a barrister soul<br>was made a High Court judge in 2004 and<br>became the chief High Court judge in<br>2010 before taking up her current<br>position on the Court of Appeal last<br>year just as when Kelman as I think a<br>really great example to all of the<br>students in our law school particularly<br>to the woman law students not that they<br>perhaps need encouragement and from what<br>we've just seen in the law school<br>because she has been a trailblazer in<br>the law as chief High Court judge the<br>work that she undertook to improve case<br>management to improve the delivery of<br>judgments in good time for litigants was<br>incredibly noticeable the reforms and<br>the efficiency that was brought to the<br>work of the High Court and the meaning<br>that that ahead before parties to the<br>court I also would suggest to the<br>students that you have a look at<br>so just to single out as well as one<br>example of the work and the career of<br>Justice winkleman I'd suggest you have a<br>look if you haven't already at a lecture<br>on access and justice in 2014 but so was<br>struck that in that lecture she talks<br>about the fact that for centuries judges<br>and lawyers have worked together to<br>ensure that all can enjoy the benefit of<br>the protection of the law including<br>those who are vulnerable by reason of<br>limited means limited education their<br>minority status or gender and in that<br>lecture she talked about the problems<br>people today head gaining access to the<br>law the problems of the cost of lawyers<br>the problems of the cost of court fees<br>and noted that unless we have proper<br>access to law we will live in a society<br>where the string will by any means<br>always went out against the week she<br>talked about the problems when you ended<br>up with unrepresented litigants who<br>couldn't afford to bring their to have<br>their own lawyers who naturally would<br>have difficulty in preparing adequately<br>who had none of the knowledge of the law<br>how a case should be pleaded or what<br>evidence was relevant she said the court<br>system is for many a foreign land and<br>the notion of bringing proceedings<br>without legal representation can be<br>compared to the fearful prospect of<br>being stranded in a foreign land and<br>able to speak the language and without<br>the money needed to find your way home<br>and if we have a court system where many<br>many many ordinary people could not<br>contemplate going to court because of<br>the cost of doing so we have a court<br>system that as vulnerable as fragile and<br>where the legal profession and the<br>Judiciary need to look at what the court<br>system should represent and the people<br>that could protect so I was very proud<br>to read one of our alumni talking about<br>one of the major issues in the law<br>expressing it so eloquently as she does<br>in all her judgments but who overall has<br>a keen sense of justice and justice for<br>all sectors of the community would you<br>thank you Andrew thank you for inviting<br>me to speak tonight as a judge I spend a<br>lot of time listening to other people<br>speak so I know about the importance of<br>keeping it short this seems to me to<br>particularly apply tonight as I'm aware<br>that I stand between so some of you and<br>your prizes in any case you can relax<br>about how long I'm going to take because<br>the run sheet was sent to me in<br>preparation for this event and believe<br>me nothing has been left to chance it<br>started at 8am this morning and<br>according to the run sheet I'm allowed<br>12 minutes and no more so I better get<br>underway first of all wow these people<br>who came up on stage today some bright<br>talents I was pleased to see my judges<br>clerk Jack Davies repeatedly appeared<br>that's that's standing you in good stead<br>Jack I want to congratulate you all on<br>the achievements that we're here to<br>recognize and to celebrate some of you<br>will have achieved through your natural<br>brilliance but most of you like me need<br>to put in some pretty hard work to shine<br>out and you clearly have done that I<br>also say well done to your families as<br>Andrew mentioned you didn't get here on<br>your own and I know that families<br>provide support in any way they can and<br>it must have been quite some support<br>because you've achieved at a very high<br>level I've decided to select one theme<br>for this evening and to stick to it and<br>some of it will revisit a little bit of<br>what Andrew said but I hope not a<br>monotonous way about access to justice<br>I'm going to address you as future<br>leaders of the profession because that<br>is what you truly are and I'm aware<br>that's present tonight are also members<br>of the profession senior members the<br>profession so there might be a few<br>messages that they can listen to on the<br>way so your future leaders of the<br>profession well maybe a few of you will<br>go off and become CEOs of tech companies<br>they pay better than the law these days<br>or lead unmanned women lead missions to<br>Mars but most of you will stay in the<br>profession because it's an important<br>profession<br>about which there's a lot to love and<br>you will become its leaders I don't mean<br>to flatter you in this way in any way<br>but let's look at it as a matter of<br>probabilities if you have the brains and<br>the application to be at the front of<br>your cohort at this stage I think the<br>same will hold true with the rest of<br>your time in the law the laws an<br>exciting career no matter what path you<br>follow and my experience it gives you<br>plenty of opportunities to stretch your<br>mind and to test your moral fiber to<br>find out who you really are and I am<br>very interested to know who you are what<br>will interest you in the law do you<br>understand the golden threads that run<br>through the law like fairness the<br>presumption of innocence the protection<br>of all from the abuse of power will you<br>be motivated by achieving just outcomes<br>or will you be happy to engage in a<br>process so long as you can charge for it<br>do you have courage do you a human or<br>again only if it's chargeable and short<br>are you doing this to just earn a living<br>or also because you understand the power<br>and frankly what I think of as the<br>beauty of the law and want to contribute<br>something to our society the thing about<br>the practice of the law is that you'll<br>be asking yourself these things and<br>they're not do too distant future when<br>you're confronted with sometimes<br>terrible reality of client demands and<br>charge will our targets for my part I'd<br>like to know that these things about our<br>future leaders because after sitting as<br>a judge for 12 years in the high court<br>and now in the court of appeal I've seen<br>the importance of a profession made up<br>of people of moral and intellectual<br>integrity who wish to use these skills<br>and knowledge to contribute something to<br>society who you are is important because<br>you are now a member of the profession<br>which plays at the most critical role in<br>our democracy through upholding the rule<br>of law and the administration of justice<br>and for those non lawyers in the room I<br>say hello you are now members of the<br>club by association don't worry it's a<br>good club but I also offer a quick<br>explanation of the rule of law which is<br>the thing that andrew is too<br>but before the notion that everyone in<br>our society exists under and is equal<br>before the law the powerful and the week<br>the rich and the poor all abound by an<br>equal before the law and the rule of law<br>is really the bedrock on which our new<br>zealand society is built and it's a<br>ground grand sounding principle but I<br>recommend it to you something that<br>should resound throughout your career it<br>isn't just something for the top end of<br>town for the qcs taking the glamorous<br>cases to the supreme court lawyers<br>uphold the Royal rule of law by enabling<br>access to justice the person the local<br>conveyancing practice is just as<br>important here as the partner and the<br>Shortland Street law firm the work of<br>the family lawyer helps people order and<br>document their affairs and ways that<br>create legally enforceable rights and<br>obligations and lawyers practicing and<br>the various tribunals and courts are<br>also important whether they work at<br>legal aid rates or can premium build all<br>practicing lawyers enable people to<br>enforce their legal rights and ensure<br>they obtain a protection of the law and<br>as future leaders of present profession<br>you have a particular role here because<br>you will set the standards for the<br>profession through the quality of your<br>conduct the advice you give your clients<br>and the arguments you make in court I<br>hope that as Future Leaders you will<br>also play your part and developing in<br>the indigenous law of New Zealand what<br>justice Joe Williams calls Lex Arturo<br>our own law for this time and place our<br>nation the legendary fish that Maui<br>pulled up from the ocean already swims<br>and its own ocean waters it always has<br>done its what it's always swam in its<br>own legal waters but that reality was<br>brought home to my generation by the<br>cutting of ties from England and by the<br>development of the law in connection<br>with the Treaty of Waitangi I know with<br>confidence that leaks are Terra will<br>continue to develop and content content<br>and richness and I should say something<br>about that expression Alixe ayer te<br>adoro because it's one of the principles<br>that will be drummed into law students<br>that they shouldn't use Latin but it's<br>so nice I can't resist<br>as Future Leaders I place on your<br>shoulders the mantle of conscious<br>engagement with this process the process<br>of the development of our law the<br>quality of our nation's law is directly<br>connected to the intellect and<br>imagination of those in our legal<br>profession lawyers who spot the legal<br>issue who can see with the novel<br>argument but see always those golden<br>threads that run through the law and<br>which underpin our liberal democracy<br>what other challenges do I set for you<br>as future leaders at the front of my<br>mind and I'd say at the front of the<br>professions mind is the challenge of<br>enabling access to justice the problem<br>is that most New Zealanders simply<br>cannot afford to seek legal advice if<br>they run into difficulty legal<br>difficulty of any kind they can't resort<br>afford to have resort to the courts and<br>the obstacles for those who seek access<br>to justice are many but some of them are<br>problems the legal profession needs to<br>address it is too expensive to get help<br>from a lawyer when lawyers are engaged<br>they can unnecessarily complicate<br>matters getting help from a lawyer<br>becomes not only expensive but also a<br>test of endurance so what can you do as<br>future leaders of the profession well<br>you can join the working groups at the<br>Law Society and the Bar Association of<br>set up to address access to justice<br>because both those organizations have<br>identified this as the most important<br>issue for our profession you can<br>volunteer to work at Community Law<br>Center's and when you feel brave enough<br>enough you can tell your employers that<br>you would like to do lower value work<br>work for people who cannot afford your<br>full charge out rate why would you do<br>all these things well my thought is that<br>this is work which will give you great<br>experience if you're a court lawyer will<br>give you the chance to get into court<br>more often so you're not spending<br>spending your life working on electronic<br>discovery just as importantly it will<br>meet that need that you have I'm sure<br>you have to do something that feels like<br>it matters because the work you will be<br>doing will be important to your client<br>and it might even change a life what's<br>my next challenge for you well this<br>might be just as tough as the last<br>and given what we've just seen it may<br>not surprise you the challenge is how to<br>make this profession fit for all its<br>members sometime in the next year or two<br>we will reach the moment in time when<br>more than half or practicing lawyers a<br>woman you might be surprised we haven't<br>already reached that point when you saw<br>it before but you've got to think that<br>there are practicing lawyers who are<br>practicing well into their 70s but even<br>so we're about to reach the point in<br>time when more than half of practicing<br>lawyers a woman nevertheless women<br>remain under represented amongst law<br>firm partners at the senior bar and in<br>the higher judiciary this is a problem<br>for our profession as it means that we<br>are not bringing through to leadership<br>roles some of our best and brightest I<br>should say that this is not the result<br>of any deliberate keeping out of women<br>far from it successive Attorney<br>General's have been committed to<br>appointing able senior woman to the<br>district court and higher court benches<br>but the problems that they face is that<br>retaining one the law until they have<br>sufficient experience for appointment is<br>just very difficult law firms and the<br>provision of legal services are<br>organized in a way at the moment which<br>is difficult for parents of young<br>children to manage and I think this is<br>why we are seeing so many very able<br>lures moving into into in-house legal<br>positions and all of these problems are<br>really connected but I could speak for<br>probably two hours on how they relate<br>but I'm going to suggest a radical<br>prescription which is is that law firms<br>should be making people up to<br>partnership at a younger age I was made<br>a partner in a law firm in my 20s that<br>was not because I was a wonder child it<br>was because the sensible male partners<br>knew that if they wanted to retain<br>talent they had to bring that talent<br>through to partnership today things are<br>different the present business model<br>sets partnership and a law firm as the<br>goal for your mid to late thirties the<br>time when people plan to have children<br>is now also the time when they should be<br>pressing for partnership I speak from<br>experience when I say it's much easier<br>to manage being a working parent when<br>you're a partner with the team<br>and have the financial resources that<br>partnership usually brings and my other<br>radical prescription said to call it a<br>radical prescription in the year 2016 as<br>more equal sharing of child caring<br>responsibilities between parents so this<br>isn't a woman's problem anymore so what<br>can you do well if you're a woman<br>working a law firm start to have the<br>conversations about your career<br>aspirations believe me law firms want to<br>bring the able through to partnership<br>but start to contribute to the<br>discussions about how the law can<br>accommodate your aspirations don't just<br>sit back and wait for someone else to<br>make it work for you you should fight to<br>make it work this is a career worth<br>fighting for now I could go on and must<br>further challenges you will face as<br>future leaders of the profession the<br>rise of online delivery of legal<br>services or the existential threat to<br>all professions that the rise of<br>artificial intelligence is but on a<br>happy occasion such as tonight I will<br>use the excuse that I must be at about<br>12 minutes to bring this all to an end<br>but I want to end by saluting again your<br>achievements so far and express the wish<br>that you will take up the mantle of<br>leadership that I have offered you I<br>think would be greater than 30 years<br>time it was one of you in the spot<br>speaking to the new crop of future<br>thank you very much justice Winkelman<br>for your thoughtful and insightful<br>comments not only for our students here<br>as they contemplate their careers ahead<br>but also I'm sure for members of the<br>legal profession and the Judiciary would<br>the winners and recipients of the<br>undergraduate prizes and scholarships<br>please come to the side of the stage the<br>students were recognizing now we've just<br>earlier obviously recognized some<br>first-year students who won the new<br>entrant prizes and scholarships these<br>are the prizes given in the LLB degree<br>for students in second year and above<br>because after first year our students<br>moved to the compulsory law subjects the<br>major areas of law with lots of<br>conceptual thinking to contract torts<br>public crimes land equity and then they<br>go on to elective courses and the<br>Auckland law school is a choice for<br>around 50 elective courses so an<br>incredibly large number of elective<br>choices are the largest range of any law<br>school in this country we have as you<br>will see I'm quite a lot of scholarships<br>and subject prizes but you will be able<br>to count that we have far less than 50<br>so if there's anyone in the audience<br>some feeling they don't know what to do<br>with all of their money I would suggest<br>that certainly see me afterwards and<br>we're very happy to establish new<br>subject prizes or scholarships we do<br>have several new prizes this year and<br>I'd like to thank the individuals the<br>organizations who have donated them I<br>know that among the audience we have the<br>wife of

to say it's a very<br>vigorous program we get a large number<br>of overseas scholars who come and teach<br>on-air LLM program as well as people<br>from within the faculty and we get<br>equally a large number of international<br>students as well as students who are<br>studying and in the profession are the<br>first awards and these are for the best<br>applicants are for the LLM program so<br>very

of law deems<br>academic excellence awards are given to<br>the top 10% of the graduating class so a<br>given that we graduate 300 students a<br>year these are students who obviously<br>have done

the<br>prize that is awarded to the top law<br>undergraduate so the top law<br>undergraduate also receives a faculty of<br>law deems excellence award and a senior<br>scholar award this year's recipient is<br>also I suppose has achieved a lot in<br>other fields because he's also been a<br>member of the New Zealand men's water<br>polo team so he hasn't quite just<br>confined himself to academia he served<br>as an intern at the united nations<br>international criminal tribunal in The<br>Hague and as well as the award we're<br>congratulating him for today he also won<br>a rhodes scholarship to Oxford would you<br>come over and as you may have guessed<br>from the program that does bring<br>tonight's proceedings to an end I think<br>you'll agree with me we have a fabulous<br>group of students who have worked<br>incredibly hard who have achieved a lot<br>who'd be given a challenge by Justice<br>Winkleman to think about the values the<br>golden threads of the law and what they<br>can achieve for all people as they go<br>forward into their respective careers I<br>hope that you'll enjoy catching up with<br>people if you want to have a photograph<br>if family members want to be<br>photographed with a particular student<br>or a particular mooting team or the<br>light wants to be photographed I figured<br>be relatively easier to come forward and<br>to do
