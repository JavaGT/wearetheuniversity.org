David, a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Waikato, is creating tools that will make a musician’s job of composing, storing retrieving and performing their music much easier, and he spoke about this at his recent public lecture.<br><br>Learn more about our Inaugural Professorial Lecture Series here:  http://bit.ly/YYnOk2</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

Hydra my<br>kitten a coho hurry hurry na dara<br>atopica menengah tendra tokoto good<br>evening ladies and gentlemen it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecturer for this<br>evenings guess professor David<br>Bainbridge David received his bachelor's<br>degree in computer science from the<br>University of Edinburgh in 1991 and the<br>following two years he worked in the<br>area of computer-aided design and<br>computed a computer aided manufacturing<br>as a research engineer in London in 1993<br>David made the move to New Zealand after<br>being awarded a Commonwealth scholarship<br>to undertake a PhD at the University of<br>Canterbury there he studied the problem<br>of optical music recognition in 1996<br>David joined the department of computer<br>science at the University of Waikato<br>completed his PhD a year later he was<br>promoted successively to senior lecturer<br>associate professor in 2009 and made a<br>full professor earlier this year since<br>2007 david has led the digital library<br>research group taking over from<br>Professor Ian Witten who founded the<br>group in 1995 the digital library<br>project at wakad o has a strong open<br>source focus the best example of which<br>is the green stone project green stone<br>is a software tool with the aim of<br>empowering users particularly in<br>universities libraries and other public<br>service institutions to build their own<br>digital libraries it's used extensively<br>around the world and more than 70<br>countries with uses ranging from the<br>University of Chicago's collection of<br>japan two documents related to the state<br>of HIV and AIDS in rwanda has worked<br>with green stone has seen david<br>collaborate with several United Nations<br>agencies the BBC and various national<br>and regional libraries in 2004 the green<br>stone research team received the<br>prestigious NEMA award for its IT<br>development for humanitarian aid in his<br>time at Waikato david has continued to<br>broaden his interest in digital media<br>while retaining a particular emphasis on<br>music his research focuses on the<br>boundary between algorithmic content<br>analysis which is inevitably error-prone<br>and human-computer interaction in online<br>information systems the digital musical<br>library system meld X illustrates some<br>of the ideas he is exploring in the<br>musical domain including the ability to<br>retrieve songs by humming part of the<br>tune an interesting take on the oldest<br>musicians joke in the in the book you<br>have a few bars and I'll play along<br>david has published in the areas of<br>image processing music information<br>retrieval digital libraries<br>human-computer interaction spatial<br>hypermedia digital humanities data<br>compression and text mining so ladies<br>and gentlemen will you please join me in<br>welcoming to the podium to give his<br>inaugural professorial lecture professor<br>so thank you vice chancellor for that<br>introduction so the premise for my talk<br>today is if Mozart was alive today what<br>kind of software would you be running on<br>his laptop what kind of apps would he<br>have so here we have yeah Mozart here so<br>for the purposes of my talk I need to<br>take some artistic license really and<br>maybe the kind of Mozart I've got in<br>mind is more like this so this is from a<br>madea so if you think of that<br>effervescent larger-than-life character<br>portrayed in that movie that's kind of<br>musician I have in mind for some of the<br>demos i'm going to show you or perhaps<br>even this this chap here that's Elton<br>John if you can't like recognizing with<br>the wig at a live concert again playing<br>homage to talk to Mozart so I've<br>structured my talk around three parts of<br>the day from oats up in the morning he's<br>going to be composing at home in the<br>afternoon it's off to rehearsals and in<br>the evening he's going to be at Viennese<br>coffee shop unwinding so I need to<br>update that a little bit of course as<br>well so I mean they do have the Viennese<br>coffee shops but I'm thinking of a cafe<br>I'm thinking of a cafe with Wi-Fi okay<br>he's gonna be online and I'm playing a<br>bit of a musical game having some fun<br>hopefully now I've chosen these three<br>different areas because each of them<br>uses a different form of music so in the<br>first area composing I'm actually<br>thinking of audio just playing the piano<br>getting the audio recorded singing and<br>getting the information in so not so<br>much about writing music notation this<br>composing is direct audio in in the<br>afternoon actors rehearsals that's where<br>we're going to run a digital music stand<br>and look at sheet music and think about<br>that sort of side of things and then at<br>the cafe he's going to be playing a game<br>best way of describing days it's like<br>piano heroes if you know guitar hero<br>he's going to be playing a bit of piano<br>hero okay so each one of these comes<br>with a demo my fingers crossed and<br>things like that and i have an overview<br>a sort of picture of how this all fits<br>together for you so here we have mozart<br>with his with his laptop here and there<br>are three areas of computer<br>is that my research comes from and it<br>all comes to bear or in these these<br>demonstrations so music information<br>retrieval is where that content analysis<br>happens you're looking at images of<br>music working out where the staff lines<br>are the notes the key working out those<br>kinds of things with audio you may be<br>segmenting things into notes looking at<br>frequency analysis working at the<br>pictures and determining what the notes<br>being played are so that's music<br>information retrieval digital libraries<br>about organizing content so let's put<br>music content into digital libraries<br>browsing searching and things like that<br>and the last thing is the user interface<br>human-computer interaction how do you<br>design these things so they function<br>well for people given that back here<br>when you do content analysis the<br>computer isn't going to get it right<br>every time so you have to find ways of<br>softening some of the edges of of that<br>and I hope you'll see these three areas<br>come through in the demonstrations that<br>I'm i'm going to show you so we'll go<br>off and we'll go into composing first<br>now for composing music we already had a<br>project called expediting its spatial<br>hypermedia its inventors rob asking and<br>he was working with text and images and<br>vector graphics and things like that so<br>I got interested involved with what<br>would Oreo look like if you represented<br>it in this world so this is expediting<br>running here the names a little bit of a<br>joke if if X if Aphrodite is the goddess<br>of love then let expedite eb the goddess<br>of getting things done so that is the<br>it's the name of that software so in<br>fact I've been already running<br>expediting from from the beginning the<br>presentation has been done in expediting<br>so down here if I come down here and<br>click on the presentation link there's<br>my presentation from before if I click<br>in white space I come back and I'll<br>click into here I'm just going to show<br>you a little bit about expediting first<br>so you can then understand how the audio<br>and music content has been added in to<br>enrich things so here are the sort of<br>the three main areas that expedite e<br>already supported so if i come into text<br>and click on here you could write text<br>and change the size and the color and<br>the font whatever the mouse cursor is<br>when you start typing you get your words<br>you can pick it up and put it down you<br>can make copies and things like this so<br>it's a great authoring tool there's a<br>lot more you can do with it but sort of<br>creating czar mind maps and developing<br>ideas this way first and then gradually<br>turning them into documents this is sort<br>of the workflow that Rob has imagined<br>for this spatial hypermedia system so<br>over in graphics again I've sort of put<br>some things in already here we have<br>different shapes and lines you can sort<br>of draw your lines here you pick things<br>up and move them around and so on okay<br>so there's some vector graphics and<br>raster images of course I've put in some<br>Mozart pictures today okay so they're<br>the main building blocks of expediting<br>you can create powerpoint presentation<br>like things you can you can write papers<br>i've published a couple papers writing<br>the article first in expediting and then<br>generating the PDF from it and things<br>like that the big thing that expedites<br>brings and why i got interested in this<br>project is that it has this idea of<br>uniform interaction across all those<br>elements so when i come back into text<br>there are ways of making text bigger and<br>smaller okay and with this uniform<br>interaction if i come back to the<br>graphics i do the same thing of the<br>rectangle the exact same interaction is<br>makes a bigger and smaller okay and if i<br>come over to the images come down to<br>here same thing bigger and smaller so it<br>has this very sort of strong model of<br>how interaction should work and remember<br>the challenge for me is to think about<br>how audio might fit into this I want to<br>kind of keep the same kind of ideas that<br>have been developed and support audio as<br>a primary element in the system so I've<br>got one little extra thing in here that<br>I would like to sort of show which is of<br>the many things you can do if i kind of<br>right click and drag over this it copies<br>it out for you they're not a very<br>interesting fragment there we go okay<br>then I'm just going to delete that okay<br>so that copying you can sort of if I<br>came into images if I did that same<br>right dragging that's copying that and<br>I've just got myself a little excerpt<br>open things like that okay that's going<br>to be important for the music that will<br>that will come into play so let's go to<br>adding adding to music so here is again<br>I'm still running expedite because it's<br>already got the audio abilities built in<br>and switched on and we kind of give you<br>what I've called the music studio so we<br>have sort of some new elements around<br>the site here so these are all built out<br>of expediting we actually invented<br>something<br>interactive widgets as a which turned<br>out to be a very useful and powerful<br>idea to sort of support a lot of the<br>music content creation but also the<br>audio as well so i think i've been<br>talking a little bit too long let's just<br>find some audio and play it and sort of<br>get get on to it i'm going to do a text<br>search first i'm going to build up think<br>so here's me searching for good there's<br>a song called good times in the set of<br>set of pages that i have here so i<br>picked that up and put it into text and<br>off it goes doing a search so searching<br>through all the pages that I've got<br>there's over a thousand things like that<br>sort of in this particular set the my<br>music set so here we're down here let's<br>go to good times track to hear some<br>audio okay so this is an audio track<br>that's being worked on so we've got five<br>different tracks here you come along and<br>if you sort of let's come up should we<br>up to the lead lead vocals play he or<br>she was a finest thing there there so<br>that's that track the main play up peers<br>going to play all the tracks together so<br>so we'll see the organ coming in in a<br>you got to get up to the next guitar too<br>late we're gonna okay so here this yep<br>okay so that's how you sort of start to<br>build up audio you take mp3 files drag<br>them in drop them on it and it comes up<br>with these audio sort of wave players<br>and you can move them around and copy<br>them and in a little while I'll take a<br>cut and a copy out of it just like text<br>so we're trying to build all this and<br>give it the same kind of abilities as<br>before so let's come back to my sort of<br>main page for the music studio and just<br>click around a little bit more so over<br>here I've got my songs that I've been<br>developing over time sort of<br>alphabetically organized by title<br>where's my songs okay so for the purpose<br>of the evaluation there wasn't time for<br>people to create songs from scratch so<br>we said here's a set of well-known songs<br>imagine you've been developing them over<br>time and then we gave them certain tasks<br>to do to see how well they could<br>understand the interface and operate it<br>so you can browse by title but also down<br>here browse by lyrics and things and<br>used to get into these click on these<br>and see the songs so yep so we've got<br>browsing around to find things like that<br>let's go into this unnamed pop pop song<br>I was here practicing before I'm just<br>going to delete these these shouldn't be<br>here let me just delete those I'll just<br>I'll just be a bit easier if I do it in<br>front of me here you know what I'll just<br>maybe do that bit easier just thought of<br>that okay so um play let's seal this is<br>a song I mean if you've been reading the<br>lyrics down here you'll sort of work out<br>and I've had this musical moment I've<br>got this edition that I'd like to add to<br>the song to sort of try and develop it<br>get it to the next stage so there's<br>record over here gives me a little<br>countdowns gonna give me three second<br>countdown so this is to spare you<br>hearing me sing no I'll be I'll be<br>singing a bit later on but I've managed<br>to cut it down to just one okay so here<br>well this is mrs. me now I can sort of<br>see this bit of click let's have a<br>listen to them okay so let's use that<br>dragging thing right I just want this<br>bit here right let's grab that out okay<br>so now we've got that we can go off and<br>make that disappear and let's move this<br>up to here so here's the audio um if we<br>want to over here I can do beat<br>detection so we look at the spectrum in<br>the signal we look for note on sets and<br>look for patterns so you can go through<br>and sort of find the beats on the drums<br>it's quite easy to find and things like<br>this so the idea is you can use this and<br>you can start lining up your your audio<br>and things like this I've chosen this<br>one just for the sake of speed it turns<br>out you can stick your cars into this<br>song just about anywhere and it kind of<br>makes sense okay so yeah so here we have<br>four four little chickens going on in<br>there let's see how the song was<br>developed<br>yeah so when we started this project one<br>of the goals was it's like you know<br>artists have artist sketch pads they<br>just go out and they get sketching it's<br>like we wanted to be able to build the<br>same kind of system for a musician that<br>kind of sketching feeling and get things<br>out quickly and so on so obviously it's<br>just a short demo I think that check out<br>was just a little bit early if I might<br>just move it across there and things<br>like that okay so that's that one that<br>won their last thing I'd like to show in<br>this particular demo is the query by<br>humming so I mean it got got mentioned<br>in the introduction well we'll go with a<br>live one let's see how that goes i've<br>got a built-in mic to my laptop here so<br>there's this song that I'd like to find<br>in my set of set of files else I'll be<br>interested to see if anyone recognizes<br>it from the singing bit but but here<br>here we go so I start the record query<br>here hi Shep remember which song I'm<br>do-do-do-do-do-do-do right so it's off<br>searching this time it's searching<br>musically and I don't think it's found<br>it actually will drop in on this one oh<br>no I was I was not confident in my own<br>own ability so I sang doo doo doo doo<br>doo doo doo so let's have a little<br>listen<br>so I could have been any anywhere in the<br>audio and it finds it and things like<br>that but lets just hear the whole piece<br>so so I meant to pause and ask of anyone<br>so there we go so more than words by<br>extreme it it's going back a little<br>little while I didn't have any children<br>for example when that was a it was a hit<br>but they're not really connected in any<br>way are they right okay so this is kind<br>of demo one okay so we've been moving in<br>I've shown you a few things there's a<br>lot more that I could show you but I'd<br>like to like to move on and talk a<br>little bit about the context to this<br>work and so we have time for the other<br>two demos as well so in terms of papers<br>and articles that were written the<br>starting point for this special<br>hypermedia work actually goes back to<br>some digital library work that we did so<br>towards a digital library of popular<br>music which we presented at the main<br>digital library conference over in the<br>US and so that year that was wet which<br>had the original query by humming part<br>to it and then from that we were<br>contacted by an author writing for<br>Scientific American and they asked if<br>they could sort of feature it in there<br>seeking better web searches so we<br>provided some figures and think so that<br>meld X system that you heard about in<br>the introduction is written about in<br>there moving on to this actual full<br>interactive spatial hypermedia system<br>musical moments as the short version of<br>the title of the paper that we published<br>him we went through from her diary<br>studies we equip musicians with<br>dictaphones and and notepads with with<br>with blank staff lines and we find out<br>where people were when they had their<br>musical moments and wanted to create<br>songs and jot them down and we analyzed<br>what they were looking for and what the<br>requirements for the piece of software<br>and we were expecting to be out there<br>with mobile devices doing this kind of<br>stuff but in fact they were quite happy<br>with the software that they had and it<br>was more to do with when they got the<br>idea home and they wanted to enrich it<br>and develop it and when we wrote up the<br>requirements of what it was is it was<br>almost a near match for what the<br>definition of digital library is<br>organizing and managing your content<br>over time and things so this kind of led<br>us to combine the ideas of digital<br>libraries with the spatial hypermedia<br>system here so let's get back to Mozart<br>on his busy day so he's been developing<br>some Michael Jackson hits it would seem<br>in the morning and things like that it's<br>on to the rehearsal so he goes into town<br>for the concert hall so this is sheet<br>music I mean it could be done with<br>orchestras i'm going to be showing you<br>some some piano music here so here we<br>are running for the first time this is<br>green stone digital library you can be<br>you know if you can digitize it or have<br>it already in an online forum you can<br>put it into your into a green stone<br>digital library and build it so you can<br>search and browse around i mean if i<br>click on titles there's a bunch of sheet<br>music that I put into it so let's let's<br>go searching shall we saw I'll use<br>search and we'll go from Mozart so it's<br>a little bit small on the screen for you<br>to see so that's searching for Mozart<br>with composer search so here are the<br>sheet music that we have in this<br>particular digital library a lot of<br>duets where should we go let's come down<br>so the piano sonata in C minor let's<br>have a look at this one I could get a<br>PDF of it in sort of that's the end of<br>the digital library it says here's the<br>PDF off you go but the next one over<br>it's a music stand and we're going to<br>stay in the digital library and so the<br>first thing that it wants to do is it's<br>going to say well I'm going to give you<br>the sheet music and I'm going to have it<br>knows how big your display is so it<br>gives you the biggest piece of sheet<br>music that can comfortably fit on your<br>screen so this is really kind of more<br>designed for tablets you can be you know<br>browsing digital library it's going to<br>come on the tablet here and things like<br>that next thing that's happened is when<br>you built the digital library it's used<br>that optical music recognition software<br>that I've been working on so it's<br>finding staff lines this case we don't<br>need to go very far he's need to find<br>the star systems and the staff lines and<br>it's giving us a little marker down here<br>this is an interesting point in the<br>sheet music ok so when you play music we<br>all know that that last line of music is<br>a little bit awkward ok when I have to<br>turn the page so you know if I turn the<br>page too soon I'm going to have to<br>remember the rest of the notes or I<br>might be trying to do it a little bit<br>near the end and then sell so with the<br>digital music sign we can help you so of<br>it's sort of two features that i'll show<br>you in this particular demo the first<br>one is helping you with a page term so<br>the idea is that you're playing the<br>music along here anywhere in that last<br>line you can start a page turn and<br>what's going to happen is it's going to<br>bring it in over the top page 2 will be<br>drawn in over the top and you'll have<br>time to finish playing the rest of line<br>the bottom line and then you can come in<br>at the top<br>here so I'm going to go hands-free okay<br>let's let's start the page 2 ok so I'm<br>playing the last the last line here I've<br>got plenty time I can finish playing the<br>last line here then I'm up to the start<br>start here playing page 2 through that<br>okay so clearly for a laptop you'd<br>probably even want to up so we have<br>different versions of this that we've<br>worked on so for when you do a two up<br>for sheet music you can do page one here<br>page 2 here and then at any time during<br>page two you can bring up page three on<br>the left and so on so this one's happy<br>to work a little bit harder saying well<br>if you if your form factor is like this<br>then you know we can still give you<br>assistance but it's things you can space<br>a little bit more cramped and so it's<br>still helpful but clearly you know the<br>timing of the swipes have to sort of<br>match what you're doing so you you do<br>rehearsals and get the timing sorted out<br>and tweak it a little bit so if you know<br>you don't want it here you know you can<br>move this stuff up and down and things<br>like that this is one of those examples<br>my optical music recognition software Oh<br>staff detection 99 points something<br>percent accurate well that means that<br>you know you know within 100 pages of<br>music it's going to get it wrong okay so<br>you know when it sort of says I think I<br>think the last star system is here you<br>want to be able to come in and change<br>its they know it isn't it's down here<br>okay you can also type in annotations<br>and notes so this looks fairly<br>complicated let's go with watch<br>fingering okay you can type in us this<br>is our expedited idea again all this<br>kind of typing things in wherever you<br>are you can pick things up and move them<br>and all the rest so we've deliberately<br>given it that kind of feel there and<br>also these annotations now going to the<br>digital library so they're searchable so<br>now when you want to bring up a piece of<br>music you can search for annotations<br>that have these so you can even write<br>annotations which are just merely for<br>navigation to let you find it again or<br>it's more to do with the performance and<br>things like that so I I forgot to check<br>which which emperor of Austria was but<br>somewhere looking around here I kind of<br>typed one in a little bit earlier yep so<br>down here so help help me out its France<br>France Joseph the sec<br>and who was was Emperor when Mozart<br>first moved to Vienna and he famously<br>described Mozart's music as having too<br>many notes so i don't know if you can<br>make it out but too many notes and two<br>exclamation marks there so you know you<br>could if that's what you want to do you<br>can and things like that okay so let's<br>let's head back to the slides and so<br>we've seen the demo let's talk a little<br>bit about some of the work that went on<br>around about this so the first two<br>publications describe the work that I've<br>shown you the challenge of optical music<br>recognition was the image processing the<br>sheet music coming into the digital<br>library and connecting it with with that<br>kind of work there and then the actual<br>design of a music stand and working<br>through these things this is work I did<br>with Tim bell at Canterbury University<br>and he was trying it out he was he has a<br>band as gigs at weekends and stuff so he<br>was trying out this this software for us<br>and things like that excuse me so the<br>first two articles there are kind of<br>covered off in the demo that I've<br>showing you this next one here beyond<br>the client-server model self contained<br>portable digital libraries and so on so<br>here the idea is you actually install<br>the greenstone digital library server on<br>the tablet okay so I've now got a server<br>running here and then other people can<br>connect to me and pull the music music<br>off them so walk into rehearsals<br>conductor here's you know all the sheet<br>music that they're going to need for the<br>rehearsal and then the people sort of<br>sitting around can sort of well by the<br>time you've typed in the the web address<br>you can start pulling up the sheet music<br>on your your screens as well so this has<br>been quite a powerful thing we weren't<br>even we weren't doing this in the<br>musical context at the time in fact what<br>we were doing was thinking about these<br>kinds of computers here this is one this<br>is a 10 LPC's one laptop per child and<br>so the idea is that you can have a<br>digital library of content on here and<br>these former mesh network and you can<br>visit friends and so on so we had the<br>idea of beaming documents between the<br>two there's the international children's<br>digital library is in the public domain<br>so we built collections and green stone<br>on that and you can visit and view them<br>and if you like it you can say I would<br>like to add that into my digital library<br>okay so it's kind of it's it's like<br>checking you know<br>you check it out and sort of add it into<br>your digital library so we call that one<br>parameter for emulating libraries<br>because of course there used to be<br>mobile libraries that drove around you<br>know arrive at your door or in some<br>parts of the world as camels with book<br>strap to them and turn up and that's how<br>you get your books and your mobile<br>library so we kind of looked at those<br>ideas and talked about how they could be<br>mapped in and then shown a practical<br>demonstration of how it it all could go<br>the last item on the bottom they're<br>realistic books a bizarre Hommage to a<br>an obsolete medium this is again it<br>wasn't music work that we were doing<br>this is work I did with Professor Witten<br>and dr. Lisa putra who's up at Auckland<br>now and here the idea is we've lost a<br>lot by going to web pages with scroll<br>bars so having pages is kind of a good<br>thing in PDF get and gives you that but<br>having books having visual clues around<br>your documents that really enforce the<br>idea of a book you can sort of see the<br>pages to decide when you do searches it<br>can show you which pages and we're in<br>the book so they were so Veronica's work<br>in this area for her PhD went through<br>and sort of showed how you can make<br>people more effective if you present<br>your digital content through this kind<br>of metaphor so when you saw the page<br>tone it really did kind of fold and bend<br>and things like this and it had the<br>annotation note thing going in it as<br>well so these are all things that you<br>should bring into your your digital<br>music stand so where's the work at at<br>the moment so i was using some foot<br>pedals let me just to do the page turn<br>so this is this is the first one there<br>look there was a computer mouse that i<br>pulled apart and that's in here now and<br>this is my guitar pedal you wire it all<br>up you curse a few times and things like<br>that but in the end you finally get you<br>know when you when you click you get<br>mouse clicks and it can be wired up to<br>do page turns just like that that I<br>didn't mean to do right where am I so<br>let me just come back so we were in here<br>and we had gone to let me just go to<br>hear so how about the automatic page<br>turner how about the computers listening<br>to you and fall<br>you in the music so score following is a<br>technique they use dedicated Hardware<br>when they first started looking at this<br>problem and then desktop machines get<br>fast enough and they can start doing the<br>processing with desktop PCs in the lab<br>we decided we want well we're digital<br>libraries we do things in web browser so<br>we wanted to find out whether you could<br>do score following in a web browser so<br>this is kind of work that we're still<br>developing but the first thing you have<br>to do is first of all solve how do you<br>in a web browser access audio and<br>process it and follow a score from<br>someone's someone playing or singing<br>through it through a web page so the<br>first thing was to solve the technical<br>problem we got there and did that the<br>next thing was to do some experiments<br>and get some timing around whether or<br>not it's realistic to do this in real<br>time because you're running JavaScript<br>in a web browser to do this this is not<br>your natural environment to do signal<br>processing so the graph on the right<br>here is showing us that it can be done<br>so I'll just take you through the<br>numbers this is showing you sort of<br>percentage time so this is 0.25 up here<br>these bars here which is the score<br>following code it's running it's 0.1<br>that's like a tenth of a second for<br>every second of audio you need that you<br>want to process you only need a tenth of<br>a second to do the score following work<br>so that's yes that's faster than real<br>time and the different colored bars of<br>the different browsers we've got<br>Microsoft edge we've got firefox and<br>chrome so chrome is sort of the most<br>efficient for running this and so on the<br>other bar over here this is taking MIDI<br>events and rendering them as audio so<br>you can hear them sort of also part of<br>what the system needs to in fact you can<br>see that's more expensive so I had the<br>two together though you're still running<br>it about a third of a second so you can<br>do all this for every second of audio<br>you can track the person playing and you<br>can synthesize the accompaniment all in<br>a third of a second for every second of<br>audio that you want to process the graph<br>on the left is showing our algorithm<br>actually doing the score following so<br>what's happened here is the notes are<br>being played along the bottom here this<br>is a self similarity matrix so we're<br>playing audio along here and then the<br>the accompaniment is going down the left<br>here so the accompaniment knows what you<br>meant to be playing and you might be<br>going faster or slower so if you played<br>it very McCann<br>clear the perfect speed that the music<br>was mathematically written down for then<br>you'd get a perfect 40 45 degree line<br>here so you can see the person playing<br>here was actually quite close to you<br>know what the sort of sort of the less<br>expressive way of playing it is but<br>every time it kind of goes flat then the<br>accompaniment is having to slow down a<br>bit every time it goes steep it's having<br>to speed up and that's it working<br>through there so we haven't got that<br>working in a web browser yet doesn't we<br>haven't got it turning the page for you<br>scholar in the fall but we've got to the<br>first step which is to prove that it can<br>be done and it can be done with sensible<br>resources the next stage is to then<br>combine that so the sheet music when<br>you're playing it can start a page turn<br>for you and there's lots of usability<br>issues to think through that we haven't<br>even had even begun to to get into yet<br>but we've managed to prove we think this<br>is the world's first we're going to<br>write this up and send it to the music<br>information retrieval conference and see<br>how it goes down there but we think<br>doing this in a web browser that's with<br>were the first people to have done that<br>okay here we are back to the sort of<br>anchor slide last demo to get into so<br>we're off to the internet cafe and again<br>this is this is the digital library<br>software so the interface it's it's<br>reminiscent of vh1 a music TV station in<br>this particular case are matched their<br>sort of website and the idea is here we<br>want it sort of find videos of pop<br>music's and so have some fun read some<br>trivia about it play along okay that's<br>the kind of to kind of elements to it so<br>so for this one here let's go let's go<br>browsing shall we buy artists and my<br>random example that health chooses<br>pompeii by bastille so let's hit play<br>and let's at least now let's forget to<br>do this i want to see the pop-up trivia<br>let's switch on the pop-up trivia now<br>these things are going to be too small<br>to read for you so bastille is a<br>four-piece british indie band which was<br>formed in 2010<br>and what we got over here dan smith<br>seemed in the opening sequence of the<br>video is the lead singer and sort of so<br>it goes on so yeah you can sort of stab<br>guitar chords come up lyrics as various<br>various things that could be sort of<br>popping up and things like this so this<br>this idea started with there was a there<br>was an old TV show called pop up videos<br>which was a half-hour show on vh1 and<br>they took the videos and they kind of<br>baked in these pop-ups and just<br>broadcast it as a TV show so we started<br>by saying would love to do that only<br>we're going to do it in the digital<br>library and all these pop-ups are going<br>to be searchable and you can sort of<br>fine things that way and we're not going<br>to have the idea of you have to be sort<br>of you know in the TV station to be<br>allowed to do this anyone can register<br>log in and start providing this kind of<br>stuff yet so it's kind of a musical you<br>to be kind of kind of idea so that's the<br>first half so we've sort of seen pop-ups<br>and things like that that's not really<br>the bit I wanted to show you I want to<br>kind of come down a little bit further<br>I've mentioned playing along so we've<br>got a piano for example yeah in fact<br>let's go after this two pianos own let's<br>go organ yeah okay so we have have an<br>organ if you want to try to play along<br>with the organ with the drums let's do<br>simple so I mean clearly this is gonna<br>work best on a touchscreen but you know<br>I've got mouse clicking and keyboard<br>shift be if you know if you if you're on<br>a keyboard and have to sort of do it<br>that way and last but not least here<br>comes the guitar so let's give it a<br>chord and let's<br>now have had people comment that's the<br>left hand that's strong as a left-hand<br>guitar okay and so it feels a little bit<br>weird a little bit wrong I keep meaning<br>to put in a little switch so you can you<br>can make it go either way but for right<br>handed people we find this is the way<br>that people prefer to have it because if<br>you think about playing your guitar as a<br>right-handed people you do chords with<br>this sign and strum with its own so when<br>you're a touchscreen you want to do the<br>strumming kind of here which is kind of<br>why you have to show them a left-handed<br>guitar to make make it yeah okay anyway<br>I really must put the little switch in<br>and then people can go to whichever<br>version that they like okay and things<br>like this okay so let's let's close that<br>one up here and let's go back to the<br>beginning so this game thing that I've<br>alluded to that's a bit too soon yeah<br>yeah um so let's come down to here so I<br>have the video player mode it's in<br>neutral and it's something called game<br>on and for game on is I have melodies<br>and vocals it's a piano scroll kind of<br>idea i'll just open up game on okay so<br>this is going to come down the screen<br>heading towards us these are the notes<br>you meant to play in case this is the<br>sort of introduction of the song ok and<br>I'm going to play along on the piano ok<br>all going well so let's close up some of<br>these ok so I need to play now I'm just<br>gonna have a wee little bit of practice<br>get that signs of that right doesn't it<br>ok so we hit play ok and if you're not<br>playing along the audio is deliberately<br>made kind of sort of light and quiet so<br>I'll let one sort of cycle go through so<br>you can sort of hear that it's quieter<br>than last time when I play the right<br>note it gets louder and better yes<br>that's a bit tinny and yea i meant to be<br>playing notes right so it's you know<br>saying you're not doing a good job David<br>I<br>so you get the idea okay so you play<br>along you get the reward it sounds<br>better and all the rest of it so yeah<br>you know maybe Mozart after a long day<br>you know this could be a fun thing thing<br>to be doing maybe maybe not I'm not<br>entirely sure I care too much I do care<br>I do care i mean i do want him to have<br>fun and things like that because what<br>he's doing is he's secretly helping me<br>get symbolic information for what the<br>songs are i only started with the raw<br>video i don't have a clue any of the<br>notes that are being played or the cause<br>or anything so this idea of kind of<br>experts get reputations they can post<br>really cool versions of the chords and<br>challenges of notes to play and drums<br>and guitars and all this kind of stuff<br>so once i get the symbolic information i<br>can really leverage off that and for<br>example here with automatic analysis i<br>can find repeated structures so here<br>I've moved on this is david bowie's<br>starman and sort of the verse kind of<br>start twice and then there's a do to do<br>to do to do bit and and then this<br>fishing here there's the chorus with the<br>octave jump that's like somewhere over<br>the rainbow and so on yep so someone<br>might decide to key that in how do they<br>key it in well they just press the<br>record button then play the piano or the<br>guitar so in the same way I was playing<br>along if you're logged in you get a<br>record button and then you can record<br>yourself playing and then name it and<br>there's a little bit of editing and you<br>can sort of presented for others to try<br>and and match what you did but it's all<br>bit of a ruse it's to do with musicology<br>study and getting to the kind of notes<br>and enriching the set of music<br>information that we have so we get the<br>note viewer for free these blue boxes<br>and pink ones we can do key detection<br>now we know the notes we're no longer<br>thinking about frequencies and trying to<br>on a good day maybe work out the key we<br>really know what notes are being played<br>so chrome Hansel's key detection<br>algorithm if you know the symbolic notes<br>is there's the the best known algorithm<br>around for doing that but I always worry<br>about and what happens if it does go<br>wrong because it wasn't get it right<br>every time so the Edit ability that we<br>support in a digital libraries there as<br>well so it'll pre populate these things<br>and then you can look at them and go you<br>know what that one no and you just fix<br>it and get saved back into the digital<br>library so this is just another<br>interface through greenstone to the<br>digital library so we have two versions<br>of the digital library the kind of the<br>purple<br>one that you play play along with and<br>then the musicologist sneakily logging<br>in and visiting this other URL and sort<br>of accessing all the lovely rich<br>information that these other people have<br>provided for for them so why the context<br>publications so this is a very new kind<br>of area transforming musicology there's<br>been a couple workshops in the last two<br>years that we've had work except for and<br>published the the main group that<br>started this area of work is at Oxford<br>and they've asked me to come over later<br>on in the Europe what study least I'll<br>be visiting them and seeing where<br>they're up to and we'll sort of work on<br>some collaboration around that also<br>stepping outside of the music strand of<br>research for now but that broader<br>context of digital libraries we've been<br>looking at editing inside digital<br>libraries because this is something that<br>that a lot of librarians kind of a<br>cautious around I mean they've been<br>trained that you know you have you take<br>people who have knowledge about the<br>subject who then sort of provide<br>metadata and to simply say hey if you<br>can register and login you can enter<br>stuff into the digital library kind of<br>it it's very much at odds with that kind<br>of thinking so I think there's a<br>spectrum and I think it depends on the<br>kind of work that you're doing and if I<br>had to sort of emphasize a femen some of<br>this work is we're taking the ideas of<br>digital libraries and the kind of course<br>software components and repurposing them<br>in building other kinds of applications<br>out of them so that kind of game thing I<br>mean if you didn't know as a digital<br>library you wouldn't know you wouldn't<br>care it wouldn't be relevant so it's all<br>to do with perhaps enriching some of the<br>functionality that digital libraries<br>provide and you can sort of start<br>developing and doing more sort of<br>different tasks with the same<br>fundamental ability that was your<br>digital library software so I'm near<br>near the end here I've just got a couple<br>more slides slides to go so rather than<br>a conclusion since my first finale up<br>now have never done a finale performance<br>in my foots finale so the future of this<br>music information retrieval field is<br>really at multimodal music information<br>retrieval this is where you're trying to<br>combine these different representations<br>sheet music and audio and looking for<br>ways of connecting the two so part of<br>the reason why I'm here and giving this<br>talk<br>if anyone's out there thank you back hmm<br>I'm thinking of doing a masters or a PhD<br>this kind of stuff looks interesting do<br>come and talk to me I'd love to discuss<br>some project ideas with you ok so we a<br>bonus for me having had to sort of put<br>this put this together a few things to<br>remember the software it's all open<br>source the base systems are green stone<br>and expedite and they have the obvious<br>domain names that you can you can go and<br>find so the content that i'm showing you<br>isn't in them because they're just too<br>big to download and for music there's<br>copyright concerns but if you get going<br>with those and want to come back and<br>talk to me some more I can start showing<br>us some of the other bits that you add<br>in to start making it a digital music<br>stand or the the player long video stuff<br>also like me maybe after a couple days<br>we go what were the name of those two<br>things that ever talked about I can't<br>remember so if there are three words to<br>remember at the end of the talk it's my<br>name in the word research so just go to<br>any search engine Google on David<br>Bainbridge research you get to my<br>homepage it talks about the project<br>links to publications and you can follow<br>up on things from that there so my<br>premise what kind of software would<br>Mozart have on his laptop if he was<br>alive today well I can't really give you<br>any concrete are so I'm sorry it's a<br>perhaps a little bit of a an anti-climax<br>so I'd like to do something a bit more<br>concrete this is Howard good ole he's a<br>British composer ah he's well known for<br>a TV work so for theme songs for TV<br>shows mr. bean red dwarf vicar of dibley<br>Qi all these songs you might have heard<br>on the telly he's the composer and his<br>mission of books and television what<br>he's done he's written a book musical<br>big bangs and inside that I find this<br>kind of interesting sort of snippet<br>which is when he's away from his studio<br>he said as long as I have my musical<br>laptop with me then I'm fine for<br>composing I think i can get my work done<br>so i hope you agree with me that some of<br>the research ideas that i'm working on<br>and presenting here developed a little<br>bit further will clearly help support<br>and enrich the kind of tasks that<br>creative people so just calm composers<br>and musicians do and i'm hoping that<br>these kind of techniques will will help<br>them could be sort of even more creative<br>so as my final final slide<br>I make it sound like I did all this I<br>didn't bit of help along the way so it's<br>thanks to a cast of thousands i know i<br>will have missed out some some names i<br>do apologize but we're going to wrap<br>things up here i have one last<br>arrangement to play from expedite ease<br>music thing but it's five minutes long<br>okay so i'm not going to play it now but<br>maybe when the proceedings are finished<br>i'll come over and i'll i'll hit play so<br>when people are sort of heading out and<br>stuff like that you can get one last<br>blast of music from the talk and the bar<br>will be open I believe and I'm time to<br>chat to mingle so you have any questions<br>you know do come up and ask me so that's<br>me thank you very much thanks for coming<br>along<br>it's my task just sum up now there was<br>one important name you didn't leave off<br>David sir I'm glad to see mines there so<br>everything else is fine a few years ago<br>I just thought I'd mentioned this we<br>were on holiday in Vietnam and we were<br>in a one route bedroomed place and so<br>you had to wait a bit until everyone<br>passed out in order to go and do your<br>emails which you weren't really allowed<br>to do but did anyway they're just to<br>delete the emails that you didn't want<br>to read and I was doing this at about<br>ten o'clock maybe ten eleven o'clock and<br>along the way I send David an email now<br>the important thing to remember is that<br>Vietnam is 45 hours behind New Zealand<br>so if I'm doing that at ten o'clock it's<br>three in the morning in New Zealand and<br>I was a little surprised to get a<br>response straight away from David and so<br>I can appreciate that much of that work<br>and he didn't cover all of the work he's<br>done over the years he's been with us<br>was hard earned so my sympathies to a<br>net and the family uncle David will be<br>back with you soon kids so I think we do<br>have to appreciate all of that this<br>afternoon I went to another lecture my<br>own but given by Bill Rogers who talked<br>about the 1990s and ubiquitous computing<br>and this is the idea that the computers<br>would be like a servant to you that you<br>wouldn't know they were there and they<br>would just do things for you like a<br>butler finding your keys when you can't<br>find them as the advert displays and of<br>course that's never happened as one of<br>those ideas that sort of never really<br>took off and the reason one can think<br>about why that happened and am a sick<br>this because when we interact with<br>computers<br>we like to be entertained and so the<br>entertainment factor took over and made<br>sure that we needed to interact if you<br>go on any bus and look at anybody and<br>what they're doing even sadly having<br>dinner together they're all looking at a<br>device and interacting with it that<br>doesn't apply to me by the way because i<br>so so i do think that what David's done<br>is he's hooked into that and extended<br>all that work in the area of music<br>information retrieval so clearly you<br>know that Mozart would carry his laptop<br>into that cafe and use it all day just<br>as Howard good or wood what kind of<br>person would Mozart be he was probably<br>quite a tricky chap back then but with a<br>laptop he'd be spending a lot longer<br>composing those pieces so I think we'd<br>have more pieces with more notes<br>probably a few upset people in charge<br>and probably a few problems you know<br>that the psychologist would have to deal<br>with with with mr. Mozart but generally<br>I think he'd be pretty happy working<br>away on his machine so thank you David I<br>just like to ask everyone to join us<br>afterwards and David those questions<br>bill wants to know whether the pixels<br>would dry on any of those demos a<br>reference to them being done today some<br>of them and join us to ask questions and<br>I'd like to finally just ask you to<br>thank David further marvelous<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
