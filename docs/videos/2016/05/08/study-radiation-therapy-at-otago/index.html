font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the study of RT encompasses the<br>theoretical and the practical components<br>so the program setups of the first year<br>is theory second and third year half of<br>it is practical and half of its theory<br>things that we're looking at for study<br>in the academic is anatomy and<br>physiology the study of radiation<br>therapy and that's including physics the<br>cell types how we actually apply the<br>radiation and then some of the specific<br>things around radiation therapy planning<br>so some of the real experts of the job<br>you'll also do so we need think about<br>University you think that you sort of<br>have a lecture sort of like for a day<br>maybe solo there for hours while at<br>Wellington that's sort of like 94 when I<br>started studying it was a bit of a shock<br>to the system because I was a school<br>leader and most of the class is coming<br>from how science or other studies but it<br>was really good and the sense that<br>everything that we were learning was<br>relevant to what we were going to be<br>doing you get to spend two weeks on<br>clinical blessin it's probably a few<br>professions that you have clinical<br>within your first year so it's really<br>good for like right from the onset to<br>hear bits sort of contact with the<br>patient in sort of like seeing what are<br>this you're going to do in your<br>professions and the clinic the students<br>will always rotate around all of the<br>areas that we work and so they'll be<br>rostered into the CT<br>to our planning department where we<br>design the best way to deliver the<br>treatment and then into the actual<br>treatment machines as well you've got a<br>bit empathetic person but also not let<br>things bring you down so you're doing<br>with patients that do have cancer<br>they're coming to you for treatment they<br>sort of come to you and they're quite<br>vibrant so that you're smiling happy and<br>you meet them with a smile and we start<br>to like build a really good rapport with<br>them it's such a rewarding job most<br>people when I tell them about what I'm<br>doing that like that must be so sad but<br>until you're actually in here and<br>actually see how much as like a happy<br>environment and it actually is it's<br>something special and a lot of people<br>don't really get to experience it you<br>also need to have an interest in science<br>and the technology the technology is<br>always changing it's very exciting area<br>so it's those mixture of the two the<br>keyring and empathy for the patient as<br>well as the technology you need to have<br>some really good team skills you need to<br>have good problem-solving skills so you<br>need to be able to sort of identify what<br>the issue is and what actually need to<br>take some order to resolve it when I<br>graduate I'd like to work in New Zealand<br>for a couple years I think the New<br>Zealand medical standards are so high to<br>be really good to get some experience<br>here for a couple of years and then look<br>to travel I've been working for just on<br>a you know everything becomes a lot more<br>ingrained you don't have to think about<br>stuff in the same way you do as a<br>student but it's actually really<br>rewarding working with people seeing<br>them up to sort of just about 40 40 days<br>in a row so in that sense it's really<br>rewarding getting to know them one of<br>the great things about our qualification<br>is that we can work in<br>really with New Zealand radiation<br>therapist a highly sought after around<br>the world we have a highly regarded<br>degree and the door is open to most</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
