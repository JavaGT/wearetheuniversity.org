Kolb, Professor of Connectivity in the Business School's Graduate School of Management, explains why the "internet of things" is the next big thing.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>people are now referring to the Internet<br>of Things as being the next big thing<br>and there are probably two reasons for<br>that first of all there are actually<br>more devices connected on the internet<br>than there are people on earth so if we<br>think about that for a moment there are<br>actually more things on the Internet<br>than most of us imagine and second of<br>all as some authors that MIT have<br>pointed out that it's come on suddenly<br>because of some of the developments have<br>been happening slowly over the years and<br>we might think of it as the way a person<br>goes broke they say we go broke<br>gradually and then suddenly so there's<br>been exponential growth in terms of<br>processing and exponential growth in<br>terms of the reach of the Internet and<br>those factors have come around to where<br>we're seeing a very rapid improvement in<br>the way machines can talk to one another<br>another way to think about the Internet<br>of Things and its importance is that it<br>represents sort of a third wave of<br>technology transformation the first<br>being automation when we were able to<br>take humans not out of the picture but<br>make machines smarter and able to do<br>things from about the 50s and 60s the<br>next of course was the Internet and the<br>world wide web which started in the mid<br>90s and now of course we take that for<br>granted but the Internet of Things is a<br>technology of sensors that feed<br>information into the web and make<br>products smarter make businesses more<br>capable and make us as human beings more<br>connected than ever before at a personal<br>level we might already be experiencing<br>some benefits from the Internet of<br>Things a couple of examples are the<br>recent interest in biofeedback so for<br>example fitbit's and devices that come<br>along with the iWatch etc to monitor and<br>give us back some information about<br>ourselves the other example you could<br>use at an inn at a personal level is we<br>all know about maps and we all know how<br>smart phones can guide us places but a<br>current<br>that people might be familiar with is<br>called ways and the difference between<br>ways and a traditional mapping<br>technology is that it actually measures<br>the progress of other people traveling<br>in and around the city the area you are<br>traveling so it knows exactly how fast<br>traffic is moving on a motorway for<br>example so this is using sensors from<br>devices around us who we don't even know<br>about but they're feeding through the<br>application infrastructure to give us a<br>better sense of making a turn or not in<br>terms of our own progress in real time<br>which is different than say Google Maps<br>now for businesses the Internet of<br>Things has many many possibilities at a<br>very basic level people are already<br>using it to monitor things such as crops<br>and farmers for example or tracking<br>cattle with RFID now these are kind of<br>minimal and basic but important<br>applications also I've heard of people<br>who can now you can now use GPS tracking<br>of cell phones they simply know where a<br>Salesforce is going or where a<br>transportation industry drivers are<br>going that sort of thing so monitoring<br>is important but more importantly<br>there's a transformation opportunity<br>when businesses can use the information<br>coming from devices and use that more<br>carefully to get closer to customers or<br>to serve customers differently and that<br>is where we might see some significant<br>transformations so the device for<br>example itself is still important the<br>physical device but the ability for the<br>device to translate sense again and<br>translate information back to its maker<br>or to other users is important and then<br>ultimately to be able to analyze those<br>data and to make different value<br>propositions to the user<br>massive possibilities in this space<br>practical applications for the Internet<br>of Things the sensors in particular are<br>quite developed in primary production so<br>for example the amount of spray that a<br>farmer puts onto fields or into orchards<br>has been monitored for quite a long time<br>through the machinery it's actually<br>delivering the chemical so that has some<br>benefits and<br>terms of being more accurate and not<br>over spraying or overlapping and this is<br>of course coordinated with GPS<br>technology so that's quite developed in<br>sectors that are important here in New<br>Zealand so we have that at another level<br>if we go back to biological feedback<br>there are now innovations that allow us<br>to know more and better about ourselves<br>at a personal level so we can actually<br>own the data or get the data from our<br>own bodies say more quickly and without<br>relying on medical systems and actually<br>it's possible now for pharmaceutical<br>drugs to be embedded with little<br>microchips that let let the manufacturer<br>other people know when they're being<br>consumed now this feels a bit strange in<br>a way but actually not taking drugs is<br>one of the biggest problems that the<br>medical service field has is to make<br>sure that people actually take the drugs<br>that are prescribed to them so something<br>as simple as that could possibly help<br>the the health of the planet and<br>individuals we've talked about some of<br>the upsides some of the best case in<br>areas of the internet of things but<br>technology often is a double-edged sword<br>so one of the concerns that people will<br>of course quickly figure out as concerns<br>about security and privacy and believe<br>me the more that our devices talk back<br>to their maker or talk to any other big<br>system that's immediate and and a big<br>concern a true concern and a lot of that<br>concern has not been worked out yet so<br>if consumers are buying products that<br>relay data back to other sources we<br>fundamentally have to trust the company<br>that's providing us with that device but<br>we also have to think about what else we<br>might do in terms of regulation and so<br>there's some really serious issues<br>around security and privacy the other<br>factor of course is that with all these<br>data being translated since translated<br>and interpreted where do we store the<br>data the we don't call big data for<br>nothing a good example is that the<br>engines that are used on the dream line<br>or the new<br>generation of Boeing's aircraft they<br>produce one terabyte of data per day per<br>plane now if you think about it that's a<br>lot of data so obviously it can be used<br>for the better improvement of the system<br>better improvement of efficiency etc but<br>just the sheer multiplication<br>multiplication of data is a massive<br>factor and that leads us to the other<br>issue which is infrastructure so of<br>course the internet is an infrastructure<br>component and again the quality the<br>robustness and the sort of pervasiveness<br>of the infrastructure is a key issue as<br>this Internet of Things develops it's<br>often hard to recognize a revolution<br>even when you're in the midst of one so<br>what's your business think about I mean<br>on one hand some of these things will<br>come and go and be a g-wiz factor but<br>not serious but some of this technology<br>and some of the technologies we've<br>talked about could be quite disruptive<br>so I think business needs to pay<br>attention to some of the ways that the<br>Internet of Things is changing their<br>customers expectations it might change<br>what they can deliver in terms of smart<br>devices or minimally they need to pay<br>attention to what it might be doing in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
