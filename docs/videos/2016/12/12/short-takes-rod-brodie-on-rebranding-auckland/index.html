font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>why do we need city branding or thinking<br>about city branding is Auckland competes<br>in an international market it competes<br>in the local market and an international<br>market and so we need to have something<br>which is distinctive which will attract<br>business investment tourism students and<br>this comes from developing an integrated<br>branding strategy the reason that your<br>brand is that you want to have something<br>which is distinctive and so that is to<br>do with the identity so you need a<br>distinctive identity but that's not<br>everything because the real strength of<br>the brand doesn't come from just its<br>identity it comes from the meanings<br>which are associated with the identity<br>so if we're thinking of cities that are<br>doing branding world well there's a<br>number of cities in the world which are<br>branding or rebranding and this is going<br>on one I'm familiar with is Adelaide and<br>its rebranding and it's moving from what<br>was a very simple identity which was to<br>do with tourism to a far broader<br>identity if we take Auckland the same<br>things going on we head the brand city<br>of sales from city of sales is important<br>but it's not everything it is only one<br>story or one meaning and so when we look<br>at city branding successful City<br>branding what you have is a number of<br>stories and a number of meanings so in<br>order to portray multiple meanings not<br>one meeting then you need to have<br>collaboration between what we would say<br>is the different stakeholders or the<br>different interested parties and so<br>essentially it is mobilizing the<br>community and so this is not only media<br>this is the City Council this is the<br>tourism this is education there needs to<br>be a communications campaign which is<br>going to engage these different parties<br>think of branding as a brand<br>architecture and so the what happens<br>with the Auckland City branding it is<br>part of the broader<br>picture of branding and New Zealand so<br>this is our national brand and then some<br>also some very important ones like<br>tourism Air New Zealand plays an<br>important role and so this needs to be<br>coordinated together so there's a<br>consistency in this stories which are<br>being told so if we take the national<br>brand in they've moved to the New<br>Zealand story and so this is really a<br>very broad idea about what New Zealand<br>represents and open places open<br>attitudes to work and emphasizing this<br>very collaborative multicultural society<br>so this acts as an umbrella for the<br>branding of other entities such as<br>Auckland once we talk about meaning and<br>stories it's not just the agency which<br>is creating the story the meanings are<br>co-created with the different groups or<br>stakeholders and so while there can be<br>an element of design in the branding it<br>can't be controlled and so this is why<br>the communication getting the right<br>meaning some meanings that people in the<br>communities identify with and this is<br>what becomes very important so if we<br>look at success and city branding then<br>we need to look at cities which are<br>doing this really well and take<br>Copenhagen that's done it particularly<br>well yeah it has a very distinctive<br>identity in terms of the mermaid but<br>when you look at Copenhagen branding it<br>is much more than that it is an<br>environmental city that is a city which<br>has education tourism also a lot of<br>innovation and technology and so all of<br>those things come together and so when<br>we're looking at the city branding of<br>Auckland<br>we need to benchmark with some of these</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
