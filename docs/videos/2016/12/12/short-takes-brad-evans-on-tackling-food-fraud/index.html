font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the problem of counterfeits on a global<br>basis is significant if you look at it<br>from an International Chamber of<br>Commerce standpoint they're saying we're<br>at roughly 600 billion dollars a year<br>crossing borders they suggest that will<br>cross the one trillion dollar mark<br>anytime soon to put that in perspective<br>that is approaching the annual revenue<br>of Walmart when I talk the six hundred<br>billion dollars or it's five times the<br>annual revenue of fmc jayant Procter &amp;<br>Gamble of course food fraud differs from<br>say apparel or footwear luxury goods<br>here in New Zealand we know we've got<br>issues with things like kiwi fruit<br>manuka honey that's not to say that<br>apparel isn't also affected I certainly<br>know that brands like Karen Walker have<br>been affected by the counterfeiters and<br>we've got some other big brands that we<br>need to keep an eye on from a food fraud<br>standpoint New Zealand exporters we've<br>obviously seen some incidents around<br>melamine in the milk powder now the<br>interesting thing there is yes an export<br>product but the adulteration to the<br>product happened overseas so there<br>wasn't this cross-border opportunity to<br>intercept it by customs agencies or the<br>like so so there's certainly that<br>happening I mentioned manuka honey and<br>kiwi fruit earlier we know that manuka<br>honey the amount that can be produced<br>here in New Zealand or in Tasmania the<br>combined volume there's five times as<br>much being sold globally as we produce<br>in our two countries Australia New<br>Zealand so it just just goes to show the<br>issue of concern to New Zealand<br>obviously or maybe not so obviously is<br>the fact that there's this whole country<br>of origin thing that happens so if a<br>brand is affected certainly the retailer<br>selling the product sees the issue and<br>gets hit by it the brand owner gets hit<br>by it but more concerning<br>the recent Walmart study that I saw<br>where they interviewed consumers and<br>asked you know what would be the effect<br>on their purchase behavior around being<br>or seeing counterfeit good stories etc<br>etc and it was actually country of<br>origin that suffered the longest in the<br>consumer mind in terms of before how<br>long it would be before they went back<br>to that brand that came out of specific<br>country from a brand protection<br>standpoint what can the brain donor do<br>to be more proactive I think that's the<br>key word up to this point a lot of the<br>activities have been very reactive very<br>legally focused around copy Mart<br>trademark patent things like that that's<br>got to change we need to be far more<br>proactive and work towards preventative<br>and protective measures versus this wait<br>to be impacted and try and figure it out<br>from there if you want to get into<br>specifics around prevention there's<br>really emerging technologies that brand<br>owners can look at whether you're<br>talking apparel or food sector you know<br>I should mention to you know I've seen<br>some interesting work by Homeland<br>Security in the US where they've<br>actually categorized the types of food<br>fraud that are going on and or the<br>fraudsters and and the issue really is<br>that you've got three types one is the<br>the disgruntled employee who's looking<br>at getting back at their employer for<br>whatever reason and in any way they can<br>there is the terrorist who is quite<br>happy for people to know what they've<br>done and thirdly there is the people who<br>are doing it for economic gain you know<br>they want to keep it under the radar but<br>at some point someone eventually finds<br>out how do you deal with those three<br>types I think you really need to be<br>broadcasting the fact that you are doing<br>preventive things and there's various<br>ways of doing that but from a supply<br>chain standpoint you really just need to<br>make sure people know even if it's just<br>on a<br>a selective basis you're doing testing<br>you're paying attention you're you<br>really have it on your radar screen is<br>the message you need to be communicating<br>to people from a cross-border standpoint<br>as I said earlier a lot of the food<br>activities are no longer crossing border<br>they're happening internally so again<br>various authorities the regulators are<br>going to have to get involved in this<br>and and to be fair they have been but<br>they really are going to have to start<br>paying attention on a wider scale as to<br>how we prevent this this type of<br>activity I guess the bottom line is that<br>this is a different world today we live<br>in than 15 or 20 years ago and food<br>manufacturers distributors importers<br>really need to take a strategic approach</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
