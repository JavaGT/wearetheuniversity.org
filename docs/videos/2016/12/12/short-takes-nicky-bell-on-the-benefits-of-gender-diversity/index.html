the benefits of gender diversity in the workplace.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well in New Zealand we actually have a<br>real history of progressiveness around<br>gender diversity but the unfortunate<br>thing is when our stagnating so<br>year-on-year the statistics aren't<br>changing much in terms of women at high<br>levels of leadership and participation<br>in the economy for example only 5% of<br>CEOs and chair persons in New Zealand<br>are women so a greater balance of gender<br>diversity and any kind of diversity<br>actually at the senior leadership levels<br>of organisations has been proven to<br>drive greater levels of innovation with<br>an accompanying creativity greater<br>levels of motivation within the company<br>and really importantly stronger<br>financial performance and more broadly<br>in the world greater participation of<br>women in their communities in their<br>countries so in instances where women<br>are more equal in their countries and<br>their communities you see greater<br>democracies at play you see less<br>instability less conflict and really<br>healthier functioning environments so<br>what all that leads to from my point of<br>view is a bit of a revelation about this<br>topic so beyond it being unfair and<br>beyond the debate around equality for<br>women in the world which is obviously<br>still paramount is now you start to see<br>that when women participate more fully<br>in leadership roles whether it be in<br>their communities or their countries or<br>businesses you see greater success and I<br>should say now what I'm not saying is<br>that women should dominate in those<br>roles and only women should lead because<br>the studies really back up the fact that<br>greater balance of diversity of any kind<br>and leadership roles is what where the<br>magic comes in in terms of success for<br>companies they all go through things<br>like high levels of innovation and<br>creativity are driven through companies<br>much stronger financial performance<br>through companies greater team<br>psychological safety willingness to<br>experiment team retention and they're<br>you know there are many many different<br>ways this has been proven over and over<br>again I guess one of the most<br>interesting things that I found when I<br>was researching this topic was that<br>analyst and shareholder agencies now are<br>specifically looking for the gender<br>index within a company so they're<br>looking at the number of women on the<br>board they're looking at the number of<br>women participating at the leadership<br>team level because that's so proven to<br>predict the financial success of the<br>company what we're really talking about<br>though is not women for women's sake and<br>not women to fill quotas and not women<br>to make sure that it looks right on the<br>balance sheet what we're talking about<br>is qualified women who are clearly right<br>for the job<br>being put in place so that there can be<br>greater diversity of perspectives<br>brought to the table there are many<br>studies that have been done over the<br>years that look at the issue of bias in<br>the workplace and in fact so many that<br>people now talk about you know the<br>admiration of the problem so many of the<br>studies stopped short at just saying<br>there's bias and there's a problem for<br>women because bias exists what I think<br>is a better way to think about it is<br>social scientists say bias really exists<br>as young as the age of you know 3 when<br>we're all little we understand and pick<br>up from our families who's the in group<br>and who's the out group and there's this<br>that it begins so anybody that says that<br>they don't have biases probably not<br>telling the truth because we all do how<br>this manifests itself for women in the<br>workplace is that there are inbuilt<br>gender stereotypes that a lot of people<br>have about women and when they're being<br>interviewed for jobs or when they're<br>going through performance evaluations<br>people use bias which is really a<br>cognitive shortcut a way to not to have<br>to make so many decisions how do I<br>quickly make a snap decision about this<br>and they default to things you know you<br>hear it talked about all of all the time<br>in the literature like the motherhood<br>penalty so she's a mother and they start<br>to think through but is she a good<br>mother will she be you know she'll be<br>good to her children or on the flip side<br>is she committed to the job is she<br>really going to be able to deliver now<br>that she's had children and so those<br>kind of biases come into play there's<br>the likability penalty when women lead<br>it's<br>uncomfortable for many people because<br>they were brought up to think that women<br>should be behaving in a certain way and<br>not necessarily leading in the way that<br>women lead and so it's those biases that<br>tend to trip up women along the way but<br>there are many companies that are doing<br>a lot of work in this area New Zealand<br>Defence Force New Zealand police a lot<br>of the banks in New Zealand are looking<br>at bias whether it be conscious or<br>unconscious and trying to really work<br>through that and make sure that that's<br>not an inhibitor for women in the<br>workforce I think the most critical<br>thing is is that it's led by the top so<br>that the CEO of the organisation has<br>informed educates people and is very<br>clear about the business case for<br>diversity when they don't get within<br>that organisation I think the the error<br>is to try and put that to the HR<br>department and say it's an HR<br>responsibility so I think first of all<br>CEO led direction on that I then think a<br>link to the business strategy is really<br>important so a lot of the companies that<br>I've been talking to look at this as a<br>competitive advantage and a potential<br>competitive advantage so yes it's about<br>equality yes it's about fairness and<br>inclusion but actually if they get it<br>right you can see the effects that will<br>have on the business I think first and<br>foremost I would give advice to young<br>women in business to really understand<br>themselves and understand what's unique<br>about themselves so in the past I think<br>we all used to look to establish set<br>models and ways of leading and compare<br>ourselves to those and say could I do<br>that and if I can't see myself in that<br>situation that I can't be that person or<br>I can't have that job whereas I think<br>what's happening now is there are much<br>more progressive role models for<br>leadership out in the world and I think<br>understanding you know it sounds funny<br>but understanding your unique power your<br>superpower and building around that and<br>becoming your own leader is really<br>important advice I also think taking on<br>big challenges is important I think you<br>know there's a famous statistic that men<br>jump in when they're sixty percent ready<br>and women wait until they're 100 percent<br>ready and I think the men are right to<br>do that and I think you know a lot more<br>young women that I see I talked to and<br>say<br>jump in take that challenge you can<br>actually do it now and then there's two<br>more things that I would advocate for<br>young women now the resilience is as<br>important as it ever was I think Hillary<br>Clinton describes it as you know taking<br>criticism seriously because you might<br>learn something but never taking it<br>personally because it will get personal<br>and I think delineating between the two<br>is really important and listening and<br>making sure that you're resilient enough<br>to to listen to that criticism and<br>process it in the right way and the<br>other thing we spend a lot of time<br>talking about is confidence and this is<br>a this is a real problem for a lot of<br>young women coming up in any industry<br>because they fundamentally can be doing<br>an incredible job they can be nailing<br>all aspects of the job but you see at<br>time and time again on performance<br>reviews where people end up saying I<br>just wish she'd be a bit more confident<br>and the problem with that is that can<br>actually sound like another criticism<br>for them I think it's if you do these<br>things I'm talking about a finding who<br>you really are and what you could<br>uniquely bring to the tape or rather<br>than comparing yourself to others and<br>working really hard and being resilient<br>then I think you can overcome some of<br>those confidence issues that I'm talking<br>about</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
