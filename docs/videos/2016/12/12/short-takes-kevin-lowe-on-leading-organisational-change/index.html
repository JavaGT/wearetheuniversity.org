style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>change is always an opportunity and so<br>organizations need to be focused on<br>change not as something to be avoided<br>but rather as an opportunity for<br>organization success why do so many<br>change efforts fail the literature tells<br>us that the best case scenario is that<br>fifty percent of organizational change<br>efforts fail and the estimates are as<br>high as eighty percent so when you think<br>about that if if we're going to do these<br>major things that are costly that are<br>disrupted the organization what is it<br>that causes so many organizations to<br>fail and there's a number of very good<br>change models that give us some insights<br>into what the processes and procedures<br>are that enable effective change efforts<br>and yet organizations ignore them time<br>and time again and perhaps the biggest<br>one in that whole group is this notion<br>of impatience a change requires<br>significant time in many times an<br>organization's we get impatient once<br>someone gets clear about what needs to<br>change then they want everyone else to<br>change as clearly as quickly as they did<br>it's top management that typically sees<br>change first because the very nature of<br>their job is to be outward facing<br>talking to stakeholders governments<br>other organizations so the very nature<br>of their job first of all is outward<br>facing so they're more likely to see the<br>reason for change first and secondly<br>it's their job to think about how the<br>organization needs to change so let's<br>say it takes them six months eight<br>months to get clear on the need for<br>change there then going to now be ready<br>to roll that message down to middle<br>management in middle management needs<br>that same six months eight months to get<br>clear that they need to get behind the<br>change and then when you think about the<br>lowest levels the organization you've<br>got another six to eight month window<br>but what we often see is it<br>organizations once we get clear at the<br>top we want everyone else to not need<br>the time that we needed to adjust to the<br>change and that's what all the change<br>literature says is that's really to do<br>effective change you need a minimum of<br>for years and when you're talking about<br>large-scale change in very large<br>organizations like an IBM or an Oracle<br>that often a change effort can take as<br>much as 10 years to be effectively<br>implemented and roll all the way out so<br>among the processes that enable<br>effective organizational change is to<br>build a powerful coalition and often<br>when we think about who's powerful and<br>organization we make the mistake of<br>pulling out the organizational chart and<br>saying oh these people here must be<br>powerful because they are at the top of<br>the organization and yet we know in<br>every organization and we've got more<br>sophisticated about knowing this through<br>network analysis there are people in<br>every organization who we might label as<br>influencers who sit at different places<br>in the organization they're the hubs of<br>opinion they're the thought leaders and<br>those thought leaders often have little<br>to do with the formal hierarchy so<br>someone who's going to engage in<br>effective change effort is someone who<br>identifies who the influencers are who<br>can bring the others along to use Jim<br>Collins's phrase to get the right people<br>on the bus and it's also important that<br>according to most of the change experts<br>that while it's okay to have a notion of<br>a vision for the change the vision<br>usually changes a bit just from having<br>identified that powerful coalition<br>because if you get those people in the<br>room who are the influencers they have<br>their pulse on the organization they can<br>feed things back into the change process<br>that perhaps allow us to see obstacles<br>ahead of time that we wouldn't otherwise<br>if we had just used hierarchy to roll<br>the change through organizational<br>culture can certainly enable or hinder<br>change and in some ways it depends upon<br>how far you're moving from the existing<br>culture to a different culture Edgar<br>Schein who is perhaps sort of leading<br>guru on organizational culture defines<br>culture as a set of policies practices<br>and procedures that have made you<br>reasonably successful in the past and<br>therefore are taught and learned as the<br>way to do things and so if we think<br>about where culture comes from it's not<br>this amorphous it is<br>of a natural selection of process that<br>successful organizations have either<br>done sometimes intentionally or<br>sometimes stumbled through but for<br>whatever reason what they have been<br>doing has made them successful and as<br>each new hire is hired they're taught<br>this is the IBM way or this is the<br>Oracle way or this is the General<br>Electric way and so what we are doing<br>oftentimes when we're asking people to<br>change is we're asking them to give up<br>their very identity and I think that's<br>why we see cultural change being so<br>difficult when you give up your identity<br>your your morning the are you should be<br>mourning the past the thing that brought<br>you there is no longer the thing that's<br>going to get you to the next place and<br>so we can see some spectacular examples<br>of bankruptcies where organizations just<br>failed to change the culture was such<br>that the bureaucracy was so important<br>the titles you know how many lights you<br>had in your office and what sort of<br>plant you had in the corner defined who<br>you were and where you stood in the<br>hierarchy the notion of entitlement<br>around benefits if we look at the<br>airline industry which has been very<br>dynamic you think about a company like<br>Pan Am that was very early to<br>international markets and in some way<br>owned the world internationally they<br>wound up going bankrupt because they<br>couldn't let go of those bureaucratic<br>bureaucratic processes those mechanisms<br>that were expensive of and made sense in<br>a period of time when you owned the<br>global market the process of change is<br>just as hard maybe more difficult in<br>small and medium-sized enterprises<br>because often the organizational culture<br>and those sorts of organization is a<br>real family culture or clan culture is<br>sort of the literatures word for that<br>family culture and families have a<br>particular way of operating and it's<br>very nuanced in some ways it's<br>emotionally charged because we feel so<br>much collective bonding and when we go<br>through and say the way we have worked<br>together has to change that can be<br>extremely difficult so in some ways we<br>may find change the change process more<br>difficult the stronger the culture is<br>and those very strong cultures are as<br>likely to occur may be more likely to<br>occur and small and medium enterprises<br>so the notion of what it what effective<br>change looks like applies really to<br>organizations of all size and we can't<br>necessarily equate large size with more<br>difficult when we think about the role<br>of the leader an organizational change<br>and we could go back and forth about<br>whether it's the leader or the<br>leadership group but however we might<br>consider where leadership comes from at<br>the moment the role of the leader is<br>really to make sense of why the change<br>needs to occur for the organization the<br>biggest reason we see resistance to<br>change is that people feel that the<br>change is being done unto them as<br>opposed to the change being something<br>that they are part of people like the<br>change that they choose they don't like<br>the change that they feel like is<br>imposed on them so part of what the<br>leader needs to do is develop a<br>compelling story about why the world has<br>changed what we need to do about it<br>including the organizational how the<br>organizational culture needs to change<br>the organism that he needs to think<br>about how to build a compelling story<br>that's a big enough tent for everyone to<br>get under and different groups the<br>organization care about different things<br>some people care about flexibility some<br>people care about being innovative some<br>people care about extreme levels of<br>customer service so what I need to do is<br>the leader is to figure out what you<br>care about and roll the the core of that<br>story out and involve people in a way<br>that touches them personally touches<br>them emotionally has them holding their<br>hand up saying I want to be a part of<br>that as opposed to oh my gosh here we go<br>again and they're doing unto me version<br>6.0 and so if we really get back to me<br>elite a really good leader is a really<br>good storyteller and a really good story<br>needs to be based on facts needs to be<br>based on the market we need to have a<br>compelling reason to change rather than<br>sometimes people feel like we're<br>changing just for the sake of change<br>that doesn't enroll anyone but if we<br>think about leadership and changes in<br>enrollment process<br>and what does it take to enroll every<br>person in the organization we're much<br>more likely to move towards an effective<br>change now I won't pretend that you<br>don't have five percent of the people in<br>the organization whose favorite indoor<br>sport is complaining about everything<br>you can't always get a hundred percent<br>of the people on the bus but I do think<br>you can have measured processes around<br>storytelling around making people part<br>of that story that will bring most of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
