font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>today's computers are really smart they<br>can see things they can speak and they<br>can even play the ball game of gold and<br>this is remarkable because go is such a<br>complex game to be good to be a good go<br>player you have to rely on intuition<br>computers do not have intuitions that's<br>why previously people saw that computers<br>could never beat a good human player but<br>just two months ago a computer did beat<br>the best human player in the world in a<br>game of go so now it seems that<br>computers do have acquired some sort of<br>intuitions and the reason behind all<br>these amazing breakthroughs is machine<br>learning technology using this<br>technology we can feed a vast amount of<br>data into a computer and then the<br>computer can learn by the self the<br>hidden patterns in the data and make<br>predictions I think artificial<br>intelligence is going to have an impact<br>on knowledge workers in every sector no<br>one is safe but the extent of the impact<br>depends on the nature of that sector for<br>example if we are talking about<br>analyzing financial data like stock<br>prices computers can do that in fact<br>computers can do it better than human<br>beings and that's why the majority of<br>securities transactions in the world are<br>now done by computers not by humans but<br>for some professions like law it is more<br>difficult for computers to do because<br>legal reasoning requires common sense<br>and common sense is based on a wide<br>range of knowledge like history us music<br>science sports all of it computers do<br>not have that general knowledge so they<br>don't have a common sense but now<br>scientists are trying a number of ways<br>to solve this problem one of the ways is<br>to convert each word into a long series<br>of numbers in other words we are<br>translating the natural language into a<br>language which computers can understand<br>hopefully one day computers<br>and just go out and reach all sorts of<br>materials and deck in the common sense<br>we are not there yet but we are getting<br>there if computers become truly smart in<br>a sense thing they can do it they can<br>understand and they can reason then they<br>can do a lot of things from lawyers<br>perspective I can like computers traffic<br>contracts to deliver do due diligence or<br>even give me a summary of all the<br>relevant cases on particular topic<br>actually we can take this idea one step<br>further and let's imagine that a<br>computer with all the pieces and statues<br>and text books and then the computer<br>will become an expert in the field of<br>law in a sense the computer becomes your<br>bought a lawyer it can provide a legal<br>advice it can do legal reasoning and in<br>fact currently one of the problems with<br>our current legal system is that people<br>need legal advice but they cannot afford<br>it so maybe a robot come robot lawyer is<br>the solution and in the financial sector<br>accurate this is already happening<br>computers are already providing<br>investment advice and low cost of free<br>to read your investors once computers<br>can do things on their own and make<br>decisions and make decisions on their<br>own I think we then have to consider a<br>serious question that is how much<br>responsibility we can give to computers<br>in other words what are the things what<br>are the decisions a computer can make<br>and what are the decisions only a human<br>being can make I think it's quite safe<br>to say that we can allow computer to<br>drive a car or flight plan or even<br>perform medical operations but on the<br>other hand I think we should never allow<br>a computer to decide the fate of a human<br>being like whether the person should be<br>killed or sent to jail but there will be<br>some tricky questions like can we allow<br>a computer to decide whether to build a<br>new bridge or to the lower the interest<br>rate those are difficult questions and I<br>think we need to start thinking<br>seriously about them<br>artificial intelligence will transform<br>the job market in the next 10 or 20<br>years there's no question about that for<br>the legal profession we are facing two<br>types of questions one type is what are<br>the new laws or use we need to design or<br>create to cater for this new phenomena<br>and the other type of question is how<br>legal professions can use the new<br>technology to increase the quality of<br>legal services we can provide to our<br>clients but the AAR future can be a bit<br>scary but it's also very exciting to me<br>for the first time in human history<br>machines not only enhance our physical<br>power but also our mental power to think<br>and to reason the journey to advocate<br>intelligence will push the boundary<br>between machines and humans and lead us<br>to a better and deeper understanding of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
