Spock's of this world you find them<br>in institutions you don't find them of<br>them in running spaceships and in Star<br>Trek etc if you don't have access to<br>your emotions you're incapable of making<br>decisions regardless of what your<br>intellectual intelligences and so we we<br>have much clearer idea now that if you<br>don't know if you don't study the<br>emotional dimensions you really don't<br>have an appreciation of how<br>organizational behavior affects some<br>decision-making and behavior in work in<br>general that's why it's so popular now<br>well the person who popularized<br>emotional intelligence his name was<br>Daniel Goleman and Dan was the social<br>sciences writer for the New York Times<br>he decides to do a work on a new<br>technique is to he's heard about for<br>teaching primary school in the New<br>Hampshire area where he lives and when<br>he goes there he discovers that the new<br>technique is called emotional<br>intelligence he gets to know the people<br>who basically promulgating the idea Jack<br>may and Peter Sullivan he becomes<br>familiar with their work and then based<br>on that he then writes our emotional<br>intelligence<br>why EQ matters more than IQ the book<br>becomes a best-seller peers on the on<br>the cover of Time magazine you've<br>certainly made as if you're on the cover<br>of Time magazine businesses can't get<br>enough of it and especially as Goldman<br>makes a claim in his book that<br>researchers demonstrated that<br>intellectual intelligence accounts for<br>about 20% of your life successes it must<br>be<br>intelligence that accounts for the other<br>80% it makes a whole series of wild<br>claims like that through the book but<br>through that sort of mechanism the idea<br>absolutely takes off in business and<br>goes well beyond the scientific basis of<br>emotional intelligence emotional<br>intelligence is defined by um by Maya<br>and Celebi as as an ability it's an<br>intelligence and ability to recognize<br>emotions to incorporate the emotions in<br>your thinking processes to understand<br>what the emotions are about and<br>ultimately to manage emotions in<br>yourself the idea of emotional<br>intelligence is perfectly valid we've<br>shown now quite conclusively through the<br>research that's been done the serious<br>research that's been done on emotional<br>intelligence that it does make a<br>difference people who lack emotional<br>intelligence constantly make make errors<br>in dealing with people and even in their<br>in their judgemental decision-making<br>that can't be accounted for by the<br>intellectual intelligence so there's a<br>lot of misinformation about there and<br>unfortunately people continue to buy it<br>even today the message that I make is<br>that most intelligence is valid but do<br>take care that you're correct<br>and usually the scientific version not<br>the the popular versions we're learning<br>a lot now from the neurosciences we can<br>look into brains that were in ways that<br>were just undreamt of just a few years<br>ago so functional magnetic resonance<br>imaging putting people in in MRI<br>machines and asking them to solve<br>problems allows us to actually see<br>what's going on inside their brains<br>which part of the emotions are being<br>triggered for instance there's a guy at<br>Harvard University Joshua Greene who is<br>studying ethical decision-making and<br>showing that the parts of the brain that<br>are activated for ethical<br>decision-making are the same parts of<br>the brain that are associated with our<br>you know basic emotions we're learning<br>all of this new information there's a<br>little hats you can put on that our<br>electroencephalograph monitors and a<br>group of researchers<br>it's got people in meetings groups of<br>people in meetings literally looking<br>into their brain while they're<br>discussing and then synchronizing what<br>they're saying with their brainwaves<br>that they're recording and learning<br>basically what the inner thoughts are<br>will highly expressing their outer<br>thoughts and this is really really<br>revolutionizing the study of emotions<br>and already generating insights that we<br>that we had no idea about just a few<br>years ago I still go into organizations<br>if my colleagues do in our consulting<br>roles and we have senior managers<br>telling us you know in the organization<br>we expect employees to leave their<br>emotions at home there can be some ocean<br>as I like outside the opposite when they<br>come into the office we don't we don't<br>do emotions in this place it's really<br>important not only that our I insist on<br>it yeah yeah I absolutely insist no<br>emotion you get what I'm talking about<br>that's a little bit of a message in that<br>wonder that look the simple fact is that<br>emotions are they and people who are<br>trying to be unemotional get emotional<br>about it I've got a simple little<br>episode that I tell my students the most<br>irrational thought a human being can<br>have is to think that other humans are<br>rational we need to just convince<br>managers and consultants that you can't<br>really advise people on the assumption<br>that people are rational it's just a<br>recipe for disaster if you try to cancel<br>out the emotion emotional side you'll<br>simply get incorrect decision-making if<br>people are not accessing their emotions<br>that people do access their emotions but<br>if they're told not to access their<br>emotions and to make them make their<br>decisions in a cold calculated way it's<br>going to lead them into bad<br>decision-making the another laureate<br>Daniel Kahneman wrote a book called<br>thinking fast thinking slow where he<br>talks about in stock market<br>decision-making if you try to rely<br>purely on the the rational computer<br>generated decisions you will inevitably<br>go down<br>the gurgler um it's been demonstrated<br>over and over again Warren Buffett<br>states have done in the same terms he<br>says you can't make financial decisions<br>without understanding the the emotional<br>underpinnings of that and people who try<br>to put the emotion to one side they're<br>not going to be effective so one of the<br>the ways from a practical perspective<br>that managers can can approach this is<br>by building a emotionally healthy<br>organization it's an idea that's been<br>with us for for a while but basically<br>it's something that goes across all<br>levels of the organization starts in the<br>in the c-suite but goes right down to<br>the to the work face one of the secrets<br>of that of that process of course is to<br>look at the the basics of emotional<br>intelligence get people to understand<br>that they can accept their emotions that<br>they can recognize their emotions what<br>do emotions mean and is it possible to<br>manage emotions in yourself and in other<br>people given the right circumstances<br>people can do that but the first of all<br>requires really an acceptance and<br>acknowledgement that emotions are not be</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
