Kerr, Director of the University of Auckland Business Schoolâ€™s Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, discusses the journey from corporate life to business independence.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when I wrote my two books and before I<br>started my business I interviewed over a<br>hundred woman about why they left their<br>jobs to start their own business and I<br>talked to them about their journey and<br>what I discovered through talking to all<br>of these woman is that there was a<br>really strong pattern that emerged from<br>all of them and essentially it starts<br>like this a woman starts to feel unhappy<br>and who work and typically from my<br>research I found out that she feels<br>disenfranchised by the culture she feels<br>that the cultures toxic that she's not<br>getting heard decision makings poor<br>leadership spore and basically she<br>starts to get this feeling of unease in<br>her workplace in overtime this leads<br>into a higher feeling of frustration and<br>dissatisfaction and she starts to think<br>there's got to be more to life than this<br>and then she starts to move on to say<br>I'm worth more than this and then<br>typically when thus the satisfaction<br>starts to grow a life event has happened<br>in their lives so either they get very<br>sick their partner gets ill or dies<br>their parent dies they get divorced or<br>they have a birthday which interestingly<br>is typically 40 or they might have a<br>child and so one of these life event<br>then conspires them to change their<br>perspective and then they start to look<br>at their world and their work quite<br>differently and that's when this<br>dissatisfaction intensifies and the<br>journey to leave speeds up they then<br>start to look at options and one option<br>is they just get a new job but then they<br>start to think that they want more<br>control and more freedom and flexibility<br>over their lives and that's when they<br>start to think about starting their own<br>business the study that I did before I<br>started my business corporate crossovers<br>was based on the quantitative piece of<br>research from 300 corporate crossovers<br>in the US end of the UK and there are<br>probably three astonishing results from<br>there<br>the first one was that sixty-eight<br>percent of these women make less and<br>their own business than they did in the<br>last job and of that most of them were<br>very unhappy with that number yet the<br>second astonishing result was that they<br>all said that they would not return to<br>their work the traditional work because<br>they loved the freedom the flexibility<br>and the control that they had and in the<br>third fascinating result was only one<br>percent of this woman cited the glass<br>ceiling for the reason that they left<br>corporate and then what I took that to<br>mean as it is the glass ceiling and math<br>and the key reason they decided to leave<br>their jobs was because it had enough of<br>the culture and they wanted to work in a<br>way that really worked for them when you<br>leave your job to start your own<br>business it's a huge transition and in<br>life there are many transitions that we<br>have and probably the most significant<br>transition that we experience as a human<br>is the death of someone close to us and<br>Elizabeth kubler-ross who is the author<br>of a book called on Greece and dying<br>created this fantastic model called the<br>five stages of grief and through the<br>interviews I've done and the work I done<br>of my clients I started to see that<br>there was a lot of similarities and<br>their transition with the stages of<br>grief and when I thought about it some<br>more I could see that what they were<br>grieving was in fact the loss of their<br>old life so then I devised based on the<br>kubler-ross model a model for the<br>corporate crossover transition and there<br>are seven stages to it and very simply<br>the first stage is anticipation you<br>leave your job when you're excited and<br>you think we'll how their futures in<br>front of me and I've got liberation and<br>I'm going to create my own path and then<br>after that the reality sets in because<br>they don't have to get up and go to work<br>anymore they might not get out of your<br>pajamas before noon but with this they<br>start to realize that there's a big<br>to-do list that they have to complete to<br>start your own business and there's no<br>money coming in so that's a first step<br>of reality<br>then they move into shock and the shock<br>is that they start to feel very isolated<br>because they may not have work mates<br>they've got none of that office banter<br>that we all need to feel socialized and<br>the shockers that they realize that<br>their success is completely up to them<br>so when that realities kicks in some<br>more they then move into a slump and<br>literary they lose energy they losing<br>motivation and they start to think is<br>this it and then they start to think<br>should I get real and get a job or do I<br>really push this along and make it work<br>so that's a danger period for these<br>corporate crossovers to skip back and<br>get a job but when they get through that<br>they then move into the next stage which<br>is called adjustment and at this phase<br>they've started to get a rhythm and a<br>routine to their life that works they've<br>started to create a network around<br>themselves that supports them and<br>understands what they're going through<br>and then they also have got some ones<br>they've started getting some money<br>coming in so once they've gone through<br>adjustment they then move into momentum<br>and momentum is the phase or they start<br>to understand what this is all about<br>they've got used to the peaks and the<br>troughs of the income because it's<br>always a bit like this they've realized<br>that they can talk about themselves<br>confidently and their identity is much<br>closer aligned with what they're doing<br>now and importantly here they start to<br>view themselves as a success because<br>they're no longer judging themselves as<br>a success based on what they used to do<br>and that success criteria they've<br>transitioned their whole identity<br>success criteria to what they are now<br>and then lastly they get through it all<br>and they're completely committed and<br>then they say I could never imagine<br>going back to what I used to do i<br>maligned my values are aligned I love<br>the work I do I love who I work with and<br>I accept the money for what it is what<br>can make that journey less painful and<br>shallower and much<br>easier I've really distilled into three<br>things and the first thing is to have a<br>network and a network comprised of<br>people who are also running their own<br>businesses because they will get what<br>you're going through unlike your friends<br>and your unlike your family they'll also<br>be your cheerleaders because running<br>your own business is like the most<br>intense personal development course you<br>will ever do so you need people on your<br>side to help you through that then the<br>second thing that you need to get<br>through this is a really clear strong<br>compelling vision of what you're<br>creating because when you can really<br>picture what it is that you're going to<br>bring to the world and you feel<br>motivated and passionate about it then<br>that's what's going to feel you through<br>that journey and then the third thing is<br>a really strong reason why you're doing<br>what you're doing because to have that<br>passion and the motivation and the<br>tenacity and the resilience that you<br>need to build a business you have to<br>feel it really in your heart so when I<br>work with women before about starting<br>their own business we talk about<br>building a network been very clear about<br>your vision but absolutely tapping into<br>that deep reason why you're about to do</p></main><footer
