style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I had a lovely day yesterday when my<br>wife and I are here we own a small batch<br>in Golden Bay when we drive to the<br>Nelson Airport to come to Auckland we go<br>through the small town of motueka and in<br>moto a Kolkata<br>I discovered accidentally four or five<br>years ago and it's called waa Coppins<br>and they are a handful of people and yet<br>they are the best company on earth at<br>making sea anchors and not sea anchors<br>which they do for parasailing and so on<br>but they just landed a big contract with<br>the government of Norway suppose you're<br>out at an oil platform in the messy<br>North Sea and a tanker goes bust the<br>engine goes bust it's drifting towards<br>Shore we want to stop it from drifting<br>you do that with a monster sea anchor<br>this little technical company in tiny<br>motueka beat out seven international<br>giants has got a multi-million dollar<br>contract with the government of Norway<br>to provide these things I believe that<br>that's or it's not software and it's not<br>biotechnology but it is seriously<br>sophisticated technological work and I<br>think you can do that on a global basis<br>they are part of the global community<br>they compete against global companies<br>they land contracts with our United<br>States Navy and so on and so being a<br>global player and part of the global<br>scene is not limited to big companies in<br>any way shape or form it is as available<br>to Kiwis as it is effectively to<br>Americans and it's about the notion of<br>specialness and being very very good at<br>something and it's it's just it is not<br>that's not in short supply I mean where<br>did the ideas come from at some level<br>they were textile company I believe it<br>was started in 1895 so they've known<br>something about fabrics<br>for well over a hundred years it's a<br>long way from a textile in 1895 to to a<br>sea anchor in the middle of the North<br>Sea that's saving environmental damage<br>on the Norwegian coast but but you know<br>as I say though those are the places<br>that excite me there is Kiwi available<br>as they are American available in the<br>United States I live in Vermont which is<br>the fiftieth most populated state in the<br>United States which means we're right at<br>the bottom of the heap I have I spent 35<br>years in Silicon Valley but I've now<br>spent 25 years in Vermont and I am<br>surrounded primarily by dairy farmers<br>and in my experience and I don't want to<br>romanticize things in New Zealand or at<br>home there could not be a craftier or<br>more inventive set of people in the<br>world than the small farmer there are<br>million reasons that small farmers don't<br>make out any money and there are million<br>reasons that their kids leave and so on<br>and so forth but the notion of clever<br>inventive people is from that sort of<br>background I mean I know that's not<br>Auckland but it is available to the -<br>the average Kiwi was there serendipity<br>in this or the serendipity and<br>everything people need to spark off of<br>other people I'm here you know today<br>under the auspices of the of the<br>Auckland Business School and creating<br>centers physical centres where people<br>with ideas hang out with other people<br>with ideas and get support from the<br>business community for example as<br>mentors that's great though I would<br>argue back to my small business bias<br>that the best mentor for someone doing a<br>startup is not somebody who's a middle<br>manager at a big company but it's<br>somebody in a small company that may be<br>in a totally unrelated industry that's<br>gone through the process of starting a<br>business growing a business finding<br>finance not bank finance but some<br>finance and of course today<br>you have all the magical things such as<br>crowdsourcing where you know somebody in<br>moto acres should they be interested<br>with a cool idea that they can present<br>in a cool way on the Internet could wake<br>up tomorrow morning with three hundred<br>thousand dollars in their pocket I think<br>you could teach entrepreneurship to<br>seven year olds a lot better than you<br>could teach it to business students at<br>either the Auckland business school or<br>at Mile my school which was the Stanford<br>Business School<br>I mean entrepreneurial stuff in that<br>let's call it lower case e<br>entrepreneurial which is organizing and<br>putting on yeah putting on plays at the<br>age of ten putting together a little<br>newspapers online newspapers I mean one<br>of my and I did get involved in this a<br>little bit in New Zealand then a little<br>bit at home I would like to think and<br>I'm not being critical here because I<br>don't know but people tell me and I'm<br>not wrong I would like to think that the<br>most entrepreneurial enthusiastic<br>energetic people were going into<br>education and teaching six year olds and<br>seven year olds and I'm not saying that<br>all American school teachers are tired<br>and old they are not but it's it's just<br>if it's an if it's the national<br>requirement which in the age of new<br>technology I think it is I mean I'm just<br>I'll pound the table I want the very<br>best the very brightest the most<br>energetic in the most entrepreneurial<br>and the most enthusiastic please don't<br>give me a career but give me five years<br>of teaching the seven year olds and the<br>eight year olds and that's where you<br>could teach entrepreneurship and I will<br>almost guarantee you that there's a<br>woman by the name of Jane McGonigal who<br>wrote a lovely book called reality is<br>broken and she said that you know that<br>relative the issue of failure the new<br>generation of kids who've played video<br>games understand failure the only way<br>you get from level 5 to level 6 on a<br>video game is to make as many mistakes<br>and that's not the right term<br>as many mistakes as rapidly as you can<br>so yeah unlike when I was taught<br>spelling and you got your hands wrapped<br>if you misspelled a word these kids<br>spend their life failing they spend<br>their life failing and and there was a<br>wonderful other thing she said which is<br>so true and I've observed it and so on<br>kids don't play video games to win they<br>play video games for mastery the Mehcad<br>from level three to level 4 to level 5<br>to level 6 to level 7 they're not<br>tallying wins and losses<br>they're just chalking up those losses<br>and trying to get the level 7 before<br>their buddy does or or what-have-you so<br>at some level I think our teachers have<br>our young teachers in the early years<br>have wonderful clay and let's support<br>that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
