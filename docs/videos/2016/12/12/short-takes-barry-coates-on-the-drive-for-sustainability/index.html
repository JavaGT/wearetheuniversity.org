He discusses why business is at a turning point on sustainability.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>business is at a real turning point on<br>sustainability globally the climate<br>change talks and Paris and the new<br>agreement on climate change set a<br>long-term direction it's been made it<br>abundantly clear that there is a<br>transition away from fossil fuels the<br>business agenda is really responding to<br>this globally and we've seen companies<br>like Unilever and Nestle and others<br>really stepping up to this global agenda<br>plus newcomers like Tesla and others<br>that are disrupting markets in New<br>Zealand I think we're seeing a<br>renaissance eye on sustainability after<br>it went frankly dormant for some time<br>and recently in New Zealand announcer<br>sustainability policy to an absolutely<br>packed house and shed tin and in<br>Auckland with 450 business leaders and<br>that really felt like a turning point<br>for New Zealand business to logic for<br>business on sustainability is often been<br>presented that it's a moral argument it<br>is that business needs to take its<br>responsibilities towards others in<br>society but it's also an economic<br>argument I mean if you look at the<br>notions of a circular economy of waste<br>minimization businesses have some real<br>advantage in terms of saving themselves<br>money through energy efficiency and good<br>practice in their business with regard<br>to minimizing waste you've also got a<br>logic to say that businesses will do<br>well if they engage their customers<br>about the the practices of<br>sustainability so so companies like zeod<br>energy for example have a very strong<br>message to their customers about the way<br>they incorporate sustainability into<br>their business and and I guess thirdly<br>it's important to investors and it's<br>important to the value of a company<br>shareholder value is increasingly about<br>corporate reputation brand and all of<br>the other things that used to be called<br>we'll in an accounting sense and they<br>that can account for over two thirds of<br>company value often up to ninety percent<br>so companies need to manage their<br>reputation well to manager badly as many<br>companies have found is extremely<br>dangerous and and has led to precipitous<br>declines and shareholder value one of<br>the most important drivers is of course<br>the perception of customers and the<br>practice of customers and and you know<br>comma brunton the polling agency did<br>research they said that eighty-eight<br>percent of consumers care about<br>sustainability and other half will pay<br>more for sustainable practices and you<br>know companies that are positioning<br>themselves in sustainable sustainability<br>will do well because on the shelf they<br>get the preference from from consumers<br>if they have a credible story that's<br>really important the story has to be<br>credible and ideally it has to be backed<br>up by independent and objective<br>certification but also then there is a<br>certain group of customers that are<br>prepared to pay higher prices for goods<br>that are labeled sustainable and you<br>only have to look at organics and<br>free-range and other product categories<br>to see that that plays out every day in<br>our retail stores there's been<br>interesting research undertaken by<br>waikato management school to look at<br>tracking over time what happens in<br>business perception on corporate social<br>responsibility and and what's<br>increasingly evidence is that businesses<br>are expecting the government to step up<br>to the challenge of sustainability we've<br>come from a period where frankly the<br>government has done little in order to<br>to set the parameters that would reward<br>the good players on sustainability and<br>provide penalty for those who are<br>essentially pollutant so according to<br>the polluter pays principle all<br>governments have signed up to you would<br>expect that that the wood<br>be a price on pollution and and New<br>Zealand is frankly one of the leg arts<br>within the OECD on setting those<br>environmental taxes or environmental<br>subsidies in order to change the price<br>signals I think there's increasing<br>pressure firstly on government to do<br>more from business and it would be good<br>if more businesses spoke up to say that<br>but also we see a lot of businesses who<br>say we're not going to wait for<br>government we need to do this price<br>signals will happen over time<br>particularly on issues like climate<br>change and we're going to go ahead and<br>make the investments and change our<br>practices in order to do that good for<br>customers good for business and and it<br>will give us many cases either a first<br>mover advantage or in fact a way to be<br>able to comply with our supply chain<br>requirements which were increasingly<br>onerous around sustainability my role<br>has been to establish a sustainability<br>program at the University of Auckland<br>business school we've looked around what<br>other universities are doing<br>internationally and and it's very<br>interesting leading universities are a<br>long way down the road on this and had<br>done some some fabulous and exciting<br>things there the usual cast of<br>characters Harvard Yale which is my alma<br>mater and and Oxford Cambridge etc one<br>of the ones I love is MIT and MIT has<br>not only an overall strategy for the<br>University on sustainability but the<br>business school leads in terms of of<br>sustainability teaching and research and<br>they have a very close link with<br>innovation and entrepreneurship and<br>sustainability so this is I think an<br>area where an innovative practice in<br>universities can can really help provide<br>the next generation of business leaders<br>who are well-versed in sustainability<br>but also see a rapidly evolving future<br>and are able to position the companies<br>that they work for into into their<br>future I guess the other the other<br>interesting thing from from looking<br>across universities is<br>few of the universities are playing what<br>what I would call a convening role so<br>they're bringing different stakeholders<br>together around sustainability issues<br>often people who don't necessarily agree<br>with each other or talk with each other<br>and I think that's a really important<br>role for universities and and something<br>certainly that we're looking at at the<br>University of Auckland and and we aim to<br>be amongst the leading universities are<br>on the issues of sustainability one of<br>the key lessons and ways forward for<br>businesses to is to look for the<br>fundamentals of the business and end in<br>a way tied into person strategy many<br>many companies regard sustainability as<br>a bit of an add-on so it's something<br>that we do in order to keep our<br>customers happy actually the most<br>innovative approaches our companies are<br>using is to build sustainability into<br>their core strategy and it's very much<br>around the concept of shared value where<br>you look at the the fundamentals of the<br>business of competitive drivers of the<br>business and you say how can we build in<br>sustainability in a way that is central<br>to our tour bus and so instead of using<br>corporate social responsibility as a way<br>for example to give a bit of money to<br>charity actually what you're trying to<br>do is you're trying to change your<br>business strategy so that sustainability<br>is at the heart and that's a kind of<br>approach which is driving the strategies<br>of many companies internationally and I<br>guess Unilever as a classic example food<br>companies are really leading the charge<br>on on this in many ways and it's also<br>evident and sectors where there is<br>disruptive technology that is opening up<br>spaces for business to reshape their<br>markets and reshape their purpose as<br>companies as the Silicon Valley<br>entrepreneurs pretty teal said you know<br>the most successful companies never<br>established to make money they<br>established to change the world and when<br>companies have a driver of<br>sustainability they find value in ways</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
