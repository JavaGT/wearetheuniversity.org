experience of steering AIA through the Global Financial Crisis, which resulted in one of the largest IPOs in corporate history.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when Arg collapsed was like being at<br>ground zero of the global financial<br>crisis so you had this macroeconomics<br>colliding with micro policy from<br>regulators colliding with I guess<br>incompetence and short-termism<br>at the parent company and so you woke up<br>in the morning and you have a situation<br>where you didn't know whether the<br>company was going to survive to the end<br>of the day he didn't know whether the US<br>government was going to bail it out and<br>they did to the tune of a hundred and<br>eighty billion u.s. dollars and here we<br>are the may that major overseas<br>subsidiary AIA and you're waking up in<br>the morning and there's queues outside<br>every branch going around ten blocks<br>city blocks you on the front page of<br>every newspaper in the region and at<br>that stage you realize you have an issue<br>well there was this huge pen asian-based<br>insurance giant it had around about 25<br>million customers was also incredibly<br>linked in to all the economies at that<br>stage I think we are owned about 43<br>percent the long end of the thai bond<br>market so if our gone down the<br>repercussions were enormous<br>we had 300,000 staff and agents we had<br>many many billions of dollars of debt<br>with the with the government's you had<br>about 20 I think about saying 24 25<br>million customers if the company had<br>collapsed all of that went down so it<br>focuses your mind about what to do it<br>focuses and said and you say to yourself<br>you're not there for yourself you're not<br>there for the company you there for all<br>those people in those millions of<br>customers and the impact on economies<br>and you say old job is to fix it so the<br>stakes we were paying with it was not a<br>poker game mistakes were you a plane<br>with those people's lives and Families<br>economies and that's what we were try<br>and focus on fixing when you come into<br>across a situation like that there's no<br>academic book that's ever been written<br>so there's no book we could turn to him<br>saying well here's the beginner's guide<br>to to fixing this global economic crisis<br>and saving the company when your parent<br>just went bankrupt it's like what all of<br>a sudden would become a business orphan<br>and we had to look at herself so<br>basically we got my best people together<br>we took them off their entire jobs and<br>says said to them this is what you need<br>to do we we basically drew up a list of<br>key work streams and then we just got<br>better at defining it day by day we met<br>three times a day with the crisis team<br>was really a war room and we and my team<br>didn't go home for weeks in that case I<br>literally didn't go home for 14 days I<br>didn't have a day off for eight and a<br>half months and neither did the team and<br>we had this extraordinary bunch of<br>people that we'll together to get the<br>outcome now history I think is a fairly<br>good judge what happened and they ended<br>up being at that stage the biggest IPO<br>in global corporate history and that IPO<br>was the single biggest event the saved<br>AIG and it was a remarkable events in<br>that company's history and and now it's<br>running as this huge and highly<br>successful independent organization so<br>what we did we set up a number of work<br>streams there was about 12 and they<br>covered all sorts of things so one of<br>them was just a financial and capital<br>position if we couldn't secure that then<br>the company could have been a problem<br>the second biggest one was actually the<br>regulators how do we get the regulators<br>and the governments around Asia on our<br>side so that they would help us and<br>protect us and support us we needed rule<br>changes we needed them to ring-fence the<br>companies sort of from outside<br>influences so that was really important<br>communication was a big one<br>communication with our policyholders<br>with our staff with the media and<br>getting the comms right in that sort of<br>crisis if you get the comms right it can<br>take all wrong it can take all your time<br>so that was a<br>big problem the people what do you do if<br>your people every competitor was<br>circling like a bunch of sharks who<br>could smell blood and we're trying to<br>take alert key people what do you do<br>with the people remember there's no<br>books written on it and anything can<br>blow you off course there's there's a<br>British politician Prime Minister Harold<br>Macmillan a thing is back in the 50s and<br>when someone asked him what could blow<br>us blow him off course he said events<br>dear boy events and this is the same<br>thing events with happening so fast it<br>could blow you off course and so any<br>plan that you'd done before the crisis<br>you could just throw it out in the<br>window I mean there's that other great<br>intellectual and great global statesman<br>by the name of Mike Tyson he said once<br>that he said everyone has a plan to beat<br>me until I punch them in the mouth and<br>as a CEO and a crisis you get punched in<br>that mitt in your metaphorical mouth<br>continually and the question is how do<br>you deal with it when there's no plans<br>now there's a few key rule of thumbs<br>here of course that I was always<br>consider when you're in a real crisis<br>situation consensus and crisis are two<br>words that just don't go together and it<br>doesn't matter what leadership style you<br>have or what approach you have to be<br>absolutely decisive when everyone around<br>you would otherwise panic and then<br>crisis people want their clarity so they<br>want leaders or leader that is<br>absolutely certain and confident in<br>their direction even if you get it wrong<br>in a crisis being certain and providing<br>clarity and stability that's you more<br>important but if you get it wrong you'll<br>find out soon enough<br>second it's about separation separate<br>they run the business stuff away from<br>the crisis and have your best people<br>focused 100% on the crisis and break<br>them up and take them out of their day<br>jobs thirdly put things in boxes put<br>give yourself deadlines that you must<br>meet at that time fourthly and always be<br>prepared before the crisis you'll never<br>be able to predict what crisis going to<br>happen<br>but both the relationships before both<br>the relationships of the government's<br>and the regulator's and your key people<br>long before because if you already have<br>the relationship then they will help you<br>when you really need it for example<br>regulators Malaysia a woman I have great<br>respect for a woman called governor<br>jetty who was the head of the bank<br>pagará I built a relationship with her<br>over years and she's a woman with a<br>formidable intellect and and really a<br>great leader in Malaysia's history I<br>rang her up the day after the crisis<br>started and I said I needed some money<br>out of their business and she was always<br>very formal and she said mr. Wilson I'm<br>going to do this for one reason and I<br>said what reasons that Governor City she<br>said only because I trust you when you<br>an a when you in a crisis situation and<br>it doesn't matter whether this is a<br>business or a sports body or governance<br>scenario the only rules that you judge<br>it by the value set your God and we used<br>to talk regularly in our business and<br>with our people in this crisis it would<br>say how will history judge us what will<br>this decisions the shareholders the<br>staff the regulators what will they say<br>in one year or two years and five years<br>about how we handle this in one stage we<br>were three weeks away from IPO remember<br>this is this mess of IPO of this pan<br>Asian giant with three weeks away from<br>that and the AIG Board decided they were<br>going to sell it to Prudential which is<br>another large UK organization and the<br>Chinese said it was like the snake<br>trying to swallow the elephant and it<br>was a deal that financee just could not<br>work there's no way it would have worked<br>and I think they would have just<br>collapsed under the debt load so what<br>are you doing that sort of situation<br>do you take the personal financial<br>benefits that would have come with that<br>transaction or do you make the decision<br>you think's going to last long term and<br>my management team and I chose that<br>second option and we would have all been<br>paying an extraordinary amount of money<br>to complete their deal but it was the<br>wrong deal that was the wrong outcome<br>and it's those sort of decisions and<br>those key moments that<br>build teams or break teams and and get<br>you judged either as being successful in<br>a turnaround or not because at the end<br>of the day it comes back to that to your<br>value set it's the same with the Viva<br>Viva a 320 year old organization that's<br>this iconic British organization that<br>did some stupid things are financially<br>and strategically but when you have a<br>look through and as you do a turn around<br>there and there's a dirty land there<br>with my team it all comes back to the<br>values and I'm not talking about basic<br>values like honesty integrity you've got<br>to have those anyway it comes down to<br>how you want to run the business do you<br>want to run the short term or long term<br>and one of the most important values we<br>have is it is something I stole from the<br>All Blacks and that is a value that we<br>call create legacy we want to be good<br>ancestors we want to think long term we<br>I know I'm only a temporary guardian and<br>a 320 year old organization their<br>organization was built by people long<br>before me and you just want to leave in<br>a better place you want those decisions<br>to be those sort of long-term decisions<br>and you just gotta do it in a way<br>without hubris and arrogance and<br>unfortunately there's way too much of<br>that in the global corporate world at<br>the moment how do you prepare yourself<br>for a crisis in fact there are a number<br>of things you can do you can never write<br>a plan that's good enough for crisis<br>that doesn't exist it's going to be<br>thrown out but what you can do is get<br>the depth of people that are used to<br>working under pressure you can get a<br>value set that you use is the foundation<br>for decisions so DeVivo value setters<br>create legacy which just means be a good<br>ancestor care more which basically means<br>just do the right thing<br>kill complexity so you always want to<br>simplify the organization down and the<br>last one we call as never list which<br>means never be happy with the status quo<br>some people think it means you don't get<br>any sleep and there was a bit of that<br>too but it's never be happy with the<br>status quo always think your very best<br>isn't quite good enough for the customer<br>and if you put those values in place and<br>strong culture if you have a strong<br>project management or change management<br>methodology then you'll cope of<br>fights us much better because you can<br>use that infrastructure you have in<br>place understanding of course that the<br>decisions you'll make will never have<br>been done before when you're going<br>through a crisis you're always thinking<br>to yourself am I making the right<br>decision am I good enough you know<br>everyone's following me on this decision<br>is that the right one and every leader<br>in a crisis will doubt themself but if<br>you show that during the crisis then</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
