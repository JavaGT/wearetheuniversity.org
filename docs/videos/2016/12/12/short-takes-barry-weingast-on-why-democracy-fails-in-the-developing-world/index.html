to take root in developing countries.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>violence I think is the single biggest<br>missing feature in economics economics<br>of development economists dominate the<br>thinking about economic development and<br>rightly so they have the best theories<br>of the way the world works the way<br>market works and yet I feel that they<br>miss the margin of violence and because<br>of that they don't understand the nature<br>of the development problem and we can<br>quantify this by thinking about the<br>incidence of violence and ask how<br>frequent is violence in the developing<br>world and the way to ask the question or<br>the way we ask the question has to do<br>with how frequent our violent regime<br>changes take over the government how<br>frequent is that and it turns out it's<br>remarkably a frequent that is in the<br>developing world it's about once every<br>seven years it's very different in the<br>developed world because in the developed<br>world it turns out it's once every sixty<br>years so developed countries face much<br>less of a problem of violence and<br>moreover we argue that while all<br>countries have to solve the problem with<br>violence that the developed countries do<br>so in a very different way than the<br>developing countries so developed<br>countries solve the problem through<br>economic integration so economic<br>integration lowers violence because if<br>you and I are on potential sites that<br>might be a political dividing line that<br>could possibly lead to violence if you<br>and I are economically integrated so<br>that we depend on one another then this<br>raises the cost to us of fighting so one<br>of the key features of developing<br>economies is what we call the natural<br>state that is because of the possibility<br>of violence developing countries<br>organize themselves in a way that<br>mitigates the problem of violence they<br>don't completely solve it but they<br>mitigate it and by that we mean that<br>they are rent creation societies meaning<br>that they give privileges to various<br>groups powerful groups and individuals<br>as a means of giving them incentives to<br>cooperate and not to fight so the basic<br>idea is is that groups that have the<br>power to to use violence have to be seen<br>themselves as better<br>by playing by playing cooperative<br>strategy rather than rather than<br>fighting and so the way natural states<br>do that is by giving them various forms<br>of privileges monopolies special<br>preferences of preferential tariffs that<br>cut off competition from imports they<br>may get a monopoly on the local cement<br>factory or the local beer factory so<br>they are the only ones that produce beer<br>in a particular area and the key is is<br>that this this creates these these<br>barriers to market forces create rents<br>that give them something to lose if they<br>exercise violence economists don't see<br>the same mechanism they see that the<br>problem is one of largely economic<br>intervention that is the government it<br>creates policies that prevent markets<br>from workings and as a consequence they<br>suggest that the road to reform that is<br>the way to fix this is to dismantle the<br>controls over the over the market and<br>let the market make its magic the<br>problem that they miss however is the<br>problem of violence that if the nature<br>of these controls on markets are in fact<br>designed to solve the problem of<br>violence then dismantling these policies<br>did not produce economic reform in<br>markets instead they threaten the they<br>threaten violence and so as a<br>consequence these reforms even 50 years<br>worth of these reforms tend not to have<br>very much of a success another issue<br>we're thinking about is violence in the<br>third world it's quite prevalent the<br>Middle East for example is far more<br>violent in the last five to ten years<br>than it had been in the previous decades<br>and the question is is there a way of<br>mitigating this violence and I think<br>there's multiple ways of thinking about<br>it the dominant way tends to think in<br>terms of oh well what we need to do is<br>create democracies that is looking at<br>these countries as if they're our whole<br>state and an a United population whereas<br>they tend not to be United populations<br>there are many different<br>differences sometimes religion sometimes<br>sectarian sometimes it's the nature of<br>Geographic differences and I think one<br>way to think about the problem that<br>comes from this perspective I've been<br>suggesting has to do with the nature of<br>stabilizing violence that if violence is<br>a factor a regular factor an endemic<br>factor of these countries then we have<br>to take that into account so you can<br>look at the failures of the United<br>States for example in in Iraq from this<br>standpoint the first thing the Americans<br>wanted to do was create a market society<br>with democracy and so elections very<br>quickly were organized without in in the<br>long term we now know without great<br>success and part of the problem I think<br>is the absence of thinking about the<br>problem of the nature of the three<br>different groups of the Sunnis the<br>Shia's and the and the Kurds in terms of<br>different groups that have each of which<br>have various forms of violence potential<br>and trying to solve the nature of the<br>problems that they have together so that<br>they have incentives to cooperate as<br>groups rather than trying to form a<br>modern democracy so one of the things<br>that the United States might have done<br>very differently in 2003 4 &amp; 5 that is<br>the very early stages of reform is<br>create a system whereby the rents from<br>the oil are divided among the three<br>groups and and where the continual<br>maintenance of the rents for each group<br>depends upon cooperating in peace so<br>that there was some mechanism to stop<br>the flow of rents if there were violence<br>and thereby give them incentives to<br>cooperate and and form institutions of<br>their own for cooperation rather you<br>know that rather than go straight to a<br>modern democracy taking into account the<br>problem of violence I think gives us a<br>new way of thinking about the problem of<br>development and as a consequence I think<br>that there are many new insights that<br>may allow us if not to solve the problem<br>of development at least to mitigate the<br>problem of violence and by mitigating<br>problem of violence you lower the effect<br>of the risk of violence and hence make<br>economic activity much more profitable<br>whereas in the last 50 years the<br>dominant perspective of development<br>which has dominated the nature of though<br>the aid aid community say the u.s.<br>United States Agency for Economic<br>Development or International Development<br>the USAID the World Bank the IMF the<br>European Bank for Reconstruction and<br>Development all of these have used the<br>standard approach to economics and have<br>not thought seriously about the nature<br>of violence and I think that this has<br>produced too few success rate stories<br>and I think part of the problem is<br>violence and so I think that there's a<br>great promise in thinking more seriously<br>about violence because it holds the<br>problem of the promise of alternative</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
