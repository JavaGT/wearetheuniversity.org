unexpected.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the 21st century has been fraught with<br>concerns about safety from the<br>micro-level<br>where we look at fraud and credit fraud<br>and theft for example through to the<br>macro level where we look at the<br>terrorist threat the eat at a day as you<br>hear is that the nature of the terrorist<br>threat keeps changing so it's going from<br>organized groups as well as the lone<br>wolf and the nature of what these<br>different groups are targeting whether<br>it's cyber whether it's aircraft whether<br>it's open places and spaces such as soft<br>targets stadiums post card targets the<br>nature of it is constantly morphing and<br>changing and this means that for<br>organizations extreme events ages from a<br>terrorist attack exposes them to high<br>levels of risk and uncertainty which can<br>stretch them to and beyond their limits<br>and so the difficulty is when we look in<br>the context of New Zealand that although<br>these extreme events are probably random<br>and they're improbable that they do<br>actually occur and we need to be<br>prepared and as the country without a<br>history of a lot of threats but the<br>nature of the global threats now and in<br>the way it's morphing and changing as<br>such that we need to be prepared and<br>working together as much as possible so<br>that there is a very quick business<br>recovery the implications for society<br>are that your critical national<br>infrastructure can easily be exposed to<br>extreme events for example if your<br>critical national infrastructure like<br>communications your food supply chains<br>your water and utility companies private<br>sector owned what are they done to<br>prepare themselves in the event of an<br>extreme event so for example in the UK<br>80% of the critical national<br>infrastructure is private sector owned<br>and often foreign owned so to what<br>extent are they working with local<br>government authorities central<br>government so this public-private<br>partnership to prepare for extreme<br>events which means that there is a quick<br>recovery and we're back to business as<br>usual as soon as possible from my<br>extensive research in consulting with<br>the British government in British and<br>PLC what we have found is that there is<br>a very a great<br>creation and degree of preparedness<br>across sector and across regions in the<br>UK and partly that is to do with the<br>fact that some organizations have been<br>more exposed to previous disasters and<br>therefore they have a lot of experience<br>that had their resilience tested and<br>they're able to use that knowledge to<br>inform their current practice and also<br>other organizations and their supply<br>chain but it does vary a lot in<br>organisations in terms of the structure<br>where does the business can continuity<br>manager set to do their head board<br>representation how much influence do<br>they have over decisions about finance<br>and what to invest in terms of<br>preventing or being prepared for any<br>kind of disaster the degree of<br>regulation so airlines and banks are in<br>highly regulated sectors although many<br>of them were coming to us asking for<br>advice to learn from other sectors<br>because I didn't want to just have the<br>same knowledge flowing around the same<br>ideas they wanted best practice from<br>other sectors but regulations certainly<br>sets a standard a minimum of compliance<br>and auditing and also the culture of the<br>organization some are very ordered and<br>compliance driven where others see<br>resilience as part of their whole<br>organizational culture because they want<br>to be able to be resilient to any kind<br>of threat not just the one that perhaps<br>just experienced which might have been<br>flooding they want to be able to be<br>prepared for a pandemic terrorist attack<br>a flood or whatever it may be and<br>therefore they want resilient<br>capabilities right across the<br>organizational culture some examples of<br>this would be in the airline industry<br>catering an onboard catering has always<br>been known to be a point of<br>vulnerability for Airlines because the<br>food could be poisoned or a bomb could<br>be put in the the food delivery units so<br>some organizations have gone so far to<br>mitigate that risk by actually not<br>having catering on board at all or<br>having sandwiches or different kinds of<br>on board service certainly the low-cost<br>airlines have gone that way they also<br>outsource their security checking and<br>get the airports to do it for them but<br>when we look at the differences to<br>utility companies there was a famous<br>case of seven treant in the UK which had<br>did not deal very well with the flooding<br>and in 2007 and there was the Pitt<br>review and what happened there is like<br>many organization is still a<br>expectation that government is going to<br>step in and resolve the problem at the<br>point of the crisis and then probably<br>help the organization through the crisis<br>but actually the UK government like many<br>governments in the world with the nature<br>of extreme events want the private<br>sector organisations to be prepared and<br>managed themselves through these crisis<br>because the unintended consequences<br>certainly in the UK flooding example was<br>that generators got flooded which<br>affected local hospitals which caused an<br>even more crisis and catastrophe<br>so these organisations that are now part<br>of the critical national infrastructure<br>that a private sector owned now need to<br>show to governments and insurance<br>organizations that they are being<br>prepared and I've seen this with the<br>Canary Wharf group in London they have a<br>resilience group that works very closely<br>with the government and all the big bank<br>representatives come together for<br>meetings with blue light services and<br>prepare for all sorts of different<br>scenarios and events not just one kind<br>but several of threats that might happen<br>and then how would they respond to that<br>collectively as a group considering<br>they're all sharing a shared space in<br>London I think business continuity<br>managers for example have quite a<br>difficult time trying to convince people<br>that sometimes there is a threat and<br>certainly in the UK there's a risk<br>register for every region that you can<br>go on the website and see what the risks<br>are in your particular region which can<br>you know educate managers and they can<br>look to to do scenarios with their staff<br>part of their training to look at how to<br>be prepared for different types of<br>events and also they can work with local<br>government agencies organizations in<br>their geographical area so for example<br>if it's a large shopping mall or if it's<br>the CBD area involve all the companies<br>that are around a certain area and bring<br>their representatives together with blue<br>light services and government and so<br>forth to play out some of these<br>scenarios it's called exercising and<br>it's very common in the UK to come<br>across these large exercises going on<br>where they'll be playing out of scenario<br>and close certain streets and that's<br>part of the public/private partnership<br>so that there's a higher awareness<br>amongst general population of what's<br>going on<br>also compliance and audits are useful<br>but they often are just as the minimum<br>it's about getting everyone to be aware<br>so we could look at a Reece<br>example like because suddenly with the<br>Lindt cafe and and you could ask<br>questions about where those staff<br>prepared for any kind of incident where<br>they where that they are near the<br>critical national infrastructure such as<br>channel 4 studios which was right across<br>the road and thereby being nearby they<br>could potentially be involved in<br>something at any time and also where the<br>staff had they practiced scenarios and<br>without trained and what to do certainly<br>in some of the large hotels here in<br>Auckland I remember over 20 years ago<br>being trained to be aware of bomb<br>threats and certain types of things that<br>might happen when there's high-profile<br>people staying in the hotel who could<br>potentially be a target so it's about<br>that awareness at all levels of the<br>organization and making sure that<br>everyone is prepared and aware that<br>something could happen at any time<br>organisations can improve their<br>resilience through a number of means one<br>of them is to recognise where they're<br>located and so if you're near iconic<br>sites like Sky Tower or postcard<br>potential targets like museums or<br>historic buildings or even near Eden<br>Park any of these very big iconic<br>structures then you have to realize you<br>could be vulnerable as well not just if<br>you're by an airport for example and the<br>threat can be that your location is near<br>other organizations similar to your own<br>so in a CBD for example I mentioned<br>Canary Wharf before there's about 18 or<br>20 global banks there they're all there<br>because they want to be together they<br>want to cluster but by being all<br>together they're actually raising their<br>threat profile it's a higher level of<br>risk by actually being all together<br>because they can all be targeted in ways<br>through terrorism which will mean that<br>globally all their brands are affected<br>and one go so you have to be aware of<br>where you're located the type of<br>vulnerability that could be coming<br>through whether it's a cyber threat<br>within the organization whether it's an<br>external threat to your building or<br>infrastructure or if it's to an<br>organization in your supply chain or<br>your geographical area you need to think<br>about your community resilience your<br>corporate resilience is multi-layered<br>levels of resilience you need to be<br>thinking about and have a more joined-up<br>approach working with the public<br>services on how you respond because the<br>main aim is business<br>recovery getting business back to usual<br>and the recovery of the economy or the<br>entire region as quickly as possible so<br>therefore there's a real need not to be<br>complacent not to think that some of the<br>threats are not ever present they are<br>present and it's about being aware that<br>you need to be investing and being<br>resilient and you need to be creating a<br>culture inside the organization that<br>people are able to know what to do it in<br>the context of any kind of extreme event<br>not just relying on the business<br>continuity manager let's say being able<br>to be empowered and haven't done<br>exercises to look at different kinds of<br>events that may happen and therefore<br>know what to do if they're faced with</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
