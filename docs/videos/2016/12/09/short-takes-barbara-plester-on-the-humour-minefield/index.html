humour.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>well most of us enjoy humor in the<br>workplace and the benefits we have is<br>that brings a warmth and inclusion a<br>collegiality to the workplace it can<br>break up the boredom of a long hard day<br>it diffuses tension among groups of<br>people it can help people who are a<br>little bit different too to be included<br>if they can share a joke and it can<br>allow managers to save face sometimes<br>and also allows workers to sometimes<br>challenge managers in a joking way<br>that's not so threatening humor is<br>easier than fun fun has got that safe<br>element it's quite wholesome usually in<br>the workplace it's like play it's<br>light-hearted as part of its definition<br>whereas humor has the dark biting side<br>it's a little bit risky and it's naughty<br>we use humor to bring out some of our<br>things that we're not really allowed to<br>say so it has their edge to it and the<br>easier and riskier it is the funnier it<br>is so humors difficult it's risky and<br>funny but can we get away with saying<br>that sometimes we do depending on who's<br>around us in the context and sometimes<br>we can't fun stays very piecey at work<br>people arrange from the activities that<br>are careful but humor happens more in<br>the moment it's more spontaneous so you<br>get that edge to it and that definite<br>possibility that it just might all go<br>horribly wrong a good example is our<br>Prime Minister made an off-the-cuff quip<br>about someone who was in the media for a<br>crime and he made it quick quit in the<br>moment and it went horribly wrong and he<br>was forced to apologise and it wasn't<br>something he should have been<br>light-hearted about now he did that very<br>spontaneously very quickly probably<br>didn't even think about it and then paid<br>the price afterwards and that's what<br>humour is all about sometimes it's that<br>very momentary spontaneous quip that can<br>get you into a bit of trouble when you<br>look back on it and in my research I was<br>a nun law firm that started a very safe<br>piece of humor about being politically<br>correct PC and a very nice older<br>gentleman started this piece of humour<br>saying the world has gone mad PC must be<br>a red okay<br>I am the PC Eradicator now as he put<br>this in an email and sent around the<br>staff with a very light-hearted approach<br>unfortunately people added to it and<br>this piece of humor got a little bit out<br>of hand and started talking about the<br>lesbian cartel that runs our country and<br>that was deemed a bit inappropriate but<br>everyone still laughed and everyone<br>thought was funny while it stayed inside<br>the law firm but an email it gets out<br>there three or four people sent that<br>email out to partners and then the email<br>got dispersed so the next step was that<br>email with all its content got published<br>in a national publication naming the law<br>firm and naming the gentleman who had<br>started it in attributing all of the<br>remarks to her so my research has shown<br>that a boundary is constructed it's<br>socially constructed within a workplace<br>it's not something we sit down and have<br>a strategic meeting about where are our<br>boundaries to humor but it's something<br>that everyone over time just understands<br>where the boundaries are so they<br>construct them together they and people<br>just intuitively know so a new person<br>has trouble they have to decode this<br>they have to work out where that<br>boundary sits and as a new person it's<br>quite difficult to join the humor until<br>you understand what the boundaries are<br>for that particular company that group<br>of people that context it's very<br>contextual the people making the jokes I<br>like to call them the Joker's they are<br>really good at pushing those boundaries<br>out a little bit but they understand<br>very well where the boundaries are they<br>push them and because they're good at<br>humor and they understand the context<br>well they are the ones who can push it<br>there are a group of people I like to<br>call the gatekeepers and the other ones<br>that bring them back in again they will<br>say hey you've gone a bit far I had a<br>wonderful woman and a law firm who said<br>keep the party clean jep's keep the<br>party clean and and brought the boundary<br>beckon when she thought humor had<br>crossed the line a bit so it's all about<br>where the foundry sits and in very<br>formal companies the boundaries are much<br>safer much more constricted so that<br>comes down to company culture in a more<br>informal small company typical of what<br>you might find a New Zealand workplaces<br>those boundaries can be a bit wider<br>because people know each other a lot<br>better but one of the size of humour is<br>laughter and we as<br>that laughter means everyone's enjoyed<br>the humor but laughter is very<br>contagious<br>again very context you'll people get<br>swept up in it and sometimes people<br>laugh even though they finding the humor<br>offensive it's very hard to be that<br>person who is standing there not<br>laughing so people will laugh along and<br>therefore the Joker assumes everyone<br>like set humor everyone's enjoying it<br>but sometimes they laughter is<br>embarrassed laughter or just I'm<br>laughing along with everyone else it<br>doesn't mean that everybody's enjoyed<br>their humor and then afterwards you<br>might get a complaint that joke went<br>across the line that was an<br>inappropriate joke it made me<br>uncomfortable even though that person<br>laughed with the group because it's very<br>difficult not to laugh so humor is<br>complex in at work it's it's even more<br>complex so it can be wonderful it can be<br>warm we need humor we need it to get<br>through our day but sometimes it goes<br>horribly wrong and my advice is when it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
