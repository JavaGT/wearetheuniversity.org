0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I think it's really unfortunate that we<br>don't really know what KiwiSaver is for<br>and that's why we get such confused<br>political debates is it to increase<br>national saving is it to make low middle<br>income people better off in retirement<br>or is it to cure our problems with a<br>high exchange rate and because we<br>haven't actually sorted that out we get<br>very confused debates and the<br>possibility that changes might be<br>introduced that might be quite adverse<br>in my view I think the reason we have<br>KiwiSaver is very clear the idea was to<br>provide coverage for people who would<br>otherwise miss out on an opportunity to<br>have a work-based savings plan and to<br>provide a supplement to universal new<br>zealand superannuation and if we see it<br>clearly in that light then we won't be<br>sidetracked into thinking that it's all<br>about the numbers that are in KiwiSaver<br>or all about the size of kiwisaver we<br>should be looking specifically at that<br>particular group of people that we think<br>need to have additional assistance for<br>an adequate retirement at the moment we<br>are just entering into the retirement of<br>the baby boom cohort those are the ones<br>that were born post-war 1946 1966 so<br>they're all going to be retired by 2031<br>and that means that we're seeing a very<br>rapid increase in early retirement<br>numbers so this is this is the good part<br>of the demographic picture it doesn't<br>look quite so good as we go beyond 20 31<br>because the baby boomers then start to<br>enter into older age and by 2050 one the<br>last of the baby boomers has turned 85<br>so we've got the whole of the baby boom<br>cohort over 85<br>and that is where some of them the<br>expenses can in health care particularly<br>long-term care if we really think that<br>KiwiSaver should be about making sure<br>that people have extra income in<br>retirement particularly the low middle<br>income group who miss out otherwise on<br>web based savings schemes then it<br>doesn't make much sense to deliver them<br>a lump sum and to tell them to go away<br>and manage that lump sum in the context<br>of ever increasing longevity and the<br>uncertainties of the investment market<br>and inflation of course as well so we<br>don't have anything at the moment which<br>helps people d accumulate that lump sum<br>in a way that gives them some protection<br>against living a long time the<br>traditional way of helping people d<br>accumulate the lump sums in retirement<br>is through annuity products and they're<br>very big overseas but New Zealanders<br>don't have much familiarity with this<br>concept in fact we don't actually have<br>an annuities market and the reason that<br>we don't have an annuities market is<br>that the government plays no role<br>whatsoever in that market and therefore<br>it disappears it has to be actually<br>underpinned by some sort of government<br>action if we're going to have such a<br>thing an annuity is a an income stream<br>that goes on as long as you live<br>essentially those that live the longest<br>are subsidised by those that died<br>earlier so that it all works out<br>unfortunately for private providers if<br>they're looking at an annuity product<br>and they don't know what's going to<br>happen to future longevity then they can<br>get the sums wrong and find it a very<br>unattractive product to provide as<br>people live ever longer than was<br>expected<br>and there are other issues as well it's<br>very hard for private providers to<br>provide an inflation component to an<br>annuity say usually traditional<br>annuities have been fixed in dollar<br>terms and of course then they lose value<br>over time at the Retirement Center what<br>we are working on is an annuity product<br>which would have a considerable<br>government role in it but what it would<br>do is provide an ongoing income stream<br>to people that give up the lump sums<br>they'd get the income stream but there<br>would also be a long-term care rider<br>attached to it so that at the point of<br>needing long-term care which is very<br>expensive there would be an increment a<br>tripling sale of that annuity which<br>would then give a sufficient amount to<br>meet the kept fee of long-term care and<br>would help spread the costs of that<br>long-term care more equitably if we<br>don't start thinking about these things<br>what we're going to find is that the<br>working age population will be<br>overburdened with caring for a larger<br>older population and feel that it is<br>unjust because many of the older<br>population will have considerable wealth<br>and assets so what is really important<br>is to get some sharing of resources<br>amongst the older generation themselves<br>and that is what an annuity product<br>would do and by doing that take some of<br>the pressure off the working age<br>population and of course if you<br>incorporate long-term care insurance<br>into the design of an annuity there<br>again you're providing a mechanism which<br>doesn't make the costs go away the cost<br>is still there but a mechanism whereby<br>it's more fairly funded from the<br>resources of the older population<br>themselves as a group rather than people<br>getting a lump sum dissipating it early<br>in return<br>and then having to fall back on the<br>state for full long-term care and other</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
