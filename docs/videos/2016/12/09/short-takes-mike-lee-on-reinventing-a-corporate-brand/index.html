rebrands.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in this dynamic market environment there<br>are a number of reasons why a company<br>might find the need to reinvent its<br>brand rebrand reposition itself these<br>reasons could include technological<br>changes and social cultural changes<br>demographic changes you know market<br>changes of any sort in recent times in<br>New Zealand market we've seen three<br>fairly big companies reinvent or rebrand<br>themselves these include Zed from shell<br>telecom going on to spark and Air New<br>Zealand who reinvented itself in a very<br>different way so it's interesting to<br>look at these three examples because<br>they've all gone about it in fairly<br>different ways with you know equally<br>significant amounts of investment Zed is<br>an interesting case because obviously<br>they change their brand name because the<br>licence ran out for shell and instead of<br>paying royalties to the shell<br>organization they decided to change the<br>name to Zed being New Zealand a new<br>zealand own company now and so when they<br>went about it they change the name first<br>and their logo and this met a lot of<br>cynicism and skepticism people were<br>accusing them of just slapping a fresh<br>coat of paint onto the company and not<br>really making any changes it's not on<br>until recently we've seen some of these<br>changes happening sort of after they've<br>changed the logo and the name and and<br>they're more positive now so that's one<br>way of doing it is to change your name<br>and your brand first and then to make<br>the business changes later with telecom<br>they claim to sort of be approaching in<br>a different way so they're they're<br>claiming that they've changed the<br>business model over the last few years<br>half a decade they're moving more into<br>clouds iPad sort of apps and all these<br>sorts of you know more dynamic<br>environments being a data company as<br>opposed to a telecommunications company<br>and so they've made the changes then<br>there was that transitional period in<br>the Middle where they change their logo<br>from the old logo to the new what we<br>know now is the spark logo and now it's<br>come to the very end of that transition<br>and they're going to change their name<br>from telecom to spark and so the<br>argument there is that the business has<br>already changed and it's simply just a<br>name change at the end and we contrast<br>those two examples with the third<br>example of air new zealand<br>that's probably the most interesting<br>case in my mind because here's an<br>example of a company that went through<br>equally significant changes to the<br>business model if not more significant<br>than the changes experienced by Z and<br>telecom so they reinvented their brand<br>completely using your design that<br>thinking changing the customer<br>experience the look of the planes<br>interior exterior of the above but<br>they've done they've reinvented<br>themselves without changing the brand<br>name at all and so that's a very<br>interesting example of you know hanging<br>on to the brand equity and the heritage<br>that's tied in with the Air New Zealand<br>brand but changing everything else<br>essentially about the business and in a<br>way it's more of a genuine adaptation of<br>the of the company in my mind so<br>rebranding is obviously a very expensive<br>investment and the downside of just<br>changing the name is that nothing else<br>really changes so essentially it's like<br>painting a bus a new color and calling<br>it a new trans public transport state<br>and system so if you change your brand<br>your logo and all the signature<br>letterheads etc the color of the font<br>that's a very superficial level of<br>changing and unless the business model<br>changes dramatically and the culture<br>changes to adapt to these new<br>circumstances it really is just a waste<br>of time you're literally painting a<br>building with a new color and that's it<br>ends there and that's a huge investment<br>you know in both in terms of time and<br>cost and so the argument as well why not<br>invest that money into actually changing<br>the company for the better as opposed to<br>just changing the brand name so that's<br>the downside in terms of positives I<br>guess changing your name does send a<br>signal out there both externally to the<br>marketplace but also internally to the<br>employees that the company is still<br>relevant it's still dynamic changes<br>afoot and changes for the better<br>hopefully to make the company more you<br>know adaptable to the to the new market<br>environment whatever the path the<br>company chooses to reinvent itself or<br>rebrand or reposition itself there are<br>some essential points to remember first<br>one is you know make sure you're doing<br>it for the right reason so in some cases<br>a name change or rebranding of an<br>organization can come across almost as a<br>see wanting to make their stamp on<br>something they don't want to work with<br>someone else's legacy<br>they want to have their own legacy they<br>want their own baby to nurture and to<br>grow and so this is a bit of an ego trip<br>in my mind for CEO approaches rebranding<br>in that sense so you have to be careful<br>that the change is actually genuine and<br>it is for the better of the company and<br>the customers the other essential point<br>to remember that is that if you change<br>then the only change that really counts<br>as the cultural change with the within<br>the organization because it's from the<br>employees behaving in a new way systems<br>being implemented to make the company<br>operate in a new sense that true changes<br>come about and those are the changes<br>that hopefully will actually matter to<br>the marketplace because at the end of<br>the day the customer doesn't really care<br>if you're a new name or a new color what<br>they want is that you're providing a new</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
