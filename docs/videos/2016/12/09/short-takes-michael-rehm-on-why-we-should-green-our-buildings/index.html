font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>green buildings have really been around<br>since the 1990s and it's it's really a<br>way of mitigating against the<br>environmental impact that our buildings<br>have so collectively our buildings use<br>massive amounts of resources<br>particularly energy and so green<br>buildings unlike your conventional<br>building will use less energy to light a<br>space use less energy to heat and cool<br>make the occupants the building<br>comfortable it'll also and use less<br>embodied energy in the material selected<br>green buildings will tend to be placed<br>in locations that will use less direct<br>resources as well so people coming to<br>the site of a green building will have<br>options of taking a train or taking a<br>bus versus just having the option of the<br>private automobile one general belief is<br>that green buildings cost more than a<br>conventional building and myself and a<br>master's student of mine Rochelle aide<br>looked into that here in New Zealand we<br>investigated the the actual costs of 17<br>office buildings in New Zealand and we<br>were expecting to measure that cost<br>premium and we figured that it would be<br>there that's what the popular belief is<br>and we found that there is no systematic<br>cost premium some of the green buildings<br>we looked at cost less than a benchmark<br>we used some cost more it was really all<br>over the map which you would expect in<br>commercial construction costs there<br>they're very variable because every<br>single building is unique the benefit of<br>green buildings covers a lot of<br>different players involved so if you<br>look first at the broadest scale society<br>obviously green buildings are using less<br>resources particularly energy a lot of<br>the energy that's fed into our buildings<br>come from fossil fuels which causes<br>climate change pollutes the air and<br>whatnot so the society benefits as far<br>as the benefits to owners there's been<br>research that shows that tenants pay<br>rent premiums for being in a green<br>building green buildings tend to have<br>slightly higher occupancy rates so<br>they're more full they tend to have less<br>churn of tenants so tenants tend to<br>renew leases as far as the long-term<br>investment<br>approach from owners of green buildings<br>they see green buildings as having less<br>risk in terms of functional obsolescence<br>down the track so there's a fear amongst<br>a property trust that they may lose<br>tenants their occupancy rates may reduce<br>overtime as new green building stock<br>comes into the market and they their<br>tenants begin to fleet this other new<br>stock in terms of the the benefits to<br>tenants they tend to get lower operating<br>expenses so a less electricity costs for<br>example lower water bills in a green<br>building there's also a benefit in terms<br>of corporate social responsibility so a<br>lot of businesses latch on to<br>environmental awareness is something<br>they're proud of and by renting or<br>owning a grain building that ticks that<br>box for them we did do some research in<br>the Sydney CBD market with a PhD student<br>of mine and it's similar to the cost<br>research we did where we're expecting to<br>find those rent premiums that a lot of<br>other research has found namely in the<br>US and some in Europe but as we<br>discovered there really wasn't any<br>premium for green buildings with in<br>Sydney CBD and if you think about it<br>there is some sense to that because the<br>the amount of operating expense savings<br>that a tenant would have is really<br>miniscule compared to the overall<br>business expenses of running a service<br>organization whether you're a finance<br>company or whatever you are the the<br>opec's costs is roughly one percent so<br>for tenants to shift around move spaces<br>purely for the OPEC savings it doesn't<br>make a whole lot of sense the thing that<br>really drives tenants and gravitates<br>them to green buildings happens to be<br>productivity gains so green buildings<br>are well known for having very nice<br>spaces and interior spaces there Dale it<br>they have a lot of natural ventilation<br>their spaces where tenants and users of<br>the space want to be so that goes into<br>that less churn that I spoke about<br>earlier that's why tendencies renew<br>people who<br>our employees with these organizations<br>these tenants they want to be in that<br>space a grand example of green buildings<br>that have superior indoor quality is the<br>aspie North Wharf recently opened here<br>in Auckland and if you've never been in<br>that space I'd highly recommend that you<br>go for a visit because it's just an<br>extraordinary interior they've put in<br>not only the green building systems but<br>a lot of the the basic interior fit-out<br>is really amazing space to work in and<br>they're going to have no no difficulty<br>retaining staff in a space like that<br>yeah not only do you have individual<br>benefits of singular and green buildings<br>but for example a opportunity does exist<br>in Christchurch I was there in January<br>for a property conference and it really<br>is a blank slate if there ever was a<br>blank slate in a major city of a country<br>like New Zealand you have that in<br>Christchurch so Christchurch is a golden<br>opportunity to maybe be able to address<br>some of the criticisms that we get as a<br>country for our branding of a hundred<br>percent pure which some rightfully feel<br>that we don't really deserve it may be<br>an opportunity to at scale at broad<br>scale across downtown Christchurch put<br>in place common threads within the<br>buildings that go up in that blank slate<br>that have green features and and some of<br>them that I would personally suggest are<br>things like green roofs it's a bit corny<br>having a green roof green building but<br>it's something that the general public<br>can latch on to they could appreciate<br>what I could see at some stage is maybe<br>a one of the new buildings having an<br>observation deck high up and I don't<br>know if that's part of the plan but it<br>would be an amazing thing to be able to<br>look down on the the roofs and and see<br>the garden city with not only garden and<br>vegetation on the ground but up on the<br>roof level at the top of all the<br>buildings so for example in in Chicago<br>where I come from that's my hometown the<br>the mayor of that city embraced the<br>concept of green roofs and what what<br>the legislation said is if single dollar<br>goes into any building with in chicago<br>in a new building it had to have a green<br>roof so there's several benefits of<br>green boobs one is it has superior<br>insulation so all the medium the growing<br>medium at the top of the roof insulates<br>the high temperatures of the Sun beating<br>down on the roof the key benefit is<br>stormwater retention so your typical<br>civil engineer designing stormwater in a<br>building will design every ounce of<br>water hitting a roof to zip straight to<br>the the stormwater system and what that<br>means is systems are all designed for<br>the massive rain events whereas if you<br>have a green roof you have an area of<br>space to absorb the the massive water<br>that comes in a storm and then it<br>trickles out into the storm water system<br>therefore you don't have to keep on<br>expanding the size of the storm water so<br>in terms of the practicalities of having<br>a common thread in Christchurch such as<br>putting green roofs on the new new<br>buildings that go up there taking<br>Chicago as an example it has to be led<br>from the government it has to be<br>supported from the government telling<br>developers that they must just do it is<br>not going to be an effective way forward<br>there has to be some kind of financial<br>support from New Zealand so this is<br>supports the the 1i r % pure New Zealand<br>brand and it shows our commitment to the<br>environment it could inevitably be a eco<br>tourism hub rather than just going out<br>and seen nature in terms of ecotourism<br>there's no reason why an urban<br>environment might be a model example<br>where people will come and see what is<br>possible when you do have a clean slate<br>like we do put in government funds into<br>greening downtown Christchurch makes a<br>lot more sense in my view than the the<br>small bang for the buck that you might<br>get in say hosting the Rugby World Cup<br>or hosting another America's Cup this is<br>something that's long-term its enduring<br>and will have great benefits for the<br>country</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
