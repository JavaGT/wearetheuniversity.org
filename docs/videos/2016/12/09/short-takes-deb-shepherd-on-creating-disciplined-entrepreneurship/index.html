font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>entrepreneurship is really important and<br>the last couple of decades have given a<br>lot of attention and focus on<br>entrepreneurship and innovation which is<br>absolutely fantastic because that's my<br>area of interest and I think it is<br>critical to the success of New Zealand<br>and the success of the economic growth<br>New Zealand's a country of small or<br>medium-sized businesses there's about<br>460,000 SMEs in New Zealand and only one<br>hand we have this reputation for being<br>entrepreneurial and innovative and I<br>think there's a great deal of truth in<br>that however recently that's been<br>questioned and one of the challenges<br>we've got is how do we get those s emmys<br>to grow and develop and we're looking at<br>it from both the research point of view<br>and an education point of view what can<br>what can entrepreneurs do to really push<br>the businesses forward and we're arguing<br>that in fact as well as focusing on<br>opportunity recognition opportunity<br>exploitation and being very<br>entrepreneurial in the marketplace<br>equally there needs to be the discipline<br>of really understanding the competitors<br>being customer-focused bringing in place<br>the disciplines in the processes to<br>really develop capability and capacity<br>and exploring what's going on the<br>marketplace it's going to be really<br>disruptive to their industry to their<br>business and trying to preempt and<br>predict some of those challenges so<br>there's an inherent paradox in this<br>concept of disciplined entrepreneurship<br>often the entrepreneurial owner manager<br>is the person that's brought the<br>business to its success yet<br>paradoxically the same person might be<br>the greatest inhibitor to future success<br>the practices that disciplines the<br>organizational behavior that's led to<br>the success equally might be the things<br>that restrain it from future success so<br>we suggest to owner-managers that we<br>work within the education space to be<br>asking questions of themselves in terms<br>of their own leadership capability and<br>capacity the air ability to grow and<br>develop the staff around them to ask<br>questions that perhaps they're not<br>asking about whether the business is it<br>currently<br>structured and addressing the<br>marketplace whether in fact that will be<br>what's going to take them forward so we<br>asked them to really reflect on<br>themselves in terms of their capability<br>and capacity as well as that of the<br>organization and do that in the context<br>of the broader macro environment that<br>they were operating in 13 years ago one<br>of my colleagues dr. Christine woods and<br>ice were invited to be part of something<br>that was developing called the owner<br>manager program that's a partnership<br>between the University of Auckland<br>Business School in the ice house and<br>that program was developed and<br>recognition of the fact that actually<br>there's very little in the marketplace<br>for owner-managers of SMEs historic<br>that's just not been an era of education<br>that we're focused on so for 13 years<br>we've been working in that space and the<br>the primary focus is to bring SME<br>owner-managers into an organizational so<br>into an educational context where they<br>can hear from academics and<br>evidence-based research and material<br>that's of relevance to them they can<br>hear from other practitioners but as<br>importantly they can get together with<br>other owner managers and have<br>conversations about what's working for<br>them what isn't and share and learn from<br>each other's experiences one of the<br>examples of disciplined entrepreneurship<br>that that many people will be familiar<br>with from a consumer point of view is<br>juicy rentals so two brothers dan and<br>term ALP founded this business some<br>years back and it is absolutely<br>innovative and entrepreneurial in terms<br>of the way it approaches the market in<br>terms of its marketing and branding the<br>way it's it's growing and developing<br>through both its vertical in terms of<br>buying hotels and boats and other parts<br>as well as horizontally into new<br>international markets so without a doubt<br>that is very entrepreneurial equally<br>though behind the scenes in the part<br>that we often don't see is that it has a<br>as a business it has a very strong focus<br>on building IT infrastructure so that it<br>is absolutely world class in better than<br>its competitors the focus is on building<br>an amazing people culture and developing<br>people and the capacity and capability<br>so that they can continue the growth of<br>the<br>they have bought a really strong<br>governance and advice structures around<br>them so that they are getting outside<br>perspectives and different important and<br>views around the industry around the<br>marketplace and around what's<br>potentially going to disrupt and as<br>leaders both Dan and term have continued<br>to grow and develop as the entrepreneurs<br>as the founders one of the challenges<br>for us as an economy is this idea of<br>sustainable growth I think that what we<br>don't want to see from New Zealand<br>businesses is lumpy growth where they<br>you know the trajectory goes up steeply<br>but it's unsustainable and so the<br>interest there that we have from both a<br>research point of you and also from an<br>educational point of viewers how can we<br>encourage entrepreneurial owner-managers<br>towards sustainable growth and for us<br>this means absolutely the focus on<br>entrepreneurial behavior entrepreneurial<br>thinking opportunity recognition and<br>exploitation and alongside that and it's<br>very much an end not an or and alongside<br>that bringing with them the discipline<br>the processes the systems the right<br>advice the people the infrastructure the<br>capital that's needed to actually go<br>forward and this is particularly true<br>for New Zealand businesses going<br>offshore</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
