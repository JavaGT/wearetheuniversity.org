culture.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>there might be misconceptions about what<br>design actually does I feel that often<br>people have this view about just trying<br>to sell products with a nice styling and<br>in reality it's so much connected to the<br>whole company's process and their the<br>values that they are they have in their<br>corporation so design should be an<br>expression of the good values that you<br>want to build in your company and also<br>with designers there is always also<br>sometimes a quite defensive attitude of<br>trying to prove monetary value of what<br>you're doing or trying to to bring the<br>good cases where you you see see the<br>good case is how it's supposed to be<br>done if the willingness not there to<br>change or you know wanting to become a<br>different company then it will be<br>difficult to sell design services to<br>that company unless you understand what<br>you can become because that's the<br>interesting part of design that it can<br>actually change corporate culture and<br>bring a completely new experience to sue<br>customers we work with the process from<br>three different perspectives you could<br>say one is about how do you actually<br>create the customer experience<br>throughout the company there you need to<br>adapt to several kinds of processes and<br>and several kinds of interfaces where<br>within the company and towards the<br>customer and that's where we need to<br>understand the the customer needs in in<br>that and the customer experience of<br>interacting with Volvo secondly you have<br>the user experience of a particular<br>product or a particular server<br>is where you need to understand more in<br>detail that particular product<br>requirement or the context that it's in<br>and thirdly we need to understand<br>customers in a broader view you know<br>where are their minds tomorrow and how<br>will society react to changes that we<br>see around us and that's what trigger<br>innovation and new thinking to with our<br>design team so you can see it's like<br>understanding the customer the user and<br>society so it's like three different<br>levels of involving also our customers<br>into the process emotional capital is<br>about understanding what you are<br>building into your product your brand<br>and your services in terms of of what<br>kind of emotions it will trigger with<br>the customer or the user and and it's<br>not only about you know oh this product<br>makes me feel good it's sometimes about<br>understanding this this sort of library<br>of preconceptions or misconceptions even<br>that we might have as people our brains<br>are constantly using information<br>visually information or sense or even<br>tactile information putting that<br>together in a very quick way in our<br>brains now what kind of concrete effect<br>does this have on our work well we have<br>examples where a certain design might be<br>brilliantly done but still the customer<br>didn't connect it to the real values we<br>have a truck that was sold with a<br>certain design but it didn't attract the<br>customer segment and when we redid the<br>design more trying to capture that<br>particular group of customers suddenly<br>they could understand the quality of the<br>so the specification sheet was exactly<br>the same but the change of design make<br>that those qualities more understandable<br>for the customer so they understood that<br>this product is for for me and that's<br>not just a trigger like a good feeling<br>of like wow it's attractive because of<br>course that's important but as I said<br>both of those designs were attractive<br>but one of them really connected to that<br>customers feeling of what do I want what<br>do I need so that's where sales rocketed<br>for that particular product you need to<br>be consistent with what you what kind of<br>values you want to build so the<br>emotional capital is about being really<br>consistent in your approach so in your<br>process you need to have these kind of<br>leading stars for your design so what<br>disc's expresses must be consistent with<br>what you then also experience with using<br>the product what we often do is that we<br>have a theme for the development of a<br>product like for the camp of the<br>articulated hauler the whole theme was<br>controlled the feeling of control which<br>led to the positioning of the driver or<br>the operator in the center of of of the<br>cab which gives so much benefits in<br>terms of both comfort but also of<br>control and being able to see everything<br>perfectly around you and also all the<br>sort of the styling cues the positioning<br>of the pillars the how we shape the<br>hoods everything needs to be directed<br>from that emotional or experience that<br>we wanted to to create so that's very<br>much you know having a consistent<br>approach around that theme the changes<br>that we see around us in in society and<br>in technology it more and more leads us<br>to understanding that we can no longer<br>just work with<br>sort of the machine itself or the try<br>train both from an environmental point<br>of view or from a technological point of<br>view how where things are moving we need<br>to put the product more in context<br>because efficiencies both in terms of<br>profitability for customers and for the<br>environment to use less to produce more<br>that's where we need to understand how<br>can we provide the services the<br>realistic solutions<br>or the very you know the inter link<br>between the product digital solutions<br>and the context understanding the whole<br>process for our customers that's where a<br>lot of of innovation will will be for<br>for our coming products and and for the<br>future our role being a design<br>department within the company is of<br>course to to create that consistent<br>approach to our customers and by that<br>changing the corporate culture with you<br>know how we approach our customers what<br>kind of experience we are creating for<br>them but also our role is to provoke or<br>challenge our management internally so<br>as much as we're working with this<br>exterior connection and the contact<br>involving our customer in understanding<br>their needs as much as an internal role<br>of presenting or challenging management<br>with and even challenging ourselves with<br>radical other ideas about what the<br>future might be for us and what kind of<br>solutions we must provide changing the<br>corporate culture by challenging and<br>constantly reminding management about<br>what we need to do where we need to move</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
