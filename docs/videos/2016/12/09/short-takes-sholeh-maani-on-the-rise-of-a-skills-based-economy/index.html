Maani, a Professor of Economics in the Graduate School of Management, explains the link between skills and economic growth.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the prosperity of countries and<br>individuals has changed over the past<br>centuries and the main reason for it is<br>related to the fundamental parts of the<br>economy the aspects of the economy that<br>provide the base of production nature of<br>economies has changed from being<br>predominantly agricultural to industry<br>and manufacturing and now we're at a<br>stage where services are based on the<br>skills or the factors that contribute to<br>growth of economies and prosperity of<br>countries and individuals initially land<br>was the main factor that contributed to<br>production then since the Industrial<br>Revolution investment capital became an<br>added but very significant factor and<br>now from the middle of last century what<br>we have experienced is that the skills<br>have become an added but fundamental<br>part of economic growth and production<br>and and this change has brought a number<br>of other changes with them that have<br>contributed to the current state of<br>economies skills and economic<br>performance are related in many<br>different ways one of the major effects<br>of this skill based economy that started<br>in the 20th century is that a middle<br>class was created and that has changed<br>the structure of income distribution in<br>countries around the world forever there<br>are other fundamental relationships as<br>well there are three in particular that<br>I'd like to refer to now one is the link<br>between skills and lifetime earnings and<br>the studies around the world show that<br>earning levels of two times or three<br>times higher over the lifetime are quite<br>common for university or higher<br>education compared to completion of<br>secondary education the second effect is<br>the link between employment<br>opportunities and<br>when we consider employment rates around<br>the world for university graduates<br>compared to high school graduates or the<br>labor force without a high school<br>graduation diploma we find that<br>differences of thirty to forty percent<br>in employment rates are common in many<br>countries you would notice that this<br>changes across the business cycle but<br>the differences are very prominent and<br>become bigger during recessions as well<br>the third effect is the link between<br>skills and productivity and growth and<br>countries that have invested in skills<br>in the past decades have been<br>experiencing and showing much higher<br>growth at this point in time so the link<br>between an additional year of Education<br>and earnings is significantly high<br>around the world and in New Zealand some<br>recent measures show that the world<br>average returns to an additional year of<br>Education is twelve percent which<br>compared to most investments it is quite<br>significant in New Zealand some of the<br>recent research that I've done shows<br>that the return to university education<br>is between nine to twelve percent per<br>year higher education matters for many<br>reasons but to that I would like to talk<br>about today or the following one is that<br>among all the policy tools that are<br>available or for lifting the standard of<br>living of disadvantaged population<br>groups education and in particular<br>higher education is the most effective<br>policy in the long time it takes longer<br>sometimes the results become fully<br>manifest in 20 to 25 years and for this<br>reason as a policy tool it may not<br>sometimes get the attention that it<br>deserves the other reason why it really<br>matters is that the sectors that are<br>showing the highest growth at this time<br>and they will continue to be important<br>four countries are those that require<br>skills and that includes technology<br>innovation and high school services<br>there are a number of forces at work in<br>relation to the higher education sector<br>in the future decades one of the effects<br>that is expected to continue is that<br>skills are important to economies and<br>they will continue to be fundamentally<br>important so for that reason demand for<br>higher education will continue to exist<br>I am the second effect is that the<br>demand for education from Asia is going<br>to become a lot more prominent it's<br>partly the age effect in that more than<br>sixty-two percent of the age group in<br>the world of 15 to 29 years lives in<br>Asia at this time a second effect is<br>that the middle class in Asia is growing<br>very significantly and both of these<br>factors are going to contribute to a<br>much higher demand for higher education<br>a third effect is that education will<br>become a lot more global the<br>globalization of the higher education<br>sector will become more prominent and<br>that is relevant to both students and<br>graduates of higher education that will<br>be working in a much more global economy<br>and and their education will have a much<br>more global application and it will also<br>have impacts for institutions in forming<br>partnerships with other global partners<br>finally higher education of high quality<br>has the highest return for graduates the<br>lesson for New Zealand is that skills<br>will continue to be important in the<br>world economy and both the provision of<br>higher education and also work in the<br>skilled sectors of economies will become<br>much more global and competitive so for<br>New Zealand it's important to be mindful<br>of opportunities that exist and<br>challenges that we may face I in<br>maintaining our leading position in<br>having a skill based economy<br>and also a provider of high-skilled<br>education</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
