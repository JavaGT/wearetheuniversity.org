Management in the Graduate School of Management, explains why we should take notice of Chinese manufacturing and service innovations.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>any country has a wide spirit of<br>practice and performance and you'll find<br>bad practice in China just like you will<br>here but there are some standout<br>companies stellar one so we need to keep<br>our eye on and find out how they're<br>doing that why they're doing that one of<br>the manufacturing firms in China that's<br>done particularly well and in fact made<br>money in the first year quite<br>surprisingly at that time was a company<br>called Auto box there's a German maker<br>of prosthetics so there are industrial<br>accidents going on around the world and<br>in China and they entered the China<br>market not to use slow low labor costs<br>to export they use it partly that<br>manufacturing footprint to supply the<br>market but they were there for a much<br>bigger bigger play which was to work out<br>how they could take their model and take<br>it to other parts of the world so into<br>other developing areas like Africa South<br>America where they are now so what they<br>did is set up a fabrication unit just on<br>the outskirts of Beijing people would<br>come with their limbs<br>you know severed two different parts of<br>the country took clinics and such one<br>province for example and be measured and<br>then those measurements would be faxed<br>to the Beijing operation this is back in<br>that in the 1990s they would make them<br>on these three-dimensional lathes and<br>then distribute them by courier back to<br>those particular parts of the country<br>and that operations model has been<br>something they've now implemented in<br>other parts of the world they also had<br>remarkable human resource management in<br>my opinion so the manager at the time<br>who's still in China Roger dad and a<br>Kiwi was clearly very interested in his<br>staff and their development the ape with<br>them was just a guy who really enjoyed<br>being there and was that interested in<br>the development of his people second<br>company is a much better known brand in<br>New Zealand having purchased Fisher and<br>Paykel appliances so higher you may<br>think of as an appliance brand but it's<br>far more than that it's a distribution<br>company so one of the holy grail of<br>China is getting into the rural market<br>how do you get products in there how do<br>you service them and hires had that<br>platform and it's now developed to the<br>extent to which had now rents it too<br>compared<br>including foreign competitors so about<br>10% of the volume going through that is<br>foreign or competitor product so there<br>now a distribution company so there's a<br>new business model which the<br>manufacturing firm has taken to expand<br>its footprint and China and actually to<br>stave off foreign competition in a way<br>moving on from the manufacturing and<br>distribution sector into the service<br>field<br>one of the standout companies of my<br>opinion is a howdy n translator means<br>the number one store which began in<br>Shanghai about 2008 and in the ensuing<br>years of being rather fastest growing<br>firms in Asia now have about 10,000<br>employees sell about 5 million different<br>products and they've just surpassed<br>Amazon in terms of their volume per year<br>they're not up there with Alibaba yet<br>but there are very much an emerging<br>player that's doing some great things in<br>their distribution network many<br>companies have started creating their<br>own structure we don't have the likes of<br>FedEx in China that are able to get to<br>the door so they're doing last mile<br>delivery and it's the last mile delivery<br>and the customer satisfaction that comes<br>from there which typifies their company<br>performance and also how they reward<br>this stuff so all the staff members even<br>the back-office people and IT rewarded<br>based on the customer experience which<br>they monitor very frequently so here's a<br>company which takes that basically a<br>single metric and puts it right up front<br>and I often wonder about New Zealand<br>companies and educational institutions<br>and how they would how they would do<br>that you know to what extent we would<br>take our employee and remuneration and<br>metrics and base it on something so<br>customer centric so I think that's<br>another film that's done really well you<br>could move further down into the<br>restaurant trade I think there are<br>companies like gung-ho Pizza run by a<br>couple of New Zealanders and Beijing<br>that's doing some great things with<br>people the way they train their<br>employees coming in the way they go and<br>visit long-standing employees the<br>parents of them back in the rural<br>villages there's another company does<br>such fun hotpot now it's about a hundred<br>and there and their chain called Heidi<br>allow this company is now a Harvard<br>Business School case study people all<br>around the world are studying how this<br>come<br>so well with their customers who wait<br>several hours to have the meal because<br>they're being entertained during this<br>period and part of that is the staff<br>members have been given a huge amount of<br>discretion autonomy to make things right<br>for the customer use the only companies<br>can benefit by looking at and finding<br>out about Chinese companies by<br>considering the fact that they're now<br>holding both very strict and strong cost<br>competition models they're around lean<br>for example in automation they've done<br>all kinds of things here to try and<br>mitigate the very high costs as we find<br>the same thing with the high New Zealand<br>dollar but they're not only doing that<br>they're now starting to move into<br>innovation so that's again been the big<br>thing for China not just to be the<br>factory of the world but the design<br>house of the world the R&amp;D centre of the<br>world so you have the likes of Microsoft<br>and Procter &amp; Gamble's setting up the<br>R&amp;D centers here pulling in these new<br>graduates engineers and scientists and<br>so on so those innovations are not just<br>product like the highway and the Lenovo<br>type innovations but they're around the<br>process of the operations and also the<br>business model and those innovations as<br>we know don't come out of the boardroom<br>necessarily they also come from the<br>people that are in the companies so how<br>Chinese companies Stella<br>exemplary Chinese companies are treating<br>their staff there's in my opinion you<br>know one of the key things we can be<br>learning about their operations the<br>models the the people behind it being<br>able to compete on more than one<br>dimension so if you're a New Zealand<br>company sourcing from China operating in<br>China or is we're going to find more and<br>more competing with Chinese companies<br>abroad and in our own market it's<br>incredibly important that you look at<br>how those Chinese countries are doing<br>well 20 years ago 30 years ago we looked<br>at Japan we looked at just-in-time and<br>lean and the spotlights gone off on<br>Japan now but there are things going on<br>in the Chinese market and then Chinese<br>companies which means young companies<br>and individuals and students of business<br>and need to be starting to take notice<br>of</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
