elsewhere.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>often when we talk about innovation then<br>we tend to end up focusing on high-tech<br>industries and it's a little bit amazing<br>because a lot of the economic activity<br>activities in society would actually<br>take place in traditional industries and<br>these industries they are actually also<br>very active in terms of innovation it's<br>just like they end up a little bit below<br>the radar as a result then we we don't<br>know a lot about how these innovations<br>they are managed and how the firms they<br>create value from them and so on from an<br>academic perspective and it also looks<br>like firms engaging in innovation and<br>traditional industries they even they<br>have some exciting innovations they tend<br>to get a little bit too little value out<br>of the activity when we look at the<br>innovation in the traditional sector<br>then it differs from high-tech<br>innovation on a number of dimensions and<br>this is not to say that innovation in<br>traditional sectors is necessarily<br>low-tech it can still be a pretty<br>advanced technologies but we can see<br>that it differs in terms of the<br>knowledge space and how you access<br>knowledge and how you might create value<br>from it and what type of uncertainty is<br>associated with the activity if you just<br>look a little bit closer into the<br>knowledge space then we would often see<br>that traditional industries they have a<br>fewer people involved in the innovation<br>so and unless formalized research and<br>development activity and would often<br>rely more on trial and error learning<br>processes however we increasingly see<br>that firms in this sector also start<br>relating to for example university<br>research and rely on university research<br>delivering knowledge and options and one<br>example on that is for example Kavita<br>and their use of medical honey for four<br>different purposes which wouldn't have<br>been possible without<br>having a strong science base to back it<br>up another aspect of innovation in a<br>traditional industries is that we often<br>see that they rely a lot on technology<br>suppliers to drive the innovation and<br>when we look at the situation in New<br>Zealand we might have ended up in a<br>corner where we have a relatively weak<br>technology sector or supplying and these<br>industries which somehow impacts their<br>ability to innovate but also but use our<br>opportunity for creating exciting new<br>products and services we could bring to<br>a global market and one example of that<br>is for example the forestry industry in<br>Finland<br>where besides having a strong forestry<br>industry it has traditionally an over a<br>long period of time build up a very<br>strong network of supplier companies<br>developing machinery and tools to the<br>forestry industry machinery and tools to<br>the paper industry and and so forth and<br>not only supplying local industry but<br>supplying these technologies on a global<br>scale and we could imagine that we in a<br>similar situation in New Zealand if we<br>got a stronger technology base or pace<br>of firms delivering technologies to our<br>core and maybe primary industries that<br>we would see that they would be able to<br>develop products and services which<br>would have a relevance abroad in many<br>markets it's a it's interesting to see<br>that innovation in high-tech industries<br>would often be associated with a high<br>level of uncertainty and we often talk<br>about that only one out of 10 of these<br>high tech companies they manage to to<br>survive and out of those who survive<br>only a small fraction might end up<br>staying put in New Zealand and grow<br>their organization here instead they<br>would go abroad and other to follow the<br>markets or the capital and so on if we<br>look at innovation in traditional<br>industries it's often stimulating<br>organic growth but it might be a little<br>bit<br>but it's also a more certain growth<br>because these companies they know their<br>markets and markets ain't know their<br>customers know their technology base and<br>so forth so instead of having the high<br>failure rate we see that it's a more<br>kind of stable and predictable growth<br>rate and an additional advantages that<br>they will often stay put in New Zealand<br>so we will see that this kind of<br>innovation activity would translate into<br>manufacturing jobs and and jobs in the<br>in the local economy an argument we<br>often hear about the the lack of a<br>technology base or base of technology<br>firms in New Zealand is this about<br>distance and a smaller market but will<br>my Danish background where we have a<br>similar a small market population around<br>two five million and a similar or<br>earlier similar industry structure with<br>a lot of reliance on the primary<br>industry I think it's important to<br>notice that firms they often don't need<br>size of market in the in the beginning<br>what they need is access to customers<br>with interesting needs and a willingness<br>to collaborate around developing new<br>technologies that serve those needs and<br>when first you have developed a solution<br>that can serve those needs it's<br>relatively easy to scale up and and<br>start exporting to other markets and<br>again<br>yeah coming from a small country like<br>like Denmark where we also rely on a lot<br>of export you can say distance really<br>matters but you will also see that most<br>of the export from countries like in<br>Scandinavia would go to North America<br>and Asia and the distance to those<br>markets are more or less the same from<br>Scandinavia and then from New Zealand so<br>I'm not sure that distances starts out<br>as significant issues<br>any longer so this area of innovation<br>and traditional<br>Industries has been a core part of the<br>center of innovation entrepreneurship in<br>the in the business school for the last<br>a year or so and we have established a<br>project looking into into this and over<br>the last half a year increasingly been<br>interacting with industry and other key<br>stakeholders involved in in traditional<br>industries and we really hope that a lot<br>of people would and firms would get<br>involved in this work and if anybody<br>would like to to contribute or hear more<br>about the project they're very welcome</p></main><footer
