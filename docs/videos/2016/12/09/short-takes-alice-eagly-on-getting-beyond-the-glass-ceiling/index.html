a Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois, offers a new way of thinking about career challenges for women.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>things are much better for women than<br>they used to be when in many fields they<br>were just hardly any women at all an<br>entry was impossible in many fields but<br>now we have you know proportions of<br>women as executives as higher level<br>political officials elected officials<br>but there's still problems the question<br>is what are the solutions that has to do<br>with how we understand the problem there<br>is a powerful metaphor that's not just<br>in any one country it's throughout the<br>Western world which is the glass ceiling<br>that women's problems is that there's a<br>ceiling up there that's rather<br>impenetrable and that we can't go past<br>it I think that metaphor is particularly<br>unhelpful because it rather simplifies<br>the problems to a challenge or a solid<br>barrier even at a very high level when<br>actually it's much more complicated and<br>the challenges that women face are not<br>just at some advanced level they're at<br>other phases too actually women<br>encounter challenges in their careers<br>that are difficult and different from<br>those that men face at all levels<br>particularly when women are young many<br>women choose to have a child or children<br>and marry and given that<br>responsibilities for caring and domestic<br>work are not usually equally shared of<br>course that can slow down women's<br>careers of that happens young so there's<br>the the idea that challenges that are<br>all levels and women are falling out at<br>all at all career stages there's also<br>the issue of the invisibility of a glass<br>ceiling you don't see it that's part of<br>the metaphor and then women hit their<br>heads on it it really rather describes a<br>kind of lack of intelligence whereas<br>women who've been<br>and careers for decades they kind of<br>know how things work and it isn't as if<br>challenges of that sort are<br>unanticipated they've seen other women<br>have problems etc so it's rather<br>unflattering in that sense and then of<br>course there's that it's impenetrability<br>without something awful happening like<br>you cut your heads or something as you<br>break the glass whereas women have<br>gotten to high positions I think New<br>Zealand has had two prime ministers who<br>are women for example some women are<br>CEOs in the United States of Fortune 500<br>companies not many but hey the CEO of<br>General Motors is a woman so women are<br>not inevitably blocked as the metaphor<br>might suggest but some of them find the<br>way around it the labyrinth that's the<br>one I'm promoting now a labyrinth has<br>complexity there's a goal in the center<br>which can be seen as women's career goal<br>or particularly women's goal she might<br>want to be CEO and so you enter a<br>labyrinth and you encounter some<br>challenges it's good to be alert and to<br>think about them it's like a puzzle so<br>it would reward intelligence and<br>analytical qualities also in the<br>labyrinth you might take a wrong turn<br>you're not lost right you've may have<br>been in some labyrinth some you turn<br>around and you try another route and the<br>secret really little habits you can make<br>mistakes and recovery is persistence as<br>that is true in careers in a way in a<br>sense we all have reverses and<br>challenges some days that don't go well<br>but rather than say oh I can't do that<br>the idea is persistence and thought and<br>analysis and that there multiple routes<br>sometimes I think it's a more<br>appropriate metaphor that's more hopeful<br>it doesn't say that everything is equal<br>in my writing I say that women don't<br>exactly have a labyrinth they have a<br>road with a few bumps in it you know but<br>it isn't the complexity of the issues<br>that women face<br>in many countries dropping out is can be<br>a career killer it shouldn't be but it<br>shows slows things way down and often<br>it's impossible for women to get a<br>professional man Darryl job again<br>so the sort of that's one part of the<br>data you're much better off if you can<br>arrange your life to at least stay in<br>part-time and and you know stay in touch<br>stay connected don't get isolated in the<br>domestic role if you care to have a long<br>term career that is you know at a high<br>level but there's also an advice around<br>behavior and what we find repeatedly in<br>research is that when women are tough<br>and strong which is you know take on the<br>masculine repertoire of behaviors they<br>get what we call backlash that who's she<br>to you don't to do that or to tell me to<br>order me about or whatever so there's a<br>lot of backlash demonstrations even for<br>taking the floor and talking a lot you<br>know it's like who's she did run on like<br>that why we let men run on like that and<br>we think it's okay so there's the whole<br>backlash component that women need to de<br>go she ate you know I hope my advice is<br>always will push the envelope but but<br>watch how people are reacting so if you<br>say oh then I'll be nice and kind and<br>sweet and not talk too much but that<br>would be perceived as weak and would be<br>a hindrance to rising so negotiating we<br>call that the double bind where their<br>expectations about a woman as a leader a<br>potential leader to show strong leader<br>like characteristics and then as a woman<br>to be nice and kind and socially<br>sensitive so negotiating that is really<br>challenging and if women aren't aware of<br>they tend to personalize the reaction<br>well I'm just not a good manager people<br>aren't liking me but not to see the<br>gender dynamics and so in general<br>research suggests that women in<br>particular do better the kind of a<br>middle ground you know where they do<br>take charge of course when they have a<br>leadership role but that they they blend<br>that with a fair amount of warmth and<br>consideration which are wonderful human<br>qualities so if they move very far out<br>of that middle ground they can you know<br>they can sort of damage their chances<br>and that is just a gender done a men<br>don't have to be in that middle ground<br>that we like them if they are but they<br>don't need to be they can be tough and<br>you know tough ruthless types and do<br>well and people admire them as heroic<br>leaders so there are all these pitfalls<br>in terms of everyday behavior in the<br>workplace and studying the gender<br>aspects of it it can be very helpful but<br>yet in the actual concrete situation the<br>woman has to figure it out there's no<br>one solution like smile you know some of<br>that's not gonna work or you know what<br>say how it's the kids or something<br>relational you know it would depend then<br>it takes a lot of creativity I think and<br>is a bit of a burden actually to be<br>thinking about this as well as thinking<br>about your job well if I could give a<br>single piece of advice to women who are<br>interested in in career in having some<br>impact and giving back as many women say<br>to their communities in in powerful<br>positions it would be the persistence<br>argument that women need to stay in and<br>strive for these careers despite the<br>fact that they will sometimes get<br>reactions that are quite unfair or they<br>may misjudged because of stereotyping so<br>those things happen but in the labyrinth<br>of course you get to turn around and<br>take another route<br>and if you stay in you got a good chance<br>of getting to something that more or<br>less fits your goal so that's the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
