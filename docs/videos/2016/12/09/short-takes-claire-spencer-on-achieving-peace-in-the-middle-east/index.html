Middle East.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>before the Arab Spring in 2011 the image<br>of the Arab world and this includes<br>North Africa as well as the Gulf states<br>and the heart of the Middle East were<br>seen as very similar in that they all<br>had authoritarian governments using<br>different techniques and approaches in<br>each place but really who kept a lid on<br>demands within their societies for more<br>political and economic participation<br>what's happened subsequently is that now<br>the lids are off if you like the<br>pressure cookers in each state is that<br>we are beginning to see the diversity<br>and complexity of individual societies<br>so that where the Arab Spring started in<br>Tunisia for example actually you can see<br>it it's earth being on its way to being<br>a success story they've had three years<br>of negotiations over a new constitution<br>they've had two sets of elections and<br>they've ended up with a government<br>effectively of national unity which<br>engages both Islamists and secular<br>parties and the challenges they face now<br>is to get on with developing the economy<br>which has suffered in recent years but<br>it's on track and I would say one reason<br>for that is Tunisia is very close to<br>Europe it's always had very strong<br>relations with France there are many<br>people who move backwards and forwards<br>from Europe so we're not talking about a<br>state which has developed in isolation<br>from its Mediterranean neighborhood and<br>therefore is using the best I would say<br>of their background links and<br>institutional understanding from Europe<br>as well as indigenous traditions if you<br>move further east in the heartland of<br>the Middle East where we now see what<br>effectively many people are describing<br>as failed States in Syria and diminished<br>government control in Iraq where<br>movements such as Isis have not only<br>been able to mobilize and take over<br>cities but also move across the border<br>between Syria and Iraq we have a<br>completely different phenomenon of<br>states which never really governed and<br>God<br>from Saddam Hussein to the government's<br>elected under Prime Minister al-maliki<br>who's now in turn been replaced by<br>another prime minister who never really<br>governed on behalf of the whole state<br>Iraq is comprised of two different<br>ethnicities Arab and Kurds and then<br>amongst the Arabs you have a Sunni<br>minority it's about a fifth of the<br>population 20% and the majority as she<br>is now under Saddam Hussein who himself<br>was a Sunni Muslim it was the Sunnis<br>even though an absolute minority of the<br>of the population who actually ruled and<br>governed but largely on behalf of<br>themselves under the Baathist party<br>whereas the Shia were seen as the<br>underdogs now the situation has reversed<br>and majority elections the shears took<br>over the government from the first<br>elections in 2005 six in Iraq when the<br>Americans were still if you like in<br>occupation after the military invasion<br>that unseated Saddam Hussein in 2003 so<br>what we now see is the fight back the<br>backlash is coming from the Sunni<br>population who are not only a numerical<br>minority about a political minority and<br>it's precisely in these uncovered and<br>unprovided four spaces that groups such<br>as Isis have been able to provide local<br>services they've actually taken over<br>cities such as Mosul by infiltrating and<br>providing services money facilities that<br>the central government in Baghdad never<br>did so that when Isis besieged<br>militarily Mosul it's already had if you<br>like an audience within a city which is<br>largely Sunni who were very disgruntled<br>about being abandoned by the Shia<br>dominated government who they saw is<br>only governing on behalf of the sheer<br>population when we come to the situation<br>where the Iraqi army units that were<br>supposedly defending Mosul in June last<br>year from the attack of Isis actually<br>saw each other they communicated with<br>each other they realized that on both<br>sides they<br>were former Baathist members and so I<br>think one of my colleagues in London<br>said that they communicated with each<br>other and said look we're both Sunnis<br>why are we fighting why is the Iraqi<br>army fighting to protect essentially<br>what is a share policy so Isis<br>communicated back to the Baathist all<br>the former Baathist officers that they<br>already knew because they both their<br>abarth East officers on the ISIS side as<br>well who had converted to the Islamist<br>cause and said drop your weapons and go<br>we're not fighting each other we should<br>both be fighting the Shia majority in<br>Baghdad who've done nothing for the city<br>of Mosul so that's when they dropped<br>their weapons and run and went off over<br>to the Kurdish areas in the north of<br>Iraq much has been made of the<br>ideological appeal of al Qaeda<br>affiliated organizations throughout the<br>Middle East and increasingly Isis which<br>is a growth from a similar ideology but<br>in fact the kind of techniques and<br>reasons why people affiliate to Isis is<br>often purely pragmatic it's out of need<br>when in cities like Mosul the local<br>authorities certain local people were<br>demanding more attention from the<br>central government for their needs to<br>make public services run for jobs they<br>were ignored when Isis arrived they<br>provided many of these facilities but<br>also as they've captured and taken over<br>the city they put pressure on individual<br>families to say look we will continue<br>providing for you if you give us one of<br>your sons as it were to be a fighter in<br>our ranks and that way we'll buy you if<br>you like local peace you will still be<br>provided for now this is one situation<br>in many where locals individuals<br>communities families come under pressure<br>not just internally but also from<br>foreign governments trying to manipulate<br>them with money in reality people in<br>given situations do what they have to do<br>to survive it's not often out of<br>ideological choice that they affiliate<br>to one side or the other it's out of<br>sheer necessity depending on the context<br>in which they find themselves just to be<br>able to live to eat to know that their<br>children can go to school in safety<br>often requires fairly hefty compromises<br>in situations where the state<br>authorities either have abandoned the<br>situation or are not willing to protect<br>people in the way that they normally<br>should for the outside world to have an<br>impact on what's happening locally and<br>obviously there is a concern that the<br>violence will spread requires more<br>thinking about a longer-term strategy<br>not just to intervene to prevent<br>movements such as Isis taking over<br>territory terrorize people terrorizing<br>people using violence but also to think<br>long and hard about how a longer-term<br>strategy could answer exactly what was<br>articulated at the time of the Arab<br>Spring the desire of the majority of<br>people in these States to be included<br>both in political systems and in<br>economies which are less corrupt and how<br>you do this I know is is very complex<br>but actually unless the outside world<br>has a kind of narrative that is<br>inclusive and says it's listening to the<br>majority demands for the creation over<br>the long term of a functioning state<br>system with institutions that respond<br>equally to the needs of citizens an<br>economy that creates jobs that actually<br>protects an autonomous private sector<br>where the state and government does not<br>dominate everything that goes on or can<br>act in ways that steal public resources<br>then I think we're going to flip I'm<br>afraid particularly in states like Iraq<br>and Syria from one crisis to another we<br>have to reach a situation in which<br>Iraqis themselves mediate their own<br>differences internally and don't rely on<br>foreigners constantly coming in to<br>assist them out of crises and for this<br>you need a solid set of state<br>institutions which equally act on behalf<br>of all the citizens rather than one<br>section of the population<br>over the other this is a long-term<br>project but it would be good if the<br>international community could invest as<br>much time and energy in creating these<br>solid institutions and finding ways to<br>make them locally appropriate and<br>entrenched rather than limited and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
