New<br>Zealand Canada and Australia and if you<br>want to sort of say where did it<br>actually happen the most I mean<br>inequality could increase because the<br>poor are getting poorer or because the<br>rich are getting richer or both it's<br>actually been both by the end of the<br>distribution the very well-off people<br>the top 1% of the population in terms of<br>income have seen their shares at least<br>double in those countries in the last 20<br>years or so last there 25 years and at<br>the other end has been at best a<br>stagnation of the incomes for the lower<br>25% or so in terms of where did it<br>happen it happened at both ends of the<br>income distribution the middle classes<br>are sort of hung in there a bit they<br>haven't gained much grown or lost much<br>ground I think the reason at the top 1%<br>share has exploded more than double<br>especially in the u.s. US and the UK<br>there's two things that go into that one<br>of which we've got a museum and one of<br>which we haven't the thing we have got<br>in New Zealand is that top pay and big<br>businesses and in government<br>has gone up a lot CEO pay has increased<br>enormously what in the United States of<br>America that the chief executive<br>officers of the big corporations thirty<br>years ago earned about 30 times the wage<br>of the shop floor worker in their firm<br>now it's more like 300 times or 400<br>times so that's a huge increase and they<br>of course bought up the salaries of all<br>their executive vice presidents with<br>that you could ask why that happened as<br>well that's we've had that in New<br>Zealand in government and you know in<br>public sector and private sector perhaps<br>not quite so much or have had it well we<br>haven't had a New Zealand and that's the<br>other sort of a third or so of the<br>increase in US and UK top pay is the<br>finance sector what's called the other<br>finance sector the people who got us<br>into such a mess in the global financial<br>crisis that's just a playground for top<br>salaries and not just for managers but<br>for traders and professionals as well<br>New Zealand we don't have much of an<br>auto finance sector so we perhaps one of<br>the reasons that our top 1% share is<br>about 9% now whereas it's 23% in the<br>United States and I think about 18% in<br>the UK is if they have a wall street and<br>a City of London and we don't why should<br>we be concerned about this increase in<br>inequality in our countries some people<br>aren't some people are celebrating it<br>some people and that really goes back to<br>how it happened it really started to<br>happen especially in New Zealand UK in<br>the US with the neoliberal as we're now<br>call it revolution or counter-revolution<br>against the welfare state which is sort<br>of ruled the roost well social democracy<br>welfare state types politics that had<br>been the story of the first quarter<br>century after the war and it was a<br>period of decreasing inequality high<br>economic growth but actually the fruits<br>of economic growth being more than<br>equally shared if you like in that sense<br>and some people caught a bit tired of<br>this and said well the unions are<br>getting too powerful income taxes are<br>too high<br>incentives for the entrepreneurial<br>people classes sort of being diluted we<br>need to stop this and with Thatcher and<br>in Britain and Reagan in the United<br>States and Roger Douglas and then<br>which in a New Zealand they they did<br>stop no they cut income tax rates a lot<br>they weaken labor market institutions<br>especially the union movement they<br>deregulated and liberalized and<br>privatized and the design effect of that<br>was achieved that the income<br>distribution widened so it happened it<br>was meant to happen in the countries<br>where it did happen I think whether but<br>was it a good thing where has it gone<br>too far well some people will say it<br>wasn't a good thing in the first place<br>that the welfare state wasn't broken<br>didn't need to be fixed others would say<br>well perhaps it had gone a bit far the<br>welfare state social democracy but maybe<br>we've gone too far in the other<br>direction and you know what we're facing<br>now is the situation where possibly<br>inequality is getting to the point where<br>social cohesion is threatened and even<br>if you like right wing commentators and<br>business people like Warren Buffett and<br>many others are getting worried about<br>that should is it income as outcomes or<br>processes that really matter about<br>inequality doesn't matter if outcomes<br>are unequal if everyone's got a<br>reasonably fair chance of getting the<br>good outcome you know put social<br>mobility if they start from a poor<br>family and they're doing well for<br>themselves<br>is it a bad thing to have Y divisions if<br>if we've got a fair chance of getting<br>I'm like lotto you can't get anything<br>fairer than a lot of you can't get<br>anything less involving skill than lotto<br>it's pure luck<br>people win twenty three million dollars<br>that someone did last year I think and<br>nobody makes a fast nobody since this is<br>outrageous they should have it taken<br>away from they golf and buy a lotto<br>ticket so this is the best ambivalent<br>attitude towards high incomes if the<br>process is seen to be fair a lot of New<br>Zealanders don't seem to be too worried<br>about the process half of New Zealanders<br>in a fairly recent poll international<br>comparison said when asked should<br>government in your country in New<br>Zealand be doing more to produce<br>inequality disagree and that actually<br>put us right at the extreme even more so<br>more than the United States so it seems<br>that a lot of New Zealanders you know<br>perhaps half of us aren't too fussed<br>about it at all<br>I would say that most people would agree<br>what<br>politics the equality of opportunity is<br>really quite important you know<br>horizontal equity if you like you don't<br>want a kid or a young person having<br>worst prospects in life because their<br>family background was unlucky<br>unfavorable poor so I think most of us<br>would think that poverty is a problem if<br>it exists and it does exist in New<br>Zealand low incomes poor households bad<br>conditions for bringing up kids and<br>stuff like that but where the<br>differences would come I think would<br>probably be in well if you give people a<br>fair go is that as far as you need to go<br>and it's up to them after that or do we<br>have to look at the outcomes as well and<br>and be a bit worried that the outcomes<br>become too unequaled people are worrying<br>that this level of inequality even if it<br>doesn't increase anymore is not<br>sustainable socially in the long run<br>they point to signs of lack or<br>disintegrating cohesion and social life<br>a sense that New Zealanders aren't all<br>in it together anymore as we used to be<br>when my generation grew up and worries<br>that a low this might be okay at the<br>moment or not causing great problems<br>that in the long run it really could<br>have serious consequences for our<br>society and our economy there is if you<br>try to look for sort of signs of what<br>inequality does the most interesting one<br>that I know of is that it correlates<br>quite strongly with decrease in trust<br>but in across countries the countries<br>which have got are the most unequal and<br>have seen the biggest increases another<br>quality less likely people in those<br>countries are less likely to trust<br>strangers which is what Trust is all<br>about and that could be a flag of a red<br>flag marking loss of social cohesion and<br>that could have very serious long-run<br>consequences</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
