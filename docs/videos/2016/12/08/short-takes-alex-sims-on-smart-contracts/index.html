benefits of smart contracts, and the technology behind them.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>ass map contractors effectively a<br>computer program which you can negotiate<br>or facilitate or even execute a contract<br>through the computer program but it<br>relies on the blockchain technology so<br>if you've heard of Bitcoin Bitcoin<br>actually created the blockchain<br>technology and so what bitcoin has done<br>is allowed the double spins situation to<br>be taken care of in the past have you've<br>had a digital asset how do we know<br>whether you haven't seen it to a and<br>also seems it to be and so what bitcoin<br>does is it creates what we call the<br>blockchain so when you've got the<br>transactions people sending money to<br>from each other it grabs it all together<br>as I've about every ten minutes all<br>those transactions are then put together<br>and then a computer has to go and solve<br>a problem and when it does that it<br>creates a block and then those blocks<br>are then put bet block is put in front<br>of the other the first block and they<br>build up over time and that becomes a<br>ledger and then people realize well if<br>you could have information about who<br>owns what then other bits of information<br>can be stored as well and that's where<br>you can start storing terms of the<br>contract the benefit of smart contracts<br>depending on what type of contract it is<br>is that you can have all these<br>intermediaries that stand in the way so<br>for example with international shipping<br>of goods you've got someone sending<br>goods someone receiving it payments have<br>to be made<br>often this finance company's involved<br>who are taken clipping the tickets there<br>might be four to eight percent that's<br>all gone you can have the money being<br>transferred immediately upon a set of<br>events that you've agreed upon the money<br>will be transferred don't need to worry<br>about anything whatsoever so that is<br>decreasing time and transaction costs<br>and also the people involved in<br>negotiating and facilitating those<br>movements due to high transaction costs<br>a lot of what we own we can actually<br>prove that we own so houses are fine<br>because they don't move you've got the<br>you've got the land transfer and<br>office and it will tell you and what's<br>incidentally all those titles<br>certificate of titles can actually go on<br>the blockchain but that's another story<br>now if you've got your bike or your car<br>there's actually no register to show who<br>owns it we do have a register for<br>example for securities the personal<br>property securities app but that doesn't<br>show who owns it just shows who's<br>granted the security over it with the<br>SMAP contracts and the blockchain you<br>can now have a cheap way of actually<br>saying I own the smartphone<br>I own this bike and that will just<br>revolutionize all sorts of things one of<br>the the big issues with SMAP contractors<br>for very very simple things they're ok<br>if it's a yes or a no has a survive yes<br>we'll pay the money but there's a whole<br>lot of other things which are not that<br>simple and a law there's a lot of you<br>know reasonable what is reasonable in a<br>computer contract can't do that so the<br>current way of thinking is okay well<br>have some of the terms and computer code<br>but they're not all of it will be some<br>of it will be manual so this is people<br>have to make judgment calls so for quite<br>a while we're going to have a the same<br>contract to dual system running while<br>our current contracts are inefficient<br>for example if you're financing a car<br>that someone else has got and they fail<br>to make a payment you've got to go find<br>them<br>and if you put it on the blockchain well<br>instant they miss a payment bang the<br>lock is disabled well it could be that<br>they missed a payment for a reason for<br>example there was a hiccup at the bank<br>now do we really want the cow<br>automatically being locked what happens<br>if it's a mother who can't be in pick up<br>her children or go to the hospital and<br>so in that situation you might want to<br>fix early break out of the contract and<br>say look give someone a second chance so<br>it's just it's not as simple as that so<br>in that situation you'd probably have<br>some of the terms that are automatic and<br>the contract in some of them know<br>they'll have a human coming along and<br>mediating between the two parties smart<br>contracts are very much in their infancy<br>there's an awful lot of work that needs<br>to be done the computer codes not there<br>there's not the scale there there's not<br>the reliability and we still don't know<br>what's going to happen and so<br>situations but they're coming okay<br>there's rapid advances there's a lot of<br>people in a lot of countries working on<br>this we need any new technology comes<br>along a lot of people get there they're<br>excited about it and it will solve<br>everything well it may or it may not it<br>will do some things very well but other<br>ones you won't want to put on the<br>blockchain because there's no point you<br>can just have an ordinary processes<br>especially at the moment when the costs<br>are so high smart contracts are just one<br>thing so you've got smart contracts on<br>the blockchain but when it's combined<br>with the Internet of Things that's wins<br>or the magic stats and what it's going<br>to do is once we get the technology all<br>sorted out it's going to mean some<br>things are we're currently doing would<br>just the cost would and time taken will<br>just be collapsed but also it's going to<br>create new opportunities that we haven't</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
