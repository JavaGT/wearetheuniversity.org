witty and wide-ranging talk about Australia and New Zealand's relationship.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it was my pleasure to introduce a gift<br>speaker this afternoon all the way from<br>Australia's ABC Studios professor<br>Robin Williams it could very well be<br>people in the audience today who may<br>recognize Robin from the big screen as<br>he's acted in the goodies Monty Python<br>in Doctor Who the fifths at Williams<br>completed a Bachelor of Science degree<br>with honors in England and has received<br>honorary doctorates and science from the<br>University of Sydney Macquarie and<br>Deakin as well as a doctorate in law<br>from the Australian National University<br>he has a diverse and prolific career<br>most notably known as a science<br>journalist and as a presenter who has<br>the ability to make science interesting<br>for almost everybody he's conducted<br>countless interviews with scientists on<br>ABC TV the rate of the nature of<br>Australia's series and appeared in the<br>world safari with David Attenborough in<br>1987 he was evicted at a national living<br>treasurer by the National Trust and as a<br>member of the Order of Australia<br>Robin has also served as president of<br>the Australian Museum Trust chairman of<br>the Commission for the future and<br>president of the Australian science<br>communicators and if his biography<br>wasn't impressive enough he's also<br>written more than 10 books including an<br>autobiography and now for something<br>completely different<br>please join me in welcoming professor<br>Robin Williams this afternoon<br>Chancellor vice-chancellor graduates you<br>are now graduates transformed before our<br>very eyes this afternoon congratulations<br>here are some words used about New<br>Zealand in this week's magazine The<br>Economist successful prosperous honest<br>happy healthy democratic free beautiful<br>and perky economically New Zealand is<br>also healthy 3.6 percent growth<br>unemployment down to 5 percent wages up<br>9 percent since 2008 the accolades go on<br>and on and here are some words about<br>Australia the Financial Review on<br>Thursday former chief scientist Ian<br>Chubb has blasted Australia's lack of<br>vision saying the country's leaders are<br>risk-averse and afraid<br>on Wednesday fin review again business<br>conditions worst in 19 months consumer<br>confidence has plunged however I live in<br>Australia and as you may have noticed<br>the land of Australia the land of Oz is<br>in the mess not just its rugby not even<br>its cricket for a change but the way its<br>politics social discourse and sense of a<br>hopeful future seem to have descended<br>into a dark dismal dreary pit we can't<br>keep a prime minister for more than a<br>fortnight I can't agree on public policy<br>or even weather today is Saturday can't<br>support our young people as they try to<br>sit out on a lifetime's endeavor or even<br>begin to emulate our past shared by New<br>Zealand of being a pioneering nation<br>socially giving women the vote first and<br>valuing matters of the mind in Australia<br>we seem to be going backwards<br>the figures once more this week of<br>students or performance in maths and<br>science in schools are dire for that<br>reason I believe Australia should be run<br>Wellington or even from Dunedin please<br>take charge we need you and there is a<br>historical precedence for this<br>are you aware if you seem to be aware of<br>this where I live but the first-ever<br>Labour Prime Minister of Australia came<br>from New Zealand he may even have been<br>the first Labour head of government<br>anywhere Chris Watson was from Otago and<br>went to school in Western just up the<br>road<br>he became Prime Minister of Australia in<br>1904 and did well apparently though<br>lasting just a few months as his tenure<br>may have been slightly illegal he wasn't<br>a citizen of Australia so you see there<br>is wriggle room for a change and I<br>propose that we asked those in charge in<br>Wellington to rescue Malcolm Turnbull<br>and his many many rivals hundreds of<br>them to relinquish his tenure recognise<br>history and devolve Australian<br>government to the land of the long flat<br>vowel and having a prime minister called<br>English will be perfectly comfortable<br>for the Aussies who after all made<br>Prince Philip a knight a couple of years<br>ago jenya flexion is a national pastime<br>in Australia when you're not brawling<br>before that happens there is a paradox<br>while lots in Australia is pitiful there<br>is one huge exception science is<br>flourishing despite the cuts despite<br>performance in schools despite<br>impediments to the careers of young<br>researchers the standards are<br>magnificent you could by the way say the<br>same about culture writing the arts all<br>combined with science as the life of the<br>intellect as I said just look at my own<br>University of the University of New<br>South Wales where I'm a visiting<br>professor Michele Simmons leads the<br>world in quantum computing and accrues<br>millions in funds at a rate that's mouth<br>watering this could be a two trillion<br>dollar industry<br>and then Emma Johnston has become<br>pro-vice-chancellor and now Dean of<br>science does superb marine research and<br>finds time to make enthralling films on<br>her work at the same time in engineering<br>from India professor Venus aaja Walla<br>has recycled over 2 million tires the<br>carbon they're off to make steel and is<br>now sharing how to mine a waste that's<br>electronic waste to yield more valuable<br>minerals than you actually get from the<br>ore itself she heads a hub representing<br>an industrial revolution other<br>universities well where to start at the<br>University of South Australia tenure<br>Munroe is the pro vice-chancellor in<br>charge of research specializes in<br>photonics that's one has two techniques<br>that can measure baby fluids to assess<br>the baby's physiological health also<br>test the composition of fuel in the<br>tanks of jet engines and enter a wine<br>bottle under the cork to see how well<br>the grogs doing without spoiling the<br>sample three-in-one an incredible<br>combination of capacities that have<br>industry queuing up of tenures door and<br>by the way she also plays the cello<br>leaves an orchestra and has three kids<br>at the University of Western Australia<br>Fiona wood has operated on 28 burns<br>victims from the Bali bombing almost<br>non-stop over two days the same after<br>the Garuda crash she developed a<br>spray-on skin to help patients lectures<br>brilliantly for medical students and by<br>the way has six children there is a<br>common theme in those examples I can't<br>quite put my finger on it but I can<br>assure you I have many many more such<br>Elizabeth Blackburn for instance from<br>Tasmania was the last Australian to win<br>the Nobel Prize and it is a similar<br>story similar sorts of stories that keep<br>me coming back to Dunedin the science<br>here too is terrific which is why I did<br>11 interviews yesterday for broadcast I<br>could have kept going the strength of<br>the University with its smaller town<br>reminds me of places like Cambridge in<br>England<br>a delayed even in Australia with its<br>list of Nobel Prize winners plus<br>actually teri Tao who's now at UCLA<br>possibly the greatest mathematician in<br>the world and places like La Jolla in<br>California with its universities San<br>Diego Salk Institute and Scripps<br>University towns with innovation<br>precincts where ideas can flourish<br>just like Dunedin and I'm intrigued by<br>the range of specialties here not least<br>the strength of psychology<br>vice-chancellor and how my IQ seems to<br>be going up 10 points every time I visit<br>I'm also intrigued by the story of the<br>Dunedin study over 40 years aiming to<br>predict the outcome of lives led<br>following informed predictions of<br>children living here it is fascinating<br>to debate and argue about such<br>scientific big ideas and they made a<br>terrific four part series on television<br>on Australian television where we<br>broadcasted earlier this year and yet<br>and yet Australia and New Zealand are so<br>different<br>one was reached by human beings say<br>fifty to sixty thousand years ago New<br>Zealand was occupied by Polynesians<br>whose ancestors were from Taiwan and<br>Melanesia only nine hundred years ago<br>and the geological heritage of both<br>countries is totally different as are<br>the plants and animals but we share many<br>things possums for example we gave you<br>possums you gave us jojoba Peterson I<br>think that's the fair swap don't you<br>then we have John Clarke and then his<br>Fred Dagg to his mates Russell Crowe<br>rusty to his mates Sam Neill great wine<br>similar frags and Morris Wilkins<br>hang on Morris Wilkins how did he get<br>there well he began with Lawrence Bragg<br>from Adelaide the youngest person ever<br>to win a Nobel Prize for science he was<br>25<br>done the work at the age of 22 Brad set<br>up the Cavendish lab<br>in Cambridge to pioneer research in<br>molecular biology they won at least ten<br>novels in the process Watson and Crick<br>were two of them those two shared the<br>Nobel Prize with Morris Wilkins who came<br>from pangoro North Island<br>he was then based at King's College in<br>London<br>Wilkins not rosalind flat Franklin who<br>died won the Nobel and it was for the<br>discoverer of the structure of DNA as<br>you know getting the prize in 1962<br>Watson Crick and Maurice Wilkins now<br>many years ago I tried once more to<br>record an interview with Wilkins and<br>phoned his home in London a girl's voice<br>with a cockney accent answered said her<br>name was Emily and she was his daughter<br>why do you want him she asked I<br>explained I do a radio science program<br>don't bother I said he'd made history he<br>was a New Zealander<br>and got a Nobel Prize he couldn't<br>possibly by definition be boring I'd<br>really like to see him but it turned out<br>he would be away while I was in London<br>but then I had an inspiration if I<br>arranged a freelancer I asked Emily<br>would you mind joining your father so he<br>could explain why he's not boring and<br>nor is his work sure she said bevor<br>laughs so I arranged it and it's one of<br>the many amazing pieces on my 42 year<br>old archive of New Zealanders who've<br>done science at the highest rank at the<br>highest level and Emily I think was<br>convinced at least she sounded so that<br>dad Wilkins was not so boring after all<br>there's a dad problem isn't there on<br>this side of the hall you know dad's<br>regarded that boring it's not fair so<br>we're in Nice united in many ways<br>Australia and New Zealand and separated<br>by a common heritage shared experience<br>and life at the nether regions of the<br>globe New Zealanders as inspired by the<br>haka and a havoc winning of<br>affective independence and self-reliance<br>Australians the blokes anyway Epsilon<br>men disguised as alpha males have<br>perfected what we call the pre-emptive<br>buckle the art of giving up before the<br>game has actually started the art of<br>underarm bowling the skillet changing<br>the rules when no one is looking except<br>as I indicated in culture and in the<br>hope of progress 30 years ago I had the<br>pleasure of featuring in the live<br>programme as you heard briefly spanning<br>15 countries World Safari hosted by<br>David Attenborough in London we had five<br>minutes each live to summarise our<br>environmental priorities and examples of<br>Natural History in Canada David Suzuki<br>talked about forests in Paris Jacques<br>Cousteau about the oceans Rajiv Gandhi<br>in Delhi was all about saving Tigers and<br>Prince Philip of all people in China<br>on cranes that's the birds not the metal<br>hoists and I was in a wildlife reserve<br>near Canberra Tidbinbilla supposedly<br>surrounded by kangaroos but it was<br>raining and all the roofs sensibly<br>pissed off to find shelter leaving me<br>alone sitting on a log about to talk to<br>1.5 billion people via satellite<br>television you should have been here<br>yesterday I told Sir David who laughed<br>well we said a few good things about<br>conservation in Australia and showed<br>some great pictures and then came the<br>New Zealand contribution from the<br>albatross colony just up the road from<br>here your presenter blithely showed film<br>of how mr. and mrs. albatross go about<br>making new chicks it was hilarious and<br>after the show went to where the BBC<br>Bristol told us that our two<br>contributions had topped the response<br>charts New Zealand and ours in harness<br>once more and that's how it should be<br>whatever the upsets of Trump of the<br>passing parade of politics of trying to<br>make it as a young professional maybe as<br>a graduate in whatever you have chosen<br>or may move - as opportunities allow we<br>must share possibilities Australia needs<br>New Zealand as never before and I hope<br>the favour can be returned from across<br>the ditch as well<br>we need synergy our combined<br>intellectual firepower is unbeatable and<br>the Australian Academy of Science this<br>week sent me messages saying you are<br>amongst our top and most valued<br>collaborators and we are United<br>vice-chancellor in the admiration as I<br>hinted before of brilliant women with<br>brains to die for or even better to live<br>for so congratulations to the graduates<br>who come from all over the world so<br>let's collaborate let's have some real<br>fun in science and matters of the mind<br>there are no borders whoever runs the<br>nation even America thank you so much<br>and congratulations</p></main><footer
