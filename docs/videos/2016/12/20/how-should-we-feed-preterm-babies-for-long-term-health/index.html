Almost all these babies grow slowly in the first month, at a time when brain growth and development should be extremely rapid. In this ten minute presentation, Liggins Institute PhD candidate Barbara Cormack explains how nutrition affects the growth and development of preterm babies in the long-term and why a higher protein intake in the first five days after birth could improve a childâ€™s growth, body composition and neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening research and to nutrition<br>for preterm babies began over a hundred<br>years ago but back then there was a much<br>more pressing challenge and that was<br>just to keep the babies alive as you can<br>see from that photo the main issues were<br>breathing and feeding when in 1916 only<br>fifteen percent of preterm babies<br>survived and over half died in the first<br>three days after birth in the next 50<br>years there was some progress but in<br>1963 when Patrick Kennedy was born<br>episode around 34 weeks gestation he<br>died two days after birth of respiratory<br>distress syndrome this was because at<br>that time in the u.s. there was no<br>treatment for babies like Patrick that<br>Patrick's death sparked new interest in<br>preterm birth and a neonatal nutrition<br>so today almost all babies like Patrick<br>survive in 2016 there are 15 million<br>preterm babies born each year that's one<br>in ten there's increased survival at<br>much lower gestational ages 23 to 24<br>weeks as the earliest and much lower<br>birth weights but preterm birth has<br>long-term effects on development and<br>disease risk so for example up to half<br>of the smallest preterm babies have some<br>form of neurodevelopmental impairment so<br>this may range from something quite mild<br>like needing to wear glasses to<br>something more severe like cerebral<br>palsy they also have an increased risk<br>of obesity diabetes and heart disease<br>and because this effects up to ten<br>percent of the population that means<br>it's a significant public<br>of concern but these long term effects<br>can be influenced by early nutrition<br>preterm birth has been described as a<br>nutritional emergency that's because<br>these babies have very low nutritional<br>stores and because they're very<br>challenging to feed especially in the<br>first few days after birth because there<br>are limits to the volume and<br>concentration of the fluids that they<br>can tolerate this means that they have a<br>very low energy in protein intake and<br>many preacher and babies grow poorly and<br>this affects their it increases their<br>risk of having small stature and having<br>effects on body composition and<br>long-term metabolic effects but most<br>importantly it can affect their brain<br>growth at a time when their brain is<br>growing faster than any other time in<br>the life cycle so that's from about 23<br>weeks gestation to 27 weeks and you can<br>see that even in the last five weeks of<br>pregnancy the brain increases in size by<br>about fifty percent a period of<br>nutritional deprivation like this is<br>often followed by rapid growth but<br>record growth also brings risks so there<br>may be a trade-off between development<br>and metabolic risk in this study of the<br>name in the 1980s of preterm infants<br>those who had faster linked growth in<br>the first four months after birth had a<br>decreased risk of having a low IQ but<br>they also had an increased risk of being<br>overweight or obese at eight and also at<br>eighteen years of age this may be<br>particularly important for boys because<br>preterm boys don't do as well as preteen<br>girls they have increased risk<br>death they tend to be sicker and so they<br>have longer stays in hospital and they<br>also have an increased risk of<br>neurodevelopmental impairment always<br>also seemed more susceptible to the<br>effects of sub optimal nutrition in the<br>early days and when we give them<br>nutritional supplementation they also<br>seem to have metabolic outcomes that<br>differ from girls and other times of<br>very rapid growth such as adolescents<br>boys have higher nutrient intakes in<br>particular protein than girls do but for<br>preterm infants we consider their<br>requirements to be exactly the same and<br>we prescribe the same nutrition for boys<br>and girls this graph shows the cognitive<br>scores of term born boys and girls at<br>six years of age and compares it with<br>preterm so you can see that the term<br>born boys and girls both have very<br>similar cognitive scores and that they<br>are higher than the babies the sexuality<br>that were born preterm but what we also<br>see there is that the boys have a lower<br>scores than the girls so it may be that<br>we need to be thinking about boys and<br>girls differently and perhaps even<br>feeding them differently in order to<br>achieve the same metabolic and<br>neurodevelopmental outcomes for boys as<br>we do for girls so we know that<br>nutrition and early life is a key<br>determinant of growth and long-term<br>health and that preventing these<br>deficits seems better than having<br>accelerated growth so the crucial<br>question is what is the energy and<br>protein intake that's needed to achieve<br>optimal growth and development and we<br>don't yet know the answer to that<br>question but here's what we're doing at<br>the legens Institute to find out we've<br>identified that nutritional and take in<br>the first week after birth is very<br>important for later growth so this graph<br>shows the protein intake<br>of a fetus in utero a baby during<br>pregnancy and that's followed by the<br>actual intake of a group of 50 extremely<br>low birth weight babies from what<br>consider hospital from an observational<br>study that we did over there this is the<br>intake that the babies over the road are<br>having right now extremely low birth<br>weight babies what you see inside that<br>red box could be described as a serious<br>nutritional insult editor at the time of<br>most rapid growth and the human life<br>cycle and especially the most rapid<br>brain growth so in perhaps in order to<br>achieve the growth for preaching babies<br>that would have occurred if they hadn't<br>been born preterm we need to be looking<br>at matching their intake that occurs<br>during pregnancy and this is the basis<br>of two studies that are being done at<br>the ligands Institute these studies are<br>both funded by the Health Research<br>Council the first is the divided the<br>diamond study which is a study and<br>looking at early nutrition and moderate<br>too late preterm infants those born at<br>32 to 36 weeks and the second one is the<br>provides study this is a study looking<br>at whether early nutrition intake in<br>particular early protein intake an<br>extremely low birth weight babies those<br>born with a birth weight of less than<br>one kilo whether that protein can<br>improve their neurodevelopment protein<br>is made up of chains of amino acids<br>these extremely low birth weight babies<br>that I've been talking about need to<br>have intervene asst nutritionist<br>nutrition via a drop in their first few<br>days after birth for about the first two<br>weeks actually because they're not able<br>to a mature to tolerate enough breast<br>milk to meet their requirements so we<br>give them nutrition Voyager up and this<br>is<br>a mixture of glucose and protein and fat<br>the protein and the central venous<br>nutrition is given as an amino acid<br>solution so the provides study is an<br>international multicenter double-blind<br>randomized conceived Oh controlled trial<br>of an extra one gram of intravenous<br>protein as am i no acid solution for the<br>first five days after birth this is like<br>a little protein chaser of an extra<br>thirty to fifty percent on top of the<br>intravenous protein that they are<br>already receiving so half the babies get<br>that extra protein and the other half<br>don't this extra protein has been given<br>by the humble o'cl arterial catheter and<br>that's the way of making sure that the<br>babies have that extra protein because<br>in previous studies it's been really<br>difficult to get much of a difference<br>between the two groups when giving some<br>higher protein and others the normal<br>amount of protein so the primary outcome<br>of the study is survival free from<br>neurodevelopmental impairment at two<br>years secondary outcomes are growth<br>clinical outcomes and body composition<br>what's unique about this study is the<br>sample size this will be the biggest<br>study that's ever been done looking at<br>this issue an extremely low birth weight<br>babies the study began in april 2014 and<br>all six level three neonatal units and<br>New Zealand are involved we've got two<br>Australian sites starting one next week<br>and one and a few weeks after that and<br>to date we have recruited actually 211<br>babies because there was another one<br>this afternoon which is still forty-nine<br>percent we've also just started the<br>two-year follow-up of the babies around<br>New Zealand and the first babies that we<br>were crucial<br>as part of the study we've been able to<br>get access to the newborn metabolic<br>screening results for these babies you<br>may know this is the gas we test and<br>this means that we can look at the amino<br>acid concentrations and the blood of the<br>babies we've got some preliminary<br>results which I'll show you for 119<br>babies at six sites all around New<br>Zealand and we have results available<br>for the amino acids that are listed on<br>the slide on the day of birth there was<br>no difference between the boys and the<br>girls for these are minor essence but on<br>day five these four amino acids were<br>higher in girls than they were in boys<br>which we think is very interesting built<br>our mono acids are the building blocks<br>of protein but they're also very<br>important because some regulate the key<br>metabolic pathways that are necessary<br>for repair growth and immune function<br>too little of one amino acid just one<br>can impair growth but too much of one<br>amino acid can be toxic to the<br>developing brain so it's very important<br>to have the right balance what we are<br>interested in is are the boys and girls<br>using the protein that we're giving them<br>differently and are the higher mine<br>Oasis too high or are the low ones too<br>low so whether these differences are<br>associated with short or long-term<br>outcome comes needs further<br>investigation and went in to do that as<br>so in summary preterm birth is a<br>nutritional emergent emergency that may<br>need to falter in growth and long-term<br>health effects and there's wide<br>variation around the country and<br>nutritional intakes and those effects<br>between sexes the provide study will<br>find will provide the first direct<br>evidence of whether more protein is<br>better for extremely low birth weight<br>babies and perhaps whether it's<br>beautiful boys or for girls or for both<br>and it's a simple and expense of<br>intervention there if it's found to be<br>beneficial could easily be implemented<br>all around the world there's still a lot<br>that we don't know about preterm babies<br>but this research has the potential to<br>answer at least one of the really<br>important questions before another 100<br>years goes by and I'd like to<br>acknowledge and thank all of the people<br>listed on that slide thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
