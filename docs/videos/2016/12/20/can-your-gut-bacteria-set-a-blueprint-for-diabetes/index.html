This is particularly apparent in preterm children who are more likely to become obese or to develop diabetes and heart disease in later life. In this fascinating presentation, PhD candidate Thilini Maddegoda Vidanelage will explain how the microbiome differs in pre and full-term babies, and why this affects insulin resistance.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we humans are a complex ecosystem that<br>consist of microorganisms such as<br>bacteria virus fungi and our own cells<br>so these microorganisms live in us they<br>live on and around us and they<br>contribute to make who we are if we<br>compare the microbial cells to our own<br>cells we have more microbial cells in<br>our body compared to our own cells as<br>far as the genes are concerned we have<br>more microbial genes compared to our own<br>genes therefore these microorganisms are<br>very important and they play a very<br>critical role in our health and<br>diseases so we first get main dose of<br>microorganisms at the time of birth and<br>factors like U type of delivery type of<br>feeding and environment antibiotics<br>illnesses they all contribute to make<br>the make the microbiome profile in the<br>early stages of life until age of 3<br>years our microbiome changes a lot and<br>it becomes more stable and represent<br>adult like microbiome at the age of 3<br>years therefore early life microbiome<br>development is very important factor<br>which determines our health and diseases<br>sometimes unfortunately adverse life<br>events in early life can have a negative<br>impact in the health and development so<br>one such early life adverse event is<br>pre-term birth pre-term birth is a<br>common event and pre-term babies are the<br>babies who are born at less than 37<br>weeks of gastral age in our research we<br>mainly focus on the children who were<br>born at less than 32 weeks of gastal age<br>they the children who were born at very<br>pre- term so these children have higher<br>risk for the development of of um<br>adverse metabolic<br>profiles so 12 years ago in 2004<br>Professor Paul Hoffman and Professor<br>Wayne cutfield and the research Group<br>found that in very pre-term children<br>insulin works less compared to term<br>children so we know insulin is a hormone<br>which is important to reduce our blood<br>glucose level so in this children they<br>had reduced insulin sensitivity and when<br>these these children become older they<br>have higher risk for the diabetes blood<br>pressure high blood pressure bad lipid<br>profiles and obesity leading to the risk<br>of having cardiometabolic<br>diseases some of the factors like<br>intravenous nutrition dietary<br>fortification infections diseases<br>antibiotic medicines like steroids in<br>early life stages of these free term<br>children can be implicated in the<br>development of these adverse event<br>adverse Med syic profiles however still<br>we don't know what causes exactly these<br>children just after the birth of these<br>pre-term babies they have delayed and<br>altered gut<br>colonization however little is known<br>about the microbiome development when<br>they become older so in our research we<br>ask three questions one whether these<br>children have less insulin sensitivity<br>compared to term children secondly we<br>ask whether these children have<br>different bacteria in their gut compared<br>to term children and thirdly do these<br>children have bacteria who um and these<br>bacteria do different things in the gut<br>of these pre-term children compared to<br>term children so to answer these<br>research questions we recruited 50<br>children who were born at very pre-term<br>and 51 term children at the mean age of<br>7.5 years we collected data such as<br>weight height insulin sensitivity blood<br>pressure fat and muscle mass diet and<br>physical<br>activity so as I mentioned before we<br>were interested in looking at their gut<br>microbial composition and the activity<br>for that we collected fresh stool<br>samples from these kids and I extracted<br>the genetic<br>materials microbial genetic materials<br>such as RNA and DNA with this particular<br>technique called Next Generation<br>sequencing I sequenc these genetic<br>materials and found which microbes are<br>present in the gut of these children and<br>what these microbes are doing in these<br>children so from the data that we<br>collected we could not see any<br>difference between preterm and term<br>group in terms of sex ratio weight<br>height BMI total body fat percentage<br>blood pressure and lipids<br>however when we looked at the look at<br>how insulin Works in these pre-term<br>children we found that in our cohort<br>very pre-term children have reduced<br>insulin sensitivity compared to term<br>children and this data is consistent<br>with the previous<br>findings then we looked at the bacterial<br>population in these children then we<br>found that this particular microorganism<br>called privot cpri is is higher in<br>pre-term group compared to term group so<br>prel laoi percentage is more than double<br>the percentage of um priot cpri in term<br>group so in the literature it has been<br>found that this priot cpri is associated<br>with glucose intolerance and<br>diabetes then we looked at the Active<br>bacteria in these um children so as you<br>can see the bacteria which are highly<br>present in Pre pre-term children are<br>shown in green bars and the bacteria<br>which are highly present in term group<br>are shown in red bars so in this<br>pre-term group they have higher uh<br>percent higher number of Colin species<br>and some other related species and they<br>are associated with adverse lipid<br>profile and impaired glucose metabolism<br>and some of the species for an example<br>alisp species which are highly present<br>in term group are associated with<br>protein Rich diet so then we wanted to<br>look at their diet and see whether<br>there's any difference in the diet in<br>these two groups when we looked at the<br>diet we could not see any difference<br>between preterm group and the term group<br>in terms of di dietary<br>parameters so then we looked at the<br>bacterial activity in these children so<br>as you can see although there are<br>different bacterial activities different<br>between groups we mainly observed that<br>this Arginine biosynthesis pathways are<br>highly expressed in pre-term group<br>group arginine is an amino acid and it<br>is important for several metabolic<br>functions in our body for an example<br>arginine is is a precursor and it is<br>important to synthesize nitric oxide and<br>Arginine and nitric oxide pathway is<br>important for some of the functions of<br>insulin in type two diabetic patients it<br>has been found that this Arginine and<br>nitric oxide pathway is impaired so this<br>gives us a clue that in our group in<br>these very pre-term children higher<br>expression of arginine biosynthesis<br>pathway can be linked with the adverse<br>metabolic profile however we still don't<br>know the<br>mechanisms so from the DAT data that we<br>have so far we can conclude that these<br>pre-term children have reduced insulin<br>sensitivity and yes they also have<br>different bacteria and they have these<br>bacteria are doing different things<br>compared to term<br>children so what is next so it's very<br>interesting to F follow up these<br>children and see how their microbiome<br>changes over the time how these<br>microbial activities are going to be<br>changed over the time but then we have<br>to wait for that so in this particular<br>study a temporal and discrete samp tool<br>samples have shown that in healthy<br>individuals over a 5year period of time<br>50 to 60% of uh bacterial St strains<br>stays same so it is clear that<br>environmental and developmental factors<br>can shape up our<br>microbiome however there is less<br>information about the microbial<br>stability in an individual over a very<br>long period of time so in that regard we<br>got very go great opportunity to analyze<br>the stool samples from the famous artist<br>U Billy Apple from the stool samples<br>present in toilet tissues collected in<br>1970 and 2016 so we analyzed those<br>samples and found that 55% of microbial<br>strains remain same after 46 years and<br>this is very interesting and this data<br>is U consistent with the the previous<br>predictions so although Billy has been<br>living in different countries and it's<br>been exposed into different environment<br>having different diets this gives us<br>information that there is a genetic<br>component which can play a role in<br>maintaining and in selecting M microbial<br>composition in B samples so with that I<br>would like to um conclude my<br>presentation acknowledging my research<br>team my supervisors Professor way<br>Heartfield and Dr Justin oan and all<br>other research team members<br>collaborators funding bodies last but<br>not least all the children and their<br>families who gave the wonderful<br>contribution to our study thank you very</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
