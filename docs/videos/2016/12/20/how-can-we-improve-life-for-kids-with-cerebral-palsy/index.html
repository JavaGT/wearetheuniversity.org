Cerebral palsy affects movement control which over the years impacts muscle and bone health. However, in a unique trial at the Liggins Instituteâ€™s Clinical Research Unit, research fellow Dr Silmara Gusso discovered huge improvements in children with cerebral palsy who used a vibration plate for just a few minutes a day. In this presentation she explains how the clinical trial worked and some of the biggest breakthroughs for participants.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

conducting several<br>clinical trials looking at the impact of<br>vibration therapy on the mouth seven<br>bones of those with masses collateral<br>disability and today i'll be showing<br>briefly the results of our first study<br>in which we look at a group of<br>adolescents with zero palsy so for those<br>who are unaware cerebral pulse is the<br>most common disability in childhood and<br>we can define it as a disorder of<br>movement and posture due to a static<br>lesion of the developing brain that can<br>happen before during or shortly after<br>birth so is that insult or injury on the<br>brain that does not change over time<br>however the health outcomes consequence<br>of it they do change and they tend to<br>become worse over the years so the<br>health impact varies and it depends from<br>individual to individual but it's<br>commonly seen that affects muscle tone<br>muscle control and coordination on those<br>kids and this leads to muscle tightness<br>or is passed over their life involuntary<br>movements and also disturbance on their<br>gait in mobility and that leads to<br>reduction on their muscle mass and also<br>decreases on their muscle strength which<br>can lead to abnormalities on their bone<br>structure therefore they have an<br>increased risk for bone fractures and<br>it's not only that they also they're<br>both several surgical procedures over<br>their life they have Botox therapy they<br>have tender lengthening they have bone<br>lengthening and they all require casting<br>and if anyone in the audience ever broke<br>a bone you know that once you cast it<br>and you remove the cast after a period<br>of time your muscle is quite small in<br>their area so you have a reduction on<br>your muscle mass so these children they<br>are in a cycle of events that doesn't<br>actually optimize the health of their<br>muscle and bones over their life and<br>unfortunately there is very limited<br>evidence for<br>effective non-invasive treatments or<br>interventions to help them to improve<br>their bone mass therefore we are trying<br>to see if vibration therapy can assist<br>with that and helping their muscle and<br>their bones I knows with cerebral palsy<br>and musculoskeletal disability so why<br>we're using vibration therapy well it's<br>very easy to use it's non-invasive and<br>it has a relatively low cost the<br>equipment we use cost around 6000 New<br>Zealand dollars so it's very expensive<br>for one individual when you have several<br>time using it over time actually becomes<br>a little bit more cost benefit and<br>several research over the last 10 years<br>have showed that actually vibration to<br>help we can improve bone mass can<br>improve muscle mass and also masses<br>thread in a diverse range of populations<br>however very few studies actually had a<br>look at those with cerebral palsy and<br>most of these studies they are very<br>small or they actually have very<br>difficult methodology or the<br>interpretation of the results as I'll<br>make it very hard to understand what was<br>the finding that they overcame so how<br>does it work with this machine well you<br>stand on it<br>it is a sight alternating plate so it's<br>a seesaw of movement but it is a very<br>fast movement it's very fast and it<br>moves in a very low amplitude so it's<br>not a huge seesaw it's a very tiny<br>seesaw and with that movement you have a<br>little bit of a tilt in your hip during<br>that decline on the plate it's like when<br>we're walking<br>it's participating like copying the<br>movement of walking and that triggers a<br>contraction with the opposite side that<br>tilted so all the muscles in that area<br>will contract so you're constantly<br>contracting relaxing your muscles<br>without having an idea that you are<br>doing that so basically it's working<br>with this stretch reflex complex that we<br>mentioned so you're contracting your<br>muscle sending a message to your spine<br>saying hey you know you're losing your<br>balance<br>contract the other side otherwise you<br>could have fall and that is doing it in<br>a very small and delicate contraction so<br>the gross motor function has<br>gatien system it's a way to define the<br>motor skills of a child and they are<br>used by doctors and physiotherapists to<br>actually help to identify the needs of<br>their child not only now but also for<br>their future care and because we have a<br>huge range of health outcomes with zero<br>cosmos as collateral durability they<br>divide them in a group of five hour<br>studies they focus on those with mild to<br>severe cerebral palsy so they go from<br>level two three and four and the study<br>are presenting today for you are those<br>from level two and three the inclusion<br>criteria and exclusive varies from study<br>to study so I won't get on the details<br>for you but this first initial and<br>photos on your left they show<br>participants ther consider level two on<br>their gross motor function so our first<br>study was published at the beginning of<br>this year and involved for adolescents<br>with mild to moderate 0po palsy so the<br>gross motor function two and three and<br>they have an average of 16 years of age<br>so very good teenager bunch over there<br>and what was interested in that that<br>compliance actually was quite good they<br>did on overall 74% of your sessions and<br>we take back to Patricia Co that was<br>actually making sure that they are doing<br>it all the time for teenagers that's<br>quite good the design is simple is the<br>one like studies of all the participants<br>that come they do their assessments then<br>they go and take the vibration tag for<br>the period of time of the study and then<br>we do the post assessments on them they<br>can do the vibration or they did the<br>vibration at school or at home and they<br>did that in the specific study for 20<br>weeks so approximately five months and<br>they needed to do it four times a week<br>each day they could choose and they need<br>to do it only nine minutes a day of<br>vibration therapy so we'd stand in this<br>fight for three minutes<br>rest a little bit three minutes rest a<br>bit three minutes rest of it in the<br>assessments they did included a<br>six-minute walk test some of you might<br>have done it before basically walk<br>between two cones<br>the distance you walk during the period<br>of time we also did some body<br>composition scans to see how much muscle<br>mass and bone density they had it in<br>different parts of the body we use a CT<br>scan circle a little bit more details of<br>their bone health and their muscle<br>health and we also look at the muscle<br>function on daily activities using a<br>power plate and we use that to measure<br>the power and force generating<br>activities such as standing from a chair<br>or balancing both feet or maybe trying<br>to jump and what we saw after 20 weeks<br>or five months well we noticed a change<br>in the mobility but a mobility measured<br>by the six-minute walk test so in this<br>graph I haven't read the results of the<br>initial assessment of the kids and in<br>blue their final assessment and this<br>first graph is the results from the<br>children there were mild consider Maya<br>in mobility so they're actually quite<br>functional for those on level two and<br>they improve it by the end of the<br>training approximately 15% on the<br>distance that they achieved at the end<br>so that was quite remarkable for them<br>without adding anything else to their<br>physiotherapy core care of his core<br>activities but what impresses the most<br>was like the group that was actually<br>moderate to regarding their motor<br>function had a greater improvement they<br>improved by approximately 35% the<br>walking distance so these are trends of<br>children that couldn't even walk to up<br>to 50 meters and now they are walking up<br>to 100 or 150 meters so that tells us<br>that perhaps those that with more severe<br>disability might benefit the most but we<br>still need to investigate further so<br>besides the changes on the six-minute<br>walk test we also noticed from our scans<br>that they improved their bone mass and<br>density and we look at that in areas<br>such as spine and lower limbs and also<br>they put it on muscle approximately 800<br>grams so almost a kilo of muscle mass on<br>their body and also we noticed that they<br>decreased the time required for example<br>to stand up from sitting they were doing<br>that faster more efficiently and also<br>the time to walk from wait for me so<br>quite positive results for that specific<br>group which was already quite mobile to<br>start with<br>but what surprised me the most actual is<br>feedback from families participants and<br>physiotherapists I enjoy hearing from<br>them they experienced what they were<br>feeling it and how they were enjoying<br>the experience both physiotherapy<br>schools moms and family I just put it a<br>few of them here but they were always<br>saying that it could notice the small<br>changes on their daily activities or<br>actually at school functions and<br>training or feeling basically they were<br>feeling a little bit happier as well in<br>what the future brings a lot of work I<br>hope we still need to identify what's<br>the most effective protocol to use and<br>this equipment who actually benefit the<br>most not everybody will benefit the same<br>way also when should we start it is in<br>this population we are trying to plan to<br>start next year study actually starting<br>with kids they're the younger as five<br>years old so we're seeing what's the<br>best age to start we need to create<br>guidelines for the use of this equipment<br>and also maybe start implementing them<br>on the physiotherapy plans of<br>individuals so a lot of work coming up<br>and I wouldn't have done anything of<br>this and I wouldn't be here working for<br>the last four years if it wasn't for the<br>support from the Jubilee crippled<br>children Foundation Trust which had been<br>supporting financially the staff working<br>to study now so our daily runnings and<br>also I would like to take this a David<br>Levine foundation they supported us on<br>buying all the plates we have for the<br>study and also the Power Plate again we<br>are very grateful for their support we<br>wouldn't have done any of these studies<br>without their assistance we are a small<br>group but very fun one to work with we<br>have professor Paul Hoffman miss<br>Patricia code that is always running<br>between schools driving all around<br>Auckland and she's really good and kept<br>the kids on track mr. gene beads that is<br>always helping us with the assessments<br>and behind the scenes and Jersey the<br>rock that is always helping us with a<br>final writing and summary of our results<br>but I think the most important people<br>those actually doing the studies being<br>involved their families the schools the<br>physiotherapist without them I wouldn't<br>be here and I think with that I'll<br>finish my presentation and thank you for<br>your attention<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
