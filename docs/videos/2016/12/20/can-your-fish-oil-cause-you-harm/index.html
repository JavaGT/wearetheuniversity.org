He’s already found more than half of the fish-oil brands sold in New Zealand are “off” by the time we buy them, but 20% of women take fish oil supplements during pregnancy to boost their baby’s brain development. In this presentation, Ben explains how tests on rats have found higher newborn mortality rates and increased maternal insulin resistance in those fed oxidised fish oil.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

public<br>audience so I'm very grateful that<br>you're all there and I have this<br>opportunity and what I'm going to do is<br>tell you first a little bit about the<br>Mega 3 fats then a little bit about how<br>obesity leads to disease and then I'll<br>take you through some of the work that<br>I've done during my PhD so Omega 3 fats<br>they're a type of unsaturated fat that<br>our bodies cannot make we have to<br>consume them if we want to increase the<br>amount in our bodies and they have<br>effects on the body that are different<br>to the other unsaturated fats or the<br>saturated ones the main sources of<br>omega-3 are from the sea and fish crow<br>and algae are the main sources and you<br>can get them from eating those or from<br>oils made from them<br>however these molecules are also highly<br>reactive which means that they go off or<br>oxidize very easily during storage the<br>main reason that people taken mega<br>threes either to prevent heart attacks<br>cardiovascular disease or during<br>pregnancy there I've been taking with<br>the hope of improving the intelligence<br>of the child and it would have to be<br>said that in the last 10 years both of<br>these have really not born be born<br>Allison and most of the studies<br>nevertheless there's still the main<br>reason people take them and they're<br>taken by a lot of people about 17% of<br>Americans in one study and 20% of<br>pregnant women in New Zealand now<br>everyone will be well aware that obesity<br>is a massive problem for us it's a<br>global problem there are now 500 million<br>obese people in the world and New<br>Zealand has a big problem with us as<br>well more than half of the population is<br>now either overweight or obese the<br>reason this is important is because<br>obesity leads to higher blood pressure<br>at least role in the development of<br>diabetes and together these lead to<br>cardiovascular disease which are the<br>biggest killer in this country<br>importantly the underlying problem<br>that's linking obesity to these problems<br>is that insulin the hormone that<br>controls your blood sugar doesn't work<br>as well if you're overweight or obese<br>a very special group that we should<br>think about as well as women who are<br>pregnant<br>we know that the offspring of women who<br>are obese while they're pregnant are<br>more likely to become obese themselves<br>have a high rate of diabetes and<br>metabolic problems as they age and this<br>too is probably because insulin is not<br>working very well in mum that leads to<br>her to have higher blood sugars and pets<br>that cross the placenta and have a long<br>term effects on the baby so this raises<br>the possibility that an insulin<br>sensitizing treatments one that makes<br>insulin work better could have a<br>dramatic impact on these populations now<br>could omega-3 fats be this treatment<br>well in mice and rats treatment with<br>omega-3 fats does restore insulin<br>function and so that's what we've got<br>excited about and why we've done the<br>research that I'm going to describe<br>we've had four really important research<br>questions the first is that could a mega<br>3 supplements improve how insulin works<br>and people who are overweight or obese<br>second is if we gave them mega 3 fats to<br>obese mothers could we improve the<br>health of their offspring as they age we<br>also wanted to know our omega-3<br>supplements offer at the time we<br>purchased by consumers and does that<br>make a difference to how they work so<br>please follow me down the rabbit hole<br>so first are these supplements oxidized<br>when you buy them<br>the short answer today is yes I surveyed<br>most of the omega-3 products on a New<br>Zealand market and I measured how<br>oxidized they were using a standard test<br>and this dotted line represents the<br>recommended level of observation you can<br>see that almost every product exceeded<br>that in some way a large degree now what<br>does that mean for people taking them<br>we're not sure that dotted line is<br>actually the dotted line for whether<br>that where tastes bad or not not for<br>whether it changes its function so it's<br>a really important question to us given<br>that everyone is taking oxidized audible<br>the next question is could we use an<br>Amiga 3 supplement to improve how<br>insulin works and people who are<br>overweight or obese to find this out we<br>enrolled overweight middle-aged men into<br>a trial and we randomized them to<br>receive one of two treatments a curl<br>based omega-3 supplement which is a<br>small crustacean fished up in the sea or<br>a controlled oil and they took the<br>supplement for eight weeks we assist<br>them in terrorism before and afterwards<br>and then they had a break it took the<br>other supplement so they didn't know<br>what they're taking at each time but<br>every person got both supplements and<br>it's worth pointing out that neither of<br>the oils been used for oxidized they<br>can't explain our findings so the first<br>thing we found was that at the start of<br>the trial before anyone had taken any<br>krill oil those who had more omega-3 in<br>their blood insulin worked far better<br>and new bodies those with the lowest<br>level insulin wasn't working very well<br>and it was quite a big difference so<br>that so far so good<br>however when we gave them krill oil we<br>actually found that their insulin seems<br>to be got worse<br>insulin wasn't working as well as it was<br>before we gave the krill oil and it's<br>actually quite a large effect this<br>suggests that if these men took this for<br>years it might have increased their risk<br>of diabetes or cardiovascular disease<br>how did this happen why we don't<br>actually know it's probably not due to<br>the immediate three fifths in the curl<br>we think it's probably another compound<br>that's unique to curl and probably not<br>found in fish supporting that a recent<br>study from Europe has shown that giving<br>a purified Amiga 3 supplement improved<br>insulin action and reduce the<br>development of diabetes and adults so it<br>looks like Amiga 3 probably is good for<br>metabolism but that krill is not the way<br>to get it the next question we had was<br>could we use fish oil and the offspring<br>of obese mothers to prevent them<br>now the first test of us we had to do it<br>in animals and the reason for that is<br>because if we do an intervention and<br>mothers and have to wait for their<br>children to grow up to be assessed that<br>takes years and years and so the first<br>study was done in rats what we did was<br>we assigned some pregnant some female<br>rats to a normal diet and some to a<br>high-fat diet we know that a high fat<br>diet pregnancy is similar to in our<br>biggest pregnancy and that the offspring<br>still become obese and they get problems<br>with how insulin works and so the rats<br>took those those diets after we mated<br>they continued on them and then we gave<br>them an extra treatment which was either<br>fish oil or water which was our control<br>and what we're aiming to do is see if by<br>giving that fish oil to the high-fat<br>groups we could prevent this problem<br>with insulin action once the offspring<br>were born<br>they feed an ordinary with their<br>daughter he died for their whole lives<br>as much as they wanted to eat and we<br>assist them and adulthood so the only<br>thing we did was change what mum had<br>during pregnancy we also added one more<br>group which makes it much more<br>complicated and what we did here was we<br>took some of our very fresh fish oil and<br>we oxidized it so that we had in oil<br>that was identical except that it was<br>oxidized so what happened when we did<br>this well the first thing was dramatic<br>and completely unexpected once the pup<br>started to get born and the group whose<br>mother had a head outside<br>fish oil we saw an incredible rate of<br>death almost a third of those pups died<br>very soon after being born but it didn't<br>happen in the fresh fish or group which<br>tells us it was the fact that it was<br>oxidized that mattered and we don't know<br>quite why they happen we didn't expect<br>it so he didn't do the right tests to<br>find that out those that survived were<br>often different to other animals as well<br>and so this little guy makes to a rep<br>from different group there's about a<br>third the size and he didn't move<br>normally either um that's where I'll<br>stop talking about the oxidized groups<br>this was featured in the listener<br>earlier in the year as well and quite an<br>in-depth article but what happened to<br>the other animals what this graph shows<br>is how they gained weight from from<br>early life through to adulthood and<br>high-fat diet means the mum had the high<br>fat diet<br>remember that offspring did exactly the<br>same thing now this finding isn't new<br>but it kind of blows my mind I think<br>this is amazing by changing mums<br>nutrition in this very small window<br>we've had a permanent effect on this<br>offspring<br>it's amazing now what happened when we<br>added for soil to this in terms of<br>weight nothing the high fat diet groups<br>still became obese but there was one<br>very important difference and that was<br>an insulin action so what you can see on<br>this graph is if mum had an ordinary<br>diet the offspring are nice and insulin<br>sensitive if mum had a high-fat diet<br>they are much less sensitive it's a<br>bigger fit but if we added fish oil to<br>that we completely prevented that and so<br>we had obese animals that were more<br>metabolically well and that would still<br>be an outcome that would be very<br>favorable if it could carry through to<br>humans now what does a response to this<br>quite shocking a hint of the oxidized<br>oil the dose we used was high it was<br>more oxidized than what's on the market<br>and it's clear that women taking<br>official in pregnancy I'm not having a<br>look the babies die but if they were<br>more subtle of digs on things like<br>growth we might not know about that<br>because it's not been looked in our<br>approach to this now is to say look<br>there is no compelling reason for women<br>to take fish oil in pregnancy and we<br>know if they buy it and will probably be<br>oxidized so women who have pregnant<br>probably shouldn't take fish oil and<br>should get their omega-3 from fish<br>saying that woman who have been taking<br>fish or have probably not Joanie babies<br>huh and we're sue from here there's two<br>studies which we're designing and<br>looking for funding for the first is a<br>careful study in rape pregnancy using<br>doses of oxidized for sure better<br>relevant to a woman the try to better<br>estimate the risk of a woman taking fish<br>oil and we're working with the Ministry<br>of Primary Industries and a toxicologist<br>that designed the sort of study the<br>government would listen to the second<br>thing is a human trial of using a very<br>fresh fish oil during the pregnancy of<br>women who are obese to see if we really<br>can affect the health of their children<br>as they grow up and if we can do this<br>I'm going to be very busy so um I've<br>made it sound like all of my work was<br>solely my own and of course it wasn't it<br>takes a village of people assisting and<br>I'm very grateful to those people thank<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
