University of Otago podcast<br>tena koe toe tena koutou tena koutou<br>katoa my name is Helen Nicholson the<br>deputy vice-chancellor external<br>engagement and it's my great pleasure to<br>welcome you all to this occasion of<br>Colin brands inaugural professorial<br>lecture I'd like to extend a warm<br>welcome to all friends and particularly<br>Collins family his wife and two boys mar<br>Neil and Alex and we were looking<br>forward to an exciting lecture being<br>promoted to professor within the<br>University of Otago is no mean feat in<br>order to be promoted an individual has<br>to show sustained outstanding competence<br>in teaching in research and also in<br>service added to that they have to show<br>outstanding leadership in two of the<br>three areas colin is an accomplished<br>teacher and has been deputy head<br>research in the department of physiology<br>for over two years he's also as you<br>shall hear a strong researcher as one of<br>his external referees said during the<br>promotion's process colin is a leading<br>international figure in yer<br>endocrinology and a much liked and<br>admired member of our research community<br>as a previous dean of the OS ms I've<br>taken an interest in Colin's progress<br>since he arrived in 2005 both within the<br>University and the consequences of his<br>escapades on the soccer field as someone<br>whose research career began with an<br>honest project looking at oxytocin in<br>the brain I'm looking forward to hearing<br>Collins lecture and but before we do<br>before we give colin a chance to speak<br>I'd like to hand over to Professor<br>Vernon board the current dean of the<br>school of medical sciences to give us<br>tena koe tu camino a 10-acre cat welcome<br>everybody I have the very distinct<br>pleasure of being able to introduce<br>Colin for his inaugural professorial<br>lecture I think most of you know Colin<br>but for those of you who don't you will<br>work out very very quickly that he is a<br>Scotsman and probably comes as no<br>surprise then that if you look at<br>Collins background he got his bachelor<br>of science with honors from the<br>University of Glasgow and I'm going to<br>give you the date it was 1988 and then<br>he followed that up by receiving a<br>university scholarship again at the<br>University of Glasgow where he took on a<br>PhD in yer endocrinology so he's been<br>working in this field for some time he<br>received his PhD in 1993 before moving<br>on sitting another 12 years as a<br>research fellow and undertaking research<br>in edinboro and I go and before you then<br>came as professor Helen Nicholson has<br>mentioned to the department of<br>physiology here at the University Otago<br>in 2005 probably is no surprise to you<br>that is a member of the Center for<br>neuroendocrinology and he's also a<br>member of the brain health research<br>center top of our real flagship centers<br>for this university and an integral part<br>of them his research expertise again<br>follows down his near endocrinology path<br>that's clearly neuroendocrinology this<br>reproduction neuroscience a lot of<br>electrophysiology and I think you'll see<br>all the real schools and techniques and<br>knowledge that goes with those fields as<br>we know you have to be strong and<br>research along with the other skills of<br>service and teaching and order to become<br>a professor so this is an oral<br>professorial lecturer I'll focus a<br>little bit on his research which is he's<br>got extended research funding right now<br>he's a COPI I on an HR c5n dollar<br>program grant Skopje I met he said<br>funding from Marsden lottery health and<br>in the past and Wellcome Trust so he's<br>being well funded is close to 70<br>research publications some of the<br>highlights from that would be neuron and<br>for those of you that like to count such<br>things that's an impact factor 16 which<br>we all think is fairly good journal of<br>physiology neuropharmacology<br>endocrinology journal of neuroscience<br>all good strong core journals and has<br>discipline<br>as already mentioned the service<br>involvement is strong and around deputy<br>head research for the department of<br>physiology is also on the Otago pprs<br>steering committee which is quite an<br>important role his list of memberships<br>of societies as long his contribution to<br>them as extensive and he's a senior<br>editor for The Journal of nearly<br>neuroendocrinology so he's well rounded<br>so his promotion is very well deserved<br>now I also have to give a little brief<br>introduction to his talk without trying<br>to steal his thunder and so as talk is<br>oxytocin neurons keys to unlocking brain<br>function so that's calling a little bit<br>about his presentation I think what he's<br>looking to do here is develop a little<br>theme along the way of today's talk a<br>simple quiz to work out basic science of<br>how a system actually works and then<br>that leads the fundamental discoveries I<br>think it's something many of us aspire<br>to then you take those discoveries and<br>you have the potential have a direct<br>impact on clinical practice and for<br>those of us that do research I think<br>that would be enough wonderfully outcome<br>to know that your research had an impact<br>out in the real world and so what he's<br>going to talk about today as a path and<br>it's going to looking at the<br>identification of a previously unknown<br>mechanism that might control birth and<br>then the says the potential to lead on<br>to new types of drug controlling things<br>like preterm births getting better drugs<br>that sort of work so I don't want to<br>take anything away from his presentation<br>by going on any longer so at this point<br>I would like to invite professor Brown<br>to present as a normal professorial<br>lecture nor a Latina to me he Kyoko<br>so I thank you for the painting done<br>trucks in Berlin I'm not sure I<br>recognize the person you're the stratum<br>there but we'll go with it so as well<br>and said what I'm going to try and do<br>tonight is take you through the Johnny<br>that I've been on through my research<br>career so that started as well and said<br>with the basic question under Stan one<br>thing about how one particular brain<br>cell works and has that team is going<br>through and been explained it have gone<br>on so where I'm going to start is just<br>on communication in the brain so this<br>thing this little squiggle represents<br>the mechanism by which brain cells or<br>neurons talk to each other it's called<br>an action potential so this shows the<br>voltage measured from an individual<br>brain cell an ox ocean you're on<br>actually it's a recording I need<br>personally about 18 years ago and this<br>is the way that brain cells communicate<br>with each other so they send a little<br>impulses and when you watch CSI and the<br>light and they saw those little lights<br>flashing inside the brain this is what<br>they're trying to represent these<br>electrical impulses but what we don't<br>know is what those impulses are actually<br>seeing what's the message they're giving<br>little halo doing it or what's the<br>message that's because there are lots of<br>things going on difficult to identify<br>individual cell types to Newport what<br>they're doing and what's happening<br>inside the beam doesn't fit very well<br>what we see in the real world so this is<br>a real world communication anybody want<br>to hazard a guess what i'm showing or<br>someone's got to see something laid off<br>i can eat it okay so this is pretty much<br>how I'm feeling right now SOS SOS SOS<br>but the illustration here is actually<br>fundamental to our understanding of how<br>the brain functions boss Court is<br>first dots and dashes so you can<br>summarize the sum total of human<br>knowledge with only two symbols those of<br>you who aren't quite as all to me might<br>recognize this kind of representation of<br>information binary record from computers<br>zeros and ones and again these zeros and<br>ones on their own don't confer any<br>information whatsoever what matters is<br>how they appear in the sequence with all<br>of the other zeros and ones sonus ascii<br>code 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 so this one means<br>absolutely nothing unless you can see<br>what's happening on either side of it<br>and put the the individual what that<br>that number is representing into context<br>with everything else around it so now<br>what we can see is action potentials a<br>car in sequences these electrical<br>impulses these signals that communicate<br>from one brain cell to another bean cell<br>occurrence sequences different sequences<br>for different types of being cell what<br>hope you can look at now is look and see<br>that these intervals are different and<br>if you know translate these action<br>potentials and think of them as if<br>you're late is an upstate and the<br>baseline membrane potential has the Dana<br>state or those zeros and ones you can<br>start to coord the information so it's<br>not the occurrence of a single action<br>potential that means anything it's part<br>happens in that sequence so of course<br>this is easy when you've got one sale<br>and you can see what's going on with<br>that one sale but the brain is<br>incredibly complex if I not sure I'll<br>get bill shields court correctly but<br>it's the most complex thing in the known<br>universe and that's where our trouble<br>comes is how do you how do you decipher<br>those messages when you don't<br>what's going on it was in and it comes<br>out so this is where we apply a<br>scientific scientific method<br>reductionism contract the system to a<br>manageable abate sized piece of system<br>and this is my favorite model of being<br>function is the one that I came to euro<br>science with I was chained in you in<br>actually in physiology and my<br>neuroscience training was always util<br>within that physiology degree so you<br>have sensory information comes in at one<br>end and hopefully the appropriate<br>response comes out at the other end and<br>something magical and mystical happens<br>in between and that something magical<br>mystical usually involves complex<br>networks or green cells that communicate<br>with each other and this is where<br>neuroendocrine systems come in so for<br>this particular set brain cells that I'm<br>interested in we actually know what the<br>input is so for these brain cells they<br>respond to the baby suckling at the<br>nipple during lactation and the response<br>is to deliver milk to the suckling baby<br>to say she ate the hungry child and the<br>bit in the middle boils down to these<br>oxytocin sales oxytocin neurons so these<br>are specialized brain cells that like<br>all other neurons sit inside the brain<br>receive lots of inputs but instead of<br>making connections with other brain<br>cells they send their projection to a<br>specialized line called the posterior<br>pituitary gland and secrete the oxytocin<br>into the bloodstream so the noodle<br>endocrine noodle because the brain cells<br>and endocrine because they actually<br>secrete a hormone rather than I<br>transmitted within the brain so we can<br>understand what the purpose of the<br>activity of these neurons is quite<br>readily<br>and this measure is those action<br>potentials fighting in a different way<br>so this is no no longer the voltage<br>measurements from a single cell but the<br>translation of those occurrences of<br>those action potentials into a firing<br>rate so this is spikes per second or<br>helps on the y-axis and a time in<br>minutes on the x-axis and what you can<br>see is that mostly retain this ox tools<br>and seller just bumbling along being<br>nothing particularly spectacular and<br>then once every few minutes is this very<br>high frequency bus of acts potentials<br>and that bust of action potentials<br>releases a pulse of oxytocin into the<br>bloodstream and that pulse of oxytocin<br>travels around the body and causes<br>contraction of the muscle cells in the<br>milk ducts which then causes the<br>delivery of the milk to the suckling<br>baby it's not the only thing oxytocin<br>does it's actually also required for<br>normal birth and essentially a law the<br>stimulus and the outcome of different<br>the processing in the brain appears to<br>be indistinguishable so the two things<br>that oxytocin is doing is essentially<br>getting your baby delivered and keeping<br>it alive once it's delivered so we know<br>what's going on at this level and<br>actually we've known everything I'm<br>showing just now was textbook physiology<br>by the time I started my undergraduate<br>degree in 1983 so we've no one else goes<br>on but actually we don't know how this<br>happens because if you think about it<br>baby suckling at the nipple is<br>continuous stimulus the baby latches on<br>suckles all the time and somehow the<br>brain is taking that continuous signal<br>and transforming it into this episodic<br>output these busts of activity in these<br>cells that cause the pulsatile secretion<br>of the hormone<br>and that is processed at the level of<br>the Ox tools and sales and sales so can<br>we look at the activity of the bean<br>sales in the network around them that<br>looks random even when there is suckling<br>of the baby oxytocin of course is far<br>more important than that I see David<br>Granton arrived late well done Dave Dave<br>tries to persuade everybody in the<br>planet that prolactin is the most<br>important hormone in the world but as<br>you'll see later it's only important<br>because it's involved in the regulation<br>of oxytocin secretion an ox Orson is for<br>those of you who are more classically<br>trained awk source not only helps you<br>give birth and keep your baby alive but<br>actually it's responsible for the<br>creation of the Milky week we were all<br>that so this is Heracles struggling at<br>head as nipples and Tintoretto if he<br>wasn't such great artists could have<br>been a physiologist because here is<br>actually captured the physiology<br>perfectly the baby is suckling at one<br>metal you might notice is actually two<br>nipples there and the spray of milk<br>that's making the spray of stars that is<br>the Milky Way is coming from both<br>nipples naps because the baby suckling<br>at this nipple is sending electrical<br>impulses to the brain of Hira who is<br>then secreting ox awesome and policies<br>that travels around the body is a<br>hormone in the blood system and arrives<br>at both nipples so the milk gets ejected<br>from both nipples in response to<br>suckling at one tintoretto isn't the<br>only person only artists to treat the<br>subject ribbons are ago out at several<br>decades later and at first glance you<br>might think Oh ribbons not such a good<br>physiologist there's tinto at all<br>because the milk to only promote one<br>site but actually ribbons has caught it<br>perfectly as well because here unless<br>instance Heracles isn't actually<br>suckling at the Nepal quite painfully<br>looking it's just a manual squeeze of<br>the breast that's causing the milk<br>ejection<br>and that's not the appropriate stimulus<br>for ox tools and secretion from the<br>brain cycling the nipple is so here the<br>milk is only commit one side because the<br>the stimulus is not a listing the<br>appropriate response to get the milk<br>ejection from both breasts so that's my<br>pretense of being well educated and<br>welcome back to physiology for the rest<br>of the lecture so this is no essentially<br>human body systems one main one so for<br>both this full system is called the<br>Ferguson reflex and the start and<br>process is when the babies had pushes<br>down on the cervix and that causes<br>stretch of the cervix and that stretch<br>is sensed by special receptors in the<br>cervix which sends nervous impulses up<br>to a specialized that the brain called<br>the hypothalamus which controls the<br>secretion of most of the hormones in the<br>body including the secretion of oxytocin<br>so the oxytocin cells reside within the<br>hypothalamus and when you get that<br>stretch the cervix you get an increase<br>in this action potential frequency and<br>as I told you this is not just a general<br>increase if it's an episodic busting<br>response to that stretch these oxfords<br>neurons send the projections to the<br>posterior pituitary gland who are these<br>secrete the oxygen to the blood so that<br>increases oxytocin levels which in this<br>instance causes contraction of other<br>muscle cells and uterus to cause the<br>delivery of the baby so this again as I<br>said textbook physiology even when I was<br>still relatively young but what were I<br>became interested in is what actually<br>what mechanisms drive this pattern how<br>do these neurons take this continuously<br>delivered information and transform it<br>into patterned output because perhaps<br>this is the way that being sales<br>function<br>not in the in the simple integration of<br>all these inputs coming in and here I go<br>passively but here I have properties and<br>I can process signals and make a<br>decision about how those signals are<br>relayed of course much smarter guys and<br>I had been dealing with this for decades<br>and it's quite daunting to come at these<br>things so I was left with this kind of<br>thing if you can't be as smart as<br>everybody else what can you do well you<br>can walk prick hard at it so eventually<br>the movie industry caught up with my<br>thinking and came up with a court that I<br>would be looking for my whole life so<br>the question I'd came home home actually<br>signs the show that's how am I going to<br>do something that actually makes<br>reference to our understanding so got<br>the baby is coming and get that thing<br>out of me so people have been working on<br>it and working on this particular<br>activity pattern really getting pretty<br>much lawyer so so for reasons I won't go<br>into I took a totally different tack<br>from the field and that was to look at<br>the effects of the painkiller morphine<br>the Knox sauce themselves and I can see<br>gin chem almost getting interested my<br>gin gins the latest student to be<br>subjected to this theme of research so<br>this this diagram shows the firing rate<br>of another oxygen self from actually<br>from a brain slice prepared from Iraq by<br>a colleague of mine John wickedly<br>towards this particular example because<br>it was published in the year that i<br>started my undergraduate studies and<br>what what he shows here is this oxytocin<br>cell is switched off if you give if you<br>if you apply morphine the pain color and<br>if you give a drug which blocks the<br>actions of morphine you can get the<br>recovery of the activity of the socks to<br>us and cell with a remarkable thing<br>about these sir<br>is that you don't actually have to give<br>this locks on to block the effects the<br>morphine and get recovery if you give<br>the morphine to these brain cells for<br>long enough they'll start firing again<br>they will start will change their<br>physiological state to essentially<br>pathophysiological state and they'll<br>require the morphine to be there to<br>function apparently normally and when<br>you take the morphine away at that point<br>if you allow them to recover first and<br>then give the drug that blocks and<br>morphine effects you get a syndrome<br>called the withdrawal syndrome which is<br>analogous to call turkey addiction so<br>this process is called morphine<br>dependence and it's one of the the<br>physical processes that underpin the<br>psychological process of addiction but<br>importantly what we also knew from was<br>it done is that there are drugs or<br>chemicals inside your brain that the<br>same is morphine that's my morphine wats<br>because it's making the effect of<br>something that's already there and what<br>we know is that what we knew is that<br>that those endogenous substances those<br>chemicals released within the brain<br>actually inhibit oxytocin sales over the<br>course of pregnancy so when I come into<br>this I commend with the idea that<br>perhaps that what happens is the Ox<br>awesome cells are kept quiet over<br>pregnancy by these endogenous these<br>natural morphine like substances and<br>then when you're going to give birth<br>that inhibition is removed and you get<br>it the the excitation so some make see<br>that more things more fun than getting<br>pregnant I have to admit I've never<br>tried that particular drug so I can't<br>express an opinion but I can summarize<br>some what about five or six years work<br>and one slide this one slide that sadly<br>has never been published so here this is<br>a recording of an oxytocin sale from a<br>nice tie rack that has been given<br>morphine for five days and then it's<br>given the drug that blocks the effects<br>of that morphine and what you can see is<br>there's an excitation and importantly on<br>top of that generalized the excitation<br>you can see not identical to what you<br>see in in suckling but busts of activity<br>every few minutes and of course I saw<br>this and I thought well done we've<br>sorted it what do I but scientists and<br>the audience will be seeing wheels the<br>replication and simple factors reason<br>this is the first to the best of my<br>recollection this is the first time I've<br>ever showing this data to anyone outside<br>the lab we never replicated this so<br>we've done this experiment for different<br>reasons in different ways that we've<br>done it possibly even hundreds of times<br>and this is the only sale that ever<br>responded the way that we wanted and you<br>don't get a Nobel Prize for N equals one<br>so what do you do you've had your idea<br>still think it was a reasonable idea but<br>it wasn't right so at this point my<br>career high so that recording should<br>have said was I think some wood about<br>1996 we've got to so fast or we should<br>be finished by by 30 I moved on to<br>another sale tape actually so looking at<br>visa Crescent sales in the brain and the<br>reason i was looking to chose to do that<br>is because the visa person cells and the<br>oxytocin cells are almost identical the<br>different from each other but you know<br>almost twins visual person cells with<br>nothing to do reproduction at least<br>level I've been talking to you about<br>what their what the deal with is body<br>fluid balance so when you're thirsty<br>you're thirsty because you're running<br>out of water last thing you want to do<br>if you're running out water is going pee<br>what you've got left up against the wall<br>so what these repress themselves do is<br>actually act on your kidney to reabsorb<br>the water in your urine so that you<br>don't lose any more water prolonging hey<br>long and still life but not keeping you<br>alive unless you actually go and get<br>more water the reason we've gone to the<br>visual person sells was because the<br>visual Crescent cells also show a<br>bustling activity pattern it's not the<br>same as the Ox awesome cells but it has<br>similarities so here this is the the<br>firing rate of vasopressin cell recorded<br>from an innocent eyes rack so again<br>providing rate and spikes for second on<br>the y-axis time in minutes in the x-axis<br>and you can see these costs are much<br>longer and a bit not quite so high<br>amplitude two advantages to looking at<br>me as a person sales is one the boss the<br>longer so you got more time to actually<br>do something to investigate what's going<br>on during rules<br>the second reason is that you need to<br>control your water balance all of the<br>time so you don't have to work on<br>pregnant or lactating rights and go<br>through all of that and look for a<br>specific phenomenon only cause it one<br>specific time of life and actually even<br>during that only goes for two seconds<br>every five minutes when it works so a<br>large proportion visa person says sure<br>this behavior throughout life so I and<br>others in the field spent a quite long<br>time this is a 10-year oven yet for me<br>trying to work out how this part in a<br>set up with the idea that we might be<br>able to use that to inform our<br>understanding of what might be going on<br>oxytocin sales and apply experiments to<br>investigate that system so this sums up<br>where we got to so this again is a<br>single act potential so this is a<br>voltage tricks single action potential<br>is thing from a basal present cell and<br>the inset is what want to draw your<br>attention to so this is the action<br>potential here and what you can see is<br>after the Act potential is a there's a<br>very very small but long lasting<br>excursion in the voltage and by<br>long-lasting it if you look at a time<br>scale lyssa this is several seconds long<br>and then brain communications several<br>seconds is an eternity communication<br>most people in neuroscience to think<br>about it think about millisecond<br>communication so this changes the<br>excitability of the vasopressin cell so<br>what I didn't see T earlier is these<br>action potentials these electrical<br>impulses are all or none events so if<br>you make the voltage go far enough up<br>you will reach what we call threshold<br>and then you get your action potential<br>in this instance the voltage didn't<br>reach that threshold and sort just<br>slowly decayed back down to baseline and<br>bumbled along<br>doing nothing very exciting so that<br>voltage excursion is called an after the<br>polarization to depolarizing a dble<br>depolarization of the membrane voltage<br>and it happens after an action potential<br>it's caused by the action potential<br>itself but sometimes you'll get one of<br>these action potentials with your after<br>depolarization marked by the little<br>asterisk and something else will come in<br>and make the sale reach threshold and<br>you get another action potential and<br>because that after the polarization is<br>so long-lasting the second acts<br>potential super imposed on that first<br>depolarization so they add up and<br>eventually you each point where you<br>reach a new steady state where the cell<br>is more excitable because it's closer to<br>the point where you can trigger that all<br>or none acts potential and send a signal<br>to if you're a your run-of-the-mill<br>brain cell that I'm not very interested<br>in another brain cell in the brain or to<br>the prostitute recline and secrete the<br>oxytocin and in this case the visa press<br>then to the bloodstream so I spent about<br>ten years what can I how this works the<br>actual contribution i made isn't on the<br>slide but what we did do through what by<br>a colleague and friend of mine harvey us<br>down while he was working in balance<br>roms lab they identified that this this<br>phenomenon is not normally seen in<br>oxytocin neurons if you record them from<br>a virgin rat but if you record them from<br>a lactating rat or a late pregnant rat<br>you do see this phenomenon so if this<br>phenomenon emojis in late pregnancy and<br>remains during lactation you would guess<br>that it's probably doing something to do<br>so we turn back to our ox or some<br>neurons with a question does enhancement<br>of that after the polarization that was<br>identified does that increase the<br>activity in such a way that it could<br>underpin the behavior that we see in<br>both and lactation so we went back to<br>the in vivo situation so this again is<br>another recording from a nice thighs rat<br>and the dependent here means that this<br>is a from a rat that was treated with<br>morphine for five days again because we<br>decided we wanted to give ourselves the<br>best chance possible if it worked one of<br>several hundred times oh and in the<br>other experiences that maybe more often<br>if we do the experiment in these ones so<br>we gave a drug called Ackerman it's<br>actually the the active ingredient and<br>Eve enim so this is what makes it sting<br>and saw absolutely nothing so we gave a<br>high outdoor sighs you do that first it<br>doesn't work Pettit with a bigger hammer<br>and unfortunately that didn't do<br>anything so let's hit it you know let's<br>put our hammers down and cool a<br>sledgehammer so we hit it with the<br>naloxone the drug that blocks the<br>effects the ongoing affects the morphine<br>puts you in all causes aa robust the<br>excitation and when we do that we see<br>nothing or nothing different what we see<br>even that that appaman isn't present so<br>playing around with the the if you like<br>the endogenous morphine the natural<br>morphine and playing around with the<br>intrinsic properties the after<br>depolarization of these cells even when<br>you put them together we can't replicate<br>that busting behavior and that signs the<br>way I see it we didn't manage to do it<br>and actually with with my usual level of<br>intelligence after 15 years of trying<br>realize that I was probably wasting my<br>time because both and lactation<br>lactation for mammals are absolutely<br>essential not only for your survival of<br>your family survival it's absolutely<br>essential for survival the species so<br>why or why if you believe in intelligent<br>design would you design a system that<br>will fall over if you poke it in one way<br>so actually in reflection it's no<br>surprise to me that you can't replicate<br>this behavior by changing one or two<br>things because the the system itself I<br>would expect is going to be multiplied<br>redundant you would not go out your way<br>to design a system that will fall and<br>feel and be the end of your species and<br>if you believe in evolution I think<br>something that evolved randomly that we<br>also would mean that we weren't here in<br>this room tonight so that point actually<br>coincides with just the right time that<br>I came to toggle we've know some of the<br>experiments have done after a right and<br>what we've done in the lab here which<br>I'm going to deal with in the last few<br>signed slides is actually stop trying to<br>work out what causes that busting yeah<br>I've backed off ramat of part in the too<br>hard basket and you know maybe another<br>decade own lane i may come back to it as<br>the swan song of my career but what<br>we're in what we've become interested in<br>is not what causes that what actually<br>causes the boston what triggers each<br>individual bust but what changes the<br>excitability of the ox awesome cells at<br>the end of pregnancy and during<br>lactation that will make it easier for<br>whatever it is that is processing that<br>signal to be successful to actually<br>drive the increase in activity that we<br>see at this time so said earlier<br>collaborate with Dave granton and Dave<br>on enough sweetie this is 2009 we<br>started this to look at black<br>effects so the two hormones that control<br>lactation are oxytocin which causes the<br>milk ejection when the the baby suckles<br>and prolactin named for its effects and<br>lactation crew lactational causes milk<br>synthesis but it was known that actually<br>if you give prolactin into the brain of<br>rats and we've done this here again in<br>anesthetized rats and voting rights<br>prolactin will inhibit ox tools<br>themselves and that's fine because in<br>voting rights are actually doing<br>something else colac t'en is it over 400<br>certainly over 300 300 different actions<br>the one its name for is one we're<br>interested in oxytocin also has lots<br>more functions but we're not going to<br>mention the two words of love form one<br>tonight so here we have collected<br>inhibiting outsourcing neurons but what<br>we find is if you do exactly the same<br>recordings using exactly same conditions<br>but in an animal that's lactating what<br>you find is if you have collect men to<br>the being of that a nice thighs<br>lactating animal some box tools<br>themselves will still be inhibited very<br>similar to what you see in the votans<br>but not many most of them are actually<br>not affected at all and some are<br>actually excited so there's a looks like<br>there's at least a loss of the<br>inhibition and perhaps even a switch to<br>an excitation so involving animals you<br>don't want oxytocin and prolactin to be<br>secreted same thing but lacked eating<br>animals and perhaps at the end of both<br>and we haven't tackled that problem yet<br>you want polite and knocks torsten to<br>act in concert you want them to<br>reinforce each other because you want to<br>synthesize milk at the same time is<br>you're delivering milk to the young you<br>need to replenish your stores of milk so<br>having a system actually does that it<br>seems quite intuitive were obvious and<br>this is what sorry should have said<br>ritual that has been led by Rachel<br>dusting the lab<br>over the last few years eve were helped<br>by Greg boa the other thing we're<br>looking at in the lab that might be<br>important and this is actually probably<br>the most exciting thing but I'm so<br>Scotty she wouldn't catch the excitement<br>my voice when I tell you is this other<br>noodle peptide the class Colchis patent<br>so what we've discovered through work of<br>Xander Seymour who just finished his PhD<br>in lab working this topic is that a<br>specific group of chris patten sells<br>appears to act on oxytocin cells in the<br>brain at the end of pregnancy so here<br>this is an image of bit of a slice<br>through the brain of Iraq where you find<br>ox tools themselves to the green blobs<br>are essentially oxytocin cells in the<br>brain and you have to take my word for<br>it moment that the red is kept and<br>staining there is some there and as you<br>go through pregnancy and the rats<br>there's more and more and more so in our<br>rat colonies day 20 10 pregnancy is the<br>expected day of parturition the expected<br>day of delivery of the young and what<br>Xander has identified is that these<br>cells that synthesize expectin a<br>specific subpopulation of them increase<br>the amount of respect and listen sighs<br>towards the end of pregnancy so if they<br>do that at that time again intuition<br>would suggest that possible they're<br>doing something to do with pregnancy so<br>I vicky scott who was a post often lab<br>for a number of years before she turned<br>to the dark side and enrolled in<br>medicine<br>did the equivalent did the<br>electrophysiology on on this circus back<br>and so when khatik when you work on an<br>anesthetized virgin right when you<br>inject to spectin into the brain of that<br>rotten rat has absolutely no effect in<br>early pregnancy some cells respond not<br>many for some do mid pregnancy again<br>some cells respond more stone but at the<br>end of pregnancy in the last couple of<br>days of pregnancy all oxytocin cells are<br>excited by respect and injected into the<br>brain of recent Iraq so the scientists<br>in the audience will recognize that I've<br>shown you absolutely no data what server<br>tonight shown you a bunch of examples<br>and Ashley to trust me so on the final<br>science slide of actual pits and results<br>in so that so the line that been feeding<br>you is actually correct so this just<br>quantifies the elect physiology results<br>are shown in the previous light so that<br>NP is non-pregnant change and firing<br>rate so zero means it didn't change<br>after injection of his pet commercial in<br>the previous slides so in the non<br>pregnant animals there's a scatter<br>around zero early and mid pregnant<br>animals some sales clearly respond and<br>that's what these gray dots are the gray<br>dots are the individual measures from<br>individual cells and the black cars are<br>but in the elite pregnant animals all of<br>a sales respond to this pattern so what<br>we think is going on and it is still<br>just think this is a working hypothesis<br>we don't know if this is true and if<br>there's any funding agencies and the<br>audience would be very hard to receive<br>more money to try and work it out as we<br>have these kisspeptin cells in the brain<br>we have rocks torsten cells in the brain<br>and some other gains of cells so over<br>the course of pregnancy these days<br>Petrin sales increase the census of this<br>pattern and we think actually they<br>probably don't have a direct effect on<br>the oxytocin cells themselves who think<br>it's probably mediated by some other<br>neuron brain cell in the brain but we<br>know about this population of conception<br>sales and the oxygen cells themselves as<br>they actually express the proteins that<br>allow them to respond to product and/or<br>more specific than this case placental<br>action which works and exactly the same<br>to exactly the same systems as the<br>palatinate talked about earlier so we're<br>currently investigating and the and the<br>hrc program grant that valen mentioned<br>in the introduction is trying to work<br>out whether this prolactin drives the<br>changes in these two spectrum your<br>honors that allow that increase the<br>excitability of the ox or some neurons<br>at the end of pregnancy may be also<br>acting directly the prolactin acting<br>directly on the oxygen cells to increase<br>directly increase the responsiveness to<br>these excitatory inputs and the key<br>thing about this the thing that's<br>actually most exciting about this is so<br>far as we're aware this is the only<br>thing that because patent is doing in<br>the brain at the end of pregnancy so if<br>we can target that particular system<br>then we have a potential to reduce the<br>excitability or<br>the brain cells secrete the hormone that<br>caused birth so for people for<br>individuals at risk of preterm labor we<br>might be able to develop drugs a<br>different class of drugs that will<br>reduce the risk of preterm labor without<br>affecting the the I said I wouldn't say<br>it but I'm going to the love hormone<br>side of the oxytocin equation which is<br>not the oxytocin secreted into the blood<br>pop store some other cells secrete<br>oxytocin into the brain and acts all the<br>oxytocin that's involved in social<br>bonding and if you give drugs interfere<br>with oxytocin signalling you'll<br>interfere with the social bonding and<br>actually the maternal bond so if we can<br>isolate this population of oxygen cells<br>which are the only ones that affected by<br>this kiss pet and input then we have a<br>new target for drugs to protect against<br>I meant to delete this but so we think<br>this population of neurons is probably<br>expressing another transmitting they've<br>been called noradrenaline so what you'll<br>recognize this I didn't actually get to<br>the endpoint of where I started and I<br>think that's the way that sign swaps you<br>start with a ball and mind and after two<br>and a half decades for in my instance of<br>working through all this still trying to<br>science the out of it don't signs<br>to show anything on your own in this<br>game increasingly science is becoming a<br>collaborative effort and it's like to<br>acknowledge the people in the lab Rachel<br>Greg Alexander or the people whose what<br>actually showed you we also have Aaron<br>and Ranjan who are doing work on<br>visitation sales actually how that<br>impacts cardiovascular function and<br>those all of those projects on<br>collaboration with people toggle lucky<br>enough to have good strong<br>collaborations with international legal<br>leaders around the world and again is<br>brown and said none of it be possible<br>without the funding agencies who kept us<br>going kept me going for 25 years even<br>though I think it's not sufficient<br>because we the physiology apartment is I<br>think at this time over 100 people right<br>all cooling in the same direction trying<br>to achieve the same rules and I get time<br>to do all of the fun stuff all the<br>teaching and the research because the<br>physiology partner think functions<br>really well as a team just like to take<br>this opportunity to particularly thank<br>the general staff in the department<br>because all the that you guys do<br>for all of the administration that<br>idiots like me don't have to do make it<br>much easier for us to succeed then our<br>research as well as not teaching but you<br>don't get the biggest thanks<br>I still haven't managed to see ya I<br>heard you I didn't see you so it was<br>sadly I have to say there's only only<br>one prime minister of science prize<br>winning a member of the brings and it's<br>not the big fat ass hole when there in<br>the orange jersey so I've got a lot of<br>catching up to do the rest the family as<br>to the kids so if you didn't didn't<br>understand it's actually it's able an<br>Armstrong who works in the chemistry<br>department who has won it and has been<br>my partner for 25 News and I'm looking<br>forward to the next 25 if I can last<br>that long and the final thing I have is<br>just a message to any of the younger<br>members of the audience I those of you<br>nor me reasonably well for a long time<br>at know that I am an ex movie star well<br>movie star may be a bit of an<br>exaggeration I appear in the movie<br>trainspotting by one and a half seconds<br>has been used by standard number two and<br>that's just by way of introduction<br>because that story was around and I when<br>trying to Tiffany flaming he was a<br>visiting student we came to my lab from<br>Harvey R stands lab and when she went<br>back she found this in Santa to me and<br>it's still my favorite image about<br>research I'm not going to read it all<br>because you can read it quicker than I<br>can see it but being in the game long<br>enough i have actually suffered every<br>single thing on this list apartment<br>houses and i'm working on that now but<br>despite that i mean i can't think of<br>anything better anything better to do<br>with your life then to create and<br>disseminate new knowledge and despite<br>all of the crap that goes on and all the<br>completing the eye and all those do i<br>would still choose research so with that<br>thanks Colin i'm brian hyland and it's<br>my honor to be the current head of<br>department of physiology and i have a<br>couple of rolls to do now at the end of<br>this presentation first is to formally<br>thank Colin for the presentation and I<br>was told that I have up to 10 minutes<br>I'm pleased you sat down I think you<br>know what what colin has has achieved<br>here tinnitus is to give us a very nice<br>example of how an entry and the team<br>colleagues collaborators working away<br>and picking a piece of the puzzle the<br>brain is this huge puzzle and it's made<br>up of many many individual pieces and<br>there's enough work in there for many of<br>us to work for our entire careers<br>working on each small piece but by<br>addressing this wonderful I think Colin<br>you know really showed it up in the way<br>it is is this dance a symphony of<br>electricity and chemistry underlying one<br>particular pathway which in the end<br>focuses on a single hormone single<br>chemical and yet is involved in as we as<br>was discussed in the talk over 300<br>separate functions each person is<br>working away unpicking that piece of the<br>puzzle and as part of a bigger<br>enterprise across the university here<br>cross around the world that's needed to<br>address of course what is as Colin<br>pointed out the single most complicated<br>thing in the universe and I think you<br>know it's a really nice example of that<br>into play as I said electricity<br>chemistry dogged perseverance and hard<br>work which is coming together to produce<br>a better understanding of the basic<br>physiology the basic processes and<br>through that the opportunity in one<br>never knows where this is going to arise<br>from from basic research to identify<br>targets identify causes of problems in<br>the brain and identify ways to address<br>those problem<br>and treat conditions which affect our<br>health and well-being so once again I'd<br>like you all to join me and they<br>congratulate and colon on ascension to<br>professorship and for his presentation<br>tonight<br>now the next thing I get to do is to<br>give out the goodies so if I can do this<br>one-handed calling you will have to<br>stand up again so what we have<br>traditionally in these processes is we<br>we give the prisoner I mean the<br>presenter a couple of recognitions of<br>the of the event because it is a very<br>important event in ER academics life so<br>Colin here's a big thing to do for you<br>to remember the event by and I have a<br>smaller thing which is not what you<br>think it might be you know the envelope<br>got bought out by the head of department<br>but no this is a small thing but<br>actually quite an interesting thing I<br>think you'll find so once again Colin<br>thank you and hope you enjoy the<br>products of that envelope ok so the very<br>final thing I have to do then is to<br>point out that that Colin didn't have<br>time to get very much into some of the<br>other functions of oxytocin in the brain<br>and he he did sort of intimated a little<br>bit to what we could perhaps delicately<br>call the pro social aspects of oxytocin<br>oxytocin function in the brain that is<br>it's very important for promoting social<br>bonding and interaction but it is also<br>important for its activated by feeding<br>and drinking as it turns out and luckily<br>we have an opportunity to test that<br>hypothesis because it's my pleasure now<br>to invite you all to come and join us<br>for the final element of the celebration<br>which are refreshments in the staff club<br>upstairs in the staff club you find your<br>way if you don't know through the the<br>works around here do you leave the<br>lecture theatre on that side come and<br>join us to celebrate with Colin with<br>those refreshments and finally it's just<br>my great pleasure to thank you all the<br>audience for coming along to this to<br>this event<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
