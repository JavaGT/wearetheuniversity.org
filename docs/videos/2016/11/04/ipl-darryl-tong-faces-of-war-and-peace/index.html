katoa my name is<br>Harlene Hayne and i'm the vice<br>chancellor here at the university of<br>otago and it is my great pleasure to<br>welcome you to Darrell tongs inaugural<br>professorial lecture I'd like to welcome<br>the staff and students from the<br>University of Otago I'd also like to<br>welcome members of the University<br>Council and members of the general<br>Dunedin community but I'd also like to<br>extend a particularly warm welcome to<br>Darryl's family who are here with us<br>this evening his wife Katherine is here<br>as well as three of their four children<br>Katie Victoria and William unfortunately<br>Philip is unable to join us this evening<br>because he is busy pursuing his studies<br>in architecture at Victoria well we have<br>all gathered together here this evening<br>to celebrate Darrell's promotion to<br>Professor now I first met Daryl when I<br>was the deputy vice-chancellor here at<br>the University of Otago and he and his<br>colleague Neil wadell presented their<br>invention to the board of Otago<br>innovation limited now at a time when<br>not everyone in the university could see<br>the value in the commercialization of<br>research Darryl and Neil's life-saving<br>device became the poster child that I<br>used to help people understand not only<br>how universities could commercialize<br>their findings but why they must now<br>like all professors here at the<br>University of Otago daryl is a gifted<br>teacher and a world-class researcher but<br>tonight in my opening remarks I want to<br>focus briefly on his service in addition<br>to his academic roles daryl is also a<br>max vac surgeon here in Dunedin he is<br>the man who gets hauled out of bed in<br>the middle of the night to save not only<br>a face but often a life he has also the<br>unique honor of being the honorary<br>surgeon to his Excellency the governor<br>general of new zealand holding the rank<br>of colonel<br>daryl is the only max facts consultant<br>for the New Zealand Defence Force he was<br>deployed to afghanistan in 2009 where he<br>was the first new zealand uniform<br>surgeon to be deployed to a combat zone<br>since the Vietnam War within our<br>university community Darryl uses his<br>medical talents to provide vital support<br>during our hyde street party each year<br>and throughout the rest of the year he<br>also has come to the rescue of some of<br>our students in their gravest hour of<br>need so in short Darryl Tong is one busy<br>man he's a teacher a researcher and<br>inventor a surgeon and an officer and on<br>top of all this he is one of the nicest<br>and the most humble people I have ever<br>known I am very much looking forward to<br>his lecture this evening so Darryl on<br>behalf of the university of otago i<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your well-deserved promotion to<br>professor and i will now call on<br>professor Paul Brunton the Dean of the<br>dental school to tell us a little bit<br>more about your academic and<br>professional history tena koe toten<br>kiora tena koutou katoa Darryl isn't as<br>we've heard an oral and maxillofacial<br>surgeon who qualified in dentistry and<br>medicine from the university of otago<br>and completed his specialist training in<br>seattle in the state's gaining a<br>master's degree from the University of<br>Washington Daryl completed his PhD in<br>war surgery of the face and jaws in 2013<br>and we've already heard was promoted to<br>professor in 2016 here at the university<br>of otago he Hills fellowships from the<br>Royal Colleges of surgeons in ireland<br>and england and the American College of<br>Surgeons and is an active clinician<br>teacher and researcher his varied<br>research interests include military and<br>ballistic trauma military and surgical<br>history and quantifying the impact force<br>is associated with concussion sub<br>concussion involving the development of<br>a forensic head model in addition to all<br>the things you've heard that dowel does<br>he finds time to be both a husband and a<br>father to four children as we know and<br>in addition to all that he's a very<br>valued colleague here at the dental<br>school I now invite Darryl to addresses<br>with his lecture and titled faces of war<br>so tonight is very much a night of<br>saying thank you to all these people<br>these wonderful people that's come to my<br>life to help me get to where I am today<br>and it's you know it's been a journey in<br>those who have known me for a long time<br>I'm sorry are those who have known me<br>for a long time it's a rather torturous<br>journey as well my family's been in New<br>Zealand for four generations my<br>great-grandfather came just after the<br>gold rush and worked as a common laborer<br>and set up one the first Chinese<br>laundries in Central Otago I actually<br>Gore actually of all places so they've<br>been the same since my grandparents<br>generation worked in the market gardens<br>my parents generation worked in the food<br>industry and that's where i grew up your<br>eyes the skinny asian kid behind the<br>counter taking your dinner orders right<br>and saying hey do you want rice with<br>that anyway so the first of my thank<br>yous is to thank my ancestral family for<br>putting up with discrimination<br>deprivation and just sheer hard work to<br>give us what we have today I thank my<br>parents for giving me a work ethic which<br>I hold very dear and I'm trying to<br>impart upon others our surgeons and<br>registrar's included when I was very<br>young I was brought up on my<br>grandparents so I dearly miss my<br>grandparents I mean what's not to like I<br>mean how can you not like someone who<br>smokes a pipe a all granddad's should<br>smoke a pipe and grandma and granddad<br>made sure that my brother and myself<br>understood the value of getting a good<br>education because they understood the<br>only way to escape the sheer misery of<br>Whitley of what they went through is to<br>get a good education and so I managed to<br>bumble my way through school and high<br>school and college<br>and eventually landed in the mighty o<br>Tiger University and it's a school of<br>dentistry in circa late 1980s and I know<br>there's look there's pizza hut yeah why<br>I say that is because Pete goes during<br>our time here um late 80s that's when<br>Pizza Hut first open was magnificent<br>foreign food wonderful anyway so another<br>one of my thinking that one thing I<br>can't find at all is a is a faculty<br>photo from the 1980s it doesn't really<br>matter cause I think most of you are<br>still here so so you're to blame for<br>what I am today so I'm sorry but thank<br>you faculty for for teaching me and<br>putting up with me and also thank you to<br>the nursing staff some of which are here<br>today as well and the general clerical<br>staff who are often forgotten in when<br>you start thinking to people but good<br>solid education I also like to thank the<br>New Zealand hospital system for not<br>giving me a job as a house surgeon and<br>forcing me to go to outback Australia<br>where I learnt self-reliance and just as<br>important self-belief and that's<br>something that for you younger people<br>coming through you've got to back<br>yourselves because what we do at the<br>University we give you the tools to do<br>this but you've got to take them and<br>build stuff with them now in my time and<br>out back i received a telegram there's<br>no email back in those that's a telegram<br>good old-fashioned piece of paper say do<br>you want your rotary foundation<br>scholarship for a trip overseas for a<br>year to study as why do I want yeah so<br>after a bit of homework and discussing<br>on people I managed to land a spot at<br>the mighty University of Washington in<br>Seattle listen this is this is the<br>health sci campus look at it it's the<br>size of on my room I mean<br>masson mean you drive from one place<br>there's even got its own waterfront but<br>why don't we have that here you know and<br>um wow talk about learning heaps and<br>terrible hours so you're rohana Iran and<br>Harsha is not here time we trained and<br>the how students don't believe it but we<br>trained before the 70 out cap so the<br>hours are horrible so they don't believe<br>the stuff we went through but anyway and<br>half / half of that time in the seven<br>years that I spent in Seattle was that<br>Harborview Medical Center which is a<br>level one trauma center and the only<br>state funded hospital in Seattle at the<br>time and we saw lots of stuff and talk<br>about busy in terms of just general<br>trauma and ballistic trauma the military<br>surgeons would rotate through our<br>hospital to get experience that's helped<br>us here was I think three men in<br>particular and I think all my teachers<br>but these three men put me on my career<br>path early on professor philip<br>Worthington Bob mile and Rosberg I<br>thankful at Worthington and teaching me<br>the value of talking and communicating<br>with patients and really connecting with<br>them I also thank him as a role model<br>for showing me the dignity of our<br>profession in seven years that I knew<br>him he had never raised his voice and<br>yet anyone and everyone would do things<br>for Bob mile taught me the value of<br>diagnosis and always questioning why why<br>is it happening are you truly happy with<br>what you've come up with is there more<br>that we've missed is he more that we can<br>do in rossburn who was out here a few<br>years ago as a visiting professor<br>nurtured me in terms of research and<br>teaching all three of them backed my<br>application when I came back to a tiger<br>in 1999 and there you go in a bit of a<br>culture shock I mean Catherine and I<br>came back from you know from a<br>city of clothes on 5 million and and<br>24-hour convenience to a city of less<br>than a hundred thousand and in shops<br>that were closed on Sunday so the<br>culture shop of course we love it here<br>now just wouldn't think of a better<br>place what a privilege it is to be an<br>academic staff member at Tiger<br>University and one thing that has been<br>very very clear in crystallized in the<br>last few years is the importance of the<br>three arms of academic practice it's<br>teaching service and research and as you<br>can see from a three-legged stool if one<br>is deficient or even missing things are<br>very unstable it might even fall over so<br>that's one thing that we need to embrace<br>as the fact that we have three arms or<br>misses three legs but it all works<br>together to prop up your academic<br>practice in terms of teaching I have a<br>teach a heavy teaching load as many of<br>my colleagues have not all of my<br>colleagues who work at the dental school<br>as well so I teach many year groups and<br>courses in dentistry but also teach<br>medical students and and postgraduates<br>nursing staff but also teaching roles<br>outside of the university particularly<br>st. John's medics New Zealand Dental<br>Association and the defense source and<br>the Royal Australasian College of Dental<br>Surgeons so that's a big part of the<br>academic practice in terms of service<br>proudly 100% owned by the university but<br>I do most of my major trauma work and on<br>call it through the hospital and I'm<br>very very honored to see some of my<br>colleagues from though from the hospital<br>here tonight but also out in the<br>community as well as you know I'm very<br>involved with the military also looking<br>out the veterans at Monticello War<br>veterans rest home and hospital<br>but also again with st. John's and some<br>mentorship and pastoral care at st.<br>Margaret's college for residents in<br>terms of research I'd say it's an<br>evolving feast and these are only just<br>snippets of what I'm currently involved<br>with and as you can see lots of names<br>and it is a great privilege to be<br>surrounded and supported by like-minded<br>people some very talented people and I'm<br>i apologize now if your name's not up<br>there I'm sorry it's not because I don't<br>like you it's just that I just can't fit<br>everything on now and in terms of<br>tonight though I want to focus on a<br>couple of areas of research one is the<br>forensic head model in sub-concussive<br>injury the other is war surgery military<br>history because these two research areas<br>are wonderful in terms of how things<br>actually come together in terms of<br>research teaching and service now you're<br>thinking how does this actually work<br>well if you change those words around<br>when talk about researcher to our<br>evidence-based medicine if you talk<br>about teaching is the transfer of<br>knowledge and the transfer of how to be<br>a professional in terms of service its<br>clinical and professional experience you<br>can't teach without experience you can't<br>teach without knowing what your students<br>need to know yourself you can't research<br>without having a question so these<br>things fit together and at this stage i<br>want to say very very big thank you to<br>the wonderful surgical form foot firm of<br>the silver to silver to tom<br>I have never worked in a place where the<br>surgical colleagues treat each other<br>like brothers so thank you Ron I mean we<br>really look after each other wait it's<br>the only place i know of that we<br>actually fight to take call off each<br>other what do you two know that's zero<br>it's a dumb thing to do but anyway we do<br>that and we support each other and it's<br>a wonderful thing so thank you and I'm<br>sure harsh is not even paying attention<br>some weeks anyway azizam free lanka<br>few years ago our late professor Jules<br>Kizer myself and a few others looked at<br>some facial trauma statistics over a<br>20-year period what we found it was was<br>not really surprising but it was<br>interesting at the time to actually put<br>it on paper that there was a fair amount<br>of trauma being seen predominantly male<br>and the age groups involved named the<br>young people the main causes that we<br>found for males was interpersonal<br>violence or befo sports related injuries<br>and motor vehicle accidents now this is<br>different from places like the Middle<br>East the reason being as you soon find<br>out it's probably alcohol and the<br>pattern of interpersonal violence<br>followed by sports followed by MVAs is<br>similar in Australia and similar in<br>Glasgow of all places I'm not surprising<br>at all and also South Africa as well but<br>not the states and certainly not in the<br>Middle East and so certainly not parts<br>of Malaysia main causes of females<br>unintentional Falls followed by<br>interpersonal violence followed by motor<br>vehicle access now you're scratching it<br>so who would intentionally fall no one<br>would say I'm going to wake up today I'm<br>going to fall over unfortunately there<br>is a sinister side to this unintentional<br>all fall as code word for domestic<br>violence how did you get your black eye<br>I fell over or how many times did you<br>fall over to get the facial injuries<br>that you got and it's sad that New<br>Zealand such a wonderful clean green<br>country has some of the worst records of<br>interpersonal violence domestic violence<br>in the world with and it's up to us as<br>health professionals there's a community<br>to stop that you know no I'm not going<br>to go down that road cars on I'll<br>probably get in trouble so i won't i'll<br>tell you afterwards anyway so a few<br>years later there's I let's let's let's<br>see what's happening have we improve all<br>these messages of don't hit people wear<br>mouth guards that type of thing guess<br>what nothing's really changed but what<br>has changed is the consumption of<br>alcohol the lowering of the legal<br>drinking age the cheer availability and<br>supermarkets I mean it shocks me that I<br>can go into a well-known supermarket<br>chain you walkin through them berries<br>and the first thing you see apart from<br>your fruit and veg alcohol it's just<br>there in your face and big bold<br>marketing things on sale now brain cell<br>death you know in a bottle you know and<br>it's binge triggers in those ads it's<br>not it's not it's not what we dress how<br>we drink and going on about the hyde<br>street keg party a couple of years ago<br>yeah ninety-nine percent of the people<br>we saw were young woman not just a<br>little bit drunk paralytic Lee drunk<br>right what's going on it's it's it's<br>when the good news especially with<br>pediatric stuff pediatric a facial<br>trauma has decreased over time and also<br>motor vehicle accident related trauma<br>has gone down in overtime as well this<br>is probably due to compulsory seatbelt<br>wearing wider public<br>tation and other bits and pieces there<br>however alcohol still remains the single<br>most potent cause of injuries when it<br>comes to facial fractions or facial<br>injuries so what are the general trends<br>studies show that young people are<br>over-represented especially young males<br>but young females are catching up and<br>that's disturbing alcohol it's the<br>amount how you drink and the whole<br>culture behind it of let's get seriously<br>drunk it's not let's get let's drink and<br>have a good time it's let's get<br>seriously drunk and unfortunately and<br>this is there's no evidence for this I'm<br>sorry but anecdotally the level of<br>interpersonal violence is getting worse<br>it's vicious and it's targeted when I<br>was growing up as a kid in school if you<br>wanted to have a if you want to pick a<br>fight with someone you don't hit in the<br>face and you don't hit in the private<br>bits because that's that's cowardly now<br>people really go for you and while<br>you're down they'll boot you and stamp<br>on you when has that become acceptable<br>don't know is it any different and<br>warfare well I think you're bit more<br>worried than the odd boot when you're<br>being fired upon and warfare but megs<br>zillow facial injuries have certainly<br>become more excuse the pun in your face<br>alright it's it's number two in terms of<br>the injuries seen in combat related<br>casualty routes the number one being<br>orthopaedic or limb injuries and you<br>talk about significant multi trauma<br>system multi-system trauma not just the<br>face but you're now looking at people<br>like this young man three limbs missing<br>I remember one patient when I was in<br>Kandahar three limb injuries two legs<br>one arm partially severed facial<br>injuries chase<br>injuries abdominal injuries one person<br>the good news is that have you reached<br>the role three multinational Medical<br>Center you had a ninety-seven percent<br>chance of survival but you have to ask<br>yourself at what cost this is the human<br>cost of war the current incidence if you<br>look at the UK and US data from<br>Afghanistan and Iraq is around about the<br>eighteen to twenty six percent Israeli<br>figures if you include the West Bank<br>Gaza and Lebanon it can be up to fifty<br>four percent of combat related<br>casualties however when you look at this<br>this is significantly different from<br>warfare in the past where if you average<br>out Dobson and all at all in 1989 looked<br>at 13 excuse me major conflicts over<br>time and the overall incidence of head<br>face and neck injuries was only sixteen<br>percent unusually world war two was only<br>four percent and their reasoning behind<br>that they thought it was mainly because<br>of mobile warfare more than anything<br>else so why is there an increase in<br>combat related head face and neck<br>injuries is it because people actually<br>targeting the face there are two studies<br>that show maybe one is an Indian study<br>when they looked at Special Forces in<br>the Swat Valley the other study was from<br>1993 from Mogadishu so the movie Black<br>Hawk Down that incident the main issue<br>there you had people firing down from<br>rooftops and so when soldier looking up<br>he'd face and neck injuries there's no<br>evidence that combat body armor<br>increases your risk because there was<br>one of the questions is it just the fact<br>that you're wearing body armor so Ross<br>burn and myself did a systematic review<br>you<br>can't do randomized controlled trials<br>for combat body armor so we've<br>discovered you know you wear a pillow<br>you go out there and see what happens it<br>doesn't quite happen that's quite done<br>that doesn't make that's not good good<br>military tactics what we found is that<br>it was the survivability of the combat<br>soldier current body armor is so good<br>that no rounds will penetrate it that's<br>been evidence since Mogadishu from 1993<br>it stops bullets and so what used to be<br>lethal torso injuries doesn't matter if<br>you've got facial injuries if you did<br>because we're not going to fix it so<br>these soldiers are coming in surviving<br>with horrendous injuries these<br>vulnerability of exposed areas combat<br>body armor is very good but you can't in<br>case yourself in it because there's<br>mobility there's communication issues<br>with that so that from a tactical<br>environment you need to be able to move<br>you need to be able to hear and see and<br>talk to each other so there's that age<br>old chestnut of protection versus<br>mobility but probably what's the biggest<br>thing about modern combat so called<br>asymmetric warfare is this mechanism of<br>injury it's no longer gunshot wounds<br>it's fragment and injury and it's not<br>our tillery shells not like world war<br>one we're talking about improvised<br>explosive devices linking landmines<br>together with a 155 millimeter how it's<br>a shell I mean serious firepower and<br>serious fragment dispersion so blast<br>injuries fragments and then to a lesser<br>extent gunshot wounds but the key thing<br>is soldiers are surviving in order to<br>get fixed and so when you have injuries<br>like this there's nothing read on this<br>will be fine your art is now yeah we<br>have ended up where do you start we do<br>your stuff you know what it's like<br>having a<br>was you know what it's supposed to look<br>like and you got the bits but how do you<br>actually put it together and we're very<br>lucky now that we have some idea some<br>sort of guide book you know look it up<br>on the internet sometimes all that's how<br>you do it you choose probably got stuff<br>loners you know but back in the day<br>these two men did not have YouTube or<br>reference text or even Uncle rehana<br>these guys aren't going to call it<br>rehana what I do they're going to say<br>well this is what we've got and gosh<br>would make the most of it so Harold<br>gillies you something most of you should<br>be aware of born in Dunedin 44 park<br>street at the moment his house is up for<br>sale apparently if you have a spare 3.5<br>million dollars you know there you go<br>Harold gillies was born here father of<br>modern plastic surgery prior to world<br>war one plastic surgery was not a<br>specialty was not even recognized as any<br>field of surgery as such William Kelsey<br>fry is probably the prototype of what we<br>are as an oral and maxillofacial<br>surgeons he's a dental officer medically<br>qualified and he said to Harold gillies<br>look I'll do all the hard tissue stuff<br>you do all the soft tissue stuff and so<br>what a wonderful partnership that became<br>Dunedin is forever linked with the<br>pioneering days of plastic and<br>maxillofacial surgery so here's an older<br>Harold gillies here we have [ __ ]<br>pickerel first dean of the dental school<br>first plastic surgeon in Australasia<br>coming back from the war and Archie<br>McIndoe you can tell you that as no<br>tiger graduate he's got a beer in his<br>hand you know Elliot and Rainsford malam<br>probably the least known of the of the<br>of the four pioneer surgeons from<br>Dunedin but from a clinical standpoint<br>really important because he talked about<br>cortical cancellous chip grafting so<br>it's having a big block of bone if you<br>chip it all up you actually get a much<br>better and faster healing period he<br>discovered and wrote that right that up<br>1944 that's pretty that's not yesterday<br>anyway so a huge link for plastic and<br>maxillofacial surgeries those are the<br>stuff that gillies had to contend with<br>this is this is 1914 1915 prior to<br>antibiotics right what were they using<br>for skin sutures horse here what were<br>they using for deep structures catgut<br>car belies cap gun so you talk about<br>probative stuff and no textbooks no idea<br>so it's very much art innovation and I<br>got nothing else except my hands and my<br>and what I want I'm thinking of what's<br>the next step I don't know and sure they<br>made mistakes and it's those mistakes<br>that have become principles which is<br>there are not so much that's not the<br>mistakes themselves obviously but it's<br>the prevention of those mistakes that we<br>modern surgeons now have as our dogma is<br>our teaching and it's some pretty<br>amazing stuff really when you think of<br>it I mean this even today is a very<br>challenging reconstruction now you're<br>wondering why he's got this pencil and<br>there's head that's actually a piece of<br>cartilage are buried underneath his<br>scalp to keep it alive they've got<br>nowhere else to put it so you put<br>underneath his head and then swinging<br>the pedicle flap for which gillies is<br>famous for you reconstruct the nose and<br>over time debulking the nose and okay<br>not perfect but this is very acceptable<br>you can walk down the street get married<br>have a beer looking like this but at<br>least have a bit all right<br>okay first EP crew of course being<br>dentally as well as medically qualified<br>had and being the dean of the dental<br>school had a much wider view in my<br>experience of facial reconstruction<br>because now we're talking about someone<br>we understands occlusion how teeth<br>actually fit together Wow mind-blowing<br>absolutely and he commissioned some wax<br>artworks mainly for teaching but also as<br>a reminder of the carnage of war now<br>these two models wax models are<br>currently in the Dominion sorry national<br>war museum up wellington on loan and<br>it's been acknowledged so it's from the<br>University of Otago in the school of<br>dentistry but these are works of art in<br>its own right I mean those of you who<br>are familiar with Lee Anatomy I mean<br>that's buccal fat pad made in wax and<br>paint it up now this is this is<br>seriously art for me this is really good<br>a case illustration this is a young man<br>shot through the cheek and then blasted<br>with fragment injury on death's door<br>reached New Zealand the New Zealand unit<br>our nurse back to health that just<br>wasn't doing well in terms of facial<br>fractures and not surprising because<br>that's his drawer relationship so<br>basically its entire mid face is<br>recruited a good or no good inch yeah<br>that's not for those non dent although<br>that's not how you bite all right so<br>that top jaw is totally retreated back<br>now think orthopedic think orthodontic<br>and think occlusion now wow what a<br>concept all these different things going<br>on so why don't you use track<br>to wind these facial fractures back out<br>and use the teeth as guides and so over<br>time you winding out these Jack screws<br>pulling the fractures the fractured<br>bones out and this is two years later<br>and again very acceptable obviously he's<br>had a nose job and the scar on his face<br>has been revised the spine-tingling<br>thing is we have this in the dental<br>school archives and it's the same person<br>you can tell scar on the check the the<br>shear works workmanship I mean this<br>little custom-made hand soldered it's<br>it's mind-blowing does this look<br>familiar you bet we're still using that<br>concept for craniofacial distraction<br>osteogenesis for craniofacial anomalies<br>so same concept brilliant of course when<br>we have pan facial fractures we have the<br>luxury of titanium now and all its<br>various guises we don't have to rely on<br>dental appliances and traction but guess<br>what that's we can still always go back<br>to that because that is our fallback<br>option reason why we can because it<br>works don't reinvent the wheel so even<br>though a hundred years on we have better<br>devices better equipment more resources<br>that's irrelevant what drives us today<br>is actually the principles that were<br>founded by gillies and other pioneering<br>surgeons that we sometimes take for<br>granted and it's it's sad in some ways<br>that in speaking to trainees you know do<br>you know why this is called the ghillies<br>technique there no clue whose gillies<br>and you want to strangle them because<br>you don't know about gillies ah alright<br>the set of principles do you ever know<br>alright Seto process those principles<br>that still guide us<br>and guess what 100 years lon we are<br>still using these principles for example<br>mandibular fracture management law<br>really just fractured management in<br>general but this is particular to two<br>mandibles reduce bony fractal fragments<br>fix them hold them in place make sure<br>that your anatomical spaces are correct<br>so that when you rebuild stuff you're<br>not putting things that don't fit into a<br>small space 1916 we're still doing that<br>today stuff from Afghanistan guess what<br>why are we still doing this type of free<br>pedicle graft rebuilding noses because<br>it works and especially in places like<br>Iraq and Afghanistan or it could be any<br>other place that you don't have a lot of<br>resources you stick to basic stuff that<br>works this has got a blood supply this<br>has got to survive ok what have we<br>learned from war we talked about the<br>golden hour guess what we're now talking<br>about the platinum 15 minutes right in<br>civilian trava is ear way breathing<br>circulation disability exposure but top<br>3 airway breathing circulation if you<br>can't breathe nothing else matters easy<br>in a combat situation it's March as<br>massive hemorrhage control then airway<br>because people will bleed bleed out<br>their lifeblood from their injuries they<br>don't close off the Airways or choke<br>they bleed to death so slight difference<br>in how you manage trauma initially but<br>some platinum 15 minutes damage control<br>resuscitation and surgery and we're<br>doing for time almost there yes I'm<br>blood replacement therapy we think we're<br>reinventing the wheel the Canadians<br>talked about this in World War one so<br>it's nothing real different it's just a<br>revisitation of these<br>things so this the this is a good<br>example of how clinical aspects<br>knowledge and evidence come together but<br>also how war is the greatest school of<br>surgery effects civilian trauma but<br>sometimes especially if you're working<br>in academic institution you can use your<br>civilian skills in a war environment<br>this is a young 18 month old boy was<br>second and third-degree burns to face<br>and scalp is being fed pure cream to<br>give him nutritional status nutritional<br>value trying to bulk him up there's not<br>much you can do that and that's the<br>scary thing about it if you don't skin<br>graft this kid he's got to get infected<br>and he will die however this is down to<br>bone this is lever down to bone if you<br>take that off you cannot skin graft on<br>bone he will get infected and he will<br>die this is an 18 month old civilian<br>casualty if there was a massive push and<br>we got military casualties coming out of<br>our ll is he would've been the first<br>person to get out of our combat hospital<br>shunted to the local hospital where he<br>will get infected and die so this these<br>are the things that people don't talk<br>about in the media they don't talk about<br>the feelings of I'm hanging on to this<br>kid for dear life because his life<br>depends on it these are the citizens<br>that we make in a combat hospital so<br>every two days we'll take them to breed<br>all the scar tissue and they came and<br>then wonderful stuff Don you'll be<br>familiar with as nanoparticles silver<br>particles wonderful antibacterial stuff<br>hundred bucks a sheep they didn't care<br>about prices AE what some have some<br>magnificent it will dress them and now<br>the crunch time what do we do with this<br>and this is a nervous time the whole<br>combat hospital was buzzing over this we<br>took the plunge<br>we took it off and this is beer bone now<br>civilian stuff what do we do with dental<br>implants guess what when you take a<br>piece of bone you drill holes in it and<br>then you bonk it somewhere else inside<br>the jaw why do you drill holes in it<br>because it releases growth factors<br>promotes healing and promotes<br>granulation tissue so ice hit to the<br>surgeon you know what I want to drill<br>holes in this kid's head and the entire<br>front row has the same look as by<br>surgeon colleagues that you want and<br>that's exactly what we did we drilled<br>holes in is he not right through you<br>don't drill it right through no no no no<br>no just just the top of it ten days<br>later look at that soft gold and we hope<br>the skin graft asst our nest tightest<br>who is a danish this is 63 years old at<br>that stage deployed 15 times we<br>nicknamed them the grumpy old man and he<br>said in his very danish way you know<br>this is very special and as we thought<br>it was pretty special as well and we<br>wrote it up two weeks later and it was<br>my goodbye present so that's kind of<br>neat okay sub concussion hey who would<br>have thought that cheerleading was a<br>dangerous sport but it is as you do when<br>your face park it's a silent epidemic<br>people talk about it try and ignore it<br>but as a silent epidemic 2006 almost 4<br>million people in the US alone had some<br>sort of concussive injury it's not well<br>understood and especially sub concussion<br>is not well understood or quantified<br>what does it mean for young people will<br>it affect young brains later on leading<br>to chronic traumatic a traumatic<br>encephalopathy so one of your research<br>will let's quantify this this use our<br>biomaterials by mechanical expertise at<br>the dental school let's try and capture<br>this data as you know I like doing<br>tonight<br>hitting people with bamboo sticks and in<br>him and kendo head strikes are good and<br>it's permitted so rigging up stuff this<br>is a Impact Sensor a trigger and t1 t2<br>lasers that will it's a fixed distance<br>and that will give you your velocity and<br>so that will give you a velocity and the<br>impact you get what we found when we use<br>different conditions hitting the sensor<br>is is similar to hitting be a bone then<br>we put a silicon layer mimicking scalp<br>and then we put the protective layer and<br>guess what peak impact value went down<br>but the energy that it absorbed went up<br>what does that mean in terms of what's<br>going through into your brains now I<br>think Lisa Fallon's for these photos and<br>this is the research group that Neil and<br>I are working on at the moment and now<br>the next step up from this is s build a<br>forensic head model that we can use and<br>beat instead of beating each other up<br>it's very tempting okay so prototype<br>model assembly there's a lot of work<br>here and some really amazing preliminary<br>data there is a kind of a Newton's<br>Cradle phenomenon here and part of there<br>is some teething issues with the woodley<br>with the actual model itself but what<br>you can see here is that at varying<br>levels we can detect force transmission<br>and we're trying to work and perfect<br>that at the moment the next step from<br>here is actually build and anatomical<br>here it can never be the same as a real<br>one but g was this is getting kind of<br>can't come up there what are the future<br>research implications well an Tomic all<br>models for forensic head sorry for<br>forensic research as military and sports<br>implications and so ladies and gentlemen<br>teaching service and research go hand in<br>hand<br>and especially when you can put it<br>together clinical applications it's very<br>powerful it they drive each other so<br>what's the bottom line learn from the<br>past thank you practice in the present<br>and teach for the future I want to take<br>this time to thank two very dear friends<br>who unfortunately no longer with us Phil<br>Cox well-known oral maxillofacial<br>surgeon dunedin he was my mentor and<br>life coach when I came back to Dunedin<br>never ever go running with him where I<br>just just don't it's it's like trying to<br>keep up a Ferrari it just doesn't work<br>again I own a lot in growing up as a<br>person also um Jules Kizer who was my<br>mentor in academics and research and the<br>day before he got tragically he died<br>tragically in an accident he said d your<br>year next year thanks Jules and where<br>would I be without my family why is it<br>all the photos on facebook i'm feeding I<br>don't know yeah and I just want to take<br>so thank my wife in particular yeah<br>ruined it for will your husband's<br>Thank You Daryl for your wonderful<br>presentation that was great it gave us<br>insight into the breadth of your<br>clinical and research activities and<br>showed us how the work that you've done<br>relation to war surgery and military<br>medicine has blended with your current<br>research interests in sub-concussive and<br>concussive injuries your current<br>clinical activities and particularly<br>your undergraduate and postgraduate<br>teaching and how you brought that all<br>together it was great to be reminded of<br>the immense contribution that our four<br>vears such as gillies and pickerel have<br>made and how that work that they've done<br>has been passed on to our current<br>clinicians and the all of us in the<br>population at large benefit from that so<br>Thank You Darryl very much for the<br>review of those activities and for also<br>telling us something of your personal<br>journey to get there with the help of<br>your proud and very supportive family so<br>I would like on behalf of us all to give<br>you a token of your of our appreciation<br>there is a couple of things I just have<br>to scratch free here free and the soap<br>Thank You Allison poor Mario my name is<br>Peter cramped and I'm the pro<br>vice-chancellor of health sciences and<br>it's my pleasure and my duty to wrap up<br>this evening I would like to say thank<br>you to Daryl as well that was an<br>absolutely tremendous presentation thank<br>you so much and I would also like to<br>give my special greetings to your family<br>and Catherine I have one if you will<br>indulge me one little anecdote which<br>really just reminds me when I first<br>became aware of Otago's unique history<br>in terms of maxillofacial surgery and<br>also plastic surgery prior to coming to<br>Dunedin five and a half years ago I was<br>Dean of the University of targa<br>Wellington campus and one day I was<br>chatting away to the Chief Librarian in<br>her office and I was leaning up against<br>the bookshop and I turned round and<br>glanced at the bookshelf and it was<br>covered with these wooden boxes they're<br>so big and I asked her what they were<br>they looked old and she said we'll have<br>a look inside so I took one and slid the<br>lid open and it was full of glass<br>lantern slides about that size and she<br>said now look at what they show and they<br>were in series of two or three or four<br>slides together and each one it showed a<br>series of pictures of young men with<br>horribly mutilated faces during before<br>during and after surgery and and this is<br>the pickerel collection sitting there in<br>her office and I was somewhat taken<br>aback and Darrell I don't know where<br>I'll take this opportunity a website no<br>well thank you I'm so pleased that<br>they're in the right place now this<br>exceptional collection of slide showing<br>the very birth of plastic surgery and<br>oral maxillofacial surgery right there<br>so that was my first introduction to the<br>Starion since then I've had many chats<br>to doubt about that history and the very<br>unique history which is linked to the<br>University of Otago so thank you again<br>Darrell and I'd like to thank everybody<br>here thank you to Darryl's family in<br>particular thank you to friends and<br>colleagues and members of the public for<br>being present tonight and supporting<br>Darryl in his inaugural professora<br>lecture finally I would like to invite<br>everybody to refreshments we go out of<br>this building up around that the<br>building works and across to the staff<br>club and i look forward to her<br>continuing our conversations there thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
