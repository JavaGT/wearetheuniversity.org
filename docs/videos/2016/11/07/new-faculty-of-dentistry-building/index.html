size we walk<br>down the Main Street and walk going to<br>know people and people know who you are<br>and there's kind of nice a real strong<br>sense of community and you know a really<br>big part of our community and the<br>students in the summer and students<br>aren't here it's something about today<br>then it just doesn't feel right it's<br>different it's quiet<br>and when a student's around this little<br>an added layer of life little real spark<br>that you start with and watching that<br>little spark grow into something so<br>transformation it's like a chrysalis you<br>start out with it a rough student<br>shirttails hanging out and they're not<br>really<br>they don't understand professional<br>they're not really in that space and<br>four years later and magically they turn<br>into a health kept official Dunedin is<br>an amazing place to live I lived in<br>Manchester in the UK for the last 54<br>years and we get a lot of rain on a<br>cloud coverage in Dunedin I walk out<br>every night and I can see the stars we<br>all like the students here obviously it<br>just creates set whole whole atmosphere<br>around specially on this end of town we<br>appreciate them being here 99.9 percent<br>of the time the students are a huge part<br>of us the dental school as well and I<br>think there's not many students over the<br>last four or five decades that wouldn't<br>have a story I think the captain cooks<br>have you started to neaten life and it<br>needs to stay that way<br>there they're a big part of the fix the<br>dental community we've had students that<br>have gone right through and then<br>returned and they all sort of pour and<br>here you know during the week and have<br>done four years for being here 17 years<br>now so it's really exciting for us the<br>new building going up because we're<br>gonna be you know still a part of their<br>family really if I could describe our<br>tiger university in one word it would be<br>awesome there's something about not<br>being at home travelling to dunedin to<br>study living like yo and being<br>independent it's quite liberating so<br>there's been a lot of ups and downs but<br>overall it's been an awesome experience<br>and I wouldn't change anything for the<br>world yeah I came here and did my<br>undergraduate training I look back on<br>that time as absolutely fantastic my<br>student<br>we're great it's a really supportive<br>environment here at the dental school<br>and it's also a lot of fun getting our<br>friendship and then also sort of<br>learning from everyone<br>and sort of all working together towards<br>common goals my first came here as a<br>student in 1975 and I've sort of had a<br>love affair with it ever since didn't<br>really know what I want to do with my<br>life when I wasn't going so Tiger just<br>enticed me because of its history in<br>science and education obviously the<br>student cultures so I came down and did<br>a Bachelor of Science and ended up<br>deciding to do dentistry a feud asked me<br>10 years ago what I would be doing now I<br>would have thought I was going to be in<br>practice if you told me I was going to<br>be managing a multi-million dollar<br>building project I'd have looked at you<br>rather strange younger students come in<br>I think differently they have different<br>approaches and so your teaching has to<br>change to adapt to those approaches and<br>adapt to the different learning styles<br>and I want us to be the best and we're<br>already top 20 we're planning and aiming<br>to be top 10 by 2025 and having a new<br>building and all that infrastructure can<br>only help us achieve that I think this<br>is a really exciting time to be in the<br>dental school and I'm very proud to be a<br>part of this process so be good to get<br>Dunedin and itag University up with the<br>modern technology and everything<br>grateful students great for the future<br>of Dentistry in New Zealand<br>the thing about dentistry is changed<br>rapidly with time so fast that I think<br>most other dentists was trying to keep<br>up with the technology they change if<br>you look at Dino schools in general they<br>don't seem to be very patient centric<br>almost site the patient is there by<br>accident so the key thing here is the<br>center of the universe for a dentist as<br>our patients to our amazement Sirona who<br>won the tender came back with an offer<br>to upgrade our equipment to a high<br>specification something we couldn't have<br>imagined there are very few schools on<br>the planet<br>we are an entire school is footed out<br>with high end tomorrow technology dental<br>comment just think won't be able to<br>achieve<br>the same people these exceptional<br>individuals in state of iya in a<br>state-of-the-art environment with modern<br>up-to-date equipment how can we fail to<br>excel the already excellent position<br>they're worried it's going to make this</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
