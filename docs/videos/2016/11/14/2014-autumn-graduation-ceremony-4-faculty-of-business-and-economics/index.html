achievements reflect the<br>outstanding quality not only of our<br>academic staff but also of the students<br>who work with them and the many<br>professional staff who support<br>them a key part of our challenge for the<br>future and one that is clearly reflected<br>in our strategic plan is to continue to<br>invest in a community of Highly<br>accomplished staff and<br>students an important element of that<br>investment is ensuring that our teaching<br>facilities are of the highest<br>quality to this end the council<br>completed in<br>2013 the purchase of the former lion<br>Brewery site a new market as the basis<br>for a new campus which will be<br>campuses at New Market work is well<br>underway on construction of the<br>engineering Research<br>Laboratories these buildings represent<br>an investment of approximately $88<br>million to support our engineering<br>research and post-graduate teaching for<br>the benefit of all New<br>Zealand we will occupy the first of<br>year work has also begun on the new<br>science tower on the corner of wellsly<br>and Simon<br>streets this major construction project<br>represents an investment of more than<br>$300 million<br>it will allow us to upgrade Science<br>teaching and research and integrate the<br>School of Psychology and the school of<br>environment into the main science<br>Precinct this will in turn free up the<br>human Sciences building for<br>faculty constant Innovation is the<br>Cornerstone of a university such as<br>ours Innovative teaching and research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth of our country and social<br>cohesion of our<br>nation this has never been more so in<br>the testing times we face in the wake of<br>the global recession the Christ Church<br>earthquakes and the yet to be defined<br>warming universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined in an never changing world<br>so as you graduate today please reflect<br>on the ongoing learning opportunities<br>and consider the wide range of<br>postgraduate options available to you at<br>this<br>University reflect on the changes in<br>technology you have already experienced<br>in your lifetime and remember that most<br>of the technology you will use in your<br>future working career has yet to be<br>developed

world I urge you as the<br>alumni of New Zealand's leading<br>University to never forget your alamata<br>your<br>University we rely on our graduates for<br>support moral political and<br>Financial

universities not less so don't worry<br>we will be in touch with you and when we<br>support but that is enough of the<br>substantial issues facing us all as<br>members of a 21st century University<br>with high<br>aspirations because today is your day<br>with a focus firmly on your<br>achievement at this ceremony we'll honor<br>your success along with the support of<br>your family far

heartiest congratulations to our<br>graduates accomplished celebrated<br>intelligent Sparks of pure<br>potentiality it's an extraordinary honor<br>and Delight to be with you all<br>today here in New Zealand over 20 years<br>since going to live in New York I can't<br>help but be moved by being back in this<br>country and at this University both of<br>which played a deeply formative role<br>that prepared me for many later<br>challenges and<br>opportunities you can leave New Zealand<br>but New Zealand never leaves<br>you I'm sure you two will look back in<br>years to come as I constantly do<br>recalling your time at Orland University<br>is some of the most wonderful moments of<br>your<br>lives with due credit to David Foster<br>Wallace from whom I've borrowed and<br>adapted this I'd like to share with you<br>a little<br>Fable imagine two young Native New<br>Zealand Birds chattering at top a<br>beautiful poto cow<br>tree their playful banter is abruptly<br>cut short when an older relative imagine<br>you know an annoying Uncle from roro or<br>something like that flies up and joins<br>them good day fellas he exclaims how's<br>the air up here<br>the young birds look at each other<br>puzzled and then one retorts to the<br>air let's reflect upon the message<br>here as we proceed through life it's<br>easy to begin taking things for granted<br>to become complacent and simply not<br>perceive the stuff around us that<br>enables us to live and<br>breathe when learning to fly young birds<br>must negotiate the critical relationship<br>with a but once the skill feels mastered<br>the relevance of the air in which birds<br>inconsequence I'd like to suggest to you<br>that air for all of us here today is a<br>worthy ongoing metaphor and I'm going to<br>stretch the metaphor throughout this<br>this<br>talk for one thing in New Zealand where<br>clean and fresh air is found in relative<br>abundance we often don't realize how<br>precious a commodity air really<br>is but I'm interested in another<br>interpretation of<br>air we can also consider that a first<br>class tertiary education such as the one<br>we've been privileged to receive at o<br>University is also a form of<br>air an elemental experience meant to<br>continuously refresh and oxygenate the<br>spirit<br>education like air<br>is something we must never disregard nor<br>forget in an age where everything tends<br>to be commodified or treated<br>instrumentally as a means to an end we<br>lose sight of significant aspects of<br>what an education stands for such as its<br>relationship to contemplative to the<br>contemplative life of the mind and the<br>responsibilities that come with it for<br>the Ancients this was a<br>given education and intellectual virtue<br>are ends in themselves<br>and freighted with serious moral<br>purpose for this point too Birds provide<br>important<br>lessons in their long migrations birds<br>fly in V or J<br>formations conserving energy by taking<br>advantage of windfields created when the<br>wing motions of their fellows in front<br>help Propel the ones behind<br>along when those at the head of the<br>formation Tire other birds Take the Lead<br>their actions helping others in the<br>flock the efforts of the leaders<br>contributing to pulling along all the<br>others this image perhaps reflects part<br>of the moral purpose of an<br>education it prescribes a duty to<br>contribute positively putting knowledge<br>to work in a responsible way in the<br>service not only of ourselves but for<br>good one of the misunderstandings that<br>sometimes arises when you come from a<br>small and Airy country is the idea of<br>not mattering of being Irrelevant in the<br>larger World here again we must remember<br>our two young birds on top of the POA<br>tree air that stuff in which we move can<br>simply never not concern us we change<br>our air by the way we navigate through<br>it creating various kinds of Ripples and<br>slipstreams whatever we do has relevance<br>for the people around us and the broader<br>Society RIT<br>large and so it is with how we choose to<br>live the goals we set and the purposes<br>ourselves from the time of the great<br>migration of the mai to a kiwis have<br>been venturing into unknown lands and<br>excelling this is an enduring National<br>ethos consider notable new zealanders<br>Edmund Hillary Katherine Mansfield Lord<br>Ernest ruford kir tanoa grahe ligins the<br>list goes on and on all these people<br>stage at the same time being<br>geographically removed from Global Group<br>think has distinct<br>advantages new zealanders are possessed<br>of a unique sense of<br>proportion practicality creativity and<br>common sense it's imperative we never<br>lose what's distinct and special about<br>New Zealand and incumbent upon you the<br>future generation to ensure that New<br>Zealand does not allow itself to<br>Stray by forgetting what is our air and<br>thereby replicating dystopian social<br>realities found elsewhere in the<br>world untenable circumstances are<br>commonplace from dark social<br>inequalities to massive indebtedness<br>political corruption food and water<br>insecurities Environmental degreg<br>all these things we know too much<br>about those of you who become Future<br>Leaders must try to develop more<br>sustainable ways of being both social<br>economic and political cognizant of how<br>aspects in contemporary life have placed<br>slope my connection to New Zealand was a<br>lucky accident at 15 I wanted to go away<br>to boarding school and had never been to<br>New Zealand which was maybe part of the<br>appeal But ultimately I can probably<br>credit coming here also on a<br>bird I was around six or seven when a<br>kiwi friend of my parents gave me a<br>vinyl EP of alwin Owens poy and the<br>birds singing contest I don't know if<br>any of you know it this introduced me to<br>the idea of New Zealand I can't really<br>remember much of a plot but the song of<br>the Tui on the record which went<br>something like<br>this um is still lodged in my<br>mind this random encounter with New<br>Zealand Birds turned into an<br>education and this carries a lesson for<br>me life is as much about lucky<br>coincidences and confluences as it is<br>about purposeful effort and active<br>agency we must learn how to comi combine<br>conscious effort with natural<br>progression properly using your wings is<br>important but then there are air<br>currents that come out of nowhere which<br>catch you and cause you to S gliding and<br>ascending to Heights you could never<br>imagine and all the while as we travel<br>we must have an ongoing sense of<br>gratitude for those things that are our<br>air their quality and buoyancy literally<br>and and<br>figuratively we should also ever<br>recognize and acknowledge the array of<br>facts some solidly positive some bad<br>even that cannot be taken for granted<br>granted or<br>ignored this is how we open ourselves up<br>to concrete and Abstract qualities that<br>constitute our air making and remaking<br>ourselves in the existential flight<br>called<br>life before concluding I'd like to share<br>a quick piece of information make a note<br>of a<br>number<br>09 215<br>6754 it's for a place on K happy Road<br>where you can go to get your
