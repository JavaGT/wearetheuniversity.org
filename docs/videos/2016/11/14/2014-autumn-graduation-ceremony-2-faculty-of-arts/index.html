reflected<br>in our strategic plan is to continue to<br>invest in a community of Highly<br>accomplished staff and<br>students an important element of that<br>investment is ensuring that our teaching<br>facilities are of the highest<br>quality to this end the council<br>completed in<br>2013 the purchase of the former lion<br>Brewery site in New Market as the basis<br>for a new campus which will be<br>integrated with the existing City and<br>Grafton<br>campuses at New Market work is well<br>underway on construction of the<br>engineering Research<br>Laboratories these buildings represent<br>an investment of approximately 88<br>million to support our dollars that is<br>to support our engineering research and<br>postgraduate teaching for the benefit of<br>all New Zealand we will occupy the first<br>year work has also begun on a new<br>science tower on the corner of Wellsley<br>and Simon streets this major<br>construction project represents an<br>investment of more than $300<br>million it would allow us to upgrade<br>Science teaching and research and and<br>integrate the School of Psychology and<br>the school of environment into one main<br>science pre<br>Precinct this will in turn free up the<br>human science building for refurbishment<br>faculty constant Innovation is the<br>Cornerstone of a university such as ours<br>Innovative teaching and research

members of the University<br>graduates families and<br>friends congratulations to all the<br>graduates receiving degrees I hope you<br>take time today to reflect on the hard<br>work and perseverance you've displayed<br>in obtaining your degrees I hope that<br>today you also enjoy your achievement<br>and celebrate it with your families and<br>friends your life is full of<br>possibilities now many of which you<br>can't even imagine yet certainly when I<br>had to study constitutional law as a<br>compulsory paper in my law degree I<br>thought it was a complete waste of time<br>and I would never use it I couldn't have<br>imagined then that I would later work as<br>a political reporter in the Press<br>Gallery when MMP was being introduced an<br>understanding of constitutional law was<br>accordingly extremely<br>useful as you progress on your journey<br>through life I hope you'll hang on to<br>your dreams and keep pursuing them one<br>of the main things I've learned over the<br>years is that determination and<br>persistence are the most important<br>qualities you can have you can achieve<br>an awful lot if you just keep working<br>steadfastly towards your goals<br>lots of people will tell you that you<br>can't do things or that things are<br>impossible don't be discouraged by them<br>instead listen to the people who<br>encourage you and if there aren't any<br>listen to your inner<br>voice if I'd listened to what people<br>said to me I would certainly be a lot<br>better off financially and I might have<br>some important titles but I wouldn't be<br>satisfied inside myself<br>maybe as you enjoy your special day<br>today you'll also take time to reflect<br>on how lucky you are and what a<br>privilege it is to receive a tertiary<br>education I worked as a duty lawyer at<br>the manaco district court for 11 years<br>every Monday at 8:00 a.m. I went down to<br>the cells under the court to speak to<br>people who'd been<br>arrested I always remember particularly<br>17 year old males I met in the cells<br>many of them couldn't read and write<br>they had no skills and no<br>qualifications because of that they also<br>had no jobs and no<br>self-esteem worse they had no hope in<br>their lives no goals and no<br>dreams I've also acted for many young<br>women who've been victims of domestic<br>violence one woman I obtained a<br>protection order for came to see me in<br>my office office a couple of years later<br>she told me that she was studying she<br>wanted to finish school and then go on<br>to tertiary<br>education she was getting good marks and<br>I told her that she was doing<br>wonderfully well but her violent ex<br>partner was telling her that she was a<br>bad mother because she was leaving her<br>baby with someone else while she went to<br>classes I realized that this young woman<br>hadn't come back to see me because she<br>wanted to talk to me about a legal issue<br>she was in my office because I was the<br>only person in her life she thought<br>might give her some encouragement to<br>continue<br>studying in our society much of our<br>esteem comes from our jobs people who<br>are shut out of jobs are also shut out<br>of the community as a<br>whole and that's not just a problem in<br>New<br>Zealand<br>774 million people in the world world<br>are illiterate more than 10% of the<br>people on the planet and at least 80% of<br>people in the world live on less than<br>$10 a day 1.1 billion people have an<br>adequate access to water and 2.6 billion<br>lack basic<br>sanitation some 1.8 million children die<br>every year from<br>diarrhea those are depressing statistics<br>but in the last 20 years almost 1<br>billion people have been lifted out of<br>extreme poverty that's an astonishing<br>figure countries working together to<br>implement the Millennium development<br>goals manag to reduce extreme poverty by<br>half 5 years ahead of the planned<br>Target nations are now working to have<br>the proportion of people who suffer from<br>Hunger encouragingly that Target Within<br>Reach by next<br>year so I hope that as you enjoy today<br>and plan for your future you might also<br>consider how you can contribute to<br>improving the<br>world the most satisfaction I've found<br>in my life is not from the highest<br>paying job or from the most impressive<br>title it's been from helping<br>others by earning your degree you've<br>shown that you have intelligence a good<br>work ethic and determined<br>ation many young people like you working<br>together could make huge strides to<br>reducing poverty and illiteracy in the<br>world maybe that's something you'll<br>you thank you Katrina for most<br>insightful speech could you all join<br>Katrina this is the meeting of
