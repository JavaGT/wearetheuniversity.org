our challenge for the future<br>is and one that is clearly reflected in<br>our strategic plan is to continue to<br>invest in a community of Highly<br>accomplished staff and<br>students an important element of that<br>investment is ensuring that our teaching<br>facilities of the highest<br>quality to this<br>end the university Council completed in<br>2013 the purchase of the former lion<br>Brewery site and New Market as the basis<br>for a new campus which will inter which<br>will be integrated with the existing<br>campuses at the new market site work is<br>well underway on

Psychology and<br>the school of environment into the main<br>science<br>Precinct this will in turn free up the<br>human Sciences building for<br>faculty constant Innovation is the<br>Cornerstone of a university such as<br>ours Innovative teaching and research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth of our country and social<br>cohesion of our<br>nation this has never been more so

to lecture to<br>some of the students um graduates today<br>I'm been involved with um undergraduate<br>training with p students with fourth and<br>uh fifth uh sixth year medical students<br>and and then going on and being involved<br>with po postgraduate training so it's<br>it's for those reasons that I'm um here<br>excited about being here<br>tonight I um as well as been here<br>to um and just make a little note yeah 4<br>hours ago I was running around a lake in<br>Kai Tha and WAMU you you you know what<br>I'm talking about um and you know we're<br>able to come down here tonight and share<br>in in this wonderful opportunity and<br>it's I believe it's a really important<br>part of what I do in my little community<br>in Kaya which is trying to or is<br>displaying leadership um Health<br>leadership Community leadership cultural<br>leadership and and medical leadership so<br>it's a continuation of of what I am<br>wanting to do and passionate about doing<br>I'm also here tonight as well as um<br>patting you on the back and saying well<br>done is s for a little bit of a<br>challenge okay so I'm I'm I'm here to um<br>you know this is a wonderful evening to<br>celebrate the opportunity you have to<br>embark on a career in health and with<br>this there's a responsibility to ensure<br>that skills and passion that you have<br>can best serve our communities our<br>peoples in our<br>country I I would like to talk to you<br>about a concept that resonates uh with<br>me as I hope it will with uh many of you<br>and it's a philosophy of servant<br>leadership and I first heard this from<br>another uh University of Oakland uh alus<br>um Pat sneden Mr Pat sneden um a number<br>of years ago and I I think it gave a<br>name and a title and a and a a concept<br>to what I believe I have been wanting to<br>display from the time I entered into<br>Medical School through to this time so<br>I'm going to give you a little bit of a<br>definition of this concept of servant<br>leadership so if you've heard this<br>before I apologize but it's exciting so<br>hear me out so the servant leaders<br>leader is a servant first so it begins<br>with a natural feeling that one wants to<br>serve to serve first then a conscious<br>Choice conscious decision brings one to<br>Aspire to lead that person is quite<br>different from one who is a leader<br>first who perhaps because of a need to<br>assuage an unusual power drive or to<br>acquire material possessions the leader<br>first and the servant first are two<br>quite different types of leadership so<br>the difference is in the care taken by<br>the servant first to make sure that<br>other people's highest priorities<br>priority needs are being served the best<br>test is do these those served grow as<br>persons uh do they while being served<br>become healthier wiser Freer more<br>autonomous more likely themselves to<br>become<br>servants and what is the effect on the<br>least privileged in<br>society will they benefit or at least<br>not be further<br>deprived it may be apparent to some of<br>you already that this is a pathway<br>forwards for you and for some others it<br>may be a New<br>Concept I'm going to list a number of<br>characteristics that are considered to<br>reflect that of a servant leader<br>listening a servant leader puts the<br>emphasis upon listening effectively to<br>others empathy a servant leader needs to<br>understand others feelings and<br>perspectives<br>healing a servant leader helps Foster<br>each person's emotional and spiritual<br>health and<br>wholeness awareness a servant leader<br>understands his or own her own values<br>and and feelings strengths and<br>weaknesses<br>persuasion a servant leader influences<br>others through their<br>persuasiveness we might call this<br>advocacy<br>conceptualization a servant leader needs<br>to integrate present realities and<br>future<br>possibilities foresight a servant leader<br>needs to be to have a well-developed<br>sense of intuition and how the past the<br>present and future are<br>connected<br>stewardship a servant leader is a<br>steward who holds an organization's<br>resources and Trust for the greater<br>good commitment to the growth of people<br>a servant leader is responsible for<br>serving the need of<br>others building<br>community and this is the final<br>one a servant leader is to help is to<br>help create a sense of community among<br>among people now when I read this you<br>know I've I've been an advocate for this<br>um concept for<br>while and I and I knew I was coming here<br>tonight to talk I thought well that<br>pretty much<br>encapsulates everything about the people<br>in this room that are um graduating from<br>Health Sciences faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences all of those things<br>healing listening um advocacy all of<br>these things in stewardship you know we<br>are stewards for you know the current<br>those working in the current health<br>system are stewards stewards for you<br>when you come on and and we can pass<br>over the Reigns and the mental to you<br>and I and that's<br>exciting so um you know I think this<br>these um characteristics of servant<br>leadership describe the careers that you<br>have all chosen to be um to graduate<br>from tonight and and embarking on<br>tonight so I um I believe that we have a<br>great country where we've been fortunate<br>enough to be given a world-class<br>education we have opportunity and<br>responsibility to take this skill and<br>apply this to contribute to building a<br>greater New Zealand I believe that we<br>have the responsibility to use our<br>skills to serve our people in New<br>Zealand and not chase the better<br>Lifestyles<br>overseas I believe we have an obligation<br>to apply our efforts to the to the<br>patients and the people that access our<br>respective health services and our<br>greatest efforts to those with the<br>greatest needs who cannot access our<br>health system I believe that this is the<br>start of a wonderful Journey for you all<br>tonight and a conclusion of a chapter in<br>your life in the life of your loved ones<br>and yourselves who could say we did it I<br>believe that you all have an important<br>task to ensure that you remain you you<br>remain<br>connected connected with your<br>communities con connected with your<br>peers connected with others working for<br>the same goal in the health system and<br>connected with the needs of our country<br>I believe that some of you will have the<br>opportunity to one day take time away<br>from your community that means a lot to<br>you and travel to congratulate another<br>group of inspirational graduates<br>contributing to the prospect of a<br>Zealand I want to thank you once again<br>the university and on the families and<br>of course most importantly um all of you<br>tonight the gradu to the opportunity to<br>come along here tonight and celebrate<br>this time with you I hope my speech<br>might leave you with something to think<br>about regarding what your career pathway<br>may look like and how you may use these<br>skills that you've acquired tonight for<br>the the greater good of our<br>country and uh I just um wish wish you<br>all the best for the future and look<br>forward to seeing you in our hospitals<br>in our community ities like<br>thank you Dr Sullivan for a most<br>interesting and challenging address can<br>you join with me in thanking n once more<br>presentation
