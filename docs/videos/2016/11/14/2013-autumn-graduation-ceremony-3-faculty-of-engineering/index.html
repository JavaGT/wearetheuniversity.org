Presenting our graduates from the Faculty of Engineering.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>this is our third ceremony today and<br>this ceremony is for the faculty of<br>engineering but firstly on behalf of the<br>University I'd like to apologize to you<br>all for those of you who are hoping to<br>attend a graduation procession today we<br>don't take the decision to cancel these<br>processions lightly and unfortunately<br>the forecast had said thunder lightning<br>torrential rain and big storms and of<br>course anybody with the remote<br>scientific background will understand<br>that we would have formed one great big<br>giant lightning rod walking down the<br>street so unfortunately we had to make<br>the decision to cancel the procession<br>I'm very sorry it's I think it's only<br>the second time in about 80 years that<br>that's happened but you're all here and<br>that's probably why so thank you for<br>coming your students or gradu will be<br>coming in very soon please feel free to<br>take photographs when they're coming in<br>and when they're on the stage but please<br>also be considerate of all the other<br>guests around you if you're going to<br>stand up and take the photograph please<br>make sure you sit back down again fairly<br>promptly the students will process in<br>very shortly followed by the academics<br>who will sit on stage followed by our<br>official party and during that we'll<br>have a singer singing gamos the words<br>will be on your program at this point<br>you'll all still be standing now is a<br>great time for you to switch off your<br>mobile phone because we don't want that<br>going off in the middle of the<br>ceremony and at the end of the ceremony<br>we'll all sing the national anthem<br>together with your<br>graduates when the official party leaves<br>we'll then get the graduates to leave<br>please wait until all the graduates have<br>left before following them out into the<br>foyer ladies and Gentlemen please stand<br>gradin<br>l<br>oh<br>e<br>were<br>in<br>inor<br>spe<br>fore<br>foree<br>seated<br>otoo Vice<br>Chancellor pro-chancellor<br>council members special guests<br>staff graduan<br>family and friends of<br>graduan as Chancellor of the University<br>of Orland I extend a warm welcome to you<br>all on behalf of University council<br>members and staff of the<br>university in particular I welcome our<br>pervan this is a meeting of the Council<br>of the University of ockland for the<br>purpose of conferring degrees and<br>awarding<br>diplomas this week we will be conferring<br>and awarding more than 7,000<br>qualifications on some 6,000 400<br>students in person and In<br>Absentia at this ceremony 506 students<br>will graduate in person and 96 students<br>absens I will be assisted by Mr Peter<br>Kylie pro-chancellor in the awarding of<br>degrees this is a happy and memorable<br>occasion for you the<br>graduan as well as your families and<br>friends who have supported you during<br>your<br>studies we congratulate you<br>all equally your achievement brings<br>pleasure and satisfaction to the<br>academic and professional staff of the<br>University who have played their part in<br>at this point in my welcome I was going<br>to say that the graduation procession<br>today had bought academic flavor and<br>color to the streets of Oakland<br>unfortunately the rain this morning put<br>an end to that but in this ceremony you<br>will experience the PO the Pomp and<br>tradition benefiting your well-deserved<br>Celebration over a period of 130 years<br>the University of walk has become a<br>comprehensive research Le University<br>with a strong International<br>reputation today there are more than<br>40,000 students and 5,000<br>staff moreover we are New Zealand's<br>largest research<br>organization with onethird of the<br>country's externally rated worldclass<br>researchers within New Zealand only our<br>University is ranked within the top 1%<br>of the world's<br>universities we also have a strong<br>commitment to Mai<br>education of all the mai degree<br>graduates in New Zealand each year 25%<br>come from just one<br>ockland we jealously guard our position<br>amongst our competitor universities and<br>are always looking to create new<br>opportunities for all of our<br>undergraduate and postgraduate<br>students<br>last month we confirmed the purchase of<br>the 5.2 hectare former lion Brewery site<br>on Kaiba<br>pass this purchase will provide the<br>university with the site for expansion<br>over the next 50 years contiguous with<br>the city and Grafton campuses and with<br>the major business area in New Market it<br>will have a huge impact on the faculty<br>of<br>engineering and we will we look to<br>occupy the first of the new facilities<br>2014 so as you graduate please reflect<br>on ongoing learning opportunities and<br>consider the wide range of postgraduate<br>options available to you at<br>Oakland I ask you to consider that<br>because we can never rest on our Laurels<br>especially in a challenging and<br>everchanging<br>World whatever path you follow I urge<br>you as the alumni of New Zealand's unud<br>leading University to never forget your<br>Elma<br>mat we rely on our graduates for support<br>moral political and<br>Financial Funding constraints are a<br>perennial problem for New Zealand<br>universities who are being asked to do<br>more and more with less and less each<br>year in fact in these hard times we<br>should be spending more on universities<br>not<br>less but that is enough of the of the<br>substantial issues facing us all as<br>members of a 21st century University<br>with high<br>aspirations because today is your day<br>with a focus firmly on your<br>achievement at this ceremony we will<br>honor your success along with the<br>support of your family Fara and others<br>who have sustained you through your<br>studies I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long cherish the memories<br>today I am delighted to welcome as our<br>guest speaker Mr Michael pervan who is<br>the general manager at altitude<br>Aerospace<br>Interiors part of the New Zealand

for<br>GTL owners please join with me in<br>welcoming<br>Michael Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor Pro Chancellor Dean staff<br>honored guests<br>gradu family and<br>friends it is an honor to be here today<br>to address you as the CL class of<br>2013 when I was asked by the university<br>to speak here today I thought cool I can<br>address a bunch of young Engineers I do<br>that pretty much every<br>day but then I<br>realized this was<br>different it's not about tomorrow's<br>targets and next year's aims this is<br>about one of the biggest moments in a<br>person's<br>life it was back in 1989 for me<br>so what message do I do I want to leave<br>with you before you all get too<br>agitated uh waiting to have your turn on<br>the podium I want to leave you with a<br>message of Hope and expectations that we<br>have of you into the<br>future you have achieved an amazing<br>accomplishment no matter where you have<br>started from whether as the first in<br>your family to graduate or as the next<br>in the line of a family of academic<br>Achievers Society your family and your<br>own hard work have given you a very<br>privileged position one of immense<br>knowledge and<br>ability the world I graduated in was one<br>of economic turmoil growing computer<br>usage and Rapid technological<br>advances remember the crash of ' 87<br>the Sinclair electric car<br>anyone think big energy<br>projects maybe<br>not the country I graduated in was<br>primarily an agrarian<br>economically and it was proud of its<br>fresh green<br>image in some ways it hasn't<br>changed but it<br>has it's got<br>tougher it's got faster<br>it's got bigger and quite often all of<br>the<br>above now you have this newly acquired<br>knowledge and ability what can you do to<br>make a difference for our economy our<br>environment our quality of<br>life first be<br>proud but I'd also like you to be loud<br>that as Engineers we are here to make a<br>difference because those who preed you<br>have made a huge difference but we have<br>not always made too much noise about<br>it we must make more noise as a<br>profession for we cannot expect the<br>public business and politicians to fund<br>our endeavors to improve the world if we<br>don't make them aware of what we have<br>done and what we can<br>do I know many of you went into<br>engineering because you like technology<br>you're pretty good at maths chemistry<br>and<br>physics not necessarily to go and change<br>the<br>world but you<br>will and not always in the engineering<br>field<br>either often as bankers and Business<br>Leaders politicians and public<br>servants this is where your ability to<br>make sense of and solve complex problems<br>will make you a powerful facilitator of<br>change<br>but remember change is not about<br>people and therefore as we expect you to<br>go and create new and Innovative<br>High-Tech high value businesses that<br>create wealth for our<br>country solve great infrastructural<br>challenges that improve our quality of<br>life andove remove environmental hazard<br>to secure our planet for the<br>it I'd like to give you a little<br>anecdote of just how hard that may be at<br>times this is<br>personal recently I took my niece young<br>niece and nephew to the motat aviation<br>uh<br>Hall great environment I thought to show<br>them what their Uncle does and creating<br>technology that flies Eight Miles High<br>the speed of the<br>bullet and my niece and nephew were very<br>politely wanded around the Halles with<br>me and<br>then my nephew leans over very quietly<br>to his father and says so where are the<br>fast<br>me was my<br>niece four-year-old she saw that glass<br>escalator or alligator as you like to<br>call it and that was a highlight of her<br>tour so it's not always easy to<br>communicate technology and what we do<br>and how we do it but you have to<br>try as a colleague of mine reminds us<br>occasionally back in the<br>1970s before any of you were<br>born or most of you at the engineering<br>school we used to have a chant<br>and in some ways that catches what we<br>need to do although at times I have to<br>say the chant was probably a little<br>misunderstood but we must raise it again<br>it goes we are we are the ockland<br>engineers and I would like to add we are<br>we are here to make a difference in our<br>careers I know this is a great Challenge<br>and responsibility but you are up for it<br>because those who went before you have<br>proven it's<br>possible we know you are and we are also<br>extremely proud of your achievements<br>today the ones we know but also the ones<br>future finally I'd like to have say a<br>big thank you to all who have supported<br>taught and guided the graduan through to<br>this Monumental<br>achievement your efforts will not go<br>unrewarded<br>in<br>conclusion I join everyone here in<br>offering you my most sincere<br>congratulations to the class of<br>applause<br>thank you

faculty<br>of<br>engineering teaching excellence awards<br>the university places considerable<br>significance on excellence in teaching<br>it recognizes this by making Awards each<br>year to teachers who have demonstrated<br>excellence in aspects of<br>teaching these awards are contestable<br>across the university and signify a<br>achievement today we're making an award<br>for sustained excellence in teaching and<br>it goes to associate professor Brian e<br>James in the department of chemical<br>materials engineering within the faculty<br>of<br>engineering I call upon a student of<br>that faculty mat imp to read the<br>James I am delighted that Bry James is a<br>recipient of this teaching Excellence<br>award uh when I recall my first year of<br>study Bri Material Science class stands<br>out as my most rewarding and truly<br>enjoyable time although her time with<br>our class was brief br's impact was<br>remarkable briy recognized how<br>challenging first year tertiary study<br>could be and she tried continuously to<br>make each lecture engaging and highly<br>rewarding whilst encouraging class<br>involvement and discussion baran's<br>passion for her subject and enthusiasm<br>in teaching were infectious and soon we<br>were all just as keen on Material<br>Sciences<br>is this this enthusiasm was demonstrated<br>through the remarkable resourcefulness<br>which browny showed in providing a<br>visual demonstration for every concept<br>covered in every lecture these provided<br>an extremely valuable tactile example<br>and pneumonics for memory of for the<br>more challenging<br>Concepts the consideration taken in<br>crafting her lectures was also evident<br>in Brian's material itself as she<br>endeavored to impart as much knowledge<br>as possible whilst taking great care to<br>ensure her lectures were concise and<br>understandable and that she engaged each<br>of the various learning styles contained<br>such a large<br>class perhaps the most Innovative of<br>Brian's methods was her utilization of<br>Post-it notes as a feedback medium briy<br>would hand out Post-it notes to the<br>class and these would be questions<br>written on them and then a fix to the<br>door at the<br>conclusion this Anonymous and simple<br>method led to a level of student<br>engagement and discussion that's<br>unparalleled in anything I've seen since<br>this method of communication allowed for<br>a certain charm as well as encouraging<br>formal discussions promoting free and<br>open conversation in the class and uh C<br>certain opportunity of<br>humor uh Bri's major strength lay in her<br>untiring efforts to make her lectures as<br>rewarding as possible for her class this<br>wholehearted commitment to her students<br>was highly appreciated and I am very<br>pleased to have the opportunity to<br>congratulate brannie James as she<br>receives this thoroughly deserved<br>teaching<br>award<br>we're now nearing the conclusion of this<br>graduation<br>ceremony on behalf of the University I<br>invite all today's graduates to stand<br>all<br>this would also be a great time for the<br>graduates to show their appreciation of<br>their families and supporters and the<br>staff on the University who've helped<br>qualifications this concludes this<br>meeting of council and convocation of<br>the University for the confirmant of<br>degrees and the award of<br>diplomas I now invite you to stand and<br>sing the first verse of God defend New<br>Zealand in MA then in English the words<br>are presented on the reverse of
