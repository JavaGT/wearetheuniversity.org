this<br>ceremony you will experience the Pomp<br>and tradition befitting your<br>Celebration over a period of 130 years<br>the University of walkand has become a<br>comprehensive research Le University<br>with a strong International<br>reputation today there are more than<br>40,000 students in 5,000<br>staff moreover we are New Zealand's<br>largest research<br>organization with onethird of the<br>country's externally rated world-class<br>researchers within New Zealand only our<br>University is ranked within the top 1%<br>of the world's<br>universities we also have a strong<br>commitment to m educ education of all<br>the M degree graduates in New Zealand<br>each year 25% come from just one<br>institution the University of Oakland<br>for Pacifica students the number is more<br>like<br>40% the quality and international<br>reputation of a university are<br>fundamentally driven by the achievements<br>of its people and last year was an<br>exceptional one for our academic<br>staff who won almost every form of<br>recognition available to them in New<br>Zealand in July Professor Allison Jones<br>and Associate professors briany James<br>and kther Simpson won national tery tery<br>teaching excellence awards for sustained<br>excellence in tertiary<br>teaching these Awards mean that for the<br>last 11 of sorry these Awards mean that<br>for 11 of the last 12 years our teachers<br>have been recognized as among the very<br>best in the<br>country in November Engineers<br>distinguished ameritus professor John<br>Boy and Professor Grant kovic won the<br>Supreme award at the prime minister's<br>science prizes awards for their work on<br>inductive power<br>transfer Dr Ben O'Brien from the Orland<br>bioengineering Institute won the mcdi<br>emerging scientist prize for his<br>groundbreaking work on artificial<br>muscles and and Dr Susie WS from<br>molecular medicine and pathology won the<br>science Media communication<br>prize our staff also excelled at the<br>2013 Royal Society of New Zealand Awards<br>winning four major<br>medals the most notable was<br>distinguished Professor Dam man seon<br>from Mai studies winning the society's<br>highest honor the Rutherford<br>metal this was awarded for her eminent<br>work on Marty social structures and<br>interactions within the European world<br>and on European exploration in the<br>Pacific she was also named kiwi Bank New<br>2013 these achievements reflect the<br>outstanding quality not only of academic<br>staff but also of the students who work<br>with them and the many professional<br>staff who support them a key part of our<br>challenge for the future and one that is<br>clearly reflected in our iic plan is to<br>continue to invest in a community of<br>Highly accomplished staff and<br>students an important element of that<br>investment is that ensuring that our<br>teaching facilities are of the highest<br>quality to this end the council<br>completed in<br>2013 the purchase of the former lion<br>breweries site in New Market as the<br>basis for a new campus which will be<br>integrated with the existing City and<br>graft<br>campuses at New Market work is well<br>underway on construction of the<br>engineering Research<br>Laboratories these buildings represent<br>an investment of approximately $88<br>million to support our engineering<br>research and postgraduate teaching for<br>the benefit of all New<br>Zealand we will occupy the first of the<br>new facilities in July this year and<br>this facility is really impressive when<br>viewed from the road<br>work has also begun on the new science<br>tower on the corner of wellis and Simon<br>streets this major construction project<br>represents an investment of more than<br>$300<br>million it will allow us to upgrade<br>Science teaching and research and<br>integrate the School of Psychology and<br>the school of environment into the main<br>science<br>Precinct this will in turn free up the<br>human Sciences building for<br>refurbishment as the center of the Arts<br>faculty<br>constant Innovation is the Cornerstone<br>of a university such as ours Innovative<br>teaching and research is vital for<br>long-term sustainable economic growth of<br>our country and social cohesion of our<br>nation this had never been more so than<br>the testing Economic Times we face in<br>the wake of the global recession the<br>Christ Church earthquakes and the yet to<br>be defined effects of global warming<br>universities equip graduates like you<br>not simply for the jobs of today but for<br>future careers not yet imagined in an<br>world so as you graduate today please<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and consider the wide<br>range of post-graduate options available<br>to you at this<br>University reflect on the changes in<br>technology you have experienced in your<br>lifetime and remember that most of the<br>technology you will use in your working<br>career has yet to be developed or<br>commercialized I ask you to do this<br>because we can never rest on our Laurels<br>especially in a challenging and Ever<br>Changing<br>World whatever path you follow as you go<br>out into the world I urge you as the<br>alumni of New Zealand's un leading<br>University to never forget your Elma<br>matter your<br>University we rely on our graduates for<br>support moral political and<br>Financial Funding constraints are a<br>perennial problem for New Zealand<br>universities who are being asked to do<br>more and more with less and less each<br>year in fact in these times we should be<br>spending more on universities not less<br>so don't worry we will be in touch with<br>you when we do please lend us your<br>support<br>but that is enough of the substantial<br>issues facing us all as members of a<br>21st century University with high<br>aspirations because today is your<br>day with the focus firmly on your<br>achievement at this ceremony we honor<br>your success along with the support of<br>your family far now and others who have<br>sustained you through your<br>studies I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long sh cherish the<br>today I am pleased to extend a warm<br>welcome to this morning's speaker Andrew<br>Patterson who was both a graduate and a<br>student of the University of<br>ockland having graduated with a Commerce<br>degree majoring in economics and<br>business strategy he returned to the<br>University's business school to study<br>for his Masters in Business<br>commercialization and<br>Entrepreneurship Andrew has very<br>successfully B his qualifications and<br>interests together and now maintains a<br>portfolio including broadcasting writing<br>public speaking business commentary and<br>extensive international<br>travel first starting out in the banking<br>and tourism sectors he switched to a<br>career in media nearly 20 years ago and<br>has developed a strong reputation as as<br>a business editor and insightful<br>commentator and public speaker<br>he has a strong interest in Global<br>Financial markets International politics<br>social justice issues and helping<br>people Andrew is an ambassador for the<br>lion Foundation young Enterprise program<br>which teaches Business Schools to high<br>school<br>students and is on the selection panel<br>for vone foundation's world of<br>difference project which provides<br>funding scholarships for social justice<br>projects that benefit young<br>people he has pioneered a program that<br>teaches confidence schools to<br>intermediate students in South ockland<br>and provide speech coaching and<br>mentoring for young Mari and Pacifica<br>students welcome Andrew we look forward<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor members of<br>council members of the University Grans<br>families and<br>friends Cur and may I offer my sincere<br>congratulations to those graduating here<br>today I'm honored to be invited to speak<br>to you and it's appropriate that I begin<br>by honoring the memory of my late<br>grandmother who was a very influential<br>educator in my own life in fact in 196<br>at the age of just 16 she was a souch<br>Charged teacher at a small school in the<br>isolated town of Ross south of Greymouth<br>on the west<br>coast imagine that today sending<br>untrained year 11 students to small<br>rural schools and not only expecting<br>them to teach unassisted but to run the<br>school as<br>well in those days you were trial as a<br>teacher before you were sent to training<br>College only the best got through and<br>she was definitely one of the<br>best I read a great line recently about<br>genin y increasingly switching their<br>career Focus From Success to<br>significance it's an important insight<br>to a trend I believe that is rapidly<br>sweeping the world where meaning and<br>purpose are much more highly valued than<br>simply<br>success the most popular at Harvard<br>Business School these days is no longer<br>Finance or Investment Banking it's now<br>social<br>entrepreneurship consumers are<br>increasingly seeking out products that<br>are produced by ethical<br>manufacturers businesses are redefining<br>their role in the Societies in which<br>they operate disruption and Innovation<br>have become the two most important words<br>in the business<br>lexicon right now they should be the two<br>most important words in the education<br>sector as<br>well I want you to think of yourselves<br>as<br>disruptors because my sense is that<br>education in the next decade is about to<br>be disrupted on a scale few people truly<br>appreciate this idea that we process<br>students and batches through an<br>industrial style model is clearly<br>outdated and while we haven't quite<br>worked out what to replace it with I<br>believe we are beginning to get a sense<br>of what that change is going to<br>involve in the time I have available I<br>want to share with you three stories of<br>disruptors I have covered in the course<br>of my work recently who are already<br>making their mark on education both in<br>this country and<br>overseas last year when I was in the<br>United States I had the opportunity to<br>meet with and interview sell khah the<br>founder of KH Academy which many of you<br>will be familiar with this former hedge<br>fund manager earning a multi million<br>salary discovered mid Korea that he was<br>in fact A Gifted teacher today he earns<br>probably a quarter of what he was on<br>previously but here's the thing he told<br>me he has never been happier or more<br>fulfilled in just 3 years he has built<br>the world's largest online school where<br>an estimated 10 million students every<br>month are able to teach themselves a<br>vast array of subjects including maths<br>physics chemistry biology history art<br>history economics and even computer<br>coding and all free of charge as a<br>result of funding provided by The Gates<br>Foundation but as he points out in his<br>book The One World Schoolhouse a book I<br>can highly recommend you read the idea<br>of KH Academy is not to replace the<br>teacher but to support them with a<br>technology platform that is truly<br>outstanding I want to quote from an<br>essay sent to me by a year 13 student on<br>the NorthShore detailing his experience<br>using KH Academy after hearing my<br>interview with cell Khan on my radio<br>live program last year my realization he<br>wrote that things needed to change came<br>at the end of<br>2013 when I was required to take full<br>control of my own<br>learning it was as though the<br>traditional brick and mortar classroom<br>model had failed me after a year of<br>attending classes and doing my homework<br>I was still unable to score a passing<br>Mark in practice<br>exams I decided that drastic action was<br>needed so with just 6 weeks to go until<br>my external exams I turned to K Academy<br>I used the website every day for hours<br>on end in fact truth be told I actually<br>preferred it to my real classroom at<br>school after a few weeks of using K<br>Academy I began to realize that not only<br>did I understand Concepts I never had<br>before but I was also gaining a real<br>passion for the content that I was being<br>taught after 6 weeks I completed my<br>external exams and the results were<br>absolutely amazing across my subjects I<br>scored an a average in just 6 weeks K<br>Academy had taken what a Traditional<br>School would have called a subpass<br>student and turned him into a high<br>achiever today that student is in his<br>first year at this University<br>undertaking a conjoint degree in<br>engineering and commerce an opportunity<br>he would have been denied without the<br>assistance of KH Academy it's a reminder<br>of the importance of Blended learning<br>options that now exist for students to<br>literally take control of their own<br>learning and the changing role of<br>teachers as<br>facilitators my second story is about a<br>remarkable 12-year-old student some of<br>you may have heard of already in fact he<br>featured in the New Zealand Herald just<br>last week I first met Tristan Pang last<br>year when I was a speech coach for a<br>tedex youth event I helped organize what<br>makes Tristan truly exceptional is that<br>despite being just 12 he has already<br>passed Cambridge year 13 maths gaining<br>96% in his final exam in fact this year<br>he's already studying stage one<br>mathematics at this University and next<br>year can you believe it he will be a<br>full-time<br>student prior to speaking of at Ted he<br>was perhaps your typical gifted child<br>who would run a mile from being put on a<br>stage to speak to an audience of 500<br>plus people but with coaching and<br>support I was able to provide for him<br>his awesome Talent has now been truly<br>Unleashed following an approach from his<br>parents to be his mentor I've had the<br>opportunity to work closely with Tristan<br>which I have to say has been quite a<br>remarkable experience last year I<br>organized for him to speak at a desal<br>one school in Glenn inis where he'd been<br>invited to deliver his Ted talk in<br>person the reaction from the more than<br>200 students who attended surprised<br>everyone not only were they in complete<br>a of his achievements but the Applause<br>at the end of his talk went on for some<br>minutes one student even asked me if<br>Tristan would consider becoming his new<br>maths teacher While others told me his<br>talk had inspired them to try harder<br>with their own learning as a result of<br>his visit Tristan told me he wanted to<br>do something to help the school a<br>challenge I encouraged him to pursue he<br>then proceeded to spend his entire<br>Christmas holidays building a website he<br>has called Tristan's Learning Hub with<br>no prior experience working with HTML or<br>coding he simply taught himself how to<br>build the site just as he's been<br>teaching himself Maths for the last 11<br>years he bought all the necessary<br>equipment and now writes and delivers<br>his own math lessons in a series of 5<br>minute videos much like sell Khan but<br>importantly he does differentiate<br>between year levels today Tristan is a<br>confident speaker and an inspiring<br>student who's able to share his talents<br>and gifts with a wide audience just<br>recently he received an email from<br>Professor aan O'Brien in the maths<br>Department praising him for his efforts<br>developing his new website and thanking<br>him for helping him to do his job in an<br>email to me Tristan expressed utter<br>astonishment that he could actually help<br>a professor with his<br>work the other aspect of the story is<br>about celebrating this remarkable new<br>paradigm that now exists where it's<br>possible for an increasing number of<br>gifted and talented students to also be<br>teachers at the same time I know of one<br>year 13 student who's established an<br>after school academy teaching other<br>students how to code I believe this idea<br>of peer-to-peer learning presents a<br>whole new opportunity to reshape the way<br>we look at education where the roles of<br>student and teacher can be much more<br>interchangeable particularly when it<br>comes to it and<br>Technology my final disruptor is Francis<br>Valentine founder of the Mind lab in New<br>Market a facility for four to 14y olds<br>that allows them to explore technology<br>in a way that truly captivates<br>students Francis has converted and<br>converted a warehouse into what I would<br>describe as an Aladdin's cave filled<br>with technology allowing students to<br>develop their skills in robotics web<br>design computer coding app development<br>animation and digital design with highly<br>skilled tutors on hand to assist<br>students can visit the Mind lab either<br>as part of their class or after school<br>turn up there on any day and it's like<br>stepping into a classroom of the future<br>there are plenty of other disruptors I<br>could mention including the likes of<br>book track who have developed worldclass<br>technology right here in New Zealand<br>that allows student readers to hear an<br>audio track of sound effects as they<br>read significantly increasing their<br>engagement levels or Terrence Wallace<br>whose of the endzone project in Epsom a<br>small farow style hostel where 55 maldi<br>and Pacifica boys from lwi income<br>backgrounds now get the opportunity to<br>attend Oakland grammar or Pat sneden<br>who's been instrumental in establishing<br>the manah colani trust which provides<br>every student in one of the poorest<br>parts of Oakland with a digital device<br>of their own that forms an integral part<br>of their<br>learning what each of these disruptors<br>all of whom have come from outside the<br>education profession have success y<br>achieved is taking a piece of the<br>education model and completely<br>reimagining it my challenge to you today<br>is to think how you can follow in their<br>footsteps recently I visited Evendale<br>College to speak to students in their<br>new innovation program get this classes<br>start at 7:30 and I was the last one to<br>arrive students are team classes also on<br>a Saturday morning and they can't get<br>enough of it two years ago I developed a<br>confidence course for the students at<br>Mana intermediate school after becoming<br>aware that this was an issue that was<br>preventing many of the students from<br>being able to achieve their true<br>potential establishing the course<br>allowed me to pass on a range of<br>communication and presentation skills<br>that I had acquired from working in the<br>media time doesn't permit me to tell you<br>the full story about the structure of<br>the course itself but you can watch my<br>recent tedex talk for the backstory but<br>survis to say that I've always been<br>interested in the role of confidence and<br>ambition to unlock potential and the<br>course has certainly proven that to be<br>the case I want to share with you a<br>letter written to me by one 13-year-old<br>student at the end of the first course I<br>ran listen to the power of His words and<br>the liberating tone he<br>conveys Dear Mr Patterson I'm writing to<br>thank you for helping me with my<br>confidence I also want to thank you for<br>taking time out of your hard and busy<br>day to do something to help all of us<br>you're the man<br>bro ultimate compliment I feel like I<br>could talk in front of my class now<br>without having to Panic or freeze I just<br>don't know what to do or say for all<br>your hard work I decided before I came<br>to the course I wouldn't answer any of<br>the questions because I didn't want to<br>be judged for what I said I was nervous<br>once but now I believe what I want to<br>believe you taught me that I especially<br>loved how you changed all the others who<br>were just like me on the course they<br>were all kind of nervous but then bam<br>there they were talking before my eyes<br>with a lot of Pride and self-confidence<br>and I was watching them and I felt I was<br>on the same Journey with them it was<br>just amazing how everyone had improved<br>and learned so much so I'd like to make<br>you a promise when I'm older I will get<br>a great job and buy you a<br>Lamborghini you're sincerely Bailey<br>manga I told Bailey it was probably one<br>of the most sincere thank you letters<br>I'd ever received and if ever a<br>Lamborghini turned up on my doorstep at<br>least I'd know who it was from Bailey<br>announced to his family recently that he<br>now plans to go to university something<br>he had never considered or thought about<br>previously I want to conclude with a few<br>pieces of advice to take with you into<br>your careers as Educators research says<br>that most people only remember one thing<br>from any speech and after 6 weeks even<br>that one thing is usually forgotten your<br>Educators so I want you to remember five<br>the key words to remember are connect<br>innovate exceed success and<br>responsibility or cries if you prefer<br>newonics to assist your Reco<br>firstly connect with the young people<br>that you are working with and stay<br>connected I realize as you progress your<br>careers that will become more of a<br>challenge but the ability to be the<br>person who inspires motivates nurtures<br>and empowers is such a powerful<br>relationship never underestimate the<br>impact that you will have and can<br>continue to have on lives both now and<br>in the future I'm still mentoring<br>students I taught more than TW I I<br>tutored more than 25 years ago be<br>Innovative and disruptive in your<br>approach these days it's no longer about<br>thinking outside the box it's about<br>thinking in whole new<br>boxes thirdly don't help students just<br>achieve their potential as John Hatty<br>pointed out in a lecture he gave at the<br>recent Festival of Education the true<br>measure of your success as educators<br>will be your ability to help students<br>exceed their<br>potential show students what success<br>looks like either bring that ESS into<br>their world or take them to see it bring<br>it to life for them and help pathway<br>help create Pathways that allow them to<br>see their own success in the future<br>finally get students to see themselves<br>as their own teachers and to take<br>responsibility for their own learning<br>that way you help them to help them to<br>learn one of life's most important<br>lessons you only get out of life what<br>you put into it when Holocaust Survivor<br>in renowned psychology academic Victor<br>Frankl who wrote the bestselling book<br>Man's Search for meaning a book I might<br>add everyone should read was once asked<br>to express in a single sentence the<br>meaning of his own his own life he said<br>this the meaning of your life is to help<br>others Find the meaning of theirs that's<br>a challenge we should all embrace<br>thank you Andrew for a most for a<br>fascinating and challenging address<br>thank you very<br>much could you all join with me in<br>thanking Andrew once again for that<br>address<br>this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the University at which<br>the pro-chancellor Peter Kylie and I<br>will be

confirmant of a degree<br>or the award of a diploma in the faculty<br>teaching excellence<br>awards the university places<br>considerable significance on excellence<br>and<br>teaching it recognizes this by making<br>Awards each year to teachers who have<br>demonstrated excellence in aspects of<br>teaching these awards are contestable<br>across the university and signify a<br>truly a superior<br>achievement an award for earlier career<br>excellent excellence and teaching has<br>been made to Dr J<br>Marlo in the school of counseling Human<br>Services and social work within the<br>faculty of<br>Education I call upon a student of that<br>faculty Natasha Ura Baker to read the<br>T since joining the faculty in 2010 Dr J<br>Malo has established a strong track<br>record of collaborative and Innovative<br>teaching<br>practices his lectures are always well<br>prepared relevant to our learning<br>outcomes and he uses teaching methods<br>that keep us focused and<br>engaged Jay frequently encourage student<br>to debate on contested topics related to<br>how we understand our social World<br>whilst carefully allowing us to<br>critically examine and celebrate where<br>our attitudes and beliefs come from Jay<br>provided a place and space to do this in<br>safe and engaging<br>ways most importantly Jay recognizes<br>that student achievement does not occur<br>in a vacuum and is committed to<br>supporting holistic and supportive<br>student learning environment<br>within and Beyond the<br>classroom this is evidenced by his<br>passion to seeing Refugee background<br>students succeed and he has been part of<br>a group that has successfully advocated<br>for Refugee students to be an Equity<br>Group at the<br>University in 2012 we had a particularly<br>special celebration that Jay was<br>instrumental in making happen a social<br>work student in our course had terminal<br>cancer and was given a limited time<br>frame for her<br>illness The Faculty agreed to host a<br>celebration acknowledging the<br>achievements she had made as she was not<br>going to be able to complete her degree<br>at this function Jay facilitated the<br>Gathering and made a heartfelt speech<br>where the school staff recognized her<br>achievements in my view this relates to<br>Simon concept of fa which means a<br>foundation with a solid foundation it is<br>then possible to imagine imagine what<br>might be possible to<br>build the care that Jay demonstrates to<br>students from diverse backgrounds has<br>played an important role in providing<br>such a foundation as I walk across the<br>stage I do so enriched by te Jay's<br>teaching and fellow peers both past and<br>present that provided the solid<br>foundation for me to imagine what might<br>be possible as a future social worker<br>Huda<br>w<br>on behalf of the University I invite all<br>today's graduat to stand and receive the<br>congratulations of us all please be<br>standing<br>and this would be a really good time for<br>the graduates to show their appreciation<br>of their families and supporters and the<br>staff of the University who have helped<br>them as they have achieved their<br>qualifications this concludes this<br>meeting of Council in convocation of the<br>university for the confirmant of degrees<br>and the award of<br>diplomas I now invite you
