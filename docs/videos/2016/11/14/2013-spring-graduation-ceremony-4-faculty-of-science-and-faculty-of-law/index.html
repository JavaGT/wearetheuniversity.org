demolition of the<br>old industrial building is nearly<br>complete with commen construction of the<br>research these buildings represent an<br>investment of 88 million and support our<br>engineering and research in postgraduate<br>teaching for the benefit of all New<br>Zealand we occupy the first of these new<br>facilities in November 2014<br>work has also began on the new science<br>to in the corner well as the ignment<br>stre this major construction project<br>which represents an investment of more<br>than 200 million not only allow us to<br>upgrade Science teaching and research<br>but allows to integrate the School of<br>Psychology and the school of environment<br>into the main science<br>Precinct this will free up the human<br>Sciences building for referment with of<br>the<br>faulty spending on new bu<br>identified in our long-term capital plan<br>will total several hundred million do by<br>the end of the<br>decade the buildings alone do not make

last 12 years demonstrating that<br>both teaching and research Excellence<br>institution The crucial contribution of<br>major research universities such as ours<br>is not well<br>understood our Innovative research is<br>vital for longterm sustainable growth<br>and social cohesion never more so than<br>the testing Economic Times we face in<br>the wake of the global recession and the<br>fast universities equipped graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for careers not yet<br>emerging so as you graduate please<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and to consider a wide<br>range of postgraduate options available<br>for you at a<br>ask you to consider that because we can<br>never rest on our laws especially in<br>World however whatever part you follow I<br>urge you as the alumar of New Zealand's<br>leading University to never forget<br>university we rely on our graduates to<br>support moral political commen funders<br>and strengths are peral

a<br>backpack and a dive book to experience<br>really more Cosmopolitan part of the<br>world that's as long been the way of<br>things in a year ago I made a short<br>visit to the World War I battlefield of<br>Flanders carved in the marble that<br>surrounds the tomp cry is the name of my<br>great great uncle Neils Anderson an<br>infant in New Zealand rle Brigade he was<br>killed in the 5

us is the<br>adventure was something you can try at<br>home it's not just about how backpacks<br>into com banded it can be had and the<br>scientific challenges we accept or in<br>the new businesses we<br>start you the following calls example<br>that<br>technology is growing rapidly and our<br>scientists now routinely compete with<br>the best in the<br>world so let me get you a chance tonight<br>to close the be and wealth with<br>Australia we just need another 100<br>technology businesses now C films can be<br>built on just the type of knoow and the<br>ability to think critically
