reflected<br>in our strategic<br>plan is to continue to invest in a<br>community of accomplished staff and<br>students an important element of that<br>investment is ensuring that our teaching<br>facilities are of the highest<br>quality to this end the council<br>completed in 2013<br>the purchase of the former lion<br>breweries site a new market as the basis<br>for a new campus which will be<br>integrated with the existing City and<br>Grafton<br>campuses at New Market work is well<br>underway on construction of the<br>engineering Research<br>Laboratories these buildings

new<br>year work has also begun on the new<br>science tower on the corner of wellis Le<br>and Simon streets this<br>major of more than $300<br>million it will allow us to upgrade<br>Science teaching and research and<br>integrate the School of Psychology and<br>the school of environment into the main<br>science<br>Precinct this will in turn free up the<br>human science Sciences building for<br>faculty constant Innovation is the<br>Cornerstone of a university such as<br>ours Innovative teaching and research is<br>vital for a long-term sustainable<br>economic growth of our country and<br>social cohesion of our<br>nation this has never been more so than<br>in the testing times we face in the wake<br>of the global recession the Christ<br>Church earthquakes and the yet to be<br>defined effects of global<br>warming universities equipped graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>world so as you graduate today please<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and consider the wide<br>range of post-graduate options available<br>to you at this<br>University reflect on the changes in<br>technology you

this<br>because we can never rest on our Laurels<br>especially in a challenging and<br>everchanging<br>World whatever path you follow as you go<br>out into the world I urge you as the<br>alum I of New Zealand's leading<br>University to never forget your El Alma<br>your<br>University we rely on our graduates for<br>support moral political and<br>Financial Funding constraints are a<br>perennial problem for New Zealand<br>universities who are being asked to do<br>more and more with less and less each<br>year in fact in these times we should be<br>spending more on universities not less<br>but don't worry we will be in touch with<br>you when the time comes and when we do<br>support but that is enough of the<br>substantial issues facing us all as<br>members of a 21st century

thank you Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor members of council members of<br>the university gradu and<br>friends I can feel a lot of pride in<br>this room today not just from here but<br>from up there from mothers and father<br>others who are sharing this moment with<br>you and if such a thing were possible<br>there would doubtless be others from<br>earlier generations of your family who<br>would take great pleasure to see you<br>here today and in that light I have a<br>short little story for you<br>mine my great-grandfather was called<br>Ivan or Ivan he lived in the village of<br>podara on the dalmatian coast of what is<br>now Croatia he was the village black<br>Smith I'm told he was one of the few in<br>the village who could read apparently<br>this bestowed upon him quite a degree of<br>Mana because he could tell the other<br>villagers what was in the local<br>newspaper he also had debts though he<br>had many daughters many weddings and<br>dowes to pay for so a lot fell on the<br>shoulders of his first son he was the<br>ninth child born he was my grandfather<br>shimun shimon's the Croatian way of sang<br>Simon<br>Shimon also learned to read and write<br>and at a young age he helped in his<br>father's blacksmith shop but the debts<br>weren't reducing and Shimon wanted to do<br>what many other Dalmatian youngsters did<br>head overseas find a job and send money<br>back to clear the family debt many had<br>come to New Zealand and that's what<br>Shimon did he took two months to sail<br>here he arrived in December<br>1906 he was 15 he didn't speak any<br>English he followed well-worn Trail the<br>dalmatian Trail up up to Northland to<br>dig for CI gum there was a big trade in<br>it money to be made the work was hard he<br>did try other work he went South to W<br>among other things he dug ditches and he<br>drained swamps he never went to school<br>but he picked up the English language<br>eventually he settled in tomonui and ran<br>a small business there a cafe near the<br>railway station an arranged marriage<br>brought antia from podara to<br>my grandmother they had four children<br>three daughters and a son now in those<br>days males were much favored in the<br>family structure and while all the<br>children went to Primary School only one<br>the son was encouraged to do something<br>no one else in the family had done<br>before and that was to go to university<br>that son was Ivan my father there's a<br>trend here Ivan Simon Ivan Simon and the<br>family probably picked that up he came<br>to this University<br>to study architecture and he had a long<br>career and practiced practically<br>full-time right through into his 80s and<br>some of you may have spent some time<br>working in buildings he designed here at<br>this University the recreation center<br>the Arts and Commerce complex the new<br>University marai the F<br>Pacifica and if you've wondered around<br>teapa our national museum in Wellington<br>You' have walked through a building<br>where he was the lead architect<br>tertiary education opened my father's<br>mind to a world far removed from that of<br>a Village Blacksmith of only two<br>generations<br>before with a very harsh segue I bring<br>myself into this story now my father was<br>a designer and I've been a<br>reporter in September<br>1995 Mount Ru<br>erupted it was a Saturday afternoon and<br>I was on weekend Duty as a reporter here<br>in the Oakland Newsroom at tvnz a<br>cameraman and I were immediately<br>dispatched down to ruu to get to the<br>volcano and get there as soon as<br>possible it was too dark to do much<br>filming by the time we got there that<br>afternoon but we tried we formulated a<br>plan to get up there the next morning we<br>had a helicopter and the seismologists<br>who wanted to go up to the crater well<br>there were too many of them to fit into<br>their one helicopter so we did a deal<br>and we said one of you guys come with us<br>if we can land and film you doing your<br>work on the crater which is what we did<br>so that Sunday morning uh my cameraman<br>and I were standing on the summit it was<br>smothered in Gray Ash like the icing on<br>top of a cake the ash eruptions had<br>stopped overnight there was just White<br>Steam billowing from the crater you<br>couldn't hear anything but the wind<br>whistling in your ears the helicopter<br>pilot landed a few hundred meters away<br>from the crater and he stayed inside his<br>craft<br>now we did some filming for 20 or 30<br>minutes interviewed the seismologists<br>then went back up to the crater to do<br>one last piece of<br>filming and then an ash eruption<br>started my heart leapt I was scared but<br>also excited this is what all television<br>news reporters dreamed of being<br>somewhere exciting when something was<br>happening right in front of<br>you if you could picture the scene if I<br>was standing on Mount ru now and the<br>cameraman was standing right there you<br>know those big cameras with you put them<br>on their shoulder like that and way<br>behind him was the helicopter and maybe<br>70 or 80 M over this way was the<br>crater black ash was slowly rolling over<br>the lip and slowly coming towards us I<br>tried very hard to maintain my composure<br>but probably<br>failed you but you can imagine this is a<br>very exciting moment so I was looking at<br>the cameraman talking about the<br>unpredictability of standing on a<br>volcano and GL glancing over my shoulder<br>at the same time and looking back at the<br>cameraman and glancing over my shoulder<br>and looking back and he was sprinting<br>helicopter I don't recall him saying<br>anything I took off after<br>him I'm not I won't name my cameraman<br>but he did do a very very two very<br>clever things first thing was he didn't<br>turn off his camera and as he ran uh he<br>had the lens pointing behind<br>him leaping and dragging myself through<br>the<br>snow now that is without doubt the most<br>Vivid experience of my television news<br>uh reporting career and for some years<br>the film of that little incident was<br>played in an exhibition about New<br>Zealand's volcanic activity and that<br>exhibition was at T Papa where my father<br>was the lead architect you see I tied<br>this all up eventually it took me a<br>while but I got there so I hope that you<br>uh scale whatever Heights you are aiming<br>for I'm sure achieving a tertiary<br>education and a qualification will help<br>you get there it might even reconnect<br>you with your family in an unexpected<br>way it will almost certainly help you to<br>look at the world with a questioning<br>mind something we can never have enough<br>of and do take a moment to think about<br>what this means for your family they may<br>have made sacrifices to help you along<br>the way parents always wish for a better<br>life for their children so<br>congratulations and may what you do from<br>here be good for you and your family and<br>you thank you<br>Simon for a most interesting and<br>insightful address can you all join with<br>me in thanking Simon again for

Superior<br>achievement an award for sustained<br>Excellence sorry an award for sustained<br>excellence and teaching has been made to<br>Dr Deborah Walker Morrison in the school<br>of European languages and literatures<br>within the faculty of Arts I qualif on a<br>student of that faculty Katherine way to<br>Morrison it is with great pleasure that<br>I am able to speak about the teaching<br>Excellence Dr Deborah Walker Marson<br>exudes having had the privilege of<br>taking two of Deborah's courses French<br>language and culture and film and<br>literature and French Cinema since the<br>new wave I can say with the utmost<br>certainty that Deborah is truly a<br>lecturer in her own<br>League the depth of Deborah's knowledge<br>and passion for what she teaches is<br>formidable it is evident in every course<br>that each film and each text have been<br>meticulously handpicked to reflect a<br>plethora of thought-provoking<br>themes it is impossible to praise de's<br>teaching without mentioning her tendency<br>to<br>shock Deborah never strips works of<br>their originality and provokes in the<br>most beneficial way allthough students<br>to confront often difficult Concepts and<br>issues Debra incorporates the use of<br>videos overheads PowerPoints handouts<br>and pre-recorded lectures in both French<br>and English seamlessly into all<br>courses on a personal level given my<br>often haphazard timetable resulting from<br>law and a double language major in arts<br>a particular facet that helped my<br>learning enormously was Debra's forward<br>thinking the first week of any course<br>usually consists of<br>administration but Debra delves straight<br>into the contents having made all<br>explanatory material straight sorry<br>having made all explanatory material<br>available online for access in our own<br>time it's details like these that make<br>Debra a generously thoughtful lecturer<br>who maximizes the productivity of his<br>students teaching is defined as<br>imparting knowledge to or instructing<br>someone as to how to do<br>something Deborah offers her students<br>the opportunity to take away their own<br>distinct observations by balancing the<br>line between instruction and freedom of<br>thought and<br>stated in English this roughly trans<br>relates to truth is more valuable if it<br>takes you a few years to find<br>it such an approach compels students to<br>produce work that is both insightful and<br>astute it is this ethos that resonates<br>most with me and makes it a real honor<br>to acknowledge Deborah as a worthy<br>recipient of this teaching Excellence<br>award<br>we are now nearing the end of the formal<br>part of this<br>celebration on behalf of the University<br>I invite all today's graduates to stand<br>and receive the congratulations of us<br>all<br>and while you're all standing it would<br>be a really good time for the graduates<br>to show
