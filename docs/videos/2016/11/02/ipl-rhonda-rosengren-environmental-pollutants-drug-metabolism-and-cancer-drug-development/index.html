the<br>unseasonably warm weather we are going<br>to try to keep the doors open um to let<br>a breeze go through but in the event<br>that things get too noisy we will have<br>to um close them on behalf of the<br>University of itago it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome the STA and students<br>who are here with us this evening and as<br>usual it is always my pleasure to<br>welcome members of the general public<br>who often use these ipls um as a way of<br>finding out more about what's going on<br>at the University of itago I would also<br>like to give a special welcome um to<br>some very special guests who are here<br>this evening um to support Rhonda's IPL<br>her partner Bridget is here and<br>Bridget's mother Penny um traveled from<br>Hamilton to be here Rhonda and Bridget's<br>youngest son Flynn is in the audience<br>and Flynn's brother Fletcher um<br>unfortunately could not be here with us<br>this evening because he is working in<br>Hong Kong but I'm sure that he is here<br>with us in spirit I also understand that<br>there are a large number of um other<br>friends of Rhonda who are in the<br>audience this evening and I would like<br>to warmly welcome you to this<br>IPL everyone is here um because we all<br>understand how important this occasion<br>is um this is a time for us to take<br>stock and reflect on what the university<br>is really all about and for me these<br>ipls are always an opportunity to keep<br>me honest um and they make me very proud<br>it's a chance for me to remind myself of<br>the truly wonderful things that um are<br>going on around this University and<br>things that I share with the public are<br>actually<br>true um and that it is simply the fact<br>that um the extraordinary is part of<br>everyday life here at the University of<br>atago now we are here to support Ronda<br>rosan in her um inaugural Pro<br>professorial lecture and it's important<br>to remind the audience that in order to<br>achieve promotion to Professor here at<br>the University of atago an individual<br>must excel in research and teaching and<br>in service to the university and The<br>Wider academic Community now Professor<br>rosengren has certainly done all three<br>she is a highly gifted teacher who has<br>dedicated a considerable amount of time<br>and effort to both innovation in her own<br>teaching and curriculum development more<br>widely she has also been highly<br>committed to our Hands-On science<br>program and other forms of science<br>Outreach she is also an outstanding<br>researcher her pioneering work on cancer<br>therapeutic drugs is internationally<br>recognized and it's extremely important<br>she is a popular research supervisor and<br>and her students have enjoyed a high<br>level of<br>success and finally her service has been<br>exemplary she currently serves as the<br>head of the Department of pharmacology<br>and toxicology and she regularly<br>contributes to our leadership<br>development program she serves on the<br>editorial Boards of seven journals in<br>her field and most frequently she was<br>not afraid to front the sensitive but<br>extremely important issue of animal<br>research in the media<br>Rhonda on behalf of the University of<br>itago I would like to congratulate you<br>on your well-deserved promotion to<br>professor and I will now call on<br>Professor Vernon Ward the dean of the<br>atago school of medical Sciences to tell<br>us just a little bit more about Rhonda's<br>you welcome everybody thank you for<br>coming along this evening it's my<br>pleasure to give a little bit of<br>background for Ronda so thank you very<br>much for coming along thank you Vice<br>Chancellor for the introduction it was<br>very good thank you it's good to see you<br>all here so that we can celebrate<br>ronda's um leing the title of Professor<br>within the university World reserved now<br>I asked Ronda about a few points of her<br>background that I could use to introduce<br>her today and it was relatively<br>interesting I I got a response it was a<br>relatively let's say tentative response<br>from Rhonda I'd have to say and I came<br>to the conclusion that Rhonda's become a<br>bit kiwi eyes you know that little bit<br>of being scared to that that um tall<br>poppy component to it and I guess that's<br>getting away what's probably not a<br>secret to you and that Ronda speaks with<br>an American accent so she has come from<br>somewhere a field and what she's uh come<br>from is she got her degree in at the<br>Texas A&amp;M University which is why she's<br>enjoying being in a nice Woolen um gown<br>this<br>evening the after taking a degree at<br>Texas A&amp;M University she got um a<br>prestigious post doctoral Fellowship<br>from nihs in the states um when she went<br>and worked at the University of Arizona<br>she followed that up by going to a<br>private university in Florida the um<br>Nova Southeastern University where she<br>was learned a lot around her teaching<br>schools and what have you and took up a<br>faculty post there which I think you'll<br>see her talk about a little bit and I<br>think sort of in some respects I think<br>influenced quite a bit of the strength<br>she shows in<br>teaching she then saw the light and got<br>appointed as a lecturer here in um ataga<br>I say the light you know carefully when<br>I'm in Denon the she went to the<br>Department of pharmacology in<br>1997 she then progressed and has come<br>all the way through the rank she took up<br>as was mentioned previously the head of<br>Department in<br>2010 and has and I'm delighted to say<br>that this year we've reappointed her as<br>another term as the head of Department<br>which tells you how good a job she is<br>doing in that role I did a few adding up<br>of of numbers along the way um just to<br>give you a feeling um for some of the<br>stuff that ronda's done 46 research<br>grants that are either hers or she's<br>named on if you start thinking about how<br>hard it is to get research grants the<br>amount of effort that goes into getting<br>all those research grants then that's<br>quite a substantial achievement it takes<br>a huge amount of effort it also points<br>out how much he collaborates and works<br>with others and that's really important<br>in the field of biomedical<br>research she has UH 60 fully refereed<br>articles the vast vast majority of which<br>are Journal articles and some very good<br>journals as well she's been as was<br>mentioned on um editorial B Board of<br>journals she's also refereed papers on a<br>further 20 journals so is broadly<br>broadly read and she has 32 postgraduate<br>completions and those students many of<br>which have wored prizes and Awards as<br>they've gone through their<br>degree it's already been mentioned that<br>she's a ex excellent teacher and she is<br>I get to see her student survey forms<br>they are very very good there are very<br>few that would stand up to that scrutiny<br>they excellent not only does she teach<br>particularly well but she's into<br>education so she's published in the<br>education literature on the work she<br>does so it's not just she actually<br>practices what she preaches and I think<br>many of us could take some lessons from<br>that so I think of us the summarize up<br>here and let Ronda come and speak now<br>the Ronda does as<br>what all good academics do she does it<br>all she teaches extremely well she leads<br>in the teaching she does her research<br>very well she leads in her research and<br>she leads in the service components that<br>she does and that's what we expect of<br>our professors so I'd like to on that<br>note invite Professor Rosen grren come<br>and present her talk and I'm not going<br>to steal the Thunder of her talk but I<br>believe it will you will see as from the<br>title there a nice broad breadth of<br>research in her discipline so I'll close<br>wow thank you very much for coming um<br>I'm really humbled to be here it's uh<br>it's a huge honor um however probably<br>Vernon probably stole the Thunder a<br>little bit I can't help but quote<br>Groucho marks who's been known to say<br>I'm not sure I want to be a part of any<br>club who'd have someone like me as a<br>member um so that's kind of how I really<br>feel but I'm part of the club I suppose<br>and so you've come here it's hot and so<br>we need to make the most of it so you<br>probably want to maybe find out how I<br>got here so some people might say you're<br>a product of your environment and I've<br>lived in some harsh climate so some<br>people might find me cold other people<br>might find me a bit prickly um but what<br>about my Jean Pool from from my mother I<br>learned hold on to your slippers because<br>tragedy can Spike at any moment from my<br>father I learned don't talk about it<br>work very hard but never take yourself<br>too seriously this was reinforced by my<br>grandmother who um had those same traits<br>and between her her and my father they<br>both taught me to swear which I did with<br>a Vengeance and I hope I won't do<br>tonight but I do make no promises um and<br>also to um I love baseball which I<br>and also to take any competition no<br>matter how silly very seriously so if<br>there's a trophy on the line then you<br>better do it do your all from my sister<br>I learned to be a long time before I<br>ever measured up from my four-legged<br>older brother I learned life is always<br>better when a with with the dog around<br>so somehow this weird hodge podge um<br>upbringing got me doing a lot of sports<br>and when you're grow when you grow up to<br>be competitive then there's all kinds of<br>you can be competitive about and when<br>you're an American and I apologize for<br>the American accent you can't help but<br>getting uh get um ridiculed for going to<br>band camp and yes I went to band camp<br>but you go to band camp because you are<br>going to do competitions in band and<br>which you did that too so I did that<br>kind of thing so somehow this sort of<br>Hodge pody thing I think prepared me for<br>University maybe and so I packed my bags<br>and went off to University and um I'm<br>going to try to go fast although I will<br>point out you can tell that I don't<br>really have the grades it doesn't look<br>like I'm going to go to grad school<br>these aren't really your grad school<br>kind of grades um so essentially I don't<br>want to make an excuse for this I'm<br>going to say my money ran out and when I<br>had those grades I was also working a<br>full-time job and taking a full load um<br>good excuse but anyway you might think<br>the university kicked me out but they<br>didn't kick me out but I did drop out<br>because I ran out of money and I had a<br>year working Minal jobs and then went<br>back to undergraduate and again you'd<br>think well you know us at aago we want<br>our senior students to be doing well<br>well you can see I didn't do so well my<br>very last semester but that a that Lan a<br>sitting there was in a research class<br>that I took and um that got me meeting<br>the most amazing person on the planet<br>and his name is Steve safe and so I did<br>an undergraduate research project in his<br>lab and everything really clicked and I<br>thought this is it this is what I really<br>love this is what I want to do so I<br>thought okay I should get a master's<br>degree and I apply for my masters and as<br>you're thinking I mean you're not get a<br>master's degree and Steve said well you<br>didn't get in for Masters but this is<br>because your grades are crap didn't you<br>notice and two I don't take Master<br>students so he said if you want to work<br>with me you're gonna have to do a PhD<br>and so I went well okay that's fine I'll<br>do that so um and I think part of the<br>other reason I'm going to divert here<br>for a minute but I think part of the<br>reason why I feel the need to quote<br>Groucho marks is most people probably<br>think they have a really good supervisor<br>at least I hope you've all had good<br>supervisors and everybody is a good<br>supervisor<br>but Steve is a genius and a great guy<br>and off the chart and so for those who<br>understand this language he has an H<br>index of 105 so you can see why I don't<br>think I belong in this club because when<br>you're trained by that kind of person<br>the yard stick is always Way Beyond<br>anything you're ever going to achieve<br>okay so one little thing because I do<br>Sports a lot this also shows you how old<br>I am I just put these in here because<br>triathlons as a sport started when I was<br>an undergraduate<br>so um also too so just to just so you<br>know that maybe I should be here when I<br>went to grad school things came right so<br>you know sometimes so it was a late<br>bloom or whatever it is so anyway let's<br>talk about my PhD work um so before you<br>can do that just want to introduce you a<br>little bit to the subject which is um<br>environmental pollutants and dioxin so<br>dioxin is sort of like the media word<br>for this class of compounds so um dioxin<br>is technically called 2378 tetrachloro<br>dibenzo parod dioxin and it's the most<br>potent in that class of compounds but it<br>belongs to a class of dioxins so<br>basically if you move chlorines around<br>here you get other versions of these<br>compounds and they their potency is<br>related to where those chlorines are so<br>why do we care or why is it in the<br>environment well when it's an<br>environmental contaminant so when<br>companies make herbicides such as 2 four<br>five TR chlorophenoxy atic acid then you<br>are um which is a herbicide whenever the<br>companies make that they make dioxin is<br>a contaminant okay so and then in the<br>Vietnam War the US took a 50-50 mixture<br>of those two chemicals and called it<br>agent orange and put it in Vietnam as a<br>jungle defoliant because they're great<br>herbicides now in New Zealand things for<br>you guys to know you think you're lean<br>and green and wonderful and kind of are<br>but up in tanaki was um the Dow plant<br>there was the last place in the world to<br>manufacture these phoxy herbicides so<br>New Zealand still has a dioxin<br>contaminant issue in this country so<br>it's a highly toxic compound it causes<br>birth defects cancer wasting syndrome<br>Chlor acne and you might you know a wide<br>audience I'm going to try to say things<br>so everybody can understand but this you<br>might know the Russian president Yenko<br>you might have remembered in the news so<br>this was him before he get he got<br>deliberately Poisoned With dioxin and<br>then he's you know come right so this is<br>a chloracne is really horrible and um so<br>you can see him getting that Chlor acne<br>and then kind of resolving itself over<br>the years<br>so dioxin is Toxic by binding to this<br>protein called Aero hydrocarbon<br>receptor and that's how it elicits all<br>of its nasty stuff and when you um a<br>Hallmark response for any kind of living<br>animal to being exposed to dioxin is you<br>make more enzyme in your liver called<br>cytochrome p451 A1 and that's just<br>something you can do I call it's a<br>biomarker so say you want to um examine<br>whether or not there's been oh here's a<br>good one in Antarctica one would hope<br>there aren't pollutants so if you study<br>penguins and you find sip 1 A1 in the<br>liver of penguins they've been exposed<br>to these types of compounds okay so it's<br>a biomarker anyway so here's the my<br>paper from my PhD and now don't get<br>worried you lay people I'm not going to<br>walk you all through this there's only<br>going to be two take-home messag me but<br>my first message is I've been accused of<br>having a love of numbers and this might<br>be why because this is how I was<br>immersed in numbers when I'm 20 so I'm<br>sorry if I like numbers I was probably<br>so anyway all I want you to see my my<br>project as a PhD student was what<br>happens when we move these chlorines<br>around how does that change the potency<br>of the compounds and one of the ways<br>that you figure that out this protein's<br>got to bind onto its receptor and the<br>tighter it binds the worse the toxicity<br>is so back in the day the old way to do<br>this this is the old version and so in<br>green there you don't even have to look<br>at the numbers all you have to do is<br>look at it's a nanomolar value so we<br>took in all kinds of things like<br>thermodynamic parameters which I won't<br>bore you with these are the<br>thermodynamics so we did all these other<br>things and then we did computer modeling<br>and then now these are the new model<br>numbers that we have and the only thing<br>you lay people need to look about is at<br>the top this is pamar and maybe that's<br>even you don't like those those words<br>either but basically these are smaller<br>numbers the smaller the number the<br>tighter The Binding the more toxic the<br>compound and so this was sort of an<br>instrumental thing at the time for<br>trying to figure out realized too this<br>is ages ago um so it was kind of key for<br>figuring out structure activity this is<br>going to be a theme through the talk<br>tonight I think structure activity so<br>structure activity with these okay so<br>dioxins toxic and horrible summary<br>number one the other thing is on the<br>other side of it which is kind of weird<br>is it also protects against breast<br>cancer but through a whole new novel<br>mechanism okay so in a way just kind of<br>when you meet a nasty person you don't<br>really want to pigeon hole them they<br>might have a good side and so dacin has<br>this little it's not a good side for<br>doxin but it's a good side for research<br>because if you know the mechanism now we<br>can find new compounds that can exploit<br>that mechanism that's what Steve did and<br>he synthesized a bunch of compounds so<br>another part of my PhD work was working<br>on this compound<br>mcbf which was one of his first novel<br>breast cancer drugs and so it's not<br>toxic it doesn't induce sip 1 A1 it<br>doesn't cause Chlor acne but it protects<br>against breast cancer now when I've got<br>a diverse audience and I'm talking about<br>the age receptor I also like to just<br>tell you things about your food so the<br>other kind of bizarre thing is broccoli<br>and other cruciferous vegetables also<br>contain compounds that bind onto the<br>Aero hydrocarbon receptor and even<br>though your kids might say I don't want<br>to eat broccoli I'm sure they don't say<br>I don't want to eat broccoli it's going<br>to give me chloracne you know these<br>aren't toxic but so and so they've got<br>two really good things to remember about<br>them they've got breast cancer<br>protecting chemicals in them and if<br>you're worried about dioxin<br>contamination they also block the<br>toxicity of dioxin so anytime I'm around<br>General people walking down Den needen<br>streets I usually tell people eat these<br>yeah okay so I moved on to my postdoc<br>and in a way I call my postdoc the<br>tailor two post STS it was the best of<br>times in some ways and in some ways it<br>was the worst of times um so as Vernon<br>said I got on the first try a National<br>Institute Environmental Health Sciences<br>Grant which was fantastic for a a new<br>postdoc I learned heaps about drug<br>interactions and um liver injury and all<br>kinds of stuff but in some way and and<br>you know because I love the outdoors I<br>did all kinds of beautiful outdoor<br>things I started ultramarathon cycling<br>so the desert's a great place to live<br>but as a scientist we all know and these<br>guys know very well that if you don't<br>publish you're dead in the water and I<br>unfortunately had a mentor who wasn't<br>interested in<br>publishing and I started panicking and<br>so I took a job um at a teaching um<br>School in South Florida and if that was<br>The Tale of Two Cities this was<br>definitely Decline and fall because I<br>was definitely stuck um with no research<br>opportunities so um let's focus on the<br>positive the positive of that was I got<br>to to three years teach a diverse group<br>of students you know so I had one of the<br>things I thought made gave me a leg up I<br>don't think anybody in my department<br>thought gave me a leg up when I arrived<br>to too as a lecturer was I'd already had<br>three years of teaching experience under<br>my belt um so I wasn't really daunted by<br>teaching um but I did come close I I I<br>bought some books started thinking about<br>opening up a bike store because I didn't<br>think I was going to get out of there um<br>but I got out obviously because I'm here<br>and I owe a debt of gratit to to dick<br>lavy dick is the one who hired me and<br>even when when he hired me he retired<br>six months later so I didn't really get<br>a chance to work with him for very long<br>but I think I've always sort of thought<br>of dick as he probably doesn't know this<br>but uh as my sort of savior because he<br>brought me to a too and that was great<br>so let's get to you know we're in New<br>Zealand everybody cares about what's<br>local so obviously I was in a big hole<br>how am I going to get out of a hole so<br>if I have a recipe for you how to get<br>out of a hole two major ingredients<br>a group of keen and eager Master<br>students who have the same philosophy<br>you have which is work hard play hard<br>and then just a smattering of funding<br>nothing major just a little sprinkle in<br>a little grant money and sprinkle in<br>heaps of students and write some papers<br>so the other thing about this talk I<br>don't have time to tell you about many<br>of the studies so I'm just going to pick<br>a few key ones we're not going to talk<br>any about any of these so I'm sorry and<br>a lot of these students are here which<br>is fantastic so um I won't ask you to<br>stand up but you can talk to them after<br>the talk um so but I'm going to tell you<br>about probably three key studies from<br>the master's era and so the first one we<br>need to get everybody on the same page<br>so I want to it's going to be about<br>paracetamol so I want to tell you what<br>happens when you take your paracetamol<br>tablets you take your<br>paracetamol and in your liver various<br>reactions are going to happen so the<br>first well not necessarily the first but<br>a major one is going to be something<br>called glucuronidation and<br>glucuronidation takes that paracetamol<br>and makes it big and bulky so you can<br>excrete it another option in your liver<br>are these cytochrome p450s that I was<br>talking about and so these also<br>metabolize paracetamol and they turn<br>that into this compound called napu and<br>then also in your liver is glutathione<br>and glutathione will conjugate and<br>safely excrete that nap cream now it's<br>all a balance normally if you just take<br>a a dose of paracetamol you're fine<br>these pathways are going to go but if<br>you take too much or you shift the<br>pathways this nap Crea is also toxic and<br>so this is what starts giving you liver<br>damage so this is your background of<br>what you need to know to understand my<br>next um project I want to tell you about<br>so we I was working with um retinol<br>because back in the day there were these<br>fad diets of Super Vitamin a fight<br>cancer so these whole studies revolved<br>around the fact of what if someone takes<br>High doese retinol but then they're<br>going to get exposed to all kinds of<br>other compounds okay so that's what this<br>was about so in this cas case the person<br>this is this is a mouse study so they<br>this is a marker for um liver injury you<br>get it out of the plasma um so basically<br>so if you go to the doctor you need a<br>liver function test that's what they're<br>doing they just take that out of your<br>plasma so here's the liver normal amount<br>of liver injury and then how is it<br>highly increased by having this dose of<br>retinol first and so why is this<br>happening was the focus of this of the<br>study and now you know about about the<br>math about the pathway so you know what<br>we're going to look at so and nutshell<br>here's our three cytochrome p450 enzymes<br>and just to get the you know there's<br>nothing interesting here really so<br>that's great see because basically<br>everything looks the same so that means<br>retinol didn't do anything to those<br>enzymes so it's not the cytochrome p450s<br>they're not at<br>fault but that glucuronide here's your<br>normal levels of glucuronide here's how<br>they get dramatically decreased after<br>retinol and they stay down so what this<br>really means is when you have that high<br>do retinol you can't metab you use up<br>all the glucuronide and it's not around<br>to work on the paracetamol now also we<br>were on the cover of this journal in<br>this little graph it doesn't matter you<br>don't really need to see it or I would<br>have brown it up but that basically<br>shows that that other last pathway<br>glutathione isn't involved so let's just<br>see this really quickly I feel like I'm<br>teaching my third years or second years<br>but basically what this means is when<br>you have retinol in the system this is<br>all going to go away so we've lost that<br>metabolic pathway so that means we're<br>going to shunt everything down towards<br>napu and glutathion is going to get<br>saturated and then you're going to get<br>way more liver injury now so the only<br>other reason one of the main reasons why<br>I decided to pick this as a topic to<br>talk about is just again when I have a<br>generic<br>audience what other ways can your body<br>um change these enzymes so if you are a<br>St uh chronic<br>Drinker you will induce and make lots of<br>the Sip 2V1 enzyme if you smoke you make<br>lots of zip 1A so in the US every P<br>every paracetamol containing product<br>will say if you drink three drinks a day<br>or more than 21 a week do not take this<br>product and we don't do that in New<br>Zealand so I just want you to be well<br>armed that if you drink ethanol<br>chronically you are increasing your<br>chance of getting liver injury when you<br>take panad all that's all so sorry<br>that's you know take home point if you<br>came from nothing else there you go you<br>know you might get one more for<br>free okay now this is another<br>interesting little study that I wanted<br>to talk about um partly again when<br>you're a new lecturer this one came out<br>um Dave mes rung me up at six o'clock on<br>a Friday night so that shows you how<br>exciting my life was then and he says um<br>I hear you know something about cocron<br>p450s and you might um be able to do<br>some essays and I said yeah absolutely<br>um we can do that he said have you heard<br>about St John's wart I said yeah<br>absolutely I have so what was happening<br>St John's wart and this is early 2000s<br>1999 but back in those days a lot of<br>people were taking St John's<br>wart as a a<br>plant anti-depressant because plants are<br>safer okay and so we don't want nasty<br>proac that's a drug I want a plant and<br>so what was happening with me no sorry I<br>shouldn't do that because no offense<br>people don't know okay so sorry I just<br>realized I should leave the room I feel<br>I feel like I'm being a bit arrogant um<br>and that's just not right is<br>it<br>um sorry you can you can we can bring<br>the American here for 18 years and<br>eventually it's going to come out isn't<br>it okay this is serious okay sorry this<br>is serious because so here's a graph<br>from the Lancet and this is how I was<br>knowing about this is there was<br>anecdotal evidence of people having drug<br>interactions after taking St John's work<br>so getting pregnant losing a heart<br>transplant doing various things so this<br>is the example of someone who's had a<br>transplant and you need cyclosporin when<br>you have an organ transplant and so<br>cyclosporin keeps you from rejecting<br>your organ and so here's the plasma<br>levels of the<br>cyclosporin and this person then starts<br>taking St John's wart three times a day<br>and this is for about a month and so so<br>these are the plasma levels sorry i r<br>but and then see how they marketly drop<br>so this is the and then this person<br>recovered and they were all right but<br>other people lost their organs because<br>of this D me mega drop in their<br>cyclosporin levels so this was a again<br>anecdotal Evans there's no proof that<br>this was through cytochrome P 453a but<br>what was it you know so that's where<br>Dave mkey said to me well let's try to<br>figure this out and he got Nigel Perry<br>on board and Nigel's over there and so<br>because Nigel as you know at aago is the<br>plant extract expert so we all work<br>together and essentially we showed that<br>here is the catalytic activ so this is<br>how active your enzyme is and we showed<br>that after 3 weeks of chronically taking<br>the St John's work you do increase the<br>activity of the enzyme and then also<br>there's the how well the enzyme works<br>and how much is there around and we also<br>see that we hugely dramatically increase<br>the amount of sip 3A and sip 3A is the<br>most abundant Le um sip in your liver so<br>when you increase it hugely you really<br>do increase it a lot so this was sort of<br>the we were one of the first people who<br>kind of really prove that this is how<br>this drug interaction is happening and<br>that way people can be warned when<br>they're on various drugs that are<br>metabolized by 3A if you're on St John's<br>work you need to so again maybe free tip<br>number two if you're taking herbal<br>medications or herbal offthe counter<br>things tell your physician when they say<br>are you taking anything don't say no say<br>yes I take whatever it<br>is okay so this is the last study from<br>that Bon era and this one is um again<br>you'll see sort of a pattern we we<br>respond to things we see in the<br>literature so this one was at West<br>Virginia there was a Miller's group and<br>he was reporting that paracetomol was a<br>xenoestrogen so basically this means he<br>was reporting that paracetamol would<br>increase your risk for breast cancer and<br>make breast cancer cells grow and it<br>seemed kind of strange to me that that<br>could be true but you never know things<br>can be true so but we I had a really<br>hardworking Master student at the time<br>who is ready to take on this project and<br>so um we thought well if we're going to<br>answer this question we need to do it<br>thoroughly so first off before I do that<br>let me just show you why I didn't think<br>it was um that logical and put you on<br>the same page so estrogen binds onto an<br>estrogen receptor and so here's and<br>estrogen is also called estrad so<br>there's your your your endogenous<br>hormone and it's going to bind onto its<br>estrogen receptor and then elicit its<br>effects so it does this whole long<br>Cascade of effects let's not worry about<br>what all those<br>are and then the key features of<br>estrogen working are hydroxy groups so<br>here's the hydroxy groups and they're<br>about 11 angstroms apart and that helps<br>it bind Into The ligan Binding pocket in<br>the estrogen receptor now I think most<br>people know this but if you want a plant<br>you know if you're a menopausal woman<br>and you want an estrogen Source a nice<br>safe way to get that is from soy and<br>tofu and so these are phytoestrogens and<br>so you can kind of see genestin is the<br>main ingredient in the soy and again you<br>can kind of see I hope you don't even<br>really need that much chemistry no<br>offense L but you know that these kind<br>of fit in the same shape and could kind<br>of do the rough thing so it makes sense<br>that genestin is a phytoestrogen now two<br>known xenoestrogens or foreign estrogens<br>are bisphenol a which again I kind of my<br>bad if I drawn it on its side it would<br>look more likely but again it's got the<br>the A- ring on the phenol and it has the<br>hydroxy groups in the right spot and so<br>this phenol a is what leeches out of<br>plastics and and has an estrogenic<br>effect okay so that's a foreign estrogen<br>and then diester all I don't know<br>sometimes as toxicologists we know all<br>the weird things and we think everybody<br>else knows but dios testerol was a drug<br>given to women to prevent miscarriage<br>and this is kind of a weird one but it<br>ended up that their off female Offspring<br>as adults got vaginal cancer okay so<br>best chanc know she knows everything um<br>so so you've got so these so ah so it<br>kind of makes sense that these you know<br>these are the known estrogens and now<br>I've shown you the structure before but<br>look at the structure parasal it doesn't<br>really look like the other ones how is<br>that going to fit into the binding<br>pocket but you as a scientist you have<br>to be open maybe it will so we did a<br>comprehensive invitro test and then<br>invivo test so when we did The Binding I<br>won't show you the binding studies it<br>doesn't it did didn't bind but then so<br>then kind of the piece to resist da is<br>to kind of look at animals and so you<br>need to see what's going to happen in an<br>animal can I get an estrogenic effect<br>okay so to walk through this classic<br>effects in an animal from being exposed<br>to estrogen is an increasing the uterine<br>weight so here you see these are just<br>saying these are the control levels and<br>then notice how estrogen brings that way<br>up that's that's the estrogenic effect<br>and here's our three different doses of<br>parasol and they don't change it from<br>control so they're not being that's not<br>acting like an estrogen and another way<br>you can look at it because you never<br>want to look at one parameter so we also<br>can look at uterine peroxidase which is<br>an enzyme in in the uterus and that<br>should go up as well and so here you go<br>there's the control there's another<br>control there's your acetam minin sorry<br>acetominophen in America is paracetamol<br>so don't get confused by that um and we<br>because we published in the American<br>Journal so we got to use American<br>language um and so brings it up and then<br>if anything the acetaminophen is<br>blocking the estrogen's effect and<br>that's kind of the title of the article<br>which is it's not estrogenic it's<br>actually anti-estrogenic and to add one<br>more piece to that to that puzzle<br>another Hallmark response in your body<br>is when you make when you have a lot of<br>estrogen your body says we've got a lot<br>of estrogen we better make more<br>progesterone receptor and you upregulate<br>the progesterone receptor so in this<br>case you can see that estrogen<br>upregulates the progesterone receptor<br>paracetamol is doing nothing and then<br>again the parasol can block the uppr<br>regulation so one of the reasons why I<br>decided to talk about this<br>study is because this is one of the ones<br>even though this was ages ago I was<br>quite proud of this one because once we<br>published this study no one ever<br>published any papers saying that<br>paracetamol was an estrogen so we kind<br>of stopped the controversy which was um<br>kind of nice to<br>do okay so now this might be why a lot<br>of you are here but people really want<br>to know about breast cancer so um we're<br>going to switch and kind of do more<br>recently stuff um so just again to get<br>everybody on the same page um current<br>treatment strategies for breast cancer<br>so breast cancer can be estrogen<br>receptor positive um and when there is<br>an estrogen receptor estrogen does as we<br>talked before binds onto the receptor<br>and causes the breast cancer cells to<br>grow so you can treat that with<br>something that blocks that estrogen<br>receptor which is called a selective<br>estrogen receptor modulator and two<br>major ones are tamoxifen and roox ofine<br>you can also Target the body's ability<br>to make estrogen so it doesn't really<br>matter if you block it from the receptor<br>or keep it from being made basically<br>you're keeping estrogen from doing its<br>job and so you're not going to get the<br>stimulated growth now if you have a<br>cancer that doesn't have the estrogen<br>receptor but has the human isopor for<br>the human the herto isopor or the<br>epidermal growth factor receptor then<br>you can use her septin which is an<br>antibody and targets that okay so these<br>are your standard treatments but then<br>there are also about 70% of 177% of<br>breast cancers are triple negative which<br>mean they don't have those two Targets<br>and they don't have a progesterone<br>receptor and this slide shows you all<br>the drugs that are available which shows<br>you why we decided to work on it because<br>when there are no drugs then this is a<br>topic that is worth studying so one of<br>our first pieces of work that we did in<br>this field is we took a compound<br>egcg is epig galloa and galate it's<br>found in green tea it's a major active<br>constituent in green tea and we put it<br>with<br>tamoxifen in and so you'll see this<br>these kind of string of numbers and<br>letters come up quite a bit this means<br>it's a a cell line of triple negative<br>bre cancer cells so basically this is a<br>cell culture experiment where you put<br>the tamoxifen in it doesn't really do<br>much and if you compare here's our<br>higher dose here's egcg doing a little<br>bit but if we basically put this and<br>that together and we got this so so the<br>two combination this is better than an<br>additive effect this is a synergistic<br>effect and we kill off about more than<br>80% of the cells by those two drugs in<br>combination<br>so after we found that out we published<br>these papers with um PhD students and<br>again I just need to take a minute and<br>say I apologize for not naming everybody<br>but basically you're just going to see<br>pictures of all the hardworking people<br>um but so and I'm not going to tell you<br>about any of this work unfortunately<br>well all I'm going to do is summon up in<br>one slide to make it easy so basically<br>all those students PhD students beavered<br>away and in a way sorry because most of<br>them are in the audience as well and I'm<br>going to summarize all your hard work in<br>like two lines um but basically we<br>looked at tamoxifen and egcg and relox<br>ofine and egcg in<br>combination and um we saw that we could<br>always kill triple negative breast<br>cancer cells and we killed we did that<br>by increasing apoptosis which is just a<br>controlled way of toing cells to die we<br>also told that they the drugs also told<br>the cells well let's just stay in the G1<br>phase and not divide so you get G1<br>arrest and we also disrupted cell<br>signaling through the epidermal growth<br>Factory receptor early on I had this<br>theory that there would be active<br>metabolites of egcg I won't explain to<br>why I had that theory it doesn't matter<br>because I was wrong so we also showed in<br>those papers that it wasn't active<br>metabolites it was clearly coming from<br>the compound so what I do want to show<br>you is what did we see because that's<br>all in vitro and in vitro is great but<br>you need to see that you can change<br>tumor growth in an animal so here's that<br>um here's a definitive study you're<br>going to see a lot of graphs that look<br>like this from here on out so let's just<br>walk you through this one and then I<br>don't have to walk you so much the next<br>times so basically in this case we take<br>a mouse and we implant that Mouse with<br>human breast cancer cells so you've got<br>the human cells growing in the mouse and<br>then you can treat the mouse the way you<br>would treat a human and um so in this<br>case the mice were treated every day<br>orally for 10 weeks and we just follow<br>the tumor growth in those mice and you<br>can see that toxin didn't do much the<br>com the green tea compound is a little<br>bit when we put them together we've<br>almost flatlined that tumor growth okay<br>so these are the kind of tumor curves<br>you look for in a xenograph model so<br>this is a pretty nice outcome and so but<br>and then it's nice to show tumor<br>suppression but why what's happening in<br>those tumors so um this is the signaling<br>through the epidermal growth factor<br>receptor and it's um simplified a bit so<br>the the high-end people will go well<br>that's not really what it looks like but<br>it's it's close enough to make this<br>brief and so basically you can see the<br>checked bars here this is the<br>combination treatment so we affect the<br>epidermal growth factor receptor when<br>the other treatments don't we affect akt<br>we affect nfca B so this is akt and nfca<br>B here and they're proteins that drive<br>cell proliferation so if we can wipe<br>those out then the cells don't grow okay<br>so that's one and then another thing<br>that was happening is this is mour is M<br>milon Target of rapamycin and you can<br>Target this and again here you can see<br>that the individual treatments aren't<br>doing anything here but here we get<br>about a 78% decrease in mtor and mtor is<br>important for cell translation and so<br>this and then also not only mtor but<br>these Downstream effectors from<br>mtor and then lastly um there's a<br>cytochrome p450 enzyme again that sort<br>of drives<br>um drug resistance and also is linked to<br>um when you have high levels women who<br>have high levels of sip 1b1 usually have<br>an aggressive cancer and we were able to<br>show that yes this is decreased<br>dramatically by the combination<br>treatment okay so this was one of our<br>first um Major Works where we were kind<br>of figuring out mechanisms and how to<br>alter tumor growth and so another study<br>around this time was one where we put<br>egcg the green tea compound in in<br>combination with a curcumin with<br>curcumin and curcumin is the major<br>ingredient in the spice Turmeric okay so<br>this is a very similar experiment the<br>only thing that I kind of want to show<br>you is this is again some kind of like<br>that first slide I showed you where we<br>get this synergistic cytotoxicity but<br>the difference here is this is the<br>triple negative breast cancer cell line<br>this is the kind that has the estrogen<br>receptor so this is just basically<br>saying this is specific for triple<br>negative it's not so great when you have<br>the estrogen receptor but this and this<br>is a similar graph that shows you that<br>yes the combination therapy decreases<br>the tumors from growing and is quite<br>effective and then what's happening in<br>those tumors and then this is just<br>showing you that again egfr akt and in<br>this case vascular endothelial growth<br>factor is down and Vascular endothelial<br>growth factor controls um<br>angiogenesis okay<br>so we learned a lot during during that<br>time about mechanisms in tumors and<br>structure activity and so and a lot of<br>people at that time too were also<br>working with these natural compounds and<br>nothing against Natural compounds but<br>the downfall of the phyto chemicals is<br>you need to take boatloads and you still<br>don't get much in the plasma okay so<br>they're not that stable they that<br>boatloads not getting to the plasma for<br>the scientist is called Low<br>bioavailability<br>um and so then you need really large<br>quantities okay and so when they do<br>phase one clinical trials in people and<br>kind of say how well do you tolerate<br>these drugs they these chemicals they<br>tolerate them but they're not really<br>they don't want to take huge huge<br>quantities and then also with your green<br>tea it's got a um caffeine in it so<br>everybody knows what's the side effects<br>of a high dose caffeine so people<br>weren't that thrilled to have those<br>kinds of side effects so we started<br>thinking well what can we learn from<br>what we've learned from egcg and Kirkman<br>you'll see maybe if you can remember my<br>first PhD was all about structure<br>activity so I'm kind of a structure<br>activity kind of person deep down and so<br>basically we came up with this idea we<br>need a better scheme and so the scheme<br>should be we be we be we need kind of a<br>better regime and the regime should be<br>we better be potent in vitro way more<br>potent than any of these natural<br>compounds because if we're potent in<br>vitro we've got a better<br>shot we want want to be orally available<br>after a single dose and we want to check<br>that so any drug that's potent in vitro<br>but not orally available is not going to<br>keep testing because then there's no<br>point okay and only those that are<br>orally available will move on to invivo<br>models to see if they're efficacious and<br>those that are efficacious we'll make<br>sure they're safe and then<br>so this is has been a was kind of like a<br>career changing thing for me I think<br>because<br>um George here who many of you may know<br>for a variety of reasons um and<br>sometimes a bit irritating and and<br>Troublesome and not that that didn't<br>happen to me as well but I owe him a<br>huge gr debt of gratitude because<br>without George George said to me oh<br>never mind I'm not GNA say what George<br>would say because then I'll do it in a<br>bad Scottish accent George got me<br>working with Leslie Larson and he was<br>the Catalyst for that and i' I owe him a<br>huge debt of gratitude for that because<br>without George I wouldn't have met<br>Leslie and without Leslie I wouldn't<br>have done a whole heap of stuff I'm<br>about to show you so Leslie was huge and<br>she and I had a great long prolific<br>relationship um and so she's the chemist<br>who makes all the drugs I'm going to<br>talk to about so we wanted to con<br>concentrate on triple negative breast<br>cancer but at the time when we were<br>doing this work her septin was not<br>approved in New Zealand so we also<br>thought while we've got the tools let's<br>also look at her too as well<br>okay<br>so just to so um a little bit of<br>chemistry so here's Kirin that's in the<br>green tea and that this part here is the<br>part that makes it unstable and we knew<br>from other literature that it's likely<br>that when you remove these methoxy<br>groups you start to lose activity so we<br>thought the methoxy are probably<br>important and we just need a better<br>Linker system so Leslie is the driver<br>for this and she made two different<br>Linker systems<br>and then we start messing around with<br>the substituents over here and we start<br>moving methoxy around and so we put<br>methoxy in different positions we put<br>some nitrogens in we put some five<br>membered sulfur rings in and we did all<br>kinds of different structures and then<br>she also had a methyl padone um Linker<br>system and again we concentrated on the<br>nitrogens and the methoxy groups so I'm<br>going to show you the data from some of<br>these compounds and um but basically we<br>just gave them sort of madeup name so<br>that it's all going to be RL 7166 so the<br>ones we're going to talk about are these<br>two and these two down here 9091 these<br>are going to be the big ones so you'll<br>see these numbers letter systems coming<br>up and these are the compounds that we<br>found to be the most effective so if<br>circumin is your<br>benchmark then you want to compare to<br>circumin so we wanted something way more<br>potent than Kirin so part of this slide<br>is to show you that you don't always get<br>it right and you can make things that<br>are worse so anything in green was a<br>compound we synthesized and wasn't as<br>good you know but you doesn't always<br>work but then we have a whole Suite who<br>were much more potent orders of<br>magnitudes more potent at killing um<br>breast cancer cells so what we have in<br>this table is triple negative breast<br>cancer cells and these ones don't have<br>the estrogen receptor but are positive<br>for her too okay and so we did a whole<br>bunch of different cell lines I'll just<br>show you these and essentially for you<br>people the smaller this number is the<br>way better better effect we've got and<br>the happier we are and that's what we<br>wanted we wanted something for us at the<br>outset we said if we can get the number<br>lower than one we're GNA that's kind of<br>our<br>Target okay so again and now maybe I'll<br>just go back to this one kirkin from the<br>literature we all knew standard things<br>that Kirkman does it induces<br>apoptosis it arrests cells in the G2<br>phase of the cell cycle it affects all<br>kinds of different signaling proteins so<br>these are things we're expecting our<br>derivatives to do as well and they're<br>all and you know they're going to I'm<br>going to show you that that's true and<br>so just to let you know that this won't<br>go on forever I'm only going to show you<br>one thing from one compound because they<br>all do the same thing it's just a a<br>level of potency so here's no matter<br>which compound I picked all the growth<br>curves look roughly like this so the red<br>line is the control cells growing and<br>the blue line is the effect of the drug<br>and so essentially you keep the cells<br>from growing over the 72 hours or in<br>some cases you automatically kill them<br>off so basically at the end this is way<br>more cancer cells growing than there is<br>down for the treated so we're happy with<br>the<br>potency this is a slide showing you that<br>they arrest cells in the G2 phase of the<br>cell cycle um and all the different<br>compounds again did this this is showing<br>you that they induce apoptosis and they<br>do this with a Vengeance especially this<br>rl71 compound 40% almost half of the<br>cell population undergoing apoptosis is<br>a is a huge result for a one micromolar<br>concentration in the dish so we're<br>really happy with this and how strongly<br>these compounds are working so this is<br>meeting our test of must be potent in<br>vitro to go<br>on okay and so now this is all four<br>compounds but this was kind of a<br>dramatic thing that I think is Worth<br>showing you don't normally see such an<br>early and complete Wipeout of her two so<br>no matter what compound we put in the<br>only difference is four to one<br>micromolar we always around 3 hours wipe<br>out her two and keep her two suppressed<br>so this was sort of it's good to see it<br>consistent and um<br>um and down so that's the big thing so<br>when you don't have her two so again now<br>this is the triple negative you're going<br>to see some of these words I showed you<br>before you affect and decrease akt mtor<br>a downstream effector of mtor and NF<br>Capa B so these are all things that<br>drive cell growth and so this is not<br>happening in these cells when you doing<br>them in the<br>dish okay so I told you I want to be<br>able to see it orally in the plasma so<br>these curves both show you and all we<br>want to do is say we can find it and so<br>both of these show that yes we can find<br>this in the dish I mean sorry in the<br>dish in the mouse so the mouse gets a<br>single dose of the compound and we look<br>for it in the blood over time so this is<br>just minutes after the dose and it stays<br>so basically we can so any compounds<br>that we found in the plasma then went on<br>to effic E efficacy studies in the mouse<br>so here's three different graphs where<br>we're looking at that same kind of graph<br>I showed you before where you dose the<br>mouse orally every day now the one big<br>thing that I like about this study and<br>that what Leslie was so awesome with is<br>she made salt forms of the drug and<br>everybody in the room knows salt<br>dissolves in water so if you want to<br>give a dose if you want to give a drug<br>to a human a water solubility is<br>fantastic so in this case too our<br>vehicle which is how what you dissolve<br>the drug in it's just water so our<br>control is water that's all you have to<br>give them out you give them water or you<br>give them the drug and that's that's an<br>awesome way to have a study so that was<br>fantastic that Leslie can do that<br>so I kind of have that I don't know I'm<br>never happy enough kind of thing you<br>know I mean I like to you know sure we<br>got tumor suppression I it's good i'<br>like it better um and then one of the<br>other things that we um what I don't<br>show you here is that the rl71 One Drug<br>was the one that was working so well in<br>vitro half the cells were apop toing all<br>that kind of thing and it's not on here<br>because it didn't work so then a few<br>years ago I hired Ked Gres and he had<br>patent this styring malic acid<br>nanotechnology and basically um it's<br>really not for me to explain his patent<br>but basic I'm going to have to so the<br>whole point of this is you take the drug<br>you put it inside this carrier sorry col<br>I hope he's not here um and the whole<br>point of the carrier system is it's<br>going to keep the drug from well there's<br>not there's lots of points keeps the<br>drug from being<br>degraded um the the great thing about it<br>is it's going to specifically bring the<br>drug to the tumor based on the the fact<br>that tumor vasculature is different to<br>normal vasculature so it's the size of<br>the drug that's going to make it get<br>through that tumor vasculature so you're<br>specifically targeting the tumor and if<br>you specifically Target the tumor this<br>should be obvious to everybody you<br>obviously need less dose if it's not<br>going to get around it should be safer<br>um and you should be able to give fewer<br>doses with fewer side effects so that's<br>the whole Crux of this<br>technology so um ked's been great and<br>he's done that and so basically this is<br>us so here you can see what it's done<br>for us is it's taken rl71 which wasn't<br>effective and it's turned it into an<br>effective drug and these words down here<br>which I forgot to say on any of my other<br>tumor slides whenever we treat a mouse<br>with a drug we always make sure it's<br>safe and it wouldn't show you any tumor<br>um regression curve if the drug wasn't<br>safe okay so this basically means<br>there's no liver injury there the mice<br>are healthy so we always look at that<br>when we're doing these kinds of<br>things okay<br>so almost<br>done I just want to tell you a couple<br>things and we'll take a little break<br>from data and then I got there's some<br>other really cool data I want to show<br>you and then we'll be done okay so I<br>just want to tell you a kind of story<br>it's always good to make fun of yourself<br>so I want to talk to you about some of<br>my<br>collaborations and the importance of<br>going to meetings most everybody knows<br>that but um just want us reinforce this<br>I met Mark<br>Dietrich at an oncology meeting in<br>Greece and he came up to me afterwards<br>and go and said hey can I share some<br>your can you share your drugs with me<br>and I said yes and so we wrote this<br>paper together this makes me look really<br>bad because James Paxton who at the time<br>was headed Department in Auckland<br>pharmacology by the way you'd think I'd<br>have a good you know communication<br>system with James Paxton I didn't so<br>much and James Rings me one day and he<br>says I was at this meeting and there was<br>this guy from Luxembourg sorry Mark from<br>Luxembourg and he had these really cool<br>Kiran derivatives and he was<br>collaborating with someone from New<br>Zealand but he went so fast I didn't<br>catch who it was that wouldn't happened<br>to be you was it I said yes absolutely<br>it is me he said will you share your<br>drugs with me because we're really<br>interested in multi-drug resistance and<br>cancer I said absolutely so so I we're<br>still I'm still working with James so<br>it's embarrassing that some he had to go<br>travel outside of New Zealand to find<br>this out but that's but thank goodness<br>for Mark spreading the word and then I<br>had another collaborative PTI paper with<br>um euphemia in in Auckland I met her<br>through normal channels so um the good<br>stories are over but euphemia has really<br>cool breast cancer um cell lines that<br>she's made which are resistant for to<br>tamoxifen so they resemble what would<br>happen in a patient when you take<br>tamoxifen for a long time and you<br>eventually come resistant to the drug<br>and our drugs worked really well in her<br>resistant cell line so that was nice and<br>then sort of my piece to resist Don as<br>being able to work with Steve again and<br>I was at a talks meeting and I convinced<br>him that our drugs were worth studying<br>and and so we published this paper so um<br>I guess take- home messages it doesn't<br>always have to be you who goes to the<br>meeting um well I probably shouldn't<br>shouldn't say that should I now see now<br>Vern's going to go you don't need to go<br>to that<br>meeting okay now so not much to go I<br>just want to say that a little bit about<br>relox ofine so this was some work we did<br>so I want to call this when a serms not<br>a serm so I explained to you before that<br>these are good for estrogen receptor<br>positive breast cancer but we found that<br>they actually work um in a triple<br>negative environment so this is two<br>different tumor models and there are two<br>different xenographs of two different<br>triple negative breast cancers and then<br>the the other key thing you can see so<br>the stuff down the bottom this is<br>basically our drug working fantastically<br>this is one of my favorite ones I love<br>this one um and and so and then the<br>other really good thing about this is<br>some people think animal work means you<br>must have these horrific Doses and it's<br>not relevant to humans this these two<br>effects here this is doses much lower a<br>human who takes relox ofine gets a 60<br>milligram pill we're giving a 3<br>milligram to 5 milligram dose so it's<br>far far lower than so this is that's one<br>of my favorite Gra<br>um and so what's happening in those<br>tumors so this kind of shows you if it's<br>brown the cells are dividing that's<br>ki67 lien up the brown so this shows you<br>that the the cells inside the tumor<br>aren't dividing and then when you see<br>the brown over here it means the cells<br>inside that tumor are being told to die<br>so the cells are dying and not<br>growing and then in those tumor so this<br>is all the tumors from those mice that<br>get taken out and the tumors we decrease<br>egfr by the relux treatment and then and<br>because sorry this is a a sore point<br>with me with people who can't get their<br>heads around um the fact that there's no<br>estrogen receptor but there's no<br>estrogen receptor you see nothing for<br>you don't know what you're looking at if<br>you didn't look like I ran on there with<br>a black Sharpie then that means there's<br>no estrogen receptor there's no protein<br>there it's blank okay and then in those<br>tumors when you take them out of the<br>animal this is a marker for<br>neoangiogenesis so this means are there<br>blood vessels in that tumor that could<br>make it metastasize and we wipe out the<br>blood blood vessels and this is the<br>quantification so we significantly<br>decrease those so we were we were<br>showing that relox does have potentially<br>a role in a triple negative<br>environment okay and so when you know<br>that triple negative breast cancer is<br>very similar to hormone refractory<br>prostate cancer and that this is another<br>so for males this is very equivalent of<br>the cancer that doesn't have very many<br>treatment options and is very aggressive<br>and has a poor prognosis so because<br>relox ofine was working in that female<br>version we thought well let's see what<br>happens with relox ofine in um the male<br>version so we did relox ofine and we<br>also we love our Kirin derivatives so we<br>like to put them together and so this is<br>here's all the different doses of of the<br>the derivative here's the different<br>concentrations of relox ofine and<br>basically again if you want to do the<br>sort of math how good is it this plus<br>this gives you that so basically we're<br>wiping out over 90% of the cancer cells<br>by this combination so this was really<br>cool and I was really excited about this<br>but I don't really want to talk to you<br>about combination I just want to talk to<br>you about relox ofine because this is an<br>unknown entity this is a new chemical<br>it's going to be a lot harder to get<br>that into the clinic but relox ofine is<br>already approved and known to be safe so<br>we also wanted to work just on relox<br>because we could get that into males<br>much quicker so here's this showing that<br>um the egfr goes into to the cytoplasm<br>and so it's basically going from where<br>it's active to where it's not going to<br>be active and over time more and more<br>gets over<br>there then this is something we've just<br>recently finished in the last few months<br>and this is relox ofine in an orthotopic<br>model so an orthotopic model is when you<br>take the human cancer cells and put it<br>into the mouse prostate so this is the<br>best possible model you can have because<br>it mimics everything about the disease<br>the cells are where they're supposed to<br>be the cells will metastasize and go to<br>other organs and<br>so here's here's all the so well anyway<br>I don't even have we don't have to point<br>to that because instead of trying to go<br>are those really smaller we can I can<br>just quantify them for you and yes the<br>treatment is a much smaller tumor than<br>the than the vehicle control and these<br>are all the lymph nodes and does do the<br>cells go to the lymph nodes and make<br>them bigger and um yes they do and so<br>the beauty again of putting the human<br>cells into the mouse prostate is how can<br>you tell the cells have gone on where<br>they were supposed to did they really<br>travel well it's a human cell so a mouse<br>isn't going to have human human<br>mitochondria anywhere unless the cell<br>took it there so so this is basically<br>saying staining for mitochondria in the<br>lymph nodes that's human and the only<br>way it could have got there is if the<br>tomb if the cell that was in the<br>prostate M migrated over to the lymph<br>node right so so this shows that we you<br>know because you could look at that and<br>go ah it's not so good but yes we've<br>decreased this and um<br>also what's cool about this technology<br>is we use the um invivo live Imaging so<br>this is where you can um use less<br>animals because it's far more accurate<br>and basically what you do this basically<br>shows you there's the prostate tumor and<br>there's it migrating to the lymph node<br>so that's a mouse with the lymph node<br>metastasis and then this is a mouse with<br>no metastasis so you can look at that<br>over time and and do all that sort of<br>thing so it it decreases animalic usage<br>so the only other thing I want to say<br>this was Eli's gold model that she was<br>working on at manash and then brought<br>here and we were lucky enough to work<br>with her on that and so we're still<br>working on that paper but the only other<br>thing that I want to say is it's really<br>one of my goals is to do everything we<br>can to keep this work going so we will<br>um we will do our best and try to do<br>else the proud and um keep this work<br>going okay so one last thing about relox<br>ofine is um there's khid again and I<br>should have said this before oh wait no<br>I sorry because I'm I realize I'm almost<br>done and so I'm just going to kind of<br>slow down a little bit and make sure I<br>do a few things um this is my assistant<br>research phari I could have probably put<br>her on almost every slide for the past<br>10<br>slides this is my research fellow<br>Sebastian um I probably could have put<br>on him on slides from my PhD except he<br>probably wasn't born but he's been huge<br>so both of them have been Mass I'm sure<br>somehow Sebastian um telepathy<br>influenced me when I was in my postto or<br>something but he's been just I couldn't<br>do any you know they should be here<br>Leslie should be here it's all their<br>work they're the really the hard ones<br>and it's been fantastic to work with<br>them so anyway here's College Sebastian<br>and a recent Master student and so they<br>did that carrier thing again remember<br>the carrier they did the staring malic<br>acid and put um relox ofine in that and<br>so here's<br>another tumor curve and I realized I<br>didn't do this on the other one on the<br>71 one so I do it here and you can<br>translate and realize where I screwed up<br>the other great thing about this<br>technology is see and this one's got<br>better prompts for me where the arrows<br>are these mice are only getting four<br>doses okay where all those other ones<br>was a daily dose so this is kind of<br>reinforcing the fact that with this<br>technology you give less drug so and<br>essentially what this means is the blue<br>and the red are the same effect except<br>for<br>the red is a can't yeah the red is the<br>one mixed so the red is five inside the<br>styring malic acid at a fivefold lower<br>dose so the blue is not in in is the<br>free drug and it does roughly the same<br>as the the drug in the carrier but at a<br>fivefold lower dose you know so again<br>when you can lower the dose you decrease<br>side effects decrease um those sorts of<br>things okay<br>so Vernon kind of brought this up and I<br>just had to include this slide because<br>as excited as I am about research and<br>anybody I hope who knows me thinks I'm<br>excited about<br>research I do think it's very important<br>to have an impact in the undergraduate<br>classroom and so this as much as I'm<br>proud of a lot of the data I've got this<br>is one of my proudest papers was when we<br>were able to take a novel um Concept in<br>the undergraduate classroom and submit<br>it to the Journal of molecular biology<br>and biochemistry and molecular biology<br>education and have them publish that and<br>also for people in<br>science this paper is being cited so<br>people are reading it and citing it so<br>um and Katherine she can't be here she's<br>in the US but she helped me write it and<br>did some other things um survey the<br>students and that sort of thing so I'm<br>really really really um proud and happy<br>to do this um to show this um because to<br>me it's it's if you're not in the<br>undergraduate classroom and excited you<br>know that's why we're here they're the<br>ones who pay the toour and they're over<br>here right yeah exactly I thought she I<br>have wait where those notes you yeah<br>yeah<br>um so this is just kind of showing you<br>that you're kind of a product of your<br>environment and things don't change um I<br>still like to go outside and do lots of<br>crazy things um I still dress up in<br>funny<br>costumes and I still hang out with dogs<br>um and as much as I love hanging out<br>with dogs I did realize that hanging out<br>with children is far<br>better and um so this just some people's<br>family shies away from the camera I<br>don't have that problem so this is just<br>a little Montage to say thank you family<br>it's been a great nine years and I've<br>had an awesome time so thank you very<br>much and thank everybody for coming out<br>on a hot night<br>well thank you very much Ronda excellent<br>talk so I guess uh it falls to me to<br>give a something of a summary of what<br>went on that was rather interesting I<br>was praying that the things I thought of<br>ahead of time would would work they have<br>so thank you for that the I guess one of<br>the things that struck me I I saw the um<br>the slides ahead of time and I was<br>looking saying what would you summarize<br>what would you bring together out of<br>this and I think one of the things I had<br>was that you often as you going through<br>your career have some difficult<br>decisions to make and what you have to<br>do along the way and everybody goes<br>through this where am I going to go do<br>my post how am I going to get it funded<br>where am I going to get job somewhere<br>I've got my PhD what I do now how do I<br>learn to teach where do I go for my<br>faculty positions we all face those some<br>some of them work really well sometimes<br>maybe not so well but you have to do the<br>best out of them and get stuff out of<br>them and I think Ronda has clearly shown<br>that she would do that the you know it's<br>the same when you look at your research<br>You all take some challenges and ronda's<br>talked to us a bit about drug<br>development today and I'm going to sort<br>of take the Kirkman example that was<br>sitting there and I think Nigel<br>hopefully not going to cringe too much<br>at this point but if you look at a lot<br>of natural products out there there's a<br>lot of chemistry in natural products<br>there's a lot of things that have<br>bioactivity are they always perfect no<br>they're not going to be but what they do<br>is they give you your leads and so maybe<br>you don't get the perfect result you<br>want but you can make that step forward<br>and use that as your starting point and<br>make that decision to track through and<br>so if you look at um some of the stuff<br>for example working there with bioactive<br>molecules the ability to develop them in<br>combination and go beyond single<br>treatments the ability to develop new<br>compounds that have new types of<br>activity the decisions to look at how do<br>you make them bioavailable how do you<br>deliver them the ability to get them to<br>where they need to be in the animal all<br>those things are really important steps<br>along the developmental pathway and what<br>those actually force you to do is look<br>at a whole raft of biology and what you<br>saw from Ronda today was looking at<br>understanding the biology of a system<br>understanding the chemistry of a system<br>and you look at the range of people that<br>she worked with she's looking at stuff<br>at the applied end of the spectrum doing<br>really good basic biom Medical Science<br>and she strung that whole set together<br>and it takes that Spectrum to be able to<br>develop new things being able to do<br>basic biomedical science understanding<br>the biology of your system bringing the<br>team of people together to have your<br>chemists to have your pharmacologists to<br>have your exp toxicologist to have the<br>people that understand those systems and<br>I think that's really important and was<br>one of the things that that I certainly<br>took from Bron ronda's talk is that<br>breadth and the scope of people she<br>worked with to get to a point which is<br>really quite exciting so I think that<br>was very good thank you very much now<br>I'm aware of time and I'm sure everybody<br>doesn't want to hear me going on for a<br>long period of time but I think it was<br>an excellent talk Ronda and I guess I<br>get to the point where um oh my we're<br>getting towards the end and I have two<br>final tasks to do the first of them is<br>to show a little token of our<br>appreciation recognition something for<br>your office I think but also a little<br>something for you as well as part of it<br>and the final task I get is to pass over<br>to the deputy Vice Chancellor academic<br>Squire thank you very much Vernon<br>um my job involves too many meetings and<br>like the vice<br>Chancellor coming to talks like this<br>remind me just what being in a<br>university is all about and it was a<br>real privilege to sit here tonight and<br>listen to Ronda tell us about her life<br>story the other thing I want to mention<br>is there are two Vernon in this room and<br>every time I hear the name Vernon<br>because my name's Vernon and his name's<br>Vernon I jump because if I was called<br>John there'll be 10 John's here but<br>unfortunately because we're both called<br>Vernon we both react simultaneous L and<br>think we're being called at the same<br>time anyway enough of that my job is<br>really to thank you for coming out this<br>evening especially on this beautiful<br>warm evening when um you could be<br>sitting on the back deck drinking beer<br>but you chose the right you made the<br>right choice uh but what we would like<br>you to do is join us in the staff Club<br>upstairs for Refreshments thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
