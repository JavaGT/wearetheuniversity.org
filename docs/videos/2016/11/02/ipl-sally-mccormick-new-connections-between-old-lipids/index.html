tonight<br>unfortunately harleen Hayne is in<br>Wellington and can't be here and uh told<br>me before she left that she very much<br>regretted that and uh to apologize<br>personally to to Sally so welcome<br>everyone excuse me to Professor Sally<br>McMac uh inaugural professorial<br>lecture and a very very special welcome<br>to Sally's family her mom and dad<br>Heather and<br>Kevin her two children Todd and Kelly<br>her two brothers Simon and Nan and their<br>wives Nicola and Sandra three nieces<br>Rachel Lauren and Anna<br>and Sally's partner Neil<br>welcome these events are very special to<br>me personally as they represent one of<br>the few occasions where I'm reminded<br>what this universities is all is all<br>about it's about First Rate research<br>it's about outstanding<br>teachers and of course it's about our<br>students contrary to what my job<br>normally<br>involves it is not about budget<br>committees writing and actioning<br>strategic plans and externally imposed<br>bureaucracy it's more about the<br>opportunity to hear from a top<br>scholar about her successes in her<br>chosen field in this case<br>biochemistry now getting to be a full<br>Professor here is as challenging<br>if not more<br>challenging as any University in the<br>world including the highest ranked<br>ones but unlike many we measure all<br>aspects of the<br>job being the chair of the Staffing<br>advisory committee and usually in fact<br>always sitting on professorial<br>appointment committees allows me to say<br>that with some confidence applicants for<br>Professor must demonstrate sustained<br>outstanding leadership and<br>competence in two out of the three areas<br>of teaching research and<br>service and they must demonstrate<br>sustained outstanding competence in the<br>third<br>area in Sally's case she has shown<br>distinction in teaching<br>evaluations where she sits consistently<br>in the Excellence range she has won the<br>OS Ms distinguished academic teacher<br>award but she's also shown a<br>considerable history of innovation in<br>course development underpinned by a<br>strong commitment to research informed<br>case-based teaching using real life<br>examples Sally has been primary<br>supervisor of 11 PhD students 10 Master<br>students and 16 honors<br>students likewise Sally's service has<br>been of the highest standard<br>possible both in regard to her<br>professional commitments through<br>conference<br>organization Outreach and public<br>work in the B byom medai undergraduate<br>and postgraduate<br>programs she served as Deputy head of<br>the biochemistry Department as<br>well a major output of research papers<br>in high quality journals with<br>significant professional uptake has<br>produced an impressive H index which is<br>a measure of research<br>productivity while Sally's capacity to<br>bring in significant Revenue to support<br>her research well over $3<br>million has always been welcomed by the<br>University please continue<br>Sally these CR credentials reflect a<br>level of scholarship that provoked<br>strong comments from a field of<br>international referees during the<br>application process to to become a<br>professor I quote Dr<br>mccat mccor is an internationally<br>recognized<br>Authority she is recognized for her<br>pioneering work and possibly most<br>tellingly one of her PhD students<br>presented one of the best PhD thesis<br>that I have ever<br>read a personal congratulations from me<br>Sally for this exceptional performance I<br>would like now like to introduce<br>Professor Vernon Ward the dean of osns<br>who will give a brief biographical<br>you welcome everybody it's great to see<br>you all here this evening and um I'm<br>really delighted to have the pleasure of<br>giving a brief biological sketch of uh<br>Professor S mccor as she does her inal<br>professorial lecture today um so I have<br>the privilege of giving just a little<br>bit of background there I won't won't<br>embarrass Sally too much I threatened I<br>would but I won't and um basically for<br>those of you who don't know she started<br>her academic career with the bachelor Of<br>Agricultural Science with honors from<br>Lincoln College she then went on to do a<br>PhD um through Lincoln University but it<br>was based at the Christ Church school of<br>medicine as it was known at the time and<br>her thesis title was hypera<br>lipoproteinemia in truncated forms of<br>human apolp protein B she will tell you<br>what that means I won't but the I think<br>the the real message here is right from<br>an early stage of her of her academic<br>career it was very clear she knew what<br>she wanted to work on and why she wanted<br>to work on it and I think that shows<br>through so it's still still there those<br>lipids so after attaining her PhD she<br>went to the gladston Institute of<br>cardiovascular um disease in San<br>Francisco she started there as a<br>post-doctoral fellow and moved on become<br>to become a senior um research scientist<br>there she then returned um to New<br>Zealand and picked up the lectur ship<br>here at a Taro in Biochemistry and where<br>she's continued through and worked away<br>through the ranks of the senior<br>lectureship associate professor and now<br>Professor um within the department and<br>within the school of medical sciences<br>and these are very richly<br>deserved her research focus is the<br>regulation of molecules involved in<br>heart disease with a particular interest<br>in plasma lipo proteins that determine<br>blood cholesterol levels and so that's<br>the sort of topic and the theme that<br>she's going to present to you this<br>evening now I'm not going to talk about<br>that because or leave her to present to<br>you what is that she's going to talk<br>about and I guess I would just like to<br>reiterate a few of the things that<br>Professor Vernon Squire commented on<br>about the the sort of three pillars if<br>you will of an academic career your<br>service your research and your teaching<br>and those were highlighted but I'd also<br>like to bring out the collaborations<br>from around the world that Sally has<br>which recognize her skills and her<br>knowledge and her base you know she's on<br>HRC assessment panels she's on a whole<br>rough of different granting body panels<br>done assessment of grants that whole<br>service side of it really comes through<br>strong as well as her research the<br>Awards She's picked up with teaching I'm<br>nominated for supervisor of the Year by<br>the tarer university Students<br>Association the list goes on and on and<br>I think it's really impressive when you<br>see somebody that's done quite that many<br>things so it's really really well done<br>so it's a really Broad and impressive<br>academic career and I'm sure she'll give<br>a wonderful lecture this evening so it's<br>with great pleasure that I ask Sally to<br>present her inaugural profesori lecture<br>entitled new connections between old<br>Lepard<br>Vernon ipu a<br>a ton<br>Mari Nora Teno Teno tanoto Kor welcome<br>everyone welcome family friends and<br>colleagues and<br>groupies to my uh professorial lecture<br>it's really good that you can be here<br>tonight just want to mention a couple of<br>very important people that are in the<br>audience tonight firstly my parents<br>Heather and Kevin I'm just so grateful<br>that you can be here tonight um to share<br>with me this event and to be here to<br>support me also want to mention my two<br>children Todd and Kelly Kelly actually<br>marks my tenure here at Oto because she<br>was born um just before I came to Oto<br>and this is a picture of her and Todd<br>here Todd was about seven at the time<br>and this is them<br>now I don't know what<br>happened they grew up well sort of<br>and um I'm pleased that they're here to<br>to hear this<br>tonight so what I'm going to tell you<br>about tonight is a Tail of Two lipo<br>proteins um these These are the um<br>complexes of lipid and proteins which<br>carry fats in our blood so when you go<br>to your GP and you get a lipid test and<br>they're measuring your cholesterol and<br>your triglyceride levels they are<br>actually measuring the lipids contained<br>in these particles here known as<br>lipoproteins and there's five different<br>classes of lipoproteins and I've spent<br>the most part of 20 years um researching<br>two of them one called lipoprotein<br>little a and the other called<br>HDL and so I've had two major research<br>programs going on while I've been here<br>at otago one on lipoprotein little a and<br>the other one on HDL and these programs<br>have been completely independent of each<br>other but just in the last two years<br>we've found a connection between these<br>two um different lipoproteins and I'll<br>talk about that at the end of my uh<br>lecture tonight but first I want to tell<br>you a little bit about my uh lipoprotein<br>a program and then I'll talk a little<br>bit about the HDL program and then I'll<br>talk about the connection that we've<br>found but first say just a little bit<br>about myself and Vernon has already<br>touched on<br>this these were my marks uh my final<br>year at<br>Lincoln now it looks like I'm a straight<br>A student<br>but an actual fact if you translate<br>those marks into the aago system it's a<br>b an A minus an A minus and a b pretty<br>mediocre actually and not a biochemistry<br>degree and not even a<br>university so it can only get better<br>from<br>here so that was where I started and so<br>hopefully tonight I can tell you a<br>little bit about how I came to be a<br>professor in Biochemistry there was a<br>little bit of bioch chemistry in here in<br>fact my honors dissertation was very<br>biochemical it was on hemoglobin<br>variants associated with<br>anemia and it was during my honors<br>project that I learned that I was really<br>interested in research but also that I<br>grew a love of blood<br>proteins so proteins in the blood and<br>particularly those that were involved in<br>disease and this continued um on and I<br>did my PhD project actually in the same<br>lab<br>uh at the Christ Church School of<br>Medicine with uh Dr Peter George and<br>here I studied a man that had a really<br>low cholesterol level and turned out<br>that he had a truncated or short form of<br>a very important protein called<br>epob which uh is uh A protein that<br>carries cholesterol in the<br>blood so while I was doing my<br>PhD I came in contact with this man here<br>Dr Steven young who had just set up a<br>very successful lipid metabolism Lab at<br>The gladestone Institute in San<br>Francisco and I started communicating<br>with him while I was doing um my PhD and<br>ended up that I went to his lab in San<br>Francisco to do my post doog so I went<br>there in<br>1993 um and was with Steve for three and<br>a half<br>years Steve was an absolutely fantastic<br>Mentor he taught me many many things I<br>think the two main things he taught me<br>was one always be thinking about the<br>next experiment and two right well and<br>he was a fabulous writer he's published<br>over 300 papers scientific papers are<br>fairly boring they're full of scientific<br>jargon they're very<br>repetitive but Steve used to write<br>papers like a novel and I'll always be<br>indepted to him for teaching me how to<br>write uh Steve has actually just been<br>inducted into the the National Academy<br>of Sciences in the US which is one of<br>the highest accolades that a scientist<br>can gain so he's a very famous man and<br>I'm just very lucky that I went to his<br>lab to do my<br>posttop while I was in his lab I<br>developed an interest in this molecule<br>here known as lipoprotein little a now<br>most of you won't have heard of<br>lipoprotein little a but you will have<br>heard of LDL or lowdensity lipoprotein<br>otherwise known as the bad cholesterol<br>LDL is the one that gets stuck in your<br>arteries accumulates causes an<br>accumulation of lipid or fats in your<br>arteries and ultimately um as a as a<br>very important risk factor for<br>developing heart disease LP little a is<br>kind of like ll's cousin because it's<br>very highly related the only difference<br>is that it has an extra protein stuck to<br>it and that protein is known as epol<br>little a epol little a is thought to<br>have evolved from plas which is a<br>protein involved in the breakdown of<br>blood<br>clots now this is what LP a looks like<br>under the microscope it's just a blob<br>with a bit of a shadowy bit around the<br>outside this is the artist impression I<br>prefer this one we'll stick with this<br>prettier so what was known about<br>lipoprotein little a or what is known<br>about lipoprotein little a is that it's<br>a very important risk factor for<br>developing heart disease it was first<br>1963 and I was very very fortunate<br>fortunate in 2002 to actually meet the<br>man that discovered lipoprotein little a<br>a Norwegian physician by the name of K<br>Berg who discovered LPA in 1963 this is<br>his original paper and at the time no<br>one really thought much about it they<br>just thought oh it's a variant of LDL<br>it's probably not going to amount to to<br>much and so not much was was done on<br>Alpay for a long time but over the<br>years what has accumulated in the<br>literature is that very large clinical<br>Studies have shown that elevated levels<br>of lipoprotein little a are very<br>important risk factor for heart disease<br>if you have elevated levels you're at<br>twofold risk of developing heart disease<br>if you have extremely high levels you're<br>more likely four or five times to be at<br>risk of developing a heart attack<br>we also know that present in aoic tissue<br>so biopsies taken from people that have<br>died of heart attacks when they look at<br>their arteries they see that Alpay is<br>accumulated in the arteries and also<br>there's been studies on uh transgenic<br>mice and rabbits who don't normally have<br>lipoprotein L A but who can be<br>engineered to um Carry Alp in their<br>blood and they develop<br>ecosis what is missing from the lipopro<br>little a field is an intervention trial<br>and what I mean by intervention trial is<br>that where you take a drug or a therapy<br>that will lower a risk factor and you<br>see that it lowers the rates of heart<br>attacks and that is missing from the<br>Alpa field and the reason why I think<br>it's missing is that we don't know<br>enough about the lipoprotein little a<br>molecule and when I came to atago in<br>1996 there were three major questions<br>about lipoprotein delay that that hadn't<br>been answered and so I set about um with<br>my research program trying to answer<br>some of these questions the first<br>question was how is it<br>assembled what we did know was that<br>there was a dulfi link a cross link<br>between the epol little a protein and<br>the EPO B protein which is the major<br>protein sitting on the LDL molecule but<br>we didn't know much about how these<br>proteins came to be together we didn't<br>know anything about Alpa<br>function and there a lot of people don't<br>actually have Alp lay in their blood<br>about 10% of people actually don't have<br>Alpay about some of you won't have any<br>Alp lay and those people that don't have<br>it are perfect seem to be perfectly fine<br>so the question is well why do we have<br>it what's its role we knew a lot about<br>how it was involved in heart disease but<br>we didn't know what its actual function<br>was so that was another question that I<br>hope to get some information on the<br>third question was how is it catabolized<br>and what I mean by that is how is it<br>taken up by cells how is it cleared from<br>the blood and so that was another<br>question that uh we wanted to<br>answer so starting with the first<br>question the first um project that I did<br>at otago was trying to understand how<br>Alp a was<br>assembled so LDL is actually derived<br>from vldl which is a much much bigger<br>lipoprotein I couldn't fit the LDL on<br>the slide CU it would block out the<br>whole slide so it's a big particle and<br>it gets secreted by the liver and it<br>gets converted to LDL in the bloodstream<br>in circulation by a series of enzymes<br>that um basically metabolize it its<br>lipids to make it a smaller<br>particle and the appoa component this<br>component here it also gets secreted by<br>the liver and in the free form and<br>somehow the LDL and the epoa magically<br>find each other in circulation and<br>that's quite a big ask because there's<br>lots of things floating around in our<br>blood lots of proteins um including lots<br>of proteins with uh free cines which<br>could cross link to each other so it was<br>thought that there must be something<br>special that brings these two things<br>together before we get this cross link<br>formed and so I proposed a two-step<br>model for Alp assembly<br>shown here where the cross link was<br>actually the second step in a two-step<br>model and the first step was some kind<br>of uh non-covalent association between<br>these two proteins the epoa protein and<br>the EPO protein on the surface of L that<br>actually got these two proteins together<br>in the first place for the two cines to<br>be able to form a cross link and during<br>my posttop um years I had managed to<br>produce a number of mutant for mutant<br>forms of epob including two that were<br>truncated<br>forms uh an EPO b97 and an EPO<br>b95 and what I'd shown with these two<br>different short versions of the epob<br>protein was that the b97 formed lpla<br>very well as good as the fulllength epob<br>but the b95 didn't form uh Alp very well<br>at all so that got us uh thinking about<br>the sequences between 95 and 97 because<br>we thought there must be something in<br>here that's important for getting these<br>two proteins<br>together and uh I had a u in fact my<br>very first PhD student Katherine Lou did<br>some studies uh on some of these mutants<br>and she found a sequence that was in in<br>the 95 to 97 region that was rich in<br>lysines and we were exced exced about<br>that because we thought lysine residues<br>might be involved because the epoa<br>protein has lysine binding domains uh<br>and contained in its structure and so we<br>thought well it's probably binding to<br>lysin on fob so we had a sequence here<br>it was about 21 amino acids and what my<br>very first PhD student Katherine did was<br>she mutated those lysine residues and<br>what she showed with this mutant epob<br>was that it didn't form Alpa very well<br>at all<br>and to further confirm that these<br>sequences were<br>important we took this approach here<br>where we actually synthesized a peptide<br>which is a short protein sequence to<br>that sequence and we asked the questions<br>well would this peptide bind to epoa<br>because we thought it should if it's<br>important and then in doing so it might<br>well keep the epoa protein away from LDL<br>and actually prevent Alpa from ever<br>forming<br>and so I had a another PhD student<br>Rebecca sharp actually looked uh to see<br>if this was correct and so we had a<br>essay that we do in the lab which is<br>what we call our Alp little a formation<br>essay where we simply take epoa uh in a<br>test tube and we add LDL and what we see<br>then is we get LP little a formed which<br>is a much bigger particle so it migrates<br>uh much more slowly on a gel system and<br>so we could get Alpa formed and when we<br>added in our peptide we saw with<br>increasing amounts of the peptide that<br>in fact we started to inhabit Alp delay<br>formation and Rebecca went on to develop<br>a whole series of these peptides and<br>including some that were more effective<br>than this one that inhibited Alpay<br>formation in the nanoma<br>range and then we had a really dumb<br>idea you see you occasionally have dumb<br>ideas<br>years and what I got quite excited about<br>this and I thought well well we can<br>block Alpa formation we can develop a<br>peptide drug that's going to block Alp<br>formation and lower Alpay and we're will<br>be<br>famous unfortunately that was not the<br>case so we did move into animal studies<br>with our most effective peptides but<br>turned out that the peptides when we<br>delivered them into the circulation of<br>animals had very short short half lives<br>so they didn't last very long in the<br>blood and they tended and that was<br>because they tended to Aggregate and so<br>we pretty much drew a bit of a blank<br>going into uh moving into animal studies<br>that happens sometimes but I had a<br>colleague actually say to me around the<br>time that this happened he said to me<br>well how do you know that this s<br>situation is better than this<br>situation and he was right because there<br>were some studies coming out in the<br>literature that actually showed that<br>epoa alone just the protein part alone<br>had some arthrogenic properties so maybe<br>inhibiting Alp was not such a good idea<br>moving<br>on so the second question that we wanted<br>to um answer about Alpa was what's its<br>function what does it do why do we have<br>it we did know a lot about how Alpa is<br>involved in developing heart disease we<br>knew that the LDL part was arthrogenic<br>it gets stuck in the arterial wall we<br>also knew that the foa protein<br>interferes with the breakdown of blood<br>clots so that is also um a bad thing<br>from a from a heart um point of view but<br>we didn't know its<br>function and so about 10 years ago there<br>was some studies starting to appear in<br>the<br>literature on uh the proteomics of<br>plasma lipo proteins now proteomics is<br>just a fancy word for protein makeup or<br>what proteins are on something and<br>there' been a couple of papers on LDL<br>and there had been a paper come out on<br>HDL and we thought to ourselves why<br>don't we apply proteomics to look at<br>what what proteins are on the Alp lay<br>particle cuz maybe that will give us a<br>hint about what it<br>does so um in my lab we had developed a<br>protocol for purifying the Alpay<br>particle from blood<br>and using that uh and combined with the<br>expertise of Anna vinski who was a<br>postto in my lab at the time and in<br>conjunction with toron Koffman who runs<br>the center for protein research uh in<br>our<br>department we took some isolated Alpa<br>and we looked to identify all of the<br>proteins that were contained on the<br>particle now you could be forgiven for<br>thinking that there's only two proteins<br>on LPA because there's only two proteins<br>shown here at a and app B but an actual<br>fact there's a whole lot of proteins<br>bound to this<br>particle and what Arna and torson found<br>was a whole lot of proteins about 35<br>different proteins some of these we<br>expected to be there because we knew<br>that some of the proteins would be the<br>same proteins that they' found in the<br>LDL proteomic studies and most of these<br>are Apper protein proteins which bind<br>lipids and we expected them to be there<br>but we also found some other unique<br>proteins which we weren't expecting we<br>found various forms of uh fibrinogen<br>which is the protein involved in blood<br>clots forming blood clots we found a<br>whole lot of proteins involved in the<br>immune<br>response and what Anna did was she took<br>all of these proteins and put them into<br>a computer program that groups the<br>proteins into their functional role and<br>when she did that we came up with two<br>major functional groups of proteins on<br>the alalay<br>particle one group was the proteins<br>involved in lipid transport which we<br>fully expected to be there because we<br>knew that they were on the LDL part of<br>the<br>molecule but there was a even bigger<br>group which clustered into a group of<br>proteins known as proteins involved in<br>response to wounding and these were<br>proteins involved in the immune response<br>and in the coagulation and the form<br>formation of blood clots you all know<br>that when you wound yourself what<br>happens is there's an immune response<br>white blood cells come in to heal the uh<br>wound and you have blood clots<br>forming and so if you were to predict<br>just based on the protein makeup of the<br>Alp molecule if you were to predict what<br>it does you would say well it's involved<br>in wound healing and what was really<br>really exciting to me was that 30 years<br>earlier in the nature Journal there had<br>been an article by Michael Brown and Joe<br>Goldstein who won the Nobel Prize in<br>1985 for working out the LDL uh uptake<br>pathway and they had written this<br>article about plasma lipoproteins and<br>there was quite a section on LP little a<br>and the big uh question was well why do<br>we have Alpa and what's its function and<br>this is what they predicted they<br>predicted that having a form of<br>cholesterol that binds to fibrinogen<br>might be of selective Advantage for<br>wound healing so it was really exciting<br>for me to see that 30 years later we had<br>using very high-end<br>Technologies um identified the proteins<br>on ala and when we put them all together<br>our prediction would be exactly that of<br>brown and Goldstein and that was quite<br>exciting for me to find that<br>so the proteomic study uh has given us<br>an insight into function we obviously<br>have to do a lot of a lot of experience<br>experiments now to prove that LP is<br>actually involved in wound healing but<br>knowing the protein makeup of LP has<br>given us a lot of information that we<br>can now do further work on in studying<br>these proteins and Torsten for example<br>and Anna are looking at the levels of<br>these proteins and people that had heart<br>disease versus people that don't have<br>heart disease so there's a lot of um<br>this this study has given us a lot of<br>information to to to lead us into<br>further<br>experiments so the last question how is<br>Alp taken up by cells this is work by<br>Monica Sharma who is a PhD student uh<br>still currently with me um and Monica<br>set up a system with uh cultured liver<br>cells so these are liver cells cultured<br>um and took purified Alp little<br>and incubated the liver cells with the<br>Alpay gave them a good wash and then<br>looked to see where the lp little a<br>ended up inside the<br>cell and we did this by visualizing the<br>lp a inside the cell using confocal<br>micros microscopy which is a technique<br>which basically cuts through a cell it<br>cuts through sections of a cell but like<br>having an MRI where they cut through<br>slice through through your body um where<br>we were slicing through a cell and we<br>were looking to see where the Alp lay<br>was this is one of the first experiments<br>that Monica did and we have a whole<br>range of markers that light up different<br>parts of the cell in this case we used a<br>marker that lights up the cell nucleus<br>so we can see see where the nucleus is<br>and we can visualize down the microscope<br>and see Alp coming into the cells our<br>Alpay molecule is stained green and you<br>can see it coming into the cell and<br>accumulating at 2 hours and then the<br>signal fading with time what we can also<br>do is crack open these cells and look at<br>the cell contents and actually probe for<br>the epoa protein which tags Alp a and<br>this is shown down here the Alp epoa<br>band tagging the Alpa is apparent after<br>1 hour of incubation and accumulated uh<br>to 2 hours so pretty much showing what<br>we were seeing in the down the<br>microscope and this can be Quantified so<br>Monica had set up a system to look at<br>Alp being taken up into<br>cells the next question was well what<br>receptor ism is responsible for taking<br>Alp into cells we knew it would be a<br>receptor mediated uptake of Alpa and we<br>had plenty of receptors to choose from<br>these are all receptors that have been U<br>reported as interacting with Alp little<br>a uh and we chose these three here the<br>LDL receptor the asyo glycoprotein<br>receptor and one of the plasminogen<br>receptors because we thought these were<br>the most likely receptors to be involved<br>they were expressed by liver cells and<br>there had been reports that they<br>Alp so we reasoned that if any of these<br>three receptors were responsible for<br>taking Alp into cells that we would find<br>them together with the Alp and inside<br>the<br>cell and so again looking down the<br>confocal microscope we had a stain<br>specifically for the asyo glycoprotein<br>receptor we had one also for the LDL<br>receptor and one for the plasminogen<br>receptor that we chose to work<br>with and here is our Alp stained<br>green so red plus green equals yellow<br>primary colors you'll remember that from<br>primary school and what we were looking<br>for was yellow we were looking to see if<br>these two things were colocalized the<br>alol and the<br>receptor and when you merge these two<br>images together you look for yellow we<br>didn't see much and this is the uh blown<br>up again here the merged image blown up<br>no yet not much yellow here not much<br>yellow here but down here you can see<br>quite a bit of yellow and that what that<br>was telling us was that it looks like<br>Alp is co-localized is found with this<br>particular receptor inside the<br>cell but we had to prove this further so<br>we were fortunate to be able to get hold<br>of some cells that were missing the<br>plasminogen receptor they had had this<br>receptor knocked<br>out and we looked to see how well these<br>knockout cells took up<br>Alpay so here's our cells um without any<br>Alpay added and we were looking we were<br>tagging the app away to see it coming<br>into the cells and this is incubated<br>with LP little a now the wild type or WT<br>that just stands for normal cells they<br>are normal cells with the receptor there<br>present and you can see them taking up<br>the alpar lay but when we us the cells<br>where this plasminogen receptor had been<br>knocked out we found that in fact there<br>was much less uptake of ala and this is<br>Quantified over here now we were quite<br>excited about this because no one had<br>shown that this receptor was involved in<br>lipo uptake and you can see there's<br>still a little bit of LP uptake still<br>here and Monica is still uh is currently<br>looking at two other um plasminogen<br>receptors the plasminogen receptor<br>family is quite large but there's a<br>couple of other receptors that we think<br>might be involved in this residual<br>uptake but then we wanted to know well<br>where does the L end up once it gets<br>inside the cell where does it go<br>and there's lots of places inside the<br>cell that things can go when they get<br>taken up we were expecting to find the<br>alul in a vesicle structure known as the<br>early endosome because most things that<br>get taken up by receptors end up in<br>early endosomes when they first come<br>into the<br>cell we thought the Alp could end up in<br>lomes which are basically bags of<br>enzymes that break things down so we<br>thought maybe we might find the Alp and<br>lomes another place we could find the<br>Alpa is in the uh an organal called the<br>GGI apparatus or the GGI and this is<br>just like a big processing plant inside<br>the cell it modifies things and sorts<br>things and usually sends them packing uh<br>out into secret secretory vesicles that<br>actually uh resecreted res secrete<br>things back out from the cells so using<br>the same techniques as I've just shown<br>you we had a whole lot of markers that<br>St all these different parts of the<br>cell and what we saw when we did our<br>staining technique is we found that the<br>Alpay was actually colocalized with<br>early endosomes this is a marker for<br>early endosomes and if you can look over<br>here you'll see quite a bit of yellow so<br>and we expected we expected to find the<br>alpan early<br>endes and then we looked to see if it<br>was in lome so we had a lome marker here<br>and again using the same<br>Technique we saw no yellow at all and we<br>decided Well they're not being broken<br>down by lomes which is a wee bit of a<br>surprise to us because LDL gets broken<br>down and<br>limes so then we took a look at the GOI<br>to see if we could find Alp in the<br>GGI and in fact within a couple of hours<br>we got very good colocalization of alp<br>in the GOI and we wondered what it was<br>doing there because the GGI um<br>often repackages things and sends them<br>out in secretory vesicles for things to<br>be resecreted outside the cell and we'd<br>never heard of apoa or Alp being<br>resecreted this was a novel<br>Finding we did one further<br>colocalization experiment and this was<br>tagging the vesicles known as recycling<br>endosomes which are the vesicles<br>involved in res secreting things back<br>outside the<br>cell and what we found was very very<br>good colocalization indicating that LPA<br>was looks looked like it was being uh<br>packaged into resec e<br>bical we also had another marker that<br>also tags recycling endosomes called<br>transferin which is a protein that<br>recycles ion and we found Alp in the<br>same location as transference so this<br>was really confirming that Alpay was<br>being packaged for resecretion<br>and the very last question that we had<br>to ask was what well is Alp actually<br>being resecreted outside of the cell so<br>Monica modified her experiments<br>slightly and instead of looking at the<br>CES at this point she left them in fresh<br>media and then took the media to see if<br>we could find Al out outside the cells<br>in the media and what she found was that<br>within two hours we actually saw the EPO<br>a coming out of the cells but it wasn't<br>fully formed Alp it was just the app<br>protein<br>part and that was quite a surprise to us<br>and what she further found was with time<br>it looked like the epoa reformed Alpa<br>outside the cell and that wasn't a<br>surprise to us because we knew that<br>these cells made LDL like particles and<br>we knew that if you put AOA into media<br>that contains LDL particles it would<br>actually form alp a and that was what we<br>were seeing so summarizing all of this<br>work uh in this<br>diagram we had found that Alpo gets<br>taken up by the plasminogen receptor<br>comes in on early<br>endes at some point the appoa part is<br>broken away from the particle now we<br>don't know exactly where that happens<br>but there is evidence for the disulfide<br>links that between proteins being<br>reduced in some of these compartments<br>either the early endosomes the GOI or<br>the recycling endosomes what we do know<br>is that the appoa part traffics through<br>into Recycling endosomes and is sput<br>back out by the cell and once outside<br>the cell it reforms<br>Alp and Monica has shown that the LDL<br>part actually does go to the lome by<br>labeling the lipid component so we had<br>basically uncovered the whole catabolic<br>pathway way for Al p and this um has<br>just recently resulted in Monica wonning<br>a number of Awards She's just arrived<br>back from the states actually where is<br>where are you Monica there you go H<br>where she uh presented this work at<br>three different conferences two in<br>Austria and one in the US and for every<br>presentation she was awarded a best<br>presentation award and I think that's a<br>huge um hugely successful um PhD<br>D so that's um where we are and we're<br>just about to submit this work so this<br>is very very recent work and we're just<br>about to submit for publishing now I<br>just want to finish up by talking a<br>little bit just a little bit about the<br>HDL research program that we've had<br>going HDL uh was discovered in<br>1929 it is the complete opposite of<br>Alpay in terms of heart disease it is<br>protective against heart<br>disease and we know this from many large<br>clinical trials that show low levels of<br>HDL are are a risk factor for heart<br>disease so completely opposite um<br>situation we know from transgenic animal<br>studies that if you make animals Express<br>high levels of HDL they are protected<br>against developing heart disease and we<br>know that HDL has a lot of um protective<br>properties there is a condition known as<br>Tanger disease where individuals<br>virtually don't have any HDL and they<br>develop early heart<br>disease now if you just focus on the<br>left part of the slide I just want to<br>mention one key Protein that's really<br>really important for HDL being formed<br>and that is a protein known as the abca1<br>cholesterol<br>transporter HDL starts Life as a very<br>lipid pore particle it gets secreted<br>from the liver cell with only a little<br>bit of protein and the protein on HDL is<br>that a protein called aa1 and it doesn't<br>have any cholesterol on it at all it<br>actually picks up cholesterol in<br>circulation by the action of this<br>transporter here the abca1 cholesterol<br>transporter which sits on the membranes<br>of all our cells it's very highly<br>expressed by the liver and this protein<br>basically puts cholesterol onto<br>HDL without the activity of this protein<br>you cannot make<br>HDL and and so just one slide about my<br>HDL research program and this was<br>performed by two uh very hardworking and<br>clever PhD students Brie senson and<br>Rachel<br>Satani we had identified a number of uh<br>people in the local population that had<br>really really low HDL cholesterol levels<br>this is was in conjunction with uh Greg<br>Jones and Michael<br>Williams and we'd found individuals that<br>had really low HD levels and when we<br>looked at the abca1 transported Gene and<br>this is a artist artistic um impression<br>of what abca1 might look like in the<br>membrane we found that these people had<br>lots had mutations they had mutations in<br>their abca1 Gene and and therefore their<br>protein and they were all over the<br>protein and what Rachel and Brie did was<br>they looked to see they investigated<br>these mutants to see why they were<br>causing low um HDL cholesterol in these<br>people and so we expressed all of these<br>well bre expressed all of these mutants<br>in cells and this is a green labeled<br>abca1 protein and this is the normal<br>protein and this is a stain for the<br>outside of the cell and you can see if<br>you do the colocalization the protein is<br>found on the outside of cells and this<br>is one of our<br>mutants what we actually found was<br>almost all of these mutants aggregated<br>inside the cell they never made it to<br>the outside of the cell and that would<br>be what and that is why they were<br>causing these people to have low HDL<br>cholesterol so now the grand<br>finale so all of these years these two<br>programs have been going on<br>independently side by side we never<br>thought there was a connection between<br>Alpay and<br>HDL but a few years ago we were studying<br>um some mice these were LP littlea<br>transgenic mice that we were working<br>with and we found that they had high HDL<br>levels much higher than their their<br>non-transgenic<br>lates and so we we wondered why Alp was<br>causing these animals to have high HDL<br>and at the same time there were a couple<br>of studies um done in some African<br>populations that showed there was a<br>positive correlation between Alpay and<br>HDL and we wondered why this was but we<br>knew we had the perfect system to look<br>at this so the system that Monica had<br>set up whereby we took liver cells and<br>incubated them with<br>Alp we then used to answer the question<br>whether there was a connection between<br>Alp and HDL and what we did was we took<br>ourselves incubated with them with Alp<br>and instead of looking at Alp uptake we<br>looked to see if Alp could affect the<br>activity and the expression of abca1<br>because abca1 one is the key protein<br>involved in HDL<br>formation and so what Monica saw was<br>that with increasing amounts of Alpa we<br>got increased expression of the abca1<br>Gene and that translated into increased<br>levels of the protein inside the cells<br>and<br>furthermore these cells showed that had<br>been incubated with Alpa showed<br>increased cholesterol e flux which is<br>the function of the abca1<br>protein this got us quite excited<br>because we thought wow there's a<br>connection Alp is upregulating HDL<br>formation and what was really<br>interesting was that there had been a<br>number of papers published showing that<br>the appoa part of the Alpa protein<br>actually bound oxidized phospholipids so<br>these are just oxidized forms of<br>lipids and furthermore it was known that<br>oxidized phospholipids upregulate abca1<br>that was well documented in the<br>literature<br>and it did so by the activity of these<br>two transcription factors here p and lxr<br>these two transcription factors are<br>upregulated by oxidized lipids and they<br>abca1 and so the last bit in the puzzle<br>to solve was well what receptor is<br>involved in taking up oxidized lipids<br>from the Alpay particle and we knew<br>there was only one receptor that could<br>to do that and that was this receptor<br>here the sb1 receptor which had been<br>Well published as taking up oxidized<br>lipids from lipoproteins it didn't take<br>the whole particle up only the oxidized<br>lipids and so we thought right let's see<br>if this receptor is involved in the<br>abca1 response we had an antibody that<br>blocked the sib1 receptor and when we<br>put that antibody onto ourselves we saw<br>that we completely blocked the ABC one<br>response that was promoted by Alpay so<br>here we have our Alp response and then<br>we can block that with the srb1 receptor<br>furthermore we showed but that blocking<br>whole Alp particle uptake so the pathway<br>that I've just been telling you about<br>previously had no effect so we were had<br>specifically showed that it was the<br>oxidized phospholipids which we knew<br>were carried on the lp particle were the<br>the key thing was promoting this abca1<br>response so bringing it all together in<br>a<br>diagram here we had shown that Alp delay<br>binds to the sb1 receptor and<br>fortunately for us there was a group in<br>the US that had literally just published<br>that the srb1 receptor binds to<br>Alpa and just the oxidized lipids that<br>are found on the Alp particle are<br>brought through through by the or<br>transferred by the srb1 receptor into<br>the cell where they activate these two<br>transcription factors which are known to<br>activate the abca1 Gene and that leads<br>to Greater expression and more abca1<br>protein on the plasma membrane and that<br>results in greater eflux and higher HDL<br>cholesterol levels and what was really<br>exciting was about 2 months ago there<br>was a paper published it was actually<br>just an abstract not a full paper it was<br>published in the journal uh of American<br>Cardiology uh College of<br>cardiologists and it was a study using a<br>data base of a million people where<br>they' measured the Alpa levels and they<br>measured the HDL levels and they<br>reported a positive correlation between<br>LPA and HDL and we think that we have<br>found why there's a there's a connection<br>because of this pathway<br>so this resulted in a really nice<br>publication for Monica and the journal<br>ofid research last year and in fact this<br>article was chosen for commentary in<br>that issue and uh and that's a really<br>exciting thing to have your paper chosen<br>out of a bunch of papers to be commented<br>on so I think I've um W wed you with<br>enough science tonight um but I want to<br>just finish up by acknowledging many<br>many people and so I've throughout my<br>talk I've used we it's the Royal Wei<br>because basically all of this work has<br>been done by my students and I'm very<br>very fortunate that I've had many many<br>hardworking really smart PhD<br>students um and there's too many to<br>mention I've just listed the ones whose<br>work I've presented tonight I've also<br>been blessed with having many many good<br>collaborators and I've listed a few that<br>have been important to me here Greg<br>Jones Michael Williams TOA and Anna for<br>the proteomics work Gregory redpath<br>who's helped Monica with her studies<br>and matth perini who helped us with the<br>early work on the peptides and I've also<br>been blessed to have two very um<br>fantastic research fellows helping out<br>with this research and Emma Cheesman who<br>was my very first research fellow and<br>Carolyn porus who is in the audience<br>tonight and last but not least I want to<br>also uh give my thanks to a number of<br>general staff in the biochemistry<br>Department they're too numerous to<br>mention but these are the ones that are<br>busy working away in the background<br>sorting the finances sorting the ad<br>Administration there's a couple of<br>people I just want to mention as Brahman<br>um sorry Brahman carile who actually<br>helped me get my slides pretty for<br>tonight so thank you Brahman um and and<br>also Mari cockel who is our key<br>equipments person who is always fixing<br>equipment and if without him and my<br>research program would have never um<br>been so thank you to Mario I know he's<br>not here tonight and last but not least<br>I have been forunate to have been um<br>supported by all of my past HS so Mur<br>Smith and I can see M tonight Warren<br>Tate he's also in the audience tonight<br>John cutfield and more recently Kurt KRA<br>they have given me a lot of Support over<br>the years and also thank you to<br>deputy<br>so thank you Sally for right thank you<br>Sally for um I think what everyone will<br>agree is a fabulous sort of tour through<br>her scientific career I just really want<br>to make a few comments um before I know<br>I'm in the way of um us and uh I think<br>more C celebration but I think Sally is<br>um has really taken us on a tour today<br>um starting in I think swin and then<br>going to Lincoln and then on to the USA<br>and then back to denan and I think the<br>one thing that is common through all of<br>her scientific life is her lipids and<br>her interest in uh I guess understanding<br>the lipoprotein component and their<br>roles in health and disease and I think<br>to me it's marvelous that there's this<br>connection right from her uh PhD right<br>the way through and I think it's a a I<br>think she's she I dare her to work on<br>something else I guess so um I think<br>that I think it's been very fruitful and<br>so a very productive um research career<br>uh and that we hope will go on to<br>continued success and I think the um<br>Sally has really shown us how applying a<br>range of different techniques to this<br>problem has really borne considerable<br>fruit and I think that's something we<br>should all remember in our research not<br>just to be stuck on one approach um but<br>it's really about she's use it uh I know<br>didn't talk about it but genetic<br>approach then a proteomics and then<br>really the careful biochemical<br>dissection of these molecules and has<br>been really very revealing and I think<br>allowed her to make considerable Insight<br>so I think that's a key thing about what<br>Sally has done I think the other thing<br>that we saw tonight very clearly was the<br>ability to build connections between<br>different aspects of her research and I<br>think that that's really what can lift<br>sometimes is to be prepared for the<br>unexpected and not sort of have a<br>fixated view about how things were and<br>so for these significant advances we<br>need to be prepared for the unexpected<br>and I think Sally has shown that tonight<br>very clearly how different aspects have<br>connected and she's really capitalized<br>on that so uh I think thank you Sally<br>for a great tour of your research and<br>just a couple of things even though I<br>know I was suppos us to talk about<br>research but I really just wanted to<br>comment that I think Sally really<br>embodies what we think of as an academic<br>uh with all of um her uh especially her<br>teaching contributions which I really<br>think are significant and she's made uh<br>a huge contribution to the department<br>and particularly ensuring that the next<br>generation of biochemists are very well<br>trained and prepared to go on and embark<br>on Research careers Sally is an<br>outstanding our teacher and Ambassador<br>for the department and I think you can<br>see tonight also that she really has<br>engaged with her students and they have<br>really been the backbone of her uh<br>productive team so I think that's a<br>great uh credit to Sally and all of the<br>uh students that have worked with her<br>and so really just really uh a couple of<br>other comments is firstly to thank um I<br>think MV Smith we should owe a thanks<br>because he had the wisdom to uh offer<br>Sally a position back in 1995 and<br>1996 and today I was uh looking through<br>the old records and uh seeing what was<br>said and I think that Sally was actually<br>very brave to come I think there was<br>some considerable when I was looking at<br>the correspondents first there was<br>warnings and some discussion that they<br>were very skeptical about the promotion<br>process at the time and so that was was<br>a a slightly blunt response to an<br>inquiry and then the I think today at<br>least we can be sure that the promotion<br>process has worked well and then there<br>was also a letter from the then Vice<br>Chancellor Graham Fogelberg and I think<br>um I won't I was going to read some<br>quotes from it but I I won't do that but<br>I think that he was really expecting<br>great things of Sally and said that she<br>had to be better than anyone in the<br>northern universities of New Zealand and<br>so um I that that that to be successful<br>she would really have to excel and it<br>was quite uh quite strong comments and I<br>think um Sally has done well and has<br>clearly excelled and came here bravely<br>into I think um a time when it was a<br>reasonably tough time so well done Sally<br>I think you have um well you have shared<br>with with us a great Insight tonight and<br>um I really want to thank Gib Sally my<br>personal thanks as the deputy H she's uh<br>can be relied upon always for an honest<br>opinion and also to mck in when's needed<br>so that she will come and help if need<br>be and is very willing to share her load<br>in the department so I think a great<br>colleague to have in the department so<br>thank you Sally so uh come over because<br>celebrations<br>my name is Peter krton I'm the pro Vice<br>Chancellor of Health Sciences and it's<br>my pleasure to bring our formalities<br>this evening to a close I would like to<br>say thank you to Sally for that that<br>consument performance and also to add my<br>thanks to her um for her very evident<br>commitment to exellence in all her<br>activities and that's come through very<br>strongly hasn't it and also thanks to<br>her team and her postgraduate students<br>who are here this evening thank you to<br>all of you look in closing and before I<br>invite us all to Refreshments I would<br>like to say a final thank you to uh<br>Sally's family who've come this evening<br>to support<br>I think you constitute about half the<br>audience this evening thank you so much<br>I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you<br>followed um that the gist of her story<br>so look thank you to everybody else<br>Sally's uh colleagues and uh supporters<br>and to members of the public who've been<br>here this evening thank you to all of<br>you so look that's the end this evening<br>and I invite everybody to join us for<br>Refreshments uh upstairs in the staff<br>club which is just around the corner go<br>past all the the works on the The<br>beautification Works find your way past<br>there and go into the staff club and go<br>upstairs thank you very much for coming<br>this<br>evening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
