But he does an excellent job of disproving that staid image of the profession through his own diverse body of research.<br><br>At his Inaugural Professorial Lecture, he spoke about a major theme of his research - non-financial, narrative reporting. This is how commercial and public organisations use annual reports to not only report on their financial performance to shareholders, but also as a public relations tool to present themselves in the best possible light and respond to media criticism.<br><br>For more information about our Inaugural Professorial Lecture Series please visit http://bit.ly/YYnOk2.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

Asian<br>accounting business and finance journal<br>and the Metar accountancy research it's<br>my real pleasure now to welcome grant<br>for his inaugural professorial lecture<br>thank you very<br>much<br>work<br>okay Deputy Vice Chancellor colleagues<br>and<br>family it is with a great<br>deal of trepidation that I present my<br>inaugural<br>lecture While others who have graced<br>podiums such as this have acknowledged<br>their career<br>successes every now and again it is<br>useful to acknowledge and indeed reflect<br>on a career built on failure mistakes<br>and<br>accidents my school results were without<br>any Merit<br>whatsoever I barely obtained a<br>university entrance pass law was the<br>only faculty that would accept me as a<br>student my first couple of years at<br>University are worthy of mention not by<br>the grades I achieved but rather the<br>classes I was absent from the<br>assignments I did not complete and the<br>exams I did not sit<br>now to many of you particularly in the<br>era of student loans this would seem to<br>be a waste of time and money but I had<br>carefully rationalized my<br>position as my school friends were<br>undertaking two years of compulsory<br>military service in the South African<br>Defense Force I felt that I had a window<br>of opportunity to participate in a<br>variety of extracurricular activities I<br>had not been exposed to by virtue of my<br>attendance at an or male boarding<br>school<br>unfortunately not all those in my<br>immediate circle saw it this way after<br>my rather dismal first year results I<br>received the following ultimatum from my<br>father get a haircut and get a<br>job this was indeed a<br>shock it was not an activity I took to<br>with a great deal of<br>enthusiasm my search took me to the<br>classified section of the newspaper<br>where I found an advertisement for an<br>article<br>clock<br>now you would think that one would try<br>and find out what an article Clark was<br>before setting out for an<br>interview this was perhaps my first<br>mistake I<br>didn't I had an interview and was<br>offered employment I was given some<br>green forms to<br>sign and as I was still not old enough<br>to enter into a contract without<br>parental assistance one of my parents<br>needed to coign the<br>documents and this is perhaps where I<br>made the second mistake I did read the<br>forms my father however signed them<br>immediately I had effectively indentured<br>myself for 5 years as an article clerk<br>with my salary for the period of the<br>contract clearly<br>detailed as part of this contract I had<br>to work full-time while studying<br>part-time so becoming an accountant was<br>circumstances my first day at work as a<br>training member of the accounting<br>profession was memorable for for all the<br>wrong reasons I did not possess a suit<br>so arrived at work was splendent in my<br>school Blazer and a<br>tie my first audit engagement took me<br>took place on day one I was delivered to<br>a client by the partner in charge to<br>undertake an attorney's trust account<br>audit the words attorney audit and trust<br>account could have been ancient fary as<br>far as I was<br>concerned let's revisit what we have<br>here a failed lawyer well failed first<br>year law anyway someone with dismal<br>School Leaving results and more<br>importantly had not studed accounting at<br>school and someone not yet old enough to<br>enter into a contract without parental<br>assistance about to embark on a an<br>attorney's trust account<br>audit I was given the audit file and if<br>my memory serves me correctly the<br>following instructions Grant start with<br>the bank reconciliation and follow what<br>was done last year I was then<br>abandoned but of course there was a<br>practical problem as I had never had a<br>bank account I did not know what a bank<br>reconciliation<br>was after sitting staring at the<br>previous year's working paper files for<br>a couple of hours the lady responsible<br>for the trust accounts took pity in me<br>and showed me what to do including how<br>to sample files for audit and which<br>files to select how to make the<br>appropriate check marks in the files and<br>how to complete the audit program as<br>evidence of the work I had done<br>brilliant I hear you say you are indeed<br>fortunate to get this uh on the job<br>training for an experienced accountant<br>and for many of you this may not<br>necessarily appear<br>problematic however the purpose of an<br>attorney's trust account audit is to<br>ensure that attorneys do not use the<br>money entrusted to them by their clients<br>as a private or personal source of funds<br>as the South South African Institute to<br>char of accountants explained shortly<br>after I commenced My article then the<br>Temptation for misappropriation fraud<br>and theft makes attorney's trust<br>accounts a lucrative<br>Target okay so perhaps my first audit<br>experience was not the best possible of<br>example of on the job<br>training after completing articles and<br>eventually qualifying as a charted<br>accountant I held a number of accounting<br>positions before a friend asked me to<br>consider joining the University of Nal<br>in Durban this is where the title of<br>this address comes from the articles of<br>clerkship document I signed was green<br>also in the pre-computer era accounting<br>and audit working papers were completed<br>by hand in the case of the firm where I<br>worked we used green multicolumn paper<br>audit check marks were made in green ink<br>3 years into my articles The Firm<br>celebrated how Progressive they were by<br>moving to blue multicolumn paper and and<br>audit check marks made in purple ink by<br>leaving the accounting and auditing<br>profession I had now moved beyond the<br>green and<br>purple I was not at the University of<br>natal long before I was approached to<br>join the University of Durban Westville<br>so in some ways becoming an academic<br>followed much the same unplanned path as<br>becoming an<br>accountant my research agenda has<br>introduced me to some Fascinating People<br>now for a number of you the words<br>accountant and F ating do not belong in<br>the same sentence in fact they probably<br>should not belong in the same<br>dictionary the reason for this is that<br>there's a stereotypical view of<br>accountants as dull and uninteresting<br>this perception has been reinforced by<br>popular culture such as the following<br>C oh Mr an do sit down thank you take<br>the weight off the feet eh yes lovely<br>for the time of year must s enough of<br>this gay banter and now Mr Ang are you<br>asked us to advise you which job in life<br>you were best suited for that is correct<br>yes well I now have the results here of<br>the interviews and the aptitude tests<br>that you took last week and from them<br>we've built up a pretty clear picture<br>the sort of person that you are and I<br>think I can say without fear of<br>contradiction that the ideal job for you<br>is charted<br>accountancy but I am a chartered<br>accountant prob good well back to the<br>office with you then<br>no no no you don't understand I've been<br>a chart cter for the last 20 years I<br>want a new job something exciting that<br>will let me Live Well Char of count is<br>rather exciting isn't it exciting no<br>it's not it's D D D my God it's dull<br>it's so desperately dull and tedious and<br>stuffy and boring and desperately D well<br>uh yes Mr an but you see you're report<br>here says that you are an extremely dull<br>person you see our experts describe you<br>as an appallingly dull fellow<br>unimaginative timid lacking in<br>initiative spineless easily dominated no<br>sense of humor tedious company and<br>irrepressibly drab and awful and uh<br>whereas in most professions these would<br>be considerable drawbacks in charted<br>accountancy they're a positive<br>boom don't you see I came here to find a<br>new job a new life a new meaning to my<br>existence can't you help me well do you<br>have any idea of what you want to do yes<br>taming<br>yes where accountants are portrayed in<br>films they are often depicted as<br>villains or Rogues for example in the<br>film The Producers accountant Leo bloom<br>comes up with the brilliant scheme to<br>builk money from investors in a show<br>that is guaranteed to be a<br>flop in the sh Shank Redemption<br>accountant and convicted murderer Andy<br>Andy manages to avoid being assaulted by<br>other inmates by completing the prison<br>guard's tax returns he also uses his<br>accounting knowledge to help the<br>prisoner uh prison Governor hide money<br>off the<br>books the re recent release of the film<br>the accountant was a cause for<br>celebration by our<br>profession the yat and Bay of Plenty<br>branches of the Institute of Chartered<br>Accountants Australia and New Zealand<br>considered this belated recognition of<br>our profession to be so momentous that<br>they offered private screenings to<br>members behind the cover of an<br>accounting office the main character<br>Christian wolf works as a freelance<br>accountant for some of the world's most<br>dangerous criminal organizations he is<br>also skilled in murder in Mayhem<br>personally I'm not so sure that this is<br>the best example of an accountant that<br>the two local branches of the Institute<br>with my accounting research provides me<br>with the opportunity to dispel a myth of<br>accountants as dull and<br>uninteresting I try to focus on<br>characters that may not necessarily be<br>traditional accountants but who are<br>colorful and exude a sense of<br>adventure perhaps my focus comes from<br>the games of my Early Childhood that in<br>the current environment would be<br>considered inappropriate coupled with my<br>consumption of boy own adventure<br>novels there is a there is of course an<br>alternative explanation that you may<br>wish to consider drawing on the video<br>You could argue that as an accountant I<br>am dull tedious uninspiring spineless<br>lacking initiative stuffy and boring and<br>so can only live vicariously through the<br>exploits of<br>others let me introduce you to some of<br>the people I've<br>known John Pringle was the focus of the<br>of Trader saor spy the case of John<br>Pringle and the transfer of accounting<br>technology to the Cape of Good<br>Hope this article is a micro history<br>where archival material supplemented<br>with existing literature is used to tell<br>a story that provides insights into<br>individuals and the little nuggets of<br>History John Pringle was the<br>illegitimate son of John Pringle who<br>represented sh s Kirkshire as a member<br>of<br>parliament he obtained a commercial<br>education in arithmetic and bookkeeping<br>from the William uh Reverend William<br>Rutherford before joining the East India<br>Company as a writer in 1793 and at the<br>age of 24 he was appointed agent the<br>Cape of Good Hope by the East India<br>Company secret committee this<br>appointment was facilitated by Henry<br>dundis who at the time was Secretary of<br>State of war in the British government<br>as well as president of the board of<br>control of the East India<br>Company part of pringle's job<br>description was to collect Military<br>Intelligence on French naval activities<br>in the Indian Ocean as well as political<br>commercial and Botanical<br>information effectively he was a spy for<br>the East India Company and indirectly<br>through Henry dundis to the British<br>government when Pringle realized that<br>the plans for an ex Expedition against<br>Marius was unlikely to take place he<br>left the cape for Cina he was not there<br>long before he received news that the<br>Dutch were likely to enter the war<br>against<br>England he immediately formulated plans<br>for invading the cape with the calina<br>Garrison he justified his decision as<br>follows if something is<br>not immediately immediately done the<br>French at Marius and the Dutch at the<br>cape will join and become most dangerous<br>enemies to our possessions in the East<br>this is a brilliant boy own adventure of<br>a 24-year-old working for a major<br>commercial organization prepared to plan<br>and participate in an invasion of a<br>colony of a sovereign state so why is<br>this important from an accounting<br>perspective from the second half of the<br>17th century the East India Company had<br>been relatively uninhibited when<br>transferring accounting a soft<br>technology to the factories in India and<br>elsewhere however there were significant<br>non-technical factors that needed to be<br>overcome in transferring accounting<br>technology to the Cape of good hope not<br>least war with France the use of micro<br>history in The Narrative of John Pringle<br>provides some insights into the<br>difficulties faced by an individual and<br>their interaction with others<br>particularly<br>superiors within an organization when<br>transferring accounting technology<br>something that would not read readily be<br>discernible from the examination of<br>Company the second individual I will<br>introduce you to is Lieutenant Colonel<br>Edward<br>Nichols from his orbitary in the times<br>dated 9th of February 1865 why would he<br>hero I like the fact he can kill the<br>combat what my co-author Gran Francis<br>and I set out to do in the art in the<br>article accounting artifacts as a means<br>of augmenting knowledge of the past the<br>case of Chief Hillis Hado and Lieutenant<br>Colonel Edward Nichols was to<br>demonstrate how an accounting artifact<br>from the British colonial era can be<br>used to augment knowledge of the<br>past what concerned us were the nature<br>of the conflicting secondary sources<br>surrounding presence given to the Native<br>American chief for his assistance to the<br>British particularly Nichols in the War<br>of 1812 this was was the war being<br>fought in America and should not be<br>confused with the war against Napoleon<br>that was occurring concurrently in<br>Europe the account in the Niles weekly<br>register of 1817 reports Hillis Hado<br>being introduced to the prince Regent<br>while dressed in the most splended suit<br>of red and gold and by his side he wore<br>Tomah hook mounted in gold in his<br>biography Jackson later president of the<br>United States inflates the number of<br>presents received to include a gold<br>mounted Tomahawk a diamond snuff box and<br>a su sum of money the number of her pres<br>increases with each telling to also<br>include £500 in gold jewels for his<br>daughter as well as handsome presence of<br>dresses shoes and bonnets and much<br>unaccustomed<br>finery so in the case of uncertainty<br>what do we do we go back to the original<br>archives we essentially undertook an<br>audit to uncover the truth and<br>understand the artifact through the haze<br>of 200 years of<br>propaganda our investigation found that<br>Hillis Hado Joe received two presents in<br>addition to those shown in the artifact<br>they were a brace of pistols and an<br>ornamental pipe Hatchet academic<br>references to his hatred of the white<br>man and his refusal to we wear white<br>man's clothing is inconsistent with the<br>description of the western clothing<br>detailed in the artifact as being<br>provided to him by<br>Nichols the artifact also provides us<br>with evidence of how the containment of<br>indigenous people occurred that is how<br>colonial governments provided indigenous<br>people with presence as a form of man<br>manipulation designed to encourage<br>certain actions in this case farming<br>rather than than engaging an armed<br>Military my work on the Reverend John<br>Clay is what I term opportun<br>opportunistic research in that it came<br>about as a result of work into my family<br>history as you can see from the<br>photographs the family resemblances in<br>indeed<br>remarkable John clay was considered to<br>be a very dull child his son described<br>him as amiable tractable but apparently<br>hopelessly inert drawing on the video<br>clip played earlier John clay possessed<br>the perfect personality to be an<br>accountant his initial schooling was at<br>the private Academy run by Mr Wy where<br>he received the commercial education<br>with a thorough training and accounts<br>however his schooling was considered<br>deficient in that it contained uh a SM a<br>no Greek only the rudiments of Latin and<br>a smattering of<br>French however what makes John clay a<br>true accounting hero was a stand against<br>the scourge of burial clubs that existed<br>in Lancashire and surrounding countries<br>counties during the first half of the<br>19th century in an 1853 letter to<br>William Brown MP for South Lancashire he<br>set out his concerns with the intended<br>consequences of poorly thought out and<br>drafted legislation in the form of the<br>friendly societies act 9th and 10th<br>Victoria although not a TR traditional<br>accounting document it is John Clay's<br>account of the inadequacy of the<br>legislation he argues that a financial<br>incentive remained for parents to commit<br>infanticide arsenic sulfuric acid and<br>neglect were the tools used by<br>parents evidence of a single child being<br>registered in up to 19 burial clubs as<br>well as hired nurses speculating on the<br>lives of infants committed to their care<br>were also<br>highlighted what I set out to do in the<br>paper the experienced chaplain of the<br>jail was to understand the letter as<br>well as the annual reports of the<br>Preston House of Correction for the<br>period 1824 to 1858 prepared by John<br>clay in the context of accounting<br>documents what I found is that these<br>annual reports can be can perhaps be<br>viewed as a precursor to a modern<br>organization's non-financial or<br>narrative<br>reporting over the last three decades<br>the accounting profession has not<br>covered itself with Glory the print<br>media in particular has correctly<br>highlighted the shortcomings of our<br>profession as can be evidenced by the<br>following few media<br>headlines in the number of the stories<br>the reporters make it clear that the big<br>four Global accounting firms are the<br>masterminds behind multinational tax<br>avoidance schemes which cost governments<br>and their taxpayers an estimated 1<br>trillion US dollars a year they are not<br>view this brings me to the final person<br>premer accountants are not usually seen<br>as activists a possible reason for this<br>is that as a discipline accounting is<br>inherently<br>conservative words such as conservative<br>conservatism and Prudence permeate our<br>vocabulary although a number of<br>prominent academics have acknowledged<br>the important role activism can play in<br>creating a more caring and Progressive<br>Society little incentive currently<br>exists for us to engage in this<br>activity any activism that does occur is<br>sporadic intermediate intermittent and<br>shortlived for many individuals Prem<br>Seca is accounting's moral compass<br>within the accounting Community SE is<br>arguably unique in that he is the most<br>prolific and longlived accounting<br>academic to engage in the genre of work<br>described as academic<br>activism what I set out to do in my<br>paper engagement with the third space<br>was to use Baba's conceptualization of<br>third space and postcolonialism to<br>understand se's use of the print and<br>electronic media to bridge the academic<br>activist<br>binary while the concepts of colonizer<br>colonized and colonizer have<br>traditionally be seen as a relationship<br>between the developed Western World and<br>undeveloped World it can apply equally<br>to the modern global economic and<br>political environment where one economy<br>or organization views itself as advanced<br>and developed and the other as failing<br>marginal and<br>backward through the use of electronic<br>media and blogs SE has moved Beyond The<br>Academy he has set out to mobilize<br>transform transformative action and<br>Forge alliances and has attempted to<br>create the possibility for fermenting<br>emancipatory change famed in uh framed<br>in terms of social justice and Equity he<br>uses his work as an academic accountant<br>to challenge the dominant path<br>structures and global economic systems<br>including the colonizing activities of<br>professional accounting firms regulatory<br>corporations while my teaching focuses<br>on the technical financial statements<br>portion of the annual report it is the<br>non-financial or narrative components<br>that in my view provide the most<br>interesting insight into<br>organizations as documents annual<br>reports have become increasingly<br>sophisticated creative and range in<br>Pages Cutting Edge print techniques text<br>visual images including stop motion<br>animation photographs abstract artwork<br>figures and graphs coupled with the Bold<br>use of color is used to supplement and<br>enhance the traditionally legal legally<br>data some of my research into narrative<br>reporting has focused on how two New<br>Zealand organizations the department of<br>conservation and the New Zealand Police<br>have used their annual report narratives<br>to respond to negative portrayal or<br>criticisms of them particularly by the<br>print<br>media in the article accountability<br>narrative reporting and legitimation the<br>case of a New Zealand Public benefit<br>entity my co-author anak kider and I<br>examined how the Department of<br>Conservation utilized informal reporting<br>disclosures in addition in addition to<br>formal accountability mechanisms to<br>pursue organizational<br>legitimacy we use five controversial<br>issues to illustrate how Doc used<br>impression management te techniques in<br>the annual report narratives to gain and<br>repair organizational<br>legitimacy these were the konoa Wild<br>Horse cull the Cave Creek disaster the<br>use of 1080 poison the conservation of<br>protected species and High Country<br>pastural<br>stations in response to Media criticism<br>criticism of the Kam Wild Horse C doc<br>made use of reactive legitimation<br>strategies to educ educate and inform<br>stakeholders that its actions to protect<br>and Restore New Zealand's natural<br>heritage were the most appropriate<br>available assertive impression<br>management techniques were used to focus<br>on the pos positive conservation<br>outcomes to the central North iseland<br>Tusk country from reduced horse herd<br>numbers The Cave Creek disaster of the<br>28th of April 1995 was a crisis of<br>legitimacy a reactive legitimation<br>strategy was used in the 1995 and 1996<br>six annual reports to educate and inform<br>stakeholders about the organizational<br>changes that had taken place and the<br>controls implemented to ensure that a<br>similar event would not<br>reoccur defensive impression management<br>techniques including the use of<br>apologies justifications and<br>explanations of why the event occurred<br>and expression of remorse were also used<br>legitimacy doc makes use of 1080 poison<br>to control pests particular possums in<br>response to early criticisms of its use<br>a reactive legitimation strategy was<br>used to educate and inform stakeholders<br>of Doc's dependency on the<br>poison continued failure to gain<br>stakeholder acceptance for the use of<br>1080 saw doc adopt a proactive<br>legitimation strategy in later annual<br>reports while continue to continuing to<br>use education campaigns public meetings<br>and results monitoring in in an effort<br>to obtain acceptance from stakeholders<br>for validity as<br>practitioners photographs showing 1080<br>being used were also included in the<br>annual report to illustrate the<br>appropriateness of this form of pest<br>control particularly in remote and<br>rugged Forest<br>blocks photographs of humans handling<br>the poison were used to convince<br>stakeholders of the relatively low risk<br>use in response to criticisms of its<br>ability to protect endangered species<br>proactive legitimation strategies were<br>used emotive symbols or photogra or<br>photographs of conservation icons in the<br>natural environment were used to deflect<br>attension away from Doc's inability to<br>Pro protect flora and<br>Extinction self-enhancement was used to<br>change stakeholder perception of Doc's<br>performance as an irresponsible land<br>owner and<br>manager to maintain legitimacy for its<br>control over the High Country pastoral<br>stations transferred to its management<br>from the tenure review process doc made<br>use of a case study coupled with<br>photographs to emphasize the important<br>role MSW station would play in future<br>conservation<br>efforts in a liberal democracy the<br>concept of police legitimacy is widely<br>recognized and accepted what this means<br>is that the performance or behavior of<br>individuals in organizations such as the<br>New Zealand Police whose claims to<br>legitimacy are based on a high level of<br>trust must be able to stand<br>scrutiny in the article repairing<br>organizational legitimacy the case of<br>the New Zealand Police co-authored with<br>Cliff Allen and Kristen Wallace We<br>examined three events that resulted in<br>what we term a crisis of confidence in<br>the New Zealand Police these were the<br>Steven Wallace shooting allegations of<br>aser we found that the New Zealand<br>Police made good use of image repair<br>discourse strategies in the immediate<br>aftermath of the Steven Waller shooting<br>photographs in the 2,000 annual report<br>show male police officers in a variety<br>of community uh related<br>roles for example there's a photograph<br>of the police commissioner attending a<br>poery at a<br>marai a police officer investing a home<br>Breakin while another shows a police<br>officer talking to a farmer these<br>photographs are an attempt to shift the<br>disc discourse of the New Zealand Police<br>from a brutal and racist Police Service<br>to one that is Humane and Equitable and<br>society in the aftermath of the claims<br>of sexual misconduct made against<br>assistant commissioner Clint rard and<br>two former policemen and the attempted<br>cover up of an in inadequate<br>investigation into P pack rap<br>allegations clever use was made of two<br>particular photographs in the 2005<br>annual<br>reports the first is a full shot face<br>shot of a policeman looking to the left<br>he is wearing the police uniform of<br>dress cap and shirt with epolets and tie<br>there is no caption and the image is<br>unremarkable in that the policeman could<br>represent every man his face is Pleasant<br>he is clean shaven and his gazed the<br>non-confrontational the second<br>photograph is that of a policewoman<br>again there is no caption but her<br>uniform matches that of a male<br>counterpart she is photographed outside<br>sitting or leaning against the wooden<br>bench looking at the camera with a<br>cheerful<br>smile at a quotative level the<br>represented representation of a<br>policeman as being normal a father son<br>brother can be contrast Ed with the<br>image of Clint Rickard that was<br>circulating During the<br>period Rickards was a large and<br>physically powerful man with a shaved<br>head and he heavily tattooed<br>forearms taken together with the first<br>image the second image of the police<br>woman Works to position both police<br>equals with the arena Asher case the New<br>Zealand Police used the combination of<br>image rep uh repair discourse strategies<br>in the annual report narratives to evade<br>responsibility while at the same time<br>detailing the corrective action taken by<br>the<br>organization I believe that<br>organizations will increasingly focus on<br>biodiversity and natural Capital related<br>reporting it will therefore be necessary<br>to develop tools that are able to Prov<br>that are able to provide insights into<br>the extent nature and changing levels of<br>corporate natural Capital disclosures<br>in our article developing a reporting<br>and evaluation framework biodiversity my<br>co-authors anakah Schneider and Daniel<br>tapen had three clear<br>objectives the first was to develop a<br>novel framework for biodiversity<br>reporting we drew on the Strategic and<br>Performance Management literature to<br>develop a broad framework comprising<br>three primary and 13<br>subcategories the second was an<br>application was the application of the<br>framework to an organization to analyze<br>the changes in the nature and level of<br>biodiversity related disclosures over<br>time the Exemplar organization we<br>selected was the New Zealand Department<br>of<br>Conservation we wanted to understand<br>whether changes in biodiversity related<br>disclosures mean that organizations<br>whose operations impact biodiversity<br>appreciate its importance what we<br>envisaged was that through developing<br>the framework intra entity and Inter<br>entity comparisons of biodiversity<br>reporting practices could be made<br>finally we set out to establish the<br>extent to which the disclosures made by<br>the Exemplar organization reflect the<br>eight platforms of deep ecology we<br>believe that this would provide a useful<br>structure through which the which<br>insights into the tension between<br>conservationists and those wishing to<br>use develop and exploit the conservation<br>estate could be<br>obtained there are a number of important<br>implications for organizations arising<br>from the study first it provides a<br>struct a structured approach to<br>presenting and analyzing narrative<br>biodiversity<br>disclosures it provides a means to which<br>biodiversity disclosures can be analyzed<br>and compared it provides an initial<br>framework that could be developed<br>further refined and<br>adapted while the application of the<br>eight platforms of deep ecology to<br>corporates is potentially problematic it<br>represents the starting point for a<br>deeper level of Engagement with<br>biodiversity<br>issues<br>while the Deep ecological principles<br>that guide human thought and actions<br>towards a more harmonious coexistent<br>with nature are particularly relevant to<br>conservation departments they are<br>arguably equally applicable to<br>corporations whose operations impact<br>biodiversity although it is unrealistic<br>to expect to expect organizations to<br>adhere to all eight platforms of deep<br>ecology the majority of the platforms<br>contain achievable objectives that<br>profit-seeking entities can aspire<br>to<br>the final part of my lure lecture looks<br>at where we are going I will maintain an<br>ongoing relationship with some of the<br>individuals I've got to know through my<br>research for example one of my current<br>projects is examining the accounting<br>budgets by prepared by Lieutenant<br>Colonel Edward Nichols for one who is<br>grandees col colonizing schemes and the<br>reasons behind its<br>failure integrated reporting and Global<br>reporting initiatives means a<br>requirements<br>means that corporates and other<br>reporting entities will place an<br>increasing emphasis on how their<br>operations impact impact the various the<br>various elements of natural Capital to<br>this end the funding that my colleagues<br>from the W management school and I have<br>received from the University means that<br>the work on the development of a natural<br>Capital reporting framework can<br>continue I do not believe that we fully<br>understand the reasons for the decisions<br>managers take when they prepare annual<br>report and non-financial accounting<br>narratives one of the reasons for this<br>is that the vehicles through which<br>corporate narratives are disseminated<br>continue to change and now include<br>websites and social media Platforms in<br>addition to the in addition to the<br>traditional print format Additionally<br>the forms that accounting narratives<br>take are<br>evolving finally as I suggested earlier<br>in the lecture as a profession we have<br>been sub we have been the subject of<br>valid criticisms from number of<br>quarters while as a profession we focus<br>on the words such as transparency and<br>the development of accounting<br>standards intended to provide<br>transparent financial reporting the<br>profession itself is far from<br>transparent and fails to consider their<br>public interest role internationally the<br>big four accounting firms have been<br>complicit in transfer pricing and tax<br>avoidance strategies aimed at minimizing<br>the tax paid by their clients both in<br>the countries they are domiciled in but<br>more importantly in developing<br>countries how the Prof how the modern<br>accounting profession operates will<br>require extensive research obtaining<br>access to the profession and Senior<br>players in particular from the big four<br>accounting firms will require caution<br>creativity and initiative in addition<br>the accounting profession will need to<br>acknowledge the public interest role<br>they play and accept the need to become<br>more open and<br>transparent I appreciate having been<br>provided with this opportunity to make<br>the presentation this evening and share<br>a bit of who I am and what I do with you<br>thank<br>you I'm Deborah Willis I'm the acting<br>dean of the W management school and it's<br>my pleasure to thank Professor samin for<br>his lecture<br>these lectures provide an opportunity<br>for newly appointed professors to share<br>that insights from their current<br>research and in this particular case<br>Professor samin provided a broad context<br>for the development of accounting<br>framework all academic research relates<br>to a search for truth and the asking of<br>critical and challenging questions and<br>this was certainly applied throughout<br>the lecture in the context of of Grant's<br>research it's very easy to cling to<br>stereotypes whether they relate to<br>National or ethnic characteristics or to<br>members of a profession and as we saw<br>today accountants are not immune to the<br>application of stereotypes and I I have<br>to admit that my image of accountants is<br>certainly inconsistent with the<br>historical examples that um were shared<br>with us tonight the lecture shows the<br>impact of historical context on the<br>activities of a particular profession<br>and of relevance today is the central<br>place of professional ethics and<br>certification by accreditation bodies<br>nevertheless it in this apparently<br>neutral sphere of the um narrative<br>annual report and the involvement of<br>accountants in Enterprises that can be<br>best described as<br>questionable I think this contributes um<br>or has done in the past to some<br>skepticism about claims about corporate<br>behavior and in the case of the lecture<br>the way in which information was<br>presented uh by government<br>agencies the accounting framework that<br>Grant has been working on has the<br>potential to increase the level of<br>transparency into explicitly Focus<br>stakeholders on ensuring that the<br>organizations that they are<br>participating in or they're they're a<br>part of their Community operate<br>sustainably and act in the best interest<br>of that community so thank you all very<br>much for coming please join me in<br>thanking Professor samin one more time<br>outside thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
