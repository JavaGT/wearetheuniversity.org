0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so good evening everybody my name is<br>Himanshu Wadhwa and I'm a medical<br>student at the Department of<br>Ophthalmology doing some research there<br>and Grafton campus and it's my pleasure<br>to be able to share my research review<br>today as I told investigating the use of<br>corneal stem cell enriched spheres and<br>kureta conic tissue repair<br>so before I start I'd just like to thank<br>the exposure committee and judges and<br>everybody for coming and for giving me<br>this chance to present my research so<br>first of all I would like to start with<br>some background so what is keratoconus<br>so Coretta Cronus is a disease that<br>affects the cornea which was the front<br>part of the eye indicated in white is<br>the cornea and as we can see in the<br>image on the left the kureta conic<br>cornea is almost forming a cone shape<br>compared with the more spherical shape<br>of the normal cornea and the image on<br>the right the word credit CONUS kureta<br>comes from cornea and CONUS of course<br>cone so how does it affect people so<br>people who are diagnosed with credit<br>CONUS are often young adults aged in<br>their 20s and 30s and this can cause<br>vision loss and severe cases and in<br>those cases what we do is we treat them<br>with corneal transplants so we cut out<br>the weak diseased cornea and replace it<br>with a healthy donor from a healthy<br>cornea from a human donor and this comes<br>with its own risks and resource<br>constraints in New Zealand credit CONUS<br>is the number one indication of corneal<br>transplants and New Zealand has one of<br>the highest prevalence rates of kureta<br>CONUS in the world it predominantly<br>so why does it happen so normally the<br>corneal cells the Creta sites produce<br>matrix which is the scaffold that holds<br>these cells together and the credit and<br>the matrix influences the corneal cells<br>but for complex reasons not completely<br>understood and Coretta Cronus<br>the corneal cells die and there's also a<br>loss of matrix so what we thought is<br>what if we could replace the lost cells<br>and so this is what my research is about<br>so we first of all we took stem cells<br>which live in the limbo area which is<br>the area between the clear cornea and<br>the white sclera indicated by the right<br>the red line and we made spheres so stem<br>cells are a very special type of cells<br>these limbo stem cells are adult stem<br>cells which normally become the other<br>eye cells and what's special about them<br>is that they normally repair anything<br>that damages the cornea so let's say a<br>child scratched the front of the cornea<br>this would these cells would go and<br>repair the cornea so we generated<br>spheres and as we can see this is a well<br>of spheres and the little white speckles<br>here are the spheres now if you're<br>wondering why you can't see them don't<br>worry it's because they're really small<br>and it's really hard to see with the<br>naked eye so what I've done is I've<br>magnified them for you and these brown<br>circles are the stem cell enriched<br>spheres so what we do is we took Coretta<br>conic corneas from donors and we<br>implanted them with our spheres and<br>these are the things we assist so do the<br>cells survive so there's no point in<br>planting spheres if they don't survive<br>do they migrate we'd like to see the<br>cells spread out do the cells divide so<br>this is quite important in the<br>sustainability of using spheres as<br>potential treatments for credit guns and<br>finally do the cells differentiate so do<br>they become more specialized do they<br>become wound healing cells do they<br>become cells that produce matrix what<br>type of cells do they become and this is<br>what we saw so this is a credit conic<br>cornea from a human donor and it's about<br>eight millimeters in diameter and what<br>we can see is that there's three spheres<br>implanted one two three and this image<br>the green indicates the living cells and<br>what this image tells us<br>three things a that the spheres can<br>survive in credit contact issue they can<br>adhere and credit conduct issue and they<br>begin migrating and what I'm about to<br>show you illustrate that impressive<br>migratory potential of spheres so just<br>three spheres and at ten days we can see<br>that the cells have continued to migrate<br>even further so they're beginning to<br>repopulate the disease credit conic<br>cornea and what's interesting is that we<br>also notice that the spheres can<br>communicate with each other when they're<br>placed near to each other so see here<br>how the cells are forming a cellular<br>bridge so that's indicated between the<br>white errors but more interesting than<br>this is whether the increased number of<br>cells that we see is only due to cell<br>migration or are cells dividing as well<br>so remember that is important for the<br>sustainability of using stem cells fears<br>as potential treatments and so to check<br>this what we did is we stained ourselves<br>with a special dye which causes cells to<br>light up red when they're dividing and<br>so as we can see these are cells within<br>the sphere and because of lighting it's<br>not as clear but here's a few cells that<br>are lighting up red so as we can see<br>some cells are able to divide when<br>they're in the sphere and interestingly<br>these cells are not within the sphere<br>and what we can see is that cells don't<br>need to be within the sphere to be able<br>to divide so some cells are still<br>lighting up red even though they're<br>outside the sphere so cells are able to<br>migrate cells are able to divide<br>ourselves able to differentiate too so<br>let's go back to the image at day 10 and<br>take a closer look at this cell here and<br>what we can see is that this cell<br>doesn't normally appear like a limbal<br>stem cell because it's got these long<br>Creta silic projections and remember a<br>credit site as a specialized cell that's<br>seen in the middle layer of the the<br>cornea at the front part of the eye and<br>so what this tells us is that cells are<br>beginning to become specialized they're<br>beginning to differentiate but we had to<br>be sure so we had to check and so to do<br>this we looked at a<br>few markets and I'm gonna talk and I'm<br>going to show you one today which is an<br>important marker and the name of the<br>marker is Alfa smooth muscle actin<br>rather than the name which is not<br>important is the fact that it indicates<br>a myofibril blast again the more<br>important thing is that this cell is a<br>wound healing cell so it's commonly seen<br>in wound healing it's a repair cell and<br>so what we can see here is these cells<br>have migrated away from the sphere and<br>these green lines here are the<br>individual filaments inside the cell in<br>fact these filaments are alpha smooth<br>muscle actin so the cells that have<br>these green lines are positive for that<br>marker and that means that these cells<br>are the repair cells and so what this<br>means is that some cells are able to<br>differentiate as they move away from the<br>sphere and so in summary what we've<br>shown is that spheres can survive they<br>can adhere and they can maintain this<br>stimulus and credit conic tissue and<br>cells can migrate from spheres and<br>appear to become more differentiated as<br>they do so this is the first time that<br>we've been able to culture stem cell<br>enriched spheres and create a conic<br>tissue and our research shows real<br>potential for treating credit kindness<br>in the future potentially even being a<br>cure<br>so currently on the on the wait list<br>there's about six months booking in<br>advance for corneal transplants in<br>public and in private even up to<br>February so there's quite a lot of<br>people on the wait list and if we can<br>use spheres we can cut down the number<br>of transplants that are needed so our<br>future research is through get some<br>quantitative data to look at spheres in<br>real time to study cells to study the<br>spheres in live tissue implants and<br>importantly to study the functional<br>aspects of these spheres so if we can<br>replace the cells do that produce the<br>matrix as well<br>I'd like to thank my team and a<br>heartfelt thank to heartfelt thank you<br>to the corneal donors and their families<br>for donating the tissue without whom<br>this would of course not be possible and<br>all the people who have helped me in<br>this who I haven't listed because the<br>journey would because the list would be<br>so exhaustive and thank you all for<br>sorry what was it that's a good question<br>so that's true we don't completely<br>understand the underlying process that<br>causes the disease correct but these<br>fears that we implant are from normal<br>human donors so one of the things that<br>we want to see is that the cells can<br>behave normally when they're put in this<br>disease matrix and that's why we've got<br>I haven't been able to show you but<br>we've got controls and that shows that<br>they seem to be behaving the same in the<br>credit conic matrix another thing is<br>that credit CONUS we although we don't<br>completely understand it we do<br>understand that there's genetic<br>influences and there's also<br>environmental influences that influence<br>the disease and its progression so if<br>you're implanting normal cells into a<br>disease process what we're seeing is<br>that they're behave normally at the<br>moment of course we need to do some<br>at the moment we've followed it for 14<br>days yeah yeah so that's a really good<br>question<br>my works not to look at the<br>epidemiological or the the causes as per<br>se I was more focusing on a potential<br>treatment but at the moment what we<br>think is just half possibly genetic<br>yeah that's a good question too<br>so one of the things there's many steps<br>but initially what we can look at is<br>just look at a staining for take a<br>control that hasn't been implanted and<br>take controls that have been implanted<br>earlier and compare them all and as time<br>permits<br>you can stain for these for the collagen<br>so collagen is the main thing that is<br>made up on the matrix and we can just<br>stand for it using immunohistochemistry<br>so some of the images I showed you is<br>just proteins that are present and we've<br>tagged it and then it flourishes so we<br>can do that look look to see if the<br>number mount of collagen increases over<br>time so especially compared to non<br>implanted and implanted we can also do<br>mRNA analysis so before proteins comes<br>genetics and we can look at that other<br>thing is down the track we can look at<br>some clinical tests are like corneal<br>thickness which we can do and yeah at<br>yes so there's no animal there's no<br>animal models at the moment that we can<br>model create OCONUS so that's why<br>studying Kurata CONUS itself is quite a<br>hard disease as well I have had the<br>privilege and the fortune of getting<br>enough tissue from human donors who have<br>received transplants to be able to do<br>all my work in human corneas but for<br>functional studies I think if we just<br>continue using these ex vivo implants<br>and then just do the functional studies<br>on them first that can maybe guide<br>future potential studies yeah that would<br>be my best answer for that at the moment<br>we do have other work like so not incur<br>a CODIS button and another disease which<br>is called limbal stem cell deficiency so<br>basically from chemical injury or a burn<br>or something the stem cells themselves<br>die and the eye goes white so that<br>person can't see we've seen that in some<br>of those patients where corneal<br>transplants by themselves are not<br>working you can put these spheres you<br>can put stem cells and Limbo explants<br>onto them and it seems to restore vision<br>so maybe that might be another<br>functional way so you know in the<br>extreme cases where other treatments are<br>not working we might be able to give<br>them another like him we can try this<br>yeah</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
