personal relevance for me as<br>well I grew up in a country where the<br>kind of education that I'm talking about<br>I am a product of that education and I<br>have experienced all the conflict that I<br>am going to mention in this presentation<br>so it's not just a kind of a mental<br>curiosity because of which I am<br>presenting all this but it is something<br>that I have experienced and I have<br>experienced it very recently in 2008<br>when there was a huge military operation<br>in the in the area after the Taliban<br>took over for a brief time and then they<br>were overthrown so I have I have titled<br>my topic I took off words because this<br>is what is going on there is a conflict<br>along the educational fault line and I'd<br>like to put this in perspective by<br>mentioning the highly controversial and<br>best-selling book of Samuel Huntington<br>clash of civilizations in which he<br>claimed that the 21st century will be<br>shaped along battles and clashes would<br>be more along the cultural fault lines<br>instead of being primarily fashioned by<br>that give rise to a lot of hate<br>mongering as the listeria typing in the<br>media in the public Islam and Western<br>countries and Western civilization they<br>were conceptualized as being in clash<br>with one another now Huntington said<br>that the New World Order would be<br>characterized by the fact that the<br>greatest division among humankind and<br>the dominating source of conflict will<br>be culture and the area of study that I<br>have been interested in for the last<br>fourteen years and help in teaching<br>language in a university in my country<br>is language that's my area of interest<br>for the last fourteen years the<br>dimension and that is closely connected<br>with culture<br>and that's why I am interested to see<br>whether the conflict scenario that<br>Huntington talks about and the<br>increasing conflict conflicts that we<br>see around us in the post 9/11 era can<br>they be conceptualized in terms of<br>language so I want to see what is the<br>relationship between language and<br>culture on the one hand it has been said<br>that language is at the core of a<br>culture and each a even goes further the<br>gentleman philosopher says we live in a<br>prison house of our language by which he<br>means that our worldview is fashioned by<br>the kind of language that we were born<br>into which affects not only the way we<br>see ourselves but it also affects the<br>way we see others it has both potential<br>as well as potential as well as hazards<br>so relationship between language and<br>culture language is obviously one of the<br>distinguishing feature of our species it<br>is where distinguishing distinguishes us<br>from the non articulate Kingdom language<br>is the central and giving us our<br>identity and as I mentioned before it is<br>a defining feature of it defines and<br>limits the range of our thinking and<br>worldview and this is indirectly in<br>connection with identity the way we see<br>ourselves the way we see others that is<br>how we form our identity so this brings<br>me to language in education if there is<br>a connection between language and<br>culture and language is space a<br>significant part is the central plays a<br>central part in education language and<br>education and culture how can they be<br>understood in terms of its effect upon<br>the identities of those who learn a<br>language that's why I have taken to<br>school systems in Pakistan and I in<br>order to see are we preparing the<br>children in these schools for hatred or<br>accommodation in the future because in<br>the increasing error of mobility<br>international mobility Globetrotter<br>globe-trotting and globally possibility<br>of<br>buying across continents there is both<br>potential and danger for global harmony<br>as well as global conflict I have taken<br>the dividing line between these two two<br>schools as English because the land the<br>English language it provides a kind of<br>ticket to upward social mobility<br>it's the doorkeeper for upward social<br>mobility and it's because of that apart<br>from identity that the tussle in a<br>society like in my country arises so I<br>have taken these two schools which are<br>situated in my country which is Pakistan<br>and I have conceptualized these two<br>schools is promoting national and<br>Islamic identity on the word on the one<br>hand because the country projects itself<br>as an Islamic country and the nation the<br>state is usually because it is portrayed<br>as synonymous with Islam in the<br>political discourse as well as in the<br>media on the earth and they are using<br>local textbooks in these schools the<br>government schools in order to instill a<br>local Islamic identity in the children<br>on the other hand there are the elite<br>schools which are giving english-medium<br>instructions along the lines of British<br>school systems and they are installing<br>more global identity and liberal<br>identity in disturbance and they are<br>using books which are Oxford endorsed<br>now the education system is focused on<br>the education field is a conflict zone<br>and a few glimpses apart from many other<br>can be seen in the case of Malala<br>yousafzai when she was shot when she was<br>on her way home from her school in 2012<br>at that time she was only 14 she was<br>going to an english-medium<br>private school and she had been<br>advocating universal education for girls<br>and the Taliban threatened her but as<br>she said we realized the importance of<br>our voice when we are silenced and they<br>tried to silence her but she didn't she<br>survived<br>she not only survived but went on to<br>collect the Nobel Prize for P for peace<br>then another event happened in 2014<br>religious extremists attack an army run<br>school in a northern city of the shower<br>more than 130 children were killed these<br>are these are tragic but true stories so<br>my question is the national and Islamic<br>identity on the one hand which is<br>promoted by the hundreds and thousands<br>of schools throughout the country and on<br>the other hand the global and Western<br>identity which is so blatantly<br>proclaimed and promoted by the private<br>schools which are also if not in<br>hundreds and thousand at least ten<br>thousands throughout the country what is<br>it doing to the children where is the<br>voice of the children what do they think<br>they get when they are in a foreign<br>language class so whether it is these<br>children who are studying in a private<br>school sitting in a cushy environment or<br>these children who are sitting on the<br>floor in a government school both of<br>these need to be heard and I think their<br>voices should be put together the two<br>schools have two ideologies as I<br>mentioned before the government schools<br>there have more Islamic ideology their<br>English distort is a foreign language<br>and the key line the key word is foreign<br>here<br>what are these children getting and what<br>the teachers think that these children<br>should become in the future what is the<br>conception of the teachers about dear<br>students and what is the conception of<br>these students about themselves in the<br>future so because of the social and<br>cultural repercussions and importance of<br>of this topic I have set my topic in a<br>post structuralist framework in order to<br>see phenomenon of assimilation and<br>resistance in these two schools and to<br>place it in a post-colonial context by<br>assimilation I mean acceptance of<br>Western culture teaching books to<br>children which has Christmas snowfall<br>Santa Claus and by resistance I mean<br>wiping everything<br>teaching them about the mosque about<br>prayer about local culture but not<br>telling them anything about the West<br>these are the two extremes now I am<br>using as my method I'm using imagine<br>communities which is a concept which is<br>a construct proposed by Bonnie Norton in<br>order to see what these children want to<br>become in the future and what is the<br>effect of that imaginative flight upon<br>their learning so my methodology would<br>be to take the data from the students<br>and the teachers through interviews<br>analyze it in a critical discourse<br>analysis in order to put it in the<br>broader socio cultural context I would<br>also be using other sources of<br>information my research and broadly are<br>how culture and linguistic identities<br>that the students are shaped in these<br>two schools what are their imagined<br>communities when they are studying<br>English as a foreign language and what<br>effect does it have on learning of<br>English in the meantime Malala turned 18<br>the previous year she is doing a lot of<br>work in my country as well as another<br>and she opened a school for refugee<br>girls in the Syrian refugee camps while<br>I dream I dream I dream of a just an<br>equal education system for all children<br>yeah please because I think that apart<br>from the identity crisis that I'm going<br>to focus on this identity crisis is just<br>a manifestation of a larger<br>socio-economic phenomenon which is which<br>is structured along the class system in<br>the in the society so the class system<br>it perpetuates itself in collusion or in<br>agreement with the education system the<br>education system provides very little<br>opportunity of good education for these<br>children and they have very little<br>opportunity of getting quality teaching<br>in English and English in the country in<br>this country is the key to access hyper<br>hyper jobs access high high positions in<br>the military and the bureaucracy<br>politicians business everywhere you see<br>so these children they are they account<br>for 92 percent of the population the<br>children's you are right they account<br>for about 4 to 5 percent while there are<br>other schools that are in the middle<br>they account for 3 to 4 percent so by<br>just I mean why the education system is<br>not being being being harmonized in a<br>way that every child whether they are<br>born to poor parents or to rich parents<br>thank you the challenges are that on the<br>one hand these the elite schools<br>especially they would not want<br>themselves to be put in the same basket<br>with D with the non elite schools<br>because they're them setting them sort<br>of themselves as you know symbol status<br>so at first I would I had a bit of a<br>challenge in convincing them that I am<br>NOT a threat to them I'm not going to<br>degrade dheere dheere dheere value in<br>the society I'm not going to declare<br>their prestige by putting them against a<br>school which to them is like nothing and<br>they would say like oh you're going to<br>place us against them but we will train<br>our teachers and and and and and Oxford<br>certified trainers they come to<br>Islamabad and they train or a teacher<br>and you are placing against those goals<br>so I said no this is not my purpose and<br>I had to do quite some bit of convincing<br>that I am here just as an observer I am<br>NOT here to judge I'm just trying to<br>find out what is happening and to<br>there's a key point the all the the<br>proliferation of the private sector in<br>the country it is because of the lake of<br>a clearly defined education policy in<br>the country so the education policy is<br>in place but if you reread the document<br>by the end of reading the document you<br>did to the last page you get no sense of<br>what they want people to do there is so<br>much school for people to define it in<br>their own way and that is what they are<br>taking advantage of some people are<br>teaching Oxford in those books other<br>people are printing their own books in<br>the country there is a government school<br>system which is printing its own books<br>there are mud races which are printing<br>religious books so this is all because<br>of a lake of a clearly defined education<br>policy and is that you point to that<br>very well this is a central concern for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
