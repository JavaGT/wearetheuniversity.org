study<br>participants that's my biggest wish in<br>life is that she dies before me no I<br>would not leave her vulnerable to the<br>state and that is a big admission our<br>child should die before us because at<br>least he has gone in front of our eyes<br>and we don't have to worry about how we<br>will live in the future when a parent<br>wishes that my child should die before<br>me it tells you a lot on one hand it<br>tells you what it must feel like to<br>raise a child with high and complex<br>needs all your life and then suddenly<br>face a prospect of leaving that child<br>under someone else's care on the other<br>hand it also tells us a lot about our<br>society in our system it tells us that<br>our society has failed to understand the<br>needs of these parents as a system we<br>have failed to provide necessary support<br>to these parents and most importantly we<br>have failed to assure these parents that<br>look when you're no longer they your<br>child will be fine and live a good<br>quality of life my research aims to<br>understand what this parents want for<br>the long-term future of the children and<br>what we need to do differently to<br>support these families better so my<br>study participants are the parents<br>parents of adults with high and complex<br>needs when I say high in complex needs<br>these are the children who are dependent<br>upon others for all aspects of their<br>daily life right from personal kill to<br>decision making<br>I spoke to 14 parents in Oakland and 18<br>parents in Delhi and today as part of<br>this presentation I'm going to share<br>with you some of my key findings what<br>parents told me and I'm going to focus<br>on three areas what are some of this<br>vicious what are some of this worries<br>concerning the children's future and<br>what support these parents consider as<br>valuable and useful for them in their<br>family so let's start with the wishes<br>the parent told me that that wish that<br>the child would live in own home or with<br>two or three other people not in a<br>bigger group home with five six or seven<br>other people<br>and people of their choice not who what<br>somebody else is like that you will live<br>with Mary and you will live with John<br>parents are saying that my wish is that<br>my child should be able to choose who<br>they live with have enough funds to meet<br>all disability specific needs when you<br>are an adult with a high and complex<br>needs you still might have needs for<br>incontinence pads you might need lots of<br>extra medication you might make some<br>aids and equipment to support your<br>speech to support your mobility and<br>everything cost money so parents wish<br>that the children will have enough money<br>to meet all these needs live a<br>stimulating life doing what they like<br>parents told me that they don't want the<br>children to be stuck in front of the<br>telly all day they want them to be out<br>in the community doing activities and<br>doing what they like not what somebody<br>else decides for them so what I've<br>shared so far is what parents of both<br>the countries told me but some Indian<br>parents told me something that was quite<br>unique so I like to share that with you<br>they told me they would like the child<br>to live in a nice residential<br>institution now in New Zealand 20 years<br>ago we had de institutionalisation we<br>closed all those big buildings but in<br>India because there is no concept of<br>group homes there is no such concept as<br>homes based support so these parents are<br>so desperate they're saying I don't care<br>if there are 200 people living in the<br>building so long as there is a place<br>where my child can go after me only<br>condition is it should be a nice place<br>where they can live comfortably so<br>that's the wishes what are some of the<br>worries of these parents child may be<br>abused or taken advantage of parents<br>shared some horrific stories of physical<br>and sexual abuse that their own children<br>have suffered or that they've seen other<br>children suffering and the problem is<br>this children are very vulnerable<br>because they can't even report the abuse<br>if it is happening because often they<br>are nonverbal so abuse is a really big<br>concern for these parents quality of<br>care will not be as good as a parent<br>when you raise your child you are very<br>meticulous in particular about certain<br>aspect of their needs but what parents<br>are worried is when somebody else is<br>doing that cane will they do the same<br>will they wash our hair properly will<br>they dress him nicely when he goes out<br>in the community<br>we'll the clean between his fingers so<br>that's little mine of things parents are<br>worried that it won't be there when<br>somebody else is looking after my child<br>surviving not living earlier I said<br>parent wish the children to leave a<br>stimulating life now doing activities in<br>the community cost money when you go out<br>you have to pay for the activities you<br>have to pay for the transport and<br>parents are worried that I'm putting<br>some money from my pocket now but after<br>me if my child doesn't have this money<br>they won't be surviving sorry they will<br>be surviving but not living a life and<br>what about Indian parents they told me<br>where is the funds come from even the<br>basic needs here in Oakland we are<br>talking about money for activities but<br>for some Indian parents especially those<br>who are from low socio-economic<br>background they are saying who will<br>provide food and shelter to my child<br>when I'm not there so even that is a<br>worry there for them so you've talked<br>about wishes and worries what about<br>support these parents get two types of<br>support one what we call is a formal<br>support which comes from the government<br>informs of the funding all funded<br>services and the other one is what we<br>call is informal support which is<br>provided by friends family and neighbors<br>voluntarily without any cost to the<br>parents so what parents told me about<br>the significance of both these forms of<br>support in terms of formal support they<br>say it is significant in all areas for a<br>good quality of life whether it is<br>personal care whether it is mental and<br>physical health or social and vocational<br>they said that if there is good<br>government support then my child can<br>live a good quality of life in the other<br>significance is family can be family if<br>there is good government support then<br>family can just spend the time with the<br>children as family and don't have to<br>worry about being their caregiver being<br>the advocate being the behavior<br>therapist and they can just enjoy the<br>time as a mother or a father so good<br>formal support allows that to happen in<br>terms of informal support parents said<br>that leisure and Recreation is one area<br>where we really value informal support a<br>friend coming and saying come on I'll<br>take you out to the movie I'll take it<br>to the park today<br>a neighbor coming and saying I'll come<br>play house and we can play some board<br>games so it is this area of leisure and<br>Recreation where informal support<br>parents found it very significant Hume<br>chaos is paid care and this is very<br>informal support is very valuable when<br>it is paid can I'm here because I'm<br>getting paid for it and because I have<br>to care for you but when it comes to<br>informal support I'm here because I want<br>to and because I care about you so it is<br>this difference between care for you was<br>this care about you who you are as a<br>person and that only informal support<br>can provide so what are some of these<br>issues with this worth of supports lack<br>of choice lack of voice informal support<br>parents are often not given any choice<br>in what services are offered to them and<br>they don't have a voice in the decision<br>affecting their lives<br>lack of disability specific knowledge<br>caregivers who are working with this<br>children behind complicates often don't<br>have a clue what they're doing and why<br>only caregivers even the health<br>professionals don't know when a child<br>shows aggressive behavior they give some<br>extra medication said it the child and<br>he'll be quiet but they don't see that<br>that aggressive behavior is the way for<br>the child to say I need help which often<br>professional don't understand issue in<br>in was for Indian parents with formal<br>support is corruption in bribery<br>a lot of funds are allocated often but<br>hardly anything reaches to the ground it<br>all gets eaten up by the system in<br>between in terms of informal support the<br>issue is people are too busy now our<br>community is not not as close-knit as<br>they used to be in the past so it's<br>harder to get informal support even from<br>the siblings not reliable if a friend is<br>going to come and shower you and if a<br>friend calls you and says look I have a<br>problem with my family so I can't come<br>today you can say I don't care about<br>your family I want you here now you<br>can't demand that service from a friend<br>or a family member and you can't<br>complain if the quality of care is not<br>good so it is not reliable for long term<br>in for Indian parents diminishing joint<br>family system once upon a time this<br>support was readily available from<br>extended family more and more families<br>are now becoming nuclear<br>so this support which was readily<br>available has also gone what I'm hoping<br>that from all this rich information that<br>parents have shared with me I'll be able<br>to compile it all together and come up<br>with some robust set of recommendations<br>that would help this pairing fulfil some<br>of the wishes and I would like to finish<br>with<br>a word about worries I'm of the view<br>that real life worries and no different<br>than some letters written on the send<br>all we need for these worries to be<br>wiped off is a wave a wave of change a<br>wave of changing people's attitude a<br>wave of changing how we deliver our<br>services and I'm convinced that once<br>that wave of change comes our parents<br>will be better looked after that<br>will will be better looked after and I'm<br>hopeful that my study will be<br>instrumental in creating this wave of<br>change so do watch the space do watch<br>this wave thank you sorry yep oh thank<br>you yep I've worked in disability sector<br>for last 22 years<br>makes me feel like a dinosaur yeah I<br>worked in India for eight years and for<br>the last 13 years I've been working in<br>New Zealand disability sector and when<br>were also working is a teacher in India<br>parents often raised this concern about<br>oh I don't know what will happen to my<br>child but at that time as a teacher in a<br>special school I couldn't do much with<br>that subject so now when I decided to do<br>my PhD I said it's not now I will never<br>be able to address this so that's why<br>curative ah yep look there is a<br>wonderful welfare system here so the<br>parents can get support in practically<br>every aspect of the children's life<br>whether it is finding a home for the<br>child to stay whether it is as I say it<br>aids an equipment like if it somebody<br>needs will chase somebody needs hearing<br>aid so there is fantastic support and it<br>is available through different<br>ministries and in it's quite complex<br>because it depends on whether your<br>disabilities from birth or whether<br>you've got disabled as a result of<br>injury so that decides which agency will<br>play part in but by and large I have to<br>say we have got very good support system<br>thank you yep so what I did is I created<br>an advertisement and then I sought help<br>from a couple of non-government<br>organizations working in the sector both<br>in Oakland and in Delhi so I contacted<br>him I said look I'm doing such and such<br>a study here is my s check here is the<br>advertisement and they helped me<br>circulate my retirement<br>through the network so the parents were<br>part of the network they get to know<br>through these organizations so that was<br>really helpful right so the criteria was<br>that they have to be the parents of<br>children who are 18 years or over the<br>children should have high and complex<br>needs so if somebody was just physically<br>disabled or just intellectual disabled<br>but not requiring support in all aspects<br>of life then they were not included and<br>that the parent should be looking after<br>the child at home so if the child was<br>already placed in the residential in<br>tradition then I did not include those<br>parents so the criteria was 18 years in<br>other high-end complex needs living at</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
