and<br>i'm doing an MA in applied linguistics<br>and the Faculty of Arts and I'd like to<br>share with you my dissertation which as<br>you can see is on Oakland metaphors now<br>as you might guess from my accent I'm<br>originally from the UK but I've lived in<br>New Zealand for the last seven years and<br>I'll shortly be a citizen so I consider<br>Oakland my home which explains the<br>reason I'm interested in this topic but<br>why is this important for everybody well<br>some of you might be familiar with<br>Maslow's hierarchy of needs and you can<br>see that housing is a basic need and<br>that's why I'm interested in this topic<br>but what about metaphors some of you<br>guys might be familiar with metaphors<br>from poetry and literature when you guys<br>were at school and that is very much<br>where the linguistic research was held<br>that is until this book by George late<br>off of Mark Johnson which is very<br>seminal in this field call metaphors we<br>live by and the reason this book is<br>important is because whoa sorry they<br>should really show that the metaphors<br>were in everyday language and that<br>really was a huge shift within the field<br>now I'll try to summarize their theory<br>with this diagram they essentially<br>believe that we actually conceive of the<br>world in metaphors and that's how we use<br>language to express ourselves so for<br>example we might believe that argument<br>is war and so we used language such as<br>he attacked everything I said now these<br>are example the two key features within<br>the theory which is they call them<br>conceptual metaphor in terms of how we<br>can see things and linguistic metaphor<br>of how we express that it through<br>language so since this book came out<br>there's been a lot of research looking<br>at the language that we use and working<br>backwards to feel how to figure out how<br>we actually think and that have been the<br>way that research has generally been but<br>more recently there's been a researcher<br>Colin Cameron who argues that it could<br>actually work the other way around<br>perhaps the language that we use can<br>actually shape the way that we think so<br>for example if we use one set of<br>metaphors we might think in this way and<br>if we use another set of metaphors it<br>might lead us to think in another way<br>and that's something I'm inclined to<br>agree with and that's obviously what<br>advertising and counselors are<br>so hopefully believe as well so that<br>explains my topic of Oakland Housing and<br>also metaphors so my research question<br>is my research question is what are the<br>metaphors in Auckland housing as<br>reported by the New Zealand Herald 4<br>2015 which is historically the worst<br>housing affordability so far so I had to<br>look at every single day's papers of the<br>New Zealand Herald and so there are 365<br>copies to look through and I'd like you<br>to have a figure in your mind of a<br>number of how many of those would have<br>front page stories on housing so we'll<br>come and see how close you are a bit<br>later so what did I do well I did have<br>to use this machine which believe it or<br>not does exist right now in 2016 and<br>Auckland City Library I did fortunately<br>find a slightly newer version in the<br>University Library which made it a lot<br>easier so I essentially had to scan<br>through the archives of 2015 to find<br>articles now as I said to you before you<br>need to have our number in your mind<br>I'll come to that shortly but once they<br>found the relevant articles what I did<br>was I did two forms of analysis there<br>were a manual part because metaphor at<br>this stage it still has not been<br>automated fully yet but there is a<br>second stage of using a computer program<br>to enhance the reliability of my<br>findings so let's see how close your<br>number is so I had 365 papers to look<br>through I was actually 83 articles that<br>i found which means once every four day<br>so it's a very salient topic and from<br>these articles i found 215 linguistic<br>metaphors and we'll do an example<br>together so you see what I mean so this<br>is the first of three stages so here's a<br>front page so have a quick look at that<br>and maybe you can see some words that<br>kind of contrast with a basic or literal<br>meaning of words so these are the ones<br>that I selected and that was the first<br>page of what I had to do for every<br>single article that I found so the<br>second stage is what we're about to do<br>now which is just having a look at the<br>example that we found and then working<br>backwards so this would the conceptual<br>metaphor ahm is open housing market<br>being a moving car of the connecting<br>with breaks and proprietary birds is was<br>to do the word soaring now although a<br>lot of birds saw actually a vast<br>majority of them tend to be predatory<br>birds such as Eagles etc now that's a<br>second stage and as i did this i began<br>to find patterns of meaning that kind of<br>kept reoccurring so the third final<br>stage is finding metaphor clusters so<br>for example car would go under the topic<br>of vehicles and predatory birds would be<br>under danger so by doing that I'd<br>actually found a total of twenty-two<br>metaphor clusters but three were highly<br>salient because they've top three<br>accounted for forty percent of all the<br>data and these are the top three as<br>you've just seen and these these numbers<br>relate to the 215 and articles so that's<br>the manual part of the analysis done but<br>what about the computer part well that's<br>using this program called W matrix which<br>comes from lancaster university in the<br>UK and the key point that this does is<br>that it assigns a meaning category for<br>each word so there are 21 categories<br>these are all of them but we're going to<br>look at this one in particular and each<br>of these have subdivisions so for<br>example for government and public domain<br>you'll see that g3 is warfare so that's<br>the tag that I can use to find all words<br>connected with war so we can see here<br>that we've got g34 warfare all the<br>others for heat and danger as well so by<br>doing this I could then compare my<br>manual results with what I found so why<br>doing that I find something like this<br>and I have a look and I can see that<br>these are all the words connected with<br>warfare and then I have to click on the<br>blue lines to find each individual hit<br>list for each of them so shortly I'll do<br>an example for hit because you can see<br>you still have to read them manually<br>it's not been done automatically yet I<br>still had to click through that for all<br>of the categories that I found so by<br>doing this I found I was able to compare<br>my manual analysis with a corpus<br>analysis and what I found was that there<br>was an increase of almost twice for born<br>heat which means they're actually even<br>more salient than I originally thought<br>now the reason danger goes<br>down is to do the way that they<br>categorize it so I don't know why it's<br>moving story it's to do with it's<br>because in danger it was for example<br>specific words like alarm and bomb and<br>critical whereas it doesn't consider<br>words like predatory birds so if I go<br>back to my original research question I<br>wanted to know about Oakland Housing<br>metaphors well I can tell you that the<br>three key salient metaphors are war heat<br>and danger and I would argue that this<br>actually creates a metaphorical scenario<br>because each of those interrelate with<br>each other and actually you can say that<br>ocwen housing market is war in general<br>so what are the implications of this so<br>within my field a couple of things first<br>of all no one's really done anything<br>about housing and metaphor sets fessing<br>the second thing is in terms of<br>methodology everyone's either done<br>manual only or corpus only there's only<br>been one study 2007 where they actually<br>did both of them so that's something I'm<br>happy to have done and another thing<br>which I think for me is the most<br>personally the most important is that is<br>to do with if we talk back to looking at<br>language perhaps shaping the way that we<br>think then it's possible that if you<br>know if we construe that the oakland<br>housing market as war it could actually<br>affect our very actions so maybe you<br>feel that you have to be a soldier in<br>order to enter the war and you feel that<br>you're not properly armored maybe you're<br>not going to enter that war so we need<br>to know what all these metaphors are<br>because once you have that you can then<br>decide to accept it question it reject<br>it or resist it but before you can do<br>any of those actions you have to know<br>what they are and that's very very much<br>where this research comes in as a very<br>first step to do with housing and<br>metaphors<br>and I'm happy to answer any questions<br>now thank you yeah yeah it's a really<br>good question and yeah that's what it's<br>called conventional metaphor in fact<br>we're so sort of used to it that we<br>don't even think about it in a way like<br>you're saying like you didn't you got oh<br>yes that's right it's predatory Birds so<br>there's there's sort of two ways about<br>it first thing I need to say with this<br>research it's very much from a<br>linguistic point of view this is what we<br>think there's still the next up of<br>research talk about are they perceived<br>as such and there's a lot of research<br>that goes depending on the metaphors<br>they might be perceived differently but<br>essentially the key focus within this<br>research is that it's very subtle these<br>ways of presenting language that we<br>often don't necessarily think about it<br>but and you have to remember you have to<br>read the whole context of the article<br>for it to really come across as that<br>rather than just picking up that<br>ok interesting question so first of all<br>I didn't cherry-pick the metaphors I<br>looked at all the metaphors in all of<br>the text so I didn't choose the ones<br>that I wanted to find so this is what<br>I'm saying is that my findings relate to<br>how it is being reported so I'm only<br>answering the question of what I saw in<br>the article so that's what I can say so<br>if you want to have a different story<br>then it requires someone else to write<br>yeah so a lot of the articles they would<br>be like a main bit and there'll be a<br>mini insert where they had some people<br>sort of discussing their own situations<br>and I included that as well so some of<br>it a lot of it was from the journalists<br>as well and some of it was included as<br>part of part of the general story so<br>yeah um I just like to answer that<br>comment after I did my research I spoke<br>to a friend who just bought a house and<br>I said to this is what I find to go ah<br>that makes me feel better it's not just<br>me kind of like pepper made a bit a bit<br>yep<br>so I don't really understand that your<br>terms of social content and push content<br>I don't I I don't want there ok ok yes<br>yep yep Alec okay yep so what does I say<br>this is my Master's not my PhD as I said<br>in my parish to you someone suggested in<br>the previous round that I could look at<br>the comments for example in the in the<br>online version of the text just answer<br>your thing about the push content which<br>thank you as a new 10 for me am I<br>actually listened to a really<br>interesting article and Aaron dead they<br>had a big donors conference he and they<br>were saying that actually despite social<br>media being so prevalent actually that<br>the vast majority of our still get most<br>of our primary news from the push<br>content and we might respond to it in<br>social content I know that nowadays that<br>there's a spin-off and the conversation<br>so there are other ways of getting our<br>media but I think within the New Zealand<br>context when this is our main paper<br>still I think that probably still has a<br>lot of power I think maybe over time it<br>might change and it's definitely<br>something I could look at in the future<br>yep</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
