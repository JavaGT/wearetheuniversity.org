0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>oh good evening ladies and gentlemen my<br>name is Sam Blanchett and I've just come<br>to the end of the first year of my PhD<br>up at the Faculty of medical and Health<br>Sciences my supervisors have been<br>associate professor Thomas proft and dr.<br>Jason loan and tonight is a fantastic<br>opportunity to share what I've been<br>doing throughout throughout the year<br>which has been working on my project<br>vaccines delivered on bacterial here so<br>this probably raises a few more<br>questions and these are questions that I<br>hope to answer over the next 10 minutes<br>so first I thought I'd just start off by<br>talking about vaccines so there are many<br>diseases out there where there is no<br>vaccine available whether it be a major<br>exotic disease such as Ebola or malaria<br>or something a lot closer to home wake<br>is sore throat or a skin infection<br>something we've probably all had there<br>is no vaccine available for any of these<br>diseases so vaccines are needed in the<br>community they are the most cost<br>effective efficient way of treating<br>diseases they're so effective that<br>they're actually able to eradicate<br>diseases you've probably never heard of<br>anybody with smallpox it's been wiped<br>from the face of the earth with a<br>successful vaccination program in terms<br>of medical and economic outcomes it's<br>better to prevent infections than to<br>treat them I know I'd rather have a few<br>injections and spend days sick and off<br>work and with antibiotic resistance it's<br>a lot harder to treat infection so<br>prevention is becoming more and more our<br>only option so over the last few<br>centuries vaccines have developed quite<br>significantly this first image up here<br>is Edward Jenner administering the first<br>vaccine of live smallpox to an<br>unsuspecting child good luck getting the<br>ethics for that in today's world so over<br>time vaccines have developed we've<br>realized injecting live pathogenic<br>bacteria into somebody is not such a<br>good idea<br>so vaccines these days tend to have<br>bacteria or microbes that are<br>significantly weakened that aren't<br>healthy we're four so come to learn that<br>we don't actually need the whole microbe<br>to elicit a successful immune response<br>that's why vaccines such as the<br>hepatitis B vaccine sorry use proteins<br>found on the surface rather than the<br>entire bacteria now we don't even need<br>the whole protein we can just use a<br>small section of the protein and that's<br>called a peptide and peptide back scenes<br>are the cutting edge of vaccine<br>development today now like everything<br>they<br>their advantages and their disadvantages<br>some of the advantages include the fact<br>that there's no infectious material so<br>there's no risk of getting sick from<br>this vaccine and you're able to<br>specifically target an immune response<br>with this small peptide additionally<br>there's also no risk of an allergic<br>reaction like there is with some<br>conventional vaccines now of course<br>there are disadvantages and some of<br>these include peptides don't do anything<br>the immune system doesn't respond to<br>them they're unstable in the body the<br>body just Chuck's them in the rubbish<br>and to get them to elicit an immune<br>response you need to use potentially<br>toxic edge events and these can require<br>expensive chemical coupling so that's<br>where we're at with vaccine development<br>in this day and age so moving towards<br>bacteria our bacteria actually carry not<br>quite they have these long hair like<br>projections across the surface of the<br>cell wall and these are called pillow<br>now a pillow is one singular protein<br>repeated over and over and over again so<br>in these long ones what we have is<br>thousands of copies of this one protein<br>in these shorter ones but they might<br>only be a few hundred copies but the<br>take-home message is that it's just one<br>protein so are all bacteria bad do they<br>all cause disease well no each person in<br>here has ten times more bacterial cells<br>in their body than their own cells so by<br>sheer number we're all more bacteria<br>than we are us now this isn't a bad<br>thing some of the bacteria are our<br>friends such as that found in lecto caca<br>sorry such as that found in yogurt like<br>to call collectors now of course we<br>can't be friends with everybody and<br>there are bacteria out there that will<br>do us harm such as those that cause<br>infections like sore throats and in this<br>so the concept with pelvics peles<br>vaccine is to take this hair like<br>projections and put the genes<br>responsible into the friendly bacteria<br>so what we end up with is this friendly<br>bacteria that select Akaka selectors<br>that expresses these hairlike<br>projections from Group A streptococcus<br>on its cell surface<br>now the immune system sees these<br>hairlike projections and recognizes the<br>bacteria as unfriendly and thinks you<br>want to do me harm so I'm going to<br>destroy you now the good thing about<br>pelvics is that the bacteria wouldn't<br>cause us disease anyway so there's no<br>risk of infection but the immune system<br>thinks there might be and if we include<br>a peptide into this hair like structure<br>inside that one protein what we get as<br>thousands of copies of this one protein<br>expressed on the pillars and the immune<br>system will catch that peptide in the<br>crossfire and we'll get an immune<br>response to that peptide so pill vets if<br>we go back to the advantages and<br>disadvantages of peptide vaccine and put<br>it into a pill VAX concept pelvics<br>removes a lot of the disadvantages that<br>we find in peptide vaccines because the<br>peptide is contained within this highly<br>immunogenic structure we get an immune<br>response the structure also protects the<br>peptide from degradation so it's<br>protected from the body and because the<br>bacteria stimulates the immune system it<br>removes the need for expensive chemical<br>coupling and removes the need for<br>potentially toxic agents we also get a<br>bunch of bonus advantages bacteria are<br>very cheap and very easy to grow some<br>people don't like vaccines because they<br>have a fear of needles so we can<br>administer this orally and we're also<br>able to freeze-dry this vaccine which<br>makes logistics and distribution a lot<br>easier a lot of vaccines are temperature<br>sensitive so being able to ship<br>essentially a powder to places such as<br>Africa with refrigeration supply lines a<br>difficult and expensive makes this<br>highly applicable and a lot cheaper than<br>traditional vaccines<br>so when we take a gene from one bacteria<br>and modified a little bit and put it<br>into another we have to make sure that<br>that new bacteria is actually expressing<br>that gene and the way we do that is by<br>carrying out a Western blot so we<br>extract the cell surface proteins from<br>the bacteria and run it on a gel this<br>gel separates the proteins by size so at<br>the top of the gel we have large<br>proteins and at the bottom we have<br>smaller proteins that have easily<br>migrated through the gel we then search<br>for our protein of interest with an<br>antibody and their antibody when we put<br>it into a machine gives us a signal that<br>comes up as a black line so in<br>streptococcus pyogenes the species where<br>we're getting these pearl from what we<br>see is this laddering pattern and if you<br>remember back to this image where there<br>are very different lengths of pillow<br>that's what we had expect so because<br>there are some large ones there at the<br>top of the gel and because there's some<br>small ones there at the bottom and<br>there's a lot of intermediate sizing so<br>where there is this ladder when we put<br>this into lactic caucus we see the same<br>thing so that means that this bacteria<br>is expressing the genes successfully<br>this third Lane is just a control is<br>select a caucus that hasn't been<br>modified and you don't see any laddering<br>as you would expect so we know that<br>pelvics works from this pilot study that<br>was carried out in our lab so on the<br>y-axis what we have is just the level of<br>antibody response and on the x-axis as<br>the experiments that we carried out so<br>the first look sorry the first one we<br>don't see in the antibody response and<br>this is where we've just injected the<br>mice will the test peptide this test<br>peptide is called over and we don't see<br>a response and if you think back to the<br>disadvantages of peptides this is<br>expected because on their own they don't<br>do anything so with our pelvics contract<br>that we see in the blue that contains<br>the test peptide we see quite a<br>significant antibody response as<br>comparable to this green one which is<br>over that has been immunized with the<br>traditional edge event cholera toxin B<br>now this was just to test how effective<br>pelvics was compared to a more<br>traditional conventional vaccination and<br>we get a similar response but only when<br>there's 50,000 nanograms of over<br>compared to five nanograms and the<br>pelvics construct so this means there is<br>twenty barrels<br>times less peptide and the pelvic<br>construct which is quite amazing to<br>elicit such a response so now that we<br>know that it works what we want to test<br>for is how versatile this is what<br>diseases we can use to vaccinate and one<br>of the ones we've chosen is tuberculosis<br>now there is a vaccine available for<br>tuberculosis you might have heard of it<br>some of you might have even had it the<br>BCG vaccine but it's largely ineffective<br>this bacteria has been described by the<br>World Health Organization as a global<br>health emergency it kills more people<br>than any other bacteria and it causes<br>quite significant and nasty lung<br>infections so the way we're going to<br>target it is by targeting this a set sex<br>protein now is that sex is essential for<br>bacterial virulence in this disease if<br>you remove this gene from the bacteria<br>it can't cause infection if you<br>complement this gene into a strain that<br>doesn't cause infection all of a sudden<br>it can cause disease so if we target<br>this and remove its ability to have an<br>effect we should be able to prevent<br>tuberculosis infection so this is the<br>whole protein in the bit we're targeting<br>is just that small circle but at the top<br>the peptide the small section of the<br>protein and when we incorporate the gene<br>for this into our construct we want to<br>make sure that the gene we've modified<br>and put into a new bacteria is<br>expressing so we carry out the Western<br>blot and what we see is this positive<br>control with the laddering pattern and<br>we again see the laddering pattern in<br>our construct so that our future work<br>will be to vaccinate mice with this<br>pullbacks construct and to test for<br>antibodies and other immune responses<br>and to determine whether or not this<br>vaccine offers protection so there's a<br>lot of exciting work ahead finally I'd<br>just like to acknowledge my lab group<br>for all their help and support as well<br>so what the immune system is responding<br>to was not the bacteria itself is<br>responding to the pillow so the pillow<br>comes from streptococcus pyogenes and<br>this is a human exclusive pathogen that<br>the immune systems evolved with over<br>many many years and so it's come to<br>recognize this as a as a danger signal<br>and that sets off the immune response<br>the bacteria itself the Elector caucus<br>doesn't really do anything and if you<br>eat yogurt you're not going to get it<br>so countries that we might want to<br>saxing in first so tuberculosis is quite<br>a worldwide issue it's estimated that<br>about two-thirds of the world's<br>population actually is infected with<br>tuberculosis in a country like New<br>Zealand that's going to be a very low<br>number but in some places like<br>Afghanistan or sub-saharan Africa that<br>will be up around nineteen ninety five<br>percent so sort of the third world<br>countries is where would be best suited<br>for first in terms of maximum effect<br>distribution and at end administration<br>that's still something that's being<br>worked on but there are various ways you<br>could do it you could include it in an<br>ice cream or a yogurt or all sorts of<br>other things and you can ship it to<br>these places quite easily because you<br>can freeze dry and it's basically in a<br>powdered form that could be added to a<br>number of things so it is quite easy to<br>administer<br>so this is quite a novel technology<br>that's been developed and recently<br>patented by our lab so does the first<br>sort of thing out there like this<br>the only other similar thing I can think<br>of is something by June Scott's group<br>overseas who what they've done is they<br>add their peptide at the very tip of the<br>pillars so the pillars like I said is<br>that one protein for the most part there<br>are a few other proteins for anchor it<br>to the cell wall and one at the top that<br>helps in adhesion for pathogenesis and<br>so I want what one group has done is to<br>put their peptides at the top of the<br>pillars but this isn't as effective<br>because you want to get one copy per<br>pillars whereas with l1 you have one<br>copy per protein in the backbone and<br>because the backbone can have thousands<br>of copies in one pilis or hundreds you<br>get lots and lots and lots of copies of<br>this peptide so there's lots of exposure</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
