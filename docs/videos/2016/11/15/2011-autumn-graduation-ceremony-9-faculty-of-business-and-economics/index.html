so that their<br>children would<br>succeed they came from two different<br>cultures they were raised in two<br>different countries with belief systems<br>and both had English as a second<br>language on the face of it they had<br>nothing in common yet<br>curiously they shared a belief in the<br>power of learning and knowledge as the<br>key to survival and success in the<br>modern<br>world Ry she was born in a multicentric<br>world in<br>1927 in the back blocks of the white<br>totra Valley 2 hours north of<br>wongo as the eldest child riy was taken<br>from her birth birth parents as was<br>custom and raised by her nanny py the<br>matriarch of the<br>family Nanny P's house had dirt floors<br>and Pung of walls it was a quiet life<br>nny cooked for her and handmade all her<br>clothes including her underwear which<br>was sewn out of flower<br>sacks when Ry was six years old she<br>proudly went to school in her handmade<br>clothes for the first time in her<br>sheltered life she was hit by an adult<br>for speaking maldi in class so she had<br>fast by the time Rie was 10 years old<br>she was bilingual but it was decided by<br>the family Elders that she quit school<br>to work as a land girl on the<br>farm when she turned 16 Ry Met Her Seven<br>Brothers and Sisters For the First Time<br>at her birth mother's<br>funeral on the the last day of that<br>funeral RI and her brothers and sisters<br>aged from 6 months to 16 years were<br>placed in the middle of the midi and all<br>the people present were told to take<br>whichever child they<br>wanted R and a younger sister were taken<br>in and stayed with several extended<br>family members where they were treated<br>like house<br>slaves this continued until as a young<br>adult RI moved to wanganui where she got<br>a job in a sewing<br>Factory and it was at the age of 25<br>years old that she met a foreigner and<br>his name was<br>Rex now Rex he was born in<br>sore and thanks to the hard work of his<br>dad and on the pl family Plantation he<br>was sent to the English speaking School<br>in<br>Aria on weekends he would return home<br>and speak English to his mother and get<br>beaten for<br>it as he Grew Older the family agreed<br>that Rex be sent to study and become a<br>church<br>Minister however he was expelled from<br>theology school after an attempted<br>daughter after several other failed<br>initiatives Rex decided to try New<br>Zealand and in those days the<br>application included health checks<br>English language checks and you had to<br>have proof of a New Zealand<br>address each day the S Mo radio would<br>read out the names of the successful<br>immigrants and Rex could hardly believe<br>it when his name finally came out but<br>how could he for the passage to New<br>Zealand his village rallied around and<br>raised the money for his fear to Oakland<br>and so at last he was on his way to the<br>land of milk and<br>honey when Rex arrived at the ockland<br>warf he had confidently thought that the<br>dress of his friend in wongi was like<br>sore just down the road<br>but luckily for him a Good Samaritan<br>paid for his travel to<br>wongi Rex quickly got a job with the<br>railway Department as a laborer this was<br>a job he was to stay with until his<br>retirement and it was in wongu that he<br>met and married rii they had four very<br>brown fuzzy haired children and they<br>wanted more for them than the life that<br>they had<br>experienced they both believed in the<br>transformative nature of Education<br>telling their kids without an education<br>you'll be a no<br>hoper their children were encouraged to<br>read and often chores could be escaped<br>as long as you could prove that you were<br>doing your<br>homework Rex and RI did not see barriers<br>of class<br>ethnicity occupation or language as<br>deterence to success in the modern<br>society with their modest combined<br>income and Rex's cashing in his Railway<br>super annuation scheme they invested in<br>their<br>children sending them to private schools<br>teacher training college and other<br>tertiary<br>institutions pushing them pushing them<br>to take advantage of their<br>education they gloried in their<br>children's Scholastic and business<br>successes and felt Vindicated that the<br>path they had taken so long ago was the<br>right one<br>these were my<br>parents today we celebrate the success<br>of not only your graduation but also the<br>hard work and loving sacrifices made by<br>your families to get

demonstrated<br>excellence and particular aspects of<br>teaching these awards are contestable<br>across the university and signify a<br>truly Superior<br>achievement an award for sustained<br>excellence in teaching has been made to<br>Dr Ross McDonald in the department of<br>management and international business<br>within the faculty of business and<br>economics and I now call upon a student<br>of that faculty cyan Coleman to read the<br>McDonald student and current colleague<br>to acknowledge today the outstanding<br>achievement of Dr Ross MacDonald<br>recipient of the sustained teaching and<br>excellence<br>award Ross McDonald is an exemplary<br>teacher he is passionate and wholly<br>committed not only is he concerned with<br>the delivery of his often challenging<br>and thought-provoking course content but<br>he also ensures a novel teaching and<br>learning<br>experience students are encouraged to<br>engage in meaningful critical<br>reflection they are persuaded to ponder<br>what sort of future they want to create<br>for themselves and they are challenged<br>to think of ways that they can en that<br>future<br>Ross persuades his students to think<br>critically about the world and the<br>systems in place that are often taken<br>for granted he does this in a manner<br>that subtly balances being both gentle<br>and accepting whilst also being candid<br>and<br>provocative students come out of the<br>other side of his courses being<br>thoroughly challenged with a newfound<br>perspective of the bigger<br>picture Ross's commitment and passion<br>for education is not only demonstrated<br>here in our own<br>backyard but he also works very closely<br>with the government of ban in the<br>development of that country's<br>curriculum Ross joined the university in<br>January<br>1996 in the 15 years since then I'm<br>certain of one<br>thing that he has made a lasting<br>impression on every single one of his<br>students that have been under his<br>instruction indeed a Facebook group was<br>created in his on over 5 years ago where<br>students have called Ross inspirational<br>an absolutely Legend and even an<br>undercover<br>superhero there is no doubt that Ross<br>McDonald is a most deserving recipient<br>of this award I am certain that<br>colleagues and peers of mine both past<br>and present together with all of you<br>today will join me in congratulating<br>achievement<br>and on behalf of the University I now<br>invite all today's graduates to stand<br>all<br>and this would be an ideal opportunity<br>for the graduates to show their<br>appreciation of their families and<br>supporters and the staff of the<br>University who have helped them as they<br>qualifications this concludes
