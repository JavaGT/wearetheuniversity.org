graduation ceremony<br>for 2011 of the University of<br>ockland this week the university is<br>bestowing a total of<br>278 qualifications on some<br>2,450<br>students at this ceremony degrees will<br>be conferred and diplomas awarded in the<br>faculty of science a total of 430 in<br>Absentia I am privileged as Chancellor<br>to preside at Spring graduation for a<br>third<br>year the regularity of graduation<br>ceremonies makes them no less special<br>for the University and me personally<br>than for those of you being capped here<br>today many for the first<br>time it is also a pleasure to return to<br>the ockland town hall long our<br>traditional graduation venue<br>for the first time since<br>2009 the aot center which we now use has<br>been temporally captured for Rugby World<br>Cup<br>purposes graduation is a festive event<br>rich in history Pomp and color with a<br>lively array of contemporary touches<br>here in Oakland our Rich mix of cultures<br>and ethnicities can be seen in the<br>Striking variety of dress and adornments<br>today is one of hard-earned<br>Celebration by you the gradu and<br>diplomates on your academic<br>accomplishments and by your family and<br>friends who have encouraged and<br>supported you and are here to share in<br>your<br>success the<br>university represented by the council<br>and academic staff members seated behind<br>me and those many staff who control<br>proceedings with remarkable Precision<br>takes equal pleasure at this hugely<br>significant day for each and every one<br>of<br>you the University of Oakland is<br>deservedly ranked as one of the best<br>universities in the world your<br>qualifications will always serve you<br>well in this country and abroad whether<br>in qualifying you for a satisfying<br>career or in leading to more advanced<br>study or simply as a root to personal<br>and intellectual<br>enrichment in today's everchanging<br>Workforce you cannot afford to stop<br>learning so please keep in mind our<br>opportunities I urge you as alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading University always<br>to remember your Elma Mar we depend<br>increasingly on our graduates for<br>support moral and political as well as<br>Financial your advocacy and influence of<br>vital and encouraging government and the<br>community at large to fund universities<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive economy and to create a full<br>and satisfying life for all new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>cheers The crucial contribution of major<br>research un universities is not well<br>understood and therefore insufficiently<br>acknowledged it is inconceivable that a<br>developed Progressive 21st century<br>Nation can maintain that status without<br>strong internationally recognized<br>research-based<br>universities such as the University of<br>Oakland our Innovative research is vital<br>for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social<br>cohesion never more so than in the<br>testing times we face in the wake of the<br>global<br>recession and the devastating Christ<br>Church<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing our<br>Institution for today is unquestionably<br>your day I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long cherish memories of<br>2011 we welcome as our speaker this<br>morning professor John Montgomery who<br>holds the chair of Marine Science at<br>this University of Oakland he is the<br>director of our Lee Marine laboratory<br>which is effectively our Marine campus<br>with state-of-the-art teaching and<br>research facil fa ities and an<br>impressive new interpretive Center for<br>visitors he is also on the board of<br>Antarctica New<br>Zealand Professor Montgomery gained a BC<br>honors degree at the University of otago<br>and both a PhD and a doctor of science<br>from the University of Bristol his<br>scientific work sits at the interface of<br>Marine Science and Neuroscience he has<br>published extensively on the sensory<br>behavior and physiology of fish<br>including hearing flow senses and the<br>novel electrosensory system of sharks<br>and<br>Rays his work has been recognized by<br>election to the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand and international brain research<br>organization fellowship and a Fullbright<br>scholarship he has also active in<br>promoting Marine Science and<br>communicating science to the public<br>Professor Montgomery<br>Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor University<br>colleagues<br>graduan parents family and friends it's<br>it's a great privilege to be invited to<br>to give this graduate address to you and<br>to share this<br>celebration a ceremony such as this is a<br>public tribute to the good decisions<br>made the hard work done and the support<br>provided by families friends and<br>teachers<br>and it's such a treat to see all the<br>support here the cultural diversity and<br>the depth of talent of you the<br>gradu your moment is shortly to come<br>when you cross the stage here and<br>receive your degree and we are here to<br>celebrate that<br>moment one way I like to think about A<br>Moment Like This is it's a bit like an<br>hourglass or given the lotted time<br>perhaps more like an oldfashioned egg<br>timer um I don't know whether you know<br>the ones I mean or not but there's an<br>hourglass shape made of glass with sand<br>in it and that when you turn it upside<br>down the the sand flows through that<br>narrow neck of the<br>glass and uh marks the passage of time<br>so when the when the sand has run out<br>the hour or the time has come to take<br>the egg off the<br>boil today's graduation is like an<br>hourglass in that um all the choices and<br>hard work of the past flow through a<br>point in time and open up the potential<br>of the future<br>some of these moments like the ceremony<br>today are surrounded by tradition and<br>illuminated by the stage<br>lights these moments are easy to see and<br>important to<br>treasure but I'd also like to in this<br>address Shine the spotlight on other<br>less obvious less public moments that<br>are no less important in the path that<br>has led you to the completion of your<br>degree there will have been moments and<br>I'm sure that all of you can bring them<br>to mind that will less well signpost Ed<br>but equally<br>important inspiration from a particular<br>teacher a specific commitment of support<br>from your family or a friend who's laid<br>down a challenge um which has led you<br>down this path and to the ceremony<br>today I can certainly remember critical<br>path choices of my own pedegree days as<br>a last year high school student having a<br>chat on cter Bay beach with professor<br>John Morton who in effect then held the<br>position that I now hold at the<br>university the upshot of that meeting<br>was a clear choice to study biology at<br>the University despite not having done<br>so at<br>school then again as a second year<br>student attending a lunchtime lecture by<br>visiting Professor um Eric Denton who<br>was the director of the Lee Marine<br>laboratory at<br>Plymouth and uh through subsequent<br>contact with Professor Denton he he<br>became my PhD advisor and this in turn<br>left led to a lifetime's interest in<br>work in the crossover area between<br>neuroscience and Marine Science as you<br>heard in the<br>introduction now let me just drill into<br>that a little bit neuroscience and<br>Marine Science may sound like an odd mix<br>but marine animals have formed important<br>models for the study of the nervous<br>system and for fundamental<br>Neuroscience to give you just two<br>examples at the pouth lab about 20 years<br>before I arrived there to do my PhD the<br>discovery had been made of how nerves<br>conduct action potentials and hence<br>transmit information from one part of<br>the brain to another or from the nervous<br>system out to the<br>muscles this was work was actually done<br>on squid by two researchers who names<br>were hodkin and Huxley and in<br>Neuroscience um they're very well known<br>for that<br>contribution perhaps a little less known<br>but interesting in terms of the theme<br>that I want to pursue today is that they<br>shared their Nobel Prize with John<br>Eckles who although an Australian did<br>this part of the work for the Nobel<br>Prize that he shared with them here in<br>New<br>Zealand in addition to that he was<br>responsible for setting out New<br>Zealand's first Marine laboratory<br>because he was well aware and understood<br>the importance of marine animals as<br>models for<br>Neuroscience if you need further<br>convincing there's just one other<br>example of the way in which Marine<br>Science and Neuroscience<br>intersect the second example is more<br>recent a scientist called Eric<br>candell again working at a Marine Lab<br>was awarded the Nobel Prize in<br>2002 for discovering the cellular basis<br>of learning he did this work on a marine<br>slug not unlike the ones that have been<br>washing up on our beaches the last<br>couple of Summers and poisoning the<br>dogs understanding the basis of how<br>nerves work and how learning occurs in<br>the nervous system are fundamental<br>discoveries<br>in science these discoveries are again<br>like passing through The<br>Hourglass a point in time a particular<br>discovery that opens up a wealth of<br>future<br>potential I've specifically mentioned<br>kandel's work because amongst other<br>things it has given us real insight into<br>how we see and remember these important<br>moments in our<br>lives it's all about<br>neuromodulation and it works pretty much<br>the same in sea slugs as it does in US<br>there's a bit of the brain called the<br>amydala that sits next to the area where<br>memories are laid<br>down what this bit of the brain does is<br>recognize the significance of what's<br>happening around us if the amydala fires<br>up it sends out the neuromodulation<br>signal to the adjacent brain area and<br>you'll lay down a strong memory of that<br>particular<br>occasion you don't have to know this to<br>appreciate the significance of your<br>ceremony today but knowing it may help<br>you recognize and see these moments of<br>opportunity in the<br>future some will be well signposted<br>others may not but you can coach your<br>mind's eye to see these special moments<br>of<br>opportunity these are the moments that<br>will open up the potential of your<br>future it's up to you to see the<br>moment so let me finish by again<br>extending my congratulations to you all<br>we celebrate your achievements and your<br>thank you Professor Montgomery for a<br>very interesting speech and uh reminding<br>our gradu on in particular that they are<br>laying down strong memories today and<br>and no doubt seizing the<br>moment this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the university for a<br>ceremony of conferring degrees and<br>awarding of diplomas<br>at this ceremony the pro- chancellor Ian<br>Pon and I will be conferring degrees and<br>awarding<br>diplomas I now invite the pro Chancellor<br>to
