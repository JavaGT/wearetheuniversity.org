than in these globally uncertain<br>Economic<br>Times universities such as ours equip<br>graduates like you not simply for the<br>job jobs of<br>today but for careers not yet<br>imagined the University of Oakland's<br>aspirations for the period ahead and our<br>responses to an increasingly constrained<br>funding environment are comprehensive<br>and<br>demanding they are taken shape in

universities received the<br>lowest income per student in the<br>developed<br>World your advocacy and influence are<br>vital in encouraging government and the<br>community at large to fund universities<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive economy and to create full<br>and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders that's enough for me

services<br>Chancellor pro-chancellor<br>Deputy Vice chancellors members of<br>council members of the University of<br>Oakland gradu families and<br>friends some of you may be thinking<br>there's a contradiction in having an<br>economist address you today just when<br>you were expecting this to be such a<br>happy<br>occasion but don't be alarmed this<br>economist is not going to talk about<br>sovereign debt crises in Europe budget<br>deficits Bond rates exchange rates or<br>concerns about International growth<br>prospects except to say that these sleep<br>depriving economic and financial issues<br>are greatly affecting the international<br>environment in which today's graduates<br>will pursue their<br>careers it's a fragile environment<br>fraught with constraints and much<br>uncertainty c as well as increasing<br>competitive<br>pressures so today's graduates will have<br>little option but to wear the Mantra of<br>efficiency and Effectiveness in<br>everything they do whatever and wherever<br>their roles might<br>be now we know that geographical<br>boundaries no longer determine the<br>matching of Talent with opportunity more<br>than ever we can expect a premium for<br>international and Multicultural<br>perspectives as well as a premium for<br>creativity and problem solving<br>skills that fly Emirates ad actually<br>grabs<br>attention tomorrow rewards the Curious<br>those who travel beyond the borders of<br>convention which leads me to my central<br>theme creating Your Own<br>Story those of you about to be capped<br>have already embarked on your journey<br>and you can have real pride in the<br>formal recognition at today's ceremony<br>of the credentials you have attained<br>across a wide range of disciplines in<br>the faculty of business and economics at<br>the University of<br>Oakland this is clearly a milestone<br>event and one that we are all here to<br>celebrate but just a stepping stone<br>nonetheless your stories are yet to be<br>created part of what we are celebrating<br>ating is the opportunity you each now<br>have to influence the future State and<br>reputation of business the opportunity<br>to Foster social and economic<br>advancement and we can only hope that<br>this opportunity will not be<br>squandered just think of how many<br>individuals here and around the world<br>who don't and won't have such an<br>opportunity who cannot even embar on a<br>journey that rewards the<br>Curious you are so fortunate to be<br>surrounded today by a suppor of Faculty<br>family and friends you will always be<br>indebted to them for the University<br>education you have had but they have<br>really done no more than help pave the<br>way for you to create your story what<br>they want for you more than anything is<br>that you use this education to unleash<br>whatever potential is within you none of<br>us knows on our graduation day what that<br>potential might be none of us knows the<br>destinations we will reach in our<br>Journeys now some aspects of my story<br>have just been shared with you your<br>stories have yet to be narrated they<br>will start with what's in your head and<br>they will end with what's in your head<br>one can only feel Sympathy for the young<br>Doctor tius lidgate Who in that great<br>and insightful 19 century novel Middle<br>March bitterly reflected that this is<br>what I am thinking of and that is what I<br>of as to dartha Brooke the central<br>female character in Middle March the<br>author concluded that the effect of her<br>spirit and everyday words and actions<br>was incalculably<br>diffusive for the growing good of the<br>world is partly dependent on<br>unhistorical acts now these words still<br>resonate nearly 15 years after they were<br>penned however diffusive the effect<br>might be what you say and do daytoday<br>matters how you deal with with issues of<br>trust dignity and Justice matters how<br>you navigate risk a conflict of interest<br>or dispute resolution<br>matters unhistorical acts they may turn<br>out to be but you have been handed the<br>Bon and like dtha you will be Paving the<br>way for those who<br>follow given the investment that has<br>been made in your University education<br>we are entitled to expect that you will<br>do your best to ensure that the sum of<br>your everyday actions will add value and<br>raise the average that you will help<br>others to realize their potential and<br>that you'll always be willing to<br>interrogate your own thinking bearing in<br>mind what Lord KES wrote a century ago<br>the difficulty lies not in the new ideas<br>but in escaping from the old on<br>on we are also entitled to expect that<br>in your head you will know that<br>professional and accountable accurately<br>describe the everyday conduct that will<br>anchor your<br>story maintaining high levels of<br>personal Integrity<br>matters your grades may be good and your<br>technical competence superb but like a<br>singer or violinist on this stage<br>something has to be added to distinguish<br>the end<br>result individual<br>interpretation it's the whole<br>performance that counts and it's the<br>preparedness to continue to learn and to<br>better that performance that counts<br>more now surely this audience would<br>disagree with the young tious lidgate in<br>Middle March for whom knowledge seemed a<br>very superficial Affair easily mastered<br>and hopefully today's gradin would<br>disagree with lidgate's view that<br>judging from the conversation of his<br>Elders he had apparently got already<br>more knowledge than was necessary for<br>mature<br>life mind you much of what clutters our<br>Airwaves and is available online is<br>hardly necessary for mature life when I<br>consulted Wikipedia just to remind<br>myself of what was going on on the<br>outside world in my my graduation year I<br>found amidst Beetle Mania Vietnam War<br>protests and the collapse of New<br>Zealand's wool economy that the World<br>Cup trophy for soccer was stolen at a<br>stamp exhibition in the<br>UK it was found under a hedge in<br>southeast London by a male mixed breed<br>colly dog named pickles who became a<br>celebrity and died soon after when he<br>choked on his lead chasing in a cat and<br>by the way the thief died of<br>emphysema now I must confess that the<br>place of pickles in the historical<br>record of world events had escaped me<br>what must not Escape today's graduates<br>is the opportunity to make the story you<br>create wherever in the world you create<br>it truly worthy of the University of<br>well on your behalf can I thank Miss<br>boder for some very interesting and wise<br>and valuable<br>observations and<br>advice this is a meeting of

Absentia all those other persons<br>named in the book of convocation<br>qualified for the conferment of a degree<br>diploma as you would expect the<br>university places great importance on<br>teaching and it recognizes this by<br>making Awards each year to teachers who<br>have demonstrated excellence in<br>particular aspects of<br>teaching these awards are contestable<br>across the university and signify truly<br>Superior<br>achievement an award for excellence in<br>Innovation and teaching has been made to<br>miss Angela louu in the department of<br>accounting and finance within the<br>faculty of business econom and economics<br>I call upon a student of that<br>faculty Kenny Chan to read the citation<br>Lou Angela's enthusiastic Innovative and<br>effective teaching has made a<br>significant contribution to teaching and<br>the accounting Information Systems class<br>and Anga showed an amazing level of<br>commitment to improving Student Success<br>in a topic that's usually pretty<br>difficult for students I was impressed<br>by her enthusiastic approach and the<br>large amount of time she invested to<br>developing resources to enhance<br>learning she introduced a comprehensive<br>range of e-learning resources her<br>teaching methods are always very clear<br>relevant and interesting and we<br>particularly enjoyed her pre-recorded<br>computer laboratory Workshop exercises<br>with audio narrated instructions and<br>explanations to guide students step by<br>step through each<br>problem in particular her students<br>enjoyed the flying lessons PowerPoint<br>slides these were animated diagrams with<br>voice over narration that ran through<br>each transaction cycle one step at a<br>time Angela also introduced regular FAQ<br>email announcements to explain to<br>students common issues raised by the<br>class and Angela didn't just develop<br>these resources<br>she collected data on how often students<br>were using the recorded lectures<br>workshops and E tutorials so that she<br>could analyze which ones were most<br>effective and continue to improve the<br>course Angela's Innovations have<br>resulted in the class being extremely<br>happy with the course and have taken<br>away the risk of frustration over<br>administrative and computer literacy<br>issues we able to put all of our energy<br>and understanding the course<br>content I believe the Angela deserves<br>this award because she has helped<br>students appreciate accounting and to<br>learn from a different perspective<br>Angela<br>on behalf of the University I now invite<br>all today's graduates to stand and<br>and this would be the perfect<br>opportunity for the graduates to show<br>their appreciation of their families and<br>supporters and the staff of the<br>University who have helped them as they<br>this concludes this meeting of council<br>and convocation of the university for<br>the confirmant of degrees and the award<br>of diplomas
