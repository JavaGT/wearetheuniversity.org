and<br>the community at large to fund<br>universities so they can generate the<br>knowledge needed to drive a productive<br>and competitive economy and to create a<br>full and satisfying life for new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>chair The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities such as ours is<br>not well<br>understood our Innovative research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social cohesion never more so<br>in the difficult Economic Times New<br>Zealand faces in the wake of the<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private philanthropy not<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing<br>Academia for today unquestionable L<br>belongs to you the gradu and you are its<br>primary focus I congratulate you and<br>trust that you will long cherish the<br>enjoyment and excitement of your<br>2011 we welcome as our speaker this<br>evening Dr Jeremy Hill who is currently<br>foner's Chief technology<br>officer Dr Hill is a graduate of the<br>University of Hull with a PhD in<br>Biochemistry<br>he has produced more than 100 published<br>papers and four patents and is a member<br>of the editorial board of the<br>international Journal of Deary<br>technology he has undertaken General<br>Management training at the University of<br>New South Wales and the SLO School of<br>Management at the Massachusetts<br>Institute of<br>Technology Dr Hitler has previously held<br>senior research and development<br>leadership roles at the livestock<br>Improvement Corporation and the New<br>Zealand Dair Research Institute<br>at fona he has been general manager of<br>manufacturing Innovation and of research<br>and Technical<br>operations he has also served as font's<br>director of Regulatory Affairs and food<br>Assurance he is a director on a number<br>of boards including the international<br>Dairy Federation and Global Dairy<br>Hill<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor members of<br>council members of the University<br>graduates family and friends it's a real<br>honor to be invited here this evening to<br>Shar in this fantastic experience I'd<br>like to congratulate all those who are<br>graduating on their wonderful<br>achievement earned through what I'm sure<br>was a great deal of hard work and I hope<br>a great deal of fun along the<br>way however I suggest to you that your<br>greatest achievement is not the<br>knowledge and the skills that you have<br>acquired as a result of your journey<br>thus far but the capacity you have<br>developed for learning for the journey<br>ahead as an employer of some 17,000<br>people worldwide about 11,000 of those<br>offshore in our 140 markets around the<br>world it is this capacity for learning<br>combined with creativity adaptability to<br>teamwork a Global Perspective and a<br>drive for results that are critical<br>factors in who fona hires and who we<br>positions personally I've been very<br>fortunate in my career which has<br>certainly provided me with ample<br>opportunity for continuous learning<br>after a brief period in medical research<br>I joined the New Zealand Dairy Research<br>Institute for at the time what I thought<br>was only going to be a couple of years I<br>was postdocking in the UK at the time<br>when my head of Department asked me if I<br>wanted to do an industrial<br>post funded by the New Zealand dairy<br>industry aimed at converting a dairy<br>waste stream into a cocoa butter<br>substitute I had to ask what an<br>industrial postto meant well one thing<br>it meant at the time was a significant<br>increase in my<br>salary when I've been living off the<br>smell of an oily rag and I'm sure<br>there's a lot of you out there would be<br>uh familiar with that position<br>but it was also an opportunity to learn<br>something completely new and<br>different well eventually that brought<br>me to New Zealand and what has been a<br>very rewarding career working in most<br>most aspects of the dairy industry from<br>cow to<br>Consumer at one time I had the privilege<br>of leading the research and development<br>group at the livestock Improvement<br>corporation which as some of you may<br>know supplies over 80% of the bull<br>seamen used for artificial breeding in<br>New Zealand<br>upon starting my job I was provided with<br>my first company car but this was no<br>ordinary car for along the entire length<br>of the back bumper was the image of a<br>sperm I certainly drew a lot of<br>attention pulling up to the traffic<br>lights in that car usually with a big<br>smile on my<br>face within my team at livestock<br>Improvement Corporation with a<br>quantitative geneticist a special breed<br>who through a series of complex<br>algorithms created breeding indices used<br>to select the best Bulls in New Zealand<br>the team had just spent around 5 years<br>developing a new indexing system and I<br>was asked to present this to a group of<br>farmers and a scattering of other<br>quantitative<br>geneticists to prepare for this<br>presentation I got my team to give me a<br>thorough briefing and for one of my team<br>to accompany me to the presentation<br>where he was asked to sit at the back of<br>the<br>venue now before starting this technical<br>presentation I first recall the story of<br>a World leading physicist who was asked<br>to present his latest findings to some<br>of the leading academic institutions in<br>Europe because he was covering so many<br>cities in a limited number of days he<br>was provided with a<br>chauffeur on entering the outskirts of<br>Paris having delivered half a dozen or<br>more of these presentations the<br>physicist mentioned to his chauffer that<br>he was sick of the sound of his own<br>voice and was not at all Keen to give<br>this presentation again the chauffer<br>commented that he'd sat at the back of<br>all the presentations and that he<br>probably knew the presentation off by<br>heart the physicist said let's have some<br>fun give me your hat you jump in the<br>back of the car and they pulled up to<br>the venue at the venue the Shaffer<br>walked up to the front and gave a Word<br>Perfect<br>presentation but at the conclusion the<br>chairman of the session asked for<br>questions another eminent physicist in<br>the audience asked the show for a<br>question which of course he had no idea<br>how to answer<br>but quick witted the chauffer gave the<br>following<br>response sir I cannot believe you've<br>asked me such a rudimentary question as<br>I'm sure even the show My Chauffeur at<br>one and this is true I must say I have<br>had ample opportunity to repeat that<br>very same approach in presentations I've<br>given now returning to the theme of<br>lifelong learning<br>I'm sure I need not mention to you why<br>this is so important in today's<br>everchanging world not only are we<br>creating new knowledge at an Ever<br>quickening rate but often what we had<br>come to understand as fact is also<br>changing by way of example fontera has<br>invested me some many hundreds of<br>millions of dollars in nutrition related<br>research and some tens of millions of<br>dollars of this through our highly<br>successful joint venture with ockland<br>university called lacta<br>pharmer now I know this is an old cliche<br>but the more we learn the more we really<br>realize just how little we knew and with<br>that though the enormous opportunity we<br>had in front of us who would have<br>thought that some of the components in<br>Dairy good old milk when extracted and<br>combined at high concentration would<br>provide a treatment for those people<br>undergoing chemotherapy and we're<br>currently undergoing a global clinical<br>trial in that area with some very<br>promising<br>results the pace of change is<br>accelerating it took radio 38 years to<br>reach 1 million<br>users it took TV 13 years to do the<br>same the internet four years iPod three<br>years with Facebook adding 200 million<br>users in less than a<br>year I also find it fascinating that one<br>in8 married couples in the US met<br>through social<br>thing finally when it comes to your<br>education I'll steal a quote from<br>Winston church and following the Battle<br>of Britain this is not the end or even<br>the beginning of the end it is the end<br>you<br>thank you Dr Hill I think the last time<br>I heard Dr Hill speak I was the director<br>of fontia he was presenting to the board<br>I think he just wanted another 50<br>million or something for the R&amp;D program<br>and he was equally persuasive if I<br>recall correctly there were quite a few<br>people sitting at the back of the<br>room can I ask you to show your<br>appreciation again please for Dr<br>Hill<br>this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the university for a<br>ceremony of conferring degrees and<br>awarding of diplomas at this ceremony<br>the pro- chancellor Ian Parton and I<br>will be conferring degrees and awarding<br>diplomas I now invite the pro Chancellor<br>to award the diplomas and
