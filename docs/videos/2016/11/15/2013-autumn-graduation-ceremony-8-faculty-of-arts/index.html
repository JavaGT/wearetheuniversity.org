University<br>families and<br>friends to our gr graduants who are we<br>are here to acknowledge and celebrate<br>today I'd like to send a heartfelt<br>congratulations to you all you have<br>reached that day which marks an end and<br>a beginning the result of thousands of<br>words read and written lers of sweat and<br>tears spiled and truckloads of caffeine<br>helplessly<br>consumed and that's just your<br>parent it must have been hell for you<br>guys actually sitting your degrees as<br>well for me it is nearly 30 years since<br>I sat where you are today an actual fact<br>my Bachelor of Arts ceremony was in the<br>town hall just across the square because<br>not only were we a smaller fraternity<br>back then this building actually wasn't<br>even<br>built not quite Jurassic more the<br>Cretaceous Period yes we were preg<br>Google pre- cell phone pre- Subway<br>absolutely<br>Unthinkable back in 1984 things were a<br>lot simpler Madonna's Material Girl was<br>on high rotated parties Miami Vice was<br>providing a disturbing satorial template<br>for some males aged under 30 white pants<br>pastel t-shirts curly mullet aviator<br>sunglasses you had to be<br>there and Roger nomic was about to be<br>Unleashed on an unsuspecting electorate<br>that thought it had voted for election<br>government yet despite the differences<br>some things remain depressingly the<br>same such as the way graduating with a<br>Bachelor of Arts can Inspire bemused<br>stairs and even pitying looks from some<br>complete<br>strangers a case in point when I was<br>proudly relating to an acquaintance that<br>my own son had embarked this year on a<br>conjoint babcom he snorted and replied<br>ba huh that's exactly what the world<br>needs another<br>hippie frankly that was the straw that<br>broke the mother camel's<br>back I have finally trained myself out<br>of responding to a query about my own<br>tertiary education with the usual degree<br>oh I only did a<br>ba the time has come my fellow graduan<br>to snatch back the mner of our<br>qualification we need no longer put up<br>with the taunts ba stands for bugger all<br>for me that catch cry now is ba means<br>best allrounder and yes I have the<br>it like many of you I shed The<br>Vocational degrees law engineering and<br>the like and pursued the path less<br>clearly sign posted when I emerged after<br>3 years at ockland University with a ba<br>in English Indonesian including a<br>third-year paper in Javanese history and<br>art history I'll admit my employment<br>opportunities weren't immediately<br>obvious but I strongly believe one of<br>the key reasons I've been asked to speak<br>to you today is to provide clear<br>testimony that even the most obscurely<br>qualified can remain in continuous<br>employment for quite a long period of<br>time more importantly though let's not<br>get too preoccupied with employment as<br>The Logical end product of an<br>education it may seem quaint in this era<br>of inputs and outcomes Pathways and<br>mission statements but let us never<br>forget that education is still and<br>always will be an end and itself you are<br>simply a more complete a more rounded<br>person by being<br>educated more specifically think of the<br>problem facing the world and its<br>societies how can we even begin to solve<br>those problems without an understanding<br>of their Origins well that would be<br>history of how governments work well<br>that would be political studies of other<br>cultures well that would be languages<br>anthropology and<br>sociology and even of what we might<br>aspire to as members of the human race<br>ethically morally and artistically well<br>that would be literature art history and<br>philosophy you see what I'm getting<br>at what I see before me today are the<br>inheritors of the greatest traditions of<br>thought and learning and scholarship<br>without which we would not even qualify<br>as a<br>civilization if your degrees stand for<br>anything it is the ability to critically<br>examine the world you live in to ask the<br>right questions and to be open to<br>answers and information and<br>possibilities that will in whatever<br>small way move us further towards the<br>light and away from the darkness of<br>ignorance and Blind<br>Faith yes they are lofty ideals so you<br>may ask how did it all work out for me<br>well after I took my ba and added a<br>journalism diploma to it I launched<br>myself into the strange unpredictable<br>and exciting world of news media I did<br>eventually land in the T TV business<br>where I have stayed for most of the last<br>three decades and I will be staying for<br>a wee bit<br>longer but whatever the next few decades<br>May hold for you all I know that you<br>face the future enriched by the<br>experience you have had in gaining your<br>hard-earned degree you are a success<br>already from attaining that<br>qualification May that success be<br>multiplied many times over and may your<br>drive and desire to learn be the Legacy<br>that you pass on to those who follow<br>thank you so much much for allowing me<br>to share this very special occasion with<br>you all and above good luck kamu o Teno<br>Teno<br>tenot thank you Carol for most excit<br>insightful and challenging yet<br>entertaining<br>speech can I ask you all to
