welcome with pleasure the<br>speaker for our first graduation<br>ceremony Dr John Matthews companion of<br>the queen service order of New<br>Zealand Dr Matthews brings to this role<br>both academic prowess and a long record<br>of exemplary service to Medicine educ<br>ation the community and this<br>University he played a key role in the<br>establishment of what is now diagnostic<br>Med lab and

the Royal Australian<br>College of of Physicians and the Cancer<br>Society medical advisory committee<br>Matthews tenot ten cotu tenot<br>C Chancellor<br>Vice<br>Chancellor members of council members of<br>the<br>University graduates family and<br>friends it gives me great pleasure to be<br>able to share this very important<br>occasion with you all and particularly<br>those of you graduating<br>today you have set yourself a goal and<br>achieved it and that should have given<br>you a great sense of satisfaction and<br>fulfillment and incidentally it may have<br>Justified ongoing celebrations later<br>today if I have any special claim uh to<br>be addressing you this morning it does<br>relates to the duration of my<br>association with the<br>university uh and which is measured in a<br>significant number of decades something<br>which is a little salutary to me<br>personally I hesitate to mention also uh<br>that my uh duration of studentship with<br>the university commenced uh with papers<br>at the Oakland University College and<br>extended over the next 20 years until my<br>I completed my last postgraduate diploma<br>at then the University of Oakland but<br>don't be disheartened education is an<br>activity the quality and respect for<br>qualif applications for any tertiary<br>institution relate strongly to its<br>standing and the chancellor has already<br>referred to this and this is Bo<br>internationally and nationally and the<br>University of ockland is a clear leader<br>in New Zealand and certainly rates<br>highly<br>overseas such a reputation is not<br>achieved overnight but it's the<br>culmination of many years of planning<br>and commitment by generations of<br>Educators creating a tradition within<br>your University which is in fact<br>jealously guarded and it is some of<br>those people that you have had contact<br>with during your course and degrees and<br>the commitment of those people will have<br>substantially helped you through and you<br>will remember those personalities for<br>come we have a significant number of<br>international student graduates here<br>today and I believe that they and you<br>have all chosen wisely to study here but<br>you as students also bring much to the<br>university and there is a strong<br>symbiosis within the university<br>community teachers researchers<br>administrators students and all those<br>other people who keep the organization<br>functioning this is of course further<br>strengthened uh by the huge diversity of<br>students what I would like to do in the<br>brief remaining time I have available is<br>to look forward not to the univers<br>university but for you as<br>individuals most of you will have<br>believed that higher education is<br>essential for optimizing career<br>opportunities and ensuring a successful<br>and personally fulfilling life<br>but this may be naive and an<br>matters some of you will be going on to<br>further postgraduate studies and a few<br>of you will remain longterm in the<br>institutional academic<br>environment this path can be rewarding<br>but is not everyone's choice and is not<br>always<br>straightforward funding for postgraduate<br>studies is not always always readily<br>available and those searching for<br>postdoctoral positions are often<br>grants those of you returning home to<br>other countries and indeed those of you<br>remaining in New Zealand may have clear<br>plans but many of you will be entering a<br>phase of challenging decision<br>making this challenge is further<br>increased in the current environment of<br>global instability which is having an<br>impact on many previously readily<br>available career<br>opportunities a few weeks ago I happened<br>to be in the Czech Republic visiting a<br>small City on the banks of the ear River<br>dein and the person showing us around<br>the city was an interesting individual<br>who started to reflect on the younger<br>people in the city and the fact that an<br>increasing percentage were proceeding to<br>tertiary<br>qualifications but that at the end of it<br>there was a frustration with lack of<br>career opportunities and for that small<br>City this meant a loss of these<br>important young members of the community<br>to elsewhere in the Czech Republic or in<br>wider Europe so the problem is certainly<br>a global<br>one personal doubts also increase this<br>environment and I'd like to quote qu<br>from comments of a recent graduate in<br>that well-known peer review journal The<br>Listener and I quote it is amazing how<br>five years of tertiary education still<br>result in you knowing essentially<br>nothing in the eyes of prospective<br>employers now this is an attitude I<br>would not like you to take away from<br>today it is true that a move from the<br>University learning environment is a<br>significant step and there is a steep<br>learning<br>curve I will remember my first night on<br>duty as a newly qualified doctor feeling<br>extremely anxious about what telephone<br>calls I may<br>receive but you have received an<br>excellent education and have been taught<br>to think you are well equipped to face<br>the challenges As you move on to the<br>next phase of your life<br>you also have a degree from a university<br>with an outstanding reputation which<br>will stand you in good stead in any<br>competitive employment<br>environment have confidence and enjoy<br>the challenges of the new experiences<br>and<br>learning you will find it stimulating<br>and you will grow<br>personally some of you may pause in<br>examining the path which you are<br>following as indeed I did in that<br>context the learning you have had is<br>never<br>wasted have the courage to examine your<br>Ambitions<br>realistically and if you do change<br>ensure it is for the right<br>reasons the greatest reward your<br>education can give you is a fulfilling<br>life with a balance between Career<br>Success personal growth and personal<br>relationships you all have that<br>potential so do see it with both<br>hands in closing I would like to quote<br>some words of the Irish poet and clite<br>William Butler Yates and he<br>says education is not the filling of the<br>well thank you Dr Matthews um for some<br>very uh wise Council to our graduates<br>laced I suspect with some strong<br>personal experience can I ask
