critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>cheers The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities such as ours is<br>not well<br>understood our Innovative research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social<br>cohesion never more so than in the<br>testing Economic Times we face in the<br>recession universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private philanthropy not<br>less but

welcome as our speaker at this<br>evening's ceremony Dr Nigel<br>Evans Dr Evans is an<br>of our<br>university has attended Harvard Business<br>School and is currently a director of<br>Fisher and P<br>Healthcare he brings to this role both<br>academic prowess and a wealth of<br>business experience at the highest<br>level after graduating from the<br>University of Oakland with a master of<br>science degree Dr Evans gained a<br>doctorate in particle physics from the<br>University of<br>Cambridge on returning from the UK he<br>joined what was then a startup company<br>New Zealand steel with responsibility<br>for its<br>technology and product<br>quality there he led the development of<br>the first successful process for the<br>production of Steel from Iron sand n<br>yado<br>Cole 25 years ago he formed his own<br>company quak technology which<br>specializes in Iron and Steel<br>Technologies<br>Dr Evans is also Secretary of the wol<br>Fisher trust established to support and<br>send Secondary School principles and<br>teachers on overseas study<br>trips this trust now supports many other<br>educational initiatives including the<br>wolf Fisher Research Center at our<br>University please welcome Dr Nigel Evans<br>Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor members of council members of<br>the<br>University<br>gradu families and<br>friends this is a grand evening of<br>ceremony and<br>celebration to honor you graduate of<br>education and Engineering from the<br>University of Oakland New Zealand's<br>preeminent<br>University I am privileged to be here<br>tonight to offer you our heartiest<br>congratulations on your Splendid<br>individual and Collective<br>achievements you would be the first to<br>acknowledge the support and<br>encouragement you have received from<br>your families relatives and Friends your<br>lectur is at University and your<br>teachers at<br>school many of these special people are<br>here tonight quite rightly to share in<br>your<br>achievements let me thank them all most<br>sincerely on your<br>behalf while at<br>University you will have mastered the<br>main elements of your<br>subjects learned to think and work<br>independently rounded your<br>personalities by interaction with others<br>from different backgrounds and<br>cultures and developed confidence in the<br>uniqueness of this country's history and<br>communities above all I trust you will<br>have discovered the joy of study and the<br>pleasure that results from sustained<br>effort most of you will leave this Hall<br>tonight impatient to get on with your<br>careers full of excitement at the<br>prospects but quite naturally tinged<br>with a bit of<br>apprehension your choice of<br>professions tells me that you will<br>measure your future<br>success not by how much money you will<br>make but by the difference you will make<br>in the lives of<br>others we applaud your<br>decisions as both education and<br>progress many years ago I was at the<br>same Waypoint in my<br>career after graduating from this<br>University I won a scholarship to<br>Cambridge where I received a document a<br>doctorate in elementary particle<br>physics it seemed I was headed for<br>research probably in the US or the<br>UK but by luck a new Direction opened up<br>for me soon after my<br>graduation wolf fiser had just persuaded<br>the New Zealand government that a new<br>process which could make steel from<br>irons sand was worth wory of commercial<br>support and ever since a fifth form<br>chemistry class I had silently wondered<br>why all attempts to turn iron sand into<br>steel going back nearly 100 years had<br>failed so I jumped at the opportunity to<br>come back to New Zealand Steel in South<br>Oakland with the responsibility to<br>responsibility to commission and then<br>enhance this new technology<br>this was a huge change in the direction<br>of my career but one which I embraced<br>enthusiastically so you can imagine that<br>I was shaken when it soon became clear<br>that the plant could indeed produce<br>steel but only at about a quarter of the<br>planned production<br>rate the big question then was what to<br>do next to save the<br>company the two large overseas companies<br>which had developed the failed process<br>were of little<br>help they wanted to add costly equipment<br>using money which we didn't have and<br>with no guarantee of<br>success there is not time tonight to<br>detail the solution that we<br>found let me just say that a small team<br>of young<br>graduates by experimenting on the<br>producing plant over a period of 5 years<br>developed a simple process that has<br>underpinned the company's subsequent<br>success other International steel makers<br>still rate iron sand as an undesirable<br>iron ore because of its low iron content<br>small particle size and high<br>concentration of<br>titanium and yet<br>perversely the new process we developed<br>works well only because of these<br>factors we turned iron Sand's apparent<br>negatives<br>into resounding<br>positives here are a few lessons which I<br>learned from these turbulent years which<br>you may find helpful along your<br>way<br>first have the confidence to change the<br>direction of your career to seize<br>exciting<br>opportunities work is far more<br>satisfying when you are stimulated by a<br>challenge and if you do change<br>Fields you will see the new landscape<br>through different<br>lenses<br>second don't be constrained by<br>conventional wisdoms when obstacles<br>block your<br>way challenge those who say that<br>something cannot be<br>done look for The Simple Solutions which<br>turn problems into<br>opportunities perhaps by redefining the<br>rules analyze problems<br>logically using the toolkit you possess<br>as a result of your academic study<br>so always be vigilant for the<br>discontinuous<br>improvements these are the ones which<br>make the real<br>differences third learn to work as a<br>team<br>member don't be afraid to gather around<br>you those of Greater<br>intellect even Einstein needed help from<br>his student friends who are better<br>mathematicians no one can live long<br>enough<br>error very soon each of you will be<br>crossing the<br>stage it will be a fleeting moment of<br>public recognition of your<br>achievement but the degree you receive<br>will be a permanent and valued<br>possession on life's<br>journey along the way you will again<br>need the support and advice from many<br>others let me remind you that there is<br>something small and precious that each<br>of you can give in<br>return the two words thank<br>you they may even lift your early career<br>from mediocrity to<br>success so<br>tonight go forth as proud graduates with<br>our very best<br>wishes each of you has an opportunity to<br>well thank you Dr Evans for those<br>inspiring and wise<br>observations based<br>obviously on deep personal experience<br>can I ask you again to show your<br>this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the University at which<br>the pro Chancellor Ian Parton and I will<br>be conferring degrees on awarding<br>diplomas I invite the pro

raising<br>awareness of how gender Prejudice can<br>shape adolescent outcomes<br>and in OB centure all those other<br>persons named in the book of convocation<br>qualified for the confir of a doctoral<br>degree<br>on behalf of the University I now invite<br>all today's graduates to stand and<br>receive the congratulations of us all<br>and and this this would be this would be<br>an ideal opportunity for the graduates<br>to show their appreciation of their<br>families and supporters and the staff of<br>the<br>Chancellor council members distinguished<br>guests graduates families and friends of<br>graduates and of the university<br>university colleagues the celebration of<br>graduation is a major event in the<br>calendar of the University it is also a<br>minor miracle of organization that we<br>manage to repeat at least twice a year<br>the university salutes all the graduates<br>who make it possible for us to celebrate<br>your<br>success a successful graduation means we<br>must ensure that all the ceremonies<br>proceed smoothly that means checking<br>results communicating with some<br>2,984 students who in total have<br>received<br>3,074 degrees in diplomas today more<br>than 2,000 students have crossed the<br>stage during today's<br>celebrations not only have 307 of you<br>gained two qualifications today seven<br>have gained three qualifications and two<br>have gained four qualifications it is<br>quite an exercise and some of you have<br>been<br>busy on your behalf I would like to<br>thank those who have made graduation not<br>only possible but hopefully an occasion<br>you will remember with pleasure and so<br>our thanks go to many people and many<br>groups to the ockland grammar school<br>pipe band which provides the music for<br>our procession to the town hall the<br>organist John worlds who has played at<br>each ceremony the musicians from our<br>school of music who have provided<br>musical items at each ceremony the four<br>graduation speakers each with an<br>appropriate message members of the<br>University Council busy people who make<br>time to join us for this special<br>occasion the fire karanga team who<br>perform the karanga that welcomes<br>everyone to each ceremony the Kate edga<br>educational trust which provides many of<br>the ceremonial caps gowns and hoods and<br>Dev any profits it makes to fund<br>scholarships for future students the<br>staff of the AR Center the staff who<br>taught you and made your graduation<br>possible the staff will organize and<br>officiate at graduation and ensure that<br>nearly everyone arrives at the right<br>place at the right time the mace bearers<br>Professor Louise Nicholson and Dr<br>Douglas carry the role of the mace<br>Bearer is to escort and protect the<br>official party hence the<br>mace behind the scenes are staff of the<br>graduation office managed by Margaret<br>Allen they complete all the paperwork<br>required for each student who graduates<br>they ensure the ceremonies run to time<br>they slot those arriving late into their<br>correct seats and they have worked long<br>hours over the last few weeks to make<br>sure that everyone feels that graduation<br>is a special day and so on your behalf<br>we thank and particular the graduation<br>team for their<br>dedication and finally we must thank our<br>Chancellor Roger France and<br>pro-chancellor Ian Parton between them<br>they have shaken over 2,000 hands today<br>spoken to each graduate and been greeted<br>and photographed in numerous ways the<br>chancellor has also prepared and<br>delivered four welcome<br>speeches this is the last graduation<br>ceremony over which our present<br>Chancellor Roger France will preside as<br>he retires at Chancellor at the end of<br>the year having served the university on<br>its Council for 12 years he has spent<br>four years in the role of Chancellor and<br>his contributions to this graduation<br>ceremony will be greatly missed during<br>his terms as Chancellor he has seen some<br>38,000 students graduate from the<br>University he probably deserves a rest<br>and so can I ask you to join me in<br>thanking all of our graduation team and<br>staff but particularly our Chancellor<br>the vice Chancellor no sits his uh<br>review<br>tomorrow this concludes this meeting of<br>of council and convocation of the<br>university for the confirmative degrees<br>and the award of diplomas I now invite<br>you to sing the first verse of God<br>defend New Zealand in Mari and then in<br>English the words are printed on the<br>reverse of your programs<br>he<br>God of<br>Nations at my<br>feet in the BS of love we<br>me he our<br>voices we<br>inre God of<br>defend our<br>fre<br>land<br>lord<br>trip shs of stri and<br>War make our<br>our Def and you feel</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
