and<br>to create a full and satisfying life for<br>new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>projects scholarships and professorial<br>chairs The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities such as ours is<br>not well<br>understood our Innovative research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social<br>cohesion never more so than in the<br>difficult times New Zealand faces in the<br>wake of the recession and the two Christ<br>j<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private

anglicans<br>calling her an influential voice an<br>Anglican liberal Circle<br>par Chancellor<br>Chancellor members of council members of<br>the<br>University gradu families and friends<br>warm greetings on this singularly<br>auspicious occasion for us all I am<br>deeply privileged by this<br>invitation I stand before you all as an<br>immensely proud distinguished alumna of<br>this my beloved University of<br>Oakland As i gaze out at those<br>of you now simply so anxious to walk<br>across the stage I am filled with<br>Nostalgia as I recall my own first<br>experience of<br>graduation there I sat where all of you<br>undergraduates are with your very cute<br>little fur lined academic<br>hoods I was feeling then as I imagine<br>many of you now are impatient to<br>graduate hugely relieved and yet still<br>somewhat incredulous that this deserved<br>moment has finally<br>come doubt filled about whether or not<br>one has the intellectual rigor to go on<br>anxiety filled wondering about whether<br>or not one can afford to go<br>on please don't be dissuaded by anyone<br>or anything you can and you must go on<br>if indeed you feel the vocational call<br>of the<br>academy to those of you now privileged<br>postgraduate degrees I salute your<br>tenacity your sacrifices and now your<br>well earned<br>congratulations beyond the<br>understandable introspection you are all<br>doubtless<br>experiencing there was surrounding me as<br>I know is true for almost all of you an<br>outpouring of hugely import deeply<br>affectionate irrepressible Pride from<br>those to whom you each matter so much<br>even a cursory glance around the center<br>now filled with the absolutely adoring<br>Smiles of your family and friends is<br>testimony to the abundance of personal<br>affection and pride of which I<br>speak all of you about to be conferred<br>degrees will be invited later in this<br>award ceremony to offer your love ones<br>your own tribute and rightly so for none<br>of us ever succeeds alone even though we<br>journey often through what feel like<br>places of profound<br>aloneness there are other university<br>based professional groups to whom<br>generous tributes are also due for they<br>too comprise the totality of the great<br>cloud of witnesses to your academic<br>success I invite you to notice the<br>highly skilled Librarians and<br>researchers who have guided and advised<br>you and then all of the hardworking<br>administrative staff who have assisted<br>you over the years and finally and<br>perhaps most importantly there are these<br>all of my professional academic friends<br>and colleagues on the stage behind me<br>for whom I will dare to speak in on just<br>in just a<br>moment may I briefly then on your behalf<br>offer your grateful acknowledgement to<br>all of the workers in the University's<br>metaphoric<br>Vineyard let me turn then to the reason<br>why we as your professional academic<br>friends and colleagues are so especially<br>proud of you put quite simply it is<br>because each and every one of you now as<br>a graduate of this<br>University represents to us and to The<br>Wider Society a sign of of profound<br>hope it is a hope that you will now<br>recognize that your graduation Accords<br>you both a deserved<br>reputation and an officially authorized<br>capacity for reasoned and thus rational<br>intellectual discourse and subsequent<br>action this reputation and capacity both<br>positions and obligates you to join all<br>other intellectuals in the ongoing task<br>and resp<br>responsibility of endeavoring to<br>positively and productively influence<br>the Public Square to be bold Innovative<br>imaginative creative and compassionate<br>thinkers and contributors to the<br>betterment of the social economic<br>political and spiritual circumstances of<br>all in the societies within which you<br>will find your future<br>careers in summary then we are proud of<br>you as graduates because we see in you<br>now the potential as wonderfully well<br>educated people to make your individual<br>contributions through the academic<br>disciplines in which you have excelled<br>in Myriad different<br>ways to the betterment of the Civil<br>societies to which you each belong<br>whether here in Alo New Zealand or<br>Beyond in the global Villages from which<br>many of you have<br>come in order however for your<br>contributions to be truly and enduringly<br>effective there is need for you to<br>recognize that intellectual Excellence<br>is but a portion of what is<br>needed the remaining portion if you like<br>has to do with the reflected presence of<br>those often less treasured human<br>qualities of compassion of kindness of<br>respect indeed of civic-minded virtue<br>for as Wendel Berry reminds<br>us the thing being made in a university<br>is<br>Humanity for what publicly supported<br>universities are mandated to make or<br>help to make is human beings in the<br>fullest sense of those words not just<br>trained workers or knowledgeable<br>citizens but responsible ears and<br>members of human<br>societies your relationship therefore<br>with the university does not and ought<br>not end today rather to quote a former<br>president of the University of<br>Colorado graduation does not mean the<br>breaking of ties and the beginning of<br>Life<br>apart rather it marks your initiation in<br>the fullest sense into the Fellowship of<br>the<br>University as bearers of her torch as<br>centers of her influence as promoters of<br>her spirit<br>by way of underscoring this poignant and<br>enduring Invitational reminder I'm sure<br>that many of you were as affected as I<br>was by the words of the bishop of London<br>as he spoke to the newlyweds Kate and<br>William last Friday allow me to<br>paraphrase ever so slightly the bishop<br>said we stand looking forward to a<br>century which is full of promise and<br>full of<br>peril we shall not be converted to the<br>promise of the future by more knowledge<br>alone but also by an increase of loving<br>wisdom and reverence for life for the<br>Earth and for one<br>another his message was I believe<br>profoundly important as I invite you to<br>contemplate with me the extent to which<br>in our increasingly complex contemporary<br>Society depersonalized forms of<br>communication now too often masquerade<br>as<br>ation and where opportunity for simple<br>intimate acts of human kindness are<br>subsequently either able to be avoided<br>or their occasions are often so<br>tragically<br>reduced we are I believe all at<br>continued risk of diminishing the<br>quality of our human relationships<br>unless we commit to finding ways of<br>reordering our priorities as<br>irredeemably social spiritual mutually<br>interdependent human<br>beings human beings who are always<br>instinctively protective and nurturing<br>of the World created and entrusted into<br>our care and who are always<br>instinctively drawn to other human<br>beings for company for Solace for<br>sustenance for shelter and for sharing<br>in the Sweet Taste of<br>success we here in this Alo New Zealand<br>part of the global Community are<br>privileged Beyond imagining in so many<br>ways in terms of the Civil Society we<br>enjoy ours is one where reasonable<br>descent is appropriately enabled ours is<br>one within which that rightly contested<br>concept of Tolerance is nonetheless<br>promoted where human rights are<br>guaranteed and ours is one within which<br>pluralism finds a rightfully pragmatic<br>response ours is a society known<br>globally for its open and generally<br>egalitarian moral and political<br>climate a strong confident and Humane<br>intellectual class is necessary for the<br>maintenance and strengthening of such a<br>nurturing and free Society one in which<br>all the citizens are unable to<br>participate and to contribute with<br>unfettered freedom and<br>generosity the same prerequisite is so<br>for all Societies in the international<br>sphere tragically<br>such is not always the<br>casee my own work in the international<br>realm over the past two decades or so<br>has exposed me to some of the worst<br>outcomes of the breakdown of civil<br>Societies in places such as Rwanda Sri<br>Lanka the Congo Kenya the Solomon<br>Islands and for the longest period I<br>have been involved in the seemingly<br>intractable situation between Israel and<br>Palestine in fact I am just back this<br>very morning from an Extended Stay in<br>the West Bank working in heon and in the<br>arub refugee<br>camp while it would be utterly<br>irresponsible of me to exploit this<br>moment in terms of venturing a personal<br>view of this last extremely complex<br>political<br>situation what I will say is that I am<br>even more firmly of the belief that what<br>is tragically lacking in this and in a<br>number of the other troubled Middle<br>Eastern countri countries currently<br>experiencing extreme political turmoil<br>are the more judicious voices of those<br>blessed with astute intellect with<br>penetrating and yet compassionate<br>analysis those with political seacity<br>and spiritual<br>wisdom all of the culturally Universal<br>human qualities and capacities which<br>university education ultimately<br>affords it is following on from this<br>assertion and as my own professional<br>experience attests becoming more and<br>more possible and indeed I believe<br>urgently desirable for many more of us<br>to develop skills and<br>sensitivities which enable us to be<br>effective boundary<br>crosses as one whose own scholarship<br>remains concerned with advocating for<br>the rights of All Peoples especially<br>minorities to have their lifegiving and<br>a life sustaining cultural traditions<br>deeply respected and deeply honored I<br>remain simultaneously insistent about<br>the need for invoking Fearless critique<br>of many of the previously trenchant<br>internal boundaries of ethnic class and<br>religious differences with an eye to<br>exposing their embedded<br>injustices I do not agree that the task<br>of advocacy for or critique of is even<br>arguably the sole Preserve of members of<br>minority groups<br>themselves as a simple Theologian I<br>propose that either we are our sisters<br>brothers and Keepers or we are<br>not as a simple academic I propose that<br>single identity politics is probably one<br>of the most dangerously unexamined<br>ideological forces abroad in civil<br>societies across the<br>world in other words I consider it<br>theologically and thus morally<br>indefensible for me to say I couldn't<br>possibly have anything to say on behalf<br>of any victim in any society simply<br>because they did not look like think<br>like or speak like me I so yearn for the<br>day when the rigidly invoked boundaries<br>of difference can no longer be held<br>captive by The Insider purists who would<br>unreasonably insist that their cultural<br>particularity in and of itself utterly<br>prudes soal Outsider<br>critique in virtually all instances of<br>especially aggressive rejection of<br>Outsider critique there resides inherent<br>authoritarian protectionism and thus the<br>likelihood of embedded Injustice within<br>the group<br>itself my challenge therefore to you all<br>as graduates is to imagine ways in which<br>you might now use the gift of your<br>academic degree for the betterment not<br>only of the Civil Society within which<br>you are now set to find your life and<br>being but possibly beyond that into the<br>global<br>sphere to what extent might you now take<br>courage in knowing you have both the<br>reputation and the capacity for<br>influencing the Public Square not only<br>in your Homeland but potentially those<br>Beyond to what extent might you now be<br>cognizant of human suffering not only in<br>your own Homeland but also potentially<br>Beyond its<br>Shores and what of the Myriad injustices<br>which give rise to human suffering<br>surely you would not now insist that<br>these are not part of your<br>portfolio to what extent might you now<br>be bold and charitable in your ongoing<br>intellectual<br>Endeavors having in mind that the common<br>good for all in our societies is one<br>hugely dependent upon those with the<br>ability to coales the life of the mind<br>to give together with a deep ARA for all<br>of life indeed for all created<br>beings now these I know are huge<br>questions and possibly way too daunting<br>for this very moment but right now as<br>one of you as your sister graduate of<br>this our University of Oakland I feel I<br>would be utterly remiss if I didn't<br>challenge you to consider the most<br>radical of future possibilities for your<br>eles even as<br>simultaneously and with very very deep<br>sincerity and pride I stand before you<br>in closing to wish you every possible<br>blessing of Happiness as you so<br>deservedly now tun to formly<br>participate in this your very special<br>day of graduation of graduation let me<br>say again
