this is It's one<br>that you will always remember<br>this is a proud day for those of you who<br>have graduated and for your<br>families you have worked hard to get to<br>this<br>ceremony your families have supported<br>you and for them too there is a great<br>sense of<br>achievement you owe a debt of gratitude<br>to your families many of whom will have<br>sacrificed to enable you to achieve the<br>degrees that we celebrate today<br>some of you will be going on to further<br>study here or in other<br>countries some of you will be returning<br>to your home countries where the<br>education you have received here will<br>enable you to make a special<br>contribution to the land of your<br>birth you have graduated from one of the<br>world's great<br>universities you should be proud of<br>that so this is a time too to celebrate<br>your teachers your lecturers your<br>professors they have passed their<br>knowledge onto<br>you you now have the responsibility<br>responsibility to use that knowledge to<br>the best Advantage not just of<br>yourself but also of the communities in<br>which you live and<br>1959 it was the University of New<br>Zealand then actually not the University<br>of Oakland which hadn't at that stage<br>been<br>formed I still remember the day with<br>pride and happiness but one thing that I<br>have learned is that graduation is just<br>a<br>start indeed in many respects it is just<br>the start of the real learning that<br>needs to be undertaken to progress a<br>career<br>as I look back on my legal career I can<br>draw some lessons which I think are<br>worth passing<br>on first as I said a moment ago<br>graduation whilst an achievement in<br>itself is really just the start of an<br>ongoing learning process which will or<br>should continue for the rest of your<br>life that is something to look forward<br>to and celebr<br>celebrate as you enter a<br>career or go on to further<br>education you will find yourself<br>surrounded by smart people who will<br>challenge you to lift your<br>challenge next true happiness comes from<br>helping<br>others always spare time to listen to<br>others and be responsive to their<br>needs you will be surprised to find how<br>often later in life what seems to you to<br>be a small thing done for others turns<br>out to have been very important in their<br>lives what you say or what you do can<br>have a very real impact on the future of<br>other<br>people it's harder to be kind than to be<br>clever cleverness is a<br>gift kindness is a choice and in the end<br>we are our<br>choices help others to achieve and they<br>will take you with<br>them just making money will never<br>provide true satisfaction it's what you<br>important next<br>if you find that what you are<br>doing has become so stressful that you<br>are unhappy in your work don't be afraid<br>to move<br>on it's important to have the courage to<br>do this even at the loss of the<br>temporary security of the position you<br>are<br>in it is of the utmost importance to a<br>good life to be engaged in something you<br>are passionate about that makes you want<br>to get up in the morning<br>it is not living a long life that is<br>important but living each day well and<br>fully a wise man<br>said make the small decisions with your<br>heart challenge<br>yourself the only limits that really<br>matter are those you place on<br>yourself take opportunity and risks the<br>regrets in life are the choices turned<br>down because you thought them too<br>hard 20 years from now you will be more<br>disappointed by the things you didn't do<br>than those you<br>did I have found that great satisfaction<br>comes from accepting a challenge in<br>respect of which I have had doubts about<br>my<br>abilities and then rising to that<br>challenge and to a new level level of<br>Life Professor Richard Florida of the<br>University of Toronto of whom I'm sure<br>some of you have heard describes people<br>like you as the creative<br>class those who are the key driving<br>force for economic development in po<br>industrial<br>cities and the creative class he says<br>and many agree with him is vital in<br>today's global<br>economy so take the opportunity to dream<br>and create the<br>future you are truly on the brink of a<br>great<br>adventure you have been absorbing the<br>wisdom of the past and the present to<br>build for the<br>future but for today celebrate what you<br>have achieved<br>I wish you every success and happiness<br>as you go boldly forward into

seven years the current<br>strength of the mors wilin Center is a<br>national scientific ific Center of<br>Excellence is in no small way a tribute<br>to his expert<br>stewardship at the time of Mr Faulkner's<br>appointment to what was then the center<br>for molecular biodiscovery there was<br>little guidance as to how such centers<br>of research Excellence then a new<br>government initiative should be managed<br>the situation required wise and<br>thoughtful guidance to allow the center<br>to develop in a way that gave the<br>investigators room to pursue goals of<br>scientific Excellence while at the same<br>time maintaining a strategic eye on<br>changing government priorities and<br>societal<br>expectations during this initial setup<br>phase for the center Mr Faulkner and<br>provided invaluable clear advice and<br>oversight to the Cent's director and<br>management<br>committee possibly his most critical<br>contribution to the center came early in<br>2007 when the existing centers of<br>research Excellence were required to<br>compete for a further six-year period of<br>funding<br>here Mr Faulkner was of enormous value<br>as a sounding board for the then<br>director distinguished Professor Ted<br>Baker as he prepared his presentation<br>for the site visit most importantly when<br>he was asked for his views on the center<br>by the site visit panel Mr Faulkner<br>delivered such an authoritative analysis<br>of its place in the New Zealand scene<br>that this was certainly a key factor in<br>ensuring that the morus Wen Center was<br>selected for a further six years of<br>funding and at a significant l enhanced<br>level since then his continued input to<br>the center has helped it to evolve<br>further in directions that will enhance<br>its
