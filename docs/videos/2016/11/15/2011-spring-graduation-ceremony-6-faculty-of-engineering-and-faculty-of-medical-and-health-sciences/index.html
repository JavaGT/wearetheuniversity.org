spring graduation ceremony for<br>2011 of the University of Oakland<br>this week the university is bestowing a<br>total of<br>278 qualifications on some<br>2,450<br>students at this ceremony degrees will<br>be conferred and diplomas awarded in the<br>faculties of<br>engineering and medical and Health<br>Sciences a total of 292 in person plus a<br>Absentia I am privileged as Chancellor<br>to preside at Spring graduation for a<br>third<br>year the regularity of graduation<br>ceremonies makes them no less special<br>for the University and me personally<br>than for those of you being capped here<br>today many for the first<br>time it is also a pleasure to return to<br>the Oakland Town Hall long our<br>traditional graduation venue for the<br>first time since<br>2009 the AER Center which we now use has<br>been temporally captured<br>purposes graduation is a festive event<br>rich in history PP and color with a<br>lively array of contemporary touches<br>here in Oakland our Rich mix of cultures<br>and ethnicities can be seen in the<br>Striking variety of dress and adornments<br>graduan today is one of hard earn<br>Celebration by you the GR an and<br>diplomates on your academic<br>accomplishments and by your family and<br>friends who have encouraged and<br>supported you and are here to share in<br>your<br>success the university represented by<br>the council and academic staff members<br>seated behind me and those many staff<br>who control proceedings with remarkable<br>Precision takes equal pleasure at this<br>hugely significant day for each and<br>every one of<br>you the University of Oakland is<br>deservedly ranked as one of the best<br>universities in the<br>world your qualifications will always<br>serve you well in this country and<br>abroad whether in qualifying you for a<br>satisfying career or in leading to more<br>advanced<br>study or simply as a root to personal<br>and intellectual<br>enrichment in today's everchanging<br>Workforce you cannot afford to stop<br>learning so please keep in mind our<br>opportunities I urge you as alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading University always<br>to remember your Elma mat we depend<br>increasingly on our graduates for<br>support moral and political as well as<br>Financial your advocacy and influence<br>are vital and encouraging government and<br>the community at large to fund<br>universities so they can generate the<br>knowledge needed to drive a productive<br>and competitive economy and to create<br>full and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>projects scholarships and professorial<br>cheers The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities is not well<br>understood and therefore insufficiently<br>acknowledged it it is inconceivable that<br>a developed Progressive 21st century<br>Nation can maintain that status without<br>strong internationally recognized<br>research-based universities such as the<br>University of<br>Oakland our Innovative research is vital<br>for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social cohesion never more so<br>than in the testing times we face in the<br>wake of the global recession and now the<br>devastating Christ Church Earth<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private philanthropy not<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing this<br>institution for today is unquestionably<br>your day I conr congratulate you and<br>trust that you will long cherish<br>2011 our speaker at this final ceremony<br>is guarant Martin the Chief Executive<br>Officer of Count's Monaco District<br>Health Board since December<br>2006 the dhb services a population of<br>over<br>450,000 with many socioeconomic<br>challenges a diverse ethnic mix and a<br>young<br>population Mr Martin came to this role<br>from the Welsh assembly government where<br>he was director of Health and Social<br>care<br>strategy he has managed many levels of<br>service provision in both primary and<br>secondary care including more than 20<br>years experience in Health<br>Management he held the chief executive<br>role at kering General Hospital in<br>northamptonshire and Senior executive<br>positions in London and Birmingham<br>hospitals<br>Mr Martin studied modern history of the<br>University of Wales and also has a<br>master's degree in management and health<br>policy from the University of Birmingham<br>he is a member of The Institute of<br>directors on The Advisory Board of the<br>New Zealand Center for social Innovation<br>and On The Board of Trustees of the<br>ockland filmonia Orchestra Mr Martin<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor uh members of<br>the council members of the University<br>graduan friends and family um Kiora<br>toafa ni and from where I'm from<br>Pand which is Welsh and you know how<br>satisfying is me to be able to put samon<br>and Welsh in the same sentence after<br>last<br>Sunday and not having a collective<br>nervous breakdown as a<br>result and now how bad people feel in<br>New Zealand when the All Blacks go out<br>of the World Cup and I I remember what<br>happened in 2007 that's what you feel<br>like I feel like that all of the time<br>being<br>wor it's a huge pleasure today to be<br>asked to join what's a huge and<br>fantastic achievement by by the gradu in<br>this room and also for the families<br>because on that time it's actually<br>represents a crescendo a completion of a<br>huge amount of help support the family<br>Foo have put into making sure that today<br>actually happens and I remember from my<br>own graduation what an incredibly proud<br>moment it was to myself and my family uh<br>when I did<br>graduate so thank you for asking me to<br>come and speak today and and what I want<br>to talk about is something that will<br>affect all of us whether or not you work<br>in health or whether or not you you you<br>are receiving uh health care because<br>actually what we're facing at the moment<br>in health care is a challenge of a<br>generation and what I mean by that is<br>that we're facing huge demographic<br>changes um in in our population uh we're<br>seeing the Baby Boomers come finally of<br>age or come finally into old age as we<br>begin to retire in fact all the people<br>on the stage are baby boomers so as<br>they're<br>moving thanks well some of as they and<br>as they're moving through now actually<br>they're beginning to retire and actually<br>what's happening that's leading to a<br>significant increase in demand cuz we<br>all know they're very demanding people<br>but also what we're seeing actually is a<br>significant aging of our population<br>which means to say that people are<br>living with disease for a lot longer we<br>can do more we can treat more we can<br>keep people healthy for a lot<br>longer in the start of the 20th century<br>the average life expectancy was around<br>about 47 if you came from the UK and and<br>actually now in most the developed<br>countries indeed many countries it's up<br>into the 80s of a child being born today<br>in fact that story of the the child<br>child is being born today who live to be<br>120 130 was seeing people living longer<br>the problem is you don't live longer at<br>25 you live another 50 years at 75 with<br>all the attendant problems that that<br>brings and what it also means with more<br>and more people retiring is it means the<br>burden on you guys in terms of earning<br>the money and paying the tax to keep us<br>well in our retirement is actually going<br>up so can I actually thank you in<br>advance for working so hard to get<br>qualifications in order that we can<br>continue to live the life that we would<br>like to have the challenge really<br>however it's Tech is not really<br>technical uh it's actually much of it is<br>behavioral and how we actually interact<br>with our Health Care Systems because<br>increasingly what we're worried about is<br>our ability to maintain Universal Health<br>Care for everybody as that burden comes<br>on so actually what I want to talk about<br>for a moment is that we are in an edge<br>of a<br>revolution the first Revolution we went<br>through in healthcare was things up<br>Public Health when we learned that good<br>sewers um proper water supply and good<br>Public Health actually eradicated<br>diseases like cholera sadly in in lots<br>of places we still haven't finished that<br>Revolution yet but actually in countries<br>like New Zealand we have and the last<br>century was all about a second<br>revolution in healthcare being able to<br>have operations and and and and Drug<br>developments were able to keep you well<br>and healthy for a lot longer hence the<br>incre Improvement in life<br>expectancy but now we're in the midst of<br>a third revolution in healthcare as<br>actually what happens is the pattern of<br>demand Upon Us changes as we live longer<br>and live longer with disease that means<br>how people access and use Health<br>Services is beginning to<br>change and actually part of that is all<br>going to be defined by how we're going<br>to improve quality how we're going to<br>deal with inequalities and how<br>importantly we're going to deal with<br>something called Knowledge Management<br>because the amount of knowledge that we<br>now have about medicine is growing<br>exponentially if you trained in the<br>1980s actually what you learned in the<br>1980s is a very small proportion now of<br>what you need to learn to be a competent<br>clinician and I blame a lot of that on<br>the internet in terms of the exchange of<br>information and to show the impact<br>something that the internet has had<br>first of all can I say it was only 12<br>years ago that I actually sent my first<br>email and I seem to spend most of my<br>time doing that and then also talking to<br>my son the other day when I explained<br>growing up in the UK there were only<br>three TV channels and he said what only<br>three children's TV<br>channels and I said no just three TV<br>channels and they were just in black and<br>white and he looked at me really sadly<br>and said well never mind dad at least<br>internet there are people at heast 14<br>now there's people now thinking about<br>going to univers don't cannot imagine a<br>world without the<br>internet and some like the challenges<br>that we're facing are in many ways<br>simple but hugely profound in my job I<br>think there's only three problems that<br>we need to solve in healthcare to<br>actually resolve the problems that we're<br>facing three very simple problems but<br>they've all got incredibly complex<br>answers the first one is given what we<br>know about the impact on health of<br>diabetes why is it that overweight<br>people don't lose<br>weight I probably include myself in that<br>that the second one is and this is a<br>worry for in particular for for Ian<br>Martin on the stage here why is it that<br>40% of doctors don't wash their hands<br>between<br>patients remember that next time you're<br>in<br>hospital and<br>also an airline crashes every day in<br>Oakland but we do nothing about it cuz<br>when I say that actually are the people<br>coming in contact with the health system<br>today and mistakes being made and their<br>health status being affected as a result<br>adds up every day to the passenger load<br>of a 74 seven jumbo jet but because it's<br>lost in the<br>system we don't seem to do something<br>about it yet it adds up to a huge amount<br>of expenditure a huge amount of pain and<br>actually have somebody have to go<br>through repairing operations as a result<br>what happened is we have divorce risk<br>and from<br>consequences and we see it all around us<br>actually uh in in those of us who<br>smoke um because the reason why people<br>don't wash their hands between patients<br>and why overweight people like me you<br>don't lose weight it's not because I<br>don't recognize the risk is it I just<br>don't think it's going to happen to me<br>today and it's the same with smoking<br>people who smoke know it's bad for them<br>but don't give up because they don't<br>think the cancer is going to happen to<br>them today but the problem is the<br>accretion of all of those non-change of<br>behavior leads people to be at risk and<br>then when you have cancer when you have<br>diabetes it's too late mate the problem<br>behavioral so in the future we'll be<br>working very very differently to begin<br>to address those<br>issues first of all those working<br>Healthcare with a combination of very<br>very Hightech working but some of it<br>will be low Tech and for those smokers<br>by the way saying it's okay I can<br>continue smoking because they'll Venture<br>they'll eventually find a cure for<br>cancer well there was a report out today<br>by the the world Cancer Association<br>which said that only 5% of cancers are<br>actually gen IC 95% of them are caused<br>by behaviors so unfortunately you don't<br>actually have that get out<br>clause we're Al also talking about<br>working with patients in a different way<br>they're almost going to be the<br>co-creators of healthcare you will be<br>the co-creators of your Healthcare in<br>the<br>future because if you're diagnosed with<br>a chronic illness in your 30s you'll<br>probably live with that for 50 years you<br>will become an expert in your own right<br>so actually how we train patients is<br>going to be incredibly important<br>because the last thing you want to have<br>is patients coming in having diagnosed<br>themselves on Wikipedia which happens a<br>great deal you know the number of times<br>I've been talking to doctors and they<br>had complaining of patients coming in<br>saying doctor I've got<br>Anthrax look I've got a print out for<br>the interet no you've got a chest<br>infection no it's Anthrax look actually<br>you know actually how we train patients<br>in the future is going to be very<br>important I think there are roles for<br>institutions like the UN University of<br>Oakland in terms of how we do<br>that the thing is there won't be enough<br>of<br>you there certainly won't be enough of<br>you to keep us going and I think that<br>mean new opportunities in new<br>disciplines will develop but also I<br>think the real impact is going to be<br>around Knowledge Management how do we<br>make sure with a massive expansion of<br>what we do know and what we do know<br>works and what we can know how do we<br>make sure that we keep people up to date<br>we simply can't expect people to do it<br>on their own we have to begin to<br>knowledge uh manage our knowledge and<br>manage and strategize how we actually<br>train<br>people and so a critical component I<br>think of raising to the challenges of<br>tomorrow that are here today in<br>healthcare is making sure that we manage<br>the knowledge and continue to train<br>people in the health system actually on<br>an ongoing career on a career basis so<br>really today I'm afraid I have to say<br>today is not the end of your education<br>it's nearly the start this is the first<br>date that you're on because many of you<br>will continue through through the rest<br>of your lives of continuing tertiary<br>education as you update and and as you<br>expand and develop into different<br>careers so I think it's important<br>however just to take a moment to<br>celebrate your first steps that you've<br>taken and also to take a moment to thank<br>those who have supported you including<br>the<br>bank and also uh those who have taught<br>you even though that may be a very very<br>painful thing to have to admit<br>i' just like to say the future is here<br>you are the future it's probably just<br>not evenly distributed yet but I really<br>do Envy you because you're at the start<br>and I'm sort of just about over<br>halfway because I can see the<br>opportunities in front of you and I wish<br>you well and all the luck uh in the<br>future and can I just thank you now for<br>working so hard to pay your taxes to<br>keep me in my dotage thank you<br>well up to the minute before Mr Martin<br>started speaking I thought I was in an<br>exalted group as a as a baby<br>boomer can I ask you again to show your<br>appreciation to Mr Martin for a very<br>interesting insightful and an<br>this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the university for a<br>ceremony of conferring degrees

it recognizes this by making Awards<br>each year to teachers who have<br>demonstrated excellence in aspects of<br>teaching these awards are contestable<br>across the university and signify a<br>truly Superior<br>achievement an award for sustained<br>excellence and teaching has been made to<br>associate professor Tony Ashton in the<br>school of population health<br>within the faculty of medical and Health<br>Sciences I call upon a student of that<br>faculty elizabeta subpena to read the<br>Ashton I am delighted to speak about<br>associate professor Tony Ashton's<br>Excellence as a university teacher I<br>count myself very fortunate to have been<br>taught and supervisor by Tony and now to<br>work alongside her as a tutor Tony<br>doesn't just teach Health economics she<br>loves Health economics and it shows it<br>shows them the enormous depth of<br>knowledge she has about the subject and<br>the way she's able to present the<br>complexities to students in common sense<br>ways inspiring to take up challenges<br>that are presented for them for most<br>students Health economics is a new field<br>of a new field of study if it weren't<br>for Tony's approach it would be easy to<br>flounder and get lost Tony doesn't let<br>that happen it is hard not to become<br>involved in a class Tony's teaching in<br>large lectures she makes a huge effort<br>to get students talking and small<br>postgraduate<br>settings students are fully involved she<br>gets involvement by skillfully drawing<br>on the real world issues brought to the<br>class by postgraduate students who<br>already work in the health sector or by<br>contextualizing Health economics issues<br>through reference to current debates<br>techniques like these bring the subject<br>to life for students Tony really enjoys<br>teaching and it is clear that she<br>devotes an enormous amount of time and<br>effort to her students always interested<br>in their plans and providing providing<br>them with excellent<br>feedback ask graduates of programs like<br>the master of Public Health to reflect<br>on their time at the University and<br>Ton's name is frequently mentioned as<br>their most outstanding lecturer many of<br>these people credit Tony with setting<br>their interest in the career in health<br>policy this is a mark of an excellent<br>teacher and so it is a pleasure to<br>present Tony Ashton as a worthy<br>on behalf of the University I now invite<br>all today's graduates to stand and<br>and this would be the perfect<br>opportunity for the graduates to show<br>their appreciation of their families and<br>supporters and the staff of the<br>University who have helped them as they<br>achieve their<br>qualifications please be<br>Chancellor C council members<br>distinguished guests graduates families<br>and friends of graduates and of the<br>university university colleagues the<br>celebration of graduation is a major<br>event in the calendar of the University<br>it's also a minor miracle of<br>organization that we manage to repeat at<br>least twice a year the university<br>salutes all graduates who have made it<br>possible for for us to celebrate your<br>success a successful graduation means<br>that we must ensure that all six<br>ceremonies proceed smoothly that means<br>checking results and communicating with<br>some<br>2,450 students who in total Reed 278<br>degrees in diplomas more than 1,800<br>students have crossed the stage over two<br>days of celebrations and so as you can<br>see it is quite an exercise on your<br>behalf therefore I would like to thank<br>those who have made graduation not only<br>possible but undoubtedly an occasion<br>that you will remember with<br>pleasure included in those thanks are<br>the Oakland grammar school pipe band<br>which provides the music for our<br>procession to the town hall the organist<br>James tibbles who has played at each<br>ceremony the musicians from the School<br>of Music Who provided musical items at<br>each ceremony six graduation speakers<br>each with an appropriate message members<br>of the University Council busy people<br>who make time time to join us for this<br>special occasion the fire katanga team<br>who perform the katanga that welcomes<br>everyone to each ceremony the Kate Edgar<br>educational trust which provides many of<br>the ceremonial caps gowns and hoods and<br>any profits that they make from that<br>process are used to fund<br>scholarships the staff of the town hall<br>and the staff who taught you and made<br>your graduation possible represented by<br>my colleagues on the stage here today<br>the staff who organize and officiate at<br>graduation and ensure that nearly<br>everything and nearly everyone arrives<br>at the right place and at the right time<br>the MCE bearers associate professors<br>Corin lock and Gary bisen and Dr Douglas<br>carry the role of the mace Bearer is to<br>escort and protect the official<br>party behind the scenes are the staff of<br>the graduation office managed by<br>Margaret Allen they complete all the<br>paperwork required for each student<br>student who graduates they ensure that<br>the ceremonies run on time they slot<br>those arriving late into their correct<br>seats they even today identified<br>somebody trying to graduate who didn't<br>have a<br>degree I know hard to believe isn't it<br>and they have worked long hours over the<br>last few weeks to make sure that<br>everyone feels that graduation is a<br>special day and so we thank the<br>graduation team for their<br>dedication finally must thank our<br>Chancellor Roger France and our<br>pro-chancellor Ian Parton between them<br>they have shaken almost 2,000 hands this<br>week spoken to each graduate and been<br>greeted and photographed in numerous<br>ways the chancellor has also prepared<br>and delivered six welcome speeches so<br>thank you to all those involved and as<br>always thank you Chancellor<br>and this concludes this meeting of<br>council and convocation of the<br>university for the confirmant of degrees<br>and the award of<br>diplomas I now invite you to sing the<br>first verse of God defend New Zealand in<br>Mari and then in English the words are<br>printed on the reverse of your programs<br>we<br>the May our<br>he God of<br>Nations and thy<br>our voices we<br>Ed God defend<br>of<br>land the sh of<br>and make
