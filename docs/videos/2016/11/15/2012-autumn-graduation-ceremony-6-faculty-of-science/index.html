the faculty of science a total of 457<br>absentia as Chancellor I am privileged<br>to preside at graduation once more the<br>Trice yearly cycle of graduation<br>ceremonies makes them no less<br>significant for the University and me<br>personally than for those of you being<br>kept here today many for the first and<br>only time<br>time graduation is always a festive<br>event rich in history Pomp and color but<br>with some endearing contemporary<br>touches here in Oakland our enviable mix<br>of cultures and ethnicities is evident<br>in the variety of dress and adornments<br>today is one of Celebration hard earned<br>and well deserved by you the graduan and<br>diplomat<br>on your academic Feats and by your<br>family and friends who have encouraged<br>and supported you in good times and in<br>success the university represented by<br>the council and academic staff members<br>seated behind me and those many<br>professional staff who direct<br>proceedings with<br>unaringa isfaction in your hugely<br>the University of Oakland is deservedly<br>ranked as one of the best universities<br>in the<br>world the qualifications bestowed on you<br>today will always serve you well in this<br>country and abroad whether in qualifying<br>you for a fulfilling career or in<br>leading to further challenging study or<br>simply for your own personal and<br>intellectual<br>enrichment in today's world of con<br>Conant and often bewildering change you<br>can never afford to stop learning and<br>honing your skills and<br>capabilities so do keep in mind our ever<br>opportunities the critical role of major<br>research Le universities such as the<br>University of Oakland in Modern Life is<br>not always<br>understood our Cutting Edge research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and Social Development never more<br>so than in these globally uncertain<br>Economic<br>Times universities such as ours equip<br>graduates like you not simply for the<br>jobs of today but for careers not yet<br>imagined the University of Oakland's<br>aspirations for the period ahead and our<br>responses to an increasingly constrained<br>funding<br>environment uh comprehensive and<br>demanding<br>they are taking shape in our draft<br>strategic plan for 2013 to<br>2020 I encourage you to peruse this wide<br>ranging document on our website and let<br>us have your<br>feedback I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University always to<br>remember your Elma<br>Mar we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral and<br>political as well as Financial<br>this at a time when our country's<br>universities received the lowest income<br>per student in the developed<br>World your advocacy and influence are<br>vital in encouraging government and the<br>community at large to fund universities<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive economy and to create full<br>and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders but that's enough for me on<br>the challenges currently facing<br>universities for today is unquestionably<br>your<br>day I warmly congratulate each and every<br>one of you and trust that you will long<br>cherish memories of your graduation in<br>May<br>2012 our speaker at this ceremony is Dr<br>Dean Peterson who is manager research<br>funding at the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand the Royal Society is the body<br>which has been advancing and promoting<br>science technology and the humanities in<br>1867 Dr Peterson was born in the USA<br>receiving his Bachelor of Science and<br>chemistry from Bradley University in<br>Illinois and graduating from Michigan<br>State University with a<br>PhD in chemistry he worked in<br>atmospheric research for 10 years at the<br>jet propulsion laboratory USA and was<br>co-program manager for the upper<br>Nasa from June 1998 to July 2008 Dr<br>Peterson was science strategy manager<br>for Antarctica New Zealand the<br>government organization in charge of<br>Antarctic<br>operations he cheered the international<br>joint committee on Antarctic data<br>management from 2001 to<br>2003 his current role at the Royal<br>Society includes the management of the<br>Marsden fund New Zealand's fundamental<br>Peterson Chancellor Vice Chancellor<br>members of council members of the<br>University graduan families and friends<br>this is a great honor for me to today to<br>speak to you on this incredibly special<br>day when I was first asked to give this<br>speech I began to search the web for<br>inspiration I guess as many graduate<br>students do and I watched a number of<br>very good talks on but I quickly<br>realized that the speech that I would<br>give cannot be someone else's words but<br>my own words from my heart so here we<br>go as you may have guessed my<br>introduction with from my introduction<br>I've lived an interesting life from the<br>Forefront of science to the management<br>of research I've worked with some<br>incredible people and have had many<br>amazing<br>opportunities I'll start with a short<br>story about Discovery talk briefly about<br>leadership and then tell you my little<br>secret to<br>life after getting my PhD and struggling<br>to find a job I landed a post-doctoral<br>position at the jet propulsion<br>laboratory in Pasadena<br>California I'd be working with a world<br>famous scientist named Dr Herbert picket<br>when I showed up for work I was told<br>that I'd be designing a new<br>instrument uh that herb had been funded<br>for a spectrometer to measure hydroxy<br>radical in the atmosphere and that's<br>o I had no idea what I was doing or how<br>to begin this task to complicate things<br>the instrument had to fly in a helium<br>balloon at 40 km above the<br>Earth this meant that the instrument had<br>to withstand temperatures of minus 80<br>degrees CS and very low<br>pressures the good news was that I had a<br>whole year to design and make this thing<br>before we had to fly with a with a group<br>from Harvard<br>University after speaking with herb<br>about the concept I went down to the lab<br>to meet the technician I'd be working<br>with Tim Crawford was his name he met me<br>with a huge smile an even bigger<br>handlebar mustache and a gigantic<br>ponytail I actually thought I was<br>looking at one of the first members of<br>uh Crosby Still's Nash and Young<br>but behind the good looks and probably<br>too many garage bands was the mind of a<br>genius Tim was a wizard with design herb<br>was a master of computer control and<br>spectroscopy and I just had to make it<br>all work so we worked every day that<br>year we spent a lot of nights making and<br>breaking things but the hardest part of<br>the whole design was the movable<br>resonator let me tell you what we were<br>actually trying to do o IAL emits at one<br>particular wavelength and the instrument<br>was supposed to only see that wavelength<br>so our first task was to remove all<br>other light from the detector's view<br>this was done with a series of filters<br>but once you had reduced the light down<br>to a very precise range around that<br>desired wavelength we needed a way of<br>scanning the instrument over that range<br>this is where the movable resonator<br>comes in after doing some calculations<br>we we realized that we needed something<br>to move 50 millions of a meter or 50<br>microns and we had to have control over<br>that to about a half a micron which is<br>about a tenth of a red blood<br>cell so we began to panic at this point<br>the grant we had the grant money in the<br>bank NASA was really excited about the<br>instrument but we only had 6 months left<br>at this point to design and build and<br>fly the instrument so we started to<br>think outside the<br>box we went through a lot of Trials and<br>prototypes 11 to be exact um before we<br>hit a great idea from none from none<br>other than Tim our technician our<br>fabrication expert our local<br>musician the idea was to use a speaker<br>system in feedback to scan the<br>resonator this had the Precision we<br>needed and with a few combinations it<br>finally worked when we finally flew the<br>instrument in Texas that spring it was<br>knocked out of alignment by a forklift<br>right before the balloon launch and the<br>only thing we saw was the Earth<br>but after the first attempt we did<br>succeed to measure o in the stratosphere<br>and confirm some at atmospheric models<br>related to Ozone<br>destruction as you're aware I made the<br>jump from scientist to manager and after<br>10 years at JPL and NASA headquarters I<br>moved to New Zealand to take the role of<br>science strategy manager for the<br>Antarctic program let me take you to the<br>Antarctic into the white world into one<br>of the most beautiful places on<br>Earth in 20 06 I had the privilege to<br>take Sir Edmund Hillary to to his base<br>Scott base we had two TV reporters one<br>print reporter and three camera people<br>with us for a total of seven days this<br>was a recipe for disaster If Ever I saw<br>one we were concerned that the Press<br>would focus on the tabl reporting at<br>Scott base and not the wonderful event<br>that was about to take place we came up<br>with a number of ideas to keep the<br>reporters busy<br>basically and I was base manager at the<br>time and was really happy with the busy<br>agenda that we' put together for the<br>Press so with plenty of day trips<br>scheduled we were ready for the circus<br>to<br>begin on the day the plane arrived there<br>wasn't a cloud in the sky and there<br>wasn't a breeze in the air it was a<br>perfect day in Antarctica and there was<br>s ed with a huge smile and all the<br>energy of a big labador<br>retriever along with SED was the Press<br>Cliff Joiner Mark sainsbury Tim panker<br>the first day was spent with briefings<br>about safety weather base activities the<br>second day the Press was shuttled off to<br>Antarctic field training away from the<br>base so I was left to spend the<br>afternoon with sir Ed it was a magical<br>day listening to Sir Ed recall the<br>things he had done when building Scout<br>base the crazy days of flying a small<br>aircraft that had been strapped on the<br>ship and reassembled down in the<br>Antarctic after a few test flights<br>they'd flew the aircraft over the dry<br>valleys and onto the polar<br>Plateau at breakfast next morning I<br>asked his opinion on how to deal with<br>the Press I'll never forget what he said<br>to me he said treat them like people<br>until they prove<br>otherwise we can make things a lot more<br>complicated if we want but sometimes<br>easiest is<br>best after my short dis after our short<br>discussion I just I decided to take sir<br>Ed's advice and work with the press and<br>guess what it all worked out perfectly<br>and we had an excellent time that week s<br>ed showed me what leadership was really<br>all about that morning so now let me<br>tell you my little secret to<br>life don't be afraid of failure don't be<br>afraid of losing control and enjoy all<br>the world can offer I learned at JPL<br>when you aim for the sky that failure is<br>normal expected and even<br>rewarded I learned from SED that<br>leadership is about letting others show<br>you their value by allowing them the<br>freedom to express themselves and I<br>learned from all my life experiences<br>that we only get this opportunity to<br>live in this world once so why not enjoy<br>it why not really do what inspires you<br>so today you are all here graduating and<br>about to embark on the world with your<br>new e ticket your new certificate of<br>value your new degree congratulations<br>thank<br>you well
