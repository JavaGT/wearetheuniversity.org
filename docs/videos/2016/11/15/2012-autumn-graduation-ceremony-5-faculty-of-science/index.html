honing<br>your skills and<br>capabilities so do keep in mind our ever<br>opportunities the critically important<br>role of major research Le universities<br>in Modern Life is not always<br>understood our Cutting Edge research is<br>vital for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and Social Development never more<br>so than in these globally uncertain<br>Economic<br>Times universi such as ours equipped<br>graduates like you not simply for the<br>imagined the University of Oakland's<br>aspirations for the period ahead and our<br>responses to an increasingly constrained<br>funding environment are comprehensive<br>and<br>demanding they are taking taking shape<br>in our draft strategic plan for 2013 to<br>2020 I encourage you to peruse this wide<br>ranging document on our website and let<br>feedback I urge you as eminent alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading University always<br>to remember your Elma<br>M we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral and<br>political as well as<br>Financial this at a time when our<br>country's universities received the<br>lowest income per student in the<br>developed<br>World your advocacy and influence are<br>vital in encouraging government and the<br>community at large to fund universities<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive economy and to create full<br>and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders but that's enough for me on<br>the challenges is currently facing<br>universities in New<br>Zealand for today is unquestionably your<br>day I warmly congratulate each and every<br>one of you and trust that you will long<br>cheer us memories of your graduation in<br>May<br>2012 I'm now very pleased to introduce<br>our speaker this afternoon Professor s<br>Peter<br>Gluckman he is a former dean of our<br>faculty of medical and Health Sciences<br>was the founding director of The liins<br>Institute and is one of New Zealand's<br>best known<br>scientists sir Peter's research has won<br>him numerous Awards and international<br>recognition including Fellowship of the<br>Commonwealth's most prestigious<br>scientific<br>organization the Royal Society<br>London he is the only New Zealander<br>elected to the Institute of Medicine of<br>the nationaly of Science in the USA and<br>and the Academy of Medical Sciences of<br>Great<br>Britain in 2001 he received New<br>Zealand's top science award the<br>Rutherford<br>medal he was made a knight of the New<br>Zealand order of Merit for services to<br>Medicine three years ago he was<br>appointed as the first Chief science<br>advisor to the prime minister of New<br>Zealand Su Peter is an international<br>advocate for science promoting the<br>translation of discoveries and<br>biomedical research into improvements in<br>long-term Health<br>outcomes he is the author of over 500<br>scientific papers and reviews and editor<br>Peter Chancellor Vice Chancellor members<br>of the<br>University graduent and<br>family firstly congratulations to all of<br>today's graduat and diplomates you<br>should be deservedly proud of having<br>graduated from New Zealand's highest<br>rank<br>University and from a faculty that is<br>distinguished internationally for its<br>outstanding scholarship research and<br>teaching<br>congratulations sometimes I'm asked<br>whether science graduates have a future<br>in New<br>Zealand I would turn that around and ask<br>does New Zealand have a future without<br>science graduates such as yourselves<br>certainly it would not there's no<br>challenge that we face as a nation over<br>coming decades that does not depend on<br>science in reaching a solution you'll be<br>critical to our economic our<br>environmental our soci social and our<br>cultural<br>development and this does not just mean<br>science in the laboratory or science in<br>the form<br>sense science has a critical role to<br>play in the public dialogue as we<br>develop a national consensus on how best<br>to manage our economic growth to meet<br>the societal aspirations of all while at<br>the same time protecting our fragile<br>environment to reach that<br>consensus we must we require a much more<br>scientifically aware and literate<br>population with whether you develop your<br>careers in science itself or use it as a<br>uh a stepping stone to another area of<br>activity your contribution to our<br>society based on your experiences and<br>this faculty in this University will be<br>critical so having graduated in science<br>is perhaps worth reflecting on what is<br>science science is not just a collection<br>of facts<br>rather it is a particular way of<br>understanding and observing the natural<br>and built world so as to gain a better<br>understanding of what it is it's wrong<br>to assume science is about certainty for<br>most of science certainty is not<br>possible it's largely about reducing<br>uncertainty as the great Noble laurate<br>and immunologist the late s Peter meare<br>once put it<br>science is a means by which we analyze<br>the many things that might be true about<br>the universe and peer them down to the<br>few that are probably<br>true I emphasize this because of the<br>great issues we<br>face for example how is the planet going<br>to deal with 40% more people all<br>expecting and deserving a higher<br>standard of living this can only mean<br>more use of the planet's finite<br>resources<br>yet at the same time there's also an<br>increasing need to understand how to<br>protect and conserve the fragile<br>Planet there are also important issues<br>that emerge as the very substrate of<br>society moves from the physical to the<br>virtual the internet has created the<br>problem of how to discern reliable from<br>less reliable information and lead to a<br>world smothered in information and pmic<br>leading to increasing confusion and<br>indeed potentially loss of confidence in<br>science as the key source of<br>knowledge but science both formal and<br>informal Remains the only process we<br>have to gather information and<br>understanding about our world on any<br>scale and from any perspective to reject<br>this is to reject the very basis of<br>logical assessment of the challenges we<br>Face the onedimensional science that<br>needs to be protected at all costs is<br>the need for the collection and<br>interpretation of data to be value free<br>such freedom from bias as I'm sure you<br>have learned already is not<br>easy but science alone does not<br>determine<br>Society we thankfully do not live in a<br>platonic Society rather we live in a<br>participatory democracy that is inde<br>underpinned by values that determine our<br>priorities and<br>tradeoffs but equally when values<br>dominate in the absence of science<br>decisions can be made on belief and<br>dogma and that can do us harm too it's<br>finding the right interplay between<br>knowledge and values that creates that<br>makes Society what it<br>is Technologies are developing f all the<br>time and they're having far greater<br>impact as they project so much more<br>quickly the challenge for society is to<br>understand and accommodate these<br>Technologies at a pace commensurate with<br>their development otherwise some<br>important Technologies may be wrongly<br>rejected and yet others may be misused<br>misused or their harm<br>misunderstood indeed this conflict<br>between the PTI of development and<br>understanding by Society can manifest in<br>unfortunate ways for example in anti-<br>scientism and a logical but<br>understandable response to the pace of<br>change inevitably therefore well-trained<br>science graduates such as yourselves are<br>critical to a modern participatory<br>democracy we want you to participate<br>indeed you must we need you not not to<br>just use your hard-earned degree to<br>follow your aspirations but also to use<br>your knowledge of the scientific process<br>and the understandings of science to<br>participate in helping Society navigate<br>the challenges<br>ahead universities are special places<br>their roles of critics and consciences<br>of society is enshrined in law and<br>tradition often this has been assumed to<br>be the role of your colleagues and other<br>faculties such as arts and law but that<br>obligation is equally so of you as<br>science graduates as graduates of this<br>University you're are now members of<br>this University's Court of convocation<br>you remain as members of this<br>University in this new role it is<br>important that you play your role in<br>protecting the contribution of<br>scholarship on one hand to this nation's<br>development and participate on the other<br>hand in the critical and public dialogue<br>between knowledge and values that will<br>be so essential as this Society moves<br>forward once again congratulations to<br>you<br>all on your behalf can I thank sir Peter<br>for his wise and interesting obser<br>obervations as our chief<br>scientist this is a meeting of council<br>and convocation of the university

further offending in<br>men who had received treatment related<br>to sexual offending against children<br>with a view to improving Rehabilitation<br>efforts Annabelle Elizabeth Clark<br>University doctoral scholar Annabelle<br>developed and tri a new education-based<br>intervention to reduce fatigue after<br>stroke with a view to to determining if<br>participants would accept the<br>intervention and if it was likely to be<br>of clinical<br>benefit Alexandra Louise Hayes<br>University doctoral scholar Alex<br>investigated the effectiveness of brief<br>mindfulness training for socially<br>anxious adults her findings support the<br>use of mindfulness training in<br>psychological treatments for social<br>anxiety apula Julia Yuan Julia<br>investigated the social demographic<br>educational characteristics and<br>defending behavior of Pacific Island<br>youths who offend violently and compared<br>them with those of Mari and palangi<br>violent youth offenders This research is<br>likely to provide us with a greater<br>understanding of this challenging<br>demographic and inform the way that we<br>work with Pacific island Youth and their<br>families<br>altina kulakova University doctoral<br>scholar Tina investigated recognition<br>memory and electrophysiological<br>processes linked with memory formation<br>and healthy Elder adults with a view to<br>developing a protocol capable of<br>identifying the earlier stages of<br>Alzheimer's disease<br>Penny Jane Mansel University doctoral<br>scholar Penny investigated young adult<br>stepchildren's experiences of<br>relationships with stepmothers she aimed<br>to gain the perspective of stepchildren<br>on those experiences that contributed to<br>a positive stepmother stepchild<br>relationship and those experiences that<br>were difficult and hindered the<br>development of the relationship she also<br>examined the relationship in terms of<br>its development over<br>time Sarah Jane mcneel University<br>doctoral<br>scholar Sarah examined the central role<br>attachment and security plays and<br>exacerbating reactions to stressful life<br>events such as symptoms of depression<br>her research has important implications<br>for understanding and counteracting<br>people's vulnerabilities to depression<br>when facing daily stress and more<br>substantial life<br>difficulties Casey Alexandra mindola<br>Casey examined the impact on Marty Faro<br>of their children's deliberate self harm<br>their beliefs about the reasons for such<br>acts and their treatment needs with a<br>view to enhancing treatment provision<br>for such families within Mental Health<br>Services<br>Shephard Matt investigated the design of<br>a computerized cognitive behavioral<br>therapy program Sparks and evaluated its<br>Effectiveness for Marty adolescence by<br>conducting focus groups in a small pilot<br>study he also analyzed the Marty<br>participant data from a large randomized<br>control trial the finding is indicate<br>that ccbt can be equally effective as<br>the treatment Marty young people<br>currently receive for treatment of mild<br>depression Julia Maria Somerville<br>University doctoral scholar Julia<br>focused on how Nationwide youth<br>development program how a nationwide<br>youth development program selects<br>participants and in particular how<br>decisions are made to exclude potential<br>participants with specified risk<br>behaviors she also looked at<br>opportunities for supporting young<br>excluded to the degree of doctor of<br>philosophy Suzanne Jennifer echy in<br>sport and exercise science Suzanne<br>explored novel methods for promoting<br>brain plas I it and motor learning after<br>stroke her findings were recognized by<br>the American Heart and Stroke<br>Association as one of the top 25<br>advances in brain recovery recovery and<br>2010 heti a Monga in operations research<br>had he studied the effects of simple<br>model<br>balancing of the costs of private versus<br>public<br>transportation numerical results show<br>that giving individuals information<br>about the current state of the system<br>May sometimes lead to considerable<br>improvements in performance and reduce<br>delays<br>Rachel Vanita bovich in computer science<br>university doctoral scholar bright<br>future top achiever doctoral scholar<br>Rachel investigated the use of data<br>mining techniques for construction of<br>digital Inc recognizers she developed<br>new recognizers which could accurately<br>discriminate between drawing and writing<br>Inc Rachel<br>Lenley valme Bradham in sport and<br>exercise science Lenley showed that<br>non-invasive brain stimulation<br>techniques of the nonstroke hemisphere<br>could be used to improve control of the<br>affected arm in patients with mild<br>impairment after stroke based on her<br>novel model of Upper Limb control after<br>stroke she hypothesized and demonstrated<br>that the same technique may degrade<br>control of the partic arm in patients<br>with more severe impairment reminding us<br>that brain stimulation is not a one-size<br>fits-all<br>approach Jonathan Francis Briggs in<br>statistics University doctoral scholar<br>Jonathan developed statistical methods<br>for estimating the uncertainty in<br>predictions from large spatial models<br>mods like weather forecasting and<br>climate<br>models Emma Louise Carol and biological<br>sciences Emma used genetic monitoring to<br>investigate the recovery and population<br>structure of the New Zealand Southern<br>right whale this work showed that the<br>New Zealand population is distinct to<br>the the Australian populations and that<br>whales from The Remnant carving grounds<br>near the Oakland islands are slowly<br>recolonizing former carving grounds<br>Zealand Jason Kevin gie in sport and<br>exercise science Jason investigated the<br>effect of a low impact balance and lower<br>limb strength training intervention on<br>the sensory and motor complications of<br>peripheral nerve damage in patients with<br>diabetes he found that increased sensory<br>function was possible with low impact<br>training without the increased risk of<br>PL plantar ulceration due to the<br>repetitive tissue loading found in<br>training Emily paig Harvey in<br>mathematics University doctoral scholar<br>bright future top achiever doctoral<br>scholar Emily investigated the<br>mechanisms underlying oscillations of<br>calcium in mathematical models of<br>various cell types these
