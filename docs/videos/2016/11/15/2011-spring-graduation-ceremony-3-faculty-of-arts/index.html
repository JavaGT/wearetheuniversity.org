Spring graduation for a<br>third<br>year the regularity of graduation<br>ceremonies makes them no less special<br>for the University and me personally<br>than for those of you being capped here<br>today many for the first<br>time it is also a pleasure to return to<br>the ockland town hall along our<br>traditional graduation venue for the<br>first time since<br>2009 the aot center which we now use has<br>been temporarily captured for Rugby<br>purposes graduation is a festive event<br>rich in history PP and color with a liy<br>array of contemporary touches here in<br>ockland there Rich mix of cultures and<br>ethnicities can be seen in the Striking<br>variety of dress and adornments worn by<br>graduan today is one of hard earned<br>Celebration by you the graduat

each and<br>every one one of<br>you the University of Oakland is<br>deservedly ranked as one of the best<br>universities in the<br>world your qualifications will always<br>serve you well in this country and<br>abroad whether in qualifying you for a<br>satisfying career or in leading to more<br>advanced study or simply as a rout to<br>personal and intellectual<br>enrichment in today's everchanging<br>Workforce you cannot afford to stop<br>learning so please keep in mind there<br>are enormous range of postgraduate<br>opportunities I urge you as alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading<br>University always to remember your Elma<br>M we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral political as<br>well as<br>Financial your advocacy and influence<br>are vital in encouraging government and<br>the community at large to fund<br>University<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive<br>economy and to create a full and<br>satisfying life for all new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>projects scholarships and professorial<br>cheers The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities is not well<br>understood and and therefore<br>insufficiently<br>acknowledged it is inconceivable that a<br>developed Progressive 21st century<br>Nation can maintain that status without<br>strong internationally recognized<br>research-based<br>universities such as the University of<br>Oakland our Innovative research is vital<br>for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social cohesion never more so<br>than in the testing Economic Times we<br>now face in the wake of the global re<br>ession and the devastating Christ Church<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private philanthropy not<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing this<br>institution for today is unquestionably<br>your day I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long cherish memories of<br>2011 our speaker at this ceremony is<br>Professor Annie Goldson from our<br>department of film television and media<br>studies she has been producing and<br>directing award-winning documentaries<br>dockor dramas and experimental film and<br>video for 20 years<br>her films have won more than 50 awards<br>at International Film festivals and are<br>Innovative Professor Goldson is best<br>known for her acclaimed documentaries<br>which include punitive damage an iseland<br>calling and more recently brother number<br>one about a New Zealander who perished<br>in the genocide in<br>Cambodia she has been president of the<br>screen director Guild of New Zealand and<br>she received an order of New Zealand<br>2018 Professor Goldstone gave her PhD at<br>ockland after graduating BSC from otaga<br>University and Ma from New York<br>University she has published widely and<br>journals and books and earlier this year<br>she was promoted to professor and only<br>last week she delivered her an aural<br>professorial lecture Professor<br>Goldson Chancellor Vice Chancellor<br>members of council members of the<br>University gradu far families and<br>friends curato it's fantastic to see you<br>all I'm sure there are some familiar<br>faces out there although you look a bit<br>of a sea to me at the moment<br>um I know many of you will have traveled<br>here not just from Oakland and around<br>aroa but from many other countries too<br>to celebrate the achievements of your<br>sons and daughters so congratulations to<br>you for raising such wonderful children<br>and congratulations of course to the<br>students who studied so hard I've been<br>teaching at this University for 20 years<br>now which seems quite scary to me it<br>only seems like yesterday that I began<br>when I began teaching in fact I wasn't a<br>whole lot older than my students but now<br>I could definitely be their mother which<br>is something I think<br>about over this time I've watched our<br>students graduate and Achieve great<br>things taking up influential positions<br>in New Zealand and in their home<br>countries from making award-winning<br>short films and documentaries to<br>assuming positions in cultural<br>institutions or to becoming academics<br>themselves it's wonderful to see that<br>they've benefited from an Arts education<br>and I now I speak from our department<br>and the faculty in congratulating you<br>with very proud<br>indeed I've watched the student body<br>change quite rapidly in the last two<br>decades the university is a much more<br>culturally diverse place today and it<br>has made the classroom much more lively<br>with some genuinely interesting<br>exchanges I have found that these<br>changes have made my teaching more<br>enriching as kiwi students and I learn<br>more about the world through our<br>International students experiences and I<br>know the letter learned from us about<br>life here in New<br>Zealand it's almost a cliche that we<br>live now in a world increasingly<br>mediated defined it appears not just<br>through media such as film and<br>television but through the internet<br>Google Twitter Facebook Etc it is a very<br>recent history and the fact that these<br>Technologies are so present today always<br>surprises me that they were only<br>invented if you like such a short period<br>ago digital Technologies are reshaping<br>our disciplines from classics to gaming<br>Shifting the way we teach learn and and<br>how we understand the world and each<br>other nonetheless although we in media<br>St studies stay a breast of these<br>developments which of course are bread<br>and butter to us I think the ability to<br>think to think critically to research<br>and write to express our thinking to<br>analyze remain crucial skills perhaps<br>even more important in this day of of of<br>new technologies so these are the<br>research and critical thinking skills<br>that I believe a Bachelor of Arts at<br>this University you're an advanced<br>degree too can really assist you in your<br>future<br>life we know it's not all good fun being<br>a student there's always the pressure of<br>deadlines the time and effort that needs<br>to be put into study and I applaud you<br>all for having having aspirations and<br>for following them I know it's all too<br>easy to slump down in front of<br>television and watch the All Blacks<br>particularly at the moment and that<br>keeping up one study takes disciplin and<br>commitment but it is those kinds of<br>commitments learned at universities that<br>can assist you in developing a life<br>that's more meaningful engaging with the<br>workplace with Society with culture and<br>the Arts that will give you a richer<br>life but will also allow you to<br>contribute to the<br>world and of course there are the fun<br>times of being a student and now you<br>should really let your hair down<br>exchanging ideas getting involved in<br>campus and Oakland life in this lovely<br>city that we live in so congratulations<br>once more and now it's time for you to<br>celebrate and party Cura<br>thank you
