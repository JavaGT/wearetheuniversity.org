you<br>well in this country and abroad whether<br>in qualifying you for a satisfying<br>career or in leading to more advanced<br>study or simply as a route to personal<br>and intellectual<br>enrichment in today's everchanging<br>Workforce you cannot afford to stop<br>learning so please keep in mind our<br>opportunities I urge you as alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading University always<br>to remember your Elma<br>Mar we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral and<br>political as well as<br>Financial your advocacy and influence<br>are vital in encouraging government and<br>the community at large to fund<br>universities so they can generate the<br>knowledge needed to drive a productive<br>and competitive economy and to create<br>full and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become critically important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>projects scholarships and professorial<br>cheers The crucial contribution of major<br>research universities is not well<br>understood and therefore insufficiently<br>acknowledged it is inconceivable that a<br>developed Progressive 21st century<br>Nation can maintain that status without<br>strong internationally recognized<br>research-based<br>universities such as the University of<br>ockland our Innovative research is vital<br>for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and social<br>cohesion never more so than in the<br>testing Economic Times we face in the<br>wake of the global recession<br>and now the devastating Christ Church<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private<br>philanthropy not<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing this institution<br>for today is unquestionably your day

experienced members of it<br>who have extended your<br>qualifications whatever stage you are at<br>and whatever sector you are involved in<br>this is an incredibly exciting time to<br>be involved in<br>education those of you who are involved<br>in social work will also value the<br>importance of Education in improving the<br>situation of people in our<br>society our world is changing rapidly<br>because of technology and<br>globalization and education plays an<br>Ever greater role in preparing students<br>of all ages for success in it I've<br>recently returned from a principal's<br>delegation to China and I was amazed at<br>the rate of change which can be seen<br>there and the very high value placed on<br>education you know that the knowledge<br>you have gained in your studies is just<br>the beginning you will go on learning<br>and reflecting on how you will use that<br>new<br>knowledge like you students in our<br>schools will have to continue to learn<br>as they adapt to new situations in every<br>aspect of their<br>lives we're very fortunate in New<br>Zealand that we have a new National<br>curriculum which places value on<br>knowledge but also on the competencies<br>such as thinking and<br>self-management which students need to<br>continue their<br>learning our curriculum also places<br>emphasis on<br>globalization and Entrepreneurship<br>which I saw explicit examples of in<br>China One organization which we visited<br>had a staff of 90 and 20 of those young<br>people had been educated at either<br>secondary or tertiary level in New<br>Zealand or<br>Australia a very clear example to me of<br>the value added for them in studying in<br>an English-speaking country and an<br>example two of the strength of the<br>asia-pacific<br>connection today we know much more about<br>how people learn and what factors are<br>most important in maximizing<br>achievement the best evident synthesis<br>commissioned by the Ministry of<br>Education and researched by Professor<br>Vivian Robinson Professor Helen timly<br>associate professor Graham AC<br>and other faculty members you will have<br>been taught by here at the University of<br>Oakland have identified the factors<br>which most benefit the learning of<br>students of teachers and the work of<br>school<br>leaders the metaanalysis of professor<br>John hatti build a story of the power of<br>teachers and the value of their feedback<br>to students<br>your job as teachers is to be aware of<br>the research and to use it to inform<br>your practice in the<br>classroom what you do should be<br>deliberate and reflective and aim to<br>support all of your students to make<br>them The Confident connected actively<br>involved lifelong Learners identified in<br>our our<br>curriculum your focus has to be student<br>achievement and I believe that the most<br>important element that underpins your<br>success with this is the relationship<br>you establish with each of your<br>students they want to know that you care<br>about them and care about their learning<br>then they will trust you and they will<br>take the risks to make mistakes Stakes<br>which they need to do in order to<br>progress further in their<br>learning in research we've done at my<br>school with our students the most<br>important factor that they identified in<br>helping them achieve was that the<br>learning our education system is world<br>class we are fourth in the world in<br>achieving achievement levels for English<br>mathematics and science for students<br>under 15 is measured by the<br>oecd export education is the fifth<br>highest income earner for the country<br>producing $2.3<br>billion our researchers are respected<br>worldwide we have much to be proud of<br>but we still have challenges to<br>face one of the most important tasks<br>that you will have<br>ahead whether you are in education or in<br>social work is to engage students and to<br>convince all of them and their families<br>that education is crucially important<br>for their<br>Futures students in many other countries<br>such as the Chinese these students that<br>I saw are very aware of that and our<br>students will be competing with them for<br>jobs in the future whether those jobs<br>are here in New Zealand or in other<br>countries in our Global<br>Village I wish you every success in your<br>careers ahead in what for me has been a<br>very challenging and very satisfying<br>profession<br>thank you Mrs gun for a very interesting<br>speech and some wise and uh<br>relevant comments
