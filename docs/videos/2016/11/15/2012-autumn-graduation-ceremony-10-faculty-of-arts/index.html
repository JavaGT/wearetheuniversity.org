of council members of the<br>University graduat families and<br>friends today we are celebrating your<br>journey to this point you are graduating<br>a very special transitional time time<br>when you look back on your<br>accomplishments and forward to an<br>imagined<br>future as each of you contemplates your<br>next steps some will have very clear<br>ideas about what next others may be a<br>little<br>unsure it's a good question to think<br>about how best we put careers together<br>in<br>2012 in the first 10 years after I<br>finished my undergraduate degree made<br>majoring in political science most of<br>the steps I took didn't add up in an<br>orderly way on a<br>CV I variously worked in a sheep sharing<br>gang in The Wire rapper still one of the<br>highlights of my life in a romantic<br>Cowboy kind of way and I can actually<br>tell my pendel from my Romney on<br>archaological dig Excavating the remains<br>of a Roman fort on the M5 out of London<br>I traveled in America and Europe lived<br>in London designed costume jewelry for<br>my fashion designer friends worked on<br>Organic Farms worked as an assistant to<br>Peter mcy the Wellington Art Gallery<br>dealer and tramped and climbed in and<br>around New<br>Zealand the one thing I didn't focus on<br>was a<br>career yes I did do three years working<br>for uni lever and Anglo Dutch Global<br>corporate giant based in London but that<br>was the background context to having a<br>very good<br>time I was quite slow to make the<br>connection that if I wanted freedom and<br>I wasn't on track to be a traditional<br>wife I had to be financially independent<br>and i' better get a little bit more<br>serious so I hopped skipped and jumped<br>into the world of advertising as a<br>researcher with an interest in consumer<br>research in 1984 I was made the research<br>director of maai King soon to become<br>such and such<br>the agency was to have a golden run in<br>the 80s and I ended up the decade<br>working for them in New York I was lucky<br>because in part timing is everything in<br>the late 80s I married in the early 9s<br>we had twins now doing con degrees at<br>theago<br>University as a contrast the last 10<br>years of my life have been quite<br>different again my husband won a<br>fellowship to study at Harvard in 2001<br>so as a family we moved to Boston I did<br>the logical thing a woman and Leadership<br>program at the Harvard Business School<br>but I also did a number of papers on the<br>visual arts for the sheer love of the<br>topics this timeout helped me and<br>reinvent and set some new<br>goals I was no longer content to see my<br>future contained within discovering<br>people's serial<br>preferences in 2005 I graduated from<br>this University with a doctor in history<br>and then wrote a book on the visual<br>history of World War I I subsequently<br>curated two exhibitions started a<br>Consulting business and traveled to the<br>new aises of power in the global economy<br>China and<br>India at the same time I have become<br>passionately interested in poverty and<br>social justice<br>issues I support a child Rehabilitation<br>project in India that aims to stop child<br>trafficking a program program for<br>pregnant mothers in Bangladesh and have<br>spent time in<br>Ethiopia deep deepening my understanding<br>of the programs that improve the lives<br>of women and I should add that one of<br>the platforms of our Consulting business<br>the Providence report is how do we help<br>more New Zealand businesses to become<br>more asianf facing how do we begin to<br>have deeper conversations with our Asian<br>neighbors one of the questions I'm often<br>asked today is why do I do the things I<br>do what inspires me it's a combination<br>of things an unease about the present<br>about the status<br>quo and a curiosity about what is<br>actually<br>possible I truly believe one can take<br>steps that are somewhat unorthodox that<br>actually add up to something very new<br>and<br>exciting many of the exciting things<br>that are happening in our globalized<br>world are about crossing boundaries<br>entering into deep conversations with<br>people very different from yourself<br>approaching things from a multi-<br>disciplinary<br>approach I also try and live by some<br>guiding<br>principles because ultimately it isn't<br>about what we do with our lives but how<br>we choose to live in the<br>world first if you ask me we should stop<br>thinking about careers and start<br>thinking about being Transformers bridg<br>Builders plant waterers and translators<br>in our complex world it's about having a<br>bigger idea about how we Define who we<br>are secondly I want to emphasize the<br>importance of<br>generosity what inspires people to be<br>generous I look back and appreciate how<br>many wise people have given me guidance<br>listened to me at crunch times and<br>inspired me to take new<br>steps I think about all those people who<br>have come before me that have made my<br>access to education possible and that<br>have inspired and nurtured me along the<br>way while we pay for our education a<br>great education is so much more it's<br>about being taught to think in new ways<br>to see the world in new<br>ways it's important too to stay engaged<br>and Enchanted by the world around you<br>even if it's moving even faster and ever<br>more friend<br>gentically life is full of unexpected<br>pleasures and<br>enticements and the real school has been<br>able to see the potential in any<br>opportunity that arises rather than<br>being fixed to a particular professional<br>Identity or feeling no identity at<br>all as we actively engage as authentic<br>individuals we become that bit more<br>human but first things first today we<br>thank you Dr kister for those very I<br>think<br>fascinating reminiscences and some of<br>your experiences and the advice that<br>came with<br>it uh as you said the most important<br>thing that can come out of an education<br>is that you learn to think<br>um and uh you reminded us of that very<br>important tourism can I ask you all uh<br>kister this is a meeting of council
