will<br>be conferred and diplomas awarded in the<br>faculty of<br>engineering a total of 444 in person<br>Absentia as Chancellor I am privileged<br>to preside at graduation once<br>more the twice yearly cycle of<br>graduation ceremonies makes them no less<br>significant for the University and me<br>personally than for those of you being<br>kept here today many for the first and<br>only<br>time graduation is always a festive<br>event rich in history Pomp and color but<br>with some endearing contemporary<br>touches here in Oakland our enviable mix<br>of cultures and ethnicities is evident<br>in the variety of dress and adornments<br>graduand today is one of<br>Celebration hard earned and well<br>deserved by you the gradu and diplomates<br>on your academic Feats and by your<br>family and friends who have encouraged<br>and supported you in good times and in<br>success the university represented by<br>the council and academic staff members<br>seated behind me and those many<br>professional staff who direct<br>proceedings with une hearing Precision<br>takes equal satisfaction in your hugely<br>significant<br>day the University of ockland is<br>deservedly ranked as one of the best<br>universities in the<br>world the qualifications bestowed on you<br>today will always serve you well in this<br>country and abroad whether in qualifying<br>you for a fulfilling career or in<br>leading to further challenging study or<br>simply for your own personal and<br>intellectual enrichment<br>ment in today's world of constant and<br>often bewildering change you can never<br>afford to stop learning and honing your<br>skills and<br>capabilities so keep so do keep in mind<br>opportunities the critically important<br>role of major research Le universities<br>such as the University of Oakland in<br>Modern Life is not always understood<br>good our cutting ede research is vital<br>for long-term sustainable economic<br>growth and Social<br>Development never more so than in these<br>uncertain Economic<br>Times universities such as ours equip<br>graduates like you not simply for the<br>jobs of today but for careers not yet<br>imagined the University of auckland's<br>aspirations for the period ahead and our<br>responses to an increasingly constrained<br>funding environment are comprehensive<br>and<br>demanding they are taking shape in our<br>draft strategic plan for 2013 to<br>2020 I encourage you to peruse this wide<br>ranging document on our website and let<br>feedback I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University always to<br>remember your Elma<br>mat we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral and<br>political as well as<br>Financial this at a time when our<br>country's universities received the<br>lowest income per student in the<br>developed<br>World your advocacy and influence are<br>vital in encouraging government and the<br>community at large to fund universities<br>so they can generate the knowledge<br>needed to drive a productive and<br>competitive economy and to create full<br>and satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders<br>that's enough for me on the challenges<br>currently facing<br>universities for today is unquestionably<br>your day I warmly congratulate each and<br>every one of you and trust that you will<br>long cherish memories of your graduation<br>2012 our speaker at this first<br>graduation ceremony is Dr Mark Sager who<br>is director of the laboratory for<br>animate Technologies here at the<br>University this new<br>laboratory based at our ockland<br>bioengineering Institute is set to take<br>computer take computer animation to a<br>new<br>level it will do no less than simulate<br>the lifelike qualities and the<br>observable reflexes and behavior of one<br>person engaging with<br>another<br>Dr SAR previously worked for WETA<br>digital where he created technology to<br>make digital digital characters such as<br>avatars na'vi people appear realistic<br>and<br>animate he has a Bachelor of Science and<br>a<br>PhD in engineering from the University<br>of Oakland and he began his career<br>building Comm computer simulations of<br>the human eye for virtual<br>surgery Dr Sear's ering work and<br>computer generated faces has been<br>recognized with consecutive o Oscars at<br>the 2010 and 2011 scitech Awards a<br>branch of the Academy Awards that<br>recognizes movie science and<br>technological<br>achievements in March this year this<br>University bestowed on him a<br>Sega<br>Chancellor Vice Chancellor Pro<br>Chancellor members of council members of<br>the University graduates families and<br>friends we are here today to celebrate<br>the hard-earned achievements of the new<br>graduates and to acknowledge all of the<br>effort put in by those who taught and<br>supported them being here takes me back<br>to my own graduation last century and it<br>is wonderful to note that the<br>friendships formed with many of my<br>co-students and mentors have with stood<br>the test of<br>time digging around in the garage I<br>discovered some cultural artifacts from<br>that period which have also withstood<br>the test of time which reflect the<br>disciplined and intellectual environment<br>pedigree<br>and this next one in<br>particular is a little bit more<br>interesting<br>so now this artifact is dated from about<br>1995 and here's what looks to be the<br>advanced design of a flying<br>machine curiously shaped like a pig with<br>the words us not crawl indicating not<br>only advanced technology but also the<br>development of an advanced engineering<br>language now aside from its undoubtable<br>cultural heritage Engineering also<br>stands out from the other disciplines<br>because it enables you to both design<br>and do you can make your own reality you<br>never know where it will take you I<br>could not have possibly guessed that I<br>would have ended up spending a large<br>part of my career in Hollywood<br>opportunities are always presenting<br>themselves you just have to notice them<br>every step of the way you can steer<br>things towards your goals if you want to<br>design a turbo encabulator with Advanced<br>righton memory then you<br>can maybe one day we'll we will be able<br>to emulate living systems that's what<br>I'm starting a new lab to look at doing<br>and I imagine that there's some good<br>graduates in the audience that um could<br>be interested<br>now speaking about um emulating living<br>systems three engineering students were<br>gathered together discussing the<br>possible designers of the human body one<br>said it was a mechanical engineer just<br>look at the Joint another said no it was<br>an it was an electrical engineer the<br>nervous system has many thousands of<br>electrical connections the last said<br>well actually it was a civil engineer<br>who else would run a toxic waste<br>do what you are interested in set<br>yourself almost impossible goals and<br>importantly enjoy the process of trying<br>to achieve them and enjoy the people in<br>the places that it takes you you will<br>find your limitations but these are the<br>these are the boundary constraints of<br>Life depending on your personality you<br>may work within these boundaries or you<br>may want to cross the products of your<br>interests and explore new<br>directions but today youve reached a<br>milestone you have been subjected to<br>tensile testing and have pass quality<br>control if the recent strain of doing<br>the exams has made you a bit<br>tensor you can now apply relaxation<br>methods to reduce your<br>stress after years of being dependent<br>you have now reached full rank with<br>maximum Independence you are ready to<br>transform your coordinate systems<br>contribute to your own countries and<br>project your ideas into the world if you<br>multiply you may have to undergo a<br>householder transformation and then<br>decompose but either way try to stay<br>positive definite in everything that you<br>do and remember life is a big Global<br>optimization problem your career is not<br>the most important part of it if the<br>functioning of your career and family<br>interaction is not in equilibrium you<br>may need to change your<br>equations extend your bandwidth<br>adaptively filter your negative feedback<br>and keep your system in<br>control and lastly do everything in<br>you I think I might have said in my<br>opening remarks that<br>universities uh train people and educate<br>people for jobs not not even dreamed of<br>and our guest speaker as a classic<br>example of that particular comment thank<br>you Dr SAR for a very interesting and<br>insightful<br>speech this is a meeting of council and<br>convocation of the university for a<br>ceremony of conferring degrees and<br>awarding<br>diplomas at this ceremony the vice<br>Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutchen<br>and I will be conferring degrees and<br>awarding diplomas I now invite the vice<br>Chancellor to award the diplomas and<br>confer the degrees in the first half of<br>this<br>ceremony by the authority vested in Me<br>by
