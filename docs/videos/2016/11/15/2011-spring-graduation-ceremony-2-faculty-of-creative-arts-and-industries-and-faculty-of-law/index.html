whether in qualifying you for a<br>satisfying<br>career or leading to more advanced<br>study or simply as a root to personal<br>and intellect ual<br>enrichment in today's everchanging world<br>you cannot afford to stop<br>learning so please keep in mind our<br>enormous range of postgraduate<br>opportunities I urge you as alumni of<br>New Zealand's leading University always<br>to remember your Elma<br>Mar we depend increasingly on our<br>graduates for support moral and<br>political as well as<br>Financial your advocacy and influence<br>are vital in encouraging government and<br>the community at large to fund<br>universities so they can generate the<br>knowledge needed to drive a productive<br>and competitive<br>economy and to create full and<br>satisfying lives for all new<br>zealanders at the same time philanthropy<br>has become crucially important to our<br>University funding major capital<br>cheers the CR iCal contribution of major<br>research universities is not well<br>understood and therefore insufficiently<br>acknowledged it is inconceivable that a<br>de developed Progressive 21st century<br>Nation can maintain that status without<br>strong internationally recognized<br>research-based universities such as the<br>University of<br>Oakland Innovative research is vital for<br>long-term sustainable economic growth<br>and social cohesion<br>never more so than in the testing<br>Economic Times we face in the wake of<br>global recession and now the devastating<br>Christ Church<br>earthquakes universities equip graduates<br>like you not simply for the jobs of<br>today but for future careers not yet<br>imagined universities need greater<br>investment by government the commercial<br>sector and private philanthropy not<br>less but that's sufficient for me on the<br>challenges facing<br>Institution for today is unquestionably<br>your day I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long cherish the memories<br>2011 our speaker this afternoon is Mr<br>Roy clear who took up his appointment as<br>director of ockland War memor War<br>Memorial Museum only last month he came<br>from Britain where he was chief<br>executive of the museums libraries and<br>archives Council from<br>2007 this organization's<br>responsibilities include the<br>accreditation of museums the the<br>designation of outstanding Collections<br>and administering schemes to develop the<br>strength and reputation of Collections<br>and encourage their accessibility to<br>people from 2000 to 2007 Mr clear was<br>director of the national Maritime Museum<br>in Greenwich where he expanded<br>resourcing for scholarship ships schools<br>and informal<br>learning he and his team initiated<br>highly successful exhibitions<br>fundraising C campaigns and<br>Redevelopment<br>projects Mr clear was awarded the CBE in<br>June 2017 for his services to<br>museums he was formerly a rear Admiral<br>in the Royal Navy which he joined at the<br>age of<br>15 a keen yachtsman he competed in the<br>first wre round the world race in<br>1974 Mr<br>clear uh Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor academic<br>staff parents fena friends gradu most<br>importantly tenot<br>tenot<br>tenot this is for me I didn't know about<br>for you a very happy day I can still<br>remember uh graduating in<br>physics I can still remember paying for<br>my children to<br>graduate and I can still remember<br>running the Naval College when I was<br>sort of the vice Chancellor without<br>enough<br>money and I'm moderately irresponsible<br>today but I do empathize with everybody<br>who's paid for something parents fena<br>friends I suspect that you lot uh<br>time we've had a very interesting six<br>weeks my wife and I we've been made very<br>welcome very welcome indeed here in New<br>Zealand and I bring greetings from<br>London to this ceremony and it is uh<br>therefore a 25,000 km speech that you're<br>getting uh from somebody who has taken<br>to New Zealand that's why I've come here<br>and rather as the Chancellor suggested I<br>didn't know that my career would bring<br>me here and I think having read physics<br>I didn't know that I ended up running a<br>bunch of museums either so I think just<br>hang in there because what you've read<br>may not be what you end up reading if<br>you see what I mean what I do know is<br>that this is rather an exciting week in<br>other ways uh it was this week in 1893<br>that New Zealand led the world on uh<br>votes for women uh some 25 years ahead<br>of the UK for example<br>uh earlier this week on Sunday up at the<br>senat half at the Museum uh we marked<br>the Battle of Britain and the 70th<br>anniversary of the air training Corp and<br>it only rained between 11:00 and<br>11:30 so you can imagine that as that's<br>roughly when you do remembrance we<br>remembered with some stoicism and<br>conviction the sacrifice of those who'd<br>gone before us and I can tell you that<br>personally I was sitting between an<br>umbrella on the left and one on the<br>right and you know what<br>happens I'm now wearing my old suit<br>forgive me what we know from that<br>commemoration what we know from<br>decisions such as New Zealand took in<br>1893 is that one of the things we would<br>all be is leaders we're all going to be<br>leading something and it seems to me<br>following the advice of Winston<br>Churchill to a new member of parliament<br>before they made speech uh my boy make<br>one point only no one will remember what<br>it is but they can pass you in the<br>corridor and say good point I'm going to<br>make one point only which is that we are<br>all leaders and one of the wonderful<br>things that New Zealand is tackling<br>right now uh in the treaty settlement<br>era is How to Be an Effective bicultural<br>Nation but in your Nations and many of<br>you come from other countries there will<br>be similar Grand strategic issues that<br>affect the quality of life for millions<br>of people and we're not innocent<br>bystanders in it I think it's also<br>interesting when you look at that idea<br>of leadership that just today Len Brown<br>has published the draft Oakland plan and<br>this is looking ahead 30 years it's<br>looking to 2040 where are we all going<br>to be in 2040 and what jobs will we be<br>doing but learn is not going to lead<br>this on his own he needs us because<br>every great city is three things it's a<br>great<br>economy uh it's undoubtedly a great<br>place to live as the liable City idea<br>suggests but it's also going to be a<br>city wherever it is of Social and<br>economic divides and one of our<br>challenges one of the challenges of<br>today's graduates is what are we going<br>to do to assist the process of Rec Rec<br>conciliation across that divide how do<br>we contribute to the economy how do we<br>contribute to the great place to live<br>well of course a museum and art<br>galleries and culture generally are all<br>about a great place to live and the<br>economy and the understanding across<br>Generations because moderately we're<br>neutral and we're able to be a place<br>where people can debate but actually<br>each one of us has as an opportunity the<br>leadership to make the difference and<br>this isn't new if you'll forgive uh a<br>mariner drawing on a mariner uh an<br>ancient mariner even more ancient than<br>me going back to uh a nelsonic period uh<br>Nelson who had quite a bit to do uh for<br>Britain in a period when Napoleon was a<br>bit of a risk one of the interesting<br>things about him was he studied the<br>French very closely he studied them in<br>all kinds of ways and he wrote copious<br>letters and a former colleague of mine<br>Dr Colin white no longer with us<br>published a thousand of Nelson's letters<br>to commemorate the bicentenary of the<br>battle of chaga in 2005 one of the<br>letters picks up on Nelson's critique of<br>a French General's<br>leadership and Nelson writes of the<br>French General that there are two kinds<br>of leadership he's perceived Alo we go<br>Al you<br>go and what is interesting about<br>Nelson's evaluation because Nelson was<br>always conscious of himself was he<br>writes of course I Nelson follow our law<br>but so does the French General in other<br>words there was also an underlying<br>admiration for the<br>foe ladies and gentlemen I think the<br>proposition we have in front of us is<br>that Al we go is a really good<br>Leadership Model for us to think about<br>as we now go out in celebration of a<br>great achievement of degrees hard fought<br>for I still remember being completely<br>overwhelmed by the whole pressure of<br>getting the degree and then the complete<br>Joy of being awarded it and then<br>wondering what happened next but the we<br>go is absolutely something we can all<br>hang in on and it's handed down 200<br>years we don't need to look for somebody<br>who's making money today writing a book<br>on management or leadership technique<br>although they can be useful there is a<br>historic reference to a sty of<br>leadership in which Nelson himself<br>worried about whether his people were<br>fed you might say well that was self-<br>serving he needed them to fight in fact<br>he worried about them to a a very<br>substantial degree that their health<br>should be protected he worried about<br>them in a life after they were fighting<br>with him and his letters nudge his<br>captains on the quality of their living<br>as we go to our workplaces as we think<br>about this and I've just inherited this<br>great museum with about 500 people of<br>one kind or another working in it my<br>question always is what's it like being<br>a cleaner in the museum what is toita<br>who I've met who's Simone what's her<br>life like and how well she's doing that<br>job for us so we go ladies and gentlemen<br>is what I'd like to offer you as my<br>point bearing in mind Winston Churchill<br>in a very historic week historic for you<br>historic in a really positive way<br>because from here nothing is the same<br>again historic for fena friends family<br>who've helped fund you joyful and I<br>suspect for the very good people sitting<br>too but thank you for inviting me to<br>come I hope the day is as joyful as it<br>should be as it deserves to be I wish<br>you very well in the careers that come<br>spectacularly so for leadership because<br>we need you you need to perhaps think<br>you can make less of a mess of it than<br>my generation did but I would say<br>actually we need we need you on that<br>equal footing right away now we need<br>your courage Your conviction your<br>integrity and thank you for listening to<br>tenu well thank you Mr clear for a very<br>interesting and uh times humorous speech<br>and he probably all as graduan reminded<br>that in fact it didn't finish today with<br>graduation that the next
