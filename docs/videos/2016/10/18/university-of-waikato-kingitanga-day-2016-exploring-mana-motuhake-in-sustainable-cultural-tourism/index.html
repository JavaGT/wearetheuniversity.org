Joe Neely thank you for<br>opening and come after us as well and to<br>our presenters kahoo family that our way<br>to avoid it all it's the privilege to be<br>here amongst everyone today my cocoa<br>puffs for today is about exploring mana<br>motuhake and sustainable cultural<br>tourism using a PhD study of waketh of<br>binary but those who were here last year<br>i also presented on kini than the base<br>so please bear with me as my corridors<br>very similar but i tried to incorporate<br>more of my findings into my research<br>today i also like to acknowledge my<br>supervisors sorry during in motown were<br>in sierra Jane hopefully for the support<br>throughout my PhD journey my a PhD ko<br>khabar is about investment and<br>sustainable cultural tourism planning<br>for the future benefit of wake up with a<br>new along the waikato river using skype<br>case studies at toronto huawei and<br>kalamata him moraine i'm currently near<br>the end of my three year PhD at the<br>University of Waikato and the goal of<br>this research is to help fund they make<br>plans for the long-term well-being of<br>the tribe through sustainable cultural<br>tourism<br>this doctor is guided by the words of<br>the seeker Marty King King porthgenna<br>Tavia Celtic poop Yahoo are careful way<br>to grow prosper and sustain which means<br>that we humans we need the natural<br>environment for long-term growth and<br>survival these words were spoken in the<br>18th century which proves that<br>sustainability is not a new concept it<br>is about what we as humans to choose to<br>prioritize when making money what is<br>sustainable to cultural tourism if<br>practice correctly sustainable cultural<br>tourism will provide excellent care of<br>the guests and the house it will care<br>for the environment it will help<br>preserve our culture it puts the<br>well-being of our people first such as<br>long-term employment at all levels and<br>it must be driven by ourselves alongside<br>partners as well for everyone and in<br>time help bring money to the tribe and<br>then to the country I think it is also<br>important to emphasize the difference<br>between terrorism and sustainable<br>cultural tourism as tourism alone can<br>potentially exploit host or indigenous<br>communities it can interfere with<br>traditional ceremonies such as tanayama<br>it can exploit the natural environment<br>control communities and prioritize<br>financial returns however sustainable<br>culture tourism it does the opposite it<br>challenges the conventional ways that<br>businesses manage and practice tourism<br>to prioritize the people the culture the<br>natural environment as well as financial<br>returns<br>prior to 1860 wake up will achieve<br>prosperity under the leadership of both<br>the third the fiddle fiddle the first<br>Marty King bikini Tonga was created by<br>all tribes to unite or a way to stop the<br>loss of land to European settlers in<br>1863 the government illegally stole more<br>than 1.3 million acres of rich fertile<br>land belonging to wake up Thor corduroy<br>pants ooh as a result of rope at su-wei<br>Cottle suffered heavily with thousands<br>of innocent men women and children were<br>killed by the colonial forces eager to<br>own our lens rape a to has meant that<br>wake up dog were denied the economic<br>resources to participate in New<br>Zealand's economy and reporter continues<br>to define the low socio-economic<br>positioning of the way couple people<br>today that open to settlement was signed<br>in 1995 21 years ago which is equivalent<br>to only one percent of the value of<br>lensed taken an 1863 y Capital was the<br>first Erie to settle with government<br>which has set presidents for other EV<br>settlements such as the naija who and<br>the two hoy statements however tourism<br>is one of New Zealand's largest growing<br>industries which can help me grow and it<br>reached 29.8 billion last year and is<br>forecasted to reach 40 1,000,000,000 and<br>by 2025 the main driver of tourists to<br>New Zealand is the natural landscape in<br>Maori culture however there has never<br>been any funding for Mardi tourism<br>development in the past despite that<br>the king is anger and the white of the<br>river are what makes the Waikato unique<br>however there is very little cultural<br>tourism in the white purple bikini tanga<br>and our culture our town are gifted from<br>our to Pune which is why it is important<br>to work with our people and work with<br>our mind not on top of them a big<br>challenge as well for he has been the<br>mainstream media who continue to portray<br>a negative portrayal of Marty this<br>sustainable cultural tourism will allow<br>us to share our stories about ourselves<br>many of you will know that tourism<br>initiatives are not new to Marty or<br>indigenous people throughout the world I<br>would like to share this quote from Sir<br>Robert Martha theatre nineteen eighty<br>heaven as an example which offers us<br>with opportunities to create initiatives<br>design developed and delivered by<br>ourselves Marty groups are really well<br>advanced in thinking about the potential<br>of tourism in this country and the vital<br>role they could play in this growth<br>industry Marty are very interested in<br>autonomy and want to run the own show we<br>don't want to provide a tacked-on<br>plastic Marty experience in the venue of<br>facilities belonging to others we want<br>to provide authentic experiences<br>learning experiences through which we<br>can learn to interacting with our keys<br>we want to put added value into the<br>visitor experience not to have others do<br>the Waikato River represents the mana<br>and Maori of the people and essential to<br>tribal identity spiritual and physical<br>being of the way couple que me queda<br>defaming here you can see the many marae<br>in the waikato which tend to follow the<br>flow of the wake of the river as the<br>river was once a vital source of food<br>water and survival for the people today<br>the river is no longer a food source for<br>the people as it is heavily polluted by<br>here's the current investments tourism<br>investments by the tribe with invested<br>about 40 million and to the novotel and<br>the airport about 20 million and two<br>divers hope Hamilton 25 into novotel<br>Hamilton and about 200 million and two<br>debates so one thing they all have in<br>common is that they are all commercially<br>driven only and they employ for a few of<br>our people and there's potentially<br>another commercial head child that's<br>going to be built in Auckland other<br>major investments by the tribe accept go<br>bust we we they employ a lot about<br>people but we've made investments in<br>2014 and took over are commercially<br>driven and are replicas of Western<br>concepts of development and this is the<br>graph developed by dr. cucuta a leading<br>demographer New Zealand to about the<br>well-being of like a pioneer over the<br>past 21 years since the settlement here<br>you can see how the prophets have risen<br>but however the well-being over the past<br>20 yet one years<br>the same this graph here was developed<br>by Professor grahame-smith about the<br>ideal optimum wellbeing for eV and here<br>you can see that the well-being is<br>growing as well at this maybe not at the<br>same rate but is growing and as well as<br>the profits so that's about making<br>investments with prioritized social<br>cultural environmental as well as<br>economic returns so my research findings<br>I've received a hundred percent support<br>from what I members interview towards<br>investment and sustainable cultural<br>tourism after 21 years of<br>post-settlement the pupil what now I<br>want social cultural environmental and<br>economic returns not only commercial<br>returns making money is the easy part<br>social cultural environmental economic<br>returns is the challenge which I am<br>confident that sustainable cultural<br>tourism can provide I think our people<br>have been extremely patient these 21<br>years to ask for these types of<br>investments this is not about<br>disregarding all the commercial<br>investments it's about starting at least<br>one investment that prioritizes all<br>those returns I think governance needs<br>to have faith in our people not to<br>always have faith in parker or tgh<br>governance to make money for us a theme<br>that was often raised during interviews<br>is that without the people there is no<br>roper to settlement meaning it is the<br>people's land and money not these say<br>and the people want mana motuhake where<br>the people are in control of their<br>destinies and not dependent on other<br>people to determine their futures I kind<br>of view this is another form of rape a<br>too but we are the we are the presses we<br>allow tgh to use the people's land<br>and money to fund their initiatives that<br>grows to their people not ours<br>furthermore in this research 14<br>successful monetarism providers have<br>shared their challenges and strengths<br>for a week to consider indigenous people<br>over the world have engaged in<br>sustainable cultural tourism which have<br>proven successful but yeah so yeah but<br>their mana motuhake is what I said on<br>the carbon here which represents the<br>coat of arms of wake up with Amy I<br>believe in order for mana motuhake to<br>truly exists for farming happy with a we<br>we need to prioritize these four key<br>goals across all tribal sectors<br>including governance investments and<br>operations only then would we see the<br>true meaning of Mardi or indigenous<br>autonomy so these tamatha the people<br>that they all the natural environment a<br>culture and the economy these are all<br>the same goals is sustainable cultural<br>tourism so my advice so far to erie and<br>tourism is to be fully committed and<br>competitive it will be hard work don't<br>be confined to cultural tourism alone in<br>this look at find out what i'm at the<br>most vital tourist demands in your<br>region such as boat cruises hotels<br>future tourism and do your homework do<br>your research and work together with<br>your people then invest in it or create<br>partnerships and here we throughout New<br>Zealand can add the unique cultural<br>also at the start of your three to five<br>year planning and construction of your<br>business immediately begin offering<br>scholarships to people and targeted<br>areas to fill key roles don't start this<br>vital process at the end when it is<br>finished otherwise you will have to look<br>outside for skilled staff and finally<br>make it sustainable I believe he will be<br>a major leader in the industry so my<br>dreams for every for the future had to<br>the aspire to the days of kini Botha<br>though and the days of our great eerie<br>liters which was only about a hundred<br>and fifty-eight years ago tribes had<br>mono more to hockey we were strong<br>healthy fluent Imperial Marty met walnut<br>the governor and owned most of New<br>Zealand's land and resources we were<br>highly educated in anybody wanna know we<br>were socially culturally environmentally<br>and economically successful we exported<br>overseas and employed our people these<br>are the days that is worth towards not<br>only for a couple but for all a weed so<br>these are the current direct benefits of<br>the research for Maury and OE but<br>basically the key ones is to improve the<br>well-being of the people including<br>komatsu camara key and future<br>generations to seek ideal local national<br>international partnership and investment<br>and to initiate investment and two other<br>sustainable indigenous industries such<br>as biofuel<br>maahi la dona mari art and carving in<br>sustainable primary industries and i<br>would like to conclude this presentation<br>for the words of princess Sofia Jeremy<br>mahima crimoya ho ho ho Ha Na ki mahima<br>acha muy muy atopic a fire-eater van</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
