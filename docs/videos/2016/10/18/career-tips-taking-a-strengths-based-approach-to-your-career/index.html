In this session, Business School Alumna Ashley Siddall illustrates ways you can identify your natural strengths, find ways to use these strengths every day and ultimately take a strengths-based approach to your career.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's great to be here tonight and I'd<br>like to status anything seizure by<br>asking you to participate in the various<br>side effects sir that for me if you<br>don't mind<br>slides a bunch of pictures and I'd like<br>you to take a moment to look at them<br>refused help on a Monday morning on your<br>way to work<br>day<br>appear on these pictures and if you<br>don't<br>so thank you for your participation<br>the reason I asked Athenian do not like<br>this morning this is because these<br>people look to me like they're engaged<br>employees in Gallup defines an<br>engagement ie is one who's emotionally<br>connected to the works in deeply and<br>future<br>and I think for us all<br>that's our desire in this stage of our<br>career we want to go to work on a Monday<br>morning and maybe give ourselves a<br>little time yes tea T IME thank goodness<br>it's Monday I'm excited about what the<br>weave poles they need of thing I'm<br>excited to make an impact to see my<br>colleagues in to do great things for our<br>clients in<br>and so why I bring this up is because<br>we're going to talk about how taking a<br>strengths-based approach to our career<br>will help us to get to the state where<br>today's agenda is going to cover four of<br>the main things we better start I told<br>you a bit about the New Zealand web<br>mates and engagement we're not going to<br>introduce you to talents and strengths<br>and you've got some exercises so I'm<br>really looking forward to<br>involved<br>the in step three we have a micro<br>approach I'm going to give you some<br>steeps and tools so that you can use<br>strengths every day and finally we're<br>going to go up to level and think about<br>how can we take a strengths-based<br>approach to our career so hope that<br>sounds like good<br>to you all and we'll start by talking<br>some statistics being about the New<br>Zealand workplace so actually when I<br>took the scientific part of the room I<br>said about a quarter of you seem to be<br>engaged employees it's pretty much right<br>on because Gallup statistics show that<br>77% of New Zealand employees are not<br>engaged at work<br>now what's this mean there might not be<br>as depressing as it sounds so we<br>classify people into three ropes so<br>we've got the engaged people who raise<br>their hand in response to these two<br>these are people who get excited about<br>coming to live be very membership to<br>their organizations and they look a<br>little bit like owners of a business<br>the bulk of people in New Zealand please<br>in the New Zealand statistics but most<br>of the world pretty similar we're not<br>particularly these are all worse than<br>most other countries so we have 62% of<br>people sitting in the middle not engaged<br>and these people may well be quite<br>productive employees they're making very<br>competent but they're not<br>psychologically connected to the<br>companies into the jobs<br>so these people are people that have a<br>clocking in and clocking out we're going<br>to find that you the New Zealand Herald<br>trying to pass the time but you wouldn't<br>look at them and say these overly fluid<br>excesses about the New Zealand workforce<br>people who are doing a fairly good job<br>at not permanence assignment or<br>connected to their job in the<br>organization<br>in the interfering large group we call<br>they're the people who are at work but<br>they're not really present it pretty<br>unhappy with their job and the company<br>that they work for and not only are they<br>unhappy inside themselves but they often<br>insist on the splitting mirror and<br>happiness to other people who may well<br>search in the engaged for much engaged<br>actually in New Zealand the majority of<br>people<br>goodness it's Friday you<br>know as I seat maybe people who who were<br>doing their jobs competently<br>people who are showing up but not really<br>showing up to work and then of course<br>colonies<br>you know cause they love each other<br>people<br>so why most of us not engaged and our<br>think about this often because we spend<br>most of our waking life at work so it's<br>a little bit sad that most of us aren't<br>engaged but I think there are a couple<br>of reasons first of all is always an<br>opportunity for us to have better<br>managers because the manager influences<br>about 70% of our engagement<br>but for almost all of us we don't really<br>have the opportunity to pick up energy<br>that's kind of something that gets given<br>to do we enjoy an organization<br>so thinking about what types of things<br>that can help us to be more more engaged<br>in our work need me to develop this<br>presentation tool in order to do<br>so I've brought you all pairs and penis<br>and<br>get out one side of the penis appear and<br>callous eyes eyelashes so using both<br>my community to help me win a bit of an<br>not apparent pets you can think back to<br>me your child's etc score even when your<br>University and UK moment in to or<br>semester with your report card so<br>pretend your child returned ever child<br>you as a child returns home the<br>following<br>part aids in English and social studies<br>a see and science to skinny by science<br>in a D or a Fagan great the next<br>on your piece of paper just to yourself<br>would you mind write it down which of<br>these marks who spend the most time<br>does a lot of polling and surveying so<br>unsurprisingly<br>we asked this question to a group of<br>parents and I'd love to get an audience<br>gives us from the options up here on the<br>screen what seemed to talk to hear us<br>see that it's been most of the time<br>focusing on the baby or the<br>child<br>likes of 77c so more than more than<br>three-quarters of parents would spend<br>most time talking to their child about<br>so 7 equals even see it when<br>three-quarters of parents would seem to<br>most time focusing on the area that a<br>child spending energy because from the<br>prior to the cubicle we devote more time<br>to our short times there to our<br>strengths<br>but<br>yeah it's established that will people<br>have the opportunity to use their<br>strengths every day these six times more<br>likely to be engaged and in work<br>something that's like logically<br>commissioners and emotionally connected<br>to be a job in our area in three times<br>so this made is made to the c-pen<br>decision<br>to start talking about the section in a<br>high place by addressing weaknesses<br>because particularly as New Zealanders<br>we like to talk about weaknesses immense<br>that we're not regret so with main<br>positivity is one of my top strength so<br>I like to keep this out of the way so we<br>can put out more uplifting plan so at<br>least<br>so a weakness isn't something that<br>you're bad at but weakness for something<br>that gets in the way of your success so<br>for me I'm a terrible swimmer I always<br>have been and even though my parents<br>tried to bribe me with McDonald's I<br>never got any better at swimming but<br>fortunately my job never and God's<br>swimming so this is something it's not a<br>weakness for me however if I was weak in<br>communication I've got really frightened<br>going to client meetings and talking to<br>people as for most other people in new<br>work this would be a weakness so we<br>often think about things with people say<br>what are your weaknesses a whole laundry<br>list of things that your badge it's only<br>a weakness if it gets in the way of your<br>job in your performance a<br>few strategies for overcoming a weakness<br>so that we can focus on Suri's if you<br>don't have to do it don't do it yet at<br>the mall rush<br>super may get just got enough so maybe<br>that's not an option for your child to<br>get MIDI and maths maybe they need to<br>focus and that attention so thank you<br>say that so that it pass at you but they<br>don't really need to spend all of their<br>time on because you know they're<br>probably never going to be an A+ student<br>ever so should air all my slides with<br>so in the workplace in particular you<br>can implement a partnership so if it's<br>something that you will really go - and<br>somebody else is not invite vice-versa<br>normal partnership with somebody because<br>unsurprisingly the things that we would<br>do that assist instructional process<br>rather than overwhelm us with a strength<br>to you a sports story about a golfer<br>that you were all probably heard of<br>called Tiger Woods he was interviewed a<br>few years ago by a sports journalist who<br>asked him what he thought as witnesses<br>start betting and title would see you<br>are not going to reveal that or my<br>computer's too to know so the sports<br>reporter decided to guess at what's<br>working a service based on years of<br>staking his game he said I think your<br>weakness is getting out of the sand I<br>can imagine that you must spend a lot of<br>hours practicing getting out of the sand<br>because that's your lane area where you<br>can improve in title what's it actually<br>you know I skim very little time<br>focusing on getting out of the sand and<br>practicing in the sand I spend most of<br>my life focusing on my drives in my past<br>so I don't get into the stand in the<br>first place and this is a perfect<br>example of taking what you wouldn't<br>building on those things so you're<br>exceptional and therefore not really<br>having to do what with a week at a shawl<br>or really because you've overwhelmed up<br>now Gallup has been researching people<br>in strength since the nineteen fifties<br>and sixties in dr. Donald reflectin one<br>of our psychologists did bunch of<br>research and what he noticed was in the<br>fifties and sixties there were thousands<br>of articles and publications on what was<br>wrong with people things like need to<br>well unless otherwise the salesman<br>control<br>there only a handful of publications and<br>academic articles on what was right with<br>people<br>as I see this<br>what will happen when we think about<br>what's right with people rather than<br>fixation on what's wrong with them and<br>from the scallops strengths-based<br>we'd like to ask you to participate in<br>another activity with me if you like<br>would you please raise your hand if you<br>always or almost always talk to people<br>pretty much where do you go in the<br>elevator<br>always or almost always gravitate<br>towards a familiar face a bit padding<br>about if you write down a must when<br>Sudanese step toward the suspects who do<br>what if you write down the list of<br>things to do in stuck to it even on<br>weekends<br>these things are actually things that<br>lose to your to your natural ability to<br>the greater plants<br>some other news too so we can start<br>about you things that you naturally to<br>forge record mastering we're getting<br>really good at doing something quickly<br>and then workshops you<br>follow you know that feeling when you're<br>kind of just in the zone and the sticks<br>come naturally to you don't have to<br>think about something it just that's<br>naturally<br>look specific service will you do<br>something and afterwards you think gosh<br>maybe sex fiction is I need to do your<br>so now we're talking talents on its name<br>but that about how your talent helps you<br>see the world so your talent it's kind<br>of like a pair of glasses a lens through<br>which you see the world so we all have<br>imports coming in various different<br>things coming at us we often have the<br>same things coming at us but because we<br>all have different filters or different<br>talents our responses and behavior will<br>be very different from one another<br>because we see the world differently<br>differently throughout our talent needs<br>and so we here today to talk about<br>strength so I want to explain a bit<br>about the difference between talent and<br>strength so we all all one what tap<br>which is a natural way of thinking<br>available behaving we can think about<br>this kind of raw in the over time as we<br>which base our talents become strengths<br>dam kasha perhaps as parents notice is a<br>toddler that he had really really above<br>average I had coordination for a toddler<br>in good balance but of course this is<br>not enough to get up to where peeve is<br>today so over the years he's a beast of<br>many hours and coaches<br>practicing due to the position is<br>so for most of us we are at the stage we<br>will you take an hour or until it was<br>where we enter our careers at that and<br>we've developed a mentored strength and<br>while there's always room fast to<br>improve on our strengths I'll be talking<br>mainly as through this presentation<br>organizations in New Zealand in globally<br>I've built on two flawed assumptions<br>there each person in women to be great<br>it always ended up in each person's the<br>greatest room for growth there's in her<br>some new areas of greatest weakness it's<br>a very logical plan to play our greatest<br>room for improvement as the<br>db2 a name I<br>like you it only pairs for me please<br>stop<br>by yes<br>so do it that's pretty uncomfortable I<br>mean enjoy it's not as natural as what<br>it would be if you use a memory behind<br>this light works like when we operate on<br>a place of weakness it's like we're<br>waiting up a string in the currents<br>running down and we wearing a bit<br>numbers as energy step oh it's<br>demoralizing<br>training<br>now I'd like to show you<br>another experiment stop us research<br>so this is based on a real study of<br>everyday we talk to people an average<br>reader will say that's myself and an<br>above average reader will say that smell<br>because she looks like she is really<br>fast<br>so we both do the same reading test and<br>I can really 90 words per minute and now<br>the above average reader can read 350<br>words in action then we both go through<br>a speed reading course same speed<br>reinforcement and we do it on the<br>written test now I improve myself watch<br>watch I go from 90 to 150 words per<br>minute on my second attempt it's very<br>empty any piece is about how many words<br>per minute now the above average reader<br>will be able to read after investing<br>this one down too late for me inside<br>yachts we focus a lot of time and energy<br>our child getting a D and maths we can<br>surely take them from a date let's see<br>but we focus on a strength this leads to<br>excellence so if we focus on English<br>you charge one eye open this could be<br>something at least in their school reps<br>will potentially even the visa Museum<br>and - or maybe world class as opposed<br>so as I said most organizations are<br>built on two floor assumptions you know<br>really love it if organizations would<br>start to be built on the to right<br>assumptions which are<br>each person's talents are endurance so<br>they don't change that much ephemeral<br>over time and unique to the individual<br>insipidly each person's greatest room<br>for growth is in the areas of this for<br>we move on to talking about how we can<br>use our strengths every day and<br>understanding some more specifics about<br>our strengths we might label ourselves<br>using our strengths<br>we can just tell you a bit about the<br>science of strengths so as I mentioned<br>our work has been going on but drive<br>details and around the world using out<br>all the Clifton strengths finder tool<br>developed by dr. dr. and by the way this<br>isn't the only strengths taught there<br>are other tools out there that you can<br>use to discover the streets or in hit<br>journeymen necessarily needed told to<br>the study of strengths and in to speak<br>reflect an effect on your career and<br>come up with what you think they might<br>be<br>15 million people know these dreams<br>throughout talk and really interestingly<br>for me New Zealand who even population<br>is a most strengths take this for any<br>country in the world so richly right<br>into what in the status must be fortune<br>500<br>it comes in the form of a book but you<br>can also take the assessment online but<br>we like to say that this isn't just just<br>about this is about a movement this is<br>what are our strengths assessment does<br>full names so I'd love for you to just<br>take a few minutes to read through<br>people really thought about putting in<br>language to your strengths and see what<br>leaps out at you as things that you<br>really think are your strengths and<br>welcome to use a highlighter at the end<br>from seen a bit of furious ha die<br>tonight please pep talk something like<br>that but then has definitely been<br>although I<br>do team to some people think that<br>Russians think I do they see the grace<br>hands<br>anybody else for machine what by meeting<br>the other groups have done and make sure<br>that gets<br>very tight<br>so people when they do their<br>strengths they'll often come back to me<br>and being really really worried because<br>they'll say oh no I've got everything<br>falling and the influencing back up the<br>same thing there I can't build<br>relationships<br>visit visit piece that I have one in<br>each bucket and we say no individuals<br>are pointing they have hard edges of<br>excellence that make us unique<br>but a team should be well rounded<br>so you really want to make sure we were<br>enjoying work<br>it's part of a chain that you've got all<br>of these cool<br>that's covered but you need not worry if<br>one of your strengths were top five<br>strengths four to one or two about that<br>for those of you who like statistics and<br>thinking you know the student star that<br>sounds good but what a certain mean and<br>for my performance or with the bottom<br>line a person is new so we've we've<br>studied us and this is a statistics with<br>individually but we also have this<br>profitable but we computed yes employees<br>we receive strengths based development<br>were found to have a variety of improved<br>performance outcomes the arranged so out<br>to eighty percent increased performance<br>which is based on performance ratings<br>product to the sales data to to teams<br>sent higher customer meet Travis<br>2270<br>higher employee engagement which we were<br>talked about in between the white tip<br>and citizenship which basically means to<br>participation its regular<br>activities<br>so strengths really does make a<br>difference for performance and they also<br>sort and the speed reading exercise and<br>just to explain<br>why is the range on that slide is<br>because you can have a variety of<br>strengths and dimensions so you can do a<br>strengths assessment to the study your<br>strengths and that will make some<br>difference to how you perform at work so<br>on this pace if you take the clubs and<br>strengths - strength assessment you'll<br>be about 20% is - and over with you<br>started in this life to leave your job<br>yeah but for organizations we they<br>created a strengths-based culture which<br>will be taking an assessment but in<br>Western culture having the managers have<br>strengths education city developing<br>employees based on these strengths<br>rather than pointing out what's wrong<br>with them and having to focus on the<br>witnesses chamber teams transitions so<br>getting an understanding of me everybody<br>sits in the team and knowing we these<br>strengths or<br>buckets we can speak soon to threats in<br>these pressure but overall<br>the point from the last slide is that<br>strengths is not just something that's<br>nice to do is lovely to talk about it<br>it's great to present on everybody<br>else's dreams but it really makes a<br>difference to our lives as employees<br>so - what I promise three easy steps<br>very simple not rocket science how can<br>we need to identify what they are<br>do we want to really understand them and<br>accept it unique so I might have context<br>scream is that<br>yes his context is a strength but<br>context was very different between the<br>two of us so what's unique to you you<br>need to understand what it means in<br>terms of your role in terms of your life<br>your experiences and of course I have<br>projects but I also have strategic<br>further his objects and he has<br>deliberative and because of the way his<br>strengths mix together in the way my<br>strengths works together the outcome<br>will rock very differently so once we<br>know what they are you spend time<br>understanding them might be helpful to<br>talk to your colleagues or to your<br>Scouts for sometimes with the Browse<br>me but we ask the people that we work<br>with and look what and they say that<br>it's totally you they just have a very<br>different perspective on food than you<br>do<br>indicate the type of mind so we don't<br>want to go to the energy of discovering<br>them and diving diving deep really<br>understanding them I need to put them in<br>the door so at gala we have our streets<br>and our email signatures and on our<br>desks you know on our doors and it's an<br>important part of how we interact with<br>one another so this on a day to day<br>basis I'm thinking how can I use my<br>summer for our final station and this<br>feature builds on season three so we<br>already know what our strengths are and<br>it stands on the top of mind so with<br>money without strings how might we take<br>a strengths-based approach to our career<br>so I've got some different suggestions<br>depending on what type you might be<br>allow you to utilize the strengths every<br>day and really introducing witnesses<br>so think about Tiger Woods if you can if<br>I'm a person who does relationship<br>building and communication reading a job<br>description for an analyst role that<br>says I'll be in Microsoft Excel all day<br>and life is not what a portfolio<br>because if we don't put a job<br>description<br>in fact that we can utilize our<br>in this will help to position you to<br>maximize your opportunity for success<br>not only for enjoyment<br>right to what you do everybody loves to<br>feel<br>if you're ready into your career but<br>you're considering a career change<br>looking at a card and picking out the<br>strengths or taking an assessment might<br>not be enough we go so what I propose is<br>that you look back on your career and<br>think about the moments and they might<br>just be small moments in your career I<br>mean you will most energized and<br>productive and ask yourself specifically<br>what were you do it<br>in the look it is stress profile and see<br>what mary exact what strengths were you<br>drawing on and you felt really energized<br>and engaged and maybe it was something<br>you only had an opportunity to do for<br>fire was need to be a job and that's why<br>you want to leave a change of career<br>so once you figure out what strengths<br>you were drawing on what skills you will<br>using that made you feel most energized<br>if you're thinking that you've already<br>identify to the field that you want to<br>work them in your you're okay with that<br>you know career change but you're<br>thinking about a company challenge we<br>want to be looking for as a future<br>employee you have a cultural and values<br>alignment work do they follow a<br>strengths-based<br>development approach or a weakness<br>fixing approach and other companies and<br>new zealand<br>started to develop their employees based<br>on strengths so<br>my brother recently was interviewing<br>from the spirit role as a solicitor and<br>he interviewed with a lot of difference<br>rule firms in England in one of the<br>questions that he got all the time to<br>the malleus introductory point was tell<br>me what your weaknesses are this is my<br>question it depresses me it was it came<br>up more than once this is probably not<br>the type of company that you want to<br>work for if you really buy into<br>following a strengths-based approach and<br>want to develop yourself based on the<br>strengths so look for an organization<br>that that really understands that people<br>can be at least in Britain reach their<br>highest potential by focusing on what<br>the other door - identify their<br>weaknesses in talking about him and<br>trying to<br>Pepa weaknesses<br>we're looking to improve engagement in<br>the current role<br>not reform complementary partnerships as<br>I touched on earlier will become part of<br>a team where you can make each other<br>more successful by all contribution in<br>your area of greater strength and you'll<br>find it surprising quite natural that my<br>strength in where I love to do it as<br>somebody else's weakness and something I<br>hate to do in vice versa so if you look<br>hard enough and get to know people in<br>your workplace you now find people that<br>you can pack around with and help one<br>another to be more successful I can't<br>this also requires us to appreciate and<br>respect people who bring different<br>strengths to the table<br>what we actually naturally like is to<br>work with people who are the same as us<br>because it's easy but<br>what we probably need to do is work with<br>people who are different to us so if I'm<br>one of those people who pushes the left<br>button to<br>revive the elevator<br>chances are high that I might be an<br>activator which is somebody who likes to<br>spring into action and get things done<br>my worst nightmare might be being<br>somebody being partnered with somebody<br>who stood in the brita these are the<br>people who are very thoughtful they<br>weigh our options in calculations they<br>think about before they move foolish<br>these two types of people might hate the<br>idea of being put together on a team or<br>a partnership but what a beautiful match<br>when you put together somebody who's<br>who's thoughtful and strategic into the<br>Great's but somebody's actually going to<br>spring forward and make it happen with<br>energy<br>so it may take some time for us to get<br>really comfortable working with people<br>who are quite different to us but it's<br>the normal situations<br>in<br>our<br>variation<br>well you are together with a bunch of<br>people your age at similar

need perhaps<br>one of mr. Musil in the world class and<br>recognize your strengths<br>build on them<br>find the right opportunity and<br>environment to use them so find a place<br>where your strengths will be appreciated<br>and finally something that we don't do<br>the knock off and you see us be proud of<br>your strengths your strengths are what<br>makes you unique<br>you will never met anybody in the world<br>who has the same top five strengths in<br>the same water as you the chance of<br>something like 133 of them so be proud<br>of the imodium understand them put them<br>into action in your in your work life<br>and from here<br>be very confident of success<br>- I would say thank you for this thing<br>for participation in my exercises thank<br>you everyone for coming we please give</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
