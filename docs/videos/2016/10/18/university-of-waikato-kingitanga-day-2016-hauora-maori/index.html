I good for<br>well it gives me great pleasure and this<br>morning to welcome you all here to<br>faculty of education and talks and today<br>this morning we're dealing with high<br>water multi multi health and and it<br>could we ever say gives me great<br>pleasure to introduce our two guests<br>because we have a third coming I'm sure<br>Tom I'm sure will be here soon but we<br>get we've got two very well informed<br>well very well known highly researched<br>people who are going to give our coho<br>today about high water molding I think<br>tahu called cuidate tahini a chorus<br>around it you know yeah okay to play so<br>Tahu cuckoo tires is our first speaker<br>and she has a wonderful history of<br>working in the morning world and Maori<br>health and she's going to give us<br>her talk about her perspectives on mardi<br>gras fat high water I'm not either<br>denmark win no my how to make a heart if<br>me totally economy kami aqui aqui aqui<br>hay te mete una para el carro aqui tata<br>kawaii o tamaki title you<br>really need more marketable natty<br>narwhal romantic in oaxaca et al voley<br>media yeah Tata teen alpha economy to<br>Mickey aquia coup<br>d'etat take that one<br>always a surprise when you think you're<br>going to be the last speaker in the<br>other first<br>is your speed reading your notes from<br>the sideline and some of you would have<br>done it no doubt with us<br>I'm actually not really a multi health<br>researcher I'm a population researcher<br>actually initially started off as a<br>historian then morphed into a<br>demographer and a sociologist so<br>actually the way I sort of approach my<br>research is pretty kind of<br>interdisciplinary and Oh Lee Roth talk<br>about Maori health what I'm going to<br>talk about really is multi wellbeing<br>for my fairly sort of broad based<br>perspective and then come into some of<br>the population researchers which is<br>really the bread and butter of what I do<br>at nidia which is the an Institute here<br>at the University of why couple want to<br>start off with a picture here of some of<br>my nieces and nephews in my in my<br>Michael to talk to me that's what kind<br>of mold well-being the future moldy<br>well-being looks like anyway I'm going<br>to show you a lot of numbers and graphs<br>and figures and all that sort of stuff<br>which I'll explain but I think it's<br>always important to remember that<br>actually under night underneath it is<br>for people and its really what matters<br>what do I mean by well-being<br>it's kind of an elastic concept that<br>gets talked about a lot without really<br>kind of defining what is meant by there<br>recently I was really he should be doing<br>a project with Linda smurflings some of<br>you might know she's a PVC moldy here<br>and very well known that the indigenous<br>world with new research methodologies<br>and we were doing a project funded by<br>now file of D'Amato materna called and<br>procedure the possible which is a really<br>cool title is it about sort of<br>aspirational research rather than rather<br>depressing stuff that we end up doing<br>for our bread and butter and one of the<br>things that we tried to contribute there<br>was understanding what what does<br>indigenous concept of well-being<br>actually me I mean we might know as<br>individuals and charitable what we think<br>well-being means but is it kind of an<br>indigenous world view of well-being and<br>if so what does that indigenous<br>well world we will well-being actually<br>look like so there's many ways you might<br>and back I'm trying to find out what<br>that might mean and one of the ways we<br>did that because we're kadhi mix if you<br>look at a whole lot of literature the<br>hundreds and hundreds of paper set of<br>individual non-indigenous well being<br>kind of prioritizing indigenous<br>academics to try and distill of there<br>are some sort of key concepts underlying<br>concepts of well-being what might they<br>look like so we went through hundreds of<br>journal articles encoded the man did all<br>the analysis and we came up with what's<br>really kind of these for underlying pool<br>of what well-being looks like regardless<br>of context this was looking at different<br>countries I was looking at different<br>people Sammy First Nations matey<br>Australian Aboriginals<br>American Indians moldy Asia Africa okay<br>so I called my father these are the four<br>principles that sort of co here and one<br>of them is freedom and that gets cooked<br>about in a variety of ways<br>so they can mean rights justice autonomy<br>in automated upon our justice there's<br>different ways of thinking about freedom<br>but the fundamental freedom as a people<br>as a key on a component of well-being<br>another one is balanced and often this<br>gives talked about in terms of harmony<br>balance a sort of equilibrium<br>relationship between people and vanilla<br>and wanna and the natural environment<br>and that is being a key part of<br>well-being<br>as indigenous peoples<br>another one this one hears about<br>surviving and thriving and one of the<br>things that kind of a common experience<br>really that binds indigenous experiences<br>the experience of Claude ization and<br>what's kind of underappreciated a<br>particularly contemporary health<br>research is what their impact of<br>colonization is actually had on<br>contemporary indigenous health outcomes<br>and so for me indigenous peoples and<br>I'll show you a graph just merely<br>surviving that experience as a as an<br>indicator of well-being but once you<br>survive what does thriving actually look<br>like and how far are we on that scale of<br>surviving to thriving<br>and the last one and this is probably a<br>key one<br>tomm liluah I easier not correct<br>and this is the key one as distinctive<br>identity if you no longer have your<br>distinctive identity your culture your<br>real<br>those things that make you who you are<br>as a people then how can you have<br>well-being so these are the four kind of<br>four components that came through and<br>what well-being looks like so I'm just<br>gonna just keep that in your kind of<br>minds while I go through this other<br>stuff so what is our history of<br>surviving actually look like I love<br>historical demography do quite a bit of<br>it so I find this stuff quite<br>fascinating hopefully you will too I'm<br>going to show you some grapes sorry<br>all right so this is kind of our amazing<br>decline in the covering is too is too<br>but see it's confusing when you got two<br>screens okay 11 might be bit easier but<br>here what our population numbers from<br>100,000 to 600,000 this is time along<br>the bottom so just focus on that one for<br>the moment<br>so you can see that 1858 actually move<br>back to 1840 it would be around 100,000<br>ok so I kind of missed out a bit of the<br>story<br>1858 up to 2006 I didn't have time to<br>air 2013 and you can see here that the<br>numbers are very very small and actually<br>about 1840 would have seen even more of<br>a decline ok and then increased through<br>there along here now the second excess<br>shows our our population share of the<br>whole population of alta at all<br>here you can see this very very rapid<br>decline here home from basically being<br>fifty percent of the time the signing of<br>the treaty I week before that of course<br>one hundred percent okay and then he<br>gets massive job mess of chopped now<br>that massive drop is what you've seen a<br>lot of indigenous populations okay and<br>it's not only a drop in excellent<br>numbers how many people there are but<br>also a message drop and the kind of<br>dominance that you hear on the<br>population your demographic visibility<br>so these are kind of big sharks have<br>massive impacts on indigenous people<br>it's not only in the past not only our<br>two points that I continue to have<br>reverberations in the present<br>now you might look at it and say okay<br>why does that happen what can explain<br>that there's a lot of things that<br>explain that okay that a common invasion<br>implosion and the context of ulti adore<br>the implosion of EV economies that<br>actually exist at the time of<br>colonization and why cuttle we know the<br>early imma stolen by putting disease<br>swamp eng slumping he was through<br>immigration case they've got a kind of a<br>combined a double-whammy effect not only<br>of increased mortality<br>through disease malnutrition<br>starvation linked to confiscation of<br>land at the same time you've got mess<br>immigration coming in so these kind of<br>to disable izing characters are<br>happening basically at the same time<br>trading a sort of perfect storm and<br>of course ongoing poverty which didn't<br>stop<br>here when these a lot of population<br>start to increase that continues on to<br>present days we view our no with child<br>poverty and those sorts of issues that<br>have been in the news on too much a<br>daily basis<br>so we survive do a lot at this point<br>with a star is it shouldn't we be a<br>starship on TV some other sort of less<br>promising symbol that with bex basically<br>the low point of multi population which<br>about 40,000 from about a hundred<br>thousand a very short period of time and<br>there are many commentators mainly<br>parker but also marty who kind of<br>thought will actually will be survivors<br>of people and that was kind of like that<br>drink of thinking about survivorship<br>within it became very evident in<br>particular in more recent decades that<br>absolutely we are surviving there's no<br>doubt about it we heading towards a 1<br>million mark but what does this mean in<br>terms of thriving the other key<br>dimension of well-being and<br>just because i'm a demographic need and<br>i just like to show you some other<br>graphs<br>as well as yeah we've gone through a lot<br>of major transitions and one of them<br>which you know which will certainly<br>affect all of your final as well as a<br>kind of fertility transition from having<br>many many babies and our final to having<br>very very few on average with overall no<br>exceptions so here you can see this is<br>the the green line as all female so<br>that's the whole kind of new zealand<br>average and the read one is moldy<br>females we don't have anything over the<br>eggs we don't have any data but the main<br>point here is we can again see that very<br>sharp decline okay so that's going from<br>on average about six PP pure woman down<br>to about just over two okay and that<br>happened in a very short space of time<br>in fact that was one of the most record<br>declines and fertility seen in any<br>population it anywhere in the world at<br>any time and it has massive implications<br>for far no and how we see ourselves and<br>the relation but not so much the<br>relationships we have but kind of the<br>availability of relationships and 11<br>really easy kind of illustration of that<br>is fine line but so in the past you d my<br>dead and all of us cousins we're fine ly<br>of some sort the kind of circulation of<br>pp tamariki around far no nearly always<br>related in some way you can do that when<br>you've got an average of six kids okay<br>now if you put an average of just over<br>two kids<br>the cultural meaning of institutional<br>finalize the Wanderers but the ability<br>to actually practice it<br>is squeezed a lot because you simply<br>don't have the children to be able to do<br>that it's just kind of one changeable<br>way in which our practices are infected<br>while he's largest shifts in the<br>population and it's my just kind of put<br>the Sun tangible tombs this is my my<br>husband's grandmother quia he stays with<br>us a lot zeit at the par she was a mud<br>formula of<br>17 children raised in a two-bedroom<br>house anahi butter and this is her<br>great-granddaughter who is one of one<br>so you know this and pray for the couple<br>of generations you've got this mess of<br>shifts okay and the same filename<br>and of course we're always on the move<br>multi love to move our tip owners moved<br>to you know to come from Hawaii to all<br>teodoro and we are always on the move<br>first he was I might like to think of as<br>the second moldy migration this is<br>probably a dream appearance maybe your<br>breaker insurance who moved from rural<br>areas into urban areas after world war<br>two okay in places like the hook young<br>are basically emptied out overnight<br>virtually emptied up overnight and you<br>can see that in all of the numbers and<br>again you've got that really sharp line<br>because it happened in a very short<br>period of time so Marty went something<br>are largely rural people too and almost<br>entirely urbanized people in a very<br>short space of time so you got to think<br>about what does that do to happen but I<br>in English structures okay it might you<br>might think about it and big tombs but<br>it kind of trickles down it has married<br>localized to fix as well<br>and of course we know that about 1 in 5<br>1 and 6 Mulder you live overseas<br>wasn't that a brilliant show the GC<br>fine piece of the<br>television on young and this is my Lisa<br>two nephews who were born and raised in<br>Australia so it's about 130,000 more now<br>but this in the last census about<br>130,000 moldy living in Australia<br>one-third of whom were actually<br>australian-born and more multi living in<br>Queensland then there are in 10 of New<br>Zealand 16 regions so this is not just a<br>kind of like a small side issue it's<br>actually a major transformation and jar<br>molding and so a population history<br>really is a remarkable story of back<br>from the brink and this is true for many<br>indigenous peoples<br>we're kind of demographic innovators in<br>a way so we've gone a farm survival and<br>to thriving mo but it's not entirely<br>clear how far we are on that thriving<br>mode we're talking a bit about that in a<br>minute<br>but it's also important like that<br>actually while we have some shared<br>common experiences we're actually pretty<br>unique in the indigenous world one of<br>the things that we have and native worms<br>have as well as we have a single<br>language okay so you're thinking about<br>that just think of distinctive identity<br>in about language revitalization make<br>sort of have a lot easier to achieve if<br>you've got one language not 500 okay so<br>it's a lever that's um that's<br>advantageous another one is we have a<br>very high demographic visibility which<br>felt get to so we're about sixteen<br>percent of the national population for<br>First Nations people American Indians<br>train aboriginals it's like one two<br>three pursuit you know and numbers<br>actually doing better and you're trying<br>to get political<br>fun little cheering<br>when you're trying to get some political<br>change it's a bit easier to do it if<br>you're a big share of the population in<br>a few little the population<br>all right so thriving or surviving so<br>people often say to me well how many<br>moldy are there and you know there's not<br>actually a simple answer to it because<br>if you look at the sensors which is<br>where they can't do the population count<br>there's lots of different indicators of<br>moldy identity there's no single one<br>which might sound ridiculous to some<br>people cause you to say what's a<br>Papa obviously it's the indicator of<br>moldy identity right but the way it is<br>counted in the census is very different<br>so exit out at the the biggest kind of<br>boogers most inclusive criteria is moldy<br>deceived there's a question that you<br>took this is are you of moldy just sent<br>will do you have a moldy grandparent or<br>great-grandparents and people going to<br>took that box so based on that question<br>there was about six hundred and<br>sixty-eight thousand multi in the last<br>census then there's another question<br>that says what ethnic group are you and<br>that's me to be like a cultural<br>Christian and based on that question<br>there was five hundred and ninety eight<br>thousand it's got 70,000 links is quite<br>significant yeah so there's that 70,000<br>people who say the parking our European<br>culturally ethnically but they<br>acknowledge that they have a moldy<br>ancestor there somewhere<br>and then we had a question on Eva do you<br>know at least one of your eerie yes<br>write it down smaller again at<br>535,000 and then if you took a core of<br>all people who say yes ancestral years<br>ethnicity yes even you've got a much<br>smaller but in the middle there which is<br>about forty percent so depending on how<br>you're thinking about it you can have<br>relatively small to a relatively large<br>population for a multi-perspective<br>probably descends as the best indicator<br>because that's one I'll just kind of<br> up our own away although it's not<br>connected to an earring<br>and the latest estimates about seven<br>hundred and twelve thousand mold in 15<br>towards a million which sounds really 6<br>i'm not really sure what it means I<br>thought I suspect it won't mean all that<br>much if surviving to thriving doesn't<br>change because it's all well and good<br>having lots of people<br>but if the quality of life isn't<br>improving and that's obviously a major<br>problem ok I'm going to race through<br>some other stuff so one of the things i<br>showed you did you know that reduction<br>and the number of babies that big<br>fertility decline that we hear means<br>that we've got a very different age<br>structure<br>and they're sexually is has some<br>important consequences on the right hand<br>side this is the park year age structure<br>is kind of like a soft edge here it's<br>kind of like shape down and what's<br>happening here is you're getting a lot<br>of people moving into the older ages<br>on the left hand side up at the modi age<br>structure with all these lovely young<br>people here<br>and it's more like a triangle yeah<br>because what you've got you've got a lot<br>of younger people at the base and fewer<br>older people at the top<br>now when you've got these two things<br>side by side what that creates actually<br>is an opportunity because when you've<br>got structural aging you're getting<br>increasing amount of people moving out<br>of the working ages okay an economy's<br>need people in the working ages to drive<br>the economy okay but for multi we've got<br>plenty of future workers you can drive<br>that economy but it's only kind of<br>really mean something if we put<br>meaningful investment into our i'm going<br>to hear and yes eva can do that but<br>actually it's a major government<br>responsibility and a lot of some of the<br>money that's been coming out of our<br>Institute particularly when Mickey<br>Jackson Wazir about is that we've got<br>this potential multi demographic<br>dividend that's been wasted through<br>policies that aren't investing where<br>they need to invest in order to really<br>benefit from this from this age<br>structure sitting alongside the sage<br>structure<br>okay so we're talking about that kind of<br>distinctiveness and I if you think back<br>to that model of freedom balance<br>surviving thriving distinctive identity<br>one of those might be seen as kind of<br>out our visibility what is our<br>visibility as Molly look like and we can<br>look at the national level with some<br>600,000 which is about sixteen percent<br>nationally but actually we don't live<br>our lives in the nation we live our<br>lives and communities and we live our<br>lives and regions and how how visible<br>Modi are very tremendous leader cleaning<br>action which part of old you at all<br>you're living in<br>so the read that they'd submit and that<br>by territorial authority there's about<br>sixty seven of them and the country but<br>all you really need to know is that the<br>meat areas means at least forty percent<br>of those areas are multi so it probably<br>confirms where you already know which is<br>that those mardis of high as areas of<br>high moldy demographic visibility and<br>the far north of the more to the east<br>coast and around here I think that is a<br>little peek<br>here on grew up eating and then 40 those<br>little those real diamonds which is<br>about 30 to 39 person that's South white<br>couple in little doer<br>yeah food and in the South Island is low<br>very low proportion of mold in the South<br>Island so we were talking about kind of<br>moldy like thinking about at a national<br>one-size-fits-all way is actually out of<br>step with this massive amount of<br>variation that we actually have across<br>the country<br>so in way at all you've got more than<br>sixty percent of the population is<br>Molly's Colorado or politically dizzman<br>and the far north if you kind of gone a<br>leverage distinctive identity and the<br>good things about to elm rd these were<br>the good places to do it and certainly<br>you've got much higher levels of TD all<br>speakers in those areas because you're<br>surrounded by a hata multi people right<br>area to me emolia basically<br>demographically invisible include<br>queenstown way monthly white 15<br>McKenzie and sell one with less than ten<br>percent of the population Amari so this<br>mess of massive differences in 10 so<br>very small country<br>I'm talking about education and that<br>kind of thriving we lot of you know<br>policy is around education and myself<br>I've said that yes education is<br>absolutely critical for realizing that<br>demographic dividend but again there's a<br>massive amount of variation throughout<br>not do as well so if we look at the<br>territorial authorities if we took one<br>indicator which is no no no education no<br>qualification it means no ncea level 2<br>or anything like that nothing<br>and you looked at moldy throughout the<br>country then the smallest the areas that<br>had the lowest proportion of Mardi was<br>with no qualification okay so another<br>another if you flip that over the areas<br>where moldy kind of well well educated<br>there's no surprises Wellington and<br>that's largely through migration you've<br>got a mess of public service moldy<br>population and well enter and they're<br>highly educated so if you usually come<br>from other parts of the more to to work<br>there there's nothing particularly about<br>Wellington your Queens that Queenstown<br>dunedin University of it can sell and<br>capital palmerston north university of<br>feet after half corridor Hamilton<br>University of feet in Christchurch so<br>those studies we've got University to<br>also often have higher levels of<br>education yeah now if you look at the<br>other end where are the areas we've got<br>high shares of the Moldy population with<br>no qualification whatsoever it's much<br>higher so excelled white couple photo<br>new stretford portofino southern<br>thailand like Igor mutton month up water<br>to hunger who are people in Whitehall<br>more now the interesting thing is a lot<br>of these are actually in the y Capital<br>Region's and so you've got this kind of<br>polarization of hemmed and with very for<br>Mardi with quite high levels with low<br>levels of low education in other areas<br>with high levels of low education this<br>is all within one region so again that<br>kind of wine one-size-fits-all is not<br>going to be particularly helpful that is<br>we really kind of mobilized for sponsors<br>to education I think role is it for the<br>educational settled without and just so<br>just to emphasize those two deputies<br>it's 15 to 45 that's a mess of<br>difference<br>so we've also got the usual gaps and<br>systemic inequities education labor<br>market income child poverty and car<br>serration to me to me to me I could go<br>on for ages about that but I won't<br>because you've already knowledge<br>so what about our distinctiveness that<br>other part of it well being<br>model that i showed you Leon's<br>video molly is an ongoing challenge<br>let's comes from a census and what it<br>shows is why ages five-year age groups<br>is a question of the census you might<br>remember that your folded out yourself a<br>mum and dad might have done it for you<br>which is and what language can you hold<br>a daily conversation so it's about<br>convertibility with conversational<br>ability into in any language Antonio was<br>one of them<br>in<br>1996 is the blue line in<br>2013 is the orange line so one of the<br>things that you immediately noticed is<br>that in most age groups the blue line is<br>a lot bigger than the orange line okay<br>so that means that these been a decline<br>over time the other thing that's really<br>noticeable is it as you go up the age<br>ages you get higher proportions being<br>able to speak video as well as leave<br>those two things now<br>most of the difference that you'll see<br>is over here okay so just put to put<br>that in a simple terms so Nick in 1996<br>you think that claimed our Telugu you or<br>Marty who were aged about 60 to 64 about<br>fifty percent could have conversational<br>kieriell yeah but in fast forward to<br>2013 and the same age group<br>only about twenty seven percent wasn't<br>decreased by heart could actually have a<br>daily conversation in the deal now why<br>might that be<br>when you think about it though is in<br>2013 new avenues kinda capricho marked<br>were ages with the ones who actually and<br>the earlier slide had gone finet rural<br>to urban transition okay and so<br>and it was also before the multi<br>Renaissance there's no there was no<br>opportunities to acquire that it all<br>through one manga through university to<br>other sort of educational initiatives so<br>these sort of cohorts that were stuck in<br>the middle of not kind of growing up<br>with with moldy as their first language<br>are kind of shifting away from those<br>institutions that would have enabled<br>that and then being kind of too old to<br>take advantage of those educational<br>initiatives so to a large extent we've<br>got these kind of rather large cohorts<br>of moldy adults now who didn't really<br>have the ability and the access to the<br>ill and ways when able those sorts of<br>blue lines to endure and part of the<br>policy response to that an alien<br>community response that it has to be<br>kind of acknowledging acknowledging<br>their and figuring out okay well then<br>how do we provide a pro age appropriate<br>ways as well to enable our commercial<br>and clear to have access to them part of<br>their identity as a party<br>it's a really interesting see if I<br>called the coop inner which was the<br>first Multi social survey and asked a<br>lot of questions about identity and<br>simple things like do you know you're<br>Mona do you know you're our do you know<br>you're happy do you know your EV and<br>that might sound like your basic<br>questions but there's nowhere else that<br>you can actually get some data around<br>neck sort of stuff so if you think that<br>you know distinctive identity one of the<br>basic measures of distinctive identity<br>is known we all forms of PBR then it's<br>really interesting to know that and this<br>has multi adults a case that's like 15<br>and above<br>and of course you've always got high<br>levels of eerie affiliation round about<br>an 85 to 88 the seat depending on which<br>survey you're looking at but huh boo<br>moma were only about half and you've got<br>half of Modi'in those surveys new to mow<br>no new there huh boo and you there our<br>and actually it's probably lower than<br>that because the survey didn't say write<br>it down okay just do you know but<br>actually if you had to write it down it<br>would probably be lower<br>connections between what I took on it<br>actually pretty still so pretty strong<br>seventy percent and none of the above so<br>no nothing is actually really low so I<br>think they're kind of needs to be seen<br>and they in the context of colonization<br>and kind of policies which actively<br>sought to<br>diminish moldy identity the fact that<br>this actually indoors is a kind of a<br>miracle actually and so whether it's<br>good or whether it's bad or whether it's<br>high or whether it's low it's kind of a<br>value judgment sit against watch I saw<br>see it as a really solid foundation for<br>increasing access and for building and<br>building on identity building on<br>knowledge at local levels then you kind<br>of got to start somewhere I'm I Tracy<br>the rest otherwise I'll take a foot we<br>were time Ross<br>now they say you know there's a lot of<br>discourse around this kind of opposition<br>between urban maldi and Ely Mallory as<br>if we kind of neatly fall into these two<br>different camps I think it's not a very<br>helpful dysfunction and actually it's<br>not one that actually has much meaning<br>and it doesn't have much meaning in a<br>way because more than eighty five<br>percent amarti actually live in urban<br>areas to a large extent we are all most<br>of us at you've been dwelling moldy at<br>the same time the vast majority of Maori<br>affiliate with an e we<br>if anything these two things are<br>mutually constituted rather than<br>oppositional and actually the greatest<br>growth and Ely affiliation has been for<br>molding who live in in areas so there's<br>kind of urban multiverses el Ahmadi what<br>has one that I think has one that needs<br>to be looked getting kind of<br>interrogating quite carefully<br>now when you're looking at any<br>population growth<br>it's quite a fascination because it<br>doesn't conform to any sort of model<br>demographic model that nerdy<br>demographers like to look at because<br>there's three things I might grow<br>population right in booths gets a<br>migration and as indigenous people she<br>largely had the migration effect are not<br>available because you're living in your<br>own home then is no other moldy land<br>that exists out there that we can get<br>mold ease from although somewhere argued<br>of Queensland's fast becoming that way<br>so you've only got you've only got the<br>leader really of Brits and deaths rice<br>you just want to have more babies and<br>you have gifts what's interesting for<br>Erie is that you also got another lever<br>and this is kind of reconnection with<br> puffer and reconnection with<br>identity and you see that really closely<br>I've been really evidently when you look<br>at some of the massive population growth<br>that's happened within with a lot of<br>Erie in the last 10 20 years that cannot<br>be explained by more babies and deaths<br>it's just simply impossible the only way<br>you can exclaim it is that people who<br>doesn't previously identify would there<br>be we subsequently do so why they do<br>that the number of reasons where those<br>person or whether its political whether<br>it's far know whether it's changing<br>context whatever there's any number of<br>reasons to explain it but the fact is<br>that this big massive growth so when you<br>look at why cut or 1991 from 22,000 and<br>there's an inn it's a stagnant and then<br>it goes up and then it goes down and<br>then it goes up again and almost doubles<br>what's it 21 years of course it's<br>impossible demographically impossible<br>there's no way that can happen it's due<br>to changing patterns of identification<br>and this line here is the settlement<br>okay 99 sex easier big surge after the<br>single month I mean down actually lost<br>numbers in the nothing in and it's one<br>of the fascinating kind of things for us<br>as Marty and actually similar patterns<br>for American Indian tribes as well is<br>that we have our own kind of rhythms<br>population rhythms that you don't really<br>see what other people and just to<br>illustrate selects four White Castle<br>eerie increase by eighty percent Maori<br>as a whole only 30 agency in New Zealand<br>only 26<br>okay and depending on which way you're<br>looking at is going to look different<br>women at nighttime why shuttle to avoid<br>not see our car in a new or different<br>there is no one ewee population pattern<br>again a one-size-fits-all it's not going<br>to be particularly useful<br>so the future we're heading towards 1<br>million Marty<br>surrounded million by truth 2033 which<br>is not that far off<br>if it sounds cool<br>and it sounds a lot but of course we've<br>got a very liberal immigration policy in<br>this country which molding have no and<br>put them to<br>and so the growth of migrant populations<br>is growing very rapidly not through<br>fertility but the migration and now in<br>the OECD countries we only seek and<br>behind Australia in terms of the<br>proportion foreign-born so you know<br>about twenty four percent of New Zealand<br>people living in New Zealand now born<br>overseas and straights about twenty<br>eight percent and Auckland that's about<br>forty percent and it's happened in a<br>very short period of time and has<br>implications I think moldy migrant<br>relationships are not well understood<br>i'm already here very little input into<br>migration policy<br>politically or any other way and it<br>raises a whole set of questions which<br>can play out very differently in<br>different regions I think and will<br>particularly be consequential for our<br>limit a team so I know sometimes I think<br>we're literature unsere and just kind of<br>looking at ourselves and not really<br>looking at the broader context and<br>what's actually happening in our tea or<br>a migration of the major one I don't<br>think it's particularly helpful to<br>approach it from a xenophobic Winston<br>Peters sort-of standpoint you know<br>there's lots of layers and new answers<br>to what these relations should look like<br>and I think we should really be at the<br>forefront of seeing what they are<br>so what is the potential that can be<br>harnessed from this critical mass is<br>obviously a lot of structural inequities<br>certain juror that need to be harnessed<br>has been a very kind of top-down<br>approach and I think you know the post<br>settlement context eva has tried to<br>address that in various ways but often<br>that's a very kind of sometimes it can<br>be a corporatized way there's a very<br>kind of top-down sort of know the<br>benefits might trickle down to the farm<br>owned and what a fine i won't very<br>convinced a bit so there must be other<br>kinds of economic models other ways ser<br>to nipomo and the audience have been<br>doing their own far no driven economic<br>initiatives<br>to harness the harness their potential<br>not just top down but bottom up<br>what are the challenges and one of the<br>other things i think is pretty important<br>and i look on my own file name and my<br>dad and his brother won one race and<br>patty hawker one reason to Don a way way<br>in between and they've got eight more<br>core and only one born nokia door you<br>know and it's just kind of the reality<br>the reality of farm owned so give them<br>their how do you mean how do you<br>maintain you know connectedness home<br>in that context of mobility is a big<br>challenge<br>and of course we've got these growing<br>regional differences so most of the<br>Maori population growth is coming from<br>that growth triangle auckland by a PT<br>wake up or ok that's where it's being<br>driven while cuttle eva is lucky we're<br>in the right in the middle debt growth<br>triangle but obviously there's lots of<br>variation like we showed me education<br>within the bucket or region as well<br>we've got Dignam regional inequalities<br>and we've got the end of growth in many<br>areas which is<br>irreversible<br>largely irreversible and so what does it<br>go what are they going to mean for EB<br>living in those in those areas where<br>population decline that's about to<br>happen already heaven is going to deepen<br>know if you think about that kind of<br>relationship between poplar and<br>fewer other people might be able to move<br>out of the region and finally move out<br>of the region but the basis of the hapu<br>and Matt I and II be identity always has<br>to be linked to place in some form<br>so what are the challenges and how to<br>meet them<br>so just the last like concluding<br>thoughts<br>you know and then the broader context<br>kind of balancing that growing clicked<br>of moldy roll with there's increasing<br>and equalities within 20 moldy and with<br>an old teodor's really important how to<br>do that how do we continue to maintain<br>our Maori distinctiveness and that's<br>this record my braciole within their<br>ethnic change<br>how can we continue to be both local and<br>global people<br>we want to be both should we have to<br>choose do we head to statues it<br>and those prices are kind of population<br>economic renovations and ongoing process<br>you want to keep changing it's going to<br>keep changing things don't stop get<br>fossilized sometime but how can we be<br>one step ahead and kind of anticipating<br>that change in the implications that<br>befall out of it so I'm sure it was much<br>transitions the rough going from<br>national mr. kind of perspective as Ross<br>going to repeat go on this one and<br>experiences and research into<br>Molina the theater clean only<br>killer richard t hey mario de email<br>Marta work out a who he named it all<br>wrong at aramark nom ET nous ET Otto qot<br>may me a ticket on 00 t guac dinner tato<br>katoa<br>so I am one of those imports that though<br>was talking about i come from place<br>called horsham<br>in england and<br>we don't really have a manga in in<br>sussex we have what we call the dance so<br>many of you will know awesome downs just<br>out of Hamilton but my mama really is<br>here shank tenbury Hill which is<br>actually an old Roman<br>temple site on the top of the downs my<br>hour is the the river Aaron which comes<br>from horsham down to the the south coast<br>and erindale castle is the castle that<br>guards that our<br>from invasion from the French and my<br>people were South Saxons from Sussex and<br>my mother's family have come from<br>villages in farm workers from that<br>region my father's family came from the<br>north north area Norfolk or the North<br>sexins so I I'm really talking on a<br>heart perspective on<br>how order Marty and particularly how<br>autumn re research in my research over<br>those years I first came to New Zealand<br>in 1981 which seems just like yesterday<br>but is I realize a long time ago now i<br>worked at tiki witty hospital when we<br>had three surgeons there and a physician<br>and the missus and how surgeons and I<br>worked for John manda know who was the<br>medical superintendent and as I arrived<br>fresh off the plane from England I was<br>given a<br>20-page document to read on tujunga<br>practice for Marty written by a young<br>medical student called dr. David Tiffany<br>leak<br>who I have to say was a great<br>introduction and one of my abiding<br>memories are working at took witty back<br>in nineteen eighty one was<br>the privilege of going to weave in<br>session with rangamati a edit and<br>learning about Marty weaving well that<br>was just so inspirational as I didn't<br>realize how privileged I was until I<br>went to a British Museum it's for this<br>exhibition a few years ago of her<br>weaving in Britain and that was a<br>fantastic opportunity so I had to go<br>back to England shortly after that with<br>my mother being ill but we so love New<br>Zealand that I applied for jobs I was<br>rejected from Tolaga Bay<br>but I was offered a job in water so I<br>came out to wider and I see that was top<br>of the statistics for a Mardi community<br>on the East Coast in<br>1983 there were 13 and a half thousand<br>people in guardo is now less than 9,000<br>but it was a fantastic experience for me<br>this is my fourth child Stephen who was<br>born in white oh so that is his to<br>romolo I and he's now teaching in in<br>Wellington and I worked in general<br>practice there and then became<br>superintendent of the of the hospital<br>and obviously with the soccer team MRI<br>there and<br>heart place of nati Cano knew they were<br>very much part of the governance group<br>of the hospital and Lena Manuel was a<br>colleague and friend on that time and of<br>course we spent our time<br>they're not only in wider but going up<br>into the Yoda wettest and white cat in<br>marana and really learning about<br>the region and its people and I have to<br>say that this is where I was converted<br>from being as general practitioner to<br>being a public health doctor I spent<br>most of my time writing letters about<br>housing conditions and water conditions<br>and all of those other things for my<br>patients in water rather than dishing<br>out lots of antibiotics for school sores<br>and worrying about a rheumatic fever<br>that was so pleasantly so 1988 I came<br>back to the Waikato as superintendent of<br>community services in district hospitals<br>took over from Rex Wright Sinclair<br>and of course it probably didn't realize<br>that it was unusual there we had a chief<br>executive Glen garlic who was Marty<br>deputy chief executive was Wayne mcclain<br>and so very much the Health Board was<br>very much a hospital board at that time<br>is very much aimed at dealing with the<br>health needs of Marty so Glenn<br>supported my first research project<br>which was a project looking at<br>undiagnosed diabetes in Marty and rural<br>communities within the Waikato and we<br>did that at a community development<br>program we went to three communities we<br>engage with those communities around the<br>issue around diabetes and then we set up<br>in conjunction with those communities<br>screening programs we started at<br>Matamata and water and we're very lucky<br>that that opening day we had that<br>Minister of Health it was having Clark<br>at the time it was a freezing July day<br>and she had a finger pricked and we had<br>Burton plan<br>that was a tremendous opportunity and<br>then we went to WoW him arrive again<br>another abiding memory was the support<br>we had from de theatre Danny Carter who<br>was came and supported us in our<br>endeavors about dealing with the issue<br>of diabetes for Mario I mean she<br>supported our program right through that<br>tamasha and PI Hall who the nurses down<br>in to Damien hi rang a wrong our clinic<br>as well as running diabetes services are<br>down there I mean this is Susan Ryan who<br>is now the head of the diabetes service<br>here in the waikato but was very much<br>the project manager so we showed through<br>that project this is undiagnosed<br>diabetes which was very a small problem<br>in pacquiao around one percent but six<br>percent of our Mardi people that we<br>screened at that time had undiagnosed<br>diabetes<br>and we also looked at the proportion of<br>people who were visiting a doctor so<br>this was a community survey we we met<br>people on my and in other community<br>settings and one of the things we ask<br>them is about have you seen your general<br>practitioner so europeans were fifty<br>percent more likely to have seen a duty<br>p in the last year than Marty men were<br>much less likely to go and see the<br>doctors we know smokers interestingly<br>you think smokers would be sick and go<br>to lid up for all the time but in fact<br>smokers with thirty percent less likely<br>to go to their doctor because they get<br>nay about the helm so there was a really<br>important project I'm proud of that<br>project because we left behind the<br>diabetes service that's now probably the<br>preeminent diabetes service in New<br>Zealand we have more diabetes nurses in<br>the community than any other health port<br>in the region<br>and I went back to the UK and wrote that<br>up as my doctorate and then got stuck<br>back in the UK for longer than we<br>expected but came back to Waikato in<br>2005 and at that time the Tyr owner<br>diabetes prevention strategy run by<br>david simmons was been running for<br>around two years it was on its fifth<br>project manager and I think six or seven<br>staff had come and gone and so we tried<br>to re-invite alized what was in fact in<br>vision of fantastic program and again<br>had engaged the community right across<br>the Waikato about not only<br>undiagnosed diabetes but actually the<br>most important part of it was to try and<br>prevent the developed diabetes for Marty<br>that project ran into a number of<br>problems and having to talk about those<br>but it certainly gave me a lot of<br>learnings about how not to do things as<br>far as research super mario concerned<br>but again one of the findings this is<br>undiagnosed diabetes Justin Maori<br>showing that it's higher rates in men<br>compared with women but very similar<br>rates to what we found a few years<br>earlier and then we went on to do some<br>loyal work with Gracie ossory who was<br>our PhD student at the time and looking<br>at diabetes in the general population so<br>this is known diabetes this is not the<br>undiagnosed diabetes and this is showing<br>by now this is in 2009 the rates in<br>hockey have around ten percent in those<br>over the age of 60 but this is the rates<br>of diagnosed diabetes in Maori so forty<br>percent of those in 70 plus<br>living with diabetes and over twenty<br>percent<br>60-plus so huge issue that's still<br>around well being of the population and<br>a huge disparity between Maori and<br>non-maori around rates of diabetes<br>so with our learnings from tyr owner the<br>next project that we were involved in<br>was an HL see another HRC project<br>looking at funnel order approaches to<br>health which were back in 2008-9 were<br>relatively new and we were exploring<br>within the Waikato dhv<br>concepts of how to deliver fun and water<br>and we were asked to evaluate that so<br>in conjunction with to Pune Alana the<br>Maori health unit that the waikato<br>district health board and Wayne Johnston<br>was a<br>worker and researcher within the unit at<br>the time so Wayne led that project<br>and i worked with jackie kidd and here<br>we have k Berryman and erin okada and<br>robert e blundell were also involved in<br>that project working with this funnel<br>water approach and i have to say most of<br>those fun water workers were those who<br>have been workers on the t y donor<br>project beforehand and carried on in a<br>different role that with the from that<br>project we published a paper around the<br>funnel water approached the health care<br>based on the who you that we've had with<br>co matra a draw our our clinic and from<br>that aranur and the team then developed<br>a framework for<br>researching and evaluating fellow older<br>programs using what we've published and<br>pulled it to call away<br>approach to<br>evaluation looking at those key guiding<br>principles of Health for Marty that came<br>out of those<br>Hui with our Kamara who guided that<br>process and we have used this framework<br>for further and research and evaluation<br>of other health projects<br>the next really from working with<br>diabetes and then got into issues around<br>cancer and death and dying I had a dot<br>Smith who was a local GP who wanted to<br>do some research and palliative care and<br>as car who says I have an interest in<br>rural and rural health for my time in<br>water and so we did a research project<br>with rural GPS around palliative care<br>needs and particularly for Marty very<br>much guided by friend and colleague<br>padatha Minato who had published widely<br>on this in the 1990s and was a great<br>mentor on supporter for me and that<br>really then led to the opportunity when<br>the HRC put out a bid for a study on<br>health literacy and palliative care to<br>work in conjunction with our are again<br>and putting it a bit that and we were<br>fortunate to get that that was a really<br>interesting process having gone through<br>the T y'r donor program I was very keen<br>to make sure that we were supporting<br>rather than leading projects and so<br>laggy Mahal already who was the man who<br>is the manager of raw our became the<br>lead investigator for that project<br>supported not only by me but by Jonathan<br>soul and Mary Simpson from the managing<br>school<br>first thing that struck me was normally<br>if we send an HRC project and get<br>funding you know they just signed the<br>contract for our hour they had to go<br>through a due diligence approach so they<br>had to show that they had insurance for<br>10 million dollars in case anything went<br>wrong they had to have an audit of all<br>of their financial affairs before they<br>were allowed to take up this grant so I<br>think at the end of it langham ahora was<br>thinking why am I doing this but the the<br>bureaucracy for Marty to lead these<br>projects were certainly the structures<br>weren't there but it was a very<br>successful project and then had<br>certainly<br>informed the ministry around the<br>information needs and health needs for<br>Marty around palliative care<br>following that we were lucky enough to<br>get into further research around fans<br>from primary care and need to<br>acknowledge that the team particularly<br>here in Nina's Scott who is our Mardi<br>physician with the public health unit at<br>waikato district health board and Nina's<br>been our Armada guide and adviser<br>royalty blundell who at that time was<br>leading the the Maori support group for<br>paper Kiki the Cancer Network and of<br>course creates at the frontier who's<br>been the manager of our our project<br>I'm looking around the project so<br>everybody knows this is sep tember and<br>that it's blue September so our first<br>project was of course around prostate<br>cancer so all the men who are 50 plus in<br>this<br>room I hope you've had your<br>visit to the doctor<br>but certainly that<br>project funded by the HRC a game was<br>looking at access and treatment around<br>prostate cancer really to look at<br>improving care but one of the issues<br>that we looked at was the issue on<br>equity so you can see here that<br>first of all Marty nineteen percent of<br>Marty at diagnosis already have terminal<br>disease they have metastatic disease<br>that has already spread which is twice<br>as many as New Zealand Europeans so<br>mostly young people have localized<br>disease but we have a number of people<br>who have metastatic disease at diagnosis<br>and many of these were Marty and by the<br>time we came to try and interview<br>Marty men with prostate cancer many of<br>them are tragically already a died and<br>that's because people with metastatic<br>disease<br>75% will be dead within three years and<br>so it's really important to catch these<br>conditions and cancer early and get<br>early diagnosis and we looked at the<br>uptake of screening between Marty and<br>Pakeha and found that Marty were half as<br>likely to be tested and half as likely<br>to be screamed as non-maori and so there<br>were huge disparities there around the<br>screening rates but not only were the<br>disparities around screening but if<br>Marty had a abnormal test<br>here are the rates of people being<br>referred so you go to your doctor you<br>have a test if the test is that normal<br>then you should be referred on<br>specialist for further investigation we<br>found that Marty were less likely to be<br>referred if they had a positive test and<br>if they got to see a specialist then we<br>found that only<br>fifty six percent of those who got to<br>the specialist were given a biopsy<br>compared to sixty-five percent of non<br>money so they're differentials in the<br>management of treatment but if you did<br>get there did get investigated actually<br>Marty were significantly more likely to<br>be diagnosed with an underlying castle<br>there are also not only differences in<br>that management pathway but also in the<br>in this form of treatment it's being<br>used so Marty were less likely to have<br>surgery or prostatectomy are more likely<br>to be treated with radiotherapy and this<br>is what we call watchful waiting or<br>active surveillance which is a<br>non-interventional monitoring of people<br>and then only treating business people<br>are progressing and we found that Maori<br>were fifty percent more likely to be<br>treated with conservative management and<br>this all leads to the disparity and<br>outcome so that this is the overall<br>disparity for Marty so Mari are twice as<br>likely to die from their prostate cancer<br>if they are diagnosed but if they're<br>diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer<br>then there are three times more likely<br>to die that non-mining so big<br>disparities that we've shown in the<br>management and outcomes for Marty's<br>across<br>our current project is looking at breast<br>cancer and again very similar graphs to<br>prostate cancer Marty twice as likely to<br>die from breast cancer<br>with the New Zealand Europeans again<br>differences in management so Marty<br>there's a gap there's the average gap<br>for treatment for puppy r is 36 days but<br>for Marty and take days longer 44 days<br>and through Pacific it's even longer<br>forty forty eight days Marty are more<br>likely to be treated with radical<br>treatment of master debt mastectomy less<br>likely to have breast conservation<br>surgery and are more likely to need<br>palliative care or go or have no surgery<br>and because they are diagnosed later<br>with more advanced disease<br>mari are less likely to<br>have their or continue with their<br>adjuvant hormonal therapy that prevents<br>recurrence of cancer so eighty percent<br>of pocky har at the end of one year<br>we're still taking that endocrine<br>therapy but only sixty-five percent of<br>Marty so all of these things add up<br>incrementally to differences and of<br>course the other issue is around<br>screening we've seen the differences in<br>screening for prostate cancer there's<br>also differences for breast cancer so<br>sixty-five percent of sixty-four percent<br>of Pakeha who are eligible for diagnosed<br>in the screening age group are picked up<br>through screening but only 52 second<br>party so mario left like we screened up<br>for pacific even less than four<br>but the big lesson here I think is that<br>if you are picked up through screaming<br>the outcomes for Marty are exactly the<br>same and that's because our national<br>screening program has an audited program<br>that ensures equity of management and<br>treatment for all patients victims of<br>that scheme whereas if you're picked up<br>opportunistically with a breast lump and<br>referred into the public health system<br>then Marty do much worse than on Marlene<br>in our current system and so we really<br>need to do something about improving<br>those outcomes and you can improve<br>uptake of screaming and my friend<br>employee<br>Rachel Thompson to GP de caja and define<br>our tarp nuit she has shown that you can<br>increase screening rates Marty from<br>thirty five percent to ninety-five<br>percent just through a community<br>development approach and through Alvin<br>of Democrats in that screening and she<br>published that paper a few years ago and<br>its continued to have those very high<br>rates demonstrating that the disparity<br>in screening can be addressed<br>so that's really just a run-through of<br>my journey and Marty research it is<br>still continuing I think what I hope to<br>do as a public health physician is just<br>highlight that needs and the disparities<br>not only an outcomes but in management<br>and treatment and show where the<br>opportunities are for of dealing with<br>that I think I've enjoyed most success<br>when we've really had that community<br>involvement in our research<br>being<br>co-design of our projects and work with<br>the communities whether that's been with<br>diabetes with our funnel water work or<br>without palliative care group<br>one of our challenges is supporting body<br>researchers to do this research and<br>we've had Wayne Johnson and writing or<br>both really early stage researchers<br>being supported by our team and we need<br>to build capacity of more<br>Marty researchers in the health field<br>and we have some of that going on at the<br>moment we have some really excellent<br>young Marty clinicians in Waikato<br>Hospital who are doing their PhDs<br>and we do need to explore further<br>palpable Marty research and research<br>methodologies to give different<br>paradigms to our learnings about how we<br>improve<br>outcomes and care for money we have got<br>a lot of work still going on we still<br>are finishing off a further breast<br>cancer proposal<br>we have a Marty student doing his PhD on<br>health literacy for women with breast<br>cancer and Timothy can't be here today<br>because is in one of the other sessions<br>I think giving a talk we have a mighty<br>researcher model worker who is starting<br>to do some work on myeloma she's a<br>specialist in hematology and my belief<br>that we'll have a great future in<br>research once she gets the special for<br>exams out of the way which placing her<br>at the moment we've just put in a<br>bid for study on long-term conditions<br>particularly around diabetes again with<br>Brendan referred to and the d'marie<br>research unit and<br>and J tomatillos another model physician<br>at the hospital will be leading on that<br>we're putting in a hero I around lung<br>cancer research and again we're looking<br>at wanting to do a community development<br>approach to that and Jackie kid and Rory<br>and ourselves are working with the True<br>North foundation to put together a<br>study and a program for supporting Maori<br>men with prostate cancer which is<br>getting funding as I say from the<br>Movember group so a lot of further work<br>to do I'm really excited by the<br>opportunity for tahoe and Nidia<br>we had the choice of going first or<br>second alone the wrong choice I should<br>have gone first really hard to follow<br>such a great talk from tahoe but i think<br>they know there's lots of synergies and<br>how we can work together to<br>further the agenda for my health so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
