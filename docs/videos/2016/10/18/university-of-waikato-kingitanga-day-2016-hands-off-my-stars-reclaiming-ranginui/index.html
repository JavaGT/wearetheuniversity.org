you<br>they had to rush off to something urgent<br>in that in China<br>so you're stuck with me oh<br>I came up how to keep their luck with<br>then I'll people broke the car who you<br>gotta keep or heck what I'm not cede<br>over your ghoultopia<br>better stop mucking around and do<br>this year for Mata ki I ended up doing<br>61 different presentations across the<br>country in a three-month period and i<br>thought i'd finished<br>but because of the unavailability of<br>others today you are number 62<br>unfortunately for you but i'm doing<br>something a little bit different it's<br>something that's really gotten under my<br>skin in the last couple of months<br>particularly since I've started talking<br>about my Fetti key and releasing some<br>some called it all that is really part<br>of 20 years of research I'm going to<br>tell you where my knowledge base comes<br>from first I'm going to start there I'm<br>going to tell you a little bit of called<br>a talk about where i get my knowledge<br>from then i'm going to move into how the<br>stars get in the sky because pretty hard<br>for me to talk to you about astronomy<br>until you understand how we believe our<br>stars get in the sky i'm going to focus<br>a little bit on my 30 key and then i'm<br>going to talk to you a little bit about<br>the thing that's really bugging me about<br>the space i<br>always start my presentations by saying<br>this is not the only version<br>hey this is not the only version this is<br>this is not the only version and there<br>are tribal differences and there are<br>variations and I think that's really<br>important for us to realize that people<br>may out on ear Popo on and if you<br>disagree with me cut by car by the<br>quarter or that you have and the<br>corridor that I have may not necessarily<br>be the same thing the most important<br>thing is that we are able to talk about<br>these things we're able to debate these<br>issues and mile we are able to leave it<br>and that's really the<br>guts of what I want to talk about<br>so Marty astronomy I think everyone<br>thinks that money keys the only sky star<br>in the sky and that's the only style we<br>talk about mother that's it ok we have a<br>record of over a thousand Maori names<br>for the different stars and the vast<br>majority than being identified where<br>they are what they mean when they rise<br>when they see we are never seem to talk<br>about money there's a real imbalance<br>with our Mardi astronomy<br>also everyone thinks<br>they were only used for navigation<br>ok we think all you know we navigated by<br>the Stars we did but that's only one<br>very small<br>narrow field of astronomy we planted by<br>the stars we garden by the stars we<br>hunted by the stars there are stars that<br>tell you<br>when you should travel there are stars<br>that tell you when you should have<br>relations with your wife<br>seriously<br>part of what we're doing is we're making<br>it more least our apps you know we hold<br>it up and you can tell the mildest<br>Arlene and the constellation Oh<br>I<br>hope you enjoyed your ride on the golf<br>cap<br>so there are stars for all cut types of<br>things all kinds of occasion is even a<br>start to tell you when you should be on<br>my show it to you later on when you<br>should be having relations with your not<br>your relations with your wife or your<br>husband and it's a big<br>as for our movie is the name of this<br>and you know I've been thinking to<br>myself how do I show that when someone<br>gets there pouting illigal there's a<br>what girl Nezzer it's a coup modern home<br>no do I the one do I disguise it and put<br>anyway what I guess I suppose I I'm<br>trying to stress here as navigation is<br>one very very small component and they<br>didn't never gate by a lot of stars they<br>only had a deep knowledge of a select<br>few Stars to navigate so I think<br>navigation and modernity there's so much<br>more about maldi astronomy<br>hello our ancestors were absolutely<br>incredible with your ability to view<br>things in space this site was so<br>unusually strong that they saw more<br>stars than weekend this is killing zone<br>he asserts that he could prove that the<br>natives could see the satellites of<br>Jupiter with the naked eye what he's<br>talking about he's talking about the<br>moon's traversing the face of Jupiter<br>with the naked eye and as unbelievable<br>and he tested them over afford a full<br>night period with his telescope it was<br>in the far north and he'd say yep<br>tonight year there is three moons to up<br>here one down there and he could see<br>them and in the next night he tell them<br>when the times they traversed the face<br>of Jupiter that ability your eyes are<br>like a muscle<br>and I'm not too sure why I'm doing that<br>but your eyes are like a muscle and if<br>you spend all day staring out across the<br>open plains were cross the oceans or all<br>night staring into space your eyes<br>become a custom then you begin to pick<br>up things that we have no ability to<br>pick up now because we we watch things<br>in front of our nose you know if sky we<br>watch us on our television we have lost<br>that ability to pick out these really<br>really detailed things in space and our<br>ancestors were phenomenal<br>and<br>there were schools of astronomy outside<br>every important village and the hunger<br>would go in there with their students<br>from sunset to sunrise now there's a<br>number of records of these buildings see<br>you Katie a cheeky aqua shape<br>Shay's people had a funny one and a set<br>aside for astronomy that was on dropping<br>we have one had one in my own community<br>and it was the walls but no roof so they<br>still lie there and look up at the stars<br>night after night so these things<br>existed and I want to start this with<br>showing you talking to you about<br>where my knowledge base comes from I'm<br>from here this is just a couple of<br>in the year 1898 you'll all know this<br>person in the middle there was a speaker<br>speaking in here this morning that's his<br>elson biss was in them they went up in<br>the<br>why he spent a number of years the earth<br>his main informant was a man by the name<br>of to Tacoma ho Coutinho was a very<br>well-known poner<br>tu taka na ho spoke to else investin bc<br>to look at what i really want to write a<br>book on Marley astronomy where do I go<br>and he sent him to these two men de coco<br>and then son well we did the cork oh<br>they lived in a funny pune next to this<br>funny new here down the bottom of the<br>hill there and<br>they were her cork wall hanging<br>that's the proper word for astronomy we<br>used this words that they are the waggy<br>cork or Dagny means astronomy that's a<br>proper phrase and if the owner call<br>Kourtney is an astronomer<br>so these two were talking to Kourtney<br>and<br>they turned up to best to end up to<br>interview them and best had this<br>nautical star map that's the only way I<br>can explain it this big star map big<br>clean and he said well I want some<br>knowledge of stars and they gave him a<br>little bit of knowledge because they<br>wanted this that meant because they had<br>all the Western names and constellations<br>on them and so he spoke to them for a<br>couple of days and best went off and he<br>wrote his book astronomical knowledge of<br>them are that's this book here to this<br>date remains the most comprehensive<br>collection of multi star war in<br>existence<br>eighty-five percent of that book comes<br>from these two individuals yet you will<br>not see their name recorded once and<br>there<br>Keysha and hit me up I Tina because when<br>he went back to see to tackle 'holy says<br>look<br>I've got all this knowledge I wanna<br>write down who gave it to me he said<br>coworker<br>coworker cobrado do not don't dear<br>because not only were they gonna call<br>Kourtney they were enough a fire<br>on my mark youtube<br>and<br>you know again any non Maori speakers in<br>here that the only wakens explained that<br>us if they were in Harry Potter that<br>and<br>my that the community was was scared of<br>these individuals and did not want their<br>names recorded and so best left them out<br>and he writes this unusual quoting you<br>know they gave him knowledge a little<br>bit of knowledge albeit and it is here<br>the available starter concerning Maori<br>star law is now exhausted and this<br>account must be closed the knowledge<br>gained by us of the subject is meager<br>and unsatisfactory but it is now too<br>late to Rimmer to remedy the deficiency<br>so one not so he's saying it's all gone<br>and the ones that are left only know a<br>little bit what he didn't know is that<br>from eighteen ninety eight to nineteen<br>thirty-one those two poor overtook this<br>map and they wrote a book<br>that manuscript is 400 pages it has a<br>thousand-mile beast our names and the<br>English equivalents because they had the<br>star map and they wrote down the names<br>it has a hundred and two constellations<br>EFE to he ordered your car hui fatihah<br>called him when it rises what it means<br>what it looks like how to read it now<br>tin or two hi nina gordon<br>their ancestor<br>the ancestor of<br>the Coco was Oklahoma<br>for courting he actually comes out of<br>the farm and me region and<br>his name was Vicky quarter and he came<br>out of that region and he came through<br>the tufa death or region and he left the<br>sindh instead and he came through the<br>money or football region and all of you<br>that know the quia rovena he left for<br>sendin stare that's her and he came<br>through Dave Murray and he left the sin<br>dance theme was quite a<br>prolific<br>person then he went to Tarawa and he<br>left descendants there and then he came<br>into two and where the younger<br>descendants and<br>this is where this knowledge base comes<br>from so it is very to hoyt<br>k mom and his deathbed of 1933 but I<br>witasick wako gave that book and the map<br>that was folded inside to his grandson<br>who was 12 he said I liked old pukka<br>pukka and the grandson was petrified of<br>his grandfather because he was a marking<br>too so he took that book and he put it<br>under his bed and it stayed there for 50<br>plus years<br>so it was collecting dust until his<br>father put them all your grandson hastam<br>one day oh you know anything about stars<br>I thought the thicker over and that was<br>me he gave me their book and so I still<br>have that book hasn't burned in a fire<br>stolen and still there but for the last<br>20 years we've been using the book as a<br>baseline because it's not you know just<br>concerned with say I mean affordable and<br>it just comes out of their book so we've<br>been researching gathering as much data<br>interviewing different people upsetting<br>some people<br>gathering as much data as we can around<br>Mardi astronomy and so that's where this<br>knowledge base comes from we also have a<br>research go proper here at modi a fitty<br>toi it's based in a faculty of Marley<br>and Indigenous Studies straight across<br>there where we've got a few research<br>projects looking at multi astronomy so<br>that's where the knowledge base that<br>we're going to talk that I'm going to<br>talk about come from<br>I'll just want to talk to you a little<br>there are many different versions Neha<br>different versions this is a real<br>martartu aversion my tribe we don't have<br>ill ok we have we start with Iranian<br>popper that's just how we are other<br>tribes have he'll take apart we are we<br>don't have ten bangi we are we don't<br>have 12 we only have 10<br>others have 12 because we have only got<br>10 fingers and let's as far as we<br>counted and we ran out<br>some tribes have 12 I'm wondering<br>whether or not you've got 12 fingers<br>that's a sign of inbreeding<br>it's a bad thing<br>anyway the two touch of gagawa is the<br>name of the pantheon of gods that's the<br>first<br>God that come from granny and papa and<br>here they are and<br>when the onion poeple we were stuck<br>together and the gods debate at the<br>separation and tarnag ripped them apart<br>okay taffie dmart there disagree he<br>absolutely disagreed with the separation<br>and<br>his brothers didn't listen they<br>separated his parents and cut away the<br>last sinews because there were still<br>vines holding them together and he got<br>out his ads and he cut them away and<br>he left them in a heap on the ground and<br>then<br>tafid he decided he would war against<br>his brothers and so he went and found<br>Carly and he beaten and he found<br>normal and he beaten and he found tunnel<br>or any beaten and then he came to our<br>God the God of War the god of mankind<br>this is a God who we take after we have<br>all the good traits that he gives us<br>jealousy lust<br>anger revenge<br>no no to utter<br>we have all of these things to send to<br>us from to and to be perfect and then<br>his frustration his love for his father<br>and his hatred of his brothers to toffee<br>sorry ripped his eyes out crush them in<br>his hands and threw them to the sky they<br>stuck to his father's chest namitha or<br>PRT Keith Duffy mafia namitha rd key my<br>buddy that's where it gets its name from<br>so<br>taffy do you mark there as you'll see in<br>that in the photo is a blind god it's a<br>reason that you never pick the way the<br>winds coming me Huck a tree always grows<br>the same way an official swim in the<br>same way but the wind the weather never<br>ever be predictable because he's a blind<br>God and he's angry blind God yeah and he<br>thrashes his way around how to a who<br>Nene now ma'am or he'll get there near<br>cooper who need me<br>anyone know the word who named me<br>and ed why he met the who Nene<br>the garden it he did he uh he taught<br>open a man gets angry like a like a firm<br>fire he gets angry he reacts dinner five<br>goes out who named nate is a fixation<br>why am I let you hand down generation up<br>the children<br>all right i'll stop because i'm going to<br>get outside<br>okay after t2 did you comea what they<br>were tumble tumble and winery tamil<br>tango is the darkness as in paul tamil<br>tabu winery is the ocean open ocean of<br>oak open waters tunnel tunnel a tunnel<br>tunnel tunnel it was very black and<br>they had a number of children<br>first was Peter<br>the Sun<br>then tamarama<br>the moon all the stars NAAFI to<br>can I thought it he now I thought it is<br>like a phosphorus lie that's also to my<br>knowledge the word that is appropriate<br>for you having an epiphany you know<br>gothic upper that quark duct at the<br>Kuppa well mudan are 80 those are my<br>party or phrases that have been<br>translated now okay why he not thought<br>it okay have you had a glimmer<br>but he koi koi is I explained us in<br>every time I explained it this way i can<br>see the people who understand fully what<br>I'm talking about patty quickly as the<br>light you use when you jump out the<br>window when you're not need to go out<br>and your eyes adjust to the darkness<br>I've a terrible day<br>ok that's pretty quickly and<br>the last one she knows a star he met a<br>lot more this is a very petite<br>she is a princess yes she's a very<br>petite hehe she's very dexterous in and<br>athletic looking female she's like<br>okay I need so these thermal couple in<br>waiting to eat the Sun the Moon the<br>Stars he not buddy-buddy Khoikhoi and he<br>need a lot more<br>so um<br>two houses children<br>tunnel tunnel built the first house ever<br>the name of this house is who eat their<br>own the order the gathering of all of<br>the lights on living things on youth and<br>he put them in his house so in who could<br>only or only knows you walk into a fuddy<br>nuit straight above the door on the<br>inside he had a son and a photo for<br>menorah meets the roof<br>in the middle of a house he had no moon<br>and then he younger stars in patterns<br>along the walls of the house this is the<br>origins of two kujaku that's why their<br>patterns the andaman shapes and patterns<br>and in the last three he put them at the<br>back of the house at the back wall ah<br>and you know there's a saying when the<br>rhenium popper was separated like<br>flooded into the world Carl when they<br>were separated the world was still duck<br>the only light was within who Tara Neil<br>entirely wanted to bring light to the<br>world so he came and saw his relation to<br>hold on and he said in what can you give<br>me your children and tumble tumble being<br>wainui was a little on the high end when<br>oh no get out<br>he said what do you want them for he<br>said I want to bring light to the world<br>it's cop I take so remember I told you<br>how time he cut the last remaining vines<br>away from nanny and papa he went back<br>and found those vines any one of three<br>baskets Wayne Emma<br>phenomenal nothing waiting in theatres<br>my did I don't know it actually started<br>with time those are the first three<br>baskets they're not the baskets of<br>knowledge okay they were male baskets so<br>they were rough and crude okay he<br>couldn't make them find he yeah I've<br>lived that one the first one its name<br>was but old you dougie and he put the<br>Sun in that one and he wove the next one<br>the Kohana and he put the moon and net<br>one and then he put the mix one up and<br>its neighbors their mama wore what they<br>kept their nuit and you put all the<br>stars and everything else in there then<br>he went and saw another relation<br>tipple not by the name of Tom identity<br>it was the owner of the first canoe now<br>we might people meant a coyote we call<br>this canoe<br>pranati key<br>here my understanding is they call it<br>grew up and this canoe with gardening<br>and in the baskets and Tom identity they<br>went out across the ocean to a place<br>where<br>you ever seen the horizon where it meets<br>the ocean it's a line for not wearing<br>mix elaine words on the ocean their<br>place of school kicked by wild it again<br>and when they go to defy way up there<br>dougie the canoe went up into the sky<br>they got into place that through the<br>anchor overboard and then they started<br>the hating the object started and he had<br>well he's actually he went to hang he<br>nero are more and he fell in love with<br>her cause she's just pretty princessy<br>sexy-looking star I guess and he married<br>her she's dexterous a really fine and<br>they had a descendant in her name is<br>hidden ethereal and so we think we even<br>comes from here the combination comes<br>from here the form comes from her father<br>the dexterous fine leaving comes from<br>the mother comes out and he'll ed we<br>then he said I'll hang the rest you have<br>30 COI coin still dark he hadn't he need<br>oh one more I'll him out what he sorry<br>still got thumbs up I'm going to hang<br>the stars I'm going to hang them like my<br>relation by mcdonald Hungnam I'm going<br>to hang them in patterns and lines and<br>so he started to hang them and so those<br>are the big stars you see in patterns<br>you can see the pot the reason it's in<br>the line and the sinner shape is because<br>apparently hundred with his hand those<br>of you they know with the southern<br>crosses again tarney put it up with his<br>head so he held up the major<br>constellations the big stars the shapes<br>then he look back down sunset food<br>data source he really said wanted to<br>celebrate what he's done so he put the<br>basket at his feet and started to do a<br>hacker we started the hukka yes I'm the<br>man I'm gonna work<br>a smiley face over here a Pokemon over<br>here he started to hug her and it has<br>hukka become more vigorously stackers he<br>nearly kicked this foot out kicked the<br>basket over the bus that toppled over<br>all of the stars scattered into the<br>cosmos and he lifted that's a reason<br>some stars are in patterns and the rest<br>of scale as recorded in a car here<br>alliances Vinnie here I teka teka teka<br>Louie your tyranny and spilling from the<br>great basket like a fish with the Stars<br>carnatic you to another and they were<br>lost into the universe<br>it was Tommy a he's a male made a fool<br>of a mess and lifted<br>if it had been a female with a head on<br>him on and get the spray and wipe<br>get the vacuum cleaned it all up and<br>started again I got the way he knew but<br>he's a male Tommy he goes then<br>ok he having a moon and then he hung the<br>Sun<br>was only when the Sun wind in the sky<br>that<br>we did the world that we know and this<br>is<br>Spielberg he knows these are the three<br>baskets<br>or some of you might know the Barbie<br>that make this here's the walkers<br>and now we couldn't afford the budget<br>that they have for avatar<br>show the stars so we had to get fairy<br>they do the trick so here he is this is<br>and he reaches into the basket and there<br>real nice<br>and that's how the stars get into the<br>sky<br>crow was looking at them thinking foam<br>so you can tell this company<br>standing with a slip hook you tell them<br>Papa theta Mike marks off at Matheny<br>and then tarney<br>hang the moon you'll see the moon in a<br>minute<br>here it is<br>we gave light but not enough finally he<br>he put up the sun and this is how we get<br>the world of light<br>so<br>i'm going to show you this photo / shave<br>mountain<br>now what you're looking at there you see<br>the Mookie way and arch like that what<br>you're looking at is when you look at<br>the blackness of the Milky Way you're<br>looking back inside the basket the<br>basket is tipped up like this and all<br>the stars are spilt out on both sides<br>okay cool then okay so that's the<br>monoblock or think of new e-ticket a<br>movie or the Milky Way never asked you<br>want to call it you<br>gotta be there now it's not getting<br>I told you they partly had a<br>Southern Cross and it it's actually an<br>anchor of the canoe<br>here are the names here's the names in<br>the Southern Cross<br>these are the different names they all<br>have a gourd it'll each of these names<br>here's the canoe it's really really<br>things me off when I go into places<br>where other people say that they were<br>called about anything this is not my own<br>but other institutions are saying is<br>along the horizon there's no evidence<br>that we've been able to find that comes<br>anywhere near close the supporting it if<br>these mountains of evidence say this<br>Taylor Scorpius is they walk off or<br>Hamid edit<br>and then and familiarity is still on the<br>canoe that's the star beer and his<br>fishing line so he's fishing in the<br>heavens is accorded about femininity he<br>fished up a overhearing here though was<br>hungry and he swallowed it whole and he<br>okay so here at the bottom you can see<br>the canoe you can see the rope that's<br>the total that woke up with some<br>identity all the way to the anger if you<br>keep you got dunya<br>okay now this is a circumpolar star so<br>it goes around a constellation the<br>Southern Cross any way around the owner<br>goes around and round all the other<br>stars they rise and they sit the star<br>goes around and around and around and<br>we're lucky because if it didn't and the<br>anger didn't stay in the sky at all<br>times like this<br>it would float away and all the stars<br>would disappear from the sky so the<br>Southern Cross will motorla is the<br>constellation that anchors all of our<br>okay<br>like I say there are different versions<br>and mine is only one version i'm going<br>to throw a few things out there for us<br>to debate and think about and you can<br>disagree you can agree they to play i'll<br>there are seven stars in mythology there<br>are seven stars in my belly okay<br>my recent within my crew was booked and<br>elsewhere has nine stars in modern aqui<br>now this whole 79 I want you to<br>understand that across the ancient world<br>there are records of 6 7 9<br>12 15<br>17 22 the Prophet Muhammad is said to<br>have been able to pick 12 with his naked<br>eye the Greeks had nine<br>okay in Hawaii there's a record of nine<br>and Easter Island there's a record of<br>nine and Malaya is a record of nine<br>other islands have six others have five<br>what I'm saying is let's not be<br>uniformed about thinking we all have to<br>think the same way yeah<br>here's a quote that<br>says I found the mild you could see more<br>stars in the Pleiades with the unaided<br>eye than I could for while I could only<br>see clearly six they could see seven in<br>sometimes eight and sometimes more<br>okay so it comes down to your ability it<br>comes down to light pollution it comes<br>down to all these different factors<br>whether or not you could see them<br>one of the things I do know it's not<br>Maui there's this idea of Seven Sisters<br>okay that is a Greek myth<br>the Greeks have nine stars and<br>they are two of them are Atlas and Kelly<br>oh who are the Earth's Atlas is the guy<br>that holds up the earth and looks like<br>me<br>and<br>he had seven daughters and<br>he tried to keep them away from Orion so<br>zootube them into a flock of doves and<br>then into stars that's why we get the<br>Seven Sisters so the Seven Sisters is<br>agreement<br>someone's told me all the other Maori<br>seven sisters car<br>unless there's been some six change<br>operations in the last rising of<br>modernity I can tell you they're not all<br>female they are not a flock of doves<br>Marley we they're not a flock of key to<br>do that someone told me okay<br>they wouldn't let that mini kitty who<br>wouldn't last where I'm fine<br>and even though that's a Greek story and<br>even though this might look like the<br>these are Greeks this is a great Gordon<br>they are not little eyes you know who<br>coined little ice<br>Alton feast come up with little eyes and<br>we have been pushing this court at all<br>since the time of beasts time of Smith<br>since the time of white beat a little<br>lies below good life<br>and all of that i'ma hoe and all of the<br>early Marley newspapers that I've gone<br>through and all of the Mort out there<br>and all of the color kia i am yet to<br>find a mile me that says little eyes<br>that's after 20 years of searching to do<br>here hawaii they are ma carte de either<br>the god somewhat they are mithani he<br>either the chief the heating either but<br>God number nui eyes are the chief we<br>mean of a bark at them only get they<br>thought okie i'll down<br>fertilized<br>hey we finally get here we have little<br>ice I<br>was going to say something that was kind<br>of urging a little bit of that was<br>inappropriate I'm an athlete that<br>there is a story from a woman called<br>Kate Clark and<br>she says it to Maori story hell mutt<br>that icky was once this great star and<br>the other stars got jealous and they<br>broke into the pieces and<br>it fell from the sky and was all these<br>little pieces and that's how it it's<br>little eyes I'm not too sure how that<br>gets a little eyes okay number one<br>number two that's not from our cable<br>that is a cook Island story that's a<br>from that is from the cook islands and<br>even there they don't say that they see<br>little eyes his name is mud that icky<br>teeny teeny which means the many little<br>modalities there's no discussion knee<br>off fertilized<br>so he opted to bottled up<br>because little eyes doesn't have a<br>corridor me honey I need to find what<br>the little eyes needs<br>my 30 key now I'm I thought they ought<br>to kick a free market<br>okay<br>these are with our place according to<br>the research micro were puts them in<br>these positions and<br>he gives the additional to or who to go<br>up and he won't get in<br>and then he goes on to explain you want<br>me to go on to talk about what each one<br>means yeah<br>go okay<br>well who do color is the star that's<br>connected to the deep this is the star<br>that carries out there across the year<br>across the sky for the year everyone<br>please their group Metallica is a sign<br>of togetherness celebration and it is a<br>particular but its first acknowledgement<br>seppuku<br>tipu means to grow our new coup in the<br>ground ok this is the star that will<br>tell you what your kumara gardens going<br>to be like or how your death adores are<br>going to grow okay this is connected to<br>everything that grows in the ground<br>support I need grow in the sky what<br>grows on this guy well birds berries<br>from the trees above you the start tells<br>you what your produce is going to be<br>like from what your birds going to be<br>like don't need those anymore<br>YT<br>but ill weighty means you've got a clear<br>voice yeah beautiful clear voice YT<br>means fresh water and it's connected to<br>everything that comes out of freshwater<br>eels freshwater fish<br>what informed<br>the word power is an old word for salt<br>the word thought bar means Swit which is<br>salty wait that is salt water and is<br>connected to the ocean of who all these<br>stories are these fury sisters and then<br>you know and they are twins and a car<br>then<br>why putting up a tiny that's wrong it<br>should be wait for nothing<br>did this water that pulls in the sky<br>this is connected to the reins and this<br>is all the Rays then fall and that's<br>going to tell you how much rain you're<br>going to get for the year<br>who do tiny doo doo de doo doo wind this<br>is kanika to the winds and tell you how<br>thus last star is called he wait didn't<br>he will means to grow lush and<br>anyway that's the only picture I could<br>come up with explaining what the latest<br>means this is a style you make a wish<br>upon now know some of you think at all<br>that sounds pretty bloody you know<br>jiminy cricket is the only thing I could<br>think to think of to explain us starting<br>at the rising of Metallica the Tohono<br>would take up people who had a wish or<br>desire in their heart and they will take<br>them out to the guard and that would dig<br>a trench and you would stand in the<br>trench and faith my 30 keynote cover<br>your feet<br>with soil because they're planting you<br>like a seat without the are there<br>planting your wishes into the earth and<br>there was Cara Kia and part of their<br>karaoke at alliance or he won't week or<br>he will or he were fuking a Cohiba 10<br>kata-kata car wheel Kevin like we are<br>both or put on a 4-yard tell mom great<br>he were wonderful he were the scene from<br>the sky plant my wishes in the ground<br>and make them come true we let the<br>chicken maldita I thought of you and so<br>you send your wishes to<br>hero up<br>these are them<br>now there's a reason why they're placed<br>where they are okay<br>Marty always hanging above look Umi how<br>can you go to the star Dogon Auckland<br>and you see thing he's way down the<br>bottom and Lukos way up the top how did<br>they take a five mile langya is always<br>above lucu they're both connected to<br>food there's male and female disbalance<br>that's why those two are there<br>white teeth and wake up both connected<br>to food one that's male witness female<br>the reason why t is above wake are as<br>fresh water always flows down as a salt<br>water salt water river flow<br>mom and Neha okay who do no need in<br>white vanilla in or above the risk<br>because that's where your weather comes<br>from when did a rain come from above<br>that's why the up there the male or<br>female this balance the reason who to<br>call when he we're getting out here I<br>have no idea the reason they're both<br>FEMA I have no idea my Corolla does not<br>record why they are there what he does<br>say is these two stars are the two<br>sacred stars in the cluster<br>these are the two puppy starts one is<br>connected with carrying uld be one is<br>connected with our deepest tax the size<br>l hope star now wishes in our once those<br>things that you only share with others<br>very very sparingly<br>we do a couple way<br>one of the things that's also left out<br>of the<br>of the corner when x is who the father<br>is okay it was the father they were is<br>an utter one of many things but one of<br>his domains is well-being this is where<br>all the one in the knowledge of reward<br>comes from from neighborhood and he<br>married mother Nikki and her sign is<br>well-being as well so that's what she<br>does she looks after the cluster and she<br>is also connected to well-being and a<br>number of Korea are said to Lee hua and<br>said to metallicy in order to make<br>someone well and<br>who to call was the oldest he waited I<br>me as the youngest and that's how the<br>rest of them come out in the up on<br>top I<br>okay<br>one of the massive misconceptions we're<br>going to talk about as we need to look<br>for Mata ki<br>because that's that's what's in here<br>okay we're going out to look for my 30s<br>not even in the sky okay we're going all<br>this celebrate much all i gotta tell you<br>so I'm not going to tell you where this<br>happen but I went out with this group<br>they said hi like we're hot on mine come<br>down and take this out and and we're<br>gonna have my delicate I think must have<br>man I think he's two weeks off goodbye<br>oh come as you please come down and you<br>do the quarter okay so I got down there<br>and<br>they had a group there in this one<br>person that a colic ear I've did a<br>corolla responsive I'm going to do the<br>coroner will matter if he comes up there<br>it is there it is this is for the<br>morning it to my daddy kiki daire to our<br>beautiful Carrara she finished here<br>Colorado they did a karakia and then how<br>much money see it all well we warm up<br>that's Venus<br>go home you're two weeks early<br>that was sorry but intervenor she goes<br>that's pathetic II did that's Venus a<br>Equis I don't want my daddy to get to<br>we're way too early and the reason that<br>we are too early is because we are not<br>following what was left to us by our<br>Maori ancestors we are following<br>interpretations of the people like best<br>we've got it into our mind that the<br>first new moon in June have you will<br>never ever ever unless you move the box<br>wanna see naughty key in the sky and the<br>first new moon of June it will not be<br>there that is a translation and we<br>are continuing to follow for you to know<br>when to look for the stars you need to<br>know the matter marker<br>our ancestors followed what's called<br>going to get a little bit technical and<br>science<br>not too much our ancestors follow what's<br>with a Looney star calendar or a lunar<br>Starr calendar so they waited for a<br>phase of the moon and waited for a star<br>to rise and they triangulate them and<br>then they work out what's happening on<br>the ground that's how they worked<br>what we're doing is we say in the first<br>new moon the new moon is feel fetal is<br>the god of death disease plague<br>pestilence all of the things ok who's<br>the num num that once it go out and look<br>for the signs of prosperity in the year<br>and the time of field<br>how did the latest column but that's not<br>how our ancestors approach that they did<br>not look for signs during the time or<br>fiddle fiddle was at that time<br>the best time to do anything is what's<br>called the last quarter or the Knights<br>of the law<br>so the first new moon in PPD is where I<br>lived as though as the no move right at<br>the top of the left hand side that's<br>when we were celebrating it the time to<br>look for it is here so you wait for the<br>best time can you wait for the best time<br>in the lunar phase<br>you understand that the Sun is a male<br>and a moon as a female a and the Sun he<br>doesn't rise in the same place every day<br>in the winter the Sun rises nor'-east<br>and that's why it's so cold in Long that<br>that night because he only acts across<br>the style but in the summer as we took<br>speck on a sexist the the Sun rises east<br>and is long we get our long warm days<br>that's why but the Sun is consistent<br>we're creatures of habit<br>easy to work out do the same things<br>pretty much the same way we're not very<br>clever at time to know give us a Linton<br>the moon is a female ok and she has as<br>often in one day<br>in my house I'm just and it bottoms out<br>for a week<br>my wife's not here so I can say<br>okay the best time when it's at its<br>height is the first or the four nights<br>of the law that's when you look for my<br>body and the celebration of Matariki<br>happens<br>over this time so it happens the little<br>or a lot a lot a name or a moment to<br>feel you up in you stop you never carry<br>your celebration into fetal I did my<br>tuna so what do you guys do I<br>come to your body<br>that's why you stopped before you get<br>into fuel this is the time<br>so this year people were out at the<br>sixth column of of June<br>looking for my 30 key okay Martha Nicky<br>wasn't visible to the 18th so Wayne way<br>later in the month and then once it<br>that's probably around the full moon<br>then these are the types of you so we<br>were way way too early i'll show you<br>in a minute<br>so this is the new moon the first new<br>moon and jus thinkin June's pippa d car<br>June's not Peabody jus there's a<br>12-month the Gorean Western calendar<br>Peabody is a Mudder Mudder that follows<br>the moon not that not a numerical system<br>so that's when we're getting mixed up as<br>we've tried to slam our motto motto into<br>a Western calendar and we getting out of<br>sync with our environment and the signs<br>of our environment number one number two<br>so if I got no hope see is the time to<br>look for my 30 key is in panel or micro<br>arenas manuscripts is the time to look<br>for Metallica isn't Honora we removed<br>our fight<br>far no Appa nuit Donna Mara matticus is<br>the time to look for Metallica estan<br>Aurora a pee raha metonymy tohunga<br>profit from the fire more then there's<br>Marty newspaper writing says the time to<br>look for my 30 key as in pomeroy why are<br>we looking in the new moon<br>because we're following enough water<br>like the parka Aditya I mean uh<br>Palo Alto cheaper<br>ok<br>here is the walk alone again that's its<br>generic name here they'll know this as<br>they were 14 me an ape<br>I'll show you this one<br>this is what it is these are all these<br>different parts of this Walker this<br>Walker is<br>a giant<br>dick badge<br>ok<br>there is a God at all that when<br>metallicy rises it is at the front of<br>this massive knuth because canoe belongs<br>to that man they're called ton of a no<br>but a mainly who has a net<br>when this constellation rises in the<br>morning on the eastern horizon he leads<br>us knit across you and he trolls you for<br>all the people that had died during that<br>day and before the rock before the<br>rising of the Sun he holds him up onto<br>his canoe and he hangs out there from<br>their place called the hull or do it and<br>they hang from the back of the canoe<br>like the feathers and the hanging and he<br>does this<br>night after night month after month from<br>the month of PPD all the way to may two<br>holla to<br>win this canoe sits in the sky next to<br>the Sun muttering he sits next to the<br>Sun it is missing for a month and now my<br>dear go to be prepared at the underworld<br>when they come back<br>like this in PPD that am I knew who gets<br>on canoe he grabs the kuda kuda from the<br>back of the canoe and he sketches them<br>into the stars this is the moment that<br>your spirit becomes a star in the sky<br>you wait for a twelvemonth<br>we're not told month before the rising<br>of month any key before our dead and we<br>release our did this is the moment i'm<br>going to show you my daddy key sitting<br>this is called Martha he could it be you<br>wait this is from Huntley so you can see<br>the moons in the total war face this is<br>the west of the sky<br>ok so this is it something so the sun's<br>coming down<br>yeah<br>these mother Nikki these are canoe it's<br>tipped up there is the Sun<br>diving into the West taking our deep<br>with it for the year now you won't see<br>pathetic equals a substitute pride but<br>you can tell by the position of Tok guru<br>and the lunar phase and the right month<br>that our dead of God for the year and we<br>for a period called the Martha Hill<br>teeth though<br>tell the Royal phase of the moon this<br>was this year<br>we wait for them to come up<br>and they rise just before the sudden<br>there's my daddy key<br>there's a canoe up comes the sun<br>bring you out there and thought I mind a<br>coup scatters them across the sky I'm<br>going to go back to show you that canoe<br>again<br>that's what our people know we're<br>looking at we're now looking for the<br>rising of Montana key there are three<br>major things<br>that happened dream Medici<br>3-meter to color I pretty much gonna<br>end on a soon before i go into my rant<br>about why i'm saying hands off my stars<br>okay<br>the first thing that they would do is<br>they wait for mother Nikki to rise in<br>the right lunar phase at the right month<br>and they know what take their reading<br>for the year they would go outside and<br>the poor my poor poor tangy would look<br>at my parakeet hmm<br>it's going to be a good year to plant<br>your vegetables this year it's going to<br>be a bad year fish in the ocean the<br>screw to dougie it's really hard to see<br>which means it's going to be a lot of<br>wind we're going to have problems<br>getting out on the ocean but whitey is<br>really really bright so we know we're<br>going to catch lots of use<br>tiburon look who is really bright we<br>know we're going to get on a lot of<br>vegetables but tip wearing is kind of<br>hazing which means we're not going to<br>catch birds easy not going to sit in the<br>pitch in okay FC is going to struggle<br>this year<br>so you read them in combinations yeah<br>you read them in combinations if he<br>waked at AE is bright you know I'm going<br>to send my wishes here this year lotto<br>numbers okay if wake unagi is bright you<br>know that that's not going to be there<br>might rain but if it's hard to see<br>we're going to have a lot of rain if<br>/ who do color is bright<br>then not many people are going to die<br>that you if it's hard to see and missing<br>from the sky how far kidding away to<br>hook you up with we don't know call it<br>all they usually talk about that one but<br>yeah we don't not thought<br>once they had done that and read the<br>science the next thing they would do<br>what's called a walked out there<br>they would weep and call out the names<br>of the people who have died since the<br>last rising in my body so you would<br>mourn for them you call out their names<br>and release them part of my look<br>restoring limits into space to become a<br>star and so you would call out their<br>names this year we called our Prince<br>Purple Rain<br>okay so they would call out their names<br>of the people who had died and you<br>release them from you because you carry<br>them yeah you always carry your mother<br>but our tip owner would carry them for<br>that period film athletic eros this is<br>why now we might do something like wait<br>for 12 months before we unveil or<br>someone okay it actually originated for<br>waiting for the rising and mythology you<br>release the dead from yourself<br>in the final thing they would do is they<br>would cook a kite it's called a unfair<br>to of steamy star oven and when Martha<br>Nikki had been warned over and the deer<br>had been passed their stars they will<br>take the top off the oven and all a<br>steel would rise up and feed<br>methodically because he's tired<br>the name of the food that you put in<br>this earth oven to feed her utter was<br>called a hookup<br>and that is recorded a net Hucker got<br>their hope popped weary thicky thick I<br>nah my diary the sacred food that has<br>been prepared to feed my buddy ki-duk<br>burn a<br>severing the bonds to your bed<br>er haha in what happens God to their he<br>got to their one not one and then the<br>Sun comes up finishing the ceremony<br>that is what that means<br>well they're glad Ellie told me that so<br>I'm not going to doubt him<br>okay<br>now i'm going to have my moment cut out<br>my while you so yeah here are the dates<br>for the setting of my 30 gig for the<br>rising of my 30 year and for the<br>celebration period based on the lunar<br>phases<br>I've got them for 50 years but you got<br>to buy my book<br>what I'm really stewing about<br>at the moment is who's telling our<br>stories<br>okay this went up and stuff according to<br>stuff during the sex<br>this is a non practitioner not going to<br>non-pressure it has no understanding of<br>real when Teague no it's not mildly<br>telling us all there is not a tiki this<br>it's called mother Dickey everything<br>there is to know about it okay not that<br>icky tiny ice<br>that a deal<br>it's the name for the group of stars<br>also not display DS or the Seven Sisters<br>130 key is the name for the traditional<br>Maori New Year know that it is the name<br>of the customer in my phone is a<br>this is marked by the rise of Madonna<br>key and the sighting<br>sighting in the next remove moon carved<br>you won't see it in the next new moon<br>it's got here what did I keep observant<br>hopefully this works<br>honey<br>i'm going to show you<br>there is Mata ki over here<br>I'm going to take the landscape away<br>I'm going to put this grid on in<br>order for my 30 key to your fee see this<br>is a horizon hell I'm going to go<br>and I can't with it there's the new moon<br>mar 30 key is here there needs to be<br>21 degrees of separation between the<br>star the Sun has to be at least 15<br>degrees below the horizon while<br>Metallica is 5 degrees above the horizon<br>for you to see it ok that's how you know<br>otherwise the Sun comes up and it washes<br>out the sky and these stars disappear so<br>in order to see my daddy key it's got to<br>be above the horizon at a particular<br>height while the sun is still below the<br>horizon at a particular height depth<br>sorry on the sixth that wasn't happening<br>sorry I can't adjust the workout I want<br>I<br>suppose<br>what I was haul her about was the fact<br>that<br>when this came out<br>when this came out and stuff when these<br>books came out watch aren't written by<br>Maori no one's seen anything<br>god I thought though he called him no<br>one said a thing I came out that she sa<br>well maybe we might have more than seven<br>starts maybe we're too early maybe they<br>have a different ticker mother's<br>attention to the deer maybe we need to<br>start debating whether or not we're<br>following our traditional tickler maybe<br>we should return to practicing though<br>mukha who come for 20 next minute<br>everyone's telling me yeah stop making<br>up stuff d 7 we have no yield yo yo I<br>didn't go away<br>and I was thinking about that when i<br>read that and stuff I read and waited<br>for someone to comment on it how did<br>there that he quarter we put<br>that he did me out not the park out<br>their day to<br>be not that botty pinner you know we are<br>looking at people there don't practice<br>have no connection to language or<br>culture are telling us who we are a<br>Maori doesn't oh my god<br>hey oh wait Li Oh hair flip<br>don't wait for ya<br>don't bring your two boy stuff<br>no papa dr. Tia Mowry car one each otha<br>know who we're not didn't like you I<br>thought though my mom's just putting it<br>out there you know if it comes with my<br>back I will say nothing comes from my<br>way

it<br>about your sidekick up like a key play<br>was a hand at home<br>oh yeah not I think if no one's talking<br>about you then you're not doing a very<br>good job hey nice talking about CJ's<br>just
