when the god of to where Germany<br>have died in 1987 Carmelita Donatella<br>you heard it at the month<br>68 years old Carmelita Tanaka he died<br>before his time he was just coming into<br>his own he had made<br>huge grounds not only in - hey but in<br>bar Eden he was the kind of person that<br>we looked up to he was el hijo blue<br>Manabe he was the role model for<br>children<br>he was a person that we were in or of a<br>man who we considered God helped you a<br>little Anthony he brought confidence to<br>to her whenever he was seen on to him<br>alright and now that he was gone there<br>was this<br>appalled II Davey it was this feeling of<br>overwhelming despair that we felt<br>because the roost upon which the birds<br>had now fallen and there was no roost no<br>more shelter for to weigh<br>and when he died not very long after<br>the rest of his generation began to die<br>off in LA and at an alarming rate it was<br>amazing to us the generation down from<br>that generation to see the devastation<br>that death was causing to our people and<br>we<br>asked of ourselves we asked the question<br>well<br>who is going to lead us now who will the<br>leaders be<br>who of the living living would step up<br>and fill the void left by the passing of<br>that generation of celebrated scholars<br>and leaders these were the Linnet being<br>of Tuhoe men of integrity<br>mean of mana and although they had<br>groomed us<br>for the time when they were to to leave<br>to leave us we were still unprepared for<br>and they were a few of us who tried to<br>take control then to step up but<br>they lacked the charisma and the<br>leadership skills of those<br>celebrated scholars<br>so in a short time you looked annoyed<br>there was devastation on to her Mariah<br>and a whole generation of pie-pie<br>speakers was gone and that's where you<br>notice the difference all these beakers<br>had gone all the lunar the people who<br>were able to put together words were now<br>gone<br>and you have to remember that in to her<br>at that time<br>they were still a<br>majority of to weigh who actually spoke<br>to Maori language who could actually and<br>spoke it well but speaking the Maori<br>language<br>and speaking the level language of every<br>day and transferring that knowledge<br>to speaking on the pipe I are two<br>different worlds<br>they're ill or cover with Adele or puppy<br>the the language of everyday without the<br>nail or copy the language of the<br>pipeline is a language<br>that is not spoken every day that is<br>so<br>this generation of speeches were gone<br>and we'll we will lift devastated on the<br>armodafinil<br>and they are not even one now at that<br>time<br>and there's academics with the<br>collective experience of many years<br>Tibor takara to friday Huia Milroy and<br>myself<br>decided that we had to revive<br>the to have one and a Kroger that Ronnie<br>who had been responsible for<br>and which he initiated from<br>1963 to his death in 1987 not at all<br>eternity matera arowana and he was well<br>before his time will he decided that<br>that was what he was going to do he<br>noticed that<br>the generation above him were about to<br>to face demise and then he decided that<br>he was going to interview them and while<br>they were alive he was going to carry<br>when the time came for their passing to<br>wear would be imbued with the knowledge<br>of two ways with our faculty<br>of the telephony the takuan a so we were<br>part of his group we were part part of<br>his<br>cohort of students in fact he liked us<br>because we could write and<br>we could write things we could be his<br>script writers and record the one on up<br>the two he Nirvana are two who eat OVA<br>and those were healthy in days then<br>heiwa era it to another woman and they<br>it did not work yet they were a far far<br>not to not the one I like to talk my day<br>in 1963 get out in multi retire and we<br>learnt a lot<br>we learned a lot and one of the things<br>about learning you see is when you write<br>things down<br>to remember those things because you<br>wrote it down although you were just a<br>scriptwriter but you tended to remember<br>things that you wrote down and so we had<br>an advantage<br>over those of two who could not write<br>like a professor only Marlowe anyway we<br>we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we<br>were so glad to be part of his<br>students<br>the program that Tony had<br>undertook helped her cope up a fight<br>Ito abara when he undertook the the<br>program that time and Lea in the 1960s<br>1970s they were we were facing the the<br>end of the move the shift from the rural<br>rural areas into the suburban areas into<br>the cities there was a huge move and<br>once you move from your base Garnica<br>claimed like though he be king our town<br>it what tends to happen is that<br>everything that had to do with your EB<br>you tended to leave behind<br>and you tended to create a new life for<br>yourself and a new culture for yourself<br>in the cities that's exactly what<br>happened to two hoods<br>but there was also the<br>the view at that time and and the fact<br>at that time that many EB were beginning<br>to lose their language<br>language was becoming a problem for many<br>EB and to hear was considered with that<br>at that time to be the barometer by<br>which we could measure whether their<br>language was still alive or whether it<br>was on the on the way<br>towards demise<br>now you could meet you how you were<br>doing if - it was in a good state then<br>you could<br>safely say that the risk of martyrdom<br>wasn't in a good state if - it was in a<br>bad state then you could safely surmise<br>that the rest of Merredin with the in a<br>bad state it's not like that anymore but<br>that's how real and the the health of<br>their was majored in the 6th in the<br>1670s and moving into the 80s<br>so<br>here we were in<br>1987 takatori Montalvo but the funny who<br>you were Timothy granny - we put our<br>collective heads together and decided<br>that we were going to do something about<br>about this about perpetuating and<br>carrying on the good work of telling me<br>how we were going to continue with the<br>1aa of Tuhoe and we did<br>but because - who I was in a good state<br>as far as language was concerned the new<br>Ino - who according to Mariana we<br>decided that we would concentrate on on<br>chikkanna we would concentrate on those<br>things that had been affected by the<br>passing of that generation of speakers<br>and that was fight corridor and karana<br>and second we decided that that was the<br>area to concentrate on and because of<br>the three of us kimochi was the doyen of<br>the Maori language he decided that we<br>would carry the<br>the flag while he stood to the side and<br>so in the early 1990s the three of us<br>revived the one on approval to wear and<br>as I said that was lifted to 240 Huia<br>and me to do<br>the one and over he'll then in yato or<br>to hue and also in the pockets where<br>to who I lived in in the differences so<br>we moved to Auckland<br>why capital<br>Rotorua<br>Wellington the East Hawke's Bay<br>promised the north and even the South<br>Island and that was the extent of the<br>the one honor that we held to perpetuate<br>the<br>the the knowledge that Ronnie how had so<br>by the early years of this century to<br>Hue were equipped to hold their own Haku<br>or district Winona enabled it to<br>discharge<br>their pi pi obligations and that's how<br>it is today go to your mother they<br>defecate Auto Tech oh yeah - who a<br>Catahoula data get a detail Kuya Ottawa<br>no I'm a coroner armata yeah - whoo Nani<br>Hakuna Matata Yahoo king of Apache<br>purana Italy who and now the different<br>pockets of - who a definite difference<br>districts or - who hold their different<br>one now<br>what would a hymn a hymn our motto<br>we had nothing to do in the meantime<br>while this was happening<br>Timothy Carlton who didn't have anything<br>to do was busy talking with that one and<br>I walk a walk Tarawa about a program and<br>the program that he had in mind<br>was<br>getting together<br>roots of<br>of students and<br>taking them from their level of<br>understanding and knowledge of their the<br>the real Maori and moving them<br>many<br>spits up to a level where they they<br>could become the leaders<br>and the keepers of cultural obligations<br>how did the Punic idiot on I begin and<br>that's how it began the team ot<br>initiated the the an interview with raw<br>rubber within it and Noble thought that<br>the Coco per the request was good and so<br>he'll dared us to to begin the program<br>and the program was given the green<br>light in ninety in 2004 and the<br>greenie Matta<br>this city old goat over here<br>on the on the right that's for any and<br>all right<br>the other all goat in the middle that<br>team article it to and of course and I'm<br>so what is the significance of the vein<br>what is the panikhida turn away that<br>panicky return I get its name well the<br>named Tiffany ciudadano was suggested by<br>one of the inaugural students now dr.<br>talita Capisce of wake up Oh Nancy pro<br>now panicky latina is a prominent<br>feature of nature on white column one<br>it talks about the hid the funny and<br>the kitty the crown of the head so it<br>doesn't take too much imagination to<br>read<br>philosophy of high endeavour of reaching<br>for the st multi-port<br>apotheosis of rail and chicken around at<br>the high level<br>standards of real and Chicana around the<br>panikhida turner and then you have the<br>institute of the maori of excellence in<br>the Maori language the panic in eternal<br>video and that's how that that name<br>began and it's quote on in many<br>students of the of the Maori language<br>and they are using that term definitely<br>Donna to suggest reaching<br>what are the aims of the teppanyaki<br>didn't well<br>the aims of the panic idiot on earth for<br>teriyaki a chicken teriyaki ready but<br>they do look your mouth and we can't<br>claim that this rocket okey this axiom<br>is the prerogative of the pony Keerthana<br>only it's also<br>entrenched in the Kohanga REO and<br>intention another Maori<br>language learning programs but that is<br>what we live by and when we analyze<br>what that means today okay chica contain<br>a oke RNA I think those<br>two phrases are are clear enough but<br>they do young Maori needs a wee bit of<br>explanation<br>for the panekiretanga it's not enough<br>that you take and on Maori idea and<br>translated it must be a Maori idea in<br>the first place so we don't look<br>are prevalent at this point of time<br>constructions like at the end of the day<br>if the Peto Tara we think that is not<br>Maori it's only a translation of a party<br>her idea it DiMucci matter what there<br>are at the finish of the of the day<br>so we think that the<br>we assert that the idea must be Maori in<br>origin may Maori - forgot mafic our<br>mouth go well for Cara Parker got the<br>hiccup acha acha parka her in Ocarina<br>parka if a carpark hockey theta it<br>doesn't add growth and development to<br>the language a marina cuidado Chicano<br>there's a Christian<br>about<br>nothing I bet help that's one get into<br>the Academy well with difficulty it's<br>not a an Academy that's open to everyone<br>and<br>I<br>might get<br>professor Mottola to talk about how you<br>this idea that elitism isn't allowed we<br>think elitism is not<br>everyone not everyone did the guidance<br>not everyone's ensuing job soon people<br>due to the improper and their abilities<br>were selected to be told various things<br>that's how the heights of knowledge was<br>maintained it wasn't dumbed down it<br>wasn't<br>lift it up and maintained it over to<br>kill me and you were hand-picked and<br>hastily and that's the philosophy behind<br>this project I'm not too sure why the<br>shoes are at the end the our gear is is<br>to get into the public in Adana you need<br>to be silly you need to be acknowledged<br>as a speaker<br>and someone that has the ability to<br>make the great ideas and then you come<br>to the institution and it's very much<br>like a traditional play wanna throw away<br>the bouquet Debbie I put that way to go<br>baby if I wanna I thought I did that<br>they<br>yeah the picture of the shoes if you<br>study here the picture of those shoes<br>you find that that they are high-quality<br>shoes there's no cheap pair of shoes in<br>there these are Italian shoes<br>they are Italian shoes and there's about<br>yeah 30 pairs of Italian shoes in there<br>what that suggests is that when you come<br>here at the Pawnee ciudadano you are<br>expected to be your own person in other<br>words you must contribute to the<br>development of the rail contributed in<br>the development of new knowledge<br>it's it's not good enough in our view we<br>assert that's not good enough for you to<br>step into the shoes of someone else buy<br>new shoes<br>buy new shoes and that's the that's what<br>that is trying to to seduce so it's<br>difficult to get in today it's not easy<br>to get into the<br>into the panic unit and I hated it King<br>Arthur II wanna know you just don't walk<br>into a 40-mile enough<br>yeah you have to make application to get<br>in we get into fun Ivana and it's a lot<br>more difficult to get into a panic idiot<br>on earth first you must have a standard<br>of real in order for a student to enter<br>to connect in aterna they must be<br>recommended they must be a<br>recommendation of Anika Alfio or of<br>someone who has already done the course<br>and it is<br>their responsibility<br>when<br>the student fails because they have<br>recommended someone who was not fit to<br>be in the intermediate Ana so they<br>entry standards are very high but it's<br>not to say that<br>there is not a lot of people flocking<br>for to Tapani Keerthana<br>for this intake there were a hundred and<br>seventy four applications to move into<br>yeah 35 of the 874 and all of the 174<br>work quality<br>applications but we stuck to the<br>standards and the assertion that they<br>had to be recommended by past students<br>what impact has to panic a death on a<br>cocooning automatic<br>naka de agua negra corridor midi data<br>committee young harmonica not a recorder<br>-<br>yet I cuckoo a faculty on a rata kama<br>sutra pitaka<br>no retreat apology eternal did you know<br>reader<br>appendix Africa<br>if you create a standard of language<br>and you can you pitch it at a high level<br>sooner or later if it's worth something<br>to the listener to the student they<br>adopted<br>so the impact that the panikhida Tana<br>has had its head impact in<br>nomina quarter and we know that because<br>we are<br>judges of nominee Carrillo and the<br>students of the panikhida Tana judges of<br>not Manu korero these people who are<br>sitting here and<br>we look at one another knowingly and<br>think years we know where that comes<br>from or that's a development and we have<br>no problems with that that's why we do<br>these things so that it has an impact<br>so it's being used by the schools and<br>that's where we know that we are doing<br>the right thing when schools begin to<br>use it when Kura Kaupapa Maori begin to<br>use that kind of language words like et<br>pocket that we think oh<br>that's that's really good and then we<br>move into the area of the media and one<br>of the best<br>Basinger that we have of the funny<br>Keerthana this Ngati Tama Nahal Morrison<br>as soon as he cut me as soon as he came<br>out of learning after Pollock in Astana<br>on the Monday he was using the words<br>that event from the panna cotta that we<br>came and<br>there are other broadcasters and media<br>people who are<br>using this strange language oh and then<br>of course there's the matatini<br>yeah they used to be a time that<br>if a composition was written by team ot<br>myself or Tafari Huia for the matatini<br>for a group in the matatini the death<br>composition would win<br>that composition would win well not<br>anymore<br>it doesn't happen that way anymore in<br>fact our students are now making a huge<br>impact in the composition for the<br>matatini and<br>what we have found in our research is<br>that if you don't<br>move into that area as we call<br>and we turn that area to panic in<br>you tend not to be successful in thermal<br>30 that's what we are finding that's<br>what the research is showing so it's had<br>that kind of impact<br>have we had<br>the titles have we had<br>critics of course we have and that's<br>what make makes what we do very exciting<br>because if we didn't have critics if you<br>didn't have critics then your co Papa<br>must be mediocre but if you had critics<br>who were talking about that then saying<br>ah you know that that punny can hit on<br>our language or character character<br>ticka if you hate that kind of if you<br>didn't have that kind of language you<br>weren't doing that well I know reader to<br> here now at the top American and<br>muy quite the corridor theater company a<br>we a wa8 AoE at the wall Henry<br>they we hate the cordon with the coke<br>opening

you know yeah yeah<br>yeah oh you you at the right place come<br>in<br>anyway they went in and it was a gang<br>it was a game pair and these fellas went<br>in Oh deal the part of the story they<br>decided on before they they they they<br>ever took that they decided to ring<br>coral head a knocko more either I do<br>need another mahi bit and go ahead it<br>then we're gonna talk weird but Oakland<br>are bloody coming anything coming up to<br>anything longer think I'm ready if he<br>was stupid alright okay yeah anyway<br>these guys will only two of them and<br>they get into this gang pit and they<br>relieved by this babe<br>they went into the the bottom<br>the bottom<br>floor of this three-story building and<br>they saw a hundred Harley's<br>new Harley's and all the the limousines<br>and they were walking through they took<br>him into they took him upstairs into the<br>second second floor and<br>they was the gym and there was the bar<br>huge thing flash<br>and the office block and then they took<br>him to the top four and it was where the<br>the pin tells of the the game boss and<br>they were taken lead to this room and<br>they entered the room and they saw two<br>Maori Nate in one I hit them all<br>be named he was he was<br>yeah he might have been in his late<br>fifties early sixties and he was sitting<br>there and these guys recognized at the<br>poor Donita Donata great they're pouring<br>into another he was dribbling he was<br>yeah he was obviously in a bad way<br>anyway these guys you know they were<br>taken aback by this by this but by what<br>they confronted anybody they started<br>they started to think well we better do<br>our job and then they asked Christians<br>what what's happened to him and so it<br>turned out that<br>there was a prospect of working for the<br>black power down here in Hamilton and he<br>liked working for the black power and he<br>decided to go for Vista to Oakland saw<br>the hair anything more the gang no<br>hit hunters this is the hit hunters like<br>what he saw and decided to jump ship<br>meantime the boss of the black cow here<br>in Hamilton heard about it and ran up<br>the gang boss of the headhunters and<br>told him well that's not wrong that's<br>not protocol and they started to have<br>they had a big fight and in the end<br>words were exchanged and the one down<br>here put a mark or two on the one out<br>there and that's hell that tell these<br>for the survival of the problem was so<br>market so these guys said five o'clock<br>woman we're gonna be back here at five<br>o'clock this is what we want we want a<br>fire going we won six kumara in the fire<br>and the philosophy helping a fire are<br>just a little fire how many bags of<br>cumin or no we just once six kumara and<br>that's what we want and we want access<br>anyway they came back at five o'clock<br>and there was this fire in a short time<br>these fellows had built this contraption<br>with receptacles in it and there was<br>kumara there were a hundred gang members<br>there and these fellows went up and<br>damaja they carried out the<br>the WA and the all they did<br>that they walked up there those two this<br>follow katenka rakia he ran and<br>they got there a sprig of with leaves on<br>it and just brushed her on the eyes of<br>the of the person that was affected of<br>the gang boss and he came to he came to<br>and he looked around said what the<br>bloody hell's going on here and they<br>told him what happened and what had<br>happened to him and what the process was<br>well they were so amazed by<br>the work of these two gentlemen<br>that they were able to do that<br>and there's a war they all will<br>match down to where the fire was and the<br>old partook of the kumara that they had<br>cooked a war theater and when<br>that was over there was a<br>an announcement by by one of the members<br>that Chi was ready they went upstairs<br>to the second floor to<br>to the dining room and<br>the the Chi that was the spread that<br>they had on the tables were<br>beyond what they recognized of course<br>they had to Hani but they had K like<br>caviar and all that kind of kind we need<br>the money out there yeah anyway these<br>guys sat down and they they enjoyed<br>their Chi and next minute there was a<br>bang on the on the on the table katenka<br>haram i the turn attorney

decided are you mister just<br>shut up and there was another bang on<br>the end there the gang boss who was now<br>good he came up with it put his hand out<br>and they put an envelope in the same and<br>they gave it to him they opened it up<br>and it contained well these fellows at<br>the end of it they said their farewells<br>jumped in the car and took off ten<br>kilometers down the road they

from what we were doing taking<br>this cohort of<br>donut and<br>presently I felt that we had to address<br>that and so<br>when they graduated some two years ago I<br>decided wouldn't it be a good idea if I<br>were to<br>initiate another cohort of women to<br>women and I talked about it widely I<br>talked about here with my colleagues at<br>the University to see what the reaction<br>would be and it was favorable and then I<br>thought it would be a really neat idea<br>if I could get<br>my<br>graduates from the multiple to<br>help me teach that so I called a meeting<br>of that this law<br>called a meeting of the diversity or not<br>he's a proposition and the funny thing<br>is the interesting thing is for me as an<br>academic at at the University<br>many of them the majority of them were<br>reticent<br>thank one favor let's think about this<br>and I thought that was really<br>interesting where I wanted to go they<br>were reticent and in fact they had been<br>taught to be wide ranging and thinking<br>to have open minds and here they were<br>that's one of them over there<br>but<br>that's still in pain<br>and that particular cohort would be will<br>their mother Bowie who yeah you have<br>them up their mother pruning on top and<br>the multiple oil would be a cohort of<br>women Puma that we would get together<br>but I have to convince the mother Felina<br>that they
