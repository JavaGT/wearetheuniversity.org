accurate.</p><p>okay good afternoon everybody from the<br>loud to the very quiet<br>chamber music yes<br>pleasure to be talking to you today I'm<br>going to just start with a little<br>introduction to myself and how I got<br>into this topic basically I've been<br>gradually working my way there through<br>the late 18th century into the early<br>19th century it may seem like a rather<br>short journey to you from Hyden which<br>was my topic of my PhD thesis through to<br>a book on Beethoven's middle period<br>string quartets dealing with a canonic<br>composer in canonic john rus' and in the<br>first part of that book I had an<br>introductory chapter in that chapter<br>basically became the subject of the<br>present research which is looking at<br>everything else other than Beethoven but<br>during his same time period and in his<br>same location Vienna which was a hotbed<br>of musical production and publishing and<br>performance in the late 18th and early<br>19th century it's an incredibly exciting<br>time in music history because for the<br>first time music started to be more<br>publicly performed it was publicly<br>performed in the church and in court<br>settings where semi publicly performed<br>where quite large gatherings could have<br>obviously a mess but for the first time<br>concert life starts and music gets<br>spread on a wider screen if you like now<br>during this time in Vienna there were a<br>variety of other composers working busy<br>working away but today we know virtually<br>nothing about them and that was to my<br>mind a great pity why do we know<br>virtually nothing about them well it has<br>to do obviously with the quality of<br>their work and with the aesthetics of<br>the time but when I went back and<br>started editing some of this music I<br>found that that wasn't necessarily the<br>most important factor that was<br>presenting preventing their music from<br>being known today one of the factors was<br>that it wasn't so wide that wasn't so<br>common in those days to publish because<br>publication of music in Vienna was quite<br>slow to get going as opposed to the<br>Protestant north<br>and so it's a time when chamber music<br>becomes the first music to be most<br>widely and published and distributed but<br>certain composers haven't cottoned onto<br>that idea and so some of this music<br>remained unpublished even though it was<br>very good<br>so I started to edit some of this music<br>myself and realized that it was a great<br>pity that it wasn't more widely known<br>today the other reason why this music<br>isn't so well known this is a letter by<br>Beethoven by the way and as you can see<br>even if you're German even if you have<br>some background in reading this kind of<br>handwriting you will still find it<br>difficult I've been with some colleagues<br>at the Beethoven house still trying to<br>figure out some of the words on this<br>page a rather famous Testament by<br>Beethoven and so we get handwritten<br>documents we have Diaries we have<br>so-called ephemera that are our main<br>lines of evidence for what went on in<br>private sphere music making during the<br>time so it's sometimes quite difficult<br>to get at the evidence it sometimes<br>involves a bit of sleuthing and<br>detective work and some of the evidence<br>is rather hard to uncover and even once<br>you have quite difficult to decipher on<br>the other hand there are a wide variety<br>of different lines of evidence that we<br>can use to uncover what happened in the<br>private sphere and one of my favorite is<br>to look at iconography I just talk very<br>briefly about this picture by way of a<br>case study of how I operate when I'm<br>looking at chamber music in Beethoven's<br>Vienna and trying not focus on Beethoven<br>this particular picture has to do with<br>Schubert he's actually labeled here's<br>that little guy with the mushroom head<br>and the little spectacles sort of curly<br>hair so he's labeled there's a variety<br>of pictures that one looks at for<br>evidence about the string quartet and<br>other chamber music making at the time<br>and typically I find that a lot of the<br>emphasis in these pictures is in fact on<br>the listeners as you can see here some<br>of them are actually labeled with their<br>names and not the performer we also<br>noticed a variety of visual tropes<br>trotting through these pictures very<br>often there are busts and other<br>artifacts that suggest high art in<br>connection with the string quartet in<br>particular so those tropes<br>to establish the privileged nature of<br>chamber music making and as I said a<br>focus on the listeners often they're<br>deeply they're even either got their<br>eyes closed or as in the case we don't<br>really know about this man on on your<br>left whether he's asleep<br>whether he's studying a score on his<br>people have suggested different things<br>that maybe he's studying a score on his<br>lap or maybe that's the fold of his<br>trouser but there always seems to be<br>some sort of an emphasis on the listener<br>and on the act of listening so that's<br>one of my Avenue zuv research part of<br>what's new about this research is that I<br>do focus on audience reception quite a<br>lot and on performance I'm not so<br>concerned with looking at the notes<br>partly because it's quite difficult to<br>get those notes in the first place I<br>have to do lots of editing and<br>fossicking around and transcribing but<br>gradually I am building up a repertoire<br>of this music but I'm trying to carve<br>out a broadly cultural approach to the<br>music and that involves looking at<br>various other different kinds of<br>evidence than the notes on the page so<br>for example I have a section on<br>publishing he's oh come back to that one<br>a minute that's good we could talk about<br>that these are the chapters of my book<br>this one here so defining chamber music<br>in the nineteenth century<br>celebrating Hyden who was actually as<br>opposed to Beethoven one of the main<br>cultural gods in Vienna in the early<br>19th century baton was still getting his<br>name made for him and partly himself<br>making his name but he was not so well<br>known and by those who did write about<br>him and well they thought that he was<br>quite an avant-garde composer so we're<br>looking at venues between chamber and<br>theater the new venues that were carved<br>out for this music chamber music in the<br>biedermeyer site so how it factors into<br>the coffee and culture of the salon<br>coffee sort of table culture I'm<br>interested in criticism and how social<br>ideals were written into that criticism<br>and then I'm interested into what in<br>what happened next what happened after<br>Beethoven disappeared from the scene and<br>the impact that his music had in part<br>then covering up all of that other music<br>that's then become lost to today
