about the center how it was formed<br>how it survived and how you can attract<br>other people maybe even without going to<br>a cocktail or creating other interest<br>that was very interesting again you<br>mentioned and most of the time you<br>really interact with people over lunch<br>or something and you find the common<br>interest topics okay in any case our<br>whole idea of the center when we four<br>formed was to have typical of course<br>qualified workforce innovative products<br>and improved tooling I am NOT asking you<br>to read all those there will be very<br>many<br>these input things in the research area<br>in the students everything will have to<br>be combined so I will really try to say<br>that how we are now currently and and<br>this new market campus we are trying to<br>interact with like ours is the<br>composites Research Center and then you<br>have got it's not working and and the<br>robotics Research Center manufacturing<br>all the other groups in fact um unless<br>we work with each other it is almost<br>impossible to progress any further now<br>this diagram is complicated originally<br>created for an MBI review to confuse<br>them but<br>but since then I have used it it has<br>been actually even international talks<br>this they have said that it gives us an<br>idea if you look at the right from the<br>left and New Zealand industry then we<br>have got overseas industry sponsors<br>right quite interesting is right from<br>BMW to Disney in fact it will be very<br>surprising they are working with us on<br>their new<br>a new version of Pirates of the<br>Caribbean Mad Hatter's party all those<br>things how to change the material and<br>how to make them more on this<br>manufacturing easy and DuPont Boeing we<br>are directly working with arm<br>association of rotational molders so<br>there are and also crc acs it is the<br>Cooperative Research Center in Australia<br>in fact we managed to get more than a<br>million dollars from them to do some<br>research so of course the funding agency<br>MB ie and its various generations of<br>this MBI and variations at ICI we did<br>get interact with that and quite a bit<br>of funding German Science Foundation you<br>Office of Naval Research we have been<br>working with them for seven years eight<br>years now the fourth project has been<br>approved and also BK 21 plus that is the<br>brain Korea 21 and Korean Science<br>Foundation and recently we have<br>participated in air-sea discovery and<br>linkage and there is real money not that<br>simply participation I am NOT interested<br>really anymore in that that and also New<br>Zealand collaborators University of<br>Waikato aut Sion IRL of Kalani<br>innovation DTA and I another thing is we<br>have started collaborating with this<br>faculty of medical and health science<br>it's an ABI it is very very important<br>because our areas as I said from<br>aerospace to<br>coronary stent so if we give that<br>background and I'm not asking you to<br>read all those these words there but the<br>research area will be novel materials<br>that's what we try to develop right from<br>this self feeling material here drunk I<br>just mentioned that why is it not<br>showing any this pointer is not working<br>the pointer is yeah if you look at the<br>self-healing materials to some of the<br>other things I'm trying to explain from<br>also fire resistance of the materials<br>that has become important then process<br>development that's very very important<br>and for that we have right rightly our<br>colleague have been picked up for BMW<br>munich for their i3 and i8 I'll give you<br>an example one of my colleagues<br>professor Simon Bickerton was seconded<br>there for three years because we have<br>developed here some kind of process<br>control and an advanced manufacturing<br>system so they were interested in that<br>and then if we look at the other areas<br>these structures and applications we<br>that office of naval research project is<br>that what are slamming when the high<br>speed of this jet boats go<br>what sort of slamming effect is there we<br>are partner is the Caltech there they<br>are doing the loading analysis and we<br>are doing the design analysis so these<br>are the main areas I try to give you an<br>overview of this thing because really we<br>don't have and much time one thing I<br>wanted to emphasize and it has been very<br>successful at least in our case that we<br>try to give associate the students with<br>some particular projects not that they<br>will be working only on that project but<br>they have some goal in the future we can<br>see all these PhD students are working<br>on projects with some related to some<br>eventual goal or industrial usage and<br>like altitude this is the new zealand's<br>now primary this<br>aircraft interior products BMW and now<br>it is changing of course BMW has<br>increased the funding so we are trying<br>to get to more students but all of them<br>are actually worked there not<br>necessarily we surrender our publication<br>rights or anything you will see from<br>next one that we have been active there<br>as well that<br>250 publications and<br>quite a bit and and quite a few keen or<br>plenary talks I'll give you a few<br>examples because there is not much time<br>there that is one thing we have done and<br>we have actually created an<br>international platform on that that we<br>blend to materials and in fact in<br>processed them in such a manner that one<br>of the materials one of the polymers can<br>be realized inside micro or nano febrile<br>in fact we are not adding any<br>reinforced reinforcement there it is<br>actually there inside and we can create<br>those yarns and those materials not only<br>from mechanical properties but it has<br>shown some other excellent properties<br>that this is the thing we do create some<br>created all these fabrics inside by<br>processing it and that creates enormous<br>strength we can also add carbon nanotube<br>create emi shielding there and<br>also the property with by chance found<br>that oxygen permeability properties are<br>also improved about three times higher<br>so we manufactured some milk containers<br>and showed that in fact the milk life<br>can be extended even after two weeks<br>after the expiry date milk was fine so<br>these things can be done finally we use<br>that material also for coronary stent we<br>are working with a<br>SAN francisco-based silicon valley-based<br>company there we are developing some<br>biodegradable stent material which will<br>have a much better mechanical property<br>and degradation property as well because<br>after degradation you will have to<br>maintain certain creep properties and<br>and that's what we can control by<br>creating this micro or nano fibrin<br>in fact what we do in fact the cell<br>another thing was the tissue scaffold<br>yad rohnke has talked about<br>electrospinning that's a very common<br>process but that involves organic<br>solvent and many sergeants are not<br>interested in having organic solvents<br>there so we have used completely one of<br>the polymers would be water soluble so<br>we used water and in fact we have<br>removed that from polymer and we created<br>this three dimensional cell structure<br>I'll show you the result and it's there<br>in fact if we look at this live date<br>stain analysis I have worked with<br>Professor Jill Cornish and in fact this<br>is the result our result is and after 14<br>days lots of live cells or a few dead<br>cells but they are comparable very much<br>to the common scaffold material that is<br>okay<br>because I want to Bob I can remove that<br>that's another thing we have created the<br>natural fibers will have to be utilized<br>renewable and so first time in and we<br>are going through a dis patenting<br>process with another German company that<br>created this natural fiber tape by<br>putting those natural fibers through a<br>process powder coating and finally this<br>tear is produced and that tape then can<br>be used in in continuous manufacturing<br>automated on a using the robots in tape<br>laying machines are available and we<br>have used them I do not want to show you<br>the video this tape can be used directly<br>for manufacturing that for very advanced<br>manufacturing so that has added another<br>side of it this is one of the things we<br>have developed for this partition when<br>you go from the cattle class to better<br>class in the and then the aircraft<br>evidently people get so frustrated they<br>kick so<br>impact the impact property had to be<br>controlled apart from the flammability<br>part control so with that in fact I<br>would like to finish I'll finish with<br>this graphene this other side we are<br>working on a nano composites area this<br>is with in fact<br>this memory cell you can see there gave<br>shape memory polymer in fact it<br>originally it was shaped like that by<br>changing the temperature or any other<br>environment afterward after 5 second it<br>will become straight and then we create<br>that to control this atmosphere it will<br>again become like that so it is it is<br>very useful in a remote place where<br>environment can be controlled and we are<br>putting graphene has been first time in<br>shape memory polymer and in fact these<br>films are so flexible with that I'd like<br>to finish and thank my<br>colleagues with fire and everything we<br>are working on both sides I would like<br>to thank all my colleagues and students<br>without them it is almost impossible I<br>just wanted to give you a glimpse of the<br>things that when a center is formed it<br>is not for<br>applying for a grant but it is<br>essentially you form the group first and<br>then try to develop a center thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
