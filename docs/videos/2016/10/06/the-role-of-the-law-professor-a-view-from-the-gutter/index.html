September.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>ladies and gentlemen may I welcome you<br>on behalf of the Faculty of Law to<br>Professor Warren Swain's<br>inaugural lecture we're here to<br>celebrate Warren becoming a professor of<br>this university people from outside the<br>Academy and some of the students in the<br>audience today might wonder about this<br>title professor in popular fiction<br>professors often get depicted as<br>crackpot inventors such as professor<br>Potts and chitty-chitty-bang-bang<br>they're portrayed as people who carry<br>out worrisome social experiments such as<br>Professor Henry Higgins in my fear lady<br>as people who are shy and sometimes<br>anti-social as in the film the<br>absent-minded professor sometimes<br>professors even get portrayed as<br>positively evil witness Professor<br>Moriarty the arch enemy of the equally<br>learned Sherlock Holmes mysterious older<br>men with magical powers but dubious<br>academic standing sometimes get called<br>professor's witness professor marvel and<br>The Wizard of Oz or professor<br>Drosselmeyer in the Nutcracker these are<br>of course exceptions those of us in the<br>Academy might prefer to identify with<br>the muscular exploits of archaeology<br>professor Indiana Jones or the quieter<br>heroism of the various professors at<br>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and<br>Wizardry the reality is less prosaic but<br>no less exceptional professor is the<br>highest rank<br>a university can bestow it's held by a<br>small minority of staff who work at this<br>University when we award the title of<br>professor it's a sign that we consider<br>that person to be a leading authority a<br>truly international scholar in his or<br>her field while this is not the first<br>lecture Warren has given since becoming<br>a professor of law here this is the<br>inaugural lecture in the sense it's the<br>occasion we have to acknowledge and to<br>recognize as standing as an academic<br>leader an authority in his field a<br>professor of law<br>at this university professor Warren<br>Swain joined the Auckland Law School in<br>June last year to get here he had only<br>to cross the Tasman from the University<br>of Queensland but Warren's journey in<br>fact starts in Yorkshire England most<br>specifically Harrogate his warm northern<br>accent his dry sense of humor his<br>willingness to pitch in and contribute<br>are perhaps typical of the sons and<br>daughters of their county his origins<br>also explain why he's made on cricket<br>his office for any of you who have been<br>there is a veritable Aladdin's cave<br>filled with William the fourth bookcases<br>leather sofas lore reports and a<br>comprehensive collection of wisdoms<br>cricketers Almanack<br>even a bottle of wine or two Warren has<br>worked in the durum in Birmingham law<br>schools but it's unsurprising to know<br>that his first academic position was at<br>Hartford College Oxford where he also<br>took his degrees his doctorate was on<br>aspects of the law of assumption<br>contract law published to international<br>critical acclaim as the law of contract<br>from 1670 to 1870 Warren has made his<br>name as a legal historian but he also<br>writes on contemporary private law and<br>across jurisdictions<br>he is currently writing a book on the<br>history of the law of contract in<br>Australia and also a biography of the<br>English judge Henry McCarty he's<br>recently co-edited a book on the leading<br>taught authority of hid Lee Boone Depina<br>into his extensive list of publications<br>once these articles on horse sales usery<br>pawnbroking and the development of<br>medical liability he is a man of broad<br>and wide raging interests this is<br>reflected in his teaching he begins some<br>of his lectures by discussing a renowned<br>painting or reading a great poem sadly I<br>see we don't have an overhead with a<br>great painting on it today but I gather<br>that we may hear from Oscar Wilde and<br>from Aesop's fables Warren produces<br>scholarship of the<br>caliber and of the quantity you would<br>expect of a world-class academic he<br>works extremely hard on his writing for<br>his teaching and as an academic leader<br>within the law faculty within a short<br>time of joining us he was appointed the<br>associate dean academic and teaching and<br>learning and I know from student leaders<br>that he's respected for his ability to<br>get things done his willingness to<br>listen to student concerns and to sort<br>out the teething problems that can arise<br>from new initiatives Warren's taken a<br>lead on a whole range of new initiatives<br>from more comprehensive and fairer<br>assessment in all courses to grading<br>policy and methods of teaching delivery<br>he is someone who cares very much about<br>the student experience about teaching<br>and learning and about the issues he<br>writes and publishers on he is as such<br>imminently qualified to talk about the<br>topic he's chosen for tonight the role<br>of the law professor would you join me<br>wish thank you Andrew for those kind<br>words and thank you everybody for coming<br>especially those we've come from across<br>the Tasman Sea in Oscar Wilde's play<br>Lady Windermere's Fan Lord Darlington<br>claimed that we are all of us in the<br>gutter but some of us are looking at the<br>Stars<br>but as Aesop's fables reminds us there<br>are dangers in stargazing an astronomer<br>was in the habit of going out every<br>evening to look at the Stars then one<br>night when he was in the suburbs<br>absorbed in contemplating the sky he<br>accidentally fell into a well a passerby<br>heard him moaning and calling out when<br>the man realized what had happened he<br>called down to him<br>hey you there you are so keen to see<br>what he's up in the sky that you don't<br>see what is down here on the ground the<br>lesson of the fable is this one could<br>apply this fable two men who boast of<br>doing wonders are and are incapable of<br>carrying out the everyday things of life<br>this lesson needs little explanation in<br>universities of all places the bullet<br>remains a useful warning when<br>considering today's theme the role of<br>the law professor those of us here of a<br>certain age may recall the children's<br>book by Richard Scarry<br>what do people do all day to came out I<br>believe in the late 60s early 1970s as<br>far as I remember from those dim and<br>distant days law professors do not<br>feature those who work for the police<br>the fire brigade or in hospitals and<br>they doubt more exciting to small<br>children it would be an odd kind of<br>preschool child that dreams have been a<br>law professor but nevertheless my talk<br>today aims to go some small way to<br>answering the same question what do law<br>professors do all day the leading<br>Canadian law academic Stephen wardens<br>had summed up the predicament of the law<br>professor rather well law teaches he<br>said I used to been attacked from<br>several directions colleagues in other<br>university faculties consider the mere<br>technicians law students think on the<br>contrary that their teachers are<br>insufficiently practical and the legal<br>profession<br>regards them as Woolley minded a woolly<br>mind each set of individuals out of<br>touch with reality I must confess that<br>there is little originality in my choice<br>of topic as long ago as October 1758 Sir<br>William Blackstone on his election to<br>the first veneering chair made the<br>subject of his own inaugural lectures a<br>discourse on the study of law on the<br>very first page he made a very conscious<br>allusion to the way that law was studied<br>at the time it has he said generally<br>being reputed note however unjustly over<br>dry and unfruitful nature and of which<br>the theoretical elementary parts of<br>hitherto<br>received a very moderate share of<br>cultivation and indeed one useful way of<br>looking at the nature of legal education<br>is to look at its history that was what<br>the great American Joyce Roscoe Pound<br>did when he spoke about the evolution of<br>legal education in his own inaugural in<br>1903 in common with pound on this I<br>suggest that some of the reasons for the<br>current state of legal education lay in<br>the past though the history of legal<br>education outside the ancient world at<br>from around 1,100 Roman law was studied<br>and taught at belong yeah<br>the first significant law professor<br>there I Nereus developed a new type of<br>legal writing a gloss was added to a<br>Roman text by where the explanation this<br>methodology was taken up by the next<br>generation known as the four doctors but<br>Garris Martinus jaqobis in healer these<br>ideas seemed spread to other great<br>European universities which were formed<br>at this time in Paris and Oxford note<br>Cambridge was a late starter in England<br>the common law was already well<br>established even though it was neither<br>told initially in oxydol in Cambridge<br>rather students were instructed in canon<br>law and civil law although it may seem<br>to us now Oxford was quite an important<br>Centre for Roman law instruction well<br>why was there this revival in legal<br>education the reason for this was quite<br>simple a complete version of the<br>important Roman tax Justinian's digest<br>was rediscovered a complete version at<br>the end of the 11th century and this<br>sparked this revival in legal education<br>well what did the early law professors<br>do well they did a bit of legal writing<br>and they delivered lectures and oversaw<br>disputations which were formal debates<br>in which students were required to<br>participate those of us or those of you<br>and perhaps all of us at one time or<br>another complain of managerialism within<br>universities will be interested to know<br>that in 1250 lecturers were forced to<br>adopt a stand<br>format for their lectures this went down<br>terribly badly at the end of their<br>degree and students before they could be<br>awarded a doctorate which was the<br>qualification at the time in Italy were<br>undertook an oral examination and again<br>this is still with us the process though<br>was described in a belonging university<br>statute of 1430 to as a demanding and<br>frightening test it has to be said that<br>Venice now the law professors were<br>rather a mixed bunch in renascence Italy<br>law professors enjoyed high status and<br>great financial rewards many served in<br>public capacities there were others who<br>lent money to their own students in<br>which case I suppose a degree of<br>knowledge at the Canon Law provision<br>song usery was useful but whatever the<br>deficiencies of European law professors<br>outside of England law professors were<br>undoubtedly custodians of legal<br>education to take one example the<br>contrast between the library debate in<br>Germany in the mid 17th century on legal<br>education with what was going on in<br>England at the time could hardly be<br>greater even across the border in<br>Scotland students received a broader<br>legal education from the 18th century<br>when three chairs were created at the<br>University of Edinburgh although I see<br>Alison is skeptical about the University<br>of Edinburgh maybe is right to be in<br>England though and this is the point<br>universities were largely proof<br>in legal education the award of a<br>doctorate in civil law enabled the<br>recipient to practice in the canon law<br>or in the civilian court and actually<br>the ecclesiastical courts it during the<br>Middle Ages were not concerned with what<br>we'd now think of ecclesiastical matters<br>but sort of striking off clergymen who<br>chase around after the choirboys<br>the courts in the Middle Ages dealt with<br>a range of matters including marriage<br>divorce legitimacy testa Maitri disputes<br>defamation the action for breach of<br>faith which in some ways mirrors the law<br>of conflict of course after the English<br>revolution ecclesiastical courts<br>whenever quite the same despite the<br>restoration<br>the second major civilian court the high<br>court of Admiralty was important but was<br>limited to matters arising on the high<br>seas so those who were taught in<br>universities were dealing only with in<br>those jurisdictions the common law on<br>the other hand which was practically<br>much more important was not taught in<br>universities until Sir William<br>Blackstone gave his famous lectures in<br>Oxford in the mid 18th century Paxton<br>despite his rhetoric wasn't that<br>concerned about legal education as he<br>made out he was concerned about making<br>money and career advancement he saw<br>these lectures as a means to both he<br>wasn't actually wrong because he ended<br>but the lectures were not within the<br>formal curriculum though it was a<br>breakthrough that lectures were<br>delivered at all and that lectures first<br>delivered in 1753 were extended to 1775<br>hours in 1754 were evidently a success<br>they would form the basis of<br>Blackstone's best-selling commentaries<br>on the laws of England Blackston was an<br>astute university politician and Julie<br>succeeded in his ambition to be the<br>first pioneer in showing 1758 but the<br>lectures were not part of the degree<br>syllabus they were merely something that<br>was delivered by way of extras and<br>Blackston left Oxford in 1761 for the<br>simple reason that people were not<br>allowed to get married in Oxford in 1761<br>unless they were heads of house<br>and black sedan wasn't so he had to<br>leave I make no comment on whether his<br>choice was a wise one his two successors<br>Sir Robert Chambers and Richard wood<br>Easton are generally seen as lesser<br>juris there's a well-founded speculation<br>that at least part of chambers lectures<br>were written by his friend Samuel<br>Johnson now we turn to Cambridge there<br>the situation was even worse the<br>president of Queens no less describes<br>civil law as a refuge of idleness and<br>ignorance<br>although Trinity Hall continued to<br>educate a large number of civilians and<br>indeed importantly the downing chair was<br>founded in 1800 which we still with us<br>the first holder Edward Christian it's<br>better known to his brother Fletcher<br>Christian of meat/meat really on the<br>bounty Fame he also edited Braxton's<br>commentaries<br>managed in between idleness and<br>ignorance to write a few books on legal<br>practice and satyrs chief justice of Ely<br>but sadly is not really the kind of<br>dynamic individual who's going to<br>establish legal education an indeed<br>common law legal education in Cambridge<br>for the most part legal education<br>remained exclusively in the hands of the<br>legal profession<br>the earliest law students known as<br>apprentices learnt the law by sitting in<br>the court in a designated area known as<br>the crib there were also some more<br>formal methods of instruction and during<br>the 14th century the Inns of Court sir<br>merged out of a group of boarding houses<br>many were short-lived but in a temple<br>middle temple grazing and Lincoln's<br>inner still with us<br>a group of Inns of lowest data scenes of<br>Chancery provided education to attorneys<br>and clerks<br>after initial training their seeking<br>admission to the bar would attend the<br>Inns of Court the process note took<br>seven years during which students took<br>part in moot attended lectures known as<br>readings and as today ate very bad food<br>in the dinners the readings though were<br>an important which were what we call<br>lectures I suppose who an important as a<br>means of passing on the collective<br>wisdom of the profession but in the<br>sixteenth and seventeenth-century<br>readings declined then they were<br>abandoned or together moot which were<br>important once in the 14th century also<br>declined in the seventeenth and survived<br>as a curious relic in a temple until the<br>1770s legal education really in the 18th<br>century in the Inns of Court was in a<br>pitiful State<br>Jayden's were left to teach themselves<br>and one writing of the period Richard<br>Campbell advised them a few well-chosen<br>authors will suffice and give the<br>students a clearer idea of this too much<br>perplexed study van if he was to read<br>the whole heap of rubbish that has been<br>written on the subject it's perhaps<br>unfair to castigate the end whence<br>matters were no better in universities<br>many of you will be familiar with Edward<br>Gibbons book ma'am<br>memoirs of my life which described how<br>the fellows in Oxford had given up the<br>pretense of teaching of his own tutor a<br>dr. Winchester he wrote that he well<br>remembered that he had a salary to<br>receive and only forgot he had a duty to<br>perform a law professors only began to<br>play a central part in English legal<br>education in the 19th century following<br>the founding of the University of London<br>in 1826 two chairs were created the<br>verse within jurisprudence and the law<br>of Nations and was filled by John Austin<br>the second was filled by Andrew Amos and<br>was on English law John Austin remains a<br>major figure in the history of<br>jurisprudence still to a degree<br>Andrew Amos is largely forgotten it is<br>though perhaps not much of a surprise<br>that Amos with his anecdotes from<br>practice history and visual aids was a<br>great success with the students and<br>indeed in some ways Amos was a visionary<br>he introduced written examinations on<br>its course with the prize for the best<br>student<br>Austan on the other hand was a failure<br>his lectures were dry and abstract he<br>undoubtedly had deficiencies as a<br>teacher rather than relying on notes<br>like Amos Austin just read out large<br>passages of text there was little<br>engagement with the audience in the<br>first year of teaching he had 35<br>students this dwindled to less than 10<br>rather like some of my own courses after<br>four years he was forced to resign from<br>his chair the common law began to be<br>taught for the first time at Oxford as<br>part of a joint degree with history in<br>1850 and separately in 1872 the law I<br>pass was introduced in Cambridge in 1858<br>the Oxford historians were relieved when<br>1872 you came along they were glad to be<br>rid of the lawyers William Stubbs no<br>less Regis professor of modern history<br>complained that the subjects were too<br>different in character but actually<br>really was all about intellectual<br>snobbery in much the same way as these<br>days media studies degrees who look down<br>upon the history professors in Oxford<br>thought law was this ghastly technical<br>trade type of thing and indeed some of<br>those who gave evidence to the<br>University of Oxford Commission which<br>was looking to the degree program' at<br>Oxford at the time suggested that nor<br>was too easy it was an easier route to a<br>outside universities legal education<br>remained in poor health but the<br>situation slowly began to improve law<br>degrees become established we get proper<br>professors<br>so great professors like Frederick<br>Maitland<br>Sir William Anson Sir Frederick Paulo<br>can remain civil in my Sir William mark<br>the Sir Thomas's skin Holland support<br>Vinogradov see you got a knighthood in<br>those days as a chair Stan comparison of<br>their successes law as a subject for<br>study oniy did grow slowly in 1909 they<br>were hundred and nine teachers of law in<br>universities by 1945 there are only 130<br>and it was only really in the 1950s that<br>law started to really be seen as<br>respectable as Brian Simpson discusses<br>in his posthumous book law really even<br>in the 1950s Oxford is release was seen<br>as a dumping ground to the stupid<br>including in that term but the academic<br>another ethereally law professors output<br>friend I see also made legal education<br>the subject of his is an oral you can<br>see those I hadn't got an original idea<br>so I just thought I'd copy then he chose<br>a provocative title can English law be<br>taught in universities dicey recognize<br>the value practical training but also<br>explored his defects I think what he<br>said still remains relevant at the<br>universities a student can be taught to<br>regard law as a whole and to consider<br>one part of English law to another at<br>the universities it can be taught can be<br>taught what from the nature of things<br>can never be learnt in chambers the<br>habit of analyzing and defining legal<br>conceptions such an analysis is not the<br>work of men wholly occupied in the daily<br>requirements of legal practice yet its<br>importance can hardly be overrated<br>practitioners still tell me that much of<br>the university syllabus is redundant I<br>keep being told that the main issues of<br>the rise for those concerned in practice<br>on the law of contract our<br>interpretation remedies and perhaps<br>contract formation this may well be true<br>but to adapt a phrase of CLR James I had<br>to get in some cricket for professor<br>Dawson what do they know of contract to<br>only interpretation no at the same time<br>it cannot be make sense that the<br>contract syllabus has largely remained<br>unchanged since the time that Queen<br>Victoria was on the throne in a humorous<br>piece on legal education James Gordon<br>gave what he called an honest course<br>description for contract law contracts<br>study rules based on a model if<br>two-fisted negotiations with equal<br>bargaining power who to you this is an<br>American phrase dicker freely<br>voluntarily agree on all terms<br>and reduce their understanding to a<br>writing intended to embody their full<br>agreement learn that the last contract<br>fitting this model was signed in 1879<br>there is a good deal of truth in this<br>caricature part of the problem is the<br>way in which students are left without<br>even a flavor of context as something<br>basic as standard forms let alone<br>long-term contract in globalization<br>consumer law to name but a few<br>deficiencies despite a vast and<br>sophisticated body of theoretical<br>literature insights from such literature<br>forms almost no part of any contract<br>course that I'm aware of but this<br>tension between legal practice and<br>universities is an old one as long as<br>both exist it won't be eradicated it's<br>the same issuing has been that faced<br>early academic laws in New Zealand law<br>professors in fact are obviously often<br>poor advocates for their discipline<br>although it has to be said that both<br>sides of the argument are not always shy<br>about displays of arrogance the same<br>fiction Earth's friction albeit in a<br>different form is found when it comes to<br>the second aspect of the work of a law<br>professor writing and thinking about the<br>law the title of this section legal<br>research hardly like finding a cure for<br>a fatal disease comes from a remark of a<br>former colleague the University of<br>Birmingham at his retirement party in a<br>way of course he was right but it does<br>not follow as he implied that legal<br>research is unimportant or has LeFleur<br>value yet once again an examination of<br>the history of legal writing shows that<br>it comes out distinctly second-best at<br>least in the common law when set against<br>the civilian writers but let's start<br>with legal writers he mattered and the<br>roman juris the jurists were distinctly<br>Roman invention<br>it's my old cheater Peter Burke's once<br>said it's curious about the Romans and<br>the Greeks at the Romans that the Greeks<br>produced all this philosophy art<br>democracy the Roman system was not<br>largely at least laterally democratic<br>and they produce the greatest legal<br>system the world has ever seen but the<br>early Joris were priests and once<br>details of legal procedure were made<br>public secular jurists start to emerge<br>they become really important figures and<br>in a legal system in which the judges<br>are laypeople<br>those who are experts on the law are<br>important but it wasn't just that they<br>began the process of thinking about the<br>substance of law and indeed academic<br>disputes are not new in the middle of<br>the second century AD the juries form<br>themselves into two hated rival armed<br>camps the Sabine ins and the peculiar<br>it's unclear whether there were<br>educational establishments or merely<br>groups who shared a common opinion but<br>they were shall we say vibrant<br>intellectual disagreements between them<br>as far as the work of Joyce as a source<br>of law is concerned the Institute's of<br>gaius the author Gaius if it was guys<br>lists the following of sources of law<br>the laws of the Roman people consist of<br>leg a platter site centers consulates<br>Imperial constitutions we're getting<br>there<br>edik sat those possessing the right to<br>issue them and the answers of the learn<br>it the answers of the learners were<br>important in another text Gaius informs<br>us that if the jurists were all agreed<br>then that opinion had force of law where<br>there was a disagreement a judge was<br>free to choose this course chaos Berlin<br>in 46<br>d the law citations produced a method of<br>deciding who was to be followed it was a<br>kind of head counting in the event of a<br>tie one of the jurors opinion was to<br>have the casting vote the great jurist<br>papillion poor Gaius Oh peon continued<br>to influence legal development long<br>after their death through the European<br>legal system the rediscovery of Roman<br>law already mentioned didn't just<br>reinvigorate legal education<br>reinvigorated legal scholarship and<br>intellectualizing the law and in the<br>fifteenth century Roman law combined<br>with canon law would form the basis of<br>private law costs Europe the so called<br>us commune a theologians played an<br>important part and big ideas were<br>involved here so an important group of<br>jury selected elastics began to<br>synthesize Roman law canon law with the<br>philosophy of Aristotle and Aquinas in<br>the 16th century the humanist writers<br>began to promote law as a subject that<br>was necessary to produce complete and<br>cultivated individuals who Hart<br>exercised moral virtue this was combined<br>with enthusiasm for classical writers by<br>the 17th century natural lawyers built<br>on the humanistic preference the kind of<br>scientific arrangement and logic of its<br>kind even if they shed some of the other<br>tenants of their auditing legal<br>scholarship in France in Germany divers<br>in the 18th and 19th centuries but but<br>dureth in both countries were important<br>in the French Civil Code and the Germans<br>have occurred the BTB they're all played<br>by Joris in the common law on the other<br>and was rather more peripheral with<br>judges rather than jurors who important<br>of course some lock some were both<br>Blackston already mentioned was a rather<br>second-rate Chief Justice of the Common<br>Pleas and this remains true to our own<br>time were three Law Lords for example or<br>gothy sadly passed away recently Hoffman<br>and Roger were Occident<br>two of those three were important legal<br>scholars the legal literature on the<br>other hand of private law with largely a<br>narrative fair there were law books of<br>course most of these were concerned with<br>legal procedure but between Bratton's<br>long customs of england in 1260 and<br>Blackstone's commentaries there isn't<br>much written on private law unless you<br>look at things like thomas Littleton's<br>10 years on property law the first true<br>treatise in my owner the law of contract<br>was written by Jeffery Gilbert in 1720<br>for this was very influenced by Roman<br>law and the writings of Thomas Hobbes<br>Gilbert was important because he<br>portrayed the law of contract as a<br>coherent whole with a distinct<br>theoretical rationale with detailed<br>rules<br>this work was unpublished it was<br>followed by the misleadingly tide called<br>treatise of equity of 1737 attributed to<br>henry ballo and probably not written by<br>henry Balor but below attempted to blend<br>proof endorsed version of natural law<br>with the common law then he do that was<br>not surprising natural law was well it<br>was fashionable at the time but the<br>attempt to link the two was never really<br>a terribly successful contract law<br>though starts to be of interested people<br>who are not really lawyers so Adam Smith<br>and the moral philosopher William Paley<br>they began to take notice of the<br>subjects these men were not writers of<br>legal treatise but they had an interest<br>in this respect these men were closer to<br>the mainstream European writers they<br>were think as they were scholars they<br>were like European juris most of the<br>writers on the law of contract were very<br>different types of individuals there<br>were not law professors jurists or even<br>intellectuals of any kind they were in<br>effect tack practitioners who thought to<br>make their name by writing on the<br>subject and selling books some of them<br>did a fairly good job indeed Joseph<br>chitti practical treatise on the law of<br>contracts was first published in 1826 a<br>31st edition still remains in print so<br>perhaps our aney that the most<br>influential jurist on private law in<br>England before the 1870s was not English<br>he was a Frenchman Robert Jersey partier<br>who'd been translated into English by<br>Sir William Evans in 1806 Partiers basic<br>premise was that contracts are formed by<br>meetings of wills meeting of mind and<br>from this he constructed a whole theory<br>and rationale it's not surprising that<br>he appealed to more English writers of a<br>more theoretical bent like Sir Henry<br>Colebrook but he also appealed to judges<br>the reason I think for this which is<br>discussed in my last book at great<br>length still available in remainder<br>shops actually he came at the right time<br>in that English law at the time was<br>trying to construct a new model of<br>contract and judges and lawyers it was<br>easy just to pull a book down from the<br>show<br>in time this theory was blended with<br>English law and that created attention<br>writing in the 1880s the jurist I see<br>again said of this earlier generation of<br>legal writers though perhaps not partyer<br>that they had learnt law without<br>mastering its principles the Oxford<br>contemporary Sir William Anson explained<br>in the preface to his principles of<br>contract or the main object with which I<br>have set out has been to delineate the<br>general principles which govern<br>contractual relations from beginning to<br>end<br>the idea that contract law bujji's two<br>principles had earlier echo certainly<br>but had a new level of sophistication in<br>the works of Anson and Sir Frederick<br>Pollock Anson also became quite retching<br>that his treatise sold in large numbers<br>and was influential on generations of<br>law students but largely still the<br>impetus for most legal writing came from<br>the legal profession robbing<br>universities it was a way than a young<br>though it's important still to note New<br>Zealand reference coming up that the<br>influence of Joyce on the law of<br>contract was more significant much more<br>significant than on the law of tort we<br>perhaps the early exception of the<br>well-known New Zealand legal writer Sir<br>John salmon in who wrote a book on the<br>subject in 1807 I say this in front of<br>professor beaver and I'm sure he'd agree<br>with me that in the absence of a<br>generally agreed and accepted<br>intellectual framework tort law remained<br>a disorganized jumble in many respects<br>it still does it compare to flea rare<br>though for a modern Joyce to shape a<br>whole area of private law one obvious<br>example be the late Professor Peter<br>Burke's and he's working on just<br>enrichment in England though fashions<br>change judges I can say this with I<br>think anyone present can be fickle the<br>High Court of Australia that showed<br>itself hostile to Burke's his analysis<br>preferring instead to draw on equitable<br>principles but Burke's if nothing else<br>cannot be accused of failing to address<br>large themes and few writers have had<br>such a profound impact the more limited<br>influence of academics tends to involve<br>more specific areas of legal doctrine<br>rather than shaping a whole subject and<br>indeed modern studies has shown the<br>impact of writing a sporadic at best<br>the high court certainly on what they<br>now don't call unjust enrichment in<br>Australia wisely cited me so one can<br>have an impact in a small way but having<br>a large impact is much more difficult<br>and judges in the United States in<br>particular have argue that there's a<br>disconnect between what legal academics<br>write about on what legal practitioners<br>are interests<br>within that jurisdiction much of the<br>work is highly theoretical much of it<br>elegantly constructed other pieces of<br>legal writing at least to me are<br>incomprehensible and I give you an<br>example I challenge anyone to make sense<br>of Peter gable and Duncan Kennedy roll<br>over Beethoven in the 1984 Stanford Law<br>Review<br>Duncan Kennedy being a really actually<br>important legal right one commentators<br>described this famous article as<br>sounding like a pair of old acid heads<br>chewing over passage in Sartre Kennedy<br>though undoubtedly an important figure<br>facile I had a long list to choose here<br>and grateful to my former colleague<br>professor Ross Grantham for suggesting<br>this by Scott hatch of it Harry Potter<br>and the trouble with talk theory which<br>appeared in the Stanford Law Review in<br>2010 you can have a jolly evening<br>reading that it's rather long I'm not<br>suggesting note that theoretical writing<br>about private noise pointless activity<br>called the opposite and indeed it can be<br>a frustrating exercise to make sense of<br>law without a normative structure<br>although reasonable people can differ on<br>a great deal of modern academic writing<br>it has to be said it's very bad indeed<br>I can only plead me a Copa it's not<br>entirely the fault of academics even the<br>New Zealanders elsewhere the pressure to<br>publish without having much to say<br>simply reflects the requirements of the<br>PBRs but all the same these pessimistic<br>thoughts should not entirely obscure the<br>contribution that legal writers have<br>made and may continue to make my point<br>rather is the one that unlimited the<br>limited influence of common-law right is<br>ease is important but has been somewhat<br>piecemeal and indeed into recently law<br>professors within the common living<br>marginal really figures there is good<br>legal writing it can be fueled and<br>perhaps should be fueled by anger or at<br>least a belief that the laws it stands<br>is not quite right<br>writing of this sort is an important<br>safety valve sometimes it can even<br>the remaining 20% which I'm going to say<br>something briefly about it's the topic<br>that will interest many of us and that's<br>administration as many of you know I sit<br>on many university committees including<br>several with the deputy vice-chancellors<br>in the front row and the contracts of<br>employment of professors typically<br>require that 20% of time is spent on<br>service what this means actually<br>something of a mystery certainly law<br>professors can provide important public<br>service some actors public intellectuals<br>as Professor calcium the second row is<br>an excellent example others are involved<br>in law reform one of my predecessors in<br>this law faculty made a significant<br>contribution which should really be<br>noted to drafting the New Zealand<br>contract statute<br>in the United States law professors who<br>were members of the American Law<br>Institute are involved in joining up<br>Restatement the same idea as was made<br>clear to me by Andy burrows when I met<br>him recently is now catching on in<br>England orbit on a smaller scale some<br>law professors such as myself are unable<br>to aspire to such greatness our lot is<br>to sit down in the middle of the night<br>trying to keep the good ship of the<br>University and faculty moving forward<br>and I want to finish with some remarks<br>on administration and politics as an<br>amateur in such matters I have drawn<br>inspiration from others the best book<br>that I know on bureaucracy of any kind<br>is Parkinson's Law by C Northcote<br>Parkinson he's best known for the idea<br>that work expands to fill the time for<br>completion he said much else besides his<br>discussion axe this is brilliant his<br>discussion of the workings of Finance<br>Committee's is particularly insightful<br>his later work and the discussion I can<br>summarizes that it's a firm they're<br>talking about what do we spend money on<br>they spend Massey's amount of time on<br>trivial things like the cost of a bike<br>shed things have vast importance and<br>vast cost go through on the nod it's<br>later work in laws and out in-laws and<br>outlaws it's a useful guide for anyone<br>wanting to ascend a greasy pole within<br>any organization the chapter on the<br>function of folly is worth five minutes<br>of anyone's time universities of course<br>are a special kind of organization<br>Cardinal Newman and others have given a<br>great deal of consideration to the<br>philosophical value of universities<br>which is important<br>but this in oral is a view from the<br>gutter<br>let's therefore breathe some less<br>rarefied air universities as over large<br>institutions or political institutions<br>almost all the types of personality that<br>can be found amongst the academic staff<br>in universities are contained in CP<br>snows unjustly forgotten masterpiece the<br>Masters I'm not sure how many of you<br>have read it but it is a masterpiece the<br>plot concerns the election of a new<br>master to a Cambridge poly the<br>characters in the novel provide a useful<br>cross-section of university life the<br>devious the naive the openly ambitious<br>the quietly ambitious the disengaged the<br>by coincident the best work on academic<br>politics was written by a Cambridge Don<br>as long against 1908<br>his name was FN Cornford Cornford is<br>particularly good on arguments that were<br>used in Cambridge at the time and no<br>doubt still against any form of change<br>there are a number time only permits me<br>for two personal favourites the first<br>the principle of the wedge states that<br>you should not act justly now for fear<br>of raising expectations which you are<br>afraid that you would not have the<br>courage to satisfy<br>the wedge argument implies the admission<br>that the person who uses it cannot prove<br>that the action is not just on the other<br>hand the principle of a right time the<br>principle of a right time is that people<br>should not do at the present moment what<br>they think is right at that moment<br>because the moment at which they<br>thinking right but not yet arrived time<br>has a trick of going rotten before it is<br>ripe alas time for me has become ripe<br>and so it is now time to stop talking<br>well thanks some thanks very much Warren<br>we all we will greatly enjoy enjoyed<br>that<br>professor Swain has drawn upon his<br>expertise in legal history and the law<br>of contracts to provide us with a<br>fascinating account of legal education<br>and legal scholarship in the common law<br>tradition which sets the emerging world<br>of professors of law in the context of<br>the generally far more developed<br>educational institutions of civil law<br>jurisdictions professor Swain's<br>broad-ranging scholarly and erudite<br>treatment of this history and of the<br>work of those 19th century scholars who<br>began to forge a distinct identity for<br>legal education and legal scholarship<br>within the university demonstrates the<br>commitment to teaching research and the<br>advancement of legal education that have<br>marked his career to date his inaugural<br>also gives us a foretaste of the sort of<br>contributions that he will make as a<br>professor of law at the University of<br>Auckland please join with me in thanking<br>professor Swain for his lecture and in<br>wishing him ongoing success in his<br>career<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
