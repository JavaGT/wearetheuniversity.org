font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>director the ambition of this panel is<br>not so much the rather easy gesture of<br>thinking outside the box but rather to<br>collectively think through some of the<br>consequences of their box that is the<br>shipping container the shipping<br>container is an object or or better in<br>empty space into which a vast multitude<br>of objects can be placed there's of<br>enough interest in its own right since<br>nineteen fifty-seven the standardized<br>shipping container is revolutionized not<br>only shipping but is brought into<br>national and international trade and<br>with this the work activity the lives of<br>other people into closer contact then<br>was ever before imaginable as you'll<br>hear from the speakers on the panel<br>today the shipping container is vital in<br>global supply chains and work on and off<br>ships as a key locus of struggle and<br>conversation of what we call logistical<br>capable ISM further and perhaps less<br>obviously the shipping container is now<br>widely used to home surplice migrant<br>working populations and also bears its<br>own quite specific box prints in terms<br>of its impact and the casualties caused<br>with boxes moving across the globe in<br>some ways the shipping container is an<br>interdisciplinary for what is perhaps<br>better described as a disciplinary<br>object brings with it a basket of<br>technical economic social and ecological<br>questions the character of this object<br>is shared by a range of a range of other<br>objects that are of interest today from<br>climate change migration oil<br>transportation housing to finance<br>logistics in the algorithm the technical<br>and social composition of presence alone<br>the future is radically calling into<br>question the borders that were<br>constructed between<br>demic disciplines in the 19th century<br>and were extended and expanded through<br>the 20th if the world today consists of<br>relations connectivity and flows well<br>the Academy thinks principally in terms<br>of discrete particulars then this is an<br>academy that has little to say about how<br>world this is a charge the way is just<br>as heavily on the social sciences and<br>the humanities that eschew the technical<br>as it does on the physical and technical<br>sciences when they're unable or<br>unwilling to think the social economic<br>political and philosophical significance<br>of their objects in disciplinary objects<br>such as shipping containers do not call<br>for networked teams of researchers<br>bringing together the latest from each<br>of their separate disciplines rather<br>they propose a fundamental challenge to<br>disciplinary isolation as such into the<br>defensive postures taken by the<br>presumably safe identity of the<br>professor of this or that they disrupt<br>the identity and the local interests of<br>the observer and in doing so they<br>promise and you the prospect of science<br>science being of course I'm only<br>meaningfully a discourse without a<br>subject a language irreducible to the<br>particularity zuv the observer in this<br>sense the challenge of in disciplinary<br>objects such as the shipping container<br>and arguably most every object of which<br>we've spoken its day is that these<br>objects call disciplinary site are<br>challenged disciplinary silos and<br>radically challenged the separation of<br>the scientific investigator from other<br>people therefore like to think and to<br>welcome my colleagues have taken up the<br>challenge to their disciplines and to<br>themselves to speak today about a<br>shipping container and its movement<br>each speaker will take up one thing<br>Richard that the wrong will speak about<br>napping and national and thinking<br>movements Christina surround will speak<br>about working on ships Natalie shark<br>will speak about resisting and striking<br>against logistical capitalism Frances<br>colonists will speak about the use of<br>shipping containers and how service<br>populations will show consequence in<br>about the impacts of shipping on the<br>most ancient mammals of our seas the<br>business to common platitude to speak<br>about the importance of thinking outside<br>the box just as well no other business<br>that as the saying goes the easiest way<br>to think outside the box is to make sure<br>that the box is really really small<br>thank you in for being here to my<br>colleagues who I joining them in<br>reclaiming what ends today to think big<br>and in asserting that this box and by<br>extinction outside of this box many<br>other apparently in these faces today is<br>even bigger than white at first we<br>thought and beyond this we assert our<br>capacity as finite mortals have the<br>capacity to thank thing thank you for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
