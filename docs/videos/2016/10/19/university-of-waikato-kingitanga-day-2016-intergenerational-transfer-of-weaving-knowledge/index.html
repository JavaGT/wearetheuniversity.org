bye<br>so I'm go character cannot ethically<br>wrong naughty man important keno happy<br>Apple khuda wake up to 240 for me<br>valuable earring<br>I'm going to be reading through my<br>lights and just going backwards and<br>forth but<br>got my time one<br>Malia's pistol mala geology emanates<br>from the celestial realm of the gods<br>walker 2004 with the sand mind of a lot<br>philosophical principles of Radha Hoffa<br>to our culmination of many facets of<br>inquiry and discovery the tomb can he<br>hear and mighty terms to seek which<br>provides an imminent pathway to further<br>inquiry through one's own desire to<br>engage the end of generational knowledge<br>trencher is about the food arco behind<br>each of the car kaho and the time<br>periods beginning with my<br>great-grandmother<br>Mittleman palma and at her time she she<br>went through a hair time in life you<br>know how do you when you think about how<br>do you<br>try to put a person's life and in an<br>extraordinary like that that in each and<br>every one I I think it's extraordinary<br>from my great-grandmother<br>downton ourselves but mediterra will<br>Palmer mark she went through alienation<br>land confiscation assimilation<br>insubordination at the time of<br>transitional changes that took place in<br>how she would have experienced all these<br>changes as a teenager she was one of the<br>children<br>who escaped from the after your church<br>in<br>1914 when all Marling me woman and<br>children were locked into church in bed<br>so I'm leading up to Manimal to have<br>them in the story she helped her mother<br>she helped a mother and child escaped<br>the answer little soldiers the Redcoats<br>junior auto co battle medley after<br>running out after your church messica so<br>she was and she knew what was coming she<br>also attended petty hubba to support the<br>pass of existence those are some of the<br>key these are some of the stories you<br>know I'm just going to be a brief<br>there that we're taught that we are told<br>and let me hold onto which helps with<br>our motto hoping manometer and then of<br>course is my and in this cloak<br>represents medical home once time I look<br>at this and I see the stories so I tell<br>the story stream the weaving through the<br>cargo and then of course my grandmother<br>who died at the rail roko maybe of a<br>hundred and three and the one thing she<br>method medic met mathematically a<br>technician of myths she couldn't figure<br>out Roger<br>however her father was kept captive by<br>the money portal chief in real life and<br>they realized his skills could they<br>could capitalize on his skills her<br>father being Charles with his house and<br>he was actually a survey so with this in<br>mind my grandmother mediterra one palmar<br>in bagay bombarding next the reason for<br>he lame<br>because of the rift between the two the<br>Chiefs of money little eNOS their father<br>so she was born out by her mother mainly<br>and by the time here far her father come<br>together at the age of 12 there was no<br>way that she was going to leave<br>the person's of their mother but because<br>she only knew have asleep that if she<br>only knew one way nepeta been mulling<br>ways and she was widowed at the age of<br>49 and<br>due to her husband after returning from<br>World War one but beside that she's well<br>known for him retaining the arts or brad<br>enough especially and photo Coco but<br>it's the stories behind all of those<br>that makes the reserve it's about<br>resistance and resilience so this is the<br>one of whom any car goes you know<br>thinking which one should I choose<br>multiple woman it doesn't neither<br>then of course comes down to my mum the<br>grease that I need to attend to come<br>away<br>born in nineteen twenty as a child she<br>was sickly and of course going through<br>the police state she loved reading no<br>she she enjoyed embracing education and<br>and it was prominent that the the photo<br>social change was happening<br>she was also the pulley of milling<br>uptick akhada which is a one and<br>they're me and when she told this his<br>her stories to her she talked about how<br>she had it wasn't a toughening which he<br>looked into the property being DD young<br>a young child virgin child and she<br>walked into meeting with a couple she<br>said it was just a hole or happened to<br>her and she knew from there it was<br>something that she had to do in her life<br>there would be a<br>gift of consequences<br>to her people into her children blame us<br>and then it cuz it comes the other<br>comes down to<br>this is the Carter who she made for my<br>debt for the wrong<br>love she had for him coca-cola that<br>cargo I remember<br>helping the making of me because came<br>under the mattress we don't know from<br>where and intended into Coco<br>so the continuum or<br>intergenerational knowledge transfer or<br>the legacy carries on through my older<br>sisters we had Anna Maria Davis my let<br>me to a 32 gonna love myself my nieces<br>varun all hit at home where he ho were<br>all clouding our time third and my<br>grandnieces so six generations from my<br>grave women and this is a theory in<br>research methodology I have adopted and<br>using the technical patent and it's<br>via a<br>with the set of the particular so it's<br>the male put in qatar qatar these here<br>represent<br>the support the black coming into to the<br>brown which is the valley kaha<br>the yellow that only co and there and<br>the city is the butt of my own the<br>spiritual kind of which we see things<br>and I've based my mythology on the<br>technique of technical how the threads<br>behind support and illuminates the one<br>and it's why the change of clothes<br>how is intergenerational transfer really<br>traditional purpose Pierce Bible reading<br>okay so besides their the stories I've<br>just told quickly and<br>I'm working on a piece<br>down so there's that we<br>in these this all of the pieces that<br>we've we've done that the one<br>the purple this has never actually been<br>done before and I'm started to<br>researchers when I was editor burning<br>room<br>Hamilton Augustus hem deposited acacia<br>been fixed today otago museum and called<br>the purple all this piece here array<br>so their exhibition that I intend is<br>going to be about the higher<br>consciousness of thought and scores of<br>the unknown leader I can tell the story<br>about our our family like what you've<br>just wouldn't very quickly and and I<br>decided to call it from the red rag to<br>richness it's the richness the<br>consciousness of the Weaver<br>our focus is toward eliminating the<br>abrizzle at realism and what is<br>seemingly trivial aspects within our co<br>couple always experienced weavers may be<br>taken for greater than our lives there's<br>only worth further questioning and<br>transformation of thinking that one is a<br>deeper desire or passion to rediscover<br>new scenarios knowledge in functionality<br>that one can be in the state of<br>contextualizing meaning to purpose he's<br>the reason why I want to bring to life<br>the<br>consciousness tried it of the wheeler<br>because this piece cannot even be seen<br>so I'm going to replicate it to tell the<br>story and I want to input only operative<br>together so we work with an upper limit<br>in a system illogical hologram based on<br>the support of how I feel on the values<br>of rationality and these chemical it<br>categorizes the thought of the Henley<br>nuttall technical regionality which is<br>the microcosm of designing our system of<br>knowledge and that<br>defines our understanding so that it<br>becomes our mission our monomyth level<br>10 are no hermeneutic rationality is a<br>subject to different interpretation so<br>as I'm weaving what I mean is I can<br>actually change what I'm doing I might<br>have something in my mind but I can<br>change it so it's subjective different<br>changes in very perspective of evolving<br>and engaging knowledge thus it evaluates<br>a little patterns inmates<br>then there's the way of the emancipatory<br>rationalizing the filing ones over<br>freedom of discovery through embracing<br>knowledge that has a functionally<br>purpose this is an area we can witness<br>our purpose of what we have engaged<br>to reach our goals<br>so if we seek the essence of our aural<br>and visual language we become more<br>familiar with<br>the notion of realist of thinking and<br>practical peace terms by this on me<br>pocket okie forked all right on a photo<br>and call Phi Phi had Misha's is that<br>will see a person's way home to our<br>truths of existence here the effing<br>here's the essence of mana motuhake a<br>truly out of aural and visual engagement<br>the truth of existence is encapsulated<br>in visual narratives in we're dead air<br>potentiality and ready to the knowing<br>over list the words that I'll quickly go<br>through up upper usually refers to<br>our genealogy in it then various<br>perspectives of by button for me in<br>this case the a Papa depends the<br>way in which we knowledge and which our<br>knowledge as subject methods becomes the<br>quote above the foundation of<br>objectivity that is derived from the<br>linnean of sequential notions of<br>realities<br>the manor is often referred to prestige<br>respect and honor<br>mullen this context is a reveal aspect<br>of knowledge skills that are taken to<br>topic which defines treat and relevance<br>to context given<br>substance and meaning to our own<br>interpretations of civility religion<br>language<br>the monarch Adam to give and show<br>support still willing to keeping the<br>meaning of this word we engage in Malaga<br>Toma by reflecting on the own<br>understanding and taking time to listen<br>to interpret and share thoughts and to<br>get engaged by showing interest in<br>sharing discussion on the subject matter<br>in the up on similar to my market<br>and how in this case to be truthful the<br>engagement<br>discussion<br>taboo to respect and on each other<br>skills knowledge and thoughts however<br>not in a way to restrict ourselves from<br>the molle the life evans or false<br>metaphorically in another context is a<br>combination of<br>farnham eaten an<br>expression of phonology of would<br>coordinate another depth and knowledge<br>m-madam antenna in lightning of their<br>knowledge and of course above all else<br>autoplay they love the care the<br>sincerity in the Honorable relationships<br>you have with materials in people it's<br>around you in your mentors<br>so when you put<br>combined mon amour to have been together<br>when i'm referring to here this<br>engagement of a distinctive issue on of<br>knowledge through only am loving<br>practice<br>just go through these and what I did was<br>scientifically look at the materials and<br>seeing if I was right about my notion of<br>but I had to convince the doctors and<br>scientists Edna to torture papers that<br>it was not had a Kiki like they thought<br>it was cute<br>I just when I looked at it I said it's<br>Kiki and they said how do you know that<br>thought that was weird but then I<br>realized to hang on them on a backup<br>so I'm doing samples at the moment just<br>to give you some idea that these are<br>strains are less than 1 nil<br>it's about two and a half<br>further have thousands brave think to<br>myself why did I decide to do this but<br>anyway so yeah we have our our<br>trophies but I like we're stopping but<br>anal des autres not to Britain Italy out<br>of terms and things but the inward<br>significance of this is exactly what I<br>want to do before<br>so there is a<br>mod strang up a few ideas you know it is<br>a heart finger<br>so quickly cancel that out<br>wherever the heart feels nourish go<br>there and that's why I've gone leave<br>it's out of my door here but it's this<br>is about our knowledge that Weaver to<br>honor here to bring back there Richie's<br>2000 and it's also about parkour hung at<br>the gift of giving<br>we can never stop giving<br>my third only behind the practice look<br>this you can read it for yourself is<br>this what I'm trying to say<br>and these some of the people you know it<br>resonates a lot of these resonate with</p></main><footer
