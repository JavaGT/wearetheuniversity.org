accurate.</p><p>home where businesses and Australia and<br>New Zealand and I like came that because<br>they're really affordable you can pick<br>out some really good stuff Polynesia<br>kind of offer the kiwiana tight home win<br>however none of these businesses offer<br>tadele multi-home beer so for me was<br>just like whoa groundbreaking like no<br>one else is doing this is the first of<br>its kind and for me that's exciting and<br>a lot of people would be like bar<br>necklaces so simple and I'll say to them<br>yeah so simple like why hasn't anyone<br>done this before you know mmm so this is<br>me so since februari the program hit<br>finish and I decided that this was<br>something that I really wanted to do and<br>I see that my website which you can<br>visit dad dad dad taco taco del ends<br>here I feel quite flesh saying that I've<br>got like a bit right quite cool but when<br>you're like a design student you can<br>design stuff like they're in so I set up<br>my website so does selling online very<br>low key so I wanted to make sure that I<br>didn't put it out on Facebook straight<br>away I did it hit media straight away<br>because i needed to understand how to<br>manufacture put juice my products seen<br>them out before i get you on our<br>skinning orders n which is actually<br>because I felt that worth Tucker Tucker<br>it was something that I needed to<br>protect first and it was something that<br>was new it was innovative hadn't been<br>seen before so for me I wanted to make<br>sure that I got everything right cross<br>the t's stop the eyes exit row hmm so<br>the journey from match to about april<br>may and university had heard about what<br>i was getting up to they're selling<br>online and they wanted to help out after<br>year cool so they've released this media<br>release I don't really know what that<br>was to be honest by forgive Eric put it<br>out there so they sent it out to the<br>networks like I think everyone in New<br>Zealand this is like multi TV New<br>Zealand he rolled by huttle times too<br>cuddly everybody were then like I don't<br>know a day less than that when that<br>media release taken out everything just<br>went born like spikes and it was quite<br>exciting but it was quite scary as well<br>so I was getting calls from New Zealand<br>hero bike at all times getting<br>interviews and orders just went out the<br>roof within a week I had over 50 orders<br>and orders were coming in on the hour<br>which was like oh my gosh can I actually<br>handle this they're clicks no right at<br>me in the middle and we hate to sit up a<br>bit of a tough it up with victory it at<br>home got some nights I'll and wait to<br>pump out I think 44 orders that night so<br>I'm very lucky to have good mates and<br>then I came to help out because to<br>produce it nanos and products yeah I<br>don't think I would have done it on my<br>own and so from near order tipping<br>steady since that day and something that<br>I have implemented since i started with<br>it I want to make Tucker Tucker walk in<br>it so in there is I want to feed it the<br>right nutrients and I don't want to and<br>quick fast the process of this right I<br>don't want it to be like a really and<br>yeah I want this I want the prices to be<br>slow<br>nurtured and so in saying that I don't<br>want to apply for loans basically I<br>don't want to seek and visas because and<br>it brings the pressure or having 20<br>people money i owe the bank money and<br>for me when your student hello we<br>already owe you money so I didn't want<br>to owe any more money I didn't want to<br>stress myself out whilst trying to be a<br>student and whilst trying to run a<br>business I thought if I can just manage<br>it on my own getting orders and that<br>would be cool so how I'll manage there<br>is that people pre-order so they wipe<br>the product first I then make it and<br>then send it out and I'm very lucky that<br>my customers are happy to wait until the<br>order so like when you buy something<br>online usually get it within the next<br>two days but for me I tell my customers<br>it's going to take a month until you get<br>your order in the organs with it so<br>quite doing pre grating of interviewer<br>settings small business pre-ordering as<br>the wagon because then you're not losing<br>out on any money and yes and business so<br>far in I'm getting profit in which is<br>cool and I'm not indeed and I haven't<br>actually invested any of my money until<br>it year which is cool it's running on<br>itself they're organic process some of<br>the challenges low and there is a I'm<br>trying to find somewhere that could like<br>Prince way onto the bus but at the<br>moment it's unclear sticker it's a<br>durable plastic abut ideally I would<br>love to have a feature<br>it could just print them straight on<br>there's my main challenge at the moment<br>is trying to find it who could do that<br>for me my other challenge is that it's<br>quite hard doing it on your own like I<br>see before i hit makes to come and have<br>me but the challenge is trying to push<br>the orders out and keep up with the<br>demand so of late the last month of its<br>put sold out on my website just to give<br>myself a break because yeah in at all<br>like I can do this I'm just like yep<br>sold out no I cannot afford any borders<br>just want to break guys but keeping up<br>with you keeping up with the demand is<br>my one of my biggest challenges at the<br>moment and to ya overall I guess what<br>I'm trying to say is we know locate who<br>I am and where I come from come from a<br>small family isolated city I'm moldy<br>from a solo parent home so the suspects<br>are already against me I guess when I<br>look at it but what I've learned along<br>the way it is it don't be confined by<br>your circumstances because it's your<br>circumstances that don't confine you if<br>it makes sense and look for<br>opportunities if you come from a similar<br>background to mine or even harder we<br>have to take the step out there any to<br>look for opportunities things aren't<br>going to be offered to you on a platter<br>you have to work for it and you have to<br>apply yourself know when you see things<br>you think I'll it's a good idea well go<br>for it apply apply yourself is probably<br>what I want to encourage you today and<br>this meantime oh and before I wake up<br>I'll play for you this little clip get<br>my mate home he'd made there is an<br>epithet evading the whole of the Moldy<br>world in the language as its victim and<br>so the Moldy world wakes up to the fit<br>that unless it does something<br>language is going to die these words<br>from timoti karetu will be the constant<br>reminder of the wife

ya gotta get up it's a cotton top<br>it off you started in 2015 and maybe<br>worth now supplying for the wipe out all<br>summer start out scholarship program<br>basically I was brainstorming about an<br>idea that I could come up with a social<br>enterprise business and this is what I<br>came out with what stuff it's a food<br>basically it's about combining design<br>into your multi together and creating to<br>do Molly home wins as a way to bring to<br>their body into homes into a code<br>encourage pano tou quoted on Mardi PDF<br>in the future pawtucket supper I see<br>Saddam re being normalized so everywhere<br>we go we see it in our homes and offices<br>and organizations and schools everywhere<br>so that's my angles have its upper in<br>ultimately i wanna see in help other<br>indigenous languages explicitly language<br>one of my highlights of doing taku taku<br>as i get a message from a good friend on<br>my back and gasp and she had ordered her<br>ass it and she messaged me saying now<br>that she's got her tuffet opposite in<br>her kitchen it's now encouraged her to<br>learn to da mall d so she's Molly from<br>the coast but he's never really<br>connected to

two who children and Sileo party<br>she's looking at different classes that<br>she can take she's moving that total to<br>do i and what's to put her girls into<br>Cortana and there for me is exciting and<br>I'm like man this is why I'm doing tofu<br>tofu is to help families and to call it<br>or moldy and how people connect to the<br>indigenous language says it's a<br>highlight a mine each stage and taboo<br>taboo is to get mighty orders out the<br>smug no pressure but if anyone like<br>what's the help that would be really<br>cool yeah 90 waters on those like poor<br>health but um yeah I can offer like pie<br>and it may be a cool huh but ya hala my<br>is gonna help and then definitely the<br>next stage like I'm thinking next year<br>as China I think if I need too many<br>picture bulk of my products as China as<br>where it's it I like so like many<br>picture here New Zealand but<br>unfortunately it's really expensive so<br>I'm making the move to go to China I<br>don't know how I'm going to get there I<br>might have to start peddling now but<br>I'm just talking it out there because I<br>believe that resources follow versions<br>so if China is weird tap it up who needs<br>to go

strong number 3 he's a very vocal<br>student and he could not sit still at<br>school he was very hyper in class and<br>his teachers here he always had a lot of<br>potential but he always district that<br>his peers it's fair to say that Bronson<br>was the typical class clown Bronson soon<br>realized that he needed to make a change<br>in his life and he decided to take up<br>and offered<br>rugby and North America France has been<br>a couple of years overseas before he got<br>the cut from the team and he returned to<br>New Zealand began working for Fonterra<br>the botulism scare a few years

forgot<br>to say true oh yeah haha see that<br>handsome face funny how that works out<br>for some reason that's not how I thought<br>I wrote that down on a piece of paper<br>but thanks Amy as big nose this is<br>Christopher hailing from the bestest<br>sannyas babe New Zealand Hawke's Bay is<br>only one vein there's by your plenty<br>young he descends from a long list of<br>fierce naughty colors ooh warriors some<br>of us earliest achievements include a<br>perfect eighth week attendance and<br>detention during primary school<br>and a whopping ninety second place at<br>was cross country event that year we had<br>to say there's only 92 contestants it<br>was clear to say that he was not the<br>sharpest tool in the shed but Chris was<br>clearly a master of talent and skill in<br>high school he sharpened up and because<br>of this he became a prefect in his final<br>year seeing the value of education and<br>his job I'm sorry after this he he went<br>and done his mission for two years in<br>Utah Chris there's a woman um I'm gonna<br>say beware because for the last two<br>years he's been trying to get me going<br>over the chair it's a bit of a girl but<br>we'll see what goes after his mission he<br>could move back to Australia we worked<br>for a recruitment company and then he<br>soon realized that each case was really<br>important and not gonna lie it actually<br>is a little bit important open source<br>for you from there he decided that he<br>need to come back to New Zealand to<br>study and enrolled in a massage therapy<br>course and his girlfriend now wife so<br>give him the uppercut said you are not<br>doing that your hands are not going well<br>over the place he is obviously starting<br>the same as I am a BMS of others I'm H&amp;E<br>versus and strategic management and has<br>a desire to work for himself he doesn't<br>want to work for a big corporation so<br>ladies and gentleman please put your<br>can we get another round of applause for<br>Hawke's Bay please running joke between<br>me and Bronson we always teach teach<br>each other would bail where we're from<br>and where we've been but you'll see<br>throughout today I guess have our<br>stories at howard leight sequela<br>intertwined so sure how entrepreneurship<br>journey started the swine's whistling on<br>bunch of entrepreneurships<br>entrepreneurship to me started from a<br>young age my father was actually an<br>artist so he worked as a laborer a<br>factory worker at the same time he<br>airbrushed murals screen printed designs<br>has quite passionate about art but<br>because art doesn't really pay the bills<br>here to take another work but seen this<br>example through life I saw have Hills be<br>able to transfer ideas or I guess skills<br>and to money so I always had big dreams<br>grow enough now I want it to be in the<br>winter I want to create new things I<br>wanted to be somebody that had these<br>really big ideas and could make money<br>from it closely melissa is probably as<br>far as i got when i was a kid about<br>growing up through that stage you know I<br>had that little ideas with my friends my<br>cousin's start up my own little like<br>you're mowing business got my auntie's<br>bonds for twenty bucks come back the<br>next day and moment again okie paint<br>entrepreneurship for me was I guess<br>something that's always been upon me but<br>it has a bent over the last few years<br>where I've actually been able to try and<br>channel into or Harlan's when I guess<br>yes mi on entrepreneurship journey took<br>a little bit of different routes I<br>wasn't there in a bed of when I was<br>young<br>was and their creative and imaginative<br>entrepreneurship for me and you really<br>started the last couple about five or so<br>years I never really understood what the<br>word entrepreneurship really meant and I<br>kind of still don't understand what it<br>means today to be honest all I know is I<br>was passionate about money but I was<br>even more passionate about spending<br>money so I have to quickly come up with<br>a way to try and counteract my bad<br>spending habits because I wanted to<br>spend a lot of money on all these wants<br>that I pulled needs so I a couple years<br>back I took into the illness 48 business<br>startup competition and it just opened a<br>whole new world to me so I'm I was<br>surrounded by like a bunch of<br>like-minded people we all got together<br>and growing up all those totals a big<br>dreamer you're a dream while you're<br>never going to do then you've got your<br>heads in the clouds 24-7 come back down<br>to reality but when I entered into this<br>competition I surrounded myself with so<br>much other people there they didn't say<br>that they said to me that's a great idea<br>Bronson it's not going to work but it's<br>a great idea so what I'm get at us they<br>encouraged me and so from then onwards<br>like yeah I like these guys I like this<br>I don't want to go and work at a job<br>from Monday to Friday 925 and take<br>orders from a old man then I don't<br>actually like so I was like I need to<br>find a new route and I'm so lucky I fell<br>into this entrepreneurship net and for<br>me it's just I've never looked back<br>really it was cool because they were all<br>just as crazy as me they'll just as<br>hyper as me and they were real embracing<br>and they were able to take some moldy<br>boy they had no idea what he was talking<br>about and start teaching them live new<br>little tricks so as our profession guys<br>we want to hopefully I'll share a little<br>bit of those insights into what else our<br>journey has been like so you're probably<br>thinking like why am I still here<br>listening to these two dropkick to<br>haven't done anything mean with their<br>life or amazing now actually occur as I<br>need nice things you know why am i less<br>antenna is probably like the reason we<br>thought you guys were said probably<br>because the keys presentation was first<br>and too slow to get up the door doesn't<br>it off<br>hopefully throughout the presentation<br>you'll get to see a bit more about the<br>passion that comes from the work that<br>mean rocks that are doing so I'm sure<br>onto the lipo starter at both members<br>it's unlikely that the management school<br>shooter never that we talked about<br>myself I'm currently on the board for<br>that group or for this law boo and I'm a<br>nameless at how all these students had<br>you and especially in the business and<br>management loves to come from first<br>years all the way through to fourth<br>years in graduate that's our whole goal<br>strengthen up love support whatever we<br>can do to help these students pass<br>that's what we're here for so the only<br>luck it was a big has been play the big<br>importance for me this year not so much<br>my first years because i was quite shy<br>them at use of these resources but for<br>this year definitely been a big part of<br>my life um just want to add on to that<br>TRN i'm not the only support system that<br>you here so in like I saw University and<br>a lot of other student be armed Union<br>groups that you can also join and I just<br>so highly encourage you to jump on it<br>because when you meet new people you<br>step into new places it's just the same<br>cliche more people you know the better<br>of us so here jump on board on the<br>university have a lot of resources that<br>we've really support helping with and<br>we're going to touch more on that just a<br>little bit later on as well on how they<br>help to support us so telling me no coup<br>yep cheppu so I call this one a a couple<br>years ago turnin up cause hearing was<br>one of the groups that took out the<br>illest wouldn't business startup<br>challenge for those of you who don't<br>know what that competition is about<br>basically you're you make a group and<br>your group has given 48 hours to come up<br>with the business and then their<br>business sorry and their competition in<br>about market validation finance and<br>accounting and you learn how to Petra<br>how to ask investors for money this is a<br>picture of Albert the guy had the<br>beekeeping suitors Jonna at the back<br>here's a part of our team and also been<br>he was the person that I guess he had<br>the biggest load he was the one that<br>pitched for us but and this competition<br>tre took about a couple years ago and<br>last year both brought to<br>were participants in that we were in<br>through different teams but I think<br>because we both had a friend that he<br>went through and he won will I all he<br>can do i'm not going to say his name<br>because my knob but if he can do it then<br>definitely we can do it so happy guess<br>what i can to hear anyone what position<br>that i came that year like we were like<br>at the top it was like eight teams we<br>came hate the place so for me I need a<br>Redemption coming into this year's<br>competition that's the same for me the<br>team that I think my team came second in<br>second last and we actually lost to a<br>group that created a potato pot pie<br>business so i think was like Potato hot<br>ones that we needed that vengeance as<br>well so this was the last year the way<br>it works is at the top six things you<br>you go through this workshop and there's<br>48 hour process and you give all these I<br>guess exec summaries and little<br>checkpoints on how your business will do<br>over there for an hour period the group<br>takes the top six teams and at the top<br>six teams you get to pitch for the grand<br>prize which is $50,000 guess how weather<br>this year anybody all at once by that<br>lost again and you can see all of those<br>faces on the screen this appointment now<br>where we really thought we had a really<br>good idea so in that competition the guy<br>that meant keeping suit John here's a<br>hobbyist beekeeper one of those passions<br>is beekeeping and he thought of a way<br>which is what our business flows on<br>today of how we can meet the beekeeping<br>process more faster more efficient and<br>how we can make it easier for beekeepers<br>so going on so we thought you know we're<br>going to tear this up we looked at the<br>other groups and not you're not good we<br>really thought we had a chance but then<br>we'll be going to that stage remember at<br>the start I'm gonna stab verson this is<br>exactly what we were going through and<br>that's been one of the pledges learnings<br>that we've had so far is this one of<br>them even though we didn't win we learnt<br>a lot of things about entrepreneurship<br>so we call it like I'm learning that's<br>called failed learning so don't be<br>scared to fail so we'll just go out<br>there none Fred that be all but we'll<br>get this sunday then we ended up losing<br>that year to a group of other way cooler<br>uni students who creates it i think it<br>was like compressed air and it can be so<br>if you're in China you can bring new<br>zealand here that actually they're<br>pretty good very really weaker yep so in<br>this or the end that took us to the<br>field those innovations from to josiah<br>a-10s a couple people shoulder temper<br>sat in on you guys your idea be really<br>good to int into the field days<br>competition where same process there's a<br>whole bunch of people trying to get<br>investors trying to get their you know<br>their mohel with their product to the<br>market and so this was a stat field<br>eight guy in the middle is next right up<br>he's a comedian one of the funniest<br>people you could probably meet including<br>much tore us apart and the most funniest<br>way ever so I'm meeting new people like<br>that head just think differently there's<br>always good because they you could have<br>the dumbest idea but you'll make it<br>like yet the best dumbest idea and to me<br>that's like cool first thumbless idea in<br>the world I'll take that most field day<br>so i want to mention that we're all<br>students with broke we got no money we<br>got no resources they kept them there<br>nothing so we didn't have a stand we<br>don't have a table with the neb cheers<br>get even a host of viet nothing so<br>because we've christened on and everyone<br>else in the group and we're all<br>university students we were able to<br>leverage off the universe we were able<br>to ask him or bit of help so they gave<br>us a table to work on they gave us some<br>oh can we get up posters i think we bust<br>for that it's been a week bus for those<br>and we just came up with the whole<br>people ways that we could utilize the<br>university's resources and say that this<br>was our business for example when we<br>have business meetings holy / business<br>people will i if so come down to meet<br>you guys where's your guys office and<br>we're like almost universally sign<br>address again so the computer labs are<br>our business offices so this competition<br>um we were put into the grassroots oh<br>it's coming the business before the<br>business and in before their business<br>where you're like really basically you<br>just got an idea but to be a part of it<br>you need to have a prototype and so our<br>idea basically is and it's 48 we decided<br>that we were going to create artificial<br>honeycomb using 3d printers so we're go<br>3d print all this honeycomb we're going<br>to save bees wasting all this Honey to<br>make it and beekeepers would be able to<br>sound more handy because of it so well I<br>oh man when he need a prototype made us<br>look at some and draw these hands<br>they're black and the other thing that's<br>how many comments out of frame so i<br>think you know when you get a prototype<br>just to be able to be a palace<br>competitor so that thing's the day<br>before we managed to sort better if you<br>push the button on the right EDS our<br>product by woody it looks cool but it<br>really wasn't a good later award and<br>basically we had the sky that he<br>basically do like a whole ton of holes<br>in this piece of wood<br>look like honeycomb and there was our<br>prototype they got us through the<br>competition but that was what guys into<br>it there are we had those cheap one<br>hundred dollar piece of prototype and<br>we're out there asking investors for<br>half a million dollars from a hundred<br>dollar prototype so we dream big we're<br>big dreamers or cursors but I'm a real<br>asleep but what I'm getting at is we<br>don't have all the resources or capitals<br>that we want it or be needed but we're<br>slowly getting there we're building it<br>up step by step and now we've got a<br>whole in context to actually want to<br>work with us so we're not chasing me<br>anymore which is good by even that big<br>heavy suit there in the picture sarah<br>has old she was the only one that could<br>foot was about maybe this whole maybe<br>that why you just have to make it work<br>well I process it a lot came out of<br>field days wherever they put into<br>context with manufacturers bioplastic<br>manufacturers a lot of companies and<br>investors that want to work with us or<br>buy from us in the future it was a<br>really good event but however from field<br>days yep next one chair came a lot of<br>publicity impressed so if you see at<br>this photo some of you may see us have<br>you may not hear but Mia brought someone<br>with more Henry show talking about our<br>idea hey Bronson managed to the editor I<br>guess sweet-talk poor here insulating<br>and one of the hardest and then top<br>corner we are on breakfast and since<br>they live in quite a few newspaper<br>articles as one these are pretty much<br>the things where it can lead you tube<br>from just an idea because at the start<br>of our of our beds it was essentially<br>just an idea we still don't know where<br>the finish line is we think we're really<br>close to it but realistically we know<br>there's like a whole lot of mountains to<br>get in before we can get to that finish<br>line yeah so after field days once and i<br>got to the point where was like you know<br>we've generated a whole heap of<br>interests who are really good people are<br>throwing money at us faster than we can<br>catch it you know should we just stop<br>unique I the bus or in our last year and<br>we got to apply should we just quit uni<br>do this I mean in the future we don't<br>make it then we can make and finish our<br>degree or what should we do and so poor<br>lame at the back she's the militiamen<br>advisor monumental coordinator for the<br>one console management school she takes<br>care for them only students in because I<br>was issued at me and ransom effacing we<br>asked her you know this is me regret<br>this is what we're looking to do how can<br>we make what we want to do practically<br>work for us academically as well so if<br>you're through a few meetings we were<br>able to make that happen yes I was on my<br>mum was actually freaking after I told I<br>was going to finish University cuz i<br>hurting your bloody not like yeah I'm<br>going to push you this over this<br>business idea but like Chrissy after<br>these few meetings I was able to sit<br>down for fuse on lectures and talk to<br>them about what we want to do and now we<br>get to focus on our business full-time<br>and cross creditor academically so we do<br>our business full time as well as<br>getting out of the grease so um that's<br>definitely an option what I'm that's<br>what we're trying to say is if you have<br>an idea and you want to pursue it basalt<br>and don't give up on your degree because<br>like we said earlier education is still<br>important it's something that you can<br>fall back on and that's something that<br>Chris my folks so hugely grateful there<br>what couple university our King has 2<br>i'm with with us on that on that I'm<br>venture that we're following on right<br>now I think one of the main things that<br>we want to reiterate is dropping out of<br>uni isn't always the best solution and<br>sometimes it might take you having<br>another meeting or you're sending the<br>extra email to find out what can I do<br>how can I make it work that sort of<br>stuff and so for Bronson and I it's<br>worked out quite well the semester we<br>started our first South directed study<br>paper where a lot of the meetings and<br>stuff that we've been heaven because<br>even though we're full time students<br>we're actually still full time in this<br>business so yesterday Ron survey and a<br>couple others we arrived back from Paul<br>Merson law we had a meeting with the<br>business incubator for a great<br>startups basically there's a big fund of<br>money they picked eight top eight<br>companies and they inject ton of cash<br>into you and they mental you to help get<br>your idea to the market for us we made<br>it to the interview stage which was<br>yesterday we went to for uncivil<br>probably the toughest ten minutes of my<br>life Bronson's life as well and we're<br>really hammered by all these questions<br>but because we've had this opportunity<br>to focus full-time on where we are now<br>we were able to say question comes like<br>how are you going to make money give<br>them the answer how are you going to<br>supply products and materials we can<br>give them the answer because we've<br>actively been working on it at the same<br>time and so for us our journey has<br>worked out quite well if the university<br>getting behind us and helping us along<br>the way so here Bronson I want to talk<br>about the five things that we have<br>encountered that we think those of us<br>here that might you know there might be<br>a few day I think I've got the next<br>Facebook I but the next on an Instagram<br>these are what you could do or a point<br>that we made so that you can skip the<br>problems that we faced on our journey so<br>number one the first one that we<br>encountered was on product so with our<br>idea we thought product must be the<br>number one thing we must focus on a<br>platter you must make sure that is the<br>be-all end-all get it be all in so with<br>this we soon realize after a couple of<br>weeks that all our attention it will<br>focus in on what's completely wrong<br>because it's the customer that we should<br>be focusing on it's the Inca Shima the<br>people they're going to pay money for<br>your product so that was like one of our<br>first lessons that we learned a nun for<br>us we was like a why focus on the<br>customer we need to sell this bloody<br>thing we need to get our product LP so<br>it was like it was a big learning curve<br>for us and if you've got an idea we want<br>to say don't think about the product<br>think about who you're going to sell<br>to lose my fetchers off you and that's<br>how we came across a few days you know<br>with all that idea was going to say<br>beekeepers millions and some it actually<br>will but at this process will think you<br>know how I there's the best why do you<br>need anything else but then when we came<br>to feel those people like I actually<br>don't like them for that or that<br>wouldn't work in white higher there so<br>for us it was like a I caking maybe with<br>the Texas back to the drawing board so<br>putting the product first and the<br>customers last was a big mistake for us<br>and if you do have a product that you<br>want to sell keep the customers involved<br>which is what we're doing now number two<br>thinking there were no other competitors<br>sudden where I swivel-eyed where the<br>first people that had this there's a lot<br>of people they keep asking us you know<br>your idea why has it have been done<br>before why do people think of it earlier<br>and you know we think that's a good<br>question we don't know why they didn't<br>think of it earlier and we thought we<br>were the first ones to get there but<br>after doing some research my phone is<br>actually like or quite a handful of<br>people that are the same space but<br>different application or use so we've<br>learned that there are always<br>competitive and for us one of the big<br>ones was the traditional process a so we<br>thought if we create this new way for<br>beast to make honey that's the top but<br>really a competitor was that beekeepers<br>microchip that and that the current<br>process was a computer to us so we<br>always have to make sure this committee<br>we just thought we were the smartest<br>people in the world no one else had this<br>idea like us essentially and there was a<br>big role our third mistake was the<br>assumptions that we made we made so many<br>assumptions there like the first one was<br>we thought everyone we're gonna was<br>going to buy our product we said as soon<br>as we make those beekeepers gotta buy<br>this is going to fly off the shelves<br>we're going to be a millionaire within<br>the first month we soon came in to<br>realize that there was a big you're<br>dreaming believe so we have to make our<br>list of assumptions of things that we<br>thought were going to happen but we<br>actually didn't validate so that was<br>obviously number one there we're going<br>to make this product and then people are<br>going to say yeah I wanna<br>but we hadn't validated that because we<br>didn't actually asked a lot of customers<br>we ask we ask probably one or two and<br>they were our friends and when you think<br>your friend the guy stays yeah just the<br>realist ideal elbow you don't ask for it<br>so much I don't ice down because mum<br>will always do is really good you can<br>really check it in the rubbish solving a<br>solution before the problem and that's<br>why there are a lot of entrepreneurs<br>face or get caught up in as you think of<br>a really good idea in your thinking I<br>don't know it might be a mirror that<br>lights up in red green and blue and so<br>you've got this product that lights up a<br>red green and blue and you're thinking<br>that your ideas the big thing but is<br>there a real problem of somebody needs a<br>red light green light and the blue light<br>for us we had the solution of what we<br>thought was the big issue but we didn't<br>quite have the problem nailed down and<br>so forth for us we have to take a step<br>back again and we had to look at the<br>real problems that we're facing<br>beekeepers or beekeepers in this<br>industry was it really that beekeepers<br>one more honey or was it that they want<br>their beasts to stay alive longer order<br>that they want their hives to not weigh<br>as much there's a whole lot of problems<br>that you have to take a step back and<br>just analyzed before you jump straight<br>in yeah so if you've got an idea don't<br>have the idea think of a problem first<br>and then provide that solution to the<br>problem then you can slug in traction we<br>want the last one last one's been too<br>afraid I'm a very proud person so for me<br>telling someone that I've got this great<br>idea and they're not actually smashing<br>it everyone's going to turn around like<br>to my back if I'm going to be start<br>laughing au gratin city was the man in<br>look little diesel tip-off so like what<br>I'm getting is don't be too a pretty<br>scared jump off that cliff you know if<br>you want to go skydiving paycheck<br>skydive go get a bunch of bungee jump do<br>something gets out of your comfort zone<br>is what we're really trying to say<br>because entrepreneurship I have no idea<br>what<br>strippers but I'm doing something about<br>it I think I don't look you say it<br>earlier on to step forward as better<br>than those steps out all right so<br>something to look at and go back to the<br>flirting there Bronson was talking about<br>when we fail fast we actually realize<br>the problems quicker so it might be<br>there my red green and blue line mirror<br>the red light is too bright so because I<br>found that out early that saves me a<br>whole lot of issues in the future so<br>when we're not afraid to fail it<br>actually works out better in our<br>yeah so I think we have a practical so<br>I'm not too sure how much time we have<br>but we'll just keep goin till you're<br>kicked out um so we wanted to make it a<br>bit more practical and I guess take all<br>of you in the audience that might have<br>this dining idea that you might want to<br>get off your chest and bring to the<br>wheel and we'll try and help coach you<br>through what we've been through may be<br>happier on their process so there's<br>anybody here have an idea don't know job<br>it was just throw hand up anyone anyone<br>so what we'll do is what actually about<br>seven ish questions cuz we've got too<br>much time and then it'll hopefully get<br>you start thinking about any ideas that<br>you guys have and if you can kind of<br>like took those seven boxes you're<br>pretty much on to something and I'll<br>really suggest to do something about<br>that idea before someone else does it so<br>like the first question would be asking<br>us all so this is our lean canvas so<br>this is what a tool that we've been<br>given that we go through a lot and a lot<br>of other people go through you may have<br>seen it before you may not have seen<br>before but that's pretty effective and<br>once you work through it that it's<br>actually show some good great results<br>actually so my first question to you is<br>have you asked the people what they<br>think about your idea okay have you<br>asked a lot of people where be asked to<br>start a few people slick sure okay so<br>then you were the same brand as that's<br>koo asking our friends Leigh is it a<br>good idea we leave the case yeah yeah<br>that's the real idea so the first thing<br>we don't ask as many people as you can<br>and go to your targets so go to<br>kindergarten go to corners and ask those<br>type of people or actual appearance they<br>Cody because the other people that it's<br>going to be a by purchasing right so go<br>them ask them what they think about that<br>ideas are first it second one will go a<br>design is the idea of realistic like can<br>you actually make this product or<br>service so then if you're if you're yes<br>no or in between as long as you're not<br>on the no side then that's okay even if<br>you're between just keep working at it<br>the third one we have is I'm as a<br>solving an actual problem so ask<br>yourself is it a problem and if you want<br>her to think that there's a problem did<br>you go for it don't stop into it you<br>find your solution really i think it was<br>a problem because chris headlong here<br>when you as a little toddler and he went<br>through the same process the last one<br>will be on will people be willing to<br>purchase your product or service so will<br>they actually pull money out of the<br>pocket and give it to you for what<br>you're selling them a lot of people will<br>say<br>yeah yeah I'll purchase off you and then<br>go away three months later you bring<br>them back up hey I'm not this product do<br>you want it in your life ah much you<br>sure i have got my mind on top in this<br>week but low on cash and ya say tho<br>have your holder and excuses in reasons<br>but don't get in as ask them questions<br>like would you buy how much would you<br>proceed waffle and that's it and just<br>leave it at their then your body if you<br>do that thousand times or 100 times and<br>you've got 100 different and price<br>ranges or what your product is another<br>one is on competition we went through it<br>we said there is no competition out<br>there part when you actually go mirrors<br>corporate dishing out the head we got<br>seven billion people in this world I'm<br>sure one of those people will have come<br>up with an idea that is very similar or<br>exactly like what your idea is 61 is is<br>there a place in the market so look<br>around there's anything currently on the<br>table there's anything on the Shelf that<br>you can purchase and if there is what is<br>it and help different to them so i know<br>that you can get some head lice killers<br>spray sprays and stuff esa i mean just<br>look at what was available on the market<br>now and how unique your one's going to<br>be in the value proposition you're going<br>to provide your customers and if it's<br>above a hundred or you know above<br>landing your foot is stepping in the<br>right direction so just keep doing yep<br>yep<br>okay yeah yeah so that's all more the<br>marketing side of the sales side things<br>yeah yep yeah that's all good and then<br>it's the last one really is are you<br>passionate about it are you passionate<br>about solving that problem and if you<br>are really passionate about it you will<br>actually find the solution to their<br>problem I get a while working alone but<br>I still here on the board what would<br>break up for those of you like for your<br>idea or so for those of you then the<br>audience that might have your own idea<br>this is the leading campus we're hoping<br>to have something that's why cause I'm<br>not sure if we do but there's an auditor<br>way this works so you start with the<br>problem you find their customers and<br>then you find the solution in each of<br>you can go home tonight maybe just look<br>up lean campus on facebook or I mean<br>really sorry Tanya download it and then<br>just go through the process yourself<br>because if you can't make it to one two<br>three four five I think there's nine<br>squares all up there maybe just stop and<br>pepper or change where you're going or<br>ask their idea might be one that you<br>should laid to rest but this worksheet<br>helps us a lot and that's one that we<br>use quite often I guess to validate our<br>ideas and our business model so that's<br>pretty much the schools that were being<br>given and that concludes our<br>presentation<br>hey just another round of applause for<br>Ronson and crisply huh do 70 on part<br>I'll Christians for these two lovely<br>young lads anyone else officials for<br>obviously<br>essentially he's asking how do we get<br>over the shyness barrier that we as<br>moldy hay and Chris got on today<br>Christian has a great mission person<br>that is actually a really good question<br>and it's one that and some way shape<br>before we've all seen it in our lives<br>for myself like s brunson mention when I<br>went back to New Zealand from Australia<br>i enrolled in a massage therapy course<br>although this of course is easy i don't<br>have to worry about a degree student<br>loan it was really low risk to me but my<br>wife late kicked me out of that put me<br>into uni and when i started uni I picked<br>the business cuz I thought in my head<br>it's quite saves to be able to take a<br>corporate option being a counter and<br>working the council boom walk be a<br>logistics person and work and supply<br>chain I thought it was quite simple but<br>as I've gone through like you mentioned<br>these things that I guess little<br>barriers that subconsciously I knew of<br>because I always thought you know I've<br>never be the person that would be able<br>to ask them business for money or I'll<br>never be the person that would have<br>they're really good idea my ideas will<br>always be average I'm not sure for this<br>because that's how long the culture may<br>have been where I was raised Molly on<br>economic development and moldy<br>performance or I guess achievement<br>doesn't quite high in Hawke's Bay it's<br>actually quite low and so coming into<br>you and I think that was it was always<br>on my mind but I think what frontal will<br>agree it just comes down to the<br>accepting and opportunity and<br>you may never be the far though<br>obviously a lot fastest person in the<br>room but I'm fast enough to run so I<br>think for us it just comes down to the<br>point where if I believe in ourselves<br>and then just take a chance and then go<br>with it whatever happens Mars going to<br>be quite some of our most common kids<br>with their bit of innovation station<br>just across the road so that's where all<br>the Entrepreneurship happens not only<br>morally but every ethnicity if you've<br>got mighty just get over the talk to<br>somebody walk up to a scariest person<br>and introduce yourself because that<br>scariest person probably knows just<br>about everyone in the room walk up to<br>the smartest looking person here for we<br>know everyone in the room so just go and<br>meet someone and say hey my name is John<br>Smith and on King just get into<br>entrepreneurship Lion King skills<br>motivation and just that's what starts I<br>mean if you follow my review protract up<br>because I actually followed my nose<br>there was a meeting one day and they<br>said there it was free food so I<br>followed that sign in there and that's<br>how I ended up in entrepreneurship I met<br>a whole heap of people they were like<br>keen took an entrepreneurship and<br>eventually got those great ideals I hold<br>on to that now while eating on my burger<br>service today that's helped side of me<br>so just go to the base station and just<br>introduce yourself that's how i'm going<br>okay so we're quite limited on what we<br>can and can't say we thought we could<br>tell the warden everything about it but<br>we've been with some lawyers and some<br>patent attorneys that for us to be able<br>to protect it we can't go to detail<br>pretty much how to slip on my buns<br>because we would say a lot of things<br>that you shouldn't have been seen but we<br>can give you an overview so basically<br>the way that beekeepers produce honey is<br>it they allowed these to click this<br>honey and they store it at honeycomb if<br>the honeycombs aren't built the bees<br>will build it themselves and met process<br>is quite an efficient so it takes 10<br>kilos of honey to create one kilo of<br>beeswax so there's a lot of wasted honey<br>ICN share what we're trying to do is use<br>artificial honeycomb or create<br>artificial honeycomb so that the bees<br>don't have to make the handle that don't<br>have to waste the honey so beekeepers<br>have put these pre-drawn cones all these<br>frames that we produce becoming the only<br>job is to fill up the honey bee keeper<br>takes it out and house it faster<br>turnaround faster yields basically try<br>to make the v's a little smaller and<br>more focused but yes essentially oh I<br>just want to yeah going to walk away<br>with something today this was a motif<br>asking you to come up and do your do<br>their maje awesome bonus so I'm just<br>another part about the King entangled a<br>forms a fuse can write your name and<br>email address and number on them we're<br>going to be doing a drawer after the<br>second corridor that's going to be at<br>2pm here so afterwards is going to be a<br>chi and then it can come back at two<br>because I've got another amazing panel<br>that's going to get up and speak just<br>following T comma Modi I'm just going to<br>close our session with katekyo so John<br>my taco Capone capitol couture to have<br>to foil for taco re ki
