Tom Aurora from Ngati<br>Maniapoto<br>he's his sister as not well and she's<br>not looking at seen that we can say he's<br>a fine idea so we give his apologies<br>however kicked away<br>the path will unfold as we go so have to<br>pick up on a few things he was going to<br>talk about but he was going to introduce<br>our session so I'm going to have to do<br>that so you have to bear with me here<br>but can I have a show of hands can<br>anyone those if you are familiar with<br>this term or with this concept mana<br>you I would've been in unfamiliar with<br>from what we know from our research its<br>appears to be I guess the the wording<br>specific to not emoney important<br>but the idea the concept is Universal<br>around martyrdom so I'll just quickly<br>introduce that then I'll introduce our<br>so so what we're looking at today is we<br>acknowledge Singapore tomorrow myrtana<br>multicore cent of research excellence<br>stationed headquartered at Auckland<br>University but collaborating with a<br>whole bunch of our institutions and they<br>actually funded us for this project<br>we're going to talk about today<br>the project is project called - paper 30<br>what our code couple is about was<br>we're looking at all the Maori<br>organisations around the motto<br>42 defender of Maori Act trusts in the<br>narrative harmony model and trust era<br>under - to define our Maori raising any<br>guesses<br>okay good guess it's about 8,000<br>eight thousand chests so good all these<br>chests it's about five percent of the<br>land mass of New Zealand at 1.5 million<br>hectares most of the MER in the North<br>Island a huge concentration of them are<br>in the way out area so alko Papa for our<br>project was about looking at these Maori<br>organisations Keppler reports who done<br>recently<br>they looked at Maori land just smarty<br>assets and tell<br>there's a lot of assets there but<br>they're not performing as they could be<br>economically<br>so our thesis as it were was highly<br>enhanced Maori economic performance of<br>Maori organisations and<br>what we specifically looked at then our<br>project was collaboration your<br>aggregation that makes sense makes a<br>total business sense for<br>Maori organisations to come together and<br>work together to build scale so that<br>they're not duplicating services<br>so that they're not competing with each<br>other and so on and so forth and our<br>second presenter is going to elaborate<br>more on that but our code purple was how<br>do you get Maori organisations to<br>collaborate and to collaborate<br>effectively<br>so you think about that question and get<br>Maori organisations to come together for<br>certain projects now talk to you did we<br>do that traditionally what's the ste<br>colour<br>tikanga Maori did we work together and<br>collaborate for certain things certain<br>projects<br>if you're looking at tikanga there's<br>some grossly simplified tikanga values<br>and principles but one of them was<br>caught a little and mana protecting our<br>mana<br>rotating is very unity and collaboration<br>there are numerous historic examples of<br>this such as the king eaten<br>look at the Kingitanga officially<br>established in 1858 right but there was<br>a lot of work going in beforehand before<br>that but as you know in 1858 when the<br>Kingitanga was established what was the<br>main purpose or purposes of the King eat<br>or can you know and tell us<br>autonomy celebrating yes<br>yeah so called aji Tonga right unity hmm<br>so collaboration<br>bringing together there's also something<br>else about it too you don't remember the<br>other sort of main<br>stop the lane sales by 1860 most of the<br>land in the South Island had already<br>been sold<br>few passes were left and the North<br>Island land was already sold and a lot<br>of it in Auckland New Plymouth Hawke's<br>Bay Wellington so the land was<br>disappearing very fast and<br>the people of this earth we need to stop<br>those land sales one way to do that as<br>the king eating right we unite together<br>and also we place our land under the<br>manner of the king<br>that's what they did right and so that<br>did it wasn't that they gave over the<br>manor to the king but the land was going<br>to be protected as a trustee as it were<br>but that's an example of the tribes<br>coming together acknowledging it wasn't<br>all the tribes but I was a number of<br>them higher number of them<br>and<br>when they came together for the battle<br>of orakau<br>actually even before that remember the<br>Declaration of Independence up north<br>that was an example of collaboration to<br>the tribes up in the north all the way<br>down to here and actually Telugu was<br>part of it as well he signed up today<br>from Carmen so it's another example of<br>the tribes collaborating for<br>you didn't subscribe to the Kingitanga<br>3008 thing you're sort of over both<br>groups but there was another main<br>organization that was established<br>you know the member which one of us<br>that's right Parramatta Bali<br>put him at the Mariota heating her down<br>and white out up on one that was<br>established of upper house lower house<br>passing laws and so on but there was the<br>collaboration of the choice and actually<br>today we still collaborate we're still<br>fiercely tribal but one of the few times<br>you do really well in collaborating as<br>the right be right<br>there's not the sit-ins though hopefully<br>we'll get back to them anyway there's a<br>lot of historic examples of<br>collaboration okay now if we come to the<br>wars that were fought here<br>coming back to money flow to other room<br>so I'll go real fast and give my<br>colleagues some time here after the<br>Battle of waraqa was fought here and<br>Kiki and 2nd of April<br>bobby was drew from this area and the /<br>New River became a geopolitical boundary<br>and that was that the Hopa - don't put<br>the boundary and then what happened was<br>the Kingitanga and a lot of the tribes<br>south of this area they formed Ted or he<br>poor time and as you recall they don't<br>have full time from 1864 but who knew<br>became a geopolitical boundary and this<br>was actually the whole boundary was an<br>oak cutty hmm and as you recall an oak<br>cutty as a political border they can't<br>be crossed and this black boundary here<br>was the oak at the exit of the brown one<br>goes all the way down to Lake Taupo past<br>Oh murder Nui putted nearly he and I<br>went 20 miles out to sea - so they<br>actually didn't so that's general he<br>thought I that was a a type of state<br>within the state<br>and with respect from 1864 to 1889 no<br>Europeans were allowed in that area by<br>penalty of death<br>and the king and loved the tribes they<br>had soldiers patrolling all along this<br>area a<br>couple of missionaries and others tried<br>to cross that boundary and were executed<br>and cleaning John Whiteley quite today<br>and others<br>but that was a no petty that was total<br>he put a not well-known in New Zealand<br>history but they had their own laws<br>there in taxation system and trained<br>everything the strength of this rule he<br>pull tight what's the unity<br>how they stayed together and the held<br>off until 1889 what broke it up was<br>disunity so they collaborated together<br>work together and there was the strength<br>the native land cook and the railway<br>broke it up alright and so what the<br>political leaders at the time did was<br>they started playing the leaders off<br>against each other I won't say who was<br>the first one well who was once he gave<br>it but it broke up with the railway<br>going through the main trunk way from<br>but what Mommy did was said cough a<br>fight till D'Amato will keep fighting<br>for our rights<br>now so naughty man you put all the tribe<br>was part of that essential part of tdawg<br>you pull tight so they were united in<br>strong after the breakup of tittle he<br>puts a they were<br>separated and they were struggling as a<br>people in<br>1904 the money put two leaders and the<br>spirit of the past leaders particularly<br>these three and others they called a big<br>league at tomorrow we outside tickity<br>and 1904 to try and bring the tribe<br>together<br>and the whole cope up of the tribe was<br>unity of money patil and at the end of<br>it couple of days they came up with a KO<br>anata a covenant so it's just before New<br>Year's<br>it took them about three days to draft<br>it so quite quick it's all in Maori it's<br>quite beautiful too but the color matter<br>Ngati Maniapoto mio not happy that<br>starts off to bring the people together<br>they start off with the old motto go<br>through all the up up or down to<br>hooked it all down to<br>local radio who money a pull or vein out<br>to all the harpoon<br>so they do the up up a first which<br>is ticker and then they went through<br>that all here the different leaders and<br>someone to try and bring the tribes<br>together but an interesting term that<br>went right through the cow in utter as<br>this term mama lovely<br>so they referred to it a lot here Tom<br>Moore who's an expert translator of<br>Maori what he did we took her to see Tom<br>what does this term mean<br>Tom Sid from his translations is mana is<br>protecting individual collective protect<br>your mana but who do is a<br>blending of everyone's mana<br>so we protect and respect your mana but<br>for certain things same things we need<br>to come together and blend that money<br>and that's what this two means that's<br>where it comes from and that's what<br>nutty money ProTour are using today as<br>they start going into the treaty<br>settlements treaty settlement process<br>wonderful - well who do we need to blend<br>down below and come together right so<br>far no that's just a bit of background<br>to<br>our session this afternoon that's where<br>it comes from and being monofin oh it's<br>appropriate what we're going to do now<br>is<br>look at our project was how do you get<br>Maori organisations to blend together<br>for Peter purposes and our next<br>presenter as Jonathan killed Gao<br>not overdue and night Tagum he completed<br>a Bachelor of law here at workable and<br>then a masters of lawyers it didn't MBA<br>here's the trustee of a number of land<br>Trust's and he's currently working out<br>at hopefully with local and out college<br>among other places his own consulting<br>company too but he's part of our team<br>and he's going to talk to us about some<br>of the theory and frameworks for<br>collaboration<br>working in an<br>erotic<br>me Karthik chaotic what time I'll meet<br>the catapult in a coffin I<br>hear it in a nonlinear no no no Ngati<br>Maniapoto northern Idaho key Kapur he<br>hate him care about her eat America we<br>bring a new year Tarawa I mean no or no<br>data here to lure her so as as Robert<br>talked about I'm talking about<br>collaboration and more the theory in the<br>contemporary context so really talking<br>about the idea of collaborative<br>governance and for an ahmadi dynamic and<br>the way this was an element of the<br>project by tougher tougher T which we<br>which we undertook with Pacquiao<br>so the idea here really is about<br>collaboration amongst multiple existing<br>entities and across the Hylian hopparoo<br>ecosystem to deliver<br>suddenly of common purpose or common<br>strategy in the scenes as an<br>amalgamation which is more the formal<br>merging of organizations<br>collaboration instead being where the<br>organization's maintain the identity and<br>their daring manner but work together<br>for a full common purpose and so really<br>what I'm talking about is an<br>understanding of what collaborative<br>governance is<br>and also around the conditions and<br>processes that make collaboration<br>successful<br>so this diagram is kind of a<br>conceptualization of that Uehara<br>ecosystem of their space of the<br>organization's and prince within that<br>ecosystem so you have your traditional<br>leadership but in an organizational<br>sense you can have a number of different<br>organizations but different purposes<br>with different different shareholdings<br>and so forth and so you have the lights<br>of lunar trust boards / sediment<br>governance entities and multitude of<br>named trusts and some of these over mix<br>some of them don't and for example you<br>have in corporations which you can<br>bridge across eBay and hapu as well and<br>so the space is quite complex quite<br>quick and also when you also look at it<br>in terms of scale you have small trusts<br>you have large trusts and you have<br>collaborations outside of the helium hub<br>which space as well so the Sprint is a<br>number of companies dynamics when<br>talking about collaboration and their<br>space<br>and theorists have tried to plot<br>collaboration these are mentioning<br>theorists who try to plot collaboration<br>along a continuum and so down one end<br>which is that the turf end we have<br>organizations more in isolation and you<br>have dice and weigh together on the side<br>again that the trustee so collaboration<br>is more the trustee and but it isn't<br>quite amalgamation where the<br>organization is formally merged but this<br>type of scale helps to show how Trust is<br>a big component of collaboration their<br>organizations and leaders if people need<br>their sense of trust when they start<br>working together they're that into the<br>scale<br>in terms of motivations to collaborate<br>mainstream Western Theory talks largely<br>about six motivators so they came in to<br>improve efficiency performance share<br>resources or increase capacity but also<br>about leveraging power and preventing<br>strategic threats both through to pay<br>tougher T which we conducted over the<br>last two years we also looked at what<br>motivated people to collaboration and so<br>quite often they're pointed to a crisis<br>or to an opportunity<br>so of course the crisis motivates people<br>to actually change because these are<br>threats it is imminent an opportunity is<br>a bit harder because you have to sell<br>that opportunity and so building their<br>trust and commitment to that can be a<br>bit more complicated<br>we also looked at among all party I will<br>here the mod Economic Development Report<br>that Graham Smith in a statement of a<br>new era he did last year and so they<br>talked about collaboration is being<br>important to my economic development but<br>they separated into collaborations which<br>are more project specific and<br>relationships which are more enduring<br>but it will for my t-cog own values and<br>so they have created this this binary<br>between kind of manner conversations and<br>the relationships and the mahé<br>conversations in collaboration while we<br>agreed with us we also thought of it and<br>more of a continuum as well and so in<br>the middle you kind of have things which<br>are strategic our donation we deliver on<br>particularly outputs so in their<br>particular space you might find things<br>so mainstream theory essentially the<br>idea of collaborative governance as<br>multiple parties working together and a<br>deliberate scenes and a consensus based<br>way for common good or common goal<br>in terms of strategy and looks something<br>like this so of<br>making them tomorrow right you lived if<br>organizations aren't working together<br>they can be disorder competing purposes<br>crossing over and working it ends with<br>each other or slightly bill into in<br>isolation they may not be interfering<br>with each other space but they're not<br>necessarily delivering the same goal and<br>that's more an isolation of each other<br>whether the other end you're looking<br>more head working in collaboration which<br>can be working together towards a common<br>goal but not necessarily delivering the<br>most impact on there or like with us<br>collective impact spaces really agreeing<br>on the outcomes and trying to deliver on<br>that outcome well understanding each<br>organization's purpose perspective and<br>what they can deliver at least to<br>achieve the outcome<br>so the main which there's around<br>collective impact to have any people<br>here ahead of collective impact or<br>social impact<br>it kind of has a lot of currency at the<br>moment in the social entrepreneurship so<br>it comes out of Stanford essentially the<br>model is about finding the conditions<br>for collaboration to work across<br>multiple organizations on complex issues<br>the understanding with us is there<br>there's some issues there so complex<br>that no one organization can deliver an<br>effective outcome in respect of them so<br>instead of working in isolation that you<br>try and wait together and you come to an<br>agreement about what you're trying to<br>achieve and where everybody participates<br>in their process<br>I'm not going to go too much more to<br>that one but there's one model there's<br>out there the Ministry of Primary<br>Industries has also put out a model<br>that's a devil's put out on their<br>website about two months ago and while<br>they're provided is a similar type of<br>language but with the process the six<br>stage process for four trusts and farno<br>to start working together starting with<br>having cups of tea with each other which<br>was an important part of the process and<br>really building some momentum towards<br>something which is more formalized as a<br>collaboration<br>so if you put all those together and<br>some of the learnings especially from<br>Western theory but also some of the<br>things that we observed under poverty<br>some of the variables there that<br>influence the collaboration include<br>history and so for us as Marty we know<br>family that we work well together with<br>because of intergenerational connection<br>but also those that we find difficult to<br>work with for the same reasons so those<br>types of things can influence where the<br>collaboration takes place or not or some<br>of the things that you need to manage<br>around for collaboration really is about<br>finding the incentives to actually<br>participate together so again with<br>revisiting their point about crisis or<br>opportunity<br>understanding the power balance of the<br>dynamic is important you may have some<br>trusts who are who are really big and<br>perform really well but you have others<br>who don't have capacity to even engage<br>in the conversation so these dynamics<br>you have to work with as well through<br>our investigation was tippity we found<br>that leadership was really important so<br>collaborations take time to build it<br>takes many cups of tea over many years<br>to actually come to an agreement even to<br>move forward the so leadership can be<br>really important to collaboration<br>terms of critical factors really trust<br>in building commitment is really key to<br>to get India I put up there<br>lawyers kind of their process of coming<br>comfortable with each other and really<br>an<br>and I'll take oh we have ways of<br>building there so you know face to face<br>and so forth really what you're trying<br>to build is their shared understanding<br>of where you want to head<br>but their last point there is also<br>important about achieving those small<br>ones so with collaboration you don't<br>want to be two years down the track and<br>go about what you say because you've got<br>nothing to prove<br>moving forward so it is really important<br>to define it the outset what you're<br>trying to achieve and trying to create a<br>measurability around it so that you can<br>demonstrate the wins in collaboration<br>and also for those who don't participate<br>from the outset they can see the value<br>in potentially joining at a later stage<br>if they want to<br>another key point and I won't go into<br>all of these but federal purpose legal<br>form with those organizations at the<br>beginning they all have their own<br>constitution and own own purpose they<br>may not mention where you're heading<br>with the collaboration so as part of<br>being honest about whether you need a<br>new legal entity and they're in place or<br>in fact me that there is one there there<br>can take their mental but really you do<br>need the clear responsibilities and<br>wrongs<br>liberation as well<br>the last point around cultural match is<br>drawing from nation-building theory so<br>from the Harvard project and that's<br>really about understanding there there<br>are some principles which<br>and he ran through our tikanga they do<br>need to be evidence within a corporation<br>type governance model<br>so I'm thinking about all of us does<br>draw a lot on complexity theory<br>complexity theory as the idea there<br>things aren't necessarily linear things<br>are so dynamic that you need to take an<br>iterative approach so you have<br>information you trial it out you learn<br>and you adapt so when you put that<br>together and essentially add another<br>party of constantly evolving as you go<br>and learning and evolving as you as you<br>implement a model so for collaboration<br>starting off with one you know and<br>constantly moving and evaluating as you<br>move through the collaboration<br>so if you put together all this stuff<br>which I've just been rambling about he<br>end up with something like this<br>essentially is an iterative model so<br>that you constantly learn as you go as<br>you go through all these different parts<br>you start with a crisis or opportunity<br>and he wade through what you ate to<br>achieve as he will help organizations in<br>their space<br>you addressed form and so forth until<br>you developed basically an agenda to<br>work together and mutually reinforcing<br>actions as a collective within their<br>email hopparoo space again phenology<br>they trust and commitment in the<br>communication is really vital to think<br>this is really just reiterating one on<br>what I've said padam for collaboration<br>is not just about the the process of<br>collaborating and so just having<br>mechanical steps as in the sole thing<br>that you need in building a<br>collaboration you do need to have those<br>conditions there help collaboration to<br>grow as an adaptive process so you learn<br>as you move we do need to demonstrate<br>that there are our wins on the waste of<br>it working together the investment the<br>timer you put on it shows us benefit of<br>value but ultimately it is about manner<br>and about the map but also the<br>so<br>in the comics<br>yeah I think there's important<br>collaborations and sometimes<br>collaboration is really just a tool to<br>achieve a further outcome that you're<br>trying to get to and I think with<br>collaborations part of it is about<br>creating scale of improving capacity to<br>do things and so with Monica honey<br>working towards collaborative ventures<br>such as event but also involving the<br>ground is also important because of the<br>space that is for the benefit of the<br>people as much of us for our environment<br>as well<br>so I think there are multiple ways to<br>look in it but I think those are<br>important developments in this type of<br>space remembering that they are quite<br>often for particular purposes not just<br>you're right I see a lot more than<br>hit me via genuinely anyway in<br>comparison to the home of this place and<br>I think part of the reason is it's<br>non-threatening we all do care about the<br>environment so it's easier that people<br>to come together it's precious<br>I think you raise a good point one of<br>the things I'm really interested in is<br>how do you how do you shift that<br>commitment beyond just a few things that<br>let's see we're just finishing the<br>report fulness<br>hopefully be really by Monday next week<br>so it has all our key findings makes you<br>back to your question as part of our<br>research project we investigator<br>explored ten case studies<br>Tim taste studies of Maori organisations<br>and a couple of non-mothers innovations<br>collaborating aggregating coming<br>together<br>that included V Tucker the market theory<br>company requests tow cokes<br>14 trust that you equip the partnership<br>which is<br>16<br>but II we fisheries companies coming<br>together to build scale as well as the<br>rule 50 15 other pieces one of those<br>trustees involvement number of trust<br>aggregated belief and so on and so forth<br>so those are our main case studies and<br>over to our criteria all these case<br>studies were they were at least had a<br>bit of time<br>5 at least 5 15 years behind about some<br>measure how well they've been doing<br>they've been performing well<br>economically<br>we had a few other criteria but we were<br>looking at some actual case studies so<br>that we could test a theory test their<br>framework and then their next presenters<br>trying to apply the male was an actual<br>I<br>think they kind of relates to the last<br>question as well as their we quite often<br>look at the process in terms of we form<br>an agreement we do animo you and then<br>and so forth but a lot of it<br>behind-the-scenes tour is actually the<br>conversations and having building their<br>trust in over amount of time so it's<br>their type of element to but their<br>conditions to build it and the<br>Deaconess s chiller mentioned with warm<br>at least and look at seated took a lot<br>of time something to come together<br>bringing them so you can get the<br>conditions for they might case we agree<br>now we've sorted everything else but as<br>I alluded to in my opening remarks<br>Ivanovitch keep at it is acknowledging<br>the manner of these groups and then how<br>do we get them protect the Amana but to<br>the case that is really looked at they<br>did<br>TK was a fundamental part of all the<br>market case studies me amazingly<br>constitutions and the price this is how<br>they operate<br>I ain't here to some of them they were<br>collaborating with Mari organizations<br>they are also collaborating with non<br>Marty organizations -<br>so respecting its face Bob Marley and<br>Marley and how we collaborate then to<br>face it we come together to you but tea<br>yeah I think this be resolution needs to<br>be a part of it defenders a base top as<br>well I think coming to the agreement at<br>the beginning is actually building their<br>foundation till you're comfortable<br>mentoring together but also having a<br>process around the speech as well and I<br>kind of think of um there's a<br>collaboration over in British Columbia<br>in Canada at the moment and they have<br>been collaborating for probably about 15<br>years and had disputes over time but<br>kind of besides the common goal that<br>they're trying to achieve there's also<br>their dispute resolution that they know<br>they're going to disagree at some point<br>but how do you handle it<br>they're just heading<br>so we had some process for resolving<br>disputes there was open transparent and<br>supposedly fear<br>and that build set investor confidence<br>and the whole collaboration and I was<br>actually keep coming to of the Harvard<br>project<br>Indian economic development I can't take<br>deep politicized dispute resolution<br>they acknowledge that a lot of our<br>market government entities are<br>struggling this fact that's inevitable<br>you're going to have disputes that's<br>part of life this years how do you deal<br>with the<br>prepare for them that's why we have my<br>lawyers<br>better try to circumvent the lawyers<br>have been able to resolve their disputes<br>amongst ourselves at least first but<br>it's what's key to it as it's deep<br>politicized it's not subject to all that<br>tribal politics it's going with each<br>other sort that out what is challenging<br>now whether saying that were couple tiny<br>with the recent government's review have<br>been trying to do a step was saying he<br>says independence as you can get and<br>independent to speak resolution for<br>and so they tell you resolve the<br>differences of opinion regarding T gonna<br>I read adding a whole bunch of other<br>issues<br>and then there's a rather rather complex<br>question but um I<br>think<br>they will all have their because of<br>their dynamic see - they won't have a<br>different thing but I think some of the<br>ones that you've already drawn out I<br>because I think it really comes down to<br>what the causes as well - sometimes the<br>purpose of the collaboration can never<br>what's the whole purpose of the<br>collaboration<br>victimization<br>from some of the other C's research was<br>looking<br>for having friends it again and couple<br>of new info you what they look<br>ideally in the day but you turn creates<br>is a strong nation have your tribe be it<br>not too proud not too many applicants<br>River a strong nation which is healthy<br>educated<br>financially secure strong and each other<br>strong in video in all of those pictures<br>which is the vision of a lot of the<br>tribes<br>he is how do you achievement and as you<br>would have known for those who attended<br>the presentation this morning mr.<br>Bradley but what couple time you is<br>doing now is they're going into the<br>social social space under deals with<br>children and others which is really<br>important but it's not just and they<br>were going off her cope over here well<br>think just adding to that as well so<br>there the British Columbia collaboration<br>though I'm talking about they they<br>go through the collaboration they<br>knowledge the Mun of each of the<br>different groups that participate so<br>they can scale up and weave together<br>within to scale down and which is kind<br>of at the hopparoo level essentially<br>having their flexibility through<br>collaboration can help in knowledge that<br>manner rather than something like the<br>amalgamation where you kind of come<br>together and there are questions about<br>whether the identity of the other levels<br>do still exist so collaboration can<br>provide a mechanism to acknowledge the<br>person Elko Papa for this project was<br>met with some type of model to help them<br>collaborate to help them come to you<br>those dynamics those mechanics not the<br>purpose for its key but how do you<br>actually get<br>as I see it as part of our together it's<br>part of our history but it's actually a<br>challenge when it comes to do in<br>practice and so on that note silence<br>good lead-in to our next presenter<br>Carla he's from Seattle WA Knapp G<br>pikiao and we have to lucky look at a<br>said council on one Bay of Plenty<br>Regional Council he's just become just<br>those Rohit very dynamic in terms of the<br>leadership of his happy actually near<br>you<br>so he's one of the movers and shakers<br>actually she described me but with our<br>project honor we've been collaborating<br>or working with Nancy piquillo and we're<br>working closely with a tap it it has<br>been a privilege working with them to<br>Encino now pick our works and we're<br>coming into assisting with the<br>co-production of the smartness report<br>that's not us running at its world right<br>participating it didn't and the whole<br>first is together so on that note pass<br>didn't Up We're Robert he cannot go tell<br>more geeky more guitar by York Murray<br>hey wait no cut the of idiots<br>that's what a

feeling pretty tired<br>you fellows might be feeling pretty<br>tired so I'm gonna be a whole ha make<br>everyone stand up briefly do a little<br>bit of exercise before I never caught it<br>all hopefully then the ears or a book<br>will open and we're a little bit more<br>alive good boy so if you've got a pin<br>hold a pen in your hand if you don't<br>have a pancake the pie just put a finger<br>in there I want you to turn it around<br>clockwise<br>let's clockwise goodbye I hope you all<br>know what clockwise is I hate to think<br>about it all right keep turning it<br>clockwise and bring your finger down so<br>it's below your your face so you're down<br>here it have a look are you still tuning<br>clockwise<br>go so he doesn't stop tuning it anyway<br>but it's going a different way now that<br>it's down here a couple a kids sit down<br>does anyone know the moral to their<br>exercise<br>although the purpose of the exercise<br>rather than the moral and it's about<br>changing perspectives depending on how<br>we look at things we can see them from<br>from different perspectives I'm not sure<br>if that blends into the corridor I'm<br>gonna hear what just thought I needed a<br>bit of movement before I had a cord at<br>all but I'll try and weave it in somehow<br>I'll just give you a little bit of<br>background before I speak about this<br>particular project so my name's Donna I<br>I grew up at rotate C rotate sees a<br>small community just out of the door I'm<br>privileged to be brought up amongst my<br>farno live in an area where or the color<br>that I went to everybody was your cousin<br>so very much grew up within the midst of<br>my Kapoor my farno in very grassroots<br>very rural community very Maori<br>community I actually came to University<br>here when I was 18 or so I didn't really<br>know what I wanted to do when I leave<br>leave school and when I went to the<br>careers advisors they just throw up a<br>whole lot of options and I didn't really<br>know what I was about what I was<br>passionate about where I wanted to go<br>with my life so I thought management was<br>pretty generic if I do management I can<br>probably branch off into a whole lot of<br>different things of apply however and so<br>I did come here for<br>about six months<br>which probably tells either three they<br>did it why did continue with my<br>brother's business management degree but<br>I did it back through way to keep it in<br>the fedora<br>I<br>raised it because my initial interest<br>career-wise was around business<br>over time however it's become more so<br>about people about community and<br>particularly about habu and nearly but<br>how you integrate Maori values into the<br>way that we do business so that's what I<br>want to kind of talk quite a bit about<br>as I go through this the scope of our um<br>in just in terms of some of my<br>background and roles and how I know a<br>little bit about my real interests<br>probably for the last 10 years maybe 15<br>years I've been working with I was<br>mighty land trust of witless over a<br>hundred land trust throughout the Bay of<br>Plenty I worked for a period with<br>determine paid almighty trustee and that<br>gave me exposure to exposure to working<br>with my real interests right throughout<br>the Bay of Plenty prior to that it was<br>largely just within nights of the arrow<br>that I work with them and most of the<br>work that I do is around strategy<br>business planning and although we use<br>the term strategy and business planning<br>I don't really think it's about that<br>it's more so about<br>clarifying what it is that we really<br>want what's the purpose why do we exist<br>why do these lean trust exists what are<br>we trying to achieve for our people and<br>that's a really big focus for me and<br>that's where things like mana things<br>like our values of mod as Maori I'm big<br>on how do we integrate them into the<br>commercial world how do we take them<br>into the boardroom because over a decade<br>of working and advising Marty trusts<br>some of our practice and the boardroom<br>doesn't reflect that second layer cover<br>it doesn't reflect what you see on the<br>marae and in fact so I can't remember<br>the exact question but around models of<br>collaboration I often use the mirai is a<br>good example of when you look at them<br>awry and how their operates how things<br>work so smoothly what it is we can learn<br>from there to take into the boardroom in<br>a good example from for me as some or<br>not an example but a good learning for<br>me is the understanding of Co way in<br>seconds now and how that applies in the<br>boardrooms now I've got my own<br>understanding of color in chicken or<br>interpretation and it may differ from<br>others and petabyte dinner but what I<br>got taught was cover colour doesn't<br>change colour other cool values the core<br>principles that we operate by chikkanna<br>is the way that we choose to express<br>those values in chicken that can change<br>depending on the times of all the<br>circumstances and it's something that I<br>think the way I see us practice ticking<br>in other contexts outside of them are I<br>think we get wrong because we don't<br>understand the color property we don't<br>understand the underlying values that<br>drives it I'll come back to all of this<br>as I go through this the supported about<br>this particular project so you've<br>already heard a little bit about the<br>quite a few tea<br>this project we've been working on for<br>the last couple of years at least with<br>this group but it's something I've been<br>involved with for probably the last<br>decade something that my father had had<br>started he's now passed and in fact it<br>was there long before and it was really<br>about how does not seep Akio in terms of<br>our our land trust and different<br>different entities that we have how do<br>we better work together to achieve to<br>achieve our different aspirations so<br>FEA tippy-toe Fiji capita for come over<br>to patata Catina the whole purpose of<br>this was to explore the possibilities of<br>our future if we wear to work together<br>and then to think through how do we<br>and from an economic perspective this is<br>this was the rationale the hypothesis<br>the thinking was that if you can achieve<br>greater collaboration<br>you can if you can also achieve active<br>management and good governments then the<br>likelihood is that you'll be able to<br>either increase income decrease expenses<br>make more money and ever enhance<br>economic performance<br>that's a process to give better<br>economics that's not the purpose of the<br>copepod purpose of the co papa is to<br>give greater benefits to the people<br>economics as one ever knew for getting<br>there<br>just to put pickier land in context and<br>we're very fortunate within within<br>nights per year so for those of you who<br>don't know kind of we this is in the<br>country this is lake rotorua lake built<br>18 what they who in Bochum are<br>this is the row here of of knights<br>Pacquiao and you'll notice the little<br>star next to the United Cal context<br>it's also natural one way in not eat<br>Raphael growing up the we didn't<br>differentiate because the up upper<br>so close we will work together but then<br>when we get treaty settlements Tiffany<br>we want to pop up and and if they - oh<br>I've got to admonish that the various<br>see we anyway just some interesting<br>facts in terms of Mari land within 90<br>ppl we're fortunate that we we still<br>have about 90% of the land pre Europeans<br>coming the land that we within our<br>tribal here most of what we still have<br>in our ownership we didn't lose it<br>through dopa -<br>we didn't lose it through sales of the<br>land or not significant amounts anyway<br>and just to give you a bit of the the<br>context and the rationale for that one<br>was was good strategic thinking on some<br>of our leaders part but Tarawa as a<br>whole when Europeans started to to come<br>into algal here we were very clear at<br>their time anyway when you read the<br>history that we would never sell land<br>we're open to leasing it but would never<br>sell it<br>interestingly enough though over over<br>the years a lot of the we was in total<br>health lost their land or have sold<br>their land for whatever reason in our<br>case we were very lucky that we've had<br>on to 90 percent of it so there's 25,000<br>hectares of Marty land within the<br>pickleball here there's only fifty five<br>thousand hectares of Marty men in the<br>whole world or district so half of the<br>holder to the omadi land within the<br>littoral district half of it as was in<br>PL we're only one Neely of 13 Audie weed<br>with in parallel but it's a bit of a I<br>suppose a testament to our staunch nurse<br>around how how we hold onto our land in<br>in the importance of place in our lives<br>there were a few really smart strategies<br>in terms of different leaders over the<br>centuries that have helped us to to keep<br>this position<br>with no one as carol was known as coop<br>upper and some of the land walls that<br>we've we went with the the crown I don't<br>have an opinion about whether that was<br>right or wrong but I am very grateful<br>for the fact that we still have a lot of<br>our land and part of it is because of<br>that because we started with the crown<br>we didn't get that impacted but beyond<br>that we were also smart in the way that<br>we work with par care organisations so<br>I'm a councillor and one of my roles and<br>there's a lot of code governance<br>frameworks coming up nowadays we're we<br>set alongside councils to manage<br>different natural resources Natick pokeo<br>there's a new weeds we're doing this 100<br>years ago so<br>back in 1906 we set up a number of<br>scenic reserves the department of<br>conservation<br>the terms of those scenic reserves that<br>will sit on the governance and say so<br>we'll sit at the table to make the<br>decisions about how things happen so I<br>think in terms of blending the way we<br>work in working with others we've been<br>quite successful of that at that over<br>the time over time<br>the other thing that you you see where<br>the piggy I was the size of a Ewing so<br>there's these eight thousand people with<br>an HBO we've got 13 million around this<br>lake we've got probably the most<br>medieval with concentration on what I<br>throw all of Tarawa four lakes several<br>scenic reserves all of that Marty lend<br>382 land blocks make up all those those<br>Marty Len books<br>of that I'll skip business or some stats<br>on pl<br>of those 382 main blocks there's<br>probably only about 70 that are<br>economically active so there's a lot of<br>blocks that are just found a couple<br>kinda blocks loop our reservations my<br>reservations or other forms of<br>reservations<br>this is a bit boring about 382 now block<br>70 economically active there's one<br>hundred and fifty-five governance<br>structures so when you think about<br>trying a cabaret there's potentially a<br>hundred and fifty five different groups<br>to pull together to do that<br>one of the one of the reasons I wanted<br>to do this project is because within PDL<br>although we have a lot of land<br>not too many of our people are conscious<br>of that a conscious of our collective<br>scale in the strength of behave if we<br>will all work together better and so I<br>pulled together some of these numbers<br>largely for ourselves to get an<br>understanding of how big we are<br>listen these numbers relate to some<br>analysis I did on 11 of those 70<br>economically active trusts to make<br>things easier I just mean to the Livan<br>that I have up up or two because<br>I'm allowed the Iranian report so I can<br>use that information was easier than<br>trying to kick the whole civil tea but<br>it was very useful for this so out of<br>those who live in trusts two hundred<br>million dollars in assets 16 million in<br>revenue every year<br>13 million in<br>and after<br>sorry neat surplus so profit if you<br>looked at any one of these organizations<br>by themselves they don't have the scale<br>or all of them to do anything major to<br>have a huge impact but when you look at<br>us together we could make some huge<br>impacts on our people or for our people<br>this just gives you an idea of the<br>various assets that we have that we're<br>active with so where we are that we own<br>and we manage it because there's a lot<br>of its passive these are the ones that<br>are active so we have dairy farms I<br>wanna be though a lot of our dairy farms<br>actually out with an elder here we have<br>about two with a now looking down the<br>dairy farmers who bought outside of<br>little here you probably we're having a<br>debate at the moment about whether we<br>should be indiri at all because of the<br>the putti that it puts it into our water<br>the major asset was in Pinellas<br>fostering a lot of our land isn't isn't<br>that good for pastoral purposes quite a<br>lot of steep holy stuff<br>we're also fortunate that we sit on a<br>number of geothermal Springs so these<br>three geothermal areas or geothermal<br>power plants that are under exploration<br>phase or negotiation phase at the moment<br>and we also have some dry stock farms<br>one of the probably more interesting<br>economic assets that we have as<br>leasehold properties so within our door<br>here there's around two hundred police<br>soil properties that we have if any of<br>you have driven through Gotham are like<br>little ma pretty much every house along<br>that line is all still land that we own<br>and these are some of the pest services<br>one of the things I wanted to do in this<br>project was to have a look at where our<br>common expenditures because with those<br>70 economically active trusts we all pay<br>for our own stuff separately we all do<br>our own stuff we all have our own<br>accountants we'll be using the same<br>accountant but we don't have any<br>we haven't done any kind of clicked on<br>procurement and gone to these<br>accountants to sit with bringing you<br>city trusts you give us a bit of deal so<br>they've just picked us off one by one<br>and we all pay whatever we pay um so<br>here's a quick snapshot out of those<br>living trusts four hundred thousand<br>feeds on accounting and secretarial but<br>seen them 200,000 on various business<br>advisers forestry consultants farming<br>60k on insurance 50k on printing &amp;<br>stationery<br>yep we don't get together and say hey<br>let's get a bargain with the printers<br>let's get a bargain with the accountants<br>of the secrety riyals or even better<br>over time each establish our own<br>accounting and secretarial service we're<br>big enough we're spending enough money<br>and then this was distributions in the<br>particular year that I looked at so how<br>much money are we giving out and this is<br>a big co Papa for me there's one thing<br>to have a big balance sheet by big<br>balance sheets don't make a difference<br>in your people's homes<br>I'm interested in how much money you<br>actually getting out to farm oh and how<br>well are we doing and what are the<br>methods that were using to make a<br>difference so out of these 11 trusts<br>about 1.9 million was distributed and<br>this one particular year<br>across those various areas Yoshiko<br>matters the biggest of all of these 1<br>million dollars meets our co Martha<br>education in there Mariah and the one of<br>the interesting things and pikiao is we<br>we've got a lot of our our old values<br>that we practiced so the comb arts or<br>one was about looking after our old<br>people and you'll see 1 million half of<br>all of the distributions are going to<br>our pork in Elko max well I<br>support that from a value perspective<br>about respect your elders look after<br>your elders they've given so much to us<br>but strategically I don't know whether<br>it's the best thing for us to be doing<br>that we actually need to help all<br>generations not just Ana we need to<br>think about how we do that one of the<br>reasons in a<br>skeptical whales and say that's one of<br>the reasons a lot of trust like this one<br>is because you're voters you're<br>landowners<br>majority of them are over 65 so you give<br>good through Theo for Kamata chances are<br>you'll get in again but that's not a<br>reason that the photo<br>I'm just a few examples of collaboration<br>within Pacquiao I'm on the chair of<br>route 80 50 now blocks about 8,000<br>hippies out of that 24 Jesus would be<br>the biggest Marty lien blocking little<br>to a district that block was as a result<br>of an aggregation of 33 smaller blocks<br>in in terms of collaboration and why we<br>collaborate one of the biggest reasons<br>why Marty have collaborated historically<br>is out of crisis out of the fear of<br>losing something having to come together<br>to defend ourselves and that was very<br>much the reason why able to 18 which is<br>15 came together we're at the risk of<br>losing some of our land to the County<br>Borough of the council at a time for<br>unpaid rights in a lot of these small<br>blocks they weren't able to raise the<br>money they found it very hard to even<br>raise leases because some of the small<br>blocks were then locked and so forth so<br>back in 1971 this was the problem with<br>my Crowell was involved in all of us<br>we decided to bring those 33 smaller<br>blocks together and we list them to<br>Tesman which is a forestry Mullen<br>covered oh and that that basically gave<br>us the money to get rid of all of those<br>unpaid rates and to make us some money<br>into the future there are a number of<br>examples like that within pikiao so kpac<br>orchid incorporation a number of our<br>blocks were originally several small box<br>that came together<br>they do not all nights be on which is<br>one of the one of the earliest do not to<br>be established in the in the country in<br>the purpose there was to bring the girl<br>together to have an umbrella<br>organization that could support all of<br>the girls development there are also a<br>few business ventures and different<br>examples of next space that we've done<br>there's a collective of trust that<br>invest in property together I'm my trust<br>all good DG 15 rather is involved in the<br>geothermal collective so we're there are<br>three trusts on the border of our three<br>trust as a geothermal spring the<br>potential for power generation and we<br>work together again interesting<br>background to that it didn't start that<br>way it started all for each trust kind<br>of fighting with their with each other<br>in the various power companies to try<br>and get the best deal until we kind of<br>slept ourselves in the face and said hey<br>we're all cousins here what the hell are<br>we doing<br>you know I think I'm seeing a lot of<br>that with Miguel in fact I'm seeing it<br>across the board that there's more and<br>more of us realizing their competition<br>amongst ourselves just totally doesn't<br>make to make sense and that we need to<br>let go of some of the past I do because<br>we even within these phone and the<br>various family that I work with we've<br>got a star buddy but in my generation<br>we've said to each other wait'll dinner<br>not after we're done I mean there was<br>our father's generation there was our<br>growers generation it doesn't see how<br>people right now for us to continue this<br>Naruto<br>actually and a couple of other ones they<br>looked easy fifteen are involved in in<br>not even with the narrow new here so<br>we've done a JV with a small trust into<br>cookie to form a dairy farm over there<br>we were also involved in kiwifruit<br>orchards down and on Mayo in Toccoa it's<br>a big part of our strategy and I'll talk<br>a little bit about our strategy later on<br>in terms of this project and having the<br>corridor was PR trustees we wanted to<br>see what trustees thought with the key<br>opportunities of coming together and<br>these are the things that came out<br>and you'll probably find this amongst<br>any collective of land trusts so she had<br>accounting secretarial advisory services<br>a shared information platform shared<br>resources investments procurement<br>leveraging our influence<br>one of the things that we've never done<br>with councils for instance is<br>made them aware of the rates that we're<br>paying Cliff Lee I've done this I've<br>looked at the data for Tarawa<br>collectively Tarawa marty'll inbox<br>collectively contribute 2.5 million in<br>rates to our council every year but<br>we've never got together and use their<br>this is probably that the guts of it all<br>what are the challenges what are the<br>things that are holding us back you know<br>I think they're probably not peculiar<br>purely to Marty we'll see them a lot of<br>forms of collaboration entities mindsets<br>and perceptions this is is the biggest<br>one that I<br>suppose us odd to summarize that I'll<br>call it ego you know we get caught up<br>and all this is about me being the best<br>it's about my little passion and pgl<br>I've had this debate with my own<br>trustees around I just mission policy<br>and we give out a lot of money to<br>Komeito and I was challenging that one<br>for a number of reasons in one of the<br>arguments that came up was our year but<br>we with the only one that gives so much<br>to our kumara that's why we were held up<br>as one of the best trusts and you know<br>and I said how purpose is not to be<br>better than our neighbors our purpose is<br>to be better than we were yesterday and<br>to help your neighbors come with us for<br>them to be better not to compete<br>communication<br>whilst we communicate I don't think we<br>communicate about the right things and<br>that we go deep enough on their<br>communication the biggest issue for me<br>is leadership and when I look<br>historically at some of the things that<br>we did at the heart of all of those<br>things we have very strong leaders in<br>our past so the now blocked with TC 15<br>that amalgamation of 33 Lane blocks<br>there were 10 people at that meeting<br>there's 13 thousand donors in that block<br>but back in 71 10 people made the<br>decision and it was largely leaders<br>within our community<br>we need more of that leadership their<br>willingness to stand up to promote the<br>stuff to make it happen to overcome the<br>challenges I've been involved in a<br>number of attempts at collaboration and<br>people fall over as soon as stuff gets a<br>bit scary as soon as we start having a<br>bit of a flavor on the whole go home<br>forget about it that's not leadership<br>stay in the room work it out I don't<br>have all the answers and how to do it<br>but we require stronger leadership to<br>achieve it owner engagement and buying a<br>feel if we want to achieve collaboration<br>we need to take our units with it that's<br>why we're doing this assaults benefit<br>our owners and the Phinn were we need to<br>have the buy-in from them and I've seen<br>examples where owners have tried to turn<br>trust away from collaboration purely out<br>of the fear that they'll lose their<br>ownership rights they see it as off we<br>get lump them with them then I'll just<br>become one of that big group and I lose<br>my identity<br>trust these and really that's trustees<br>as leaders in the space and then<br>strategy one of the things that's really<br>missing within PEO is strategy we when<br>you have a corridor with picking our<br>trustees we all believe in collaboration<br>everyone's keen to do it<br>we don't have the strategies in place<br>and we're not taking the action down<br>that path in a lot of it comes back to<br>leadership<br>when we ask what are the critical<br>success factors right now to achieve<br>collaboration these are the three things<br>that came out understanding the click<br>the picture which I mentioned earlier a<br>lot of our trusts don't understand what<br>we look at look like when you look at us<br>typically getting a shared strategy in<br>having the buy-in across all of our<br>trusts with that in an intergenerational<br>leadership that we need strong leaders<br>and we need strong leaders not just for<br>today's time but also for tomorrow<br>I'll bring the specter I suppose a<br>practical example that I'm involved and<br>this is what easy 15 an overview of our<br>strategic direction and<br>the importance I suppose of tickler and<br>Kauai and marty values in the way that<br>we plan because a lot of our planning<br>started from that point and i'm i've<br>done i've been involved in a lot of<br>trust thinking about strategic plans<br>thinking about investment strategies and<br>i find a lot of it starts from the wrong<br>point largely because our advisors don't<br>understand the stuff in terms of our<br>vision and collective action wealth and<br>well-being what we want to see is not<br>only our trust being wealthy and having<br>wellbeing for our people we want to see<br>that collectively from our perspective<br>if we know that we can't make a big<br>enough impact for our people we've got<br>13,000 donors there's no way we're going<br>to be able to make a meaningful impact<br>for them on the flip side we know that<br>they also up up with to a lot of<br>the blocks around us so if we're working<br>together we can have greater impact we<br>need to do this collectively so right<br>from the outset we're putting it out<br>there actually sorry to put this in<br>context when I started on this trust<br>about six years ago<br>the vision was to be the leading<br>economic player in the central North<br>Island<br>annoyed what I don't really care about<br>being the leading economic player I care<br>about wealth and well-being and I care<br>about happening right across the board<br>so it's taken us some time to shift the<br>thinking within our trust to getting<br>something that's more authentic and more<br>linked to who we are as people<br>on the left-hand side bottom left inside<br>there as<br>our very strategic objectives so where<br>we focus our effort and and divide up<br>the various mahi that we do Cal took<br>with the boot so that's focused on<br>growing our assets and growing our cash<br>flow just a quick point about that no<br>point in growing assets if you can't<br>grow cash flow there's a lot of Marty<br>land trusts and entities that have great<br>balance sheets 100 million dollars on<br>there how much cash is flowing out of<br>there and how much cash is them flowing<br>on to the people<br>John Arthur that's about working<br>together developing strategic<br>partnerships working with our own<br>capital Ottawa making sure that we<br>distribute and vote so contributing to<br>our people culture and environment even<br>with this one we've changed the faqad or<br>a bit compared to what I've seen in some<br>trusts so some trust a lot of trust to<br>have some form of distribution policy<br>but a lot of the distribution the wealth<br>that they're giving out is focused on<br>giving it to the people to the owners<br>we've slightly changed it and said it's<br>about our people being our owners but<br>also border it's the communities the hub<br>food that they live in<br>it's about our culture and it's about<br>our environment so we now have a policy<br>where we don't only give money to<br>individuals we also give money to our<br>marae we give money for environmental<br>purposes in fact there's a trust we were<br>already giving my money to but I we we<br>give out we've got 12 Malloy that<br>affiliate to the spot they will get<br>$5,000 a year to do whatever for the<br>operational cost and so forth but we<br>also make available $50,000 a year for<br>any major upgrades that they need to do<br>on them what I so that's there's only<br>50,000 that's available to any one of<br>them they've gotta apply each year to to<br>get that and then finally Kapoor way<br>developing the capacity and capability<br>to deliver a vision and this is<br>something in the land trust space that<br>not many of our trusts are doing many of<br>our trusts only have a governance<br>structure in place all of the management<br>all the people doing may we're<br>contracting that out that's the<br>accountants secretarial services its<br>advisers and so forth our trust LM is to<br>have all of our own capacity in place so<br>we're not having to go buy at least<br>probably eighteen eighty percent<br>in-house it's going to take us time to<br>build that we're currently in the<br>process of recruiting a general manager<br>and we have an number of other<br>strategies that we're looking at with<br>other trusts around shared services so<br>forth because it's funny we talk a lot<br>about creating jobs within these trusts<br>and ironically we already create a whole<br>lot of jobs they're just not we don't<br>have no control over them we're paying<br>other people who then employ a whole lot<br>of other people so over time we want to<br>build their um the top right hand corner<br>there is our mission kaitiaki to bucola<br>to her and not argue that a really high<br>level that this is pretty much the same<br>mission for a lot of trust one is to<br>protect in the sense of protecting that<br>for the cultural sacredness of it<br>another part is about growing both in an<br>economic sense but in a whole lot of<br>other ways and in the final part is<br>around contribution then finally and<br>probably most importantly are our values<br>CAF a common additive a part that we<br>respect and value people<br>Catina the kaitiakitanga we act with<br>integrity Kotaku - were we value the<br>sacredness of land care to Maya we are<br>courageous and care not to hit the<br>Vacarro meter money we believe in<br>working together um it's a couple of<br>quick points on there the care to Maya<br>about being courageous one of the things<br>that we've seen in the spaces is a lack<br>of leadership a lack of willingness to<br>try things that are new a lack of<br>willingness to push through the barriers<br>that are before us and there's a trust<br>with we're trained trying our best to to<br>have courage in this space to do the<br>things that others sometimes are too<br>afraid to do<br>and just relating this stuff back to<br>distributions and what we give out to<br>our people<br>that 2015 gear doesn't look too good on<br>average it's only because a couple of<br>years got lumped together and 20 and 14<br>but on average we've given out around<br>about 500,000 a year to our people<br>through through these various forms so -<br>um rights without quirky or code marks<br>well to our community organizations so<br>we give money to the key community<br>organizations within our hero rugby<br>clubs League clubs our hunting clubs<br>because those are important parts of our<br>of our community and then we have the<br>discretionary space where we can give it<br>out for a whole lot of different Papa we<br>also have a bit of Education in there as<br>well but as a trust in having work with<br>a number of trusts we're probably one of<br>the better ones in terms of making sure<br>that our profits get out to all people<br>we give out 40% of our net profit every<br>year regardless of what it is so if it's<br>big it's bigger its small its small that<br>works both for the trust them for the<br>people because we share the the ups and<br>downs and but that 40 percent figure<br>having worked with a number of trusters<br>is quite high one of the ones that I've<br>worked with particularly the bigger ones<br>ironically tend to be smaller tend to be<br>around the team - it's a 20% and again<br>what argue there's no point in having a<br>big balance sheet if you're not getting<br>benefits out of fewer people<br>right so that's a bit about what do you<br>need 15 that's a bit about but you know<br>I just want to come back to the monopoly<br>in this blending of of<br>Maori mana Maori values in wisdom values<br>and the other things that we know from<br>the global world one of the things I<br>want to say first up was that I think<br>that Marty values should be the the<br>dominant drivers of our strategy when we<br>talk about where we're going and how<br>we're going to get there we should be<br>using our mighty values we should start<br>from that point in order to do that<br>however we we need to have a better<br>understanding and better practice of our<br>values like I said if you go to a mirai<br>you watch our thinking our operates how<br>smoothly things work we we don't seem to<br>be able to replicate that in economic<br>spaces and other spaces there is some<br>learning in that when you when you have<br>a look at what's on behind it why do we<br>have the commitment when it comes to and<br>what I why do we accept the various<br>roles that we have on our own and why<br>does it run so smoothly we need to take<br>those learnings and apply them in the<br>boardroom<br>the other thing that are done I'd say is<br>that we need to make chicken and koa<br>living living beyond ritual and protocol<br>so we often talk about chicken on color<br>but<br>we only really practice it within<br>certain rituals and protocols you see it<br>as a thing you see it in the Beaudry<br>when we start with the karakia and we<br>end with a cutter kill or die agree that<br>if you're true to your check on the<br>uncover these are values these are ways<br>of being you can't do it just over here<br>you just pull it out when you need to<br>know okay let's do the curricular you<br>need to be living by those values all<br>the time so if you believe in are over<br>you believe in manake coming up you<br>should be doing that wherever you are<br>not just when we hit the protocol for<br>them the ritual for it this stuff might<br>sound simple but that's my observation<br>we don't do it enough and unfortunately<br>we have some some leaders out there that<br>will put chicken coop in you this stuff<br>is really important but they don't<br>always practice it we need to be story<br>around it chicken on color isn't<br>something you roll out as a protocol or<br>ritual when you do it now and again it's<br>got to be part of your everyday life and<br>it can take many forms doesn't have to<br>be in the form of curricula for some of<br>us it's getting up early and doing<br>Cahokia but it's a it can be done in a<br>whole lot of different ways showing Otto<br>how it can be very simple can be being<br>appreciative of people can be giving<br>them a small we need to practice this<br>stuff in everything that we do a<br>couple mana I think we've got a<br>reinterpret while it's up to everyone to<br>interpret it however they they can but<br>my interpretation of mana when I compare<br>it to what you look at in the dictionary<br>so though if the common translation for<br>it is power and authority I'd argue that<br>that's not mana that's the outcome of<br>mana mana is responsibility how well you<br>exercise your responsibilities will<br>result in some form of mana or power and<br>authority and it won't even be you that<br>creates that it's the people that will<br>give you their money<br>that's simple shift in thinking because<br>I've worked around their own people who<br>are my hungry pets and it's about<br>getting the title it's about being the<br>person in the front for me it's about<br>doing or mahi well in doing it was good<br>intent<br>we need to explore these values and get<br>to understand them better and bring them<br>into life into the way that we do things<br>beyond our protocols in which Chicano<br>car wasn't just the place for than what<br>I it isn't just fall for things we'll be<br>doing the morale within Pokemon it's<br>something that we should be practicing<br>I'll leave it there that's been a little<br>bit random sorry far know I've been a<br>book crook lately is there any much time<br>to prepare I'm hopefully there were some<br>useful stuff on me but perhaps through<br>some questions and answers so you can<br>any disagreements because for tittles<br>good whether we agree or not the more we<br>caught it over these things the more<br>enlightened<br>there are some some strategies that are<br>emerging along those lines so one is<br>associate trusty ships so that are<br>specifically focused on but they so they<br>effectively come and sit alongside the<br>trustees do all the same ie as the<br>trustees as a way of letting them in and<br>giving them some learning another one<br>that our trusts quite interested in is<br>with education scholarships we give out<br>scholarships but there's no pathway for<br>our people to come back into either<br>internships or or jobs so we're thinking<br>hard about how do we create those jobs<br>now one of the ways that we're doing it<br>is taking all of the money that we've<br>already paying people and creating jobs<br>in trying to build it ourselves eg the<br>accounting service the secretarial<br>service do all of that ourselves that<br>way we've got the jobs to plug them back<br>in one other way that we do it is with<br>the business partners that we work with<br>so we work with a lot of big forestry<br>companies geothermal<br>yes sorry power companies whole range of<br>different companies with some of them<br>we're pushing them to set up internships<br>for our people to come back in that said<br>it's none of it's really rolling that<br>well yet but there needs to be their<br>focus of bringing out I gotta here<br>within my early within PEO in the last<br>ten years or so there's been a huge<br>shift in terms of younger generations<br>coming into the trustee space so and I'm<br>probably a bit of an anomaly compared to<br>a lot of the age groups of Trustees so<br>typically actually I did some work about<br>six years ago on Tarawa trust and we<br>looked at the median age of governor's<br>on our various entities the median age<br>was 64 I think it was<br>I'm 35 so I'm you know thirty years too<br>early<br>but I'm seeing that across the board<br>within pikiao at least that we're<br>getting a lot more of our younger<br>generations coming through but that's a<br>result of our older generation saying<br>actually we need to let go here we don't<br>have the right skill set we need to<br>bring our young people and there's a<br>real groundswell of debt happening with<br>and with mpgl and it's not just in this<br>trusty space that's happening in terms<br>Popoy but it's kind of taking a better<br>yeah I<br>think mix resulted a lot of them are too<br>early to talented in my opinion so in<br>terms of the Regional Planning Regional<br>Council<br>mostly our code governance arrangements<br>have only been operating for three or<br>four years I have personally I think<br>there there are certain ways they've<br>already added value now one is changing<br>the perception of natural resource<br>management you Marty have a very<br>different perspective on how we think<br>about our our in our Moana and now a<br>heady and so forth and one of the simple<br>ones is that they're part of our<br>apart if you understand the up I'll<br>go back to Ronnie Nui our land our our<br>moment they all came before us but we're<br>all linked we're all part of that<br>so I think now Martha oh no Marty now<br>our ways of thinking is having an impact<br>on councils around thinking differently<br>the challenge that we're going through<br>at the moment is is how to integrate<br>that with science and law because that<br>at the end of the day they tell councils<br>work it's about regulation it's about<br>science and Pyrrhic on evidence to say<br>yes we should do this and what not a<br>good example that of one area where<br>we're starting to do that is 90 mark you<br>know they've done some work around the<br>flow levels of way Tahari River and<br>what they've done is they've had people<br>go out and observe the river at certain<br>times and noted their views on whether<br>the MODY of the river was a and out of<br>one to ten do you think it's healthy do<br>you think it's it's potent and so forth<br>and then they've married that up against<br>the science starter at the same time to<br>see what what does the actual data say<br>at the same time that we feel that<br>things are right so that's starting to<br>bring the two together and ironically<br>there's a whole lot of similarities the<br>other thing we've done more so on the<br>third on a mourner side of things we've<br>so we have Chris better Shaw who's a<br>professor from Waco<br>he's he's based down in Toronto who<br>works with our council and a whole lot<br>of Environmental Management thinks he<br>works closely with a number of Yui<br>people and he's he's probably the best<br>person to talk to in terms of a partier<br>who understands science really well in<br>the value of Maradona Marty a simple<br>example that I can think of as<br>the Rena disaster in in terms of where<br>they expected pollution to tune up there<br>was was the Ho Chi Minh was the people<br>from there that said to them this is<br>where we're going to start seeing<br>problems because they understood the way<br>that the sea moves when the Seas going<br>this way to me up to me and he said that<br>was hugely helpful for them they were<br>able to pinpoint areas and get there<br>quicker so you know I think it's pretty<br>exciting times over the next we wall as<br>we learn how to both ascend Parker I<br>learn how to integrate our knowledge<br>with their knowledge because I think<br>there's some real value in our stuff<br>just as much as IRA's in science and in<br>the Western world um just another Copa<br>Beau's probably a better capable for me<br>to talk about in terms of collaboration<br>the Tarawa partnership so that's a<br>recent development in terms of towers<br>relationship with little Toro Lakes<br>Council that we developed over the last<br>a year or so but within that whole<br>process was really a process of<br>collaboration amongst our WA to get us<br>to agree on the model and then come<br>together<br>to form a partnership with the council<br>and there's a few things within that o<br>that I think is relevant to some of the<br>questions that have come up today that<br>I'm not that he won so within this board<br>that we've created two reviews with the<br>council these forty members to of the<br>America thing there aren't any other<br>Tarawa entities that have run at the<br>spots for Amata he was guaranteed we<br>made sure that it was a space for them<br>there was also a different construct and<br>how we made up their membership so<br>typically it's kind of an at-large if<br>you're from Tarawa you Ernie we changed<br>that we said two seats of these fourteen<br>will go to 94 Kohli the reason for that<br>was 94 Kovac gifted the lane to Crete<br>the township of dr. Lewis I was<br>acknowledging our history the important<br>part that 94 Kobe played and the<br>establishment of Rotorua respecting my<br>suppose now demonize opposed to Parker<br>at the mock receive mana which might say<br>make it at large and make it fair for<br>everybody<br>we had another space it was six at large<br>seats for anyone from Tarawa we had two<br>seats that were specifically for our<br>interests so that we had that voice<br>coming into the into the<br>we hit another seat that was<br>specifically for our Komatsu<br>so creating these new models that align<br>better was the way that we sync with our<br>natural structures part of that however<br>requires some debate amongst ourselves<br>about our own understanding of ourselves<br>to be quite frank I think some of our<br>folk are all about who we are but we whe<br>wawa from we we those Vacarro originally<br>came from and it's not for me to say<br>this is how it should be for anyone<br>that's where every how proof are no two<br>to work it out themselves but am i<br>experiencing of seeing we twist some of<br>that's a huge area that needs more focus<br>and we need to do exactly that so one of<br>the actions for our trusts and the next<br>year is to do a piece of research around<br>understanding I suppose and partly<br>observes the social impact of the money<br>that we're giving out on the cultural<br>impact your your bang on your home<br>because if you look at it the way that a<br>lot of our trust gives money out we're<br>kind of all doing the same old same old<br>leave some scholarships give some money<br>to the bride but what real benefit is<br>that making now one of the reasons I<br>keep asking myself this question is I've<br>grown up a model here and I still live<br>there today in there aren't the people<br>it just population-wise there's not as<br>many people they live in out here<br>anymore you know I was a kid yeah our<br>school rolls 44 now it was 120 when I<br>was a kid<br>why is it that even though economically<br>we're doing pretty well why is it that<br>all our people have to go and get jobs<br>in Australia why is it that we the ones<br>that are left here are a lot of them are<br>struggling these are must Mitch I've<br>seen I don't know the empirical data but<br>there's a graph that basically looks one<br>line going like this another line going<br>like this this line is the Marty economy<br>it's grown this line is Marty well-being<br>it's maybe flat probably slightly going<br>backwards there's an issue here finally<br>no point making lots of money if there<br>people still pull her own in their<br>hearts I don't care about we don't have<br>to be rich money-wise but we should be<br>wealthy in terms of being happy in terms<br>of knowing who we are so<br>so<br>anyone who hears the answers or who<br>wants to look at their question or work<br>on it I think that that's a critical<br>question for Marty over the next hundred<br>years because we're doing the economic<br>stuff but others of no value if it's not<br>going to change the well-being of our<br>people<br>that's a good place for us to finish<br>finally getting my staff passed just<br>speciation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
