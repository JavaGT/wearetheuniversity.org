accurate.</p><p>welcome to this session at um Kanga day<br>hosted by Tipper faculty of law my name<br>is Wayne rumbles I'm the dean of the law<br>faculty um I'm a white cow boy um grew<br>up in Pat under the shadow of mongal Tre<br>and um haven't so haven't moved too far<br>from home y i I took a little round trip<br>to get back here but um back here<br>eventually um so I've gone up here in<br>the in wut chinoi um<br>lands chinger The Faculty of law um has<br>a founding principle three founding<br>principles but the one I want to just<br>briefly talk about a bit now is our um<br>principle of uh giving a bicultural<br>legal<br>education<br>um this benefits not only our Mii<br>students but also our pakia students um<br>and to me it seems like it seems very<br>natural that um and common sense that to<br>understand your cultural historical<br>context of your present is the way that<br>you can move forward but back in 1991<br>when the school was formed um this was<br>seen as a radical idea and actually even<br>a dangerous<br>idea uh but my commitment to to the<br>university and to The Faculty um is to<br>ensure that we continue um This<br>bicultural legal Mission um in into our<br>25th<br>year<br>um and um I am committed to explore and<br>develop what uh bicultural legal<br>education means um in um 21st century<br>Aro in New<br>Zealand now it may be questionable that<br>um New Zealand needs more lawyers um but<br>what is is certain is that we need more<br>Marty<br>lawyers and um at tiing uh we have uh<br>30% of our cohort as Mari students and U<br>we want to ensure that we Remain the law<br>students um and this morning's um<br>keynote it it was mentioned that um we<br>need to move outside our comfort zone so<br>we can Co so pakia and Mari can coexist<br>um<br>so and it's the fear of the unknown um<br>that sets up barriers as the bricks and<br>the wall that separate um<br>peoples now it is unfortunate that<br>there're not more pakia here because I<br>think um you know these days and these<br>experiences are as important for pakia<br>as it is for for for for<br>Mii but you don't really want to hear me<br>talk about too much so I'll introduce<br>our speaker uh rahui Papa so rahui has<br>um representatives marai in the tribal<br>Parliament since Inception in<br>1999 and co-chairs the Nati cord um<br>kukura U tribal trust he has a<br>background in broadcasting and education<br>and chairs of several Community<br>organizations from kago to tribal and<br>Community trusts he sits on um e<br>governance groups he's an oror and<br>recognized Authority in wo and um TI he<br>is um po for our our own faculty T<br>faculty of Law and other tertiary and<br>corporate um groups um within the w we<br>are grateful for his contribution to the<br>faculty's program um for King Tanga day<br>which he has contributed to for many<br>years whilst um uh py um cfia McLean<br>former CEO cannot be with us today she's<br>recently taken up a new position with<br>nzta um uh rahu I'm sure we'll fill the<br>time um uh he's he's going to talk to us<br>today about umaki or Miki uh and in its<br>historic cont concept with the King<br>Tanga and um how that is reflected in um<br>today's um actions uh so I'll hand over<br>to rahu and I'm sure we'll have plenty<br>k<br>for<br>so uh probably more than half of you<br>would have been here because mle's name<br>was on the building as well<br>unfortunately well fortunately and<br>unfortunately P kafia left W otan as the<br>CEO recently to take up a position uh uh<br>High powerered position within uh the<br>New Zealand transport Authority uh and<br>has become the CEO of the wake or Bay of<br>Plenty uh for nzta uh and we wish her uh<br>extremely well our acting CEO was poised<br>to fill the spot uh Donna feville<br>unfortunately uh Donna suffered a family<br>bereavement her brother passing away uh<br>this week and so they're in the Hooka<br>and he gets led to rest today and so our<br>thoughts uh and our prayers are with<br>Donna<br>and uh and so uh so what you see is what<br>you<br>get one of the things that um I was<br>asked to talk about was um how uh does<br>wake or taining uh in all of its aspects<br>so King Tonga as well as the tribal<br>organization so um uh recently there was<br>a documentary a three-part documentary<br>uh on the king Tonga uh and uh lots of<br>it was about um sharing uh the ideas and<br>the principles of Kanga with the nation<br>in the hopes of raising uh awareness in<br>the hopes of uh clarifying or<br>demystifying a whole lot of aspects as<br>it relates to the K the K is a key part<br>and parcel of w t w has become uh and<br>from its Inception from the Inception of<br>the king W has become the guardian of<br>the K some people say you know too<br>strong so our uh uh there's no room for<br>anybody else uh but um essentially W has<br>become the fing uh for the king a<br>protective uh cloak if you like uh for<br>the concepts and the key principles of<br>King and so Kanga is reflected very very<br>strongly within the operations within<br>the<br>organization of w and our tribal<br>Parliament now<br>called<br>and is about looking back as well as<br>looking forward so the visions of the<br>past coupled with the visions of the<br>future uh should determine what we do in<br>the current uh for for wake up raining<br>and there's no greater symbol there's no<br>deik has become the standard the U the<br>code of arms if you like for the king<br>what I'm going to do is I'm going to<br>break down the key core components of<br>the Pik talking about uh their aspect<br>from a historical point of view as well<br>as a contemporary point of view uh and<br>how it is shaping some of the work<br>streams that Wan uh get involved with on<br>a day-to-day basis<br>so uh is a very sacred symbol within the<br>K the design itself uh was commissioned<br>by King tfal in and around the 1880s uh<br>and he uh after uh of course the dark<br>days of ratu in the 1860s the<br>confiscations of lands and land the land<br>confiscation was Ultra important cuz it<br>wasn't just the land it was actually the<br>psychological damage that it had done to<br>the people and so taal looked for<br>symbols from within the tribal history<br>uh to be able to shine a Light Of Hope<br>uh for the people and so the<br>presentation today is from uh you know a<br>perspective uh of the dark days uh of<br>the tribe and into a brighter future and<br>actually that's reflected right<br>throughout T called two TOA of the E<br>religion uh a very very sacred aspect of<br>w toi traditional law uh lari sorry to<br>particularly those two were some of the<br>remaining TOA in the E faith and the EO<br>religion which was a traditional<br>religion um according uh to to W and<br>according to the Tini<br>people they were a bit hesitant about<br>displaying some of the symbols within<br>the religion because it was a very close<br>door religion it was a very uh not so<br>much a secret society but it was only<br>imparted to those who who they felt were<br>coming up the ranks uh within uh the<br>religion itself and so um they were very<br>very hesitant about some of the<br>symbology of the E uh of the E<br>Faith the E religion was so sacran that<br>they didn't even uh they avoided the the<br>utterance of the<br>name but it it lived on throughout a<br>whole number of things and one of them<br>is<br>through it's become the code of arms<br>that was designed by T and and they took<br>a whole long time uh to complete it and<br>actually tafo had to request more than<br>three times for them uh to uh actually<br>complete it that that was the um it was<br>so s<br>there is a statement of calm of calm and<br>peace itself is the wide spread<br>C uh and uh really it's a declaration of<br>Integrity uh and unity across a number<br>of Dimensions from the spiritual to the<br>physical it's become a bit of a<br>framework as well not only uh in a<br>physical uh in a workstream uh sort of<br>uh look but in a in a very very<br>spiritual and historical uh point of<br>view uh as well it holds some of the key<br>core uh origin story principles of Wain<br>within the designs and so uh you know it<br>was uh very difficult but we're thankful<br>to people<br>like of why he<br>who was one of the last in the old F who<br>imparted his knowledge and actually gave<br>some real clues about the um the<br>explanations for tiik two people like<br>princess two people like Dr pet H Jones<br>who collated and recorded some of the<br>stories of Ed and and those ones of the<br>in their time and in turn they were able<br>to uh produce that uh for um uh for the<br>Generations the aim of today is to<br>provide a historical overview of the<br>philosophies<br>within sort of unlocking the symbology<br>of uh this design if Dan Brown had<br>written a book about it it would be<br>called the matariki code<br>okay along with the historical though<br>it's how K and W are moving to put this<br>m into practice into a framework of<br>action into processes that will um that<br>have a uh a a history and a Beginnings<br>from time of Memorial to the present day<br>and how we might look uh into the future<br>uh for um for some guidance really and<br>I'm going to touch on that uh just a<br>okay and<br>so uh the Miki Stars themselves uh<br>contrary to uh recent uh findings<br>from associate professors and doctors of<br>the University of wut wle told we<br>believe there are seven star<br>and hey Rim is right but Rahi is also<br>history but the Stars themselves frame<br>uh uh a number of stories just in<br>themselves so that's why I've broken<br>them down into the the there's about<br>seven compartments that I want to talk<br>about as far asiki goes and how they<br>relate to where we are today how they<br>relate to where we want to get to<br>tomorrow so in our view and in our<br>history Miki along with pu uh Rose from<br>another name for Papu into the heavens<br>Miki going to live with hura or the the<br>the winter maiden and actually mik when<br>he was a lucky guy cuz he was allowed to<br>have have two wives H takura the winter<br>maiden and HTI the summer maiden and so<br>you know in a in a flowery Story the sun<br>moves from the winter uh into the into<br>the summer and backward and forward so<br>matariki lived with h uh and which is<br>prevalent around the end of May June<br>around the the winter uh the winter time<br>uh in Al and she actually led the<br>pathway of Tam towards the summer months<br>and got so far that when the Sun or the<br>uh the summer uh set in that she became<br>invisible in the Stars well not so much<br>invisible but it was very very difficult<br>uh to pick out the matariki cluster in<br>the winter it's way easier to spot<br>matariki and her<br>daughters and so Miki uh is the symbol<br>of<br>memory especially to those who have<br>passed we remember at matariki time all<br>of those that have passed over the year<br>from one winter to the other cuz winter<br>in a traditional uh wakeing and Mari uh<br>form was the time where everyone came<br>closer together cuz it was Bloody<br>cold and so uh we remember Miki as the<br>memory as the uh to uh to rekindle uh<br>those memories of those who have passed<br>in recent times but matariki is also the<br>herald of<br>tomorrow she brings the past and those<br>that have gone to those that are still<br>she<br>was and so Miki would would be a bridge<br>uh at those at at a particular time uh<br>in June generally around the rising of<br>the new moon uh Miki would hold a spe<br>they would have special ceremonies in uh<br>uh to honor Miki and the roles that she<br>plays not only uh from yesterday but for<br>tomorrow uh as<br>well it's in that sort of vein that t<br>said a or prophetic<br>said and Loosely translated I've Arisen<br>from the depths of Despair and I can see<br>the stars aligning and Miki will be the<br>surveyor and at will reshape the Milky<br>Way lots and lots of that cord is T<br>likening himself to Miki rising from the<br>earth into the heavens rising from the<br>times of trouble and despair into the<br>bright lights of the Milky Way whole<br>number of those types of things and Miki<br>ensures that the lessons of the past<br>determines the actions of our future and<br>so pretty much matariki uh is the focus<br>on the uh presentation uh today today we<br>liken the depths of th that despair of<br>tal to the Troubles of the<br>1860s of the Rat prior to the<br>1860s the king and W were a very<br>industrious tribe a very wealthy tribe a<br>very healthy tribe we had Mill flower<br>mills and flax Mills we had a whole<br>number of Industry uh particularly<br>around the Ang Alia area was the food<br>basket of the W cutle that would be<br>shipped up to Oakland H and um sold in<br>the markets in Oakland traded in the<br>markets in Oakland put on to oceangoing<br>vessels that were owned by the tribe<br>that sailed out of Orland the haki and<br>cfia they would go to Australia to the<br>Americas and as far away as London<br>selling our Goods in the 1860s however<br>in one F swoop um War an invasion into<br>the wut happened uh and as a consequence<br>of that and as a cons as a consequence<br>of that 1.2 million Acres of w land was<br>seized I was<br>confiscated and so that sort of cut took<br>the wind out of the<br>sou W went from a very wealthy and<br>healthy tribe to a to a tribe that was<br>in a state of um disrepair a state that<br>meant that the land had been taken a<br>state that meant that the psychology of<br>the tribe had been<br>shaken and so a whole lot of that um<br>happened around in King taal's time<br>later on after uh the ratu and visiting<br>with major leaders like the to<br>andu a came back uh into the wut uh he<br>came back into the wut and he made a<br>number of mission statements that we<br>call Tonga and those Tonga are alive and<br>well a lot of them are alive and well<br>today one of them was um they will come<br>people and so uh in the times and it was<br>like in in the times of<br>1995 uh to the times<br>brother they moved from the darkness of<br>theu into into the staran path of<br>settlement cuz there were very few<br>footprints in the sand in<br>1995 there were there were some<br>settlements of the crown but there were<br>no major uh e settlements of the crown<br>that took into account uh those types of<br>things that actually said that it was<br>about time that wle moved from um uh the<br>grief stricken state of remembering ratu<br>into a period of development and so uh<br>he said a pathway uh into that<br>development from 1995 some uh 21 years<br>uh ago but the settlement was a<br>beginning not an end the settlement set<br>in place a whole new Pathway to to<br>Traverse and to walk<br>down our past had dictated that there<br>were a number of trials and tribulations<br>there were some good times as well andot<br>wanted to set the tribe onto a<br>pathway of uh getting back to the golden<br>years of wake tiny prior to no budget to<br>the times where we were industrious to<br>the times where we were trading to the<br>times where we were prosperous that we<br>were healthy that we were happy and in<br>those times King was uh at the height of<br>it of its uh existence and he wanted to<br>set forward on a pathway to get back to<br>those<br>times so we're actually reaching back<br>into the past to determine what we do in<br>our<br>future in our tradition<br>Miki W tid tradition just going to make<br>that clear again just in case Dr MAA mu<br>is amongst us somewhere but uh in our<br>Traditions matariki had six daughters<br>and each of them held their own<br>reminders and so you'll see the star<br>cluster of seven on every Kinga flag<br>right from the times of taal right<br>through to<br>kingu the matariki cluster uh has been<br>uh prevalent on each of their personal<br>standards it's also been uh a reminder<br>about our traditional past and our<br>origin<br>stories and so in our view uh there were<br>uh a set of twins the the eldest of the<br>children<br>YT how make with them YT reminds us uh<br>in our view of the ho and Thea the wind<br>and the Very ear that we breathe so a<br>lot of them remind us about those<br>essential aspects that we need as people<br>as and so YT reminds us of<br>the the the wind and the air why wa<br>tells us about the water the tidal salt<br>water and the fresh way<br>Mali air and water some of the key<br>elements of our very uh<br>existence whyi talks about the rain the<br>snow the the moistness of the morning<br>Jew all of those things uh from an<br>elemental uh point of uh point of view<br>so in our<br>environment uh the growth of foods and<br>of so not only for food to sustain uh<br>the body but also to heal us uh when<br>we're and that's in a both in a physical<br>yeah is not just about M medicines it's<br>about the kakia and those types of<br>things that go with it as well T talking<br>about the shelter and the clothing the<br>tools of traditional Arts all of those<br>types of things I remembered<br>the the<br>youngest is talk reminds us about our<br>own um uh place um in the world our uh<br>it talks about Mankind and it makes sure<br>the p is the youngest<br>one all of the have a responsibility to<br>look after the piki and so here we are<br>as people as mankind without with all of<br>the elements that help us to remain uh<br>Health uh healthy uh and safe in our<br>worldview and so urangi talks about the<br>the elements uh and the environment as<br>it relates to us as people and so the<br>Seven Stars all have their particular<br>reminders and every time matariki shines<br>in the in the sky is a reminder about<br>all of these types of things about our<br>mortality about the things we have to<br>rely<br>on uh the air that we breathe the water<br>that we drink the cake that we all of<br>those types of things are reflected in<br>our view within the Miki<br>Stars Miki and her daughters show us of<br>the relationship our relationship to our<br>surroundings we were very<br>environmentally focused uh uh and we're<br>still environmentally<br>focused and we rely on our relatives the<br>other stars the other reminder stars of<br>the Miki to to simply<br>survive today our tribal aspirations are<br>the care and protection of these<br>Essential Elements both in an<br>environmental sense in a physical sense<br>and in a spiritual sense a whole lot of<br>those types of things have guided Us in<br>the development of our very TI of our<br>very real the real that we say uh today<br>comes from the background of those<br>reminder elements of<br>mik you know tribal groups have been<br>accused and some of them rightly so of<br>focusing on forestry farming fish and<br>fena and those are all part of our Miki<br>story so we make no apologies for those<br>but ENT but another essential component<br>he you got it bro<br>too coupled with our environmental<br>aspects has to be the sustaining of the<br>health and well-being of our<br>families young old and in the<br>middle nuclear<br>extended cousins brothers from another<br>mother you know all of those types of<br>things are all reflected and the<br>reminders that Miki provides not only<br>every year but every day cuz matariki<br>although difficult to see is always<br>constant people we come and go but these<br>reminders have been there there from the<br>dawning of time and they will be there<br>long after we're gone and the keys of<br>matariki it's our responsibility to pass<br>those to the coming Generations so that<br>they can understand their Heritage their<br>legacy that that are the stars of<br>matariki another core component of tiak<br>matariki is the symbol of<br>or the pulsating<br>heart reminding us that well um our Mana<br>talks about our<br>up belief in the<br>spirit Manawa reminds us of Tuple to<br>take<br>here Manawa also reminds us of our<br>values and our core<br>principles the core principles of the<br>the king and<br>of you can<br>see in the man that there is an alien<br>figure on the<br>top alien to traditional Mari belief<br>right and that's because<br>T<br>and really really thought about it they<br>felt that there were some real there<br>were some close alignments between the<br>knowledge that they held in the ancient<br>to those of the Old Testament of the<br>Bible and so the Bible became the crown<br>king wasn't crowned with gold and silver<br>and emeralds and rubies he was crowned<br>and Anointed with the oil uh and the<br>Bible and I and I acknowledge the Tumi<br>anaru Thompson uh who consecrated that<br>that same Bible on the head of King TOA<br>in<br>2006 and so that's become the Bible has<br>become the platform it's become the<br>foundation of uh the king and so it was<br>incorporated the cross was incorporated<br>into the design of tiak matariki in the<br>times of King<br>taia taia when he was born um to mat uh<br>well two caral and then he was Christ<br>three times in three separate<br>denominations in the Catholic and the uh<br>Wesleyan or the Methodist and in the<br>Anglican and people said thought why get<br>Christen into three different<br>churches my simple answer was I think<br>the old people thought it was a dollar<br>each way into how to get into<br>heaven it was like uh if the anges were<br>right choice if the Catholics were right<br>St Choice hey and so um that was<br>reflected and part of that was even<br>though Teo himself never got christened<br>he allowed his children to be christened<br>into the English denominations but what<br>he did too was he also made sure that<br>they were schooled in the old far so T<br>attended the old far at<br>and he also attended the<br>old and thereby building the traditional<br>knowledge with the knowledge of the<br>missionaries and mouting them together<br>the the missionaries uh renamed him well<br>his Christian name became<br>matuta uh and so matuta or mathusa uh<br>became uh his name later on he got a bit<br>dismayed when after the ratu he was<br>abandoned by those that were so some of<br>his um uh great friends had abandoned<br>him and they were part and parcel of<br>those denominations so he cast the name<br>aside and took on a more Maru name that<br>was given to him by the taranaki peoples<br>and that became then he became<br>tafia there were a few other names uh<br>but uh essentially though taal became<br>the name uh which he was known by so<br>King Mata or<br>kingfa uh and so the combination of the<br>um of the of Christianity within tiak<br>matariki became another foundation stone<br>for the king but actually T has a number<br>of um symbols in<br>ofup<br>so you'll see the two<br>tongues people say fork tongues all<br>those types of things and you'll see M<br>manwa holding on to those Tong reminding<br>us that<br>actually words can raise a person to the<br>greatest of heights but words can also<br>decimate the wer of a person so we need<br>to be careful we need to uh utilize<br>those types of things things when they<br>need to be utilized but it's but to be<br>careful about doing it and to always do<br>intentions and so Manawa talks to us<br>about the values talks to us about the<br>key and core principles and so I suppose<br>in today's um uh world uh Manawa is<br>actually the symbol uh of uh the mighty<br>King's personal standard he's taken the<br>Manawa from mik and set it aside as his<br>own personal standard because of those<br>um uh those<br>aspects today our core values in our Tik<br>uh are the litmus test within which we<br>evaluate the Merit of Grants and<br>distributions of our strategies and our<br>work streams and work plans all of them<br>in our view have to have to reflect our<br>values all of the<br>tongas<br>man the duty of<br>care you know all of those types of<br>wonderful and fuzzy things uh that we<br>talk<br>about<br>Mah all of those um things that talk<br>about the unity uh cuz the unification<br>is one of the core principles of the<br>king so is manak looking after people<br>whether they are visitors uh to your<br>marai or to kangi the duty of K or the<br>duty<br>ofak U is always reflected in the<br>pulsating heart of the<br>king those core values and those types<br>of things are actually drive to the<br>heart of where the king Tanga sits in a<br>modern day uh<br>context we talk about um different uh<br>sayings of the Kings<br>said if it's good for the people get on<br>and do<br>it<br>and we all know sometimes it's better to<br>said we must be Resolute and and we we<br>must be Resolute uh in finding ways to<br>look after our people he wasn't just<br>talking about his family or his wider<br>who he was talking about all peoples All<br>Peoples from all walks of life and from<br>all of the corners of the globe that's<br>reflected in<br>man that's our heart you wear your heart<br>on your sleeve we wear our heart within<br>tiak<br>omiki the next aspect is about<br>kopu uh and coru uh is a particular uh<br>design uh that was derived from the old<br>and if any of you have<br>read the writings of<br>Dr he actually went on to design a<br>number of these takari spirals that<br>reflect a number of different aspects<br>but kopu features as a prominent feature<br>onik kopu talks is the takari spiral<br>from the old fana K is about reflec our<br>past but it's also about setting our<br>future and that's why uh the two Kuru<br>patterns there um they weave a rich<br>history a full Heritage and intertwines<br>it uh with a brighter<br>future the the the aspect of kopu is<br>that there is no beginning and there is<br>no<br>end that the that it comes and that it<br>flows our past and our future looking at<br>all of our the richness of our heritage<br>and Legacy and passing that on to the<br>our<br>today we learn the lessons of the<br>past and those lessons solidify our<br>present our present will inform our<br>future<br>our past and our future are inextricably<br>bound they work together and so the<br>aspects of K the ins and the<br>which you have a<br>look because there is no end and when<br>you get to the end it goes out again and<br>comes back in again it's the never<br>ending uh circle of life circle of<br>heritage<br>generations and that's a bit of a play<br>on words and that was constructed by my<br>uh sister pa uh in a<br>presentation Moody is both front and<br>back okay<br>hey so moody and mua are talking about<br>in front of you and behind you because<br>that's what corpal represents for us it<br>future similarly to are the Tonga of uh<br>yester<br>year and they uh uh so<br>AI uh people said ah you you know uh<br>that's a faki I said oh actually there's<br>a bit of a<br>difference so a faki is a proverbial<br>saying whereas a Tuda is a guiding<br>statement it's it's not so much a<br>Visionary statement because in a<br>Visionary statement or a<br>uhu those things come to a fruition at<br>some time Auda is strategically worded<br>because it doesn't have any ending<br>they are toika are relevant are as<br>relevant as they were in the times of t<br>K hey when we buil our house when tafia<br>built his house it's a totally different<br>house to the house that kingu haa is<br>trying to build but that's what the<br>intent of that Tonga<br>is every generation will build their own<br>house every generation will set their<br>own pathway every generation will have<br>will have to acquire the tools that they<br>need in in a given situation so that<br>they can confront the challenges of life<br>and meet them head<br>on that's what kopu represents as well<br>coru is named for the womb because we<br>all come from a<br>beginning when we go on to a and a<br>belief is that we don't go on just by<br>ourselves or when visitors come to our<br>it's not just about the physical person<br>standing in front of you it's about<br>their Heritage in their fak papa right<br>back to the beginnings of time and so<br>when the hungi happens it's actually the<br>sharing of faka Papa it's the sharing of<br>those that we can't see anymore and just<br>because we can't see them doesn't mean<br>that they're not always<br>there that's what kopu represents it<br>represents our Papa right back to<br>the beginnings of time it it it reminds<br>us that we are going to create<br>Papa until our time stands<br>still and so corpal reminds us of those<br>uh core values uh and uh aspects uh<br>within the tribal um domain as<br>well the two<br>gentlemen and you can see how Mana<br>relates to<br>Corporal with the care and<br>compassion alongside your core<br>values the two on the left hand side is<br>AA on the right hand side<br>at two very spiritual Dimensions that<br>remind us about<br>t about uh people say oh no you can't<br>have uh i2r or calamities and all of<br>that sorts of things well in our view uh<br>in probably our own view that the two<br>figures represent the good and the<br>bad the good and the bad cuz Anu can can<br>Tiny they represent the honorable and<br>the<br>scarless and for as sure as night<br>follows<br>day these two will always be amongst<br>us it's up to us<br>though it's up to us how we employ them<br>at different times you know sometimes it<br>L and it's about and it's up to us how<br>they relate to our hearts it's up to us<br>how it relates to our coru to our<br>Generations in the modern era I like to<br>think that mistakes are made in the a2r<br>sort of division of the<br>world but then mistakes become<br>lessons mistakes become the lessons that<br>we learn<br>from mistakes become those things that<br>you are not doomed to repeat again<br>because you've learned from your<br>mistake and we must be vigilant when it<br>comes uh to things like due<br>diligence cuz you know in the ratu in<br>the 1860s of prior to the 1860s we had a<br>lot of<br>friends Mai and non-mi<br>we had a lot of friends the king had a<br>lot of<br>friends<br>1863 when the government sent its troops<br>across the<br>M quite a number of those friends<br>disappeared and so there were some that<br>some of them would say some things in<br>the morning and say something quite<br>different in the<br>afternoon they were they were um<br>actually uh being quite scarless uh in<br>their approach to the king some of them<br>like uh one of our um fantastic<br>missionaries that was present at R Alia<br>became the the colonial troops<br>spy spying on maldi befriending maldi<br>and then reporting back uh about and<br>actually reporting back um uh with a<br>bunch of lies that led to that led to<br>the decimation of some of our farno at<br>Angi later on that same guy took up a<br>station in or puki and started to do the<br>same things until some of the other<br>events happen and that calls Ru<br>within lots of those types of things is<br>about who do you<br>trust it's about who do you trust and<br>how much do you trust them so in a<br>modern uh type um<br>situation A and ATA is about doing your<br>homework doing your due diligence as it<br>relates to Investments as it relates to<br>relationships<br>1995 was a fantast saw a fantastic error<br>for w in that we were able to settle<br>the by hand we settled the ru in<br>1995 the government of the day promised<br>a number of things they promised that if<br>there was any governmental land that<br>came up for sale they would offer it<br>back to wake ory in the first instance<br>for purchase thereby trying uh aiding<br>wake ory to repatriate the tribal estate<br>that was once under the domain of<br>P<br>awesome unfortunately over 21 years<br>there have been breaches after breaches<br>after<br>breaches 1840 we signed up well<br>actually never signed up but number of<br>Mari Chiefs signed up to a relationship<br>document<br>breach and so those two have been with<br>us they will always be with<br>us there will always be uh some things<br>that uh we find difficult uh to find<br>trustworthy but then there's going to be<br>genuine<br>there's going to be uh some genuine<br>friends uh as<br>well you know and due diligence just<br>doesn't mean in a Paka context due<br>diligence means best practice means the<br>best tools that we have today because<br>tomorrow there may be another app or<br>another um uh digital um copopa that we<br>can get into that is a little bit better<br>than today<br>but it also means melting those with our<br>with our hearts looking at it from a<br>duty of care uh perspective looking at<br>it from a values and a core principles<br>perspective all of those things are<br>reflected and they they're in the middle<br>ofik for a reason yeah with the ancient<br>uh ways of looking at things we're<br>always reminded about these uh types of<br>things about looking at uh those things<br>uh about<br>trustworthiness looking at things like<br>due diligence looking at things like<br>melting our Tik and our core principles<br>into our work of on an everyday basis<br>and so um the middle part there uh<br>is one of the uh and I remember uh<br>people saying oh you<br>know uh shouldn't be part and parcel<br>of you know you're encouraging people to<br>be not so<br>said how can you taste the sweetness of<br>righteousness if you have haven't tasted<br>the bitterness of<br>wrongness so you our<br>lessons the past become our lessons the<br>past becomes things that worked things<br>that didn't work and they don't<br>necessarily have to translate uh into<br>today but they must be a<br>consideration just because it didn't<br>work for one generation doesn't mean<br>it's not okay to try it again but<br>knowing some of the uh you know to<br>maneuver uh some of the aspects of those<br>lessons to suit uh the tools that we<br>today and then on one side<br>have of course K is an essential<br>ingredient uh in the physical health of<br>the<br>people K was so so important to our<br>ancestors that if you look around in<br>every<br>tribe and in every<br>Community the majority of their faki the<br>majority of their cor leads or shapes or<br>talks about in some way shape or form<br>K cuz it was so important to us as a<br>people Kai provides food not only uh<br>for the nourishment of the physical but<br>it also provides for the nourishment of<br>the<br>Soul you know they say you know a man<br>PKU these symbols talk about just some<br>of those K yeah some of those K that we<br>derive from nature but it also talks<br>about actually hard work and the ethic<br>of planting and<br>harvesting all of those types of things<br>hard work allow our people to survive<br>the root systems of our native Flora the<br>fruits of our<br>trees the birds of the<br>forests the fish of the rivers and<br>lakes all of those type<br>of natural K that our ancestors that our<br>T enjoyed they made for a seasonal<br>Harvest that provided for the sustenance<br>and the nutrition uh of the<br>people part and parcel of uh those times<br>also was um uh a bit of a a bit of a t a<br>bit of a uh disagreement between<br>Governor gray and PTO when he said<br>can't and in other words it wasn't up to<br>him uh to um do away with the principles<br>of the king and Governor Grace said to<br>him if you don't put your kingy Tonga<br>down then I'm going to bring a cow and<br>that cow is going to drink all of your<br>water and you're going to have no water<br>left and Theo said to him my water comes<br>earth comes from the depths of the earth<br>and you can't drink all of that<br>bro and so Governor graay said well I'm<br>going to eat I'm going to allow my cow<br>to eat all of your C at the F said well<br>if you eat all of that then I'm going to<br>turn back to the fern R to the adad uh<br>to all of those things uh that that they<br>look like a poor man's food uh in your<br>eyes and we'll eat that and Governor<br>gray said well what happens uh when all<br>of those are gone well what then will<br>you<br>so you know that there's K stories are<br>absolutely fantastic in his time taal<br>also took from a saying<br>ofu uh who was a major tuna in the<br>taranaki region uh and he took uh a<br>goes and that's part of the origin<br>stories of the poai poai in its purest<br>form means to feed the people yeah to be<br>a pillar that provides sustenance of the<br>people and so poai have become a<br>traditional kangi where people come they<br>don't just come for the food although<br>that's a huge part of it but they come<br>for the discussion they come uh for all<br>of the uh the historical and tribal<br>elements that are part and parcel of<br>poai of course how do you accentuate<br>that with a good feed hey and the Mana<br>of a m generally generally rests on how<br>good good the feed<br>was you can have the most brilliant<br>speakers on the pie the most wonderful K<br>ladies the most beautiful songsters uh<br>in the whole wide world and if you get a<br>terrible kind people will<br>Mo mind you they'll M anyway so if you<br>have an awesome clay and you have<br>terrible speakers they'll<br>M but one of the essential aspects of<br>the manor of a person is how well they<br>provide<br>man to the<br>visitors yeah and so that's reflected<br>inik as well remembering reminding us<br>that even if you don't have much even if<br>you have only the scarcest of<br>resources feed the<br>people<br>uphold<br>the uphold the Mana not only only of<br>your morai but of your tribe and your<br>people as well and so today that's what<br>Wan has set forth on how do we then grow<br>the sustenance and the nutrition of w<br>people cuz what's good for w is good for<br>the wa and what's good for w is good for<br>the<br>nation that's always going to be our Mot<br>if it's good for w t then it's good for<br>the W and if it's good for the W then<br>it's good for the nation today just<br>throughout and I acknowledge CH and his<br>K of white to<br>says part and parcel of the Wake River<br>uh is that it provides uh in excess of<br>15%<br>of the GDP of our country and that's<br>that's because of the Fertile lands<br>that's because of the river uh itself<br>it's a huge uh huge amount and it's<br>getting higher because you know um Chase<br>and the<br>of add to Alo and Tamaki Makoto every<br>time they turn the tap<br>on every time they turn the tap on they<br>the a whole lot of that uh those types<br>of situations and that's why the won we<br>feel so strongly about the care and<br>protection of the river not only because<br>it came from the sayings of T and and<br>those before us but in the modern day<br>context<br>said We Belong To The River as the river<br>belongs to us not in a proprietary right<br>not in a proprietary sort of context but<br>but actually in a context we believe<br>that the W river is a tupuna to W T not<br>just a body of water that flows past at<br>so many liters per second we actually<br>believe that W was a Tupa is an<br>umbilical cord for the sustenance not<br>only of the land but of the people and<br>so much so that W took its name from its<br>other I and I see H wife py over there<br>so all the questions about that can go<br>at and so they they show the Essential<br>Elements of shelter and clothing and the<br>Traditions uh that goes with those cuz a<br>happy uh home houses a happy family safe<br>and warm environments produce um U lead<br>the leaders of tomorrow all of those<br>types of things and we know that there<br>is a housing crisis at the moment even<br>though some of the politicians won't uh<br>agree to that we we know that uh<br>actually some of our people are in those<br>depths of Despair again and when it<br>comes to shelter and clothing we saw it<br>over the winter months as de marai<br>opened its doors to the homeless we saw<br>it as people were parking up in Oakland<br>parks because of the toiletry facilities<br>and they were sleeping in their cars and<br>a lot of these people are<br>employed lot of these people are<br>employed they just can't afford the rent<br>of today even with a job and so they uh<br>they hop in their car some of them have<br>tamariki<br>tamarik some of them were elderly and<br>so felt that they needed a a place of<br>respot a place for a shortterm gap<br>filler that would turn the attention of<br>the governmental agencies on and Shine<br>the spotlight onto them so that they<br>could be<br>helped to now<br>man the um our Faro out west at<br>Theo they were also helping<br>at and things like that and actually a<br>number of our Mar have been doing it for<br>a number of<br>years for a number of years it just<br>hasn't gained the medor attention of uh<br>the recent uh<br>crisis and<br>so this part of tariki reminds us that<br>actually the tribe has a<br>duty the tribe has a duty but the tribe<br>cannot afford to allow the government to<br>Abate its<br>responsibilities but we must work<br>together<br>we must work together to fulfill those<br>inik look if we you know in this housing<br>crisis if the environment make it the<br>man then we must assist our people to be<br>the happiest Faro that they can be we<br>need them uh to be safe and warm those<br>are essential elements we need them to<br>have K we need them uh so without those<br>key and core Essential Elements then<br>we're dooming our people uh to uh you<br>know uh a life of Despair and we want to<br>um raise them uh pull them out of that<br>pit and we want to allow them to go<br>forth and<br>flourish but like I said we will never<br>allow the government to abrogate its<br>responsibilities in this<br>area working together though will help<br>not only the government but will help<br>the E achieve its aspirations because as<br>long as there's one homeless person from<br>W Ori then the tribe has more work to<br>do as long as there's one child in si<br>care the tribe has more work to do as<br>long as there's one Wy person uh in<br>incarcerated in prison the tribe has<br>more work to do on an advocacy basis as<br>well as an assistance<br>basis but essentially working alongside<br>our governmental departments so that<br>they can get their act together uh and<br>provide the assistance uh that they have<br>U promised to all newal lers including<br>Mali under article three of the<br>treaty we know that housing our shelter<br>our Pap that is part of the trib's<br>housing strategy that has just been<br>signed off<br>by part of that is moving people up<br>the from homelessness into uh safe and<br>warm uh housing from there into rental<br>accommodation ations and allow uh<br>assisting them to be able to sustain uh<br>in a rental in rental accommodations<br>rental accommodations into Home<br>Ownership home ownership helps not only<br>that one particular family but it helps<br>a whole lot of families uh at the same<br>time and so with those with those um you<br>know climbing up the fat or the housing<br>p uh that's where wany is turning uh its<br>attention to be able to draw down the<br>assistance not only from<br>tuni and their housing their k fenua<br>type um structures but also across the<br>housing uh portfolios of government<br>across the shelter um um portfolios of<br>government across the uh and the elderly<br>portfolios of the New Zealand<br>government and we want to see our<br>people we want to<br>eradicate homelessness within W tan by<br>at least<br>2050 that's not to mention people will<br>say oh that's too bloody Long hey and<br>you're right but PE uh but that's not to<br>mention our 5year 10year and 15year<br>Milestones as we track towards that all<br>the time increasing the assistance<br>that's available not only to wake or t<br>we people uh but to all of those so like<br>I said if if it's good for Wake T then<br>it's good for the wake and if it's good<br>for Wake then it's good for the nation<br>that<br>assistance will have to be so w tan can<br>Advocate uh on a um on on<br>a a proformer basis but that assistance<br>should be offered to all communities<br>within the W<br>cutle this is not just inaki Makoto<br>problem this is not just a poor necked<br>problem this is a problem that is um<br>prevalent in almost all of our<br>country I know you're probably thinking<br>oh this is just a soapbox opportunity<br>for AR we<br>but<br>and I suppose one of the key elements is<br>ofak very very um interesting that the<br>two TOA of the E religion actually put<br>words on the<br>Insignia cuz generally it's the<br>symbology uh generally it's the art form<br>that speaks<br>in their in their uh views right but<br>they Incorporated the the cross of<br>Incorporated everyone will have their<br>view on what manamu hake is and actually<br>just across the way there Leo pmer is<br>facilitating a um a cord about people's<br>different views on manamu hakei some of<br>the key words and Concepts though about<br>manam is power control leadership<br>self-determination<br>Independence autonomy<br>self-reliance sovereignty and all of<br>those are<br>correct one of the hardest words to<br>translate is the word Mana because there<br>is no single concept in the English uh<br>dictionary that can cater for the<br>expanse that is the word<br>Mana manake involves all of those Co<br>Concepts and more it involves also our<br>traditional Frameworks it involves our<br>origin stories it involves our<br>epistemologies in our in our origin<br>stories it involves uh and all of those<br>are connected to our Manu<br>manake can be viewed in a number of ways<br>manake can be viewed in a personal way<br>occasion if you turned right instead of<br>left then you end up but that was your<br>choice cuz m is not only you determining<br>your pathway but it's taking the<br>responsibility for the choices of of the<br>took and so<br>too in the view of the king and the<br>tribe it's not just about the right or<br>left turn as we go through the points on<br>the historical<br>timeline if we if Tao had have done this<br>then this would have hey all of those<br>turns have been made but it's up to us<br>to determine the right or the left terms<br>that we need to make but it's also<br>beholden on us to accept the<br>responsibility of the turn that we<br>make and we will be judged is sure as<br>there's a Miki in the skies our Muna<br>would look back and I don't know why the<br>hell Kur did<br>that or they're going to say man my<br>Coral was awesome because he left this<br>for<br>us hopefully hopefully uh the the the<br>self-determination that we create today<br>uh will be appreciated in coming<br>Generations as I'm sure uh it will<br>be and in the Modern Age Mana is about<br>shaping our own<br>destiny the thing about Mana is that in<br>a democratic era the tribe giveth and<br>years but then that's the concept of<br>democracy monot hake in my view is about<br>seizing the opportunities to create our<br>own<br>destiny it's about forging our own<br>pathway on our terms and our<br>conditions it's about um dancing to the<br>beat of Our Own<br>Drum it's all about<br>it's also about the tools and the skills<br>that we need to acquire to make sure<br>that we can uh make the best decisions<br>pathway I'm going to Fashion my own<br>house I'm going to set the pathway of my<br>people<br>for this is the end game of the<br>king but it's an end that will never<br>ever come because every generation will<br>have to navigate their own<br>Pathways every generation will have<br>their own<br>challenges alls that we can do in the<br>current generation is to provide them<br>with as many tools skills Heritage<br>Legacy<br>best practice due diligence that we can<br>possibly give for them the examples of<br>today will help our mapuna determine the<br>tomorrow it's about our people our ways<br>our<br>way how do we determine how do we<br>determine uh which TI is appropriate for<br>the now and which TI is appropriate for<br>tomorrow we decide that we decide it on<br>a personal basis every day we also do<br>that on a marai basis on an Hau basis on<br>an e<br>basis sometimes there may be some<br>maneuvering<br>of one Tik uh um will lead uh to uh a<br>movement of Tik that provides something<br>that is ticker for the people of that<br>us used to tell a<br>story about two old Fells uh sitting in<br>the W with the young ones and one k<br>standing up and said uh you're not<br>allowed to wear hats in the F uh you're<br>not allowed to smoke in the F you're not<br>allow to wear your shoes in the F while<br>the other fell was sitting there with<br>his hat on having a smoke with his shoes<br>on and the young fell says Hey C you're<br>talking about all of those things and<br>look at that fell beside you he's<br>Breaking All the<br>Rules and this old fell uh put his head<br>up and said to them when you know the up<br>the down and all of the sides about TI<br>expressing here my he was expressing<br>man and so you know that little<br>story has a has a number of uh<br>meanings but the essential one is um<br>that we must determine for ourselves<br>what is right what is ticker for us at<br>any given time and that will inform us<br>and hopefully we will have all of the<br>information that we require to make the<br>best choices uh and<br>decisions manamu hake is a is a the end<br>game of the K but it's an end that will<br>never<br>come<br>because will be the aspiration of every<br>successive<br>generation and each generation will<br>achieve some uh some measure of<br>man but each will leave a legacy and a<br>stronger platform for the Next<br>Generation to Aspire to and to spring<br>board<br>from is the symbol<br>of because it incorporates all of those<br>said no matter how many people turn<br>their attention away from the King even<br>I'm if I'm left with 100 even if I'm<br>left with 50 even if I'm left with only<br>Survive is also about those things that<br>we find in our heart in our spirit in<br>our physical being all of those things<br>combined is our personal man<br>a that was Beed to us from generation<br>upon generation upon generation<br>something that is our responsibility to<br>pass on to a<br>generation after generation after<br>generation it's about strength it's<br>about fortitude it's about<br>self-confidence and<br>self-belief all of those attributes<br>helping us to achieve some type of<br>personal<br>manake and if we achieve some type of<br>personal<br>manake then ouro can achieve a type uh<br>some aspects of the of manamu and if Alo<br>is strong in manam so too then will be<br>our Hau and our I and if our I are<br>strong with M then our nation will be<br>even<br>stronger<br>just some examples also about<br>tiik and how has been uh it's evolved uh<br>throughout the generation and you'll see<br>in the top right hand corner uh that<br>tiak Miki was the first name of the<br>newspaper that later became known<br>as and<br>soik was an adaptation of uh the<br>symbology uh s was printed at the M head<br>of those newspapers in and around the<br>1880s 1880s through uh to the 1890s well<br>actually by the end of the 1880s they<br>had changed the name<br>to and<br>soik was about the K fighting fire with<br>fire because after the 1860s there were<br>a whole number of Publications that just<br>damned Mari they damned W cutle for<br>being Rebels against the<br>crown Rebels with the<br>cause they damned W cutle for<br>being uh for having a view of self some<br>self-control and<br>self-determination they damned wle for<br>being um uh you know a challenger to the<br>current to the situation that was<br>happening in New Zealand at that time<br>and so ta and a number of his strong<br>shoulders in<br>editor they said oh hell enough is<br>enough quite fortunately a couple of men<br>fromo had traveled to um Austria and had<br>met the grand Juke and his gift to them<br>was a printing press and so they bought<br>it back they set it up and they started<br>printing their own newspaper actually it<br>became very very popular very very<br>popular it was also um<br>uh and those sorts of uh wonderful guys<br>that added to the content and they<br>thought no bug we're going to have our<br>own newspaper we're going to give our<br>messages in our way this is about Manu<br>h of course as soon as it started<br>becoming popular<br>the P set up a rival newspaper in<br>of just imagine going into the local da<br>newspaper but<br>because they they felt that the h<br>was just propaganda from these<br>mares and they were<br>right of course it was but if you could<br>tell your message in your own way then<br>man unincumbered<br>uninhibited by anyone else who who gives<br>a toss what they say about your messages<br>you're getting your messages out in your<br>own way it was a communication<br>tool but it was all to do with the the<br>steps<br>to and of course the doorway of<br>Mah uh is also<br>Heralds really it was created uh<br>alongside and with the cars of the East<br>Coast uh and some of our own Foo uh at<br>that time the likes of pipu uh and um um<br>Waka Graham and others like that and<br>they<br>created on the doors of Mah to symbolize<br>um a doorway a doorway from our past<br>into our future and from the present<br>back into our past because it had to be<br>the two-way<br>street it had to be uh something that<br>open and so they looked at those types<br>of things and and having those Eternal<br>symbols in the view of<br>everybody sadly most times when we have<br>a the doors are open<br>so is a little bit<br>hidden but we always know that that's<br>what they they're protecting that<br>doorway cuz Mahari is the seat of King<br>hati his<br>past inside the house his present and<br>his future sitting outside on<br>the<br>door binding our past uh into our future<br>and<br>framework is a statement of man of<br>self-determined<br>self-determination of<br>selfreliance building in the spiritual<br>dimensions of our bygone past building<br>in the the core values the duty of care<br>the compassion for people<br>building in our<br>spiritual building in our<br>physical building in our<br>culture building in our<br>tongy all of that is reflected<br>within and how do those things<br>influence today it's symbols<br>like because it's because t<br>is also the the the flag that gets<br>raised every within two<br>grounds and when nanes do the to that<br>like and so Miki becomes more than just<br>paintings on a<br>flag Miki becomes the Eternal symbol of<br>the king and its duty to welcome people<br>into the fold of the K it's<br>about it's about Unity it's about coming<br>about know I can see two people just<br>there<br>and I said to oh 12:00 that's bloody too<br>have we might have time<br>questions<br>the F of King William<br>and the flag was<br>flowing<br>and as part of the King Tong<br>of we have spoken of this before with<br>and yourself I keep asking why is it<br>that they do not fly the the flag that<br>was flown about that all the CHS at the<br>time of the<br>king why is this not part of the the<br>whole cop<br>in why is display what is the purpose as<br>you talk of<br>those to it is another future that that<br>is there that was put place but like<br>like the kingy tongue at the start was<br>challenged and moved and the whole<br>history has not<br>been uh told so then the next Generation<br>miss an<br>element one part of element that is not<br>in the equation of making decisions in<br>righteousness and truth then they cannot<br>find the true way to the copy of or<br>enter the door for all truth must be<br>reveal I'm<br>asking<br>as to<br>why<br>flag the simple answer in my view was<br>that because in the times of<br>PTO that that was the uh standard uh<br>that was flown in taal's time he he<br>specifically asked to design a standard<br>that was within the uh religious beliefs<br>of the TOA of that time so it was<br>incorporated so one of the things that<br>even though the stars are there uh<br>mainly with mahangi or the U Southern<br>Cross that taal wanted those TOA to come<br>up with the standard andak matariki was<br>the standard and so it wasn't so much<br>late to rest but because every King has<br>had their own personal<br>standards whereas tiak matariki has<br>become the generic King standard and so<br>that's recognized as the color of P when<br>we celebrated the 150 years of<br>kingitanga there were a number of<br>Standards the Triangular flags were also<br>flown at paba and things like that and<br>so and so was the standard uh there and<br>as you quite rightly point out um like I<br>saido never signed the Treaty of<br>whiteo uh agreed to and accented<br>to uh he did it after so 1835 the was<br>born he signed in<br>1839 at Tamaki there thereby allowing uh<br>that man and that's one of the reasons<br>why he wouldn't sign the Treaty of white<br>but uh to get into the uh sort of<br>historical nness of it is that that was<br>viewed as a particular flag of<br>P even even though uh it had been agreed<br>to same too to all to mahut's flag with<br>the rainbow and the Stars same too uh<br>with kori's flag same too with tata's uh<br>flag with the Kahu and all of those<br>types of things they are viewed as the<br>within the King Tong I think is that<br>they are viewed as uh particular and<br>personal uh to those uh to those kings<br>and those monarchs whereas tiak mat<br>by virtue of taal establishing that and<br>really<br>entrenching as the code of arms as the<br>king C I think that's probably over time<br>a little bit so probably<br>it so uh I<br>just like to thank aru on um sharing the<br>symbolism of t tapak or mariki um it was<br>this is going to be one of those talks<br>that I think we'll think about for a<br>long time there so many layers I mean I<br>guess that's the par of of a of<br>symbolism is that they they resonate on<br>a whole number of<br>levels um uh particularly uh the a<br>couple of things that resonated for me<br>was the kopu in terms of building a<br>future based on a past and using that to<br>um ensure that our mistakes become<br>lessons um and um having that firm base<br>of core principles and another thing<br>which is it was the kai aspect um my I<br>don't know if it's because I grew up in<br>puku but every time anyone was going to<br>come to our house our mother would round<br>us all up and we had to get the Kai<br>ready for the for the for the visitors<br>and it became a bit of an obsession and<br>um to me as well now even and now if<br>people come to visit the faculty or if<br>they come to visit my home I have to<br>feed them it's just like inside me and<br>it is about um it is about um that hard<br>work work to sustain people but it's<br>also about food as a as a way of<br>maintaining those social relationships<br>and um also I teach in crime uh criminal<br>law and um it resonated with me and and<br>and around the shelter wealth and safety<br>of people is<br>there's no use to if we want to reduce<br>crime in New Zealand there's no use<br>building more prisons there's no use um<br>having more police uh the way to solve<br>crime in New Zealand is to ensure that<br>our our people are fed that they have a<br>home that they have that they're not<br>living in poverty and that's I mean<br>that's really hard for a government<br>who's only focused on three years um but<br>it is something that U tinui and also<br>the pakia population has to deal with<br>otherwise we're never going to deal with<br>deal with crime so<br>so thank you for sharing that and it<br>resonates with me and I'm sure it'll<br>resonate on multiple levels with all<br>C</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
