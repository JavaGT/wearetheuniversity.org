eaten a de raha hai Ouya<br>Hachi da fukn knew it the kakapo tira<br>tira AL bottom of the kini comma Y knew<br>your wife or to me I'm worried<br>pamalakaya by Medicare are dope i might<br>add each other in public at all<br>okay ah i basically he don't know me my<br>name is de taco keygen<br>my liquor in the computer science<br>department and i'm here to welcome<br>everybody here quite often in these<br>talks we have someone get up and welcome<br>the speakers but because<br>two-thirds of the speakers actually form<br>here this kind of not much point us<br>giving up and welcoming ourselves<br>but i'd like to before i start just<br>think Reese mores come come all the way<br>from<br>Wellington initially in from Oakland<br>anything down to us today so thank you<br>very much resource for coming and<br>sharing the knowledge with us some of<br>the things that we're going to talk<br>about today we wouldn't be able to talk<br>about them Reese wasn't here whatever<br>they make Tamia to care for you oh my i<br>don't mind then of course mami but in<br>Maui's from here anyway so<br>then thank you mommy for still being<br>here to talk to us this morning<br>okay ah<br>so what we're going to do today is we're<br>going to talk about a thing called<br>vision motto donna i'm just going to<br>jump out of this slide and jump into<br>this slide here<br>and fire this button here so<br>three speakers to value myself maui in<br>wreaths<br>the topic of our talk is<br>incorporating vision marte longer and to<br>research<br>and we want to try and<br>spin it or twist that sites research<br>that's relevant to computer science or<br>to science in June<br>even though I note that the faculty of<br>science is giving a similar talk on<br>vision muttered I'm right now in the<br>next room so<br>later on in the week or next week when<br>the videos coming out I'm going to lay<br>down the video and have a look and see<br>who gave the bit at all<br>but I know else would be better<br>not being biased okay<br>so what we're going to do is<br>we're going to talk about vision<br>so<br>the reason that arm here staining and<br>front of you talking about the tomato<br>longer is because<br>for the last year or so I've been<br>helping out with one of the National<br>Science challenges so this a bunch of<br>National Science challenges they<br>give government funding to solve some<br>challenges throughout the country they<br>so we get 110 million over 10 years over<br>teen years 110 million to support<br>funding to solve a challenge now<br>particular challenges technology in its<br>technology that will enhance innovation<br>and lead to economic benefit both of me<br>so the purpose of their talents to<br>enhance New Zealand capacity to use<br>physical sciences in engineering for<br>economic growth<br>under 19 million I've 18 years to solve<br>big challenge<br>at the moment our challenge has broken<br>up into a number of portfolios we've got<br>a portfolio for innovation every culture<br>and barnum technologies<br>ooh actually these are some of the<br>different challenges note this is our<br>portfolio health medical technology<br>smart services materials manufacturing<br>processes and processors and<br>applications<br>so the government has given money to<br>solve these challenges<br>one of the important aspects of each of<br>these challenge is to address this thing<br>called vision motto don that<br>when they came to our challenge put him<br>in a bid for funding they decided that<br>the piece way to address this challenge<br>was to have a group specifically looking<br>at vision Mata Dona Ana group has known<br>as the car Grimaldi so a group of Mardi<br>researchers mounted Marty technologists<br>who have experience worth using<br>marty-mart Oh Donna and knee research<br>and I think mommy was quite understand<br>mental and making sure that our group<br>hit a car promoted you<br>so it's good that Marius here as well<br>after a bunch of meetings the car who<br>marty was kind of formed in then for<br>some reason I'm not quite sure why I was<br>asked to lead this group so I'm the<br>coyote of the chiro Marty for the<br>National Science challenge for<br>technology so that is the reason why I'm<br>here staining talking to you guys today<br>ok so that's a little bit about our<br>challenge what we're going to roll what<br>we're going to do this morning as a<br>going to head Reese come up and talk<br>first<br>so<br>romantic motor race might infer gyarmati<br> away so it's me and Mattie mitered<br>Connor appropriate that he thinking<br>eating a day because of the association<br>with kinetin and Latin writer so again<br>you're not really recent oh my her mind<br>ki y minus you don't feel about meeting<br>so he's going to talk about the vm<br>policy and a little bit about why was it<br>up<br>why it's important way for years and<br>years and years we could just do<br>research and not have to worry about<br>this thing for vm and then suddenly one<br>day when you we've got a simple<br>application for funding we have to have<br>a vm component so how did that happen<br>why did that happen so Reese is going to<br>talk a little bit about it we're going<br>to try and keep up to 20 minutes and i'm<br>going to talk about how we can<br>incorporate them into our research so<br>this is from the perspective I've got<br>some Richards really cool visit I want<br>to do now go to add a vm component how<br>can I do get what are some of the ideas<br>what are some of the strategies so I can<br>make my research proposal look really<br>cool so that i can get funding<br>one of the key things to be able to<br>integrate vm into your research as the<br>have that ability to engage with molding<br>so the third part of this talk is going<br>to be on about Marty engagement and<br>that's what now he's going to talk about<br>so the theory is<br>20 minutes on the V in policy 20 minutes<br>on how I can incorporate vm into my<br>particular research 20 minutes on how I<br>can engage with Marty with my research<br>then we're going to open it up for<br>questions and if anybody's got any<br>questions that's the time<br>and then it's us we're done<br>ok<br>ok so I'm going to do now is I'm going<br>to pass it over to Reese<br>thing mark why Reese the floors yours<br>O'Leary 6 plane has background because<br>it's so i want to say fast but there's<br>some so many different government<br>sectors that to be quite honest I<br>haven't really been able keep operating<br>within<br>180 this was a coup de la Morena tato<br>DeMarco tentative any other popular as<br>the tack isitri s'mores is my name I do<br>hail from these parts from naughty<br>naughty man who to here in finery and<br>that's cook yo night so he could I in t<br>Ottawa they tell me there's some naughty<br>Irish and naughty Welsh in there as well<br>I'm sure I could come up with some<br>politically incorrect bility James jokes<br>but I won't<br>but anyway look it's great to be here<br>thank you to Tucker and the team and<br>Omari and others for the invitation<br>I'm wearing a couple of hats here today<br>I work in the program office of the<br>National Science challenge science<br>technological innovation so to Tucker<br>and I work particularly closely and in<br>Molly's involved with that challenge as<br>well I've been around the new zealand<br>science system since about<br>2007 which is not that long actually<br>and work for those of you who have a few<br>gray hairs I have the same but I'm very<br>good at dying them in hiding them<br>but you'll remember organizations like<br>forced the foundation for research<br>science and technology which I was a<br>battle that then morphed into msi the<br>Ministry of Science and Innovation I<br>think that lasted about 16 months<br>then that sort of bits that went off to<br>Callaghan innovation which sort of<br>formed out of IRL industrial research<br>and bits of it in our way at the Rio<br>tido good at coaching and so and so<br>I've been around the science system for<br>a while mainly in the sort of Marty<br>development and muddy economic<br>development more recently and I was also<br>the inaugural head of MBS Marty economic<br>development unit I've been out of my own<br>for about the last a year and a half and<br>again contracting into<br>the National Science challenge as well<br>as supporting the faculty of engineering<br>at Oakland University around developing<br>a mighty engagement plan and I do a few<br>other things with the Ministry of<br>Foreign Affairs so Rodney Hide when he<br>was a member of parliament you to call<br>people like me a bro row correct some of<br>our mighty leadership called people like<br>me a state-owned Marty so whatever works<br>you can call me what you like so I'm<br>going to talk about the policy stuff<br>there's a bit of history there if you<br>want to know it you're very welcome I<br>had to to stop me i know'd attack has<br>already talked about having questions at<br>the end but they're Maui's this to me<br>people somebody forget the questions so<br>if you do want to stop me feel free<br>so visit mark todo now is a policy<br>framework which was developed way back<br>in about 2005<br>Professor Charles royal and many of you<br>will know was quite integral in<br>establishing it and he had an advisory<br>board supporting him in that role and<br>the policy framework is really about<br>unlocking the potential of Mardi<br>knowledge resources and people for the<br>benefit of all New Zealand that<br>frameworks pretty broad and it's<br>deliberately so<br>from sort of my take on it you can do<br>pretty much anything under the vision<br>market on a framework maybe except<br>building nuclear-powered aircraft<br>carrier but you never know but it's<br>deliberately very very broad as you may<br>also be aware these four things to<br>Tucker is going to touch on those later<br>but there's an indigenous innovation<br>thin at i/o and environmental theme a<br>holder or autumn at the well-being<br>health theme and of course mark<br>tottenham indigenous knowledge theme<br>around those and the original Morse<br>document that was developed as actually<br>still sitting on in bees website if you<br>wanted to go a never look so it's<br>acknowledging and I know I'm in many<br>cases preaching to an audience that<br>already knows this but Marty are sort of<br>intergenerational guardians of many of<br>our natural resources and<br>indigenous knowledge and so have much to<br>offer the science and innovation system<br>and that's what the government has<br>acknowledged through developing in<br>supporting this policy a lot of it too<br>is about building the Cape of bility not<br>only of Marty and mighty organizations<br>to engage with our science system but<br>how do we also build the capability of<br>our scientists in our researchers and<br>our engineers to work with money and so<br>for example mb currently runs a vision<br>marketing a capability fund deliberately<br>targeted at that the priorities of<br>researchers can be quite different to<br>the priorities of many Marty<br>organizations so how do you match those<br>right and we are or what is that what is<br>the win-win and that's what that's about<br>and of course vision march out on there<br>is also a response in terms of the<br>Crown's relationship with Marty through<br>the treaty but of course more so today<br>around the<br>maturing crown Marty relationship which<br>we see taking on sort of different forms<br>whether it be in the sort of co<br>management of key resources and assets<br>or Marty input into into policy<br>frameworks<br>so yeah bringing sort of vision marte<br>under to life<br>it's about sort of investing on the<br>resources but time into the science<br>that's important to Marty so it's really<br>important to understand what's sitting<br>behind and what are the motivations of<br>your typical if I can use that to Marty<br>organization Marty often talked about<br>having quadruple bottom line drivers so<br>often it's not just about the economic<br>it's about the social it's about the<br>environmental it's about the cultural<br>and other key drivers and the uniqueness<br>of a mighty organization is that they<br>have to operate in this these worlds<br>simultaneously now there are very few<br>entities in this country that have to do<br>them and so therefore if you understand<br>that what sits and drives are Marty<br>organization is working on multiple<br>fronts as a researcher when you're<br>approaching them you need to be aware of<br>the sorts of<br>sort of calls on the time of many Marty<br>leaders and Marty organizations they're<br>not just worried about one killer thing<br>we talk often about the sort of<br>intergenerational time frames there's<br>one particular chairman of a very<br>well-known Marty trust not far from here<br>who said he is planning for infinity<br>they have a board that are appointed for<br>life they have young people who rotate<br>through that board come in and out but<br>their core board is rotated for life and<br>when he says to me Reese we are planning<br>for infinity he means it this particular<br>organization Marty organization recently<br>about three years ago locked themselves<br>away in a room for a week and got local<br>and international<br>experts in to look at what sort of food<br>the world will be eating in 50 years<br>time and what do they need to do in<br>terms of gearing up their operation and<br>who are they need to partner with both<br>domestically and internationally to meet<br>that demand and when you're starting to<br>look at the sort of future of food in 50<br>years it's not just the conversations<br>not just about food it becomes about<br>water it becomes about geography it<br>becomes about geopolitical stuff so<br>understanding these sorts of time frames<br>understanding sort of thinking that goes<br>on within a marty organization that it<br>is not one-dimensional starts to give<br>you a bit of a sense really of<br>why mini Marty organizations not only<br>behave the way they do but why they tend<br>to be very very busy people and<br>so it's developing that sort of<br>capability to do that<br>and<br>where I have seen in the past again as a<br>as a as a state-owned Marty where this<br>has worked really really well is when<br>often a Mardi organization is the driver<br>was leading the conversation leading the<br>co Papa supported by the science system<br>and scientists and then government<br>playing its role whether that's within a<br>funding arrangement whether that<br>supporting in terms of you know changes<br>in regulation whether it's adapting<br>policies to suit that and I'll give you<br>one example it's a small example but I<br>think sort of gives a bit of a sense of<br>how this could work about five or six<br>years ago I was working for industrial<br>research limited one of the crown<br>research institutes and we were just<br>having discussions with NATO an idea who<br>apparently ever traditional plant called<br>terra mia which for many many hundreds<br>of years prior to European<br>New Zealand used to Ramirez a perfume a<br>cosmetic company knew about this later<br>who were very clever of 1995 they locked<br>up a lot of the intellectual property<br>associated with their flora and fauna<br>someone told me that Chris Finlayson was<br>one of the lawyers at the time is<br>currently the treaty negotiations<br>Minister<br>and they locked up the intellectual<br>property associated with some of their<br>traditional flora and fauna the cosmetic<br>company wanted to develop this telomere<br>perfume they knew they couldn't do it<br>without my Tahoe not only because the<br>access to the resource but the<br>intellectual property that note I had<br>but what I wanted to do before it went<br>into this arrangement is to understand<br>what the characteristics and composition<br>of the telomere plant woo and so they<br>approached Industrial Research get some<br>really smart extraction processes to<br>look at those characteristics so if this<br>was to become a commercial<br>product could it be upscaled what would<br>have to be adapted and so forth and so<br>forth so you had government in terms of<br>a crown Research Institute not only did<br>I bring some smart people to the table<br>but they bought some made to the table<br>you've ignited driving this in terms of<br>its commercial interest as well as<br>protecting its own sort of<br>Marco donor around this plant and a<br>commercial interest and I understand<br>that research is still up on the website<br>the other day and it still still<br>occurring so you've got this sort of<br>combination of these three components<br>which seem to be doing you know going<br>well but the difference is here is that<br>it's not a who which is one of the key<br>drivers and the driving seat because a<br>lot of it belongs to them so<br>so that's where you know I've seen it<br>I've seen it work quite well there are<br>other other examples I have seen it<br>worked fairly too by the way and we can<br>talk about their letter and so again<br>it's about sort of supporting sort of a<br>modding led approach to research okay um<br>it's not exclusively amarti thing by the<br>way in your work with industry it's<br>important that you know industry is<br>supported so you've got to find that<br>happy medium there happy relationship<br>collaborating with a number of agencies<br>unfortunately government has not set up<br>often to work with Marty organizations<br>because government departments in to<br>keep within their own portfolios so<br>trying to sort of see how the different<br>agencies Lincoln whether it's the<br>Ministry of Primary Industries or in B<br>or or whoever that's often a big<br>challenge so just being aware of that<br>some of you may be aware that a few<br>years ago the government and and<br>launched a crown Marty economic growth<br>partnership and strategy called her kk<br>approving of that strategy still as<br>relevant today it goes out to about 2040<br>there's a number of government agencies<br>are working on different programs around<br>that I'd encourage you to have a look at<br>that strategy only because it gives you<br>a sense the mighty economic task force<br>helped develop that alongside number of<br>government departments but it gives you<br>a bit of a sense of sort of the modern<br>in emerging Mario Khanna me and its<br>influence today and what its priorities<br>might be and so as researchers many of<br>you may want to get some better<br>understanding of that<br>you'll know that probably the regional<br>partner network business partner network<br>for example supported both by New<br>Zealand trade and enterprise and<br>Callaghan innovation sets out here and I<br>think it's at the innovation park here<br>the local one and they're able to often<br>offer some support to some Marty<br>organizations<br>and you can tell Marlee Hudson held the<br>pen on our presentation because he's<br>using words like investment signals goes<br>so how long you been around the system<br>mate so what yeah yeah many of you I<br>know probably engaged with mb on funding<br>applications and different things you<br>will know that<br>vision Marco donor is now not an<br>optional extra it has been<br>factory-fitted and to tuck has asked me<br>to talk a little bit about that so in<br>2005 when it was developed there was a<br>little pot of money I think was about<br>six million dollars at the time put a<br>sign for vision market under activities<br>at the time though the whole science<br>system had about 750 million dollars in<br>it and I was around the system at the<br>time and multi researchers used to<br>always have to go and fight for this<br>little pot of six million dollars and<br>there's another 700 million dollars<br>sitting near so we realized<br>at the time that this wasn't my work<br>shall I draw my little do you think<br>that's interesting ok ok I think this is<br>boring to some of you but for policy<br>walks like me means something but just a<br>bit history so in<br>2009 way map who is the science Minister<br>before the current one Steven Joyce came<br>into the portfolio and it will hold up<br>Fox of money all over the show and he<br>wanted to get a bit of a sense of where<br>it was and so basically<br>the Ministry of the time sort of gave<br>them an idea for example and I can't<br>remember exactly but you know biological<br>industries could have had so much many<br>millions of dollars here energy my head<br>so many millions dollars here<br>manufacturing<br>etc so many millions of dollars and then<br>there were a few things in the middle<br>and one of those thin lives vision mart<br>i don't know if i see that has said<br>about six million dollars in which about<br>half within those days used to go to<br>hrc benefits still case and there are<br>few sort of little reticent mice so much<br>so this big thing represented at the<br>time out 750 million i think the science<br>votes just over a billion now are close<br>to it and as I see it there was this<br>little pot of vision market and the<br>money and it used to sit on me on the<br>side and if those researchers have been<br>around a while you either opted for<br>vision matter than where you didn't and<br>sometimes it helped you sometimes it<br>didn't so a few of us bureaucrats got<br>around the table and said holla and how<br>do we make sure that vision multi-donor<br>is captured through the rest of of the<br>dollars and change the diagram literally<br>change the diagram and<br>if the whole division Montoto that can<br>applied correctly apply to all those<br>areas and in fact if anything move can<br>potentially move in and out<br>manufacturing maybe it's not as strongly<br>as for example in in biological<br>industries or environment for example<br>we're in health just depends right on<br>what the coke up it might be and so and<br>shifted and so we went to the minister<br>at the time about half a dozen of us and<br>said Minister we think vision maradona<br>should be integrated across the system<br>and we were worried because we thought<br>we might get one or the other so the<br>minister might decide to take the six<br>million dollars spread around to keep<br>that or say know this all too hard we'll<br>just leave that fortunately Minister map<br>probably didn't know what he was signing<br>up to at the time but he decided to keep<br>both of them and so today vision<br>multi-donor is integrated across the<br>whole system and that's why<br>unfortunately or fortunately however you<br>wish to take this now you have to<br>address it in in your in your<br>applications for funding particularly<br>through the MBE system and I think over<br>time and that was done as i said in 2009<br>fortunately over time<br>mb itself is starting to get a little<br>bit more sophisticated in the way that<br>it does this you'll notice that there<br>are on some of the assessment panels<br>they're experts on vision maradona so we<br>can't escape it and that's a good thing<br>because vision martin and really adds<br>value I believe to to what we do and the<br>research that occurs so addressing and<br>proposals is really important and Tucker<br>and Maui will talk more about this but<br>early engagement is important getting<br>that understanding of what the<br>priorities of a particular Marty<br>organization that you might be working<br>with with it a bit and he we level the<br>upper level a far no level or<br>incorporation or trust level really<br>really important to start to have that<br>engagement think about vision martyr and<br>a very early on in your project even if<br>your science or your research today it's<br>not obvious it may become obvious not<br>only if there are changes not any new<br>research but as we see this as I say<br>this more the more sort of influence of<br>the emerging Marty economy that might<br>change I'll give you an example<br>wearing another hat that I wear with the<br>faculty of engineering at Auckland<br>University I had a researcher come to me<br>who developed some very high tech<br>bonding material that bonds worth with<br>steel for example<br>will extend the life of that steel<br>and he said look you know is there is<br>there a vm component to this now I'm not<br>a scientist my qualifications exit<br>political science but that helps when<br>you work and Wellington without people<br>to it's very helpful but but I<br>said to him there is no obvious connect<br>right now however many Marty<br>organizations today are big investors<br>and property many Marty are building<br>buildings that they want to last for<br>more than just three years or more than<br>just five years and again I'll refer to<br>the chairman of that trust is talking<br>about it infiniti the beautiful funnier<br>that for example two who have defied<br>almighty i think it's called and they<br>want that to last for a long long time<br>and so Marty because Marty have this<br>longer will view they will want their<br>buildings to last longer so this<br>material may become quite important for<br>them going forward and so I said to him<br>think about your research think about<br>the the support that vision martyrdom<br>could play in your research going<br>forward<br>and and start to think and talk about<br>now in your project planning how you put<br>your resources aside whether you need to<br>put some of budget aside for having qui<br>for for supporting Marty researchers to<br>be able to work with you and so that's<br>just a small example<br>um Marsden again Maui is probably better<br>place to talk a little bit about this<br>many of you will know this a lot of this<br>is the same sort of thing that I've just<br>been talking about I'm not particularly<br>close to what Marsden does but I<br>understand royal society are starting to<br>gear up more and more now with vision<br>maradona is some then the semester on<br>their board she isn't she so they've got<br>some good advice to you and becoming a<br>bit more sophisticated in the way that<br>they implement<br>implement vision motto dinner<br>that's it i'm happy to wait to the end<br>for questions do you want to do that<br>could you buy anything ok couple okay so<br>thank you very much and we'll talk to<br>ok our turkey and everybody<br>cerise is kind of talk like from a<br>policy perspective and what I want to<br>talk now is kind of from the perspective<br>of a researcher<br>and Reese mentioned that the ideal way<br>to do it as before we start our<br>researched to engage with Marty I know<br>what is important to my tea how can you<br>know we find some research that can help<br>Marty but the reality is as most of the<br>researchers<br>Sydney and Jean Brock may be an Ian if<br>Brock as well don't kind of work that<br>way it's here's the little bit of<br>science that on my chest and this is<br>what<br>turns me on this is what makes me get up<br>in the morning and trying research<br>something we do all of this research<br>that's really interesting then we look<br>okay I want to apply for some funding I<br>have to put this VM component how can I<br>do that so that's kind of what I want to<br>talk about in the next 20 minutes or so<br>ok so I'm did some research and i'm<br>filling out an application for funding<br>and there's this question what is the vm<br>components i have a good think about my<br>research there's no vm component so i<br>just write that vm does not apply here<br>my response to that is<br>research that doesn't have a vm<br>component does not exist I thank you<br>what kind of research you are doing I<br>don't care how abstract it is how<br>insignificant you think it is to Mardi<br>or to the world we can make it have a vm<br>components ok we can work it so V and<br>can apply<br>how do we do that well that's what i<br>want to show you in the next 15 minutes<br>or so<br>i dearly so we just don't have immune<br>component to what I'm saying they all<br>research no matter which field we're<br>working in can be aligned to vm can't be<br>aligned to envision lotto diamond<br>may not be obvious we will for them<br>but with some<br>abstract thinking maybe weekend and we<br>should find opportunities so that when<br>we fill out that application we can say<br>yes we do have a vm component<br>okay so traditionally there's four<br>not traditions through both historically<br>it is for vm research things<br>there's a vm research theme on<br>indigenous innovation and this is about<br>using science to improve specifically<br>Mardi economic growth<br>there is a vm research theme on the tile<br>and the environments how can my research<br>use my body knowledge of that<br>environment use the relationship that<br>Marty has with an environment to improve<br>that environment the vm theme on how<br>order in or honor so how can I research<br>and three the health of Maori because<br>generally Marty have poor health as<br>compared to non Modi so if I'm doing<br>some research that's improving people's<br>health it's got to be good for Mulder<br>because they are only the ones that need<br>it the most how can improve their health<br>how can I improve their social<br>well-being<br>so generally Marty out the lower social<br>class so if my research can improve<br>people's social class Edina must be<br>relevant to Marty<br>and in the fourth thing the fourth theme<br>is a research team on Marco donor<br>how can we use traditional Marty to be<br>incorporated into my research for a<br>better result<br>and this is kind of so the research that<br>I personally do this around el maadi so<br>if I'm wanting to apply a vm theme on my<br>personal message the number four is the<br>angle i go because i'm improving i'm<br>using my<br>maldi i'm using terrell marty and the<br>interfaces that will build you<br>so just take a net example and working<br>it a little bit more if I'm a computer<br>scientist and I'm working on HDI<br>human-computer interfaces in a fight<br>incorporates a vm component into my<br>interface I can do that by thinking<br>about how come on interface we've not<br>only in English but also a multi so if I<br>work some English in at work son Mario<br>if I can build my interface said it can<br>handle two languages then it can also<br>easily be adapted to work in German or<br>Chinese or a whole bunch of other<br>languages so by incorporating vm into my<br>my particular interface I've improved my<br>interface and are made at worldwide<br>applicable so that's an example of how<br>vm can improve the research that we're<br>doing so these are the four traditional<br>things<br>these four themes address<br>research that's important to Marty that<br>the researcher children can have one of<br>these four things quite well in it's<br>important to margin that comes under<br>vision muttered on the research<br>this research that's involved deeply<br>within these void areas as research that<br>XD Marty wants actually Marty need ok<br>it's not I've got this really cool idea<br>how can I find some researchers more the<br>other way around we have some issues<br>here's some research that you can do to<br>help our issues so it's not research<br>that's been applied to Marty its<br>research that Marty are asking for<br>every citizen go gators Mario from the<br>conceptual stage and beyond so a lot of<br>research that happens is we come up with<br>the idea or we tell them some ideas we<br>come up with something we think as a<br>much better we want to further develop<br>and then let's go and talk to someone<br>about it it's much better<br>research and it's also much better for a<br>vm thing as before you come up with that<br>idea you're going to talk to Marty<br>say kind of what kind of things what<br>here is a you licking we you need help<br>what could we possibly do as the<br>department is a researcher that would<br>help you and if you start that<br>engagement before you start the research<br>then it's much better form a V in<br>perspective much more applicable you get<br>a higher VA rating basically<br>so if you can do any of these things<br>quite well then it's great vm research<br>and when you're filling out the vm<br>section on your application and works<br>really well<br>most of the stuff like I set myself the<br>research that happens and G block and if<br>block and any block some of these other<br>blocks around this university don't work<br>that way ok let's kind of not the<br>thinking of researchers at the moment ok<br>so<br>pretending that's our case pretending we<br>haven't had the opportunity to think<br>about the problem first and then design<br>the research pretending that will prove<br>our research now we are applying for<br>funding we're going to take this but on<br>the end how do we do that ok so I'll<br>want to give you some tips some<br>approaches that you can incorporate vm<br>into your application thing here is to<br>apply vm step number one or what area<br>number one so an important part of vm<br>vision muttering that is to increase<br>model capacity so develop Maori<br>researchers into our research<br>this is the area that no matter what<br>kind of science what kind of technology<br>what kind of research we're doing this<br>is the area that we can apply<br>our he any modern researchers all Mardi<br>entities working on my particular field<br>hey<br>chances are quite high and a few hours<br>ok so if the ads great now I've got that<br>ability to increase motor capacity let's<br>try and get some let's put out<br>scholarship so let's put out invitations<br>can we do tell Marty researchers Marty<br>post grade students under great students<br>working on us uriel science can we<br>encourage the money<br>reality is there's probably not very<br>students there yet but if we keep<br>advertising of the keep my opportunities<br>available they will start to come in I<br>believe they will start to come in and<br>once they start coming on even if we<br>just get one we have 20 people on your<br>research team one of them so Marty now<br>we can start saying i'm applying being<br>to my research<br>if we do happen to have one the net to<br>start how can we get another one how can<br>we get this Marty to influence other<br>motor people that email to get them to<br>come in and do this particular research<br>area that we're working on<br>some of the Mardi that we have<br>researching or working with in our<br>research areas do not have very much<br>experience with the emotive backgrounds<br>that's okay no it's fine the fact that<br>they have a Papa marty is enough i<br>affected their Papa my dears<br>enough because they have the opportunity<br>somewhere in their lifetime to chase<br>after their property looking<br>after their proper proper proper start<br>getting those links big<br>providing that have gone troppo papa<br>mali thou Marty researcher if we can<br>employ them or get them interested in<br>our research this is an aerial being<br>with them to court if you can't do all<br>these other areas that are applied<br>everybody doing any message can you can<br>look to increase martin capacity in the<br>research ok so this is very number one<br>area number two line mark total maldives<br>mataram ahmadi is traditional mighty<br>knowledge so the question is can<br>additional knowledge be used in my<br>research and<br>most of the time for the research that<br>we're doing will quickly answer no it<br>can nothing about Marta longer Marty<br>I'd like to say maybe a kind right now<br>maybe and some of the spindles maybe in<br>some of the applications it can be they<br>say I'm saying don't say no just say<br>maybe not yet<br>shua<br>to be honest a lot of our traditional<br>multi knowledge is difficult to get<br>these days because a lot of it has faded<br>but if you're interested enough in my<br>foot determine enough a lot of it can be<br>refound<br>gain my total reminder be used in our<br>research yes can I safely tip into this<br>so I don't want to go bounding in and<br>give me the matter on the motor visit I<br>could put in my recipe so I can help you<br>get what steps do I take to enable that<br>marley knowledge to be involved in my<br>research and I think mommy might talk<br>about because this is more about Marty<br>engagement F&amp;I have you ticked I mean<br>really tick that it doesn't involved if<br>you're unsure you can I take with who<br>can i find it's got some kind of<br>knowledge about how some possibility of<br>my total almighty can be used in my<br>research<br>and it's often who can I ask you can ask<br>someone that you can ask someone kind of<br>here you go down electric so can I find<br>the new model researchers look Lena my<br>technology can be applied<br>area number three<br>utilizing modeling resources k Marty<br>uses the mighty resources be used in my<br>research<br>it's not like we want to abuse and<br>blatantly use but can they be invited<br>into this research<br>it was a researcher there was doing some<br>research on kb ok so that's fine to do<br>researching on caving we have some very<br>interesting caves ourselves on Marty in<br>a place for white or more maybe those<br>particular researchers should approach<br>some of these people are lateral and say<br>I'm doing this kind of research are you<br>interested maybe we could work together<br>and maybe<br>the research can provide something<br>that's quite interesting to you so can<br>we use our lens can we use our<br>environments as the any type of<br>particular multi communities that could<br>be used<br>and some thinking of a new computer<br>science of existing some of our products<br>can we get my own communities involved<br>in the testing as well as non Marty<br>communities as the emerging industries<br>that are interested in this particular<br>research as their particular model<br>people<br>can we test Marty language can meet is<br>Marty takuna and the research that we're<br>doing<br>so area number three that maybe I can<br>apply some aspect of the able to my<br>research and<br>if I can't<br>but I listed saying that I'm thinking<br>about it that's almost as good<br>when I'm looking at an application<br>one two three are<br>utilizing Marty people so kind of see<br>that person here a little bit<br>utilizing my resources my do people are<br>excellent resource but more specifically<br>rd e Marley people all Mardi entities<br>aside from the researchers that we<br>talked about an option one that could be<br>involved for example from doing research<br>on student strains of flex can I get the<br>Mardi the New Zealand Maori flicks<br>Weaver's Association involved in my<br>research can I talk to those guys and<br>say those are some research we're doing<br>are you guys interested and being<br>involved ok so can we go to national<br>organizations or maybe we could go to<br>local organizations locally we they<br>might be involved in the research on<br>doing maybe I'm looking at water quality<br>so from doing research on water quality<br>world this is the area of whether to buy<br>capsules named after the river maybe<br>also talk to some of the people involved<br>with cleaning up the river<br>canoe is another immediate has a river<br>running to it later i'm quite interested<br>in research and water so maybe i can<br>apply my research or talk to these<br>people in these river the river people<br>asking if the research is interesting to<br>them can we work together to do research<br>that benefits both of us I<br>improving the market economy so these<br>initial research interactions these are<br>kind of 12 my research has built what<br>are some of the outcomes can some of<br>these outcomes affect market economies<br>so maybe i'm looking at a certain type<br>of tree and the development they tree or<br>summed up some spinosa with a tree long<br>to me I come it's going to increase its<br>kinda a fit the friar street industry we<br>have some vapor multiplayers in the<br>forestry industry there are probably<br>quite interested in the research that<br>I'm doing<br>so long term and long term outcomes of<br>effect modelling economies at the<br>almighty businesses Miley organizations<br>working in this area that will be<br>interested in my research so one two<br>three four five areas so I can the roof<br>to apply vm unto my research and I don't<br>care what the researchers I don't care<br>what the researchers you can have a look<br>and see if these areas can be applied<br>into your research and<br>once he has 6 i'm pretty sure just the<br>fire the fire<br>okay<br>here's another way of looking at it hey<br>I've got a recent project I need to<br>think about vision lantern on with my<br>research project so who can I talk about<br>my project to key and I consider my name<br>relevance or infect into my project<br>how can I plan to include a multi<br>researcher into my research<br>there's the recognized mode entity there<br>could be involved with this research how<br>come I tweaked my design a little bit to<br>apply to Marty and then how can I look<br>for those long-term outcomes a<br>shorter bunch of skips how come I dress<br>the vm component on my research<br>okay so that wasn't like the main thing<br>I wanted to talk about I wanted to<br>quickly talk about so at the science for<br>technology innovation challenge<br>the challenge has done I think a lot of<br>what's the word out<br>really great forward-thinking<br>work and regards to the vision motto<br>Donna<br>when before this damage was set up so i<br>went to some of the three times and<br>meetings they was talking about this<br>thing called Calgary Marty I was<br>thinking to myself you know you do i<br>really want to be involved with this but<br>the more I listened to the attitude of<br>the people running their talents the<br>more I thought to myself these guys are<br>taking this quite seriously<br>these guys have got a real<br>chance to really incorporate vision<br>matalan into this challenge and that's<br>why I decided yes I want it to be a part<br>of it<br>ok and our times we have five portfolios<br>in four things each of those things and<br>each of those portfolios are committed<br>to incorporating vision muttered on the<br>entity research it's one of the themes<br>as visual mattered on that but isn't the<br>case that visual matter on the goes to<br>all of those other themes on portfolios<br>and sees can you put vm into your<br>research I works the other way around<br>those are other themes and there's other<br>portfolios come back to us and they say<br>how can we do it we can we put it who<br>can i contact to get this happen so the<br>VMS pectin are challenges that's real<br>good i believe really great your degree<br>recently we announced some c funding say<br>a seed funding is for three year three<br>year projects<br>there was a poor or funny that we are<br>able to support and it worked out so<br>what happened<br>before the applications we now before<br>the request for proposals will not as a<br>challenge the challenge decidedly twenty<br>percent of all the applicants that would<br>be funded would be V in related research<br>so vm it's not tekton but vm primarily<br>talking with Marty and going through one<br>of those four things that I talked about<br>earlier so people got to apply for this<br>funding<br>and they got to select which area are<br>they apply and is it a vm related<br>research was at hyvee humilated research<br>so you might be judges we got all the<br>applications together and we put all the<br>implications that will add a high vm<br>component we did actually took the box<br>online we've got them all into one pool<br>and put all the other proposals into<br>another pool and then we read through it<br>and all of the applications they were<br>good enough but made it into this<br>allocation pool and in what we did was<br>we decided that most of the application<br>through around<br>hundred thousand a year we've got a<br>million dollars to giving out so i'm<br>going to have teen implications teen<br>implications are going to be successful<br>two of those applications are going to<br>come from the vm for the rest of the<br>implications are going to come from the<br>it worked out that theah we're not sure<br>I can see this information<br>excuse me if I can see this information<br>again eternally okay get more than<br>twenty percent they were yeah a fund of<br>it twenty-seven percent of the emulators<br>so we had to pause that makes that be<br>roughly ten pound to Fong here in a full<br>year of<br>the ones above really high quality I<br>think we ended up with the Sweeney India<br>and so what we did is we we do remember<br>hair actually and we physically got a<br>hit so all of these for a good enough to<br>be funded in this challenge its seed<br>funding and mean we just talked to go<br>out of a hit we looked at as other to<br>do they both identical enough to go into<br>this pool one of them was<br>after a couple of hours the grave<br>one of them wasn't mean we I think it<br>might have been my stubble and here as<br>well 15 16 maybe 20 20 applicants they<br>made attorney and but they'd head out<br>again draw all of these applicants out<br>again and one of them actually was the<br>one from this morning so our objective<br>to find twenty percent of vision matter<br>moment implications was actually higher<br>there's more to you still serving yeah<br>so it was more like yeah an extra one so<br>their numbers research protein out by<br>dollar<br>they don't implications focused on Marty<br>soon when I looked through some my role<br>must look to all of these 80<br>applications and decide how many address<br>via really well and can really didn't<br>and in general flippers a few of the<br>applications focused on Marty<br>vm really well a third of them consented<br>some things and then I through the<br>application seen this is not relevant to<br>morning okay and so when they say this<br>is not relevant to my own back you<br>really need to think again and look at<br>being or so that we've funded again went<br>back and I<br>wrote some comments shortcomings to the<br>funders are to the applicants saying<br>here's what we think how well you've<br>dressed a vision mutter under component<br>and given it we've got a couple of<br>minutes I want to read out some of them<br>because this is what from a funding<br>perspective this is kind of what we're<br>looking for<br>okay so i'm not going to read them all<br>out here's a couple of examples this<br>proposal stated as aligned the theme and<br>looks to build and sustain relationships<br>and communication to local Marty the<br>state's engagement will occur with this<br>particular organization which appears to<br>be from the new based entity many of the<br>research assistant instance to undertake<br>Marty engagement there's a suggestion<br>that appears these student could be<br>Marty<br>vm opportunities been overlooked called<br>Marty engagement occur only in this<br>research and not be something ticked on<br>at the end cut a mighty PhD student be<br>more actively sought good engagement in<br>some specifically early engagement occur<br>with other Marty health organizations so<br>that was a funded application that<br>didn't really address them very well<br>he is one had addressed it quite well<br>and so so our response was significant<br>mode engagement in early stages of the<br>project aspects of mozzarella Marty to<br>be investigated we were possible<br>incorporated into research design<br>research the benefit Maori directly<br>opportunity stated there will increase<br>multi capacity no predictions year on<br>how this could impact multi economies so<br>those are some of the things we're<br>looking for<br>and in finally here's one it didn't do<br>so well<br>possible long-term applications of this<br>technology to Marty have been considered<br>opportunities have been nice to<br>encourage Marty researches into this<br>field I'm already introduced into the<br>discussion around science<br>so<br>there are<br>researchers who are submitting<br>applications who could do a much better<br>job I feel on this component and even<br>know me they could do much good at all<br>ideally what we'd like to do is give<br>most of our research applications and<br>she does pool as well as this pool<br>because then we get two shots at the<br>money<br>basically<br>okay<br>so one of the important parts of<br>vm has been able to engage with Marty so<br>they leave us nicely into the next<br>section<br>okay all right I haven't just stood up<br>here and there's someone leaving already<br>Oh<br>anyways so she must have liked the whole<br>engagement corridor the so so ask him a<br>question what does if you get engaged<br>what does it then normally lead to<br>hey marriage so it's usually an<br>intention to form a partnership so<br>there's there's this quote which is<br>probably a little bit inappropriate but<br>I'll say it anyway which is actually I'm<br>Marty leaders say they said engagement<br>should lead to marriage otherwise it's<br>just screwing and and I think part of my<br>so part of my role in there and this<br>challenge has been as a researcher in a<br>couple of places one of the animation<br>theme and one in an agricultural<br>environmental technologies part and<br>I'll talk a little bit about that and<br>but i think my history has been a little<br>bit probably being like i was trying to<br>work out whether it was the marriage<br>guidance counselor or the matchmaker and<br>i think it's probably the matchmaker<br>because you're trying to get people to<br>come together and for projects and you<br>only the marriage guidance counselor<br>when it starts to unravel and fall apart<br>let's see why pushing the Sun this one<br>this won't I can't you just say<br>okay there that and<br>you wouldn't know I definitely hearing<br>yeah yeah so as part of this as part of<br>the science challenge there's an one of<br>the things are really interesting and<br>you know we're talking about vision<br>barcoding and particularly and how you<br>kind of get across that different<br>culture that exists and work across it<br>but one of the things the challenge is<br>really interested up to is actually the<br>culture exists between<br>researchers and there in the Science<br>Space and in the business community and<br>so being able to drive innovation into<br>that economic growth space what are the<br>different things there and form or of<br>interest to you as the scientist and<br>your drivers this is what are the<br>drivers for the business community<br>because they have done kind of culture<br>and trying to make sure that those<br>things that you can kind of come to a<br>happy medium around the things that<br>you're going to work on and things that<br>they're going to work on and what gets<br>prioritized is really important and this<br>whole conversation that to tuk has been<br>talking about is exactly the same thing<br>but with the Maori culture so with a<br>tamale entity what are their drivers<br>what are the things that they're<br>interested in and how do they line up<br>for the things that you're doing so well<br>we get the mix of those things together<br>we've kind of got a multi but assigns a<br>bit and a business that which are now<br>three different sorts of cultures or<br>ways of operating which you are having<br>to kind of juggle all or bounce across<br>and<br>that s what in the context of the<br>project we're tryna we're trying to<br>think about what innovation park and<br>this is partly how they're thinking<br>about it is that there's different sorts<br>of capacities that people have to have<br>or you have to build within your team to<br>allow these things to happen so it's not<br>trying to make people you know kind of a<br>cutting cookie cutter and make everyone<br>the same but in the context of your team<br>you need people that can operate in<br>these different spaces<br>who can you work with that can engage<br>engage with their companies around the<br>sorts of things that are interested in<br>and the things that are challenges for<br>them which then you can actually apply<br>some of your technical expertise to what<br>are some of interest in the modding<br>community 32 discussions within that you<br>can kind of bring anything those things<br>align so<br>they've been talking about this need to<br>develop the relationship skills within<br>research teams<br>also the technical knowledge coming back<br>through different sorts of partnerships<br>and collaborations and also the human<br>innovation component if we were thinking<br>about that in the Marty sense on this<br>side here there's these three different<br>kind of ways it could or three different<br>words that could apply there which you<br>may have heard my colleagues talking<br>about so in terms of the things that<br>Marty interest and is usually a co cover<br>so what's the thing that's important to<br>them and how that kind of line so how<br>does that live and<br>T comer at least in terms of the<br>relationship and how do you develop<br>those relationships in ways that<br>everyone is comfortable and I love kind<br>of like the dating rules and the motto<br>donor so what sorts of information and<br>things like they have that can be<br>brought to bear in a technical sense in<br>so I just want to sleep over some of<br>these things but does a lot of its being<br>talked about<br>by attacking honorees similarly in terms<br>of you know who you can talk to ok<br>let's sort of stand here and talk about<br>how you just engagement party and<br>it's not like just this big kind of blob<br>of that I don't know fifteen percent of<br>us that of all he can pick any point and<br>that's going to be sort of the right so<br>there's you know a range of different<br>entities just in the same way as and<br>your kind of discipline or field there's<br>a whole lot of different people you<br>could choose the weapon and some of them<br>you'll like and some of them you won't<br>like all sorts of reasons and whether<br>it's been experience or just stuff you<br>did but<br>it's trying to think about what is most<br>appropriate for what we're talking about<br>and often it's a sort of a spiraling out<br>thing particular if you're working in an<br>area or moving into a field which you<br>don't have a lot of knowledge<br>you've got to find someone who can kind<br>of okay who do I know that knows someone<br>who can they give me a sort of a bit of<br>advice around who to talk to and sort of<br>you know follow your nose in that way<br>and at least hear some of those places<br>might be the research office and<br>who can who can kind of guide around<br>there or people that are sitting within<br>the faculties I'm to Tucker here or<br>going across to them<br>heckle to your mind Indigenous Studies I<br>think I'm allowed to call it that now<br>the<br>school just up here and looking for<br>people that can give you a better a<br>though I put the slide up because it's<br>the different language that people speak<br>so Sam I'm going on and talking to a<br>sort of night a group or community and<br>never put a most pack and understand<br>things if I start talking to them with<br>this language now if I go in and start<br>talking to them about these things okay<br>huh<br>and so this is you know this is kind of<br>part of the thing part of the challenge<br>and in generating their conversation<br>and what you can talk about so<br>you're the expert a fuel the expert in<br>the science and you're going to talk<br>with people that aren't experts in the<br>science it's really hard to have been<br>discussion around what with the<br>relevance ins you know it's got out<br>you're going to kind of elevate the<br>conversation and get involved and what<br>is the purpose and how the purpose can<br>be online<br>what sorts of things people might be<br>wanting to talk about<br>these are these are things that come out<br>of a sort of a Mardi research space<br>there's a lot of conversations about<br>better ways of operating and a lot of<br>conversation about the early engagement<br>in to enter project so<br>the community up model was some of the<br>work that Linda Smith had been involved<br>in and just talking about this is sort<br>of kind of values of ways of operating<br>that their researchers that have when<br>they're engaging with communities and<br>for the most part that's all about<br>developing a relationship because<br>there's going to be something else that<br>carries on you know if you're consulting<br>and<br>if you're just consulting and trying to<br>get a view then you don't really care<br>after you've got their view what happens<br>if you are engaging because you're<br>expecting is going to be some kind of<br>partnership you approach it in a<br>different way because you know that<br>there's important and being able to<br>maintain communication or not because<br>people off ensure you get to go out on a<br>second date<br>all of those sorts of things so those<br>are some of that kind of guides that<br>they guidance which I've given the top<br>part comes out of some work we did<br>around Marty ethical framework and a<br>little before areas are generally based<br>around those questions there so we can<br>talk to anyone and this could probably<br>be a company if you're you know if<br>you're going into places cold they're<br>going to want to know or houses project<br>come about you know it's not just I<br>that's a great idea this go with its ok<br>we're not a little bit of last year why<br>is it important why is it interest to us<br>and who's in charge<br>how robust is your methods or so if<br>you're having that conversation about<br>purpose this is what we intend to do I<br>can t you know that you're actually<br>going to be able to do it<br>and<br>then who's looking up for people's<br>interest so when we sign up and say okay<br>we're we're along for this ride how do<br>we know we're not going to get kind of<br>pushed out the bus halfway done that<br>kind of along the along the track<br>and so all these ideas about guidance<br>come out so his his another one which<br>we've been looking at at least in terms<br>of genomic research so we've done a<br>project thinking about<br>storage of human tissue future research<br>and how that gets used in big<br>tournaments projects and what are the<br>sorts of things that you might need to<br>talk about at different stages so<br>building off that same kind of framework<br>and a consultation fees there's going to<br>be a lot of conversation about okay<br>what's this about what's a purpose what<br>are the benefits and<br>how's the governance around this<br>arrangement going to work and one of our<br>principles for sort of working together<br>and<br>as you kind of then get it down onto the<br>research itself becomes more operational<br>you know look how things that I pray<br>what are the practices of sorts of<br>methods what sort of communication all<br>of those sorts of things that they're<br>usually interested in what happens after<br>the project so people don't sign up for<br>the research if they're not researchers<br>we sign up for the research because<br>we're going to get some funding to kind<br>of help us keep going but the people<br>that are partnering in this signing up<br>for that outcome and the outcome happens<br>after the research is finished so<br>how do we stay involved in that power<br>how do we help facilitate that part<br>happening ends up then a real and pull<br>up up because usually when the marriage<br>guidance counselor has to come in<br>there's kind of around here<br>because this is where we decide actually<br>we prefer this other girl free<br>just to cease to prettier she's kind of<br>such sort of about here<br>maybe a few less miles on the clock<br>anyway and we've got our other we put<br>our other project to work on and then<br>these guys are kind of like hanging with<br>their am I don't know marriage<br>certificate the report whatever that<br>sort of the reason you sharpen it so<br>and this this becomes part of that kind<br>of partnering collaboration thing again<br>because it might not be you yourself<br>that can do this if you might be able to<br>facilitate the conversations or things i<br>so<br>we're kind of talking a little bit about<br>you know what sorts of involvement there<br>might be on projects and terms at least<br>the vm component and at one stage it's<br>this whole idea of how much of it is<br>just about how much of the project is<br>just about centered on your interest and<br>how much a carnal can shift around these<br>spaces so<br>getting a bit of a vm tech you can do it<br>with just having someone involved in<br>your project so that's you know you're<br>essentially your project your idea<br>that's got as kind of focus about having<br>the molly capacity whether it's a<br>student or a researcher and supporting<br>that you might have a within that kind<br>of frame a specific project<br>both of naughty sort of sub project that<br>still sits within that same kind of<br>arena or you might shift to something<br>where you can partner with someone where<br>it sort of lines up with what you're<br>doing not directly you know you can work<br>together on some things on some kind of<br>shared outcomes but it's probably not<br>your kind of primary wonderful project<br>and then there's other ones where<br>actually your resourcing a component<br>that might be helping with the<br>transformation<br>so in some ways it's a separate project<br>but it's supporting kind of the end<br>outcome and I got just a couple of<br>little examples here to try and show how<br>the pen so this is one of those signs<br>challenge projects it's the one that's<br>funded through their agricultural and<br>environmental technologies and<br>it's this new research team led out a<br>link integrity where they've pulled<br>scientists who they can work with the<br>fall together to do something which I<br>really don't understand other than its<br>around<br>I've been able to measure the currents<br>generated from<br>magnetics related to water moving<br>through the ground of getting some nods<br>so kind of right hand but it's so and<br>it's something to do with trying to<br>measure their minut<br>amounts of for our current<br>amongst all the other noise and kind of<br>things that sit there so they're doing<br>this for you know for this project and<br>one level it's about the challenge is a<br>real technical one on a scientific point<br>of you and they're trying to build that<br>capacity and create new capacities by<br>bringing these different kind of things<br>together the beam component for this is<br>kind of aligned in a way because it's<br>actually about can we work with groups<br>to<br>visualize aspects of the amount owed on<br>it and this is around environmental<br>environmental knowledge so can we put<br>that in a sort of a GIS layer which can<br>then be visualized alongside other<br>layers or other science information and<br>a kind of a connect here is that<br>well so there's a couple of its one is<br>lint integrity is developing a<br>relationship with the local<br>local tribal locally we so that when<br>they win enough they develop their realm<br>since our measurement tool they can go<br>and test that around lake white holder<br>and see how long you know how close are<br>kind of going their way<br>so they've got this kind of relationship<br>Pat dear we're also working with them<br>that we are<br>if they would have come to the Eyrie at<br>the end and just say here's some data<br>about groundwater flow they're going to<br>be like that<br>wasn't a very exciting thing you know<br>it's kind of a little bit disappointed<br>so<br>they've bought into their dinner the<br>whole research team has bought into the<br>idea that we can work with them around<br>how they might put their information<br>together and get access to other sorts<br>of data so that they could look at the<br>ground flow information alongside those<br>things that way it makes kind of makes<br>more sense how some kind of understand<br>here's another one<br>windsor ambiguous results women<br>excellent DC<br>next week week after<br>this is this is oneness and a proposal<br>stage at the moment so it's food<br>research or the gene editing technology<br>crisper case my stamp you might have<br>heard about it in the papers and<br>is a team that wants to start making you<br>to get here in New Zealand to accelerate<br>class-leading<br>which once again is you know kind of a<br>technical and scientific challenge<br>they're interested in canned air<br>technology being used to support my<br>development aspirations after were<br>Marley growers that wanted to use it<br>how to build up in<br>so<br>when we spoke to them we said why would<br>we listen to wristed and the opinion of<br>the kabob that Marty community of<br>whether they like that technology or not<br>because it's a little bit like the<br>genetic modification conversation again<br>we see now how might it be applied<br>if people wanted to get involved in this<br>sort of area how that they're planning<br>to what sorts of things and so we want<br>to develop the capacity of Marty<br>entities and Trust to think about how<br>they can make use of a technology and<br>then work with the scientists to apply<br>it to things which dear interesting and<br>and so we'll see you we'll see where<br>that goes up so it's probably more about<br>regardless of what happens on that<br>startup is a kind of a capacity<br>development and component here which<br>will be driven by the interest of Marty<br>groups to advance the economic<br>respirations<br>so i won't i mean i think probably is<br>part of that and whatever we've got for<br>that Q&amp;A session there's opportunities<br>for people to talk about specific<br>examples but we can do that in the<br>so now wide open for questions so<br>anybody's got any Christians there<br>anything that we see it ooh now there's<br>a good time<br>children I mean it to second tie with<br>the third one or more different any<br>before Colin stuccoing one I met tissue<br>education commission i'm on lunch at<br>seven both knew each other in tomorrow<br>chuckles back-trace the transformative<br>opportunity around research and you<br>talked about the impact and outcomes in<br>tucker all of the things i say i've<br>worked in government 21 years is lots<br>and lots of investment gets naked to<br>research though from a family<br>perspective but also from the people<br>that you can involved<br>last year later we were talking about<br>the modern England strategy and sander<br>conversations that we were having 15<br>years ago we're still being spoken about<br>at that same table different people<br>around the table but the same issues so<br>I know lots of monies been put into<br>different areas around language body in<br>hoboken really gets more question is<br>how do you think at the government side<br>we can get better coordinated to make<br>sure that we are either accessing the<br>information it comes out that doing<br>something you with us because it just<br>from my perspective I see it all kind of<br>I hear about reports that come out that<br>very little action happens at the<br>government so I saw your little thing of<br>business science there<br>I'm sitting a little Wellington and you<br>know I see the money go do work and how<br>do we organize ourselves to to really<br>utilize that it was one of the<br>conversations we had around Marley<br>research seems hell in that funding for<br>you know that hang back up again I<br>wasn't me gustaria just saying we will<br>end up so you what's what's your news<br>video<br>so so government by its nature struggles<br>and I Coco kidding i was an attempt to<br>try to do that all that is still a bit<br>clumsy<br>i<br>think i<br>think is there anyone here from Treasury<br>and some work done in treasury around<br>some of this<br>in trying to coordinate some of their<br>investment<br>funny enough it doesn't actually happen<br>the non marti space either times it's<br>not just an issue for the mighty space i<br>think i think<br>it's a good thing about being outside<br>government now am i working with<br>government I<br>don't know what other people's use our<br>in this room but I wouldn't leave it up<br>to the government to coordinate that I<br>think because government's priorities<br>are different there's a political<br>imperative that changes depending who's<br>an office I think the more that Marty<br>can<br>coordinate themselves whether it's under<br>any new adidas arrangement whether it's<br>mighty researchers getting together for<br>example CR I'm IT managers are getting<br>together very shortly for the third<br>fourth conference looking at all the<br>science that they're doing and having a<br>conference two days in ulduar third in<br>the fourth of October and just putting<br>it on the table and I think we're I<br>think we're it works well is where<br>people who have a like copepod because<br>the system so fracture because we they<br>have a light won't get together and<br>share we're all those bits of<br>information when put it on the table I<br>think that's what i would i would<br>recommend the way best way it would work<br>i think from<br>what you are suggesting is you did right<br>now because x same situation you are you<br>know there's so much up there there's a<br>basement all over this place where is it<br>I<br>just I just can't see it coordinating<br>itself through a government and this the<br>likes of Treasury just decided to really<br>put a heavy hand over it which I I don't<br>necessarily see you know there's some<br>stuff done around the muscle Marty<br>well-being stuff that Treasury is doing<br>so it's providing a bit of a coordinated<br>response but it becomes hard but I think<br>it at an institution to institution<br>level I think if people get together on<br>their cope upper and she is probably the<br>best way that has happened and likely to<br>happen going forward I don't know<br>gentlemen as you've gotta love you my<br>Union runs<br>largest I think there's um one is the<br>challenge will still be the same in 15<br>or 20 years as well and will have the<br>same conversation but<br>that's but that's not a problem because<br>it's actually shifted and i think that<br>the parasail shift but when you're in a<br>while you still get the same<br>conversation and sometimes you don't see<br>the changes that have happened so one of<br>the big changes that's happened then<br>probably the last 15 years within 20<br>years is that there's a lot more<br>capacity now so we've had a lot more<br>money go through you know engaging on<br>tertiary education coming through the<br>system ending up in places where they<br>went before so we might only have to<br>tackle him now and maybe operator who<br>else is in there that 20 years ago it<br>wasn't even home and you know in a<br>couple of years they'll probably be two<br>or three more so all of these areas you<br>know you've got people doing<br>getting PhDs and you know<br>neurophysiology and astronomy and all<br>sorts of other things<br>which you don't have before and then<br>they become places of introducing<br>different kinds of concepts and ideas<br>so I think that's positive I think the<br>shift around vision melatonin is going<br>to be the resource part that encourages<br>more activity to happen and I think it's<br>that connectivity between the research<br>that done and in the people are<br>actionable it is often missing and<br>and I guess some of I think the Maori<br>argument is some of the ways that we<br>prefer to work about engaging with<br>stakeholders and collaboration<br>facilitates that exchange so if you do<br>more engagement with us with businesses<br>or other stakeholders of the beginning<br>and they bought into a project then they<br>gotta take out of the things at the back<br>end of it and turn it into something<br>because large you know most researchers</p></main><footer
