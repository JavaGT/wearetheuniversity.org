cyber attack and what can be done to remain secure.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>why cyberwarfare became an attractive<br>option for any government well the<br>answer is simple because it is a<br>effective and efficient way of getting<br>access to somebody's I mean opponents<br>resources by first of all trying to find<br>out what they doing spying then trying<br>to disturb the communication system so<br>in other words the enemy cannot function<br>in the normal way or physically damage<br>their equipment and internet and all the<br>tools which were using on internet are<br>great in accomplish that sort of<br>objectives in a really cheap way<br>well they are evolving in number of<br>directions the first one is of course<br>improvement of tools which are used for<br>penetrating the enemy's systems and<br>those tools are highly sophisticated and<br>they are not popular you can get can't<br>get it on internet but there for free or<br>for up for money nevertheless for<br>instance there is about 6000<br>programmers in employed by the Chinese<br>army and they are trained in attacking<br>the other side so these are<br>definitely way of improving the tools<br>which are used for penetrating the other<br>side and the objective of the tool is to<br>extract information but in the same time<br>being invisible so that as I will not<br>find out what's happening but<br>simultaneously each of those countries<br>are<br>developing something which may be called<br>a software bomb so if something goes<br>wrong we will explode the bombs in the<br>other way we will crush the other<br>system functioning and you could imagine<br>if somebody would be able to crush the<br>communication system of any country's<br>military network the second part is<br>developing a tool which would influence<br>a proper functioning of<br>devices which are connected to internet<br>and perhaps the most famous example of<br>that which happens in 2007 was the<br>development of this virus called Stuxnet<br>this virus was developed<br>by let's say Western countries not know<br>which country to destroy functioning of<br>the Iranian centrifuges Center focus our<br>devices which are used to produce<br>enriched uranium which then is used for<br>atomic bomb and<br>those say this virus Stuxnet virus<br>was planted in on USB stick which was<br>handed to one Iranian scientists who<br>visit one of the western country and why<br>on USB stick because this electronic<br>system which was controlling work of<br>centrifuges was totally isolated from<br>internet but unfortunately the<br>scientists plug in the USB stick to the<br>system and infected those controllers to<br>simply blow up those centrifuges so<br>practically a virus resulted in<br>destroying of a physical devices<br>cyberwarfare<br>generally is associated with military<br>activities also<br>internet may be used as a tool for<br>carrying as a medium of carrying tools<br>for creating a social disturbance and<br>the perhaps the best example of that was<br>happening in<br>Estonian government decided to move a<br>monument which was erected in their<br>capital to commemorate<br>saw Russian soldiers which were killed<br>during the Second World War they wanted<br>to move this monument from the central<br>place of the city to the not so exposed<br>place and<br>well the point is that about 1/4 of the<br>population of Estonia are Russians and<br>for obvious reason they were unhappy<br>about that sort of plans and<br>the a massive distributed<br>denial-of-service attack was launched<br>against the government and industrial<br>organization in Estonia practically for<br>a number of days number of Ministers<br>were unable to work the website of the<br>Parliament was blocked the number of the<br>bank site were also suspended<br>probability of<br>new zealand being a target of a cyber<br>attack on a mass scale is rather remote<br>what is probable is the attack from some<br>individuals which for some reasons has<br>something against particular person<br>organization or a group of people but<br>there is other chance that there's a<br>other problem which is quite which<br>exists even right now and that is a<br>problem of a collateral damage damage<br>the point is that<br>when there is a<br>distributed denial of attack planned it<br>requires participation of thousands of<br>different parties and<br>those parties may come from different<br>parts of the world and it may come that<br>for some reasons<br>somebody pick up some installation in<br>new zealand as a launching pad for<br>attack against the other targets and<br>this is something which is real which<br>could happen we are trusted and we are<br>trusting in the other words the security<br>measures which we introduce into our<br>systems are not very very<br>tight and we may involuntary participate<br>in somebody's else attacks against the<br>other targets and this is something<br>which required us as a society as<br>organization as a government to pay<br>attention how we secure in a traditional<br>information system way our installation<br>the best way to protect organization is<br>first of all to motivate people because<br>many specialist security says that<br>people are the weakest link in security<br>chain this means that we need to teach<br>people what are the requirements to keep<br>our system secure still for instance the<br>question of brink of your own devices<br>how to protect them how to protect<br>installation if you plug your laptop and<br>these are those issue which are nothing<br>unknown that simply has to be introduced<br>to keep our system secure and not<br>necessary against the cyber warriors in<br>the terms that some foreign country will<br>try to invite our system but simply<br>against hackers and this is what we need</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
