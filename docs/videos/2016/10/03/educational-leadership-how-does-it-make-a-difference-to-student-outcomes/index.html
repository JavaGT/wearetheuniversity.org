passion for educational<br>leadership came from a family of<br>principles but also surprise surprise<br>from my stunt as head of<br>school where I<br>realized not that it was not only<br>important and extreme<br>difficult to do in an academic<br>environment but I became aware of the<br>attributions that others make about the<br>importance of<br>leadership and I wasn't um so aware of<br>it until that time so good research<br>things come out of being a head of<br>sculpt for those of you that are<br>contemplating<br>it policy makers<br>politicians and the general public have<br>absolutely no doubt about the<br>importance of school leadership to<br>student outcomes indeed parents use it<br>the quality of leadership or what they<br>think the quality of leadership is as a<br>way of choosing a school for their<br>children absolutely no doubt of its<br>importance and yet<br>paradoxically researchers have had huge<br>trouble both testing and demonstrating<br>the link<br>between the quality of school leadership<br>and student outcomes whether those<br>outcomes are well-being social<br>outcomes or academic outcomes in the<br>sense of achievement measured over<br>time IE learning<br>and perhaps one of the reasons for the<br>difficulty that researchers have had in<br>making this<br>link is the long causal chain between<br>school<br>leadership and outcomes because school<br>leaders exercise their influence<br>indirectly by creating the conditions<br>that make it possible for teachers to<br>make a bigger difference with the<br>students that they're working<br>with so that's one reason why perhaps<br>it's been so difficult<br>to demonstrate or test the strength of<br>this<br>link and the other<br>reason is perhaps that educational<br>leadership<br>research has been theorized or at least<br>the<br>measures that have been used to assess<br>the quality of school leadership have<br>been based on business and management<br>theories of<br>leadership notably a theory called<br>transformational leadership which<br>assesses the extent to which leaders uh<br>have such qualities as<br>Charisma uh able to motivate the<br>followers<br>um are able to provide intellectual<br>stimulation and individual consideration<br>so another words the qualities that were<br>assessed were the qualities that are<br>generic to leadership of any<br>organization missing from those measures<br>and from those theories uh<br>engagement with the work of<br>Education engagement for example<br>items such as um our school leadership<br>or the principle of the school as<br>reported by teachers because it's<br>teachers that complete these surveys<br>about the quality of school leadership<br>that um my school principal gives useful<br>feedback to teachers my school principal<br>works with teachers to learn from<br>students work about how to improve<br>teaching etc those were missing<br>so that led to a question um that I had<br>and the Ministry of Education had who<br>funded this work that led to a question<br>about what happens if we can sort the<br>research into measures which have<br>actually tried to access the education<br>the specifically<br>educational features of leadership<br>versus the more generic<br>and so that's uh the result that we got<br>from the first meta analysis is that the<br>transformational leadership Studies have<br>shown an average effect of leadership on<br>student outcomes of slightly less than<br>02 and in what's called instructional<br>leadership in the United States measures<br>of leadership that the that are<br>theorized and more educational tombs are<br>showing a considerably uh greater impact<br>on student outcomes still not um not<br>large but at Le but there the relative<br>difference is quite<br>important uh these studies were<br>theorized as a miscellany of a whole lot<br>of other different<br>theories but in terms of so that's<br>that's interesting that's showing that<br>maybe we need to attend to the way we<br>theorize and measure educational<br>leadership if we're going to look for<br>these effects and maybe educational<br>leadership needs to be um thought about<br>at least in terms of uh inclusive of the<br>educational practices involved and the<br>educational<br>knowledge but these are still very<br>abstract conceptions of leadership and<br>if we're thinking about how do we take<br>the this knowledge into the possibility<br>for intervention and for leadership<br>development on which millions of dollars<br>is being spent in oecd countries and<br>indeed wider than that um just talking<br>about instructional leadership is far<br>too abstract conception so the next<br>question we asked is well what are<br>actually the practices involved can we<br>see these practices in more detail can<br>we learn about the relative impacts of<br>different sorts of leadership<br>practice and that was our second<br>metaanalysis which a team of us did uh<br>and it shows some of the average<br>relative um effects of Dimensions or<br>sets of practices so we can create<br>something of a story about how<br>leadership makes its effect through<br>setting go goals and<br>expectations resourcing those goals<br>getting involved in the work of<br>monitoring overseeing being close to the<br>work of teaching and learning and this<br>one is a biggie which is learning with<br>your<br>teachers and supporting that learning<br>both formally and informally and all on<br>the foundation of an environment a<br>context which is culturally physically<br>and socially safe and inclusive for both<br>uh staff and<br>students so those are some of the thing<br>some some of the uh relative effects<br>that we have based on the research<br>evidence that we had at the<br>time and since doing that work um our<br>research team involving clear Cinema dri<br>laf U myself Fraya and some of our<br>students have been looking at this<br>second question if we think about these<br>as sets of practices that we know<br>something about the relative effects of<br>those practices on uh student outcomes<br>and the quality of teaching next<br>question is what are the capabilities<br>that leaders need in order to be able to<br>engage in those practices so our current<br>research program is looking very much at<br>how do leaders build the trust that they<br>need in order to do the work of<br>improvement which involves solving<br>complex teaching and learning problems<br>and bringing your educational knowledge<br>to Bear thanks very much</p></main><footer
