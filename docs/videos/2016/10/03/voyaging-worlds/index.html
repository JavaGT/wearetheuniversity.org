Solander favorite student of<br>Linnaeus the botanist arrived on board<br>the endeavor in October 1769 and this<br>was a scientific expedition sailing on<br>the crest of the enlightenment they were<br>trying to measure the size of the solar<br>system and to discover as I said Terra<br>Australis incognita and to study as<br>plants animals and people on both sides<br>of early settlement then in this country<br>there's been a history of high ambition<br>exploration rapid adaptation and<br>innovation out of Asia and the Pacific<br>on the one hand and our<br>Europe on the other and as an<br>anthropologist now there's my hometown<br>1769 some of the plants they collected<br>when they ran ashore as an<br>anthropologist I had been really<br>fortunate to study these voyage in<br>worlds I was trained originally in for<br>field anthropology in the States<br>biological anthropology archaeology<br>linguistics and social anthropology and<br>I'm very fortunate I think that my<br>discipline had has avoided that<br>Cartesian abyss between the natural and<br>the social sciences and between the idea<br>of people and so-called environment and<br>so on mind and matter subject and object<br>those kind of Cartesian divides don't<br>really belong in the discipline that I<br>belong to when I was originally they<br>used to call it the study it's got this<br>great global scope they used to call it<br>the study of man and then sometime in<br>the early 60s they realized that was a<br>bit sexist and so my professor when I<br>first came here to the University of<br>Auckland Ralph Pennington used to start<br>off the stage while Nick just by saying<br>anthropology is a science of man<br>embracing women but he was trying not to<br>be sexist<br>didn't quite work but anyway good good<br>effort Ralph and perhaps because of that<br>I've been a bit of a disciplinary nomad<br>you might say moving from chomskyan<br>linguistics which is quasi mathematical<br>my master's thesis was a Chomsky in<br>grammar to socio linguistics to social<br>and cultural anthropology to historical<br>anthropology and sort of mixing them all<br>up all the time to environmental<br>anthropology and now I guess<br>philosophical anthropology you might say<br>and from New Zealand across the Pacific<br>and to Europe I guess that's what<br>happens when you spend your academic<br>career studying people who've spent a<br>lot of time trying to discover what's<br>across the horizon<br>and in addition I've been really<br>fortunate to have a deep exposure to<br>Marty knowledge and ways of<br>understanding the world with elders like<br>ed Oh ed of Sterling mitimiti Penfold<br>and many others over the years and my<br>colleagues and Marty studies so now I'm<br>engaged at what I would call experiments<br>across worlds what happens and what has<br>happened in New Zealand and elsewhere in<br>the Pacific as people with very<br>different ideas about how reality works<br>have come together and try to negotiate<br>shared ways of living so that's kind of<br>where I locate myself and have done for<br>I guess for a long time and I think I'm<br>really fortunate to work as an<br>anthropologist in my own country and in<br>the Pacific region there's never<br>never a dull moment I'm often working on<br>questions of intense public interest so<br>recently I wrote something in response<br>to Alan Duff about the mess damas the<br>city and fatherhood in Marty families at<br>the time of early contact which showed<br>that Marty men at that period according<br>to all the European male observers were<br>very tender fathers and violence towards<br>women and children was almost unknown<br>which seemed to arouse an extraordinary<br>public interest with about 17,000<br>Facebook hits so very interesting so you<br>have to think all the time and very hard<br>about how you're communicating into whom<br>trying to strike a balance between all<br>sorts of different audiences as an<br>anthropologist in my own country<br>Maori are always a major part of my<br>audience and Pacific people and like<br>anthropologists and many other parts of<br>the world but equally people just out<br>there are fascinated very often by the<br>sorts of things that we are enquiring<br>into and so you have to balance between<br>observing the rigors of scientific and<br>scholarly disciplines and being able to<br>talk and in ways where more or less<br>everybody can understand what you're<br>saying and sometimes I think our arcane<br>languages might be a bit of a reflex of<br>the monastic history of scholarly and<br>different I used to think about that a<br>lot when I was in Cambridge<br>sort of the way that the modern<br>university arose in Oxford and Cambridge<br>originally out of monastic communities<br>so the retreat from the world type of<br>thing but as a scholar and Marty studies<br>like all of my colleagues there's just<br>no chance to do that really<br>you're always negotiating radical<br>challenges to scholarly or thought<br>authority from all sides whether from<br>students from people you meet in the<br>streets at parties you know you're<br>liable to be sort of shoulder tapped<br>when you just relaxing on the beach and<br>so I wants to talk to you about some<br>very intense matter to do with the<br>treaty you know it's so it's interesting<br>and a parliament from time to time<br>because it's also the case that many of<br>these issues have sort of you know<br>public importance in anthropology I<br>guess we take it for granted then as<br>people ourselves there's no external<br>position no pure position from which we<br>can observe the lives of others or<br>indeed life in general or indeed the<br>world in general you know we're located<br>by our who we are as people and our<br>historical and cultural contexts there's<br>no getting out of it despite our<br>pretensions to the contrary at times so<br>we often study our own societies to try<br>and grasp the presuppositions the forms<br>of order that we are taking for granted<br>ourselves as scholars because these can<br>be an impediment and understanding the<br>lives of people who think differently<br>and understand the world in other ways<br>so a participant observation is the<br>signature method or technique in our<br>discipline it's it works across that<br>cartesian divide of subject and object<br>it's about getting involved but at the<br>same time in order to learn building up<br>very close relationships but at the same<br>time there's the need to preserve a<br>degree of critical distance and this is<br>so in my work I've been located on the<br>cutting edge of encounters between<br>worlds the worlds of Europe as they've<br>arrived here in New Zealand in<br>particular in the in the Pacific<br>and the worlds of Asian and Polynesia<br>and assumptions about what is real and<br>how the world works I'm very different<br>than these cultural locations and<br>historical times and this provokes a<br>sort of questioning skeptical attitude<br>to assertions of authority and science<br>and politics or even elsewhere even<br>sometimes in the university acting I say<br>it and it fosters a very long view of<br>human history in which scholarship<br>itself is included as one of human<br>endeavors we tend to see as<br>anthropologists human history as one<br>rather short spanned in a very long<br>planetary and cosmological history and<br>all of those other strands as being<br>intimate intimately entangled with ours<br>so if you think about the life of people<br>then law medicine engineering technology<br>the sciences politics economics and so<br>on are all topics of anthropological<br>interest and indeed anthropologists<br>study them and we have sub disciplines<br>in these areas that makes you acutely<br>interested in what everybody else in the<br>university is doing and trying to sort<br>of do your best to follow some at least<br>of the great findings that our<br>colleagues are making and that's why the<br>university as a community is such a<br>fantastic place to be so I get very<br>excited by what's going on with complex<br>systems Theory planetary transformations<br>and loving systems that surround us and<br>impacting on lives everywhere but in the<br>Pacific Canada New Zealand the present<br>the ocean waterways landscapes the<br>atmosphere are the life forms as they<br>entangle with ours and from that I guess<br>I'm drawing on marty philosophy as well<br>and some of you will know that recently<br>very recently in parliament the<br>Whanganui treaty settlement was passed<br>into law which recognizes the one in our<br>River as a as a legal person<br>with its own rights it's the first time<br>in the world that a river has achieved<br>that recognition interacting with people<br>and I think on a scientific basis this<br>is accurate they've been there the<br>rivers been there for a lot longer than<br>we have and it has its own requirements<br>to be healthy on which we all depend and<br>turn so it's impossible to understand I<br>think human experience in different<br>times and places without trying to<br>understand at least something of the<br>exchanges between people in these wider<br>systems at different scales right down<br>to the molecular level and I've got<br>colleagues who call themselves like Lisa<br>mitosis myth and molecular<br>anthropologist and that in turn is<br>pretty much impossible as I'm sure you<br>will all understand but very exciting I<br>love being an anthropologist in my own<br>country and the extraordinary challenges<br>that poses it you just can never rest on<br>your laurels for one second always<br>supposing you have son and the<br>University of Auckland I have to say has<br>been a fantastic place from which to do<br>it<br>Narita Airport on ateva tena koutou tena</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
