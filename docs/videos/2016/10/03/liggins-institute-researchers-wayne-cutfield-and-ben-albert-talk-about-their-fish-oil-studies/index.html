Researchers Dr Ben Albert and Professor Wayne Cutfield of the Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, discuss the findings, and their earlier study, which found most fish oil supplements sold in New Zealand are oxidised ("off", or rancid) to varying degrees (four other independent studies in North America, Europe and Africa have also found oxidation of supplements).</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>omega-3 fish oil supplements are one of<br>the most popular or commonly taken<br>supplements in the world fish oil<br>capsules are very fragile exposure to<br>light ear into being warmed leads to<br>them becoming oxidized or off because we<br>realized that they might go off we<br>tested products on the New Zealand<br>market and what we found was that almost<br>all of those products were oxidized<br>above recommended levels there are in<br>studies from around the world that have<br>shown the same thing from Norway from<br>South Africa and North America we also<br>realized that oils that have become<br>oxidized might have different effects on<br>the body and those effects could be<br>harmful pregnancy is a really special<br>time because the fetus is more sensitive<br>to chemicals and other things that might<br>affect and health of mammal baby and we<br>also know that around one and teen<br>pregnant woman take fish oil so it's<br>really important for us to know if it<br>might have harmful effects so in our<br>later study we looked at rats that were<br>pregnant and we gave them fish oil<br>during pregnancy or an oxidized fish oil<br>for sure that had gone off what we found<br>was that at the end of pregnancy when<br>the rats were born in the group where<br>mum had an oxidized for oil nearly a<br>third of the babies died we were<br>surprised to see such a strong effect of<br>the oxidized oil<br>almost a third of newborn rats died<br>after their mothers were feared oxidized<br>or off for sure during pregnancy however<br>unoxidized fish oil did not have this<br>effect studies from New Zealand and<br>overseas have shown that fish oil<br>supplements are frequently oxidized when<br>sold we can't apply the findings from<br>our study directly to humans but there<br>is some cause for caution it's not<br>possible to simply translate the<br>findings from our study directly into<br>human pregnancy we gave a higher dose of<br>fish oil than we would usually take in<br>pregnancy and the oil was also more<br>oxidized<br>the health risks of oxidized fish oil to<br>the unborn baby at present are unknown<br>it is not possible to know whether fish<br>oil supplements that are purchased are<br>oxidized at the point of sale thus we<br>believe it is wise that pregnant women<br>do not take fish oil supplements until<br>the risks are better understood at<br>present we would recommend eating fresh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
