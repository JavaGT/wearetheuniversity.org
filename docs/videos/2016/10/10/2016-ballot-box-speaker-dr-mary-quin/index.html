that introduction<br>tena koutou katoa good evening everybody<br>and great to be here in Auckland and on<br>the campus of the University of Auckland<br>for talking about topic near and dear to<br>my heart which is of course innovation<br>but<br>look in 12 minutes that I have I'd like<br>to and I've got a little road map here<br>of what I want to cover so that I<br>hopefully don't waffle too much but i<br>wanted to talk a bit about why rd is<br>important as part of innovation what are<br>the characteristics are building on some<br>of<br>sean's points or characteristics of<br>innovative cities how well auckland ways<br>in which Aucklanders demonstrating that<br>kind of innovative behavior and<br>resources and then some thoughts about<br>what auckland could or should be doing<br>to go to the next level of being an<br>innovation hub so why is ardee a<br>critical part of innovation it's it's<br>really the fundamental it's what<br>everything else comes from and its<br>scientific breakthroughs and the applied<br>research that figures out where that<br>science could be useful and then the<br>product development that turns it into<br>something useful that really is at the<br>heart of all prosperity all productivity<br>improvement I'm not an economist but<br>that's may may definition of how the<br>world works so that R&amp;D is really<br>fundamental to innovation sometimes it<br>can be quite informal R&amp;D and sometimes<br>very long term very expensive equipment<br>big labs and so forth but absolutely<br>critical and it's not just where the<br>yardi ism even the corporation's doing<br>the Rd and the products they're<br>developing that's so beneficial it's the<br>spillover effects to other businesses<br>that build products based on one<br>company's new idea and it's also the<br>spillover effects for society as a whole<br>there's a fantastic book the new<br>geography of jobs by on Rico Minetti<br>that I'd recommend<br>anyone's interested in this but he<br>points out that<br>for every rd or high tech job that is<br>created five other service jobs are<br>created in that community of society two<br>of them highly skilled service jobs on<br>average doctors lawyers accountants<br>three of them less highly-skilled<br>weather taxi drivers<br>restaurant hotel employees and so forth<br>so huge economic benefit and the other<br>really interesting data and as a<br>comparison across American cities is<br>showing that in cities where there's a<br>high incidence of Rd<br>technical jobs the wages for unskilled<br>jobs are also much higher in fact he<br>compares say San Jose California part of<br>Silicon Valley with Merced California<br>that's only less than 200 miles away and<br>the number of the percentage of the<br>workforce with university degrees in San<br>Jose is forty-seven percent in merced<br>it's eleven percent but in San Jose<br>people worth a high school education<br>earn as much as people with a university<br>education doing Merced California so<br>amazing data on the spillover effects<br>and the economic and social benefits of<br>having a community that's got lots of<br>businesses lots of industries that are<br>already intensive and our innovative so<br>what are some of these characterize the<br>characteristics of cities that become<br>successful innovation hubs<br>in general they have one or more really<br>significant research universities and<br>when they've commented on how Auckland<br>has the benefits of the huge success of<br>University of Auckland also aut also<br>Massey University with campuses here in<br>the Auckland area plus i think five<br>significant polytechnics that do some rd<br>as well and particularly in applied<br>research so auckland is well<br>resourced and term of having academic<br>University tertiary education level<br>research the really interesting thing is<br>that the existence of universities<br>however good is a necessary but not<br>sufficient condition and<br>the data shows that it's not that the<br>university exists as many university<br>many cities in the united states where<br>the university is very good but never<br>become an innovation hub what makes the<br>difference is<br>one or a handful of superstars at that<br>university or a superstar entrepreneur<br>so<br>the whole development of Silicon Valley<br>you know the invention of the<br>semiconductor Fairchild Semiconductor<br>sort of the ground zero of Silicon<br>Valley if you go back far enough Eastman<br>Kodak Company George Eastman Rochester<br>New York was the center of the whole<br>optics technologies that survive for<br>close to a hundred years in that city so<br>it's quite serendipitous a really good<br>example Bill Gates started Microsoft in<br>Albuquerque New Mexico<br>move the company in its very early<br>stages to Seattle huge difference today<br>between the economies of Albuquerque and<br>Seattle completely serendipitous because<br>that was his hometown and he thought<br>Boeing was there there'd be lots of<br>engineers that he could tap into so<br>really interesting now it seems like<br>that something government couldn't<br>really influence local or central so<br>quite interesting university of auckland<br>had proposed a sort of entrepreneurial<br>program to attract you know superstars<br>if you like really highly skilled<br>research teams from around the world and<br>there's funding available not just the<br>university of auckland to do that but<br>across new zealand university so there's<br>gonna be a really really interesting<br>experiments quite difficult to pull off<br>but good on the universities for giving<br>it a go we'll see if it works can you<br>actually pick the right superstar and<br>embed them in a different country now<br>Ireland did it quite successfully so<br>there's reasons to believe it'll work so<br>fantastic<br>auckland led the charge to do that<br>another thing that's really critical is<br>a technology transfer so great to see md<br>sheng care community services<br>getting that science out of the<br>university and research institute labs<br>and into business who's who can actually<br>commercialize it and Auckland's got so<br>much going for it in that space so what<br>next talk about with boz dojo the grid<br>precinct and the wounded quarter the<br>university's engineering school and<br>investment and new market<br>the Icehouse incubator a lot of<br>capability in the auckland area to help<br>encourage pulling science out of the<br>academic environment and getting it into<br>the hands of businesses that can build<br>on it the third thing that's really<br>crucial is a skilled workforce and<br>probably every innovation hub struggles<br>with this because there is a sort of a<br>global competition for four rd talent<br>technical talent we can either grow our<br>own or we can import it through<br>immigration probably need to do both<br>here I think Auckland's international<br>sort of education export strengths a<br>different industry but again brings a<br>lot of students from around the world<br>into the Auckland area and many of them<br>with the right immigration policies are<br>able to stay and contribute their<br>education to you Zealand businesses so<br>again a real strength that Auckland has<br>in that space<br>the fourth one is capital and this is<br>probably the biggest struggle all of the<br>businesses that I've talked to over the<br>last three years about what's holding<br>you back from growing bigger faster<br>can't find their skilled workforce can't<br>find venture capital got always had more<br>sympathy for the former than the latter<br>because the world is awash and capital<br>looking for great investments so one of<br>the things you can count on one hand the<br>number of intricate capital firms in<br>Auckland a lot better than Anchorage<br>where I live for 14 years where there<br>were zero venture capital firms but<br>still for the size of the population<br>it would be really great if there were<br>ways to get more of that venture cap<br>that's so crucial for startup companies<br>and growing companies to be able to<br>afford to hire the people and invest in<br>the rd that generates new products<br>so those are the four things so<br>Auckland's got a lot going for it got<br>some areas that need needs them some<br>work but certainly the building blocks<br>are in place to truly be a world player<br>in terms of an innovation hub<br>what are some of the things that<br>Auckland might think about doing more of<br>or doing in the future and they come<br>down to three things for me<br>global virtual and visible so global is<br>about and I think both Nick and Shawn<br>have have touched on this<br>not thinking about Auckland is the<br>biggest fish in the New Zealand pond but<br>what does it take to really be an<br>innovation hub on the world stage and<br>Auckland can be that and that's good for<br>all of New Zealand the opinions of the<br>dairy farmers notwithstanding<br>because it really adds you know they all<br>tell you about what's good for General<br>Motors is good for the US but I think<br>what is good for Auckland is an engine<br>that pulls the entire New Zealand<br>economy and what's also important is<br>this is not a zero-sum game New Zealand<br>probably could easily develop five or<br>six major innovation hubs so Wellington<br>Christchurch Tirana Hamilton Dunedin go<br>for it guys the fact that our auction<br>disturbing world doesn't mean others<br>have less opportunity to do well so what<br>does it mean to be really focused on<br>global it's building relationships with<br>other hubs going from Sister Cities to<br>brother hubs picking relationships with<br>cities that are really at really doing<br>this well that can be silicon valley tel<br>aviv london<br>thinking really broadly about how to<br>build those relationships how to<br>co-sponsor events in those other cities<br>building on the visibility but learning<br>from moving people back and forth<br>students<br>and scientists and entrepreneurs<br>between Auckland and other major<br>innovation hubs around the world there's<br>an element of virtual not thinking about<br>Auckland just as a physical place but<br>it's virtual connections and<br>capabilities again as a major center of<br>Education there's a lot of potential<br>here I think to accelerate for the<br>tertiary education system in general to<br>really grab hold of remote learning and<br>think about building those rd skills by<br>tapping expertise teachers of<br>science engineering technology from<br>anywhere in the world it doesn't any<br>longer have to be the instructor of the<br>professor standing in the classroom it<br>could be the best person the best<br>teacher of that knowledge is not always<br>the best scientist<br>sharing that knowledge from anywhere in<br>the world with technology available to<br>do that how do we create portals in our<br>labs to labs in institutes and even in<br>universities evil corporations<br>anywhere else in the world using<br>technology to do that how do we<br>recognize job training more effectively<br>and the training that people learn<br>working for corporations because that's<br>really not formalized as part of<br>someone's life long learning and yet I<br>would say probably in my career what I<br>learned at Kodak at Xerox at avid is<br>probably many times more than that<br>formal training in science as a student<br>so in closing I think making or<br>promoting Auckland internationally<br>making it visible run with the big dogs<br>until you get to be a big dog is really<br>important and then the last thing I'd<br>suggest I was really intrigued coming<br>back to them to hear about this Dunedin<br>study where they took this cohort of<br>about a thousand kids born in 1972-73<br>why doesn't Oakland do that with<br>thousand however many we've got<br>high tech startups that launched in 2017<br>and follow them for dec aids what do<br>they do do they hire what businesses do<br>they decide to go into how do they raise<br>capital what are their failures how do<br>they deal with those failures what<br>causes them to start exporting would<br>that be awesome 20 years from now what<br>we would know that we don't know today<br>and the rest of the world would pay<br>attention to that and put or condone the<br>map and make us more visible thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
