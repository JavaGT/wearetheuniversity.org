introduction<br>but I'm actually a relatively new<br>aucklander in fact I used to work from<br>famiry Quinn and in Wellington once upon<br>a time and and so I had an interesting<br>experience a couple of years ago so I<br>just moved to all kind of been been<br>working at university of auckland for<br>about a month and i was presenting<br>talking about similar topic about<br>innovation to the red meat association<br>of new zealand and i gave my talk and<br>you know you was a different audience<br>tonight there are a lot of<br>farmers out there you know you picture a<br>stereotype of a of a farmer they weren't<br>all they didn't quite all fit that<br>stereotype but sure enough at the end of<br>my talk a sort of at all weather-beaten<br>man got up and said you know what's the<br>problem with a New Zealand economy<br>Auckland right he you know he told me<br>that that you know auckland was the<br>break it was the bottleneck right we<br>couldn't get our roads right you know<br>we've got housing price problems and and<br>so actually if we could just get rid of<br>Auckland<br>actually userland economy will do an<br>awful lot better so let's talk tonight<br>is kind of a little bit of my response<br>to that and so I want to set the scene<br>for the for the next two speakers in for<br>our discussion afterwards and and think<br>about well you know is it true if we got<br>rid of Auckland would New Zealand runner<br>a whole lot better or are there things<br>that that Auckland does that are unique<br>and important to the economy so that<br>tonight's really my response to that<br>question and and so I'm going to start<br>you know why are some places more<br>innovative than others right we all have<br>a sense that there are parts of the<br>world that do innovation really well and<br>patch the world that perhaps don't do<br>innovation so well I'm and so you know<br>Auckland and one way of measuring<br>innovation is to look at how many<br>patents we put out per person right how<br>many how many patents will be filing now<br>patents don't tell us everything about<br>innovation right and some sectors we<br>won't you we wouldn't use patents but<br>another sectors they're really important<br>and that's the same more or less the<br>will ground so patents are a measure<br>that we can use to get a little bit of a<br>handle on on on innovation and so<br>between 1978 and 2008 or can produce one<br>patent for every 750 people okay so<br>that's that's not too bad right it seems<br>like there's a few of us running around<br>coming up with new ideas um you know how<br>about Christchurch well Christchurch's<br>produce one per thousand and actually<br>that turns out to be the new zealand<br>average right if you average right<br>across the country and you look at how<br>innovative new zealanders in fact you<br>know christchurch's the average New<br>Zealanders are produce one patent for<br>every thousand so in fact when we look<br>at Auckland and on this measure all<br>kinds seems to be more innovative than<br>the rest of the country and in fact this<br>is a general trend right if you look at<br>studies overseas the larger the city the<br>more patents per person the city<br>generate and so if we go to Australia<br>and I studied roughly about it's a<br>little bit bigger than all fun but about<br>the same size if we looked at Perth then<br>it actually it turns out that purse<br>produced one patent for every 750 people<br>and sure enough if we look at Sydney and<br>Melbourne which studies of about four<br>million people then we're producing<br>there's one Peyton per every 500 people<br>this actually turns out to be very very<br>general right if we look at lots of<br>different parts of the world the more<br>people there are the more patents per<br>person right that's not just more<br>patents because there are more people<br>those people are producing more patents<br>and originally because they're in big as<br>a thief and so this not only carries<br>across from patents we can look at other<br>measures of innovation and find that on<br>other measures of innovation bigger<br>cities do better and even productivity<br>and ultimately<br>productivity is one of the most<br>important you know it's one of the<br>things we want out of innovation we want<br>to generate higher productivity we want<br>higher wages we want more value add from<br>workers burger studies indeed produce<br>more productivity and add more value per<br>employee right and so you know New<br>Zealand fits that sorry all conf it's<br>this trend within New Zealand perfectly<br>right as I've said orkin produces more<br>patents per person than any other region<br>of New Zealand and in fact it's more<br>productive right so firms in Auckland<br>enjoy a 25-percent productivity premium<br>/ firms and other parts of the country<br>right okay this doesn't quite apply to<br>all firms right if you're a dairy<br>company right setting up a dairy farm in<br>the middle of Auckland won't be a<br>particularly productive move but almost<br>all industries that aren't<br>resource-based actually if you move them<br>to Auckland they'll be more productive<br>so size matters right size matters when<br>it comes to innovation but it's not<br>everything and the example I like to use<br>is comparing detroit vs san francisco so<br>you think of detroit right we think of<br>car manufacturing and in fact Detroit<br>for a long long period of time had the<br>three largest car manufacturers in the<br>world and had all the size and scale you<br>could want right yet today right we know<br>that it's a city that's bankrupts the<br>car manufacturers are struggling and its<br>really finding it hard to reinvent<br>itself whereas San Francisco a city<br>that's much more diverse right it's got<br>the semiconductor industry it's the the<br>hub of the biotech industry and the US<br>and it's also where software has taken<br>off so San Francisco innocence is much<br>more diverse so it's not just about<br>being the largest right if it was about<br>being the largest Detroit would be very<br>successful today it's also about what<br>you do and the diversity of things that<br>you do all right so and it turns out<br>that cities that are more diverse in<br>terms of their technological or<br>industrial specializations actually turn<br>out to be doing things that all this<br>common or more novel right and so<br>they're doing things that perhaps they<br>have less competition in so why might<br>that be right well this is partly<br>because studies particularly diverse<br>cities are a dating service for ideas<br>right it's where ideas come into contact<br>and I like to use this example this is<br>that this is actually a shameless plug<br>for my book but there is a lesson on<br>this so there's a great innovation on<br>the cover of my book it's the barcode i<br>can it's really interesting to think<br>about whether why did where do we end up<br>with bar codes or non web products well<br>it required the meeting of two quite<br>different ideas the original bar code<br>was actually come up came up with what<br>by the US national railways corporation<br>and they were looking at ways to load to<br>keep a keep track of their railway<br>wagons right they had this idea will<br>paint these colored stripes on the side<br>of these railway wagons and each strip<br>will be unique and that'll that'll be a<br>unique identifier for our wagons and we<br>can will stop losing them in different<br>parts of the country the problem was and<br>this was in that this was in the early<br>1960s when they did this they didn't<br>have an efficient way of reading them<br>right and in fact they had to wait<br>another 20 years before before the<br>technology that they needed to read<br>these barcodes actually became available<br>and that was the laser ok now the laser<br>actually was invented around the same<br>time as the barcode right but it took 20<br>years for these technologies to meet and<br>produce something that was usable so<br>what's going on in cities and big<br>diverse cities is that ideas are meeting<br>and going on to create useful<br>innovations and so in fact this is<br>this is New Zealand regions right and so<br>here's that diversity of industries with<br>their new zealand regions so the further<br>out you are out here the more and the<br>more industries that you support in your<br>region and so sure enough opens out here<br>the if you're down this side then you're<br>much more specialized right you have a<br>fewer industries and here's the<br>uniqueness of<br>those industries so here industries up<br>here are not very unique so everybody<br>has those industries right and so<br>gisburn and the Hawke's Bay are up here<br>whereas opens down here so Auckland's<br>not only the most diverse economy in New<br>Zealand it's also doing things that no<br>one else is right and this again this<br>turns out to be a general trend the more<br>diversity the more unique that things<br>are that you're the things that are that<br>you're doing and part of that as<br>explained by the fact that you're<br>allowing new ideas to come into contact<br>and generate new industries right so<br>often has a greater diversity of<br>industries than any other region in New<br>Zealand and many of these industries are<br>unique to Auckland right Auckland's the<br>only part of New Zealand participating<br>in them right so actually you know<br>Auckland's not a break on the New<br>Zealand economy it's not the bottleneck<br>Auckland's our innovation engine right<br>Auckland is our most productive and<br>innovative study by almost any measure<br>you can come up with and it's got a<br>greater diversity of industries than any<br>other new zealand city and many of these<br>industries only exist here in Auckland<br>and I think the conclusion is that New<br>Zealand will not succeed if Auckland<br>doesn't succeed so I did manage to get a<br>response a little bit like that back to<br>my dairy farmer who I was talking to but<br>without all the charts<br>however right of course we know that<br>that's not all the story right we know<br>actually there's a big wide world out<br>there so it's great that Auckland's the<br>most innovative city in New Zealand but<br>actually there's a there's a there's a<br>whole world out there and we know there<br>are much more there are much bigger<br>cities and there are much more diverse<br>cities out there so what are we going to<br>do about that how does Auckland<br>instead of competing and thinking about<br>what's going on the rest of you on how<br>does auckland start thinking as if it<br>was a study a much larger to take on<br>these bigger parts of and more<br>innovative parts of the world well part<br>of the clue lies in if we zoom in right<br>so this is some work we did and actually<br>this is this is what i was doing that<br>saturday night on my laptop at home i<br>decided to construct the social network<br>of inventors and new zealand so we like<br>i downloaded a big patent database<br>looked at and you can pull out because<br>inventors write down their home address<br>on the peyton data database you can<br>geolocate them and then you can build<br>their social network based on based on<br>who they've worked with right so if you<br>have filed a patent with someone else<br>then I put I take a guess that you know<br>them and I can then reconstruct the<br>network of people as they've interacted<br>as they've innovated right and so this<br>is the map of awk one what we learn is<br>that again the bigger the city the more<br>networked the people are in that city so<br>Auckland has the most has the densest<br>network of innovators in New Zealand but<br>actually if we read to Sydney Sydney has<br>a denser network of innovators in<br>Auckland and if I go to Tokyo Tokyo has<br>a denser network of innovators than<br>suddenly so my first<br>conclusion is where Auckland needs to go<br>is we need to get much better at<br>connecting right we need to build<br>connections we need to make sure that<br>our city is as well connected and that<br>we are that we're actually innovating<br>with others it's<br>used to have this great social network<br>for not sharing ideas right it's all<br>very well going for a beer with<br>everybody in Auckland but if you tight<br>lipped about what you're doing and<br>you're not prepared to share your ideas<br>and exchange them and allow them to<br>collide the national debt social network<br>is useless and then my last point is<br>really we need to diversify right i mean<br>so many times I hear that a new zealand<br>well you can't do that right you know<br>New Zealand wheat where we got up<br>farming right and so somehow what we do<br>has to be connected to the land actually<br>you know we can compete globally on<br>anything and so we've got to stop<br>telling ourselves got to stop<br>controlling ourselves about the types of<br>things we can do and and you know and<br>the data shows that as we become more<br>innovative we will indeed diversify and<br>become a more diverse economy so I'm<br>going to leave it at that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
