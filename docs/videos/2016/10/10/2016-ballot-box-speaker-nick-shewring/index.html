notice no slides<br>so I do have a tendency to waffle so if<br>I seem like I'm getting totally off<br>topic just kind of try and redirect<br>coming back onto something yeah thank<br>you thank you I've actually brought<br>helpers just to kind of steer me on a<br>path which is good it's been a heck of a<br>journey with biz dojo we actually just<br>hit our seventh earmark it's a really<br>interesting thing when you kind of think<br>about innovation and creativity and<br>problem-solving and an hour our business<br>for Jonah and I my co-founder really<br>formed out of out of this kind of whole<br>notion of how do you break things and<br>how do you make them better we met<br>working under Rob fight at in New<br>Zealand and and it was kind of it was<br>the first time that we had ever been<br>exposed to an organization of that scale<br>just really trying to transform how we<br>work and from there we've now had over a<br>thousand companies where ibas dojo which<br>is around about three and a half<br>thousand people and we're just about to<br>hit the 7000 square meter mark for our<br>business and so through this time period<br>what's what's been really interesting is<br>it's all about the human beings it's all<br>about the individuals and the people<br>that actually inhabit our environments<br>and as we saw in some of those slides<br>before the things that really resonate<br>with mirrors around diversity and<br>there's this kind of some interesting<br>kind of things that come out of<br>diversity our environments we try and<br>have as a kind of a mini laboratory to<br>kind of test how city might work our<br>spaces are very much in tune with the<br>breaking of the breakdown and the makeup<br>of the diverse communities that exist<br>within Auckland and we're always trying<br>to look at you know how do we be global<br>how do we be connected to the world and<br>one of the interesting things for us<br>around diversity is it actually builds<br>resilience it builds sustainability I<br>mean often we kind of see you know texts<br>going to lead the way but actually<br>technology is only as good as the<br>creatives who kind of challenged their<br>thinking I mean so much innovation over<br>the decades has come out of sci-fi you<br>know that's not scientists it would<br>necessarily behind their but crazy kind<br>of off-the-wall thinkers and one of the<br>things that I'm really impressed with<br>Auckland and and I guess I've got have<br>got a slightly different sort of<br>to you I've just recently three years<br>ago moved back down to Wellington after<br>been an orphan for ten years and the<br>thing that really stood out to me moving<br>back to Wellington was the fact that<br>most Aucklanders have a sense of global<br>kind of focus a lot of other regions in<br>New Zealand are often looking very<br>n-word and one of the things that really<br>stood out to me with a lot of people i<br>was talking to in Wellington is they<br>couldn't do business with someone unless<br>they could go and have a coffee with<br>them as against which is quite strange<br>or a craft beer as it might be now but<br>but in Auckland there was this real<br>sense if there's not enough work here<br>there's not enough business so I've got<br>to go global and you kind of get that<br>you walk along Queen Street you walk<br>along a road ponsonby and it feels like<br>an incredibly diverse it feels like a<br>very multicultural City and I think it's<br>a real strength Russ and I feel like we<br>really need to kind of hone in on that<br>more through our work with 80s who if we<br>had the pleasure of collaborating on<br>with the delivery of grid which was the<br>first of its kind and Australasia to be<br>delivered like this in innovation<br>strategy around how do you kind of drive<br>and grow more businesses and help<br>businesses scalar it's been has been one<br>heck of a journey I mean we've had<br>literally thousands of people a month<br>come through events over the last two<br>years I think we're just going to have<br>two years heaven when something like it<br>thanks fetch it and you know and with<br>the environment with grid down and when<br>yaar quarter its ended up being kind of<br>this mutual territory for universities<br>businesses corporates banks all sorts of<br>people to come together and go okay<br>we've got to connect we've got to share<br>these ideas we've got to kind of push<br>this stuff and I suppose the thing that<br>I really wanted to sort of focus on<br>today was was really around how do we<br>amplify more of that how do you guys<br>take more responsibility for that stuff<br>as well I mean you know it really does<br>sit with you and and how do we try and<br>push this level of creativity and growth<br>I mean one of the things that and this<br>is probably Rio stop waffling a little<br>bit but one of the things that really<br>stood out to me the other day and I was<br>just mentioning to the the other<br>speakers before we got honors I had this<br>epiphany on a flight to Christchurch for<br>the opening of our new space down there<br>where I realized that my business<br>partners and I sign leases for 20 years<br>and so I've<br>a personal guarantee for 20 years on a<br>site which is quite disconcerting being<br>that I'm going to be a lot older and and<br>I suddenly start thinking about you know<br>what is our responsibility around<br>creating prosperity in Auckland and<br>growing growing this economy here when<br>we start to think out like 5 10 15 20<br>years I mean how many of you think about<br>what life's like at that point I mean<br>most of us as business owners we kind of<br>any think sort of 90 days or 12 months<br>out often we don't really think beyond<br>that and one of the things that really<br>stood out to me on the trip to Israel<br>when you mentioned before was I got this<br>real sense of social responsibility from<br>a lot of Israeli business founders and<br>creators they really had a sense of like<br>my job as to create jobs for the future<br>for the next generation how do I create<br>prosperity for my grandkids not just<br>about how do i make wealth for me and I<br>came back and there's been obviously a<br>lot of stuff that's come out of that<br>tour and being you know really humbled<br>to be part of that experience and see<br>what Simon and spark and obviously the<br>other the other the members of that<br>group are trying to push New Zealand<br>forward around there and I think it's<br>not a silver bullet but it's awesome to<br>see that stuff coming together and so<br>many Auckland enterprise companies<br>actually getting in the mix on that I<br>think it's really really commendable and<br>very fortunate for all come to be able<br>to have that but you know I guess for<br>yourselves a few business owners do you<br>think about how do i create jobs and<br>walk when you know how to I create<br>prosperity for that next generation I<br>mean I is that something that anyone in<br>the room thinks about does anyone think<br>about it there you go there's a couple<br>we've got through four hands awesome<br>that's a little more than I thought and<br>and I think this is something that I<br>think if we're going to build this<br>innovative city or keep kind of pushing<br>this forward I think more of us need to<br>take responsibility ourselves to<br>actually move our businesses in that<br>direction we need to start thinking a<br>little further than 90 days a little<br>further than 12 months we need to think<br>about what our what our i guess i'm<br>going to use a sweat a lot but what our<br>responsibility is to the whole region<br>you know how do we create a more healthy<br>more vibrant city it's not just about<br>how we lead tech and how we create kind<br>of value because I mean San Francisco<br>amazing place<br>obviously not withstand an incredible<br>place but and I'd love to have some of<br>the stats and Auckland have some o stats<br>but they also have tremendous issues<br>with homelessness they have traditions<br>crime rates that is this you know it's<br>not all it's not all awesome and I think<br>you know Oakland has a unique<br>opportunity of being able to not only be<br>an incredibly creative for an innovative<br>city with so many universities<br>intertwined in the fabric of the city<br>but but also we've got a responsibility<br>to this population of people as to how<br>do we create a future for everyone and<br>and I guess I was just really wanting to<br>sort of kind of get that across to you<br>guys as well that you know I hope I go<br>to a lot of talks and obviously you guys<br>probably do too you know how do you go<br>home thinking about well what can my<br>mark be on Auckland's and what can I<br>take some responsibility for you know<br>how do you try and collaborate a little<br>bit more because we use that word a lot<br>we talk about it's all about<br>collaboration and community and coming<br>together but what does it all really<br>mean for us within biz dojo and<br>obviously within the work that 80's<br>doing with grid there has to be around<br>tangible connection there has to be a<br>mutual beneficial outcome for the<br>parties that are involved you know<br>someone who's got a problem<br>collaborating with someone else who's<br>got that you know got that solution<br>bringing those things together and<br>creating some genesis from that and then<br>trying to take their product to the<br>world I mean I think one of the<br>challenges we actually have in<br>auckland's and it's just a national<br>problem this isn't just isolated to<br>Auckland as kiwis just need to be a<br>little bit more motivated to take a bit<br>more risk you know we kind of we talk<br>about being an innovative culture we<br>talk about you know number eight wire<br>and that kind of thing but we do have a<br>tendency to kind of beat up on each<br>other if you kind of have a failure we<br>still do that a lot and you know and how<br>does Auckland try to reposition that<br>stuff so that we're not doing that so<br>much so it's less for me about saying<br>failures okay but more about going<br>before someone hits a wall how do we<br>actually get stuck in there and go home<br>a time going to help you with us before<br>that all turns to custard and you lose<br>your house and it all turns pear shape<br>how do we actually get involved in<br>intervene earlier<br>I think that some of the stuff that I<br>think we need to all take a bit more<br>responsibility and Oakland and do that I<br>guess thinking about the future and I'm<br>kind of just checking my time there I<br>love that you know thinking about the<br>future for Auckland's you know and I<br>come back to this idea around these<br>leases for 20 years and I think about<br>how do we be relevant in our business<br>for you know a six year old now one with<br>you know six year old and 20 years want<br>to come and work out Abbas dojo and<br>launch their idea and create it and it's<br>and I guess the big thing that we try<br>and talk to a lot of people about is<br>always always kind of this ebb and flow<br>of kind of how do you pivot all the time<br>how you always fine with us marketers<br>and looking to where it's going and I<br>think one of the big opportunities for<br>Aucklanders to try and kill this kind of<br>regional rhetoric that kind of goes<br>around and we've all experienced it it's<br>like dawkins fault or you know it's<br>Wellington's folder it's Christchurch as<br>filed or whatever it is there's always<br>beating up all the time but I think<br>Auckland is kind of like the big<br>powerhouse for the economy here we've<br>kind of got to really kind of knocked it<br>on its ear and go New Zealand needs to<br>rally together as a unit and actually<br>try and go for it on the world stage<br>because if we don't other countries are<br>they are very motivated to push forward<br>and we're just going to be kind of left<br>in the dust a little bit I won't end on<br>that really negative note so all the<br>time yeah look you know I love the fact<br>that these types of conversations and<br>these types of discussions are happening<br>because I think too often we think a<br>little bit to sort of short-sighted<br>we're a little bit we're a little bit<br>blind to what the actual real<br>opportunities are and how we kind of<br>work across sector and we work across<br>businesses more so I really love the<br>slides we were talking about that that<br>sense of diversity and and how we push<br>that and there is some amazing stuff<br>that comes out of all cleanse i mean you<br>know there's been some incredible<br>success stories of businesses that have<br>kind of taken their ideas to the world<br>and how do we replicate more of that I<br>mean one of the things that really stood<br>out for me again on their israel trip is<br>the fact that every founder that i spoke<br>to said this is a billion-dollar idea<br>i'm taking it to the world I'm not<br>validating it here in Israel it's I'm on<br>a plane<br>New York I'm on a plane sir wherever it<br>is and and I kind of feel like you know<br>if you're having conversations that are<br>with other founders and other creators<br>and those kind of things compel them to<br>get on a plane have some guts and push<br>themselves more you know I think that's<br>you know something we all need to try<br>and say to people as you know there's a<br>big world out there to the end of that<br>slide you know what's your piece of it<br>and then how do you kind of bring that<br>back and create more opportunity for new<br>zealand er of it so that's me waffle<br>complete</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
