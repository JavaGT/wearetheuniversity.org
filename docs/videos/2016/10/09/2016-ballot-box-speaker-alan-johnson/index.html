and thanks for<br>the great tuna DISA let you know by a<br>little bit more background I've come up<br>a sudden right away today to be here on<br>the son of South Auckland I grew up in<br>South Auckland of living south of for<br>most of my life and enables own proud<br>proud to say there now what I want to<br>talk today about as well have called a<br>vision south and want to offer you a<br>perspective so that quite i believe<br>shameful statistics around South<br>Auckland and the challenge that presents<br>us as a city to become more inclusive<br>City<br>I'm not certain where the slide card was<br>slight come from I think it's a joke and<br>that black people were rescued from<br>South Auckland but<br>basically they're open side<br>Benjamin Disraeli said this in the<br>Victorian England that he spoke of of<br>Britain and England and he said two<br>nations between whom there is no<br>intercourse no sympathy who are as<br>ignorant of each other's habits thoughts<br>and feelings as if they were dwellers<br>and different signs or inhabitants of<br>different planets the rich and the poor<br>and I think as a consequence of the work<br>that time Thomas Piketty is done with<br>respect to rising inequality analysis in<br>a global society I think we tracing way<br>back to that sort of environment that we<br>have two sets of people who are<br>completely ignorant of how the other<br>part lives<br>chef Aucklanders to a degree perhaps us<br>a place in your mind rather than a place<br>on the map and it's not well defined by<br>a particular sort of geography but I<br>would suggest to you that includes of<br>six subs or tahoe humanity perpetuate we<br>alter money though which is my home<br>subject<br>and Papa cooter what I've done is just<br>taking some images of the various some<br>parts of that of that place and and this<br>image here which can't point to you yeah<br>image on the top right hand corner is an<br>image of my favorite football team them<br>the mighty Monday with marvins who I<br>must say the woman are playing in the<br>grand final a ton mal smart stadium on<br>itself<br>South Auckland is quite the six suburbs<br>of settlement quite different ethnically<br>but overall Pacifica people Pacific<br>people are the most numerous making up<br>something like forty percent of that<br>population<br>European Park er perhaps surprisingly<br>make up the second-biggest ethnic group<br>and Marley and Asian people more broadly<br>defined<br>make up the rest in equal measure it's<br>interesting to note too that one-third<br>or more Pacific people who live in New<br>Zealand livin stand the no six subjects<br>so it is a predominately able to civic<br>place but it's not entirely and one of<br>the things you notices if you had time<br>to add up all those percentages add up<br>to more than hundred percent because of<br>course that multi-ethnicity to people<br>identify with and there's a specially a<br>characteristic of South or<br>one of there are several things here is<br>just indicators of summer challenges we<br>face in South Auckland fiercely talking<br>about our declining homeownership just<br>under one-half of households in the 2013<br>census where owned by the occupiers as<br>compared with about thirty five percent<br>of d six percent of the rest of Auckland<br>so you can see that that South<br>Aucklanders are predominantly a tenant<br>community it doesn't have as much<br>control over its of environment as many<br>other suburbs and communities do and in<br>fact the rate of which home ownership<br>was being converted into<br>investment-driven rental property as two<br>and a half three times what it was you<br>were in UCL and Oakland if we look at<br>the number of houses even built in south<br>or relatives the number of people that<br>have moved there or been born there we<br>find that with over the last five years<br>and so that we've built one house for<br>every seventh people compared to one<br>house for every four people across the<br>rest of New Zealand about one house for<br>every two and a half people across New<br>Zealand so is it any wonder that we're<br>now starting to see that the pressure on<br>their housing stock starting to spill<br>over was literally people living in<br>doorways sleeping cars with their<br>children and car parks it's a<br>consequence of of the serious neglect<br>over the last ten years really to<br>actually provide any affordable housing<br>in South Auckland looking at crime rates<br>one of the things and it's difficult now<br>to identify<br>closely crime figures because of the way<br>that the states have changed a bit but<br>and and of course we know too that only<br>probably around about a third less of<br>crimes actually reported particularly<br>serious assaults so what we're seeing<br>here in the reporting crime is a tip of<br>the iceberg but we know that and some<br>parts of South Auckland and in<br>particular<br>that the police district doesn't divide<br>up several the quote as I would like it<br>so you've got to take pics of some<br>police districts in any more together<br>but the two the two more central ones a<br>Counties Manukau western counties<br>manukau central and and the chances of<br>recording an assault on those in those<br>places is twice the rate that it is in<br>the rest of Auckland and at least one<br>and a half times the rate for the whole<br>of chance manicure district similarly<br>record a break ins and nearly sixty<br>percent higher so this is a place as we<br>probably know and there was a headline<br>and here here or today a better a youth<br>fight in the streets of my least those<br>are pretty common representations of<br>South Auckland and it's regrettable but<br>that's in some respects the lived<br>experience of many people and they have<br>to say most of us ours angry about<br>theirs wouldn't be a few lovely we<br>certainly don't normalize the concept is<br>just how we have to load and if we look<br>at lakes of you to finding of the youth<br>and South Auckland probably fifty<br>percent more likely to be apprehended<br>for an offense whether that's because<br>the police are better at apprehending<br>criminals and South Auckland orders<br>because there's morphine addict over the<br>reality is that we have a significant<br>relative problem with youth offending<br>now and our suburbs then we pass them to<br>pass rates and NCAA twice as many South<br>Auckland secondary school students leave<br>leave school without the NCAA level one<br>then the rest of Auckland and if we look<br>at the top in the pins of there are<br>three and entry into places like like<br>like this the rate of South Auckland<br>students achieving at number three in<br>cas burning two-thirds of one of those<br>for the rest of walking so we find that<br>out our young people face significant<br>disadvantages and it's no wonder because<br>this this graph shows the distribution<br>of students by decile in the schools<br>you'd expect obviously in a lovely<br>normal world that there is a tempest in<br>each dsr but you find fifty-five percent<br>of South Auckland children go to a dis<br>old one school<br>and total 76 77 bicego to this on one to<br>school and of all the children attending<br>this I one stunna to schools in South<br>Auckland and an Auckland 72 cents<br>seventy-seven percent of them love and<br>settled and only to Percy<br>one-point-eight percent in fact of<br>children who are attending additional<br>nine and ten school go to school in<br>South Auckland and that includes King's<br>College which art which which is<br>actually example so you take King's<br>College is almost nobody about 200 kids<br>attended this online attend school so it<br>shows you just how concentrated this<br>inequality and this and this<br>disadvantage actually is the whole<br>series of things you could talk about<br>with respect to that as to what happens<br>to children to go to those schools and<br>why but it's a simple fact that there is<br>a huge concentration of poor aucklanders<br>into these subjects I<br>just want to end with with a comic that<br>time that young teammate and a speech he<br>made in 2007 he said we are seeing a<br>dangerous drift towards social and<br>economic exclusion I know we can do<br>better said we have to do better because<br>left unchecked the problems of a growing<br>underclass affect all of us<br>and I just want to leave with that as an<br>issue whether or not mr. keys policies I<br>have subsequently addressed as<br>challenges clearly something we might<br>debate tonight the reality is that i<br>certainly agree with that with that<br>analysis and what I'd like to do is to<br>offer three things a fourth core ideas<br>for us to become a more inclusive order<br>for me it seems unlikely that South<br>Auckland will be included in the wider<br>and wider and wider the wider or may<br>have life and until we make significant<br>progress on the following three things<br>one is that we addressed entrenched<br>education disadvantage including middle<br>class privilege within the education<br>system secondly that we ensure that no<br>young person auckland wide not distance<br>out of the leaf educational training<br>with that job serie that we we begin<br>with such seriousness rather than empty<br>rhetoric to provide housing which is<br>affordable safe and secure and finally<br>that we accept that if we want to live<br>in poverty that we can do need to pay<br>the decent living waiters and all of an<br>order for them to support the family<br>those are the four ideas I want to leave<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
