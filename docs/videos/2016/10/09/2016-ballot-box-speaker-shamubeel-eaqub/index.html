thank you all for<br>coming out it's a very big topic and<br>inequality is not something that we can<br>talk about easily but before we start<br>talking about inequality I think we have<br>to start with the position of Auckland<br>is an amazing city it has huge amount of<br>potential and there are many<br>opportunities so we're not starting from<br>a place of no hope but place fulfilled<br>apart but clearly in the knowledge that<br>things are not perfect one of the<br>biggest issues is even though Auckland<br>is growing even though there are more<br>jobs and incomes on average arising<br>what's absolutely clear is that the<br>rising tide is not lifting and<br>ultimately it is around the aspects of<br>it aspects of that exclusion that is<br>where we have to really focus on we know<br>that the reasons why there is this<br>exclusion and there's differences that<br>are growing some of them are outside of<br>control but there also some that are as<br>a result of policies and policy neglect<br>that we have had for the last 30 odd<br>years in my mind Oakland is a city that<br>is increasingly divided when we look at<br>it for those who have good jobs versus<br>recharge those who have short commutes<br>to work versus pedant<br>those who own about vs. who died and the<br>statistics that Alan talked about I<br>think highlighted that not only are<br>these gaps real but in many cases these<br>gaps are drawn within juror fees over<br>city that we are creating different<br>parts of Auckland that are in fact not<br>talking to each other I love the quote<br>that you started with Helen because I<br>think it really spoke volumes in terms<br>of where we are starting from right now<br>there is such an exclusion between the<br>rich and poor in New Zealand that we<br>cannot empathize with the pain and<br>suffering that's going<br>we're more likely to blame them for<br>being poor we're more likely to punish<br>them for being homeless and we're more<br>likely to penalize and be happy with a<br>system that is grudging and unfair but<br>we also know that not everything is<br>because of horses and we have to know<br>that the backdrop of what is happening<br>in terms of the differences and the<br>growing gaps that we see across New<br>Zealand a lot of it is because of things<br>that are completely outside of the<br>control brexit for me was a moment of<br>watershed what it showed was the<br>inequalities that are growing within our<br>communities and now have gotten so big<br>that the excluded are not the majority<br>and this really matters because for me<br>grexit was very much a vote against<br>globalization a vote begins new<br>liberalism it was a vote against growth<br>in some cases and it was also a vote of<br>old versus the young of the educated<br>versus the uneducated it was the<br>provinces versus the cities not just in<br>New Zealand not just in Auckland we're<br>living in a community that is divided<br>and those differences really matter when<br>I think about the forces that are<br>creating the changes it's very much<br>around the big shifts in technology<br>globalization which we'll talk about in<br>the upcoming series and I encourage you<br>to go and engage with those because I<br>think the drivers of it are<br>extraordinary but today what we're<br>talking about is the result of those<br>changes and the result of those changes<br>is our labor markets have become more<br>polarized our cities are defined by very<br>highly skilled jobs and very unskilled<br>jobs and it's those that polarization<br>between skills between incomes between<br>between job opportunities<br>and essentially your access to quality<br>of life the middle is hollowing and this<br>really matters<br>the richer educated increased live<br>increasingly segregated parts of<br>Auckland the last census was quite<br>interesting to see because what we saw<br>was poverty was being concentrated in<br>certain parts of opened genuinely far<br>away from services is far away from<br>amenities we could be kind about why<br>that is happening but we think I think<br>we know what we should call it it is<br>called the ghettoization of Auckland and<br>it is completely unacceptable a lot of<br>what is happening in terms of this<br>ghettoization is not just because of the<br>insecurity that we see in the labour<br>market whether in terms of the types of<br>jobs or what it takes to participate in<br>the high end jobs it's also about a<br>housing market that is fundamentally<br>broken our Prime Minister was on radio a<br>couple of days ago saying that it's<br>always been hard for people to buy<br>houses in Auckland when you've<br>got this kind of denial when the average<br>house price in Auckland is a million<br>dollars is ridiculous<br>we've got politicians bickering over<br>whether we should call it a challenge or<br>a crisis I don't care we just need to<br>fix it housing has become so expensive<br>that it is having serious consequences<br>on the quality of people's lives and is<br>creating big differences that are<br>becoming more more entrenched not only<br>across generations but between<br>communities and across communities we<br>know that what's been happening in terms<br>of this inequality of housing is not<br>something that's going to be solved<br>quickly this is something that's been<br>growing for many<br>when we look at the falling<br>homeownership rate in New Zealand<br>whether it's in South Auckland or across<br>New Zealand it really all started in the<br>early 1990s which was the peak of<br>homeownership rate in New Zealand and it<br>has been falling since then today is the<br>lowest rate since 1956 so this is not a<br>crisis that is new this is not a crisis<br>that is about what has happened in the<br>last five years of the last ten years<br>this is something that has been the<br>result of policy failures that have<br>cumulated over many decades the mistakes<br>are old the blame has to be shared<br>across many and the solutions have to be<br>across many different things one of the<br>biggest frustrations for me is that when<br>we talk about housing or education all<br>orang welfare people present one<br>solution one single way of fixing things<br>and the reality is there are no simple<br>fixes the complexity of the drivers of<br>where and how we have got the<br>inequalities in our city are massive and<br>they're hard to unpack and that's why<br>they are hard to solve but it doesn't<br>mean that we should engage in a in a<br>practice of playing for one group quite<br>often it is the council because they're<br>very easy to blame their communications<br>team is not very good at fighting back<br>it's about the building sector because<br>they don't do enough it's about the land<br>bankers is about social housing with not<br>building enough social housing it's<br>about renting policies that are rubbish<br>it's about tax policies that are rubbish<br>it's about forums we like that one in<br>particular<br>it's about migrants it's about all of<br>those things and the reality is that it<br>doesn't matter what the reason is we<br>know there is enough worker out there<br>for us to know that we kind of<br>understand what's happening in the<br>housing market it's really complex it's<br>a lot of different drivers and we have<br>to do a lot of things to fix it but we<br>also know the consequence of that is<br>quite significant not only I was seeing<br>that in terms of the rising<br>the poor in our society and we've seen<br>that this year with the rising media<br>reporting of homelessness but we also<br>know that there's increasing pressures<br>on young workers in a city like Oakland<br>for teachers for teachers aides for<br>nurses for police for all of those<br>services it is becoming harder and<br>harder Oakland has the highest average<br>household income of all the regions in<br>New Zealand<br>wants it to take you into account<br>they're buying the dreamland of<br>million-dollar average house the<br>disposable income is the lowest of all<br>our regions Auckland's meant to be our<br>most competitive city this is meant to<br>be our one big hub of competing with<br>cities around the world how are we going<br>to do it when we can't even give enough<br>disposable income for people in this<br>city even with very good incomes to live<br>their lives in dignity the inequalities<br>that we're opening up are opening up<br>across so many different lines these<br>four lines are going to become massive<br>we're going to be affecting the quality<br>of life our ability to offer services<br>our cities compared deafness we're going<br>to see increasing ghettoization and<br>gated communities amongst the rich this<br>is no new zealand by only living and the<br>challenges of growing gaps and<br>separation there won't be easy to solve<br>but we also know what the solutions are<br>and i think the technical solutions are<br>not where their problem is that is not<br>the roadblock that is not the challenge<br>the challenge is where we start from we<br>know that education has to be improved<br>and Alan he had some great ideas there<br>and one of the biggest tragedies that I<br>see is the differences in terms of<br>education outcomes across ethnicities<br>across geography<br>patients across family backgrounds<br>across access to housing whether you're<br>renting versus owning all of these<br>things are not new and not Nora the new<br>or different for New Zealand they were<br>not unique and neither are the solutions<br>for me that mechanics are not the<br>problem for me the problem is always the<br>politics why and what values do we hold<br>ourselves up to how do we measure<br>ourselves and what is it that we want<br>for our society over the last 30 years<br>we have placed competition and<br>individualism on a pedestal we judge<br>people and ourselves and society amongst<br>metrics that I think make us<br>extraordinary selfish and it makes us<br>very difficult to care about others and<br>the natural result of it has been<br>massive massive carving out of<br>communities exclusion whether is drawn<br>across the lines of ethnicity or poverty<br>or education of where you live what car<br>you drive whatever it might be<br>ultimately the conditions that we have<br>today for politics is not conducive to<br>collectivism it is not conducive to<br>caring and certainly it is not conducive<br>to having the word love in the<br>conversation<br>ultimately I think what we're seeing<br>with inequality is an acceptance that<br>it's okay for people to miss out I worry<br>because what we are seeing in Oakland is<br>that it is not going to be okay because<br>very soon it will be the majority who<br>are excluded if we don't want to live in<br>a city and a society that is wrapped by<br>jealousy and by hatred and but division<br>and exclusion the only way that we can<br>overcome it is not with economics not<br>with public policy but with politics<br>that embraces a much different way of<br>doing things we know what to do what we<br>need is leadership and we need to have a<br>caring attitude to actually fixing<br>issues there have been so clearly in<br>front of us and growing for the last<br>days<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
