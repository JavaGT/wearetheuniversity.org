spend my time looking<br>at social policy from a national<br>perspective and I don't know much about<br>what goes on and local government policy<br>area and I guess to the traditional way<br>of looking at public finance is that it<br>is central government's responsibility<br>to redistribute to achieve fairer income<br>and wealth outcomes and its local<br>government's job to administer the city<br>the city of Fort Lee but what we see in<br>Auckland and the previous speakers have<br>outlined us is we see writ large the<br>failures of national policy the issues<br>are in the face and they're injured so<br>while I think that there are things that<br>local government can do to ameliorate<br>inequality central government needs to<br>take prime responsibility and we have<br>remind them of that responsibility so<br>well fashioning city requires that<br>people have sufficient income and a<br>secure asset base so it shops and cafes<br>kind of flourish people can get around<br>see the flow of money can keep going<br>around but what we have is has been<br>described as a two-speed city so on one<br>hand we've got real housewives and on<br>the other end we've got the desperately<br>who are families living in a house in<br>the middle of winter and the I on the<br>other hand of Auckland are immune to the<br>price system that just doesn't matter<br>what things cost do they know the price<br>of milk at the other end lives are spent<br>economizing on miserable and<br>insufficient disposable incomes where<br>every last ten cents and debris price<br>rise matters so I don't want to leave<br>the government the central government<br>off the hook tonight how do we get this<br>to speed City mother's a receptor and a<br>family impulse began in 1980s when the<br>rod genomics revolution was beginning<br>the essence of that policy was to<br>promote competition drive down wages<br>make us more competitive small<br>government user pays low tax and social<br>assistance to be only for the poor<br>meaning that social assistance was to be<br>targeted such targeting worried Treasury<br>greatly because they were aware of the<br>effect of marginal tax rate problem<br>which is when someone ends an extra<br>dollar they know how to play tax but<br>they lose access to social provision<br>event and education of or transfers and<br>are left with very little disposable<br>income I think xterra well despite how<br>Oakland has very low disposable and cars<br>well of course after all these are<br>offsets it's even worse than that the<br>policy Raja nomics policy reached its<br>zenith in the 1991 budget whereas<br>claimed that the nasty side effects of<br>high effective marginal tax rates had a<br>technocratic solution so social benefits<br>with cut social worker benefits when cut<br>and families were to have this social<br>provision aggregated onto a smart card<br>bled out at a uniform rate and the<br>effect of marginal tax rate problem was<br>to be solved as a young researcher I was<br>deeply troubled by this and not at all<br>surprised when their technocratic<br>silesia proved unworkable they had to<br>walk away from it it was abandoned and<br>that was shocking because what we were<br>left with was the overlapping effect of<br>marginal tax rate problem in the deep<br>poverty so what we saw from the<br>beginning of the 90s was a bread rise<br>defending<br>and of course associated things like<br>rise in the use of food bags in 1992 I<br>was asked along with others including<br>blue threat its own Michael Palin Rodney<br>hard to write an article for the<br>Dominion Post I was expected to look<br>forward to hear 2,000 to see where the<br>country was going and my contribution<br>was decried as being unduly pessimistic<br>and it gives me no pleasure to read that<br>I wrote that we were going to have in<br>the early part of the century a problem<br>with the disposable income of people<br>were left with after all of these<br>offsets through the targeting social<br>provision and I also wrote we have no<br>cable against tax and now no death<br>duties so there are a few leaders in<br>place to prevent further widening of the<br>income and wealth distribution such<br>policies also leave us ill equipped to<br>moderate another share market an asset<br>boom so I saw that the challenge was<br>going to be that technological change<br>would be destroying jobs the labor<br>market opportunities and the proportion<br>of national any unpaid wages likely to<br>continue to decline ownership a<br>productive<br>it's becoming more concentrated and I<br>said by the year 2000 we may need to<br>abandon the idea that hard work and<br>savings should be the basis of<br>redistribution of distribution the<br>fundamental challenge will be to find<br>ways of redistributing non-leather info<br>in order to maintain demand and prevent<br>poverty and alienation the government<br>did not rise to that challenge we are<br>now 25 years on from the 1991 budget and<br>a large part of the Auckland population<br>of paying a very heavy price for those<br>disastrous policies of 1991 what article<br>would I write today about women have<br>been ten years time many families are<br>repaying large student debts at twelve<br>percent above the tiny income they lose<br>working for families that's been<br>incredibly hard down and the new<br>subsidies for things like childcare an<br>accommodation supplement leaving very<br>little disposable income for any extra<br>innings than they have I belong to the<br>child poverty Action Group and for the<br>last 17 years we have run post-budget<br>breakfast up and down a new zealand and<br>every year the years has got a bit worse<br>we keep an eye on indicators such as<br>trends and third wheel diseases things<br>like dental extractions for children<br>under the age of three and the use of<br>food bags in Auckland one of the key<br>barometers of distress as the demand<br>food parcels at the organ city mission<br>since the early 1990s the growth has<br>been steadily upwards doubling over the<br>last six years and i was updating these<br>figures recently and i looked at the<br>challenge december to December the<br>monthly figures and the last monthly<br>changed between december 14 and december<br>15 was fifty percent and last Christmas<br>you might recall we had people spilling<br>out onto the road queuing some of them<br>all night to get the basics what are we<br>going to be looking at next year or in<br>ten years time the state of homelessness<br>in Queen Street is in grave danger<br>behind normalized normalized overseas<br>papers like The Guardian and UK having a<br>field day highlighting the extremities<br>of what we are allowing to happen in<br>Auckland to live happily in the city<br>people must have no money and they must<br>have enough time and aucklanders many<br>Aucklanders are failing to have either<br>of those two but when I look at the<br>older population I see that they're<br>doing a bit better than your own<br>families the support of programs for the<br>old wage linked new zealand<br>superannuation and the gold card<br>facilitating travel around Auckland are<br>good policies they're good for all kind<br>they help inclusivity in Auckland the<br>continual erosion of social welfare<br>benefits and programs like<br>families and the accommodation<br>supplement are not good for Auckland we<br>have student incomes that are too low<br>and require far far more support we have<br>students showing up at food baths we<br>have students who can't afford to come<br>into this university because of the cost<br>of travel so maybe at the local level we<br>can look at ameliorating some of these<br>problems with local policies but<br>ultimately we have to we have to support<br>these policies from the center if<br>Auckland is de function better and not<br>worse in 10 years time I thought we've<br>got to tackle wealth disparity with<br>proper tax reform it does not bear<br>you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
