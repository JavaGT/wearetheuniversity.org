namiko Takata my bday<br>karna ironic acronym re hernia talk<br>lengua Harry Avenue not far Aaron I dara<br>katakana Marta father him in my own<br>hockey acordo de na koto then I called<br>the tena koutou katoa it's indeed a<br>privilege for gajapati to be here today<br>I stand here as ring Maddie the<br>individual but I stand proudly as a<br>descendant of the notifier of people and<br>what we are here to talk about today is<br>Tamaki the inclusive City that's an<br>interesting one because my people have<br>been here for 350 years on the shores of<br>the way to Mathare we have been based in<br>all our case for many many years and<br>today we still stand and it was an<br>interesting time because in 1840 through<br>the through the courage and what I think<br>leadership shall avail talked about a<br>lien sister went to call Erica and<br>invited governor Hobson to come and<br>settle in Taranaki makoto and when he<br>when they as they went to bring the<br>governor Hopsin down they invited<br>governor Hobson and the administration<br>on to the source of the way to Mathare<br>on to come boo and from that day we<br>believe we believe their inclusion<br>started actually it's that day that we<br>believe that its partnership came to be<br>and we think that that was the basis of<br>inclusion in this beautiful city of<br>Tamaki the other point that I want to<br>make is for us for notify to tie Rakhi<br>Makoto has a right to live its name<br>tamaki Makoto is not Auckland the most<br>livable city tamaki Makoto is translated<br>as Tamaki loved by many it is the most<br>lovable city and its everybody's<br>everybody's rolled who chooses to live<br>and love and the struggling to actually<br>go to these to these beautiful lands of<br>Tamaki to make it so we don't think that<br>tamaki has got there quite yet but we<br>think that there is a potential for it<br>to be so so it's not right from now to<br>try to us view that inequality exists<br>it's not right that poverty is becoming<br>a reality whether or not you want to<br>call it a crisis or a challenge i had<br>only Ellen's already shown to the<br>results and we live it we see it and<br>smell it we breathe in every other day<br>but what is it that ring Maddie you<br>wanted to talk about for the next eight<br>minutes actually and I've got to be<br>pretty cool so I got my two babies<br>watching and listening to their mother<br>talk about something that's dear to<br>their hearts I can't get it to wrong<br>what I want to talk about is how a<br>community takes takes control of<br>circumstance in to me that probably the<br>most important element of getting this<br>right you cannot do something to a<br>community you must enable a community to<br>take control of its destiny nite sprite<br>or has had a checkered history in 1951<br>we were virtually memphis on the shores<br>of all coffee bow and we were left with<br>after the whole of atomic in within five<br>years we lost most of our tribal answer<br>by violence 45 degrees virtually endless<br>and by 1950 1951 we had a quarter acre<br>and that quarter our cabin was our<br>signature now this isn't too long ago<br>because my mother's sitting in there and<br>the audience and mum was born in 54 so<br>we're not talking about something that's<br>so distant from anybody and it's not so<br>distant from my two children who are<br>sitting here in the back row but what is<br>interesting is how over two generations<br>their landscaping that narrative can<br>challenge Nyjah Farah was virtually<br>Venice not too far to a wasn't poverty<br>90 fire had suffered however today we<br>will post a bearing of over 900 million<br>dollars in two generations and what I<br>want to talk about actually is taking<br>control of that circumstance and a post<br>siedel of an environment how do we do<br>that you know we've got an uncle and<br>godfather and their corners neighbors<br>Molly and he says none but ourselves can<br>free our arms and I would like to think<br>that we have hits involved and<br>courageous leadership to enable that to<br>occur some one of the things that we<br>have done and it was funny was broadly<br>serum Annie do you think you can talk<br>about this program that you've been<br>doing I wasn't talking about it but I<br>love it so I'm going to I'm going to<br>boast about it till the cows come home<br>we have just completed a project and it<br>is called kinda to a day so you'll see<br>up the image fragile arcade kinder to a<br>day and Marty the word kinda means home<br>to it that he means first and I was on<br>the board of much trouble okay photo op<br>working on my car and what we decided<br>was that we were going to do this<br>straight out of post-settlement we were<br>going to make a change to the landscape<br>and what we were going to do is invest<br>our own money our own energy and our<br>resource and creating our own future and<br>that's what we did in the past we've had<br>about three different developments at<br>all dark<br>housing developments nobody would give<br>us any money so house in New Zealand<br>decided in the house I live exactly<br>actually will give you some money I'll<br>give you 125 thousand dollars but we'll<br>build your house and stilts because we<br>just can't trust you I have to pay it<br>back so when you decide to default we<br>get out of chainsaw will take your house<br>our on stilts and off we go however what<br>we decided as we're not we don't want to<br>do that anymore and we went to the bank<br>and we said to them go to build these<br>homes they're going to be on public are<br>you man their own tribe leone blend the<br>people who live in lives that I almost<br>home to never owned the land that belong<br>to the people or do you give us some<br>money not one bank in this country<br>refused notify to that one which means<br>that we had the ability to do all the<br>design and apply policies that I think<br>have been alluded to today here is what<br>our homes look like and<br>we pretty stoked about this we have<br>built 30 homes 30 brand new homes cost<br>the nitrile darchei is 15 million dots<br>we have become the bank we have allowed<br>30 families to come and we've been<br>privileged actually and to invite 30<br>families back onto our tribal land we<br>owned some state houses there were ten<br>we pulled those down and we replace them<br>with 30 what you will find in this<br>particular development they are all<br>tribal descendants 26 out of 30 of<br>through time homeowners and 10 out of 30<br>are first-generation homeowners what<br>will also see in this is that on the<br>same piece of land that we used to have<br>two bedroom state houses on we have now<br>gone from ten my cassette teen dwellings<br>and about 30 people to 30 dwellings and<br>150 so we have created a medium density<br>solution to allow not only home<br>ownership but equally to bring people<br>back onto the tribal lands and to<br>connect with your community because it<br>is their ancestor right to be amongst<br>their community and to be loved and to<br>looked after collectively<br>what we have also done is said that it<br>is an appropriate and it's not on their<br>actual would be going would be raised<br>and cold damp and moldy homes so we've<br>built our housing policy around our kids<br>and we have absolutely no shame in doing<br>that so we have made sure that we have<br>got the best materials here to keep our<br>babies beer babies warm what we do know<br>too is that since we've opened these<br>homes the number of children who have<br>gone on to the to their medical clinics<br>because we also have GP clinics the<br>reduction in preventable illnesses<br>around rheumatic fever around cellulitis<br>and around moldy you know those things<br>that are incidents of actually molded<br>cold and deer pipes has reduced<br>significantly and what we're also seeing<br>2 is that to own homes you must have<br>employment so we are changing the social<br>indices and landscape around artifacts<br>because we have 30 families and 150<br>people who actually come from homes<br>where employment as the norm and that is<br>creating a ripple effect in this<br>community that no government policy<br>actually could ever do because the<br>community has decided that that's what<br>it wants the other beautiful part about<br>this is not just the economics not just<br>the way that a tribe and visa nuts are<br>people it's also around culture what we<br>know in connoisseur he is that of those<br>homes at least a half of those homes can<br>speak Marty which means we have nearly<br>doubled the amount of people in our<br>community who speak Marty is their first<br>language that's hot in my view of the<br>world is the chief executive of our<br>tribal development are we're also<br>finding that the the quality of the home<br>as significant so we have just one and<br>tears of the building we have just one<br>property awards and the use general<br>property council we've also won some<br>architecture awards are born offshore we<br>have used the absolute best in terms of<br>the materials to ensure that they last<br>longer than 50 years we've also we've<br>also inserted what we call a put option<br>because even though I forgets the center<br>of our universe the chances are some<br>families may choose to leave so how do<br>we ensure that they can extract equity<br>and move on to other bigger and brighter<br>things other I don't know why you would<br>but see something as well and we have<br>provided that that opportunity there and<br>finally in my last 40 seconds I just<br>want you to have a look picture<br>here is one of the homes that we've got<br>here this is you'll see that we've also<br>used all of our native we've got a<br>nursery and we've got one of the one of<br>a few I think organic nurseries in the<br>city and we have done all the<br>landscaping work there we have try to<br>apply our views to sustainability in the<br>terms of what we do in stormwater and<br>how we protect what goes out into the<br>waiting apart and you'll see all of that<br>is being affected into our design so<br>it's not just about the insights about<br>the outside as well and how we look<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
