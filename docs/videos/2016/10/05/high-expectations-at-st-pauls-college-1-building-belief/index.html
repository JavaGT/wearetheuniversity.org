font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so high expectations is something that<br>teachers would have heard a lot of you<br>need to have high expectations of your<br>students um but I think putting it into<br>practice has been more challenging for<br>people and the concept of high<br>expectations um which has come about<br>through a lot of research is that um has<br>a couple of key principles and one is<br>that you've got to have a lot of care<br>for your students um so it's about<br>building relationships and building<br>trust and then the second part is about<br>providing um multiple Advanced<br>opportunities for learning which often<br>teachers don't realize they're not doing<br>low expectations would mean that<br>students do not develop the schools to<br>think for themselves they'll see<br>learning probably as knowing the right<br>answer not that there might be more than<br>one answer or it's about justifying the<br>answer or thinking more critically about<br>what you're doing so those are the<br>opportunities they miss and um with<br>today's like climate of change<br>everywhere everything's changing so<br>rapidly actually we need to be<br>developing those skills in our students<br>so they' got a better chance to cope<br>with what's ahead the presentation I<br>gave to the teachers to start building<br>the belief around high expectations and<br>exposing them to those ideas was partly<br>the research and so the background that<br>I've just explained and the second part<br>was actually my own inquiry so as a<br>teacher the most recent inquiry I did<br>into my practice using the high<br>expectations model and um I had good<br>relationships with my students already<br>so I was really focusing on providing<br>multiple um Advanced opportunities to<br>learn and so I shared that with them I<br>showed the statistics of what the<br>students had done in their previous year<br>um gave them some examples of the<br>different things we did and then was<br>able to show the increase in student<br>achievement and one of the things I<br>think that stood out the most was the<br>number of students in my class that<br>wen't my target group also had big<br>improvements um so I think that was a<br>significant<br>thing yeah I thought the uh building<br>belief um presentation was really<br>insightful and thought-provoking um it<br>was good to have someone experienced in<br>it uh come to talk to us um I think as<br>teachers were creatures of habit so it's<br>always good to have an outside voice um<br>and new voice uh being able to explain<br>it to us a part of high expectations<br>teaching itself is that you believe you<br>can make a difference for the students I<br>think if you don't believe in it then<br>you will might try something out of<br>compliance but you don't understand or<br>get the reason behind it so you don't<br>really have that ownership going<br>in the high expectations building belief<br>uh presentation uh changed my way of<br>thinking in terms of giving my students<br>the chance to think giving them<br>opportunities with within the classroom<br>to think I think as teachers we all have<br>high expectations but I think for me uh<br>it was recognizing and developing<br>opportunities to uh see higher order<br>thinking um through my teaching we very<br>aware that students will have all sorts<br>of things going on in their lives that<br>might make it harder for them to learn<br>but it's about the teacher having the<br>belief that while they're with me I can<br>make a difference for those students and<br>that's really underpins high</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
