die lonely a recent extensive<br>study from the University of York<br>comprehensively evidenced that people<br>living in social isolation are more<br>likely to experience a chronic and<br>terminal metal medical conditions the<br>experience of loneliness makes us more<br>susceptible to death the same study<br>identified that dance activities are one<br>of the best ways to socialize and stave<br>off such conditions and only death is<br>not the only problem that emerges from<br>social isolation study after study<br>indicate the impact of social alienation<br>on health security education and the<br>economy social alienation in school<br>leads to low engagement with learning<br>leads to low achievement social<br>alienation in society leads to crime<br>terrorism and suicide social alienation<br>within workplaces leads to low<br>productivity and low employability<br>alternatively individuals who can<br>effectively communicate collaborate and<br>collectively innovate are the most<br>sought-after with in employment markets<br>so what does all of this have to do with<br>read my research and dance studies today<br>I'm going to illustrate this in<br>association with three words community<br>creativity and refuge my research<br>focuses on dance and how the creative<br>moving body can foster a sense of<br>belonging social interaction can be<br>intimidating who has not felt<br>uncomfortable the first time they enter<br>a classroom a playground a workplace a<br>prison a retirement home a refugee camp<br>a new country a cocktail party<br>an academic symposium I know that um<br>I've felt intimidated and so that's why<br>I research it so how does one gain a<br>sense of belonging and acceptance for<br>some it will be through words listening<br>and talking for many however words<br>languages discourses will be the<br>intimidating block that is causing the<br>discomfort and sense of dislocation<br>dance is not the only alternative to<br>words but it is one it's one that I<br>practice and so I research through it<br>dance can help us to feel comfortable in<br>our own bodies feel comfortable<br>surrounded by other bodies feel<br>comfortable with ideas feel comfortable<br>with our physical environments my dad's<br>research focuses on how dance can foster<br>community creativity and refuge dance<br>can allow us to commune through dancing<br>we can negotiate the norms and<br>distinctions that help identify and<br>reinforce a sense of community dance a<br>lap can allow us to feel creative<br>through dancing we can generate and<br>contribute to culture within such a<br>community feel a sense of agency and not<br>simply replicate culture dance can<br>provide a refuge through dancing<br>individuals can gain a sense of<br>inclusion amongst others a sense that<br>they belong and that their presence is<br>valued research that I've been involved<br>in as evidence that dance practices can<br>foster both social inclusion and social<br>exclusion it has shown that dance<br>education has empowered learners and<br>demeaned learners dance has connected<br>people to their bodies and others and<br>further alienated people from others and<br>their bodies the world is full of people<br>with good intentions artists educators<br>community activists social workers<br>business leaders healthcare<br>professionals security professionals who<br>want to use dance to support people and<br>society their practices do not always<br>achieve those good intentions however<br>often it is because they do not<br>recognize the complexity of those good<br>intentions<br>so I work with researchers that are<br>investigating these practices they are<br>asking how questions like how am I to<br>dance class help an elderly woman stave<br>off Alzheimer's how might a dance<br>production help a young refugee to feel<br>a sense of future in a strange land how<br>might a dance workshop bring a group of<br>employees into a more cooperative sense<br>of mind how am I dance inside of a<br>curriculum hope a teenage boy if Elodie<br>is valued at school how am I a dance<br>session allow a young woman in prison to<br>a value her body and sustain a sense of<br>self-worth how might a dance activity<br>allow a child with autism to communicate<br>through partnerships with researchers in<br>education Social Work Maori studies<br>Pacific studies health and medical<br>sciences and business and economics this<br>research is releasing possibilities they<br>cannot simply be achieved through<br>medication legislation strategic<br>direction formal education verbal<br>mediation or economic repatriation I<br>spent eight years living in the West<br>Bank and Gaza Strip investigating how<br>dance may support traumatized<br>communities there but I also recognize<br>that we may need very different<br>approaches for other communities<br>traumatized by political environmental<br>or economic upheavals through the arts<br>equal project in Finland I'm currently<br>working with Scandinavian researchers<br>addressing the refugee crisis in Europe<br>this dance research recognizes how<br>different we all are and seeks more<br>nuanced and responsive approaches to how<br>we use dance to address issues of social<br>inclusion my research involves<br>ethnographic studies through the talking<br>Dan's book series that I'm co-authoring<br>with associate professor Ralph bark and<br>dr. rosemary Martin I seek marginalized<br>voices this book series challenges<br>dominant national patriarchal and<br>colonial narratives that regarding the<br>role and function of dance in places<br>like the Middle East Asia the Pacific<br>and eastern europe my research also<br>involves created practice interventions<br>in the form of community-based<br>filmmaking my current research project<br>is a film entitled five cities five<br>senses it's created with community-based<br>organizations in Laos Palestine Italy<br>Australia and Fiji it seeks to<br>collectively reimagine urban landscapes<br>in these places this is an image from<br>that film so my research place is the<br>body the moving body the creative moving<br>body at the center of broader<br>socio-political issues so how does this<br>relate to you you did not all arrive<br>here today by attaching your brains to<br>some standard technological interface<br>you're very different bodies brought you<br>into this room and to get here today to<br>reach this room your body has been<br>central to thousands of decisions your<br>body has brought you information and<br>intuitions your body has improvised<br>ideas identified possibilities and<br>avoided problems through your bodies you<br>have experienced creation communication<br>reflection and inspiration when we<br>consider this it does not seem so<br>surprising that research into the<br>creatively moving body can be<br>interlinked with so many other<br>disciplines and research directions<br>thank</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
