Zealand Leadership Institute explains what underpins true "authentic" leadership.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I<br>think the call for authenticity is<br>related to three really important things<br>the first thing is that<br>it provides an answer so there's been a<br>lot of different modes of leadership<br>transformational leadership authentic<br>leadership and it says here it is<br>there's a way to do this secondly it has<br>been a response to bad leadership so<br>people know that there have been leaders<br>who have taken people right down the<br>wrong path and taken away their houses<br>and taken away their jobs and led them<br>to do things that are awful so authentic<br>leadership is a term that kind of<br>captures the idea of leaders that are<br>good and that a connector to what is<br>right and it's their true selves but the<br>third thing of late is that<br>authentic authenticity has had a had a<br>comeback and the comeback seems to be<br>connected to the rise of post-modernism<br>and the whole idea that we don't know<br>what's real anymore or that what's real<br>is on the move<br>so authenticity can seem like a way of<br>saying we can grab reality and we can<br>hold it firm and we can we can know what<br>it is what's interested a held in that<br>way is not the answer<br>its properties very problematic firstly<br>it implies that the leader is who he or<br>she is<br>separate from others so it creates the<br>idea of<br>individuals who are not in relationship<br>and<br>leadership is the last place where you<br>want to conjure up that notion so what<br>leaders need as the ability to be<br>connected and responsive in the moment<br>so it's really not that useful to have<br>an idea of a solid and enduring self<br>disconnected from whatever is going on<br>in the environment let alone and<br>environments that are uncertain and big<br>us and changing so if you think about<br>leadership and relationship and<br>relationship or an actual fact if you<br>pop relationship until authenticity you<br>get a different idea so I can be my only<br>true self and and I may have looked back<br>at my my past life and know what's<br>influencing me but what does that<br>actually mean in the moment in<br>particular circumstances and I'll give<br>you an example of somebody I was working<br>with yesterday who said I know why I am<br>so dominating in conversations it's<br>because I come from an Italian family<br>and we fight like men and we all leave<br>as friends and he said to his team and<br>that's the way it is isn't it well<br>actually no<br>because he's not in his Italian family<br>right now he's in a situation where half<br>the team are not contributing and God<br>knows he needs that they all need that<br>for the work that they have to do so her<br>sense of holy years is only partial and<br>needs to be connected to what are we<br>here to do and what is going on and my<br>relationship with others the idea of an<br>enduring self is appealing and we like<br>it and it's accessible and you know it<br>means we can truck off and have a look<br>at our life stories and then we know who<br>we are and it's so attainable the idea<br>that we are many different selves is a<br>harder idea for people to swallow<br>and it can sound superficial it can<br>sound as if in this situation I am<br>needing to be this that situation I'm<br>needing to be there and it and it can<br>get separated from authenticity I think<br>for folks so<br>where it's important what is helpful<br>with that is to think about what is<br>being called from me in this situation<br>so I am responding in a situation not<br>just because of who I am but of who you<br>and what you're eliciting from me and<br>followers illicit stuff from leaders<br>they illicit give us save us you know<br>give us give us the the clear firm<br>simple answers that we're craving<br>and so in actual fact<br>authenticity requires an awareness of<br>who you are being in the situation what<br>is being elicited in terms of yourself<br>and what other dimensions of yourself<br>you have to draw on that are going to<br>better meet the purpose of that<br>situation<br>because leadership is about is for<br>something it's not an end in itself so<br>the idea that you will call up other<br>dimensions of yourself because of<br>the needs of the situation there is<br>actually a really challenging idea it<br>requires a hell of a lot more of leaders<br>then<br>self-reflection and<br>reviewing the life story so authenticity<br>tends to stop there as I am Who I am and<br>I Know Who I am and I've done that work<br>but this requires<br>growing sort of new dimensions<br>leadership requires growing new<br>dimensions it requires the courage to<br>throw yourself and two dimensions of<br>yourself that you really haven't<br>developed so it's kind of like a muscle<br>you know you haven't used it and so it's<br>really easy just to stick with the ones<br>that you do use and so that is the work<br>the work is not reviewing your life<br>story it's going we entered realms that<br>you're not familiar with and having the<br>courage to do that and having the<br>courage to be different so one of my<br>favorite organizational services and<br>leadership we need to drop you need to<br>drop your tools so we're carrying these<br>tools and they're weigh us down<br>and some of the old tried-and-true tools<br>do my life story self-reflection yeah<br>pick them up from time to time<br>but an authenticity<br>the work is even more about putting<br>those tools down and going into new<br>territory<br>so if we think about the dynamic that<br>gets set up it actually it takes<br>some some sophistication and clarity of<br>purpose on behalf of a leader to cut<br>through the dynamics that build the<br>leader up to be someone to they can't<br>possibly be in terms of taking on the<br>needs and problems of others and to get<br>people involved in them and the work<br>that they are there to do an example of<br>that that I really like because when Tom<br>Peters came unto one of my colleagues<br>classrooms and it was a graduate class<br>and Peters was talking about leadership<br>with a small group a small group<br>probably or quite select students who<br>Anna graduate business program and the<br>conversation was<br>it was people were inspired and they<br>were July showed and here they were with<br>Tom Peters kind of like his colleagues<br>so they were worse a great man and<br>participating as equals and colleagues<br>was home and the vibe and the room was<br>was exciting for people and at some<br>point a student said jam Tom can you<br>tell us about one of the toughest points<br>in your career or lessons from your<br>career and probably was quite pleased<br>with himself with the question and<br>Thomas pondered was<br>hard tales that were personal about the<br>cost of<br>being in the limelight and blew the<br>bubble to some types of the bubble to<br>some degree of what was going on in that<br>room and I would argue that Tom had his<br>eye on what he was there to do he was<br>there to contribute to the learning and<br>to help them learn and and he actually<br>broke<br>an emerging idea of a leader as a<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
