This session should help you to decide which electives you would like to take in 2017.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>ladies and gentlemen as it's now 5 P I<br>think we need to make a start let me<br>Begin by welcoming you to this um<br>information session it's an annual event<br>where some of my colleagues will come<br>and tell you about some of the elective<br>courses that are being offered in 2017<br>so elective courses are available to<br>part three and part four students within<br>the<br>LLB the number of elective courses that<br>you take in the course of your LLB is<br>not specified it's a certain number of<br>points that you have to accumulate and<br>as you probably know elective courses<br>come in different sizes so we have the<br>small 10p point the medium 15 point and<br>the large 20 point<br>electives um you'll see from one of the<br>handouts that we<br>have academic staff coming to talk about<br>27 of the 50 elective courses that will<br>be offered next year so there will be<br>four offered in the summer school there<br>are currently 20 scheduled for the first<br>semester of next year and 26 for the<br>second<br>semester before um individual teachers<br>tell you about their particular courses<br>for next year either as a means of<br>encouraging your interest or possibly of<br>deterring you from enrollment um there<br>are a number of General points that need<br>to be made so if you'll just bear with<br>me for the next 14 minutes or so there<br>are the five things that are shown there<br>following the word introduction and<br>there are three other generic matters<br>for us to uh address as well just so<br>that you have a context in which to<br>consider each of the elective courses<br>that's been presented to you so the<br>first is the structure of the LLB<br>degree and students sometimes um because<br>they perhaps mathematically challenged<br>or because they confuse what is meant by<br>compulsory and what is meant by elective<br>find themselves at the end of part four<br>10 points short of their degree<br>requirements and then some Hasty<br>footwork is needed or approval of a late<br>supervised research paper or something<br>to get them out of their dilemma so that<br>their ability to do profs won't be<br>prejudiced their ability to graduate in<br>the next graduation ceremony won't be<br>prejudiced as well so in working out how<br>many electives you need I think what you<br>need to do is look at Parts three and<br>four of the degree<br>holistically within Parts three and four<br>you need to take land Equity jurist<br>Prudence law<br>399 legal ethics and law 4 99 or 498 and<br>I'll explain<br>498 so those are both Z Point courses<br>and then elective courses which allow<br>your total points for parts three and<br>four to add up to<br>240 so we're talking about 120 points<br>per part of the degree or two 40 points<br>for parts three and four combined if<br>Within part two you passed law 299 so if<br>Part Two For You consisted of 120 points<br>criminal public thoughts contract and<br>law 299 120 points then you need another<br>240 points to complete your degree if<br>you're one of those students who has<br>come into part two this year and is<br>undertaking law 298 which is worth 10<br>points added to crimes public TS and<br>contract that makes 130 points for part<br>two as a whole then the required total<br>for parts three and four is not 240 but<br>230 in other words if you've done 10<br>extra points in part two because you've<br>taken or 298 10 fewer points to take<br>later on in your degree 10 fewer points<br>in<br>electives so in doing the maths and<br>certainly the student advisers can<br>assist if you're in any doubt about<br>whether you're on track um you're<br>working towards a total of 2 40 points<br>across parts three and four compulsory<br>and elective courses combined unless<br>you've done 298 in which case the<br>requirement is 230 points in total law<br>499 is called Legal practice it has no<br>points associ at with it it is a device<br>it is a device by which the law faculty<br>makes sure that students in the course<br>of part three or four of their degree<br>have participated in a compulsory moot<br>in part three or one of the limited<br>alternative moots that are recognized<br>the Mari issues the Pacific issues and<br>the family law Motes so the general moot<br>the Mari the Pacific or the family and<br>have written a number of assignments<br>written assignments of at least 1500<br>words now it's hard to avoid those<br>assignments since we introduced<br>compulsory coursework into every<br>elective so almost inevitably amongst<br>your 11 or so elective courses that you<br>choose there will be at least five<br>pieces of writing that you will have<br>been doing of at least 1500 words and<br>thereby you satisfy the requirements of<br>law<br>499 law 498 is being introduced next<br>year for students who will be commencing<br>part three in 2017 or later and it<br>differs from law 499 in two respects<br>firstly there are there is a wider range<br>of moots to choose from so basically any<br>moot Beyond part two not just the<br>general faculty one the Mari the Pacific<br>and the family but any including the<br>competitive ones Beyond part two will<br>satisfy the muting requirement if you're<br>enrolled under law 498 the other<br>difference is that rather than requiring<br>five pieces of writing of a short<br>writing of 1500 words law 498 will<br>require one sustained piece of writing<br>of a minimum of 4,000 words in the<br>course of your degree in the course of<br>your<br>electives so for those that choose law<br>or students moving to part three next<br>year must do law 498 those of you who<br>are already in part three or four have<br>the option of either 499 or 498 neither<br>of them carries any points 498 will give<br>you a greater choice of Motes but it<br>does require a piece of sustained<br>writing of at least 4,000 words the<br>there are entries in your course<br>descriptions booklet on page 19<br>explaining law 498 and 499 and the<br>requirements for<br>both now there's one refinement and that<br>is when this was drafted and went off to<br>print two days ago it said what the<br>likely requirements would be for law 498<br>but they are now confirmed so it said I<br>think a uh a sustained piece of writing<br>of at least 4,000 words as a probable<br>requirement that's now confirmed it as<br>an actual requirement It also says that<br>that piece of writing of 4,000 words can<br>be satisfied in various ways and those<br>ways include completing a supervised<br>research paper a pilo and we'll talk<br>about those in a moment the report for<br>the Community Law Project or the<br>Community Law internship and we'll talk<br>about those research essay for a 15 or<br>30 point Master's course if you choose<br>to include a master's course within your<br>degree and in a minute we'll talk about<br>those possibilities<br>any other single piece of writing of the<br>required length honest seminar papers<br>and dissertations do not qualify cross<br>out the word not honor seminars papers<br>and dissertations do qualify for law 4<br>NAA they involve sustained writing Our<br>concern is to signal to prospective<br>employers that each law graduate of this<br>law school will have done at least one<br>piece of sustained writing of 4,000<br>words or more H the students will<br>inevitably have done that through their<br>honors requirements LLB students have a<br>variety of um options ways in which they<br>can satisfy that<br>requirement so leading on to the next<br>heading law 456 supervised research<br>there is an entry on page 63 in the<br>booklet about supervised research this<br>is a 15-point elective which is<br>essentially an opportunity for any law<br>student to investigate some area of law<br>in which they're interested and to write<br>a 10,000w research paper under the<br>supervision of one of my academic<br>colleagues it can be in any area of law<br>whatsoever so let's say you have a<br>particular interest and it's not<br>accomodated by any of the electives that<br>we're offering then this is your<br>opportunity to write about your area of<br>Interest 10,000 words and to be<br>supervised individually by a staff<br>member if you complete if you adopt that<br>option and complete your 10,000w<br>research paper then you've relieved<br>yourself of 15 points of electives that<br>you otherwise would have had to do<br>because the waiting for this elective is<br>15<br>points um you've satisfied that extended<br>writing requirement for law 498 because<br>you've written more than 4,000 words and<br>there is flexibility not only in terms<br>of the subject matter of your supervised<br>research but of the timing as well so a<br>supervised research paper can be<br>completed in summer or in the first<br>semester or in the second semester just<br>so long as there's somebody who's<br>available and willing to supervise it<br>for<br>you all right if you have a look at the<br>next page page 64 in your course<br>descriptions<br>booklet you'll see there firstly at the<br>top half of page 64 an entry about pilos<br>papers in lie of in Li of what in lie of<br>exam so in any elective course that you<br>are<br>taking as part of your LLB or LLB honor<br>degree whether it's a 10o a 15 point or<br>a 20 point if that elective course<br>involves a final examination at the end<br>of the semester you may apply in lie of<br>that examination to present a research<br>paper now the length of the research<br>paper which will obviously be on a topic<br>relevant to the course will vary<br>according to whether it's a 10p point a<br>15 point or a 20 point<br>elective so again if within a particular<br>elective course there's something that<br>you're passionate about or have a<br>burning interest in and would like to<br>pursue that and thereby avoid an exam at<br>the end of the semester as well then a<br>paper in L of exam with the approval of<br>the relevant teacher is a<br>possibility it's in respect of papers<br>and L and only in respect of those that<br>we insist on students attending classes<br>so if you're enrolled in any other<br>elective there's no obligation to attend<br>um lectures but where there is a<br>research paper in lie of the exam that<br>you are presenting then you're required<br>to attend so that you get reasonably<br>broad coverage of the course and just<br>don't focus on the one narrow aspect of<br>the course about which you're writing<br>your research paper so again a paper in<br>LW of exam will inevitably be a four<br>well will nearly always be a 4,000 or<br>more words and therefore it would<br>satisfy that extended or sustained<br>writing requirement also for law 498 for<br>498 Master's courses brief entry again<br>on page 64 and one of the handouts<br>identifies for you the Master's courses<br>that may be considered by part four<br>students for inclusion as electives<br>within their LLB degree so this year for<br>the first time we encouraged part four<br>students that is students who had passed<br>at least 120 points Beyond part two part<br>two and another 120<br>points and who had a be average in their<br>last two semesters or in their last 120<br>points to be permitted to do one or two<br>or even maybe even three Master's<br>courses as electives within the<br>LLB and that Arrangement continues and<br>to next year not for all Master's<br>courses but for those that are listed on<br>the<br>sheet so as it shows at the Top If the<br>prerequisites to be able to include any<br>of these in your LLB are that you've<br>passed at least 120 points Beyond part<br>two and that you have a GPA of five that<br>is a b average across your most recent<br>120 points of law<br>studies if so then you could consider<br>any of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine<br>Master's courses that are listed some of<br>which are weighted as 30 points some of<br>which are weighted as 15 points you may<br>include up to 45 points of Master's<br>courses within your LLB in which case<br>they count as LLB<br>electives some of the Master's courses<br>are taught intensively over 3 days or<br>maybe 5 days others are semester<br>long none of them is assessed by way of<br>exam so if exams are not your thing<br>Master's courses are an opportunity to<br>avoid exams they are assessed by way of<br>research papers for a 15-point master's<br>course a research paper of 6 and a half<br>thousand words for a 30-point master's<br>course a research paper of or research<br>essay of 12 a half thousand words either<br>of those of course satisfies the<br>sustained writing requirement for law<br>498 so if you are unimpressed by let's<br>say the 20 elective courses that are<br>being offered in the first semester next<br>year then you can consider that there<br>are in addition five Master's courses<br>being offered in the first semester next<br>year which can be taken if you're a part<br>for student as part of your LLB<br>degree and if so then you would get an<br>opportunity with the teacher of the<br>Master's course to negotiate your<br>particular topic within the Master's<br>course on which you'll be writing over 6<br>and a half th000 or 12 a half thousand<br>words depending on whether it's a 15 or<br>course if we look at page 51 in the<br>handbook uh the course descriptions<br>booklet<br>you will<br>see um on the second half of page 51 an<br>entry about law General 447 Community<br>Law Project and back on page 39 a<br>similar entry for Community Law<br>internship these are opportunities to<br>work with Community organizations for 75<br>hours in respect of the project for 150<br>hours in respect of the internship<br>to write either a 5,000-word reflective<br>report on that experience or a 10,000w<br>reflective report for the project or the<br>internship respectively and they are<br>electives worth 10 and 20 points<br>respectively so if there's a particular<br>Community organization that you would<br>like to work with youth Aid victim<br>support whatever it may be and you can<br>arrange or surren on your behalf can<br>arrange for you to spend 75 hours then<br>you can be credited with a 10-point<br>elective subject to writing the report<br>or 20 points under the Community Law<br>internship rubric subject to a 10,000w<br>report and those reports of course are<br>of sufficient length that they satisfy<br>the sustained writing requirement for<br>498 okay just two more generic comments<br>and then Peter you'll get your<br>opportunity um the first is that there<br>are some new courses being offered next<br>year that haven't been offered offered<br>previously or are returning after an<br>interval in a changed form so this year<br>there was no course in advocacy<br>previously there was an elective course<br>in advocacy it was limited to 40<br>students typically about 70 or 80<br>students wanted to take it next year<br>there will be two advocacy courses in<br>the first semester there will be trial<br>advocacy page 46 in your<br>booklet in the second semester appellate<br>advocacy it's page 52<br>each of them will be limited to 30<br>students in respect of trial advocacy to<br>40 students in respect of app pallet<br>advocacy so in total up to 70 students<br>could be accommodated across those two<br>courses and both courses are being<br>taught by teams from Meredith<br>Connell and each of those teams will be<br>coordinated by somebody who will be the<br>course director and responsible for the<br>coherency of the course and so<br>on the other new development is a human<br>rights Clinic this is clinical legal<br>education the first the law School's<br>First uh foray into this sort of um<br>elective course other than the community<br>projects and internships which we've<br>mentioned Andrew erti will teach or<br>coordinate this course and students will<br>work collectively on some human rights<br>project or projects page 63 in your<br>course descriptions booklet for<br>information about the human rights<br>Clinic though the information there is<br>very Spar it says I think just that this<br>is a new course and details will be<br>announc the last Point General point is<br>that as you may know the law school has<br>advertised a number of academic<br>vacancies and is hoping over the coming<br>weeks to make a number of academic<br>appointments so some colleagues have<br>departed for other pastures some will be<br>departing whether by way well More Often<br>by way of retirement than any other<br>cause in anticipation of those<br>departures or imminent departures there<br>are a number of academic positions to be<br>filled if they are filled in sufficient<br>time for the new appointees to be here<br>next year then there may be further<br>elective courses offered to supplement<br>the ones that we already know about so<br>regard the 20 showing for the first<br>semester next year as a minimum number<br>there may be others the 26 for the<br>second semester next year as a minimum<br>number there may be others and if there<br>are others we'll let you know about them<br>as soon as we know about them but there<br>will be no increase in the four that are<br>any questions on any of those General<br>yeah um no they're not and one of the<br>reasons that they're not is because<br>often in part for students go on<br>Exchange and we wanted all students to<br>have access to the advocacy courses<br>however they are restricted as to<br>numbers and so you might be interested<br>in the selection criteria so if there<br>were more than 30 students wanting to do<br>trial advocacy if there are more than 40<br>students wanting to do a pallet advocacy<br>then the selection criteria in each case<br>are each students's GPA across the law<br>courses that they've done to date and<br>their expressed interest and ability in<br>advocacy as shown by previous<br>competitions and those courses are not<br>restricted against each other so there's<br>nothing that says you want necessarily<br>be limited to one and have to make a<br>advocacy anything else yeah the human<br>rights Clinic course is that proposed to<br>be in semester one or semester two<br>semester two if I need to give Andrew<br>time to organize it um so it will be in<br>semester two it will have I think uh<br>some lectures at the beginning but then<br>students will be briefed as to how they<br>should act within the organizations that<br>they're working with and so on um the<br>details of the assessment is still being<br>worked out you'll see in fact throughout<br>the course descriptions booklet um that<br>it's silent on the assessment<br>arrangements for the elective causes now<br>that's not because we haven't thought<br>about them in most cases the assessment<br>Arrangements have been pinned down but<br>in a few instances there are still some<br>details to be settle before we can<br>publish those the only other General<br>thing to say of course is that for those<br>of you who are already secure in your<br>place in law school and not in the<br>competitive situation enrollments for<br>next year open on the first Monday of<br>November as they always do so that's<br>Monday the 7th of November member if<br>you're in part three or four now then<br>you can enroll in your elective courses<br>as from the 7th of next month if you are<br>currently in part two and moving to part<br>three next year you will not be able to<br>enroll in any part three courses until<br>we move you into the part three group<br>and that will occur only in December<br>when we've got all of the part two<br>results and can confirm that you have in<br>fact completed the part two requirements<br>and we will move all such students<br>together on block on MTH so that none<br>have a a Time advantage over for others<br>depending on when the last of the part<br>two grades come<br>in all right well if there's anything<br>else generic we can come back to it at<br>the end so now it's my pleasure to ask<br>Peter Professor Peter deire to address<br>elector okay so personal property is a<br>10-point paper there is uh 700 50w case<br>comment and then a final<br>exam uh why would you want to take the<br>course because when you take landlord<br>you've taken one half of property the<br>other half is personal property let me<br>tell you very briefly what we'll cover<br>uh we'll cover the boundary between real<br>and personal property when has a chatt<br>become land and it played out in some<br>important commercial litigation you<br>might be forgiven for thinking why isn't<br>it covered in the commercial lease or<br>commercial conveyance the answer is<br>people forget it so boundary between<br>real and personal property we follow<br>that on uh with the consequences of<br>possession much of the course is<br>concerned with tangible personalty in<br>other words this is tangible personalty<br>anything capable of being physically<br>held uh so we look at possession we move<br>to the finders cases you will find a lot<br>of the topics resonate with your daily<br>life for example you taking you're in a<br>field somebody else's field having a<br>picnic you see a shiny object it's a<br>gold fountain pen and you think I'd like<br>that the owner isn't in the picture so<br>you're the finder however the farmer<br>looks Over the Hedge and says give it to<br>me the question is do you and what will<br>be the consequences if you<br>don't okay that's sort of very practical<br>orientation we have a couple of class is<br>on the personal property Securities act<br>which is a major piece of<br>legislation the remainder of the course<br>will be on bailment bailment is an<br>everyday event where all bailees in<br>other words bailment arises when one<br>person is in possession of the goods of<br>another so if I give you this you become<br>my baile huge and significant<br>consequences flow from that it could be<br>a personal relationship it could be a<br>complex commercial one the principles<br>will be largely the same uh the feedback<br>that I've got from the course is that<br>people find it incredibly useful<br>incredibly valuable just in their daily<br>lives as lay people as well as lawyers<br>arising and if none but we move on to<br>row and<br>half thank you Peter so the entering for<br>personal property was on page 32 and for<br>35 good afternoon everyone U my name is<br>Rowan um next year and semester 2 uh I'm<br>taking a course which is entitled<br>aspects of insurance law uh this is a<br>10-point uh paper two hours a week of<br>lectures um the assessment will be by<br>way of um final exam and a uh compulsory<br>um<br>opinion uh the course will cover um the<br>essential aspects of insurance law um<br>I've listed them in the uh course<br>handbook uh we'll start by looking at uh<br>the history of<br>insurance uh and insurance law uh then<br>move on to the duty of utmost good faith<br>Duty which uh an insured has at the time<br>they uh take out insurance to disclose<br>uh material facts uh to the insurer and<br>not make a<br>misrepresentation uh we them mo move on<br>to how an insurance policy is<br>interpreted uh the scope of cover uh the<br>content and effect of warranties and<br>conditions uh the claims process and<br>fraudulent claims and finally uh how the<br>insurer's obligations are<br>Quantified so why might you consider<br>taking this paper well um I'll give you<br>four<br>reasons first is uh that insurance is uh<br>highly important uh in uh legal practice<br>uh particularly if you're thinking about<br>uh practicing litigation uh often<br>insurers will be uh found behind uh<br>commercial parties and therefore<br>understanding of insurance law uh is is<br>of real Advantage uh in the context of<br>litigation uh secondly uh learning<br>insurance law will reinforce uh<br>Knowledge and Skills uh from the<br>foundational subjects such as contract<br>law uh because insurance law is<br>essentially a uh a mix of contract law<br>and uh more specific principles and<br>legislation uh deal dealing specifically<br>with<br>insurance uh thirdly uh the course will<br>have a very practical um focus um I'll<br>spend some lectures uh going over uh<br>typical insurance law problems including<br>past examination problems uh<br>so it won't simply be uh ordinary<br>lectures there'll be a mix of lectures<br>and more practical<br>workshops and the final reason is is a<br>monetary one there is a prize of $1,000<br>if you come first so um for those<br>reasons I'd encourage you to consider<br>taking insurance law and I um look<br>forward to seeing some of you there<br>thank<br>you thank you la and it is the next page<br>30 in your course descriptions<br>booklet judge<br>thank you<br>Steven good afternoon everybody uh law<br>and it law<br>426 is a 15o uh paper there is an exam<br>it's an open book exam uh and it's all<br>about tech um if you code that's an<br>advantage uh when you think of the law<br>most of it's if then statements anyway<br>so uh it's kind of fun uh we look at all<br>sorts of things uh some new stuff that<br>we'll be looking at next year will be uh<br>implications of blockchain on Smart<br>Contracting and whether or not you're<br>going to need to know how to code and<br>what code means when it comes to<br>contractual interpretation because it's<br>a new world uh we will be looking at<br>legal expert systems and how to do<br>yourself out of a job by divining<br>designing software applications that at<br>least will simplify many of the<br>processes what we are presently in and<br>as we stand here we are in what I call<br>Kinetic space uh we touch we talk we're<br>present physically present with one<br>another uh information Technologies<br>allow for kinetic space to dissolve so<br>instead of a courtroom being a place in<br>fact Court becomes a service uh that is<br>offered the way in which Legal Services<br>can be provided the way in which the law<br>and legal advice can be provided can be<br>commod commoditized as a result of<br>Information Technology systems<br>underneath all of this of course is the<br>internet and there are issues that we'll<br>be looking at like governance systems uh<br>who runs the domain name space how why<br>and whether or not it shouldn't be<br>changed uh how to engage in criminal<br>Behavior online and how not to get away<br>with it because we'll be looking at<br>computer searches and surveillance and<br>all of that type of stuff we cover<br>pretty much the the entire law course in<br>a sort of overall way seeing how<br>information Technologies impact upon it<br>um I see that there are some of my<br>former students from this year here uh<br>they'll tell you if I'm misrepresenting<br>it uh I find it a lot of fun to teach<br>and I hope that my students find it a<br>questions I'll see you all there thank<br>you<br>so next Dr Caroline Foster international<br>law that's page 54 and advanced<br>international law page 62 hello<br>everybody I'm Caroline Foster um I'm a<br>South Islander I have two primary school<br>age children so I've had a very busy 10<br>years um what I think I might do is tell<br>you about both of the courses and then<br>see if you have any questions about<br>either course so let's start with<br>international<br>law uh okay so we're on page 54 of the<br>booklet is uh is Steven S um it's a 20o<br>course so it's 4 hours a week normally<br>split into two days and we cover the<br>basics of the whole system of public<br>international law so we look at things<br>like what other sources of international<br>law for example treaties which we look<br>at in some depth and how you interpret<br>them we also look for instance at the<br>work of international courts and<br>tribunals and then in the last few weeks<br>of the course we do quite a lot of<br>intensive work on use of force where we<br>look at the use of force uh by other<br>states in Iraq and in Afghanistan uh but<br>also most recently of course in Syria<br>including against Isis and also uh in<br>the um Crimean peninsula in the Ukraine<br>which as you might know was taken over<br>by Russia not so long ago uh and then we<br>generally make a few observations about<br>how those rules on use of force might<br>apply uh in the Cyber domain um which<br>poses some some really interesting<br>questions uh the teaching methods are uh<br>I give you readings and I give you<br>questions on those which I usually email<br>out after class each time um we also<br>spend some time in class planning out<br>exam answers so sketching out how you<br>would um you know plan your answer to an<br>exam question and in the last three<br>2hour classes of the course we do<br>workshops uh on those um countries where<br>we've been looking at the rules on use<br>of<br>force the assessment as you will see is<br>75% by the exams that it's a 2-hour exam<br>uh and 25% by a test partway through<br>which is a 1H hour<br>test so that's public international law<br>the basic rules and some use of force<br>now in aspects of advanced international<br>law uh we deal with more selective<br>topics that actually really rather<br>contrast with what we cover in basic<br>public international law so I'm now on<br>page 62 of the booklets uh as you will<br>see it's a 10 course so it is only uh<br>one 2hour block a week and it is offered<br>in the second semester whereas uh the<br>public international law courses in the<br>first semester but you do have to have<br>done the public international law course<br>to do the advanced international law<br>course uh I thought it might be useful<br>just to mention um that um because it<br>can they probably un exchange students<br>here actually so I'll leave that out but<br>you'll see it in the in the um in the<br>program let me tell you a bit more about<br>the course okay so content um the<br>purpose of this course is essentially to<br>look at practical problems that cross<br>different subfields of international law<br>so use of force is one subfield of<br>international nor but if you think about<br>it there are lots of other sub Fields so<br>there's trade there's<br>environment there's human rights there's<br>investment protection and the list go go<br>on and ideally we want you to develop<br>some skills at dealing with a practical<br>problem might cut across quite a few of<br>those different areas so first of all we<br>develop some some familiarity with those<br>different areas and then we'll take a<br>problem uh and we'll look at how you<br>actually might apply those different<br>areas together so you can see why you<br>need your basic international skills to<br>start with you need to know what a<br>treaty is and how you it and so forth to<br>give you an example of some of the sorts<br>of crosscutting issues that we've looked<br>at before<br>we have looked at um subsidies in the<br>Fisheries industry and how that can<br>incentivize over fishing leading to<br>depletion of the fish stocks in the<br>world's oceans so that deals with issues<br>that relate to trade because it's<br>subsidies and also environment and also<br>LW of the sea and in some cases human<br>rights because many countries actually<br>depend on fish protein for<br>food another example is the uh debate<br>that is Raging over what you can put on<br>the packets to sell cigarettes whether<br>you can eliminate a lot of The Branding<br>and instead require these horrible<br>disgusting images to put people off<br>smoking trade investment uh intellectual<br>property um human rights and health<br>issues couple of examples maybe<br>corporate social responsibility is is<br>another example um so you've got a<br>description of it in your brochure um<br>the assessment will be a mixture of<br>class participation and examination<br>heavily waited in favor of the<br>examination but I should tell you that<br>we will be doing a work shops also uh on<br>each of the general subject areas before<br>the exam so um you have a good level of<br>comfort going into it um it is a<br>challenging course and it does require<br>um concerted effort and input every<br>class where I call on different students<br>to contribute and I think people have<br>welcomed that and have feedback that<br>they they get quite a lot out of it do I<br>have time to take a question no no sorry<br>hope to see you next we thank you<br>Caroline um the timeable details for all<br>these courses are at the front of the<br>bookl at pages 4 to7 the next course is<br>guarantees and indemnities the<br>information for that is on page 32<br>Michael<br>Sten hi um I thought i' first talk about<br>the mechanics of the court and then why<br>you want to do it um it's a summer<br>school offering and it's um done over 8<br>three-hour lectures um three hour<br>lectures are half but that's the you<br>have a limited choice in summer school<br>we take a break every hour now um on the<br>plus side this year it doesn't start<br>till the 24th I'm just through cramming<br>the lectures in so you get a little bit<br>more um<br>holiday now the assessment will be<br>there'll be a multi-choice exam and the<br>rest of it will be a closed book um exam<br>at the end of it it'll be 2 hours um now<br>as far as the course goes it's um has<br>anyone done it before here out of<br>interest it's been a couple of years<br>since I've taught it but it's a subset<br>of contract um a guarantee it's just a<br>secondary obligation uh if you need to<br>get an overdraft or something like that<br>uh the bank will be more than happy to<br>give it to you but they'll want a<br>guarantee from your parents so uh that's<br>the context that it um arises at um now<br>why should you do it it's an essential<br>commercial subject um if you're<br>practicing as a lawyer um having a<br>knowledge of the formal requirements<br>around the guarantee it's like a<br>contract for the sale of land you need<br>to do it um if you end up in court and<br>don't know it judges expect you to okay<br>um it's as it's a subset of contract<br>we'll go through um contractual<br>requirements again it's a um Fair part<br>of the course so it's a good refresher<br>for that as well um and personally<br>speaking I was an undergrad until 1991<br>so I found it useful having to go back<br>and um uh refresh myself on what the<br>requirements of a contract are um I tend<br>to be very practical on the way I teach<br>I work as a barrister this is the only<br>subject I teach so um it's for me I mean<br>laws about clients you know I have to<br>justify myself to clients every day um<br>occasionally after to go up to the<br>courts uh judges see my written work and<br>I have to justify myself to them as well<br>and advocate for my clients so um for me<br>it starts with them um they're the<br>punters and they're paying my paying my<br>bills uh and the other um the the people<br>uh to who law is important I think it's<br>important not to lose sight of that um<br>I'm passionate about what I teach um I<br>really enjoy it I had a year off last<br>year so RAR to go in it um<br>now what I do during the class is and<br>I'll do it more and more is have problem<br>questions okay so it's um I found that<br>it works uh it just breaks up the<br>monotony frankly um and it just means<br>that you go back and it helps you<br>reinforce your learning um what I'll be<br>doing next time is probably<br>uh less of an emphasis on the case LA<br>and more problem questions okay so I<br>just want to make sure that we go go<br>through it at a fairly slow pace um<br>everyone is uh takes in what's being<br>taught and you understand it um and if<br>you do that you should do very well on<br>the exam um what I'll also do is give<br>you uh tips on writing and things like<br>that through the course um as I said<br>there is an internal assessment<br>component but the main part of it will<br>be your exam and to write a good exam P<br>you've got to write well um it's a skill<br>that you learn through law school but<br>when you get to doing what I do it's um<br>just Cardinal okay it's a Cornerstone of<br>what you have to do so um I'll be<br>talking about courses I've done and just<br>the skills I've acquired over time where<br>you have to set out your argument<br>clearly okay um and uh it's being able<br>to do that it's just an essential that<br>you'll need to develop now and have<br>throughout your career or for you to be<br>um effective so as I said um didn't do<br>it last year but really enjoy uh looking<br>forward to getting into it next year and<br>questions thanks<br>guys so next Dr J Norton uh to talk<br>about two courses rights and freedoms<br>that's page 56 in your booklet and<br>administrative law which Janel co- teing<br>all right so slight change is that<br>jennif Clan is going to talk about<br>administrative law if that's right um<br>Janet and I are going to talk teach<br>administrative law together which will<br>be really fun we plan to make it really<br>fun um and we're not just going to be<br>looking at judicial review we're going<br>to be looking at administrative<br>decision- making so how administrative<br>bodies make decisions but the main<br>course that uh I'm teaching so co- teing<br>admin with gent mlan the main uh<br>elective that I'm teaching just by<br>myself is rights and freedoms next year<br>so I probably know many of you from<br>Equity uh but I also have an interest in<br>in uh Theory and also uh the theory of<br>Human Rights so rights and freedom is of<br>course that I inherited from Paul<br>rishworth and have made some changes to<br>it uh we start by looking at the theory<br>of Human Rights so what is a right uh so<br>I build on some of the knowledge that<br>you'll have from jurist prudence and<br>then we look at what is a human right so<br>what do we mean when we talk about human<br>rights and how they can be justified so<br>one of the questions I get the students<br>to think about is does it can we really<br>have human rights if we don't uh believe<br>in God so where do these these rights<br>come from and then we move on to look at<br>the limitations that are placed on human<br>rights and then we start to look at some<br>some case studies from the United States<br>from New Zealand from South Africa from<br>India from the UK uh and from the<br>European Court of Human Rights and we<br>look at uh case studies on torture uh<br>religious freedom freedom of expression<br>and we also look we end the course by<br>looking at socioeconomic rights now uh<br>to take this course I uh have a<br>particular uh vision for this course and<br>that is that all my students are to uh<br>be independent Learners and to think<br>critically so I'm I'm very uh I very<br>much try to dissuade the students from<br>just sitting there passively and uh then<br>getting to the exam and just writing<br>done everything that I say in fact you<br>won't do well in that course what I want<br>you to do and I'm I'm pretty generous<br>when it comes to the exam and assessment<br>I really want you to explore the areas<br>that you find interesting and um base<br>your assessment around that um and<br>that's you need to read a lot and you<br>need to think a lot and uh if you don't<br>like doing that then please don't take<br>rights and freedoms because I'll end up<br>dealing with lots of complaints from you<br>or you'll end up pulling out the first<br>two weeks so if you enjoy reading and<br>you enjoy think thinking critically and<br>if if you enjoy not just regurgitating<br>what the person in front of you says uh<br>then you'll love my course um the<br>assessment is 80% exam and then 20% a<br>discussion paper and in the discussion<br>paper you're expected to redo the<br>reading and then critically respond to<br>the reading so again if you find that<br>difficult or you don't enjoy that then<br>this won't be a course that you'll enjoy<br>but otherwise I think most of the<br>students who took it this year had a had<br>a good time um so that's me thank<br>you so next Cory will talk about<br>evidence and negotiation which you're<br>not actually teaching no but that's fine<br>respectively hi everyone some of you I<br>know some of you I don't uh my name is<br>Nina kuri I uh teach the dispute<br>resolution courses here at the law<br>school undergrad and postgraduate and<br>evidence I have a background in civil<br>litigation practice these days I am<br>teaching here at the law school and<br>continue my private practice as a media<br>so um I'm going to talk to you very<br>briefly about the evidence course uh<br>which I teach in the first semester and<br>my colleague Scott optican teachers in<br>the second semester and I'm also going<br>to talk to you about the negotiation<br>mediation and dispute resolution course<br>which I have taught for the last couple<br>of years but next year uh will be taught<br>by um a New Zealander colleague of mine<br>who's recently returned from Singapore<br>Ian McDuff so there is a limit to what I<br>can tell you about that second course<br>because I don't know what changes he<br>will make but I can tell you the broad<br>outline so I propose to tell you in the<br>3 minutes I have allocated for each<br>course what the subject is why you might<br>like to do it uh how the classes run and<br>what the assessment is so let's start<br>with<br>evidence uh evidence is the rules<br>governing the admission of evidence into<br>court proceedings so uh both in criminal<br>proceedings and in civil proceedings<br>that is largely governed now happily by<br>one statute The Evidence Act 2006 and<br>what we do in the course is take the<br>seven broad fundamental building block<br>topics and learn how the ACT Works in<br>practice for those topics so you'll see<br>them listed in the handout and the<br>handbook uh I don't need to go through<br>them but if you think that you might<br>ever go anywhere near a courtroom then<br>you should treat this course as<br>compulsory okay it's that's pretty much<br>uh where it's at when it comes to<br>evidence so they tend to be big classes<br>uh and they're treated by the law school<br>as quasi compulsory courses because they<br>really are foundational subjects it's a<br>foundational subject in a law degree uh<br>how uh I run the course well with a<br>course like this it would be really easy<br>to just in a really boring way go<br>through the Evidence Act and tell you<br>this is the section this is how it<br>applies and so on so both Scott and I<br>try to move away from that and so yes<br>you need to know those rules you then<br>need to know how to apply them okay and<br>it's a little bit like riding a bike you<br>can learn all the theory but you don't<br>know how to do it until you actually do<br>it so what we both tend to do is talk<br>about um what the law is uh talk about<br>how it's applied in practice with cases<br>and then actually get stuck in and do<br>problems and we do those through past<br>exam questions um done almost tutorial<br>style in class uh the we also talk about<br>some of the deeper policy questions and<br>with evidence it kind of goes as deep as<br>you want to go really right down to what<br>the justice system is about and what the<br>Rules of Evidence say about that uh and<br>even if you want to go further it's how<br>do we know what we think we know and<br>then you can get distracted by all sorts<br>of conversations about the stake in the<br>Matrix and all those sorts of things<br>right so uh the other purpose of the<br>evidence course is really uh practicing<br>your logical reasoning skills and really<br>that's what evidential reasoning is<br>about so our goal in teaching is to get<br>those cogs in your brain well oiled uh<br>and uh well practiced because this stuff<br>moves fast in court and you need to know<br>the answer<br>quickly that's evidence any questions<br>about<br>that okay uh the negotiation mediation<br>and dispute resolution course uh in all<br>common law jurisdictions with which we<br>compare ourselves somewhere between 90<br>90 and 98% of civil proceedings filed<br>never go to trial so the vast majority<br>of your practice if you're going to go<br>into any form of civil litigation or<br>family law or employment law is going to<br>be about all that stuff that happens out<br>of court if you're going into<br>transactional work you need to be able<br>to negotiate and if you're not planning<br>on practicing law at all chances are<br>you're going to do something else that<br>requires you to think critically and<br>negotiate and that's what this course is<br>all about preparing you to do so we look<br>at theory and practice of negotiation<br>mediation and other forms of dispute<br>resolution uh and the assessment in uh<br>past years has been a mix of theory and<br>practice with some research components a<br>group presentation component and some<br>reflective work uh about negotiation uh<br>skills I don't know what will be uh the<br>case next year so you need to just um<br>keep an eye out for that in terms of<br>evidence assessment I realized I didn't<br>cover that uh Scott and I do it<br>differently Scott has a 3-hour final<br>exam exam and a compulsory opinion I<br>have this year for the first time<br>changed it and I expect I will continue<br>that next year to have instead of a<br>3-hour final exam there will be a 1H<br>hour midterm test that covers roughly<br>the material up to that point a 2hour<br>final exam which covers the remainder of<br>the<br>material okay so that you don't have to<br>double up and then a 10% case brief uh<br>where you have three options spread with<br>different deadlines throughout the<br>semester and that should be<br>self-explanatory about why I think<br>that's a good<br>model<br>okay yeah are all of your open yes yep<br>absolutely open book it's really I'm not<br>interested in whether you can memorize<br>this stuff I want to know what you can<br>do with<br>it good<br>question yeah K the winess<br>examination of that course I'm sorry um<br>there's a witness examination no no okay<br>same obviously overlaps in terms of<br>content but not part of the course at<br>all uh and both of us uh try and make it<br>interesting and we expect participation<br>from the class it makes it much more fun<br>for everyone and we'll throw out some<br>controversial stuff it's just how both<br>of us teach but you can ask people about<br>that okay any other questions great<br>thank you thank you timely arrival by<br>Paul Suter so po course is uh<br>intellectual property the details of<br>which uh in your book at page<br>25 um and I'm sorry I'm rushing a bit<br>because we going teach it now at 3:00 so<br>basically by the mic if you would what's<br>being recorded being recorded being<br>recorded okay um intellectual property<br>like love is all around us<br>so it's it's relevant and it's<br>interesting it's highly significant in<br>commercial life but it's also touches on<br>other areas like the Arts and Music and<br>literature and so on the course actually<br>covers then copyright law trademark law<br>including the tort of passing off<br>protection of confidential information<br>including private<br>secrets and it does cover also patents<br>and registered<br>designs yes regrettably there is an exam<br>3 hour exam it's 90% 10% elective<br>essay<br>and I welcome questions as a practicing<br>lawyer I try and make it as realistic as<br>possible there are some interesting<br>academic little highways and byways but<br>I try and tie it to what you might<br>encounter as practicing<br>questions super I look forward to<br>possibly seeing you next year cheers<br>thank<br>you Professor Craig ell will talk about<br>international text the details of which<br>are on page<br>34 great so<br>um such a streamlined organization<br>stepen it's<br>fantastic uh thank you will<br>International tax um International tax<br>is one of three tax papers that you can<br>do uh that makes Oakland University by<br>country mile uh the best place if you're<br>interested in specializing in tax uh<br>because there really isn't any uh other<br>uh institution up and down the country<br>that has anywhere near that uh level of<br>uh of um uh focus on this topic it's a<br>great career tax by the way not only is<br>it very remunerative um it's also<br>intellectually very demanding uh and uh<br>International tax is of course uh<br>relevant it's been in the headlines like<br>a heck a lot in the last period of time<br>if you think back on multinationals<br>avoiding tax and uh what the<br>government's response has been to that<br>and the oecd uh if you think about the<br>Panama papers and the naming of New<br>Zealand and its foreign trust regime<br>that's another area uh so<br>um what we what we do in the course is<br>it's a 15o uh course we've got a 3-hour<br>exam uh so a bit like like like Paul's<br>one we focus very much on uh practical<br>issues uh just a few years back I was a<br>tax partner at chapion trip um so we<br>tend to use examples that are based in<br>uh in relevant real world situations for<br>instance uh last year's opinion was on a<br>crossb shipping uh lease and the<br>implications under the Singapore New<br>Zealand uh and the um uh there was<br>another country as well too which I<br>can't remember what it is quite now but<br>anyway we we we were looking at those<br>implications and how the double tax<br>treaty<br>works so uh to whom would this appeal um<br>I think anyone who wants to specialize<br>in tax would find this very useful um uh<br>basically you don't get tax practice<br>without International transactions<br>nowadays even small and middle siize<br>organizations have transactions that are<br>occurring in Australia just simply the<br>days of um turning to an expert uh and<br>thinking that they had to use a double<br>Tech treat just doesn't exist it is it's<br>there for everyone uh but if you're not<br>if you're more a generalist and don't<br>actually want to specialize in tax I<br>still think it would be um amazingly uh<br>useful uh in fact not this year but the<br>preceding year uh when uh some students<br>did it without having done the basic tax<br>course uh they actually passed extremely<br>well um and one of the reasons for that<br>is because uh being an international law<br>topic it involves the interpretation of<br>tax treaties it's a it's effectively the<br>role of soft La the oecd commentary and<br>how you interpret it's actually a course<br>about<br>interpretation um so don't be put off uh<br>there are if you're scared of numbers<br>this is a number Friendly course um uh<br>it it doesn't you don't need numbers to<br>understand uh tax um and uh this is much<br>more about uh the law and the oecd<br>interpretation so please don't be<br>worried if you haven't done tax before<br>uh you don't need that prior experience<br>uh you can simply do it independently of<br>that and what it's what value would it<br>have to you then um I think it would be<br>a very good example of an international<br>subject that you can use um and you can<br>use in commercial uh negotiations uh it<br>will also give you a window on the tax<br>world uh in a different way without<br>necessarily if you don't if you don't<br>want to be sort of full on uh into uh<br>into into tax practice I'm not quite<br>sure how much time I've got stepen but<br>we're just about out of time we are just<br>about out of time CH okay well maybe<br>maybe that would be uh that would be a<br>better way to deal with it so please<br>don't be worried if you if you if you<br>scared about the idea that you need to<br>do the other tax papers you don't you<br>can do it uh alternatively if you're mad<br>keen on tax like I would have been at<br>your age uh you you you do all three<br>that's that that would be my<br>recommendation but Michael tell you<br>about other two when that when those<br>all I bet you're feeling bombarded with<br>information um but anyway it's<br>uh I I'll look forward to seeing some of<br>you hopefully uh in the first semester<br>thank you very much thank you all right<br>ladies and gentlemen we'll now resume<br>and we resume with<br>professor professor David Williams who<br>talk about two courses legal history and<br>contemporary<br>preat okay Koto um so I'm they said<br>David Williams one of them anyway<br>there's a few David Willam in the world<br>I'm not David A R Williams QC um but I<br>am David Williams and I'm teaching two<br>courses uh next year in the second<br>semester um and most of the courses<br>you'll study are all legal history<br>courses Because by the time you finish<br>your degree and go and put your degree<br>into practice there will be a new court<br>president that will have come out there<br>will be a new Act of parliament will<br>have come out and what you'll be put<br>into place uh is is the law in place at<br>the time uh but uh uh it'll be what you<br>learn at University will have an element<br>of history but if you want some real<br>history you want to go back in time and<br>find out what it's like to hang draw and<br>quarter people on their way to their<br>deaths um then this is the course for<br>you witchcraft is uh something that<br>captivates people um and um and usually<br>they don't have a very good ending um<br>and why was that and what people think<br>they were doing when they were doing<br>witchcraft why did they execute King<br>Charles I first what had he done wrong<br>um he thought he could rule the country<br>and other people said no you should have<br>us to help you along the way that's a<br>public law oriented course you've got<br>the choice next year I see that um my<br>colleague um Warren Swain is teaching uh<br>aspects of legal history he's a he's<br>very much a private law man uh teaching<br>contrac law history in particular I'm<br>much more a public law man teaching uh<br>uh some of the ways in which we've got<br>the type of order we've got today uh but<br>where does it all come from one of the<br>other themes of of of the course that I<br>teach is legal pluralism a lot of people<br>say you know we should have one law for<br>all um all new zealanders should be<br>under one law well the English common<br>law was not made up of one law it came<br>from the law Merchant it came from canon<br>law it came from Roman law it came from<br>um uh folk law of the Anglo-Saxon<br>kingdoms uh it came from Norman feudal<br>impositions it came from a whole variety<br>of sources and got melded into a great<br>mixture uh of stuff that we now teach in<br>in uh in New Zealand as part of the New<br>Zealand common law uh and it's quite<br>interesting to just look at some of<br>those those things in the background um<br>and if you say why do why do we really<br>want to know about moral panics about<br>witchcraft or in the in the 17th century<br>or or whatever else it is the person you<br>should really take notice of is not<br>Scott opan it's um it's uh uh a man<br>called Mark Twain at least that was his<br>um writing name Samuel Clemens was his<br>real name and he said um history may not<br>repeat itself but it does Rhyme a lot so<br>yeah anything that's happened in the<br>world of previous legal history uh is<br>bound to happen again in one way or<br>another if you're interested in moral<br>panics and Witchcraft you might be<br>interested in international terrorism<br>law in the 21st century the second<br>course that I'm speaking for course<br>director is um Andrew edti uh and he and<br>I will be teaching the Contemporary<br>treaty issues of course this is indeed<br>contemporary uh this is treaty issues as<br>of now and Al on uh and uh uh Andrew's<br>uh Focus will be primarily on uh uh<br>comparative jurist Prudence of treaties<br>between indigenous peoples and Colonial<br>Powers um uh he's he he's done<br>quite a lot of work on uh all the<br>various International conventions that<br>are Rel relevant to indigenous people's<br>rights as especially of course the<br>United Nations Declaration on the rights<br>of indigenous peoples um my part of the<br>um of the mixture is primarily the<br>treaty settlement process um some of the<br>people who have been teaching this<br>course this year I've been teaching it<br>this year and they've gone along to<br>Kylie quincon says who's that old white<br>fell who's who seems to know a whole lot<br>of stuff about this treaty stuff say<br>well I'm the the old white fell uh and<br>I've been involved in treaty stuff since<br>the basting Point occupation at uh at U<br>orar in<br>1977 um I've got a few convictions to my<br>name of a criminal sort um uh and I've<br>got a few convictions uh of a legal and<br>Scholastic sort uh and if you come to<br>one of those two classes you'll get uh<br>some idea of what they might be and you<br>make up your own mind as to what you<br>think about them so Koto thank you<br>yes please so course criminal procedures<br>Scot up page 58 in your<br>book uh I don't have any criminal<br>convictions but I but I'm still young<br>and I'm still hoping so there's still<br>time uh my name is Scott optican<br>associate professor I also teach<br>evidence but Nina Corey talked to you<br>about evidence uh so she teaches one<br>semester I teach that and the other but<br>you've already heard about that so uh<br>nothing to say there but I am the other<br>teacher of evidence criminal procedure<br>um<br>it's a three-hour week course 2hour Week<br>final exam all courses and materials<br>done by me Criminal procedure with a<br>writing assignment that's worth X<br>percentage for the class criminal<br>procedure is the study of two things um<br>criminal investigation and then criminal<br>trial process uh on the criminal<br>investigation side we study police<br>Powers search and seizure uh police<br>questioning practices um and various<br>other aspects related uh to policing uh<br>on the criminal adjudication side the<br>trial side we study Fair trial rights<br>the right to a jury trial right to<br>adequate time and Facilities to prepare<br>defense right to be present right to<br>cross- examing Witnesses Etc so the<br>course is divided up a little bit<br>between criminal investigation which is<br>the main focus and criminal adjudication<br>it covers topics such as search or<br>seizure police questioning the right to<br>silence the right to counsel um land<br>transport act stops uh and uh various<br>criminal uh procedural rights at trial<br>such as as I said the right to examine<br>Witnesses Fair trial rights um media<br>bias uh jury selection and things like<br>that um it's a good course definitely I<br>would say kind of must take course for<br>anybody who wants to get into the<br>criminal law business either as a<br>prosecutor defense lawyer uh or maybe<br>someone who wants to deal with criminal<br>law and policy I myself I'm a former<br>prosecutor and studied criminology and<br>various criminal justice issues that's<br>how I got interested in it um if you're<br>not actually interested in getting into<br>the business either a prosecutor defense<br>Lewy or someone connected with criminal<br>justice but you're just interested in a<br>course on basic concepts of police<br>Powers criminal trial process and<br>criminal investigation the rules that<br>govern that um it will be an interesting<br>course for you so it's for one or both<br>of those kinds of people um someone<br>who's going to be actually in the<br>business and wants to learn the law of<br>uh police Powers criminal investigation<br>criminal adjudication and then someone<br>who just wants to take one course in<br>that area um out out of Interest and<br>that's uh basically it so any more<br>questions you know where to find me<br>other than that I thought I said that<br>already it's a it's a two-hour final<br>2our final exam plus a written<br>assignment worth I think uh 20% 1500w<br>written assignment all course materials<br>done by me relevant statutes of<br>assertion surveillance act criminal<br>procedure act J's act and of course<br>sections 21 to 25 of the New Zealand<br>Bill of<br>Rights any<br>questions all right thank you thank<br>you so Dr go next um commercial law<br>book everyone so I'm I'm here and I<br>teach the commercial law course so the<br>other day I bought a pair of set of<br>chairs at Freedom you might think okay<br>nice good for you um but so here's a<br>question when did I become the owner<br>when I signed the<br>contract when I pushed okay and signed<br>on the<br>um on uh the Visa<br>card<br>or when they're labeled the boxes with<br>my name or when they actually delivered<br>these chairs to my house when did I<br>become the owner so that's a question<br>that we'll discuss in the commercial law<br>course and we'll look at the sale of<br>goods act we'll look at when property<br>actually transfers now what if in a few<br>weeks from now hopefully not but what if<br>there's a problem with these chairs<br>and there's nothing in the contract does<br>that mean I have no rights at all um can<br>I make a complaint and say hey these<br>were really rubbish shares that you sold<br>me do have any rights under the relevant<br>legislation so that's another thing that<br>we'll look at under sell of goods act<br>and as well under the consumer<br>guarantees act which has significantly<br>changed the sale of goods act um<br>compared at least for consumer goods and<br>then we'll look at the fif trading act<br>which stops Traders from being Y and<br>saying things that are untrue or<br>creating the impression that things are<br>better than they really are so that's<br>what we do in the first half of the<br>class after that we look at the personal<br>property Securities act which might<br>sound very strange but is basically the<br>act that governs all security interests<br>that are given in personal property so<br>maybe the shop where I bought these um<br>chairs had given a security interest to<br>the bank that said well you know if we<br>don't pay you can come and get all our<br>inventory um well if they sell that to<br>me is that still subject to that<br>security interest so those are all sort<br>of questions that we deal with um in the<br>second part of the class so very large<br>um range of topics all related to<br>commercial um<br>transactions um assessment I haven't<br>quite made up my mind I'm sort of seeing<br>how this year works out this year has<br>been a bit of an experiment so what I've<br>done this time was a thousand word<br>assignment and a for 10% 10% multiple<br>choice um test that was a few weeks ago<br>and I see a few of my students were<br>probably a little bit traumatized by<br>that um so will'll see if I do that<br>again um and 80% three-hour exam so have<br>any<br>questions great then I'll hand you over<br>to tresa<br>so Laura summer school course details on<br>page<br>61 thank you and um can I just tell you<br>when I was at Law School commercial law<br>was by far the most useful subject that<br>I that I studied why you're in this<br>which is why I'm now lawyer but no<br>seriously it's um actually incredibly<br>useful just in terms of life because as<br>a law student one of the things that<br>everybody keeps saying is oh I bought my<br>stereo and and actually if you do<br>commercial law you'll know what the<br>answer is okay um so I'm here to talk<br>about law of disarmament which is one of<br>the summer school offerings um this<br>summer so the classes are going to be<br>four hours a week on a Wednesday and<br>Friday um so it's going to be sort of<br>pretty intense across those weeks but<br>actually that I'm hoping will give you<br>know sort of quite a nice um uh kind of<br>feeling in the class in terms of we'll<br>be meeting so regularly um it's the<br>first time I've offered the course um<br>and I've been waiting for years to teach<br>it it's like my pet thing um so I am<br>pretty excited although the assessment<br>hasn't been approved um I am hoping to<br>have some form of a written so not a<br>sort of traditional closed book exam at<br>the end but some kind of a written um<br>piece of work uh whether we call that a<br>take-home exam or whether we call that a<br>research essay I'm not entirely sure<br>it'll need to fit in one of the things<br>we're been really conscious of in the<br>summer school is that the assessments<br>are properly staggered so it does if<br>you're doing more than one course that<br>it doesn't end up um being hideous so<br>with those practicalities out of the way<br>you can see in the handbook what I've<br>said about my course description and the<br>um content outline I think it might be<br>useful if I um maybe said to you a few<br>words about what I see as the kind of<br>themes across the course um so really<br>important theme is the role of law in<br>disarmament um because in fact it's<br>relatively unusual um there's only one<br>or two places around the world that<br>teach a course in disarmament law you<br>will find lots of it in security studies<br>or international relations so what do<br>lawyers have to say um about disarmament<br>and one of the obvious things of course<br>is that when disarmament Agreements are<br>reached they are treaties and so that<br>that is an instrument of international<br>law so in that sense lawyers need to be<br>involved but in fact um we will see that<br>there's a lot of really interesting um<br>legal questions um in terms of how<br>disarmament works and in what context it<br>works and so on a second overarching<br>theme is the changing understandings of<br>security so International lawyers have<br>tended to look at security in a very<br>monochrome kind of way so we think about<br>Syria or we think about Iraq or we think<br>about<br>Afghanistan um but in fact security is<br>very<br>multifaceted and when we start looking<br>at the transfer of weapons or the need<br>to eliminate or reduce control or track<br>weapons that our sensibilities of<br>Securities might change we are coming to<br>a point where we find some categories of<br>weapons um horrible and offensive<br>perhaps immoral and we will be looking<br>at well why do we think um and what does<br>it say about us to say for example that<br>chemical weapons are unacceptable but<br>nuclear weapons are acceptable why is<br>that and what role does law play in<br>those perceptions um and then that will<br>lead us to a third Team theme of the<br>course which is how Norms develop so<br>again generally speaking with lawyers<br>the traditional way is we're kind of not<br>really interested until we have a treaty<br>or we see it as customer international<br>law we don't really take any notice of<br>what comes comes before that and what<br>comes afterwards that's the bit that we<br>tend to obsess about I would even say<br>and in this course we're looking at<br>something much more broadly than simply<br>treaty making or customer international<br>law um so those are sort of cross themes<br>you'll see that there isn't a<br>prerequisite for you to have done<br>international law but if you have done<br>international law this is the kind of<br>course that you're likely to be<br>interested in but I will not be assuming<br>that everybody has and if people need a<br>little bit of a pickme up I will be<br>providing some guided readings um at the<br>very start or if you wanted to get into<br>those before the course happened you<br>would be more than welcome to email me<br>or come and see me to talk about that um<br>so I'm really looking forward to<br>spending my summer in the classroom um<br>and I hope that you guys are too thank<br>you thank you so la of disign is a<br>summer school course aspects of e<br>governance also a summer school 10-point<br>course<br>Tri Frederickson G and I are senior<br>Associates at Chapman trip and we are<br>going to be part of the uh team teach<br>team for the the Chapman trip presented<br>uh aspects of e governance um we build a<br>six minute units and so we are going to<br>stick to our 3 minutes here um but<br>encourage you all to read um the course<br>outline and um then uh get in touch with<br>either of us you can look us up online<br>if you do have questions about the<br>course uh so similar to tr's uh course<br>we are over 4 weeks and twice a week uh<br>Tuesdays and Thursdays so similarly<br>quite an intense course um but again we<br>hope that having that contact time uh<br>and doing it over summer means that<br>we'll be able to build up quite a bit of<br>rapport with with you who um who choose<br>to attend with us uh as a broad overview<br>this is the kind of work that we do<br>daytoday so it does give you a bit of a<br>practical insight into what lawyers uh<br>do do we're in the commercial team so it<br>has a lot of commercial aspects to it<br>which which G will elaborate on um and<br>it will just give you a bit more of an<br>oversight and insight into what people<br>mean when they talk about the ewi<br>economy so um you might have heard about<br>treaty settlements and um that's what<br>David would talk about in contemporary<br>treaty issues um but what we're talking<br>about is where the rubber hits the road<br>and people actually have to start making<br>decisions about um how they manage those<br>those treaty assets so it's an important<br>part of the fabric of Al um and<br>everybody who does it has great things<br>to say so um no my hand over to gria<br>thank you so um as T said it's a team<br>taught course um taught by senior<br>practitioners from chapmans trip we're<br>teaching you about the work that we do<br>every day um there's a bit of variety in<br>your week so yes we'll see you twice a<br>week and for three hours at a time um<br>but on a Tuesday you will hear about the<br>court aspects of of what we're looking<br>at and on a Thursday you'll hear about<br>tax but don't get frightened by the<br>concept of tax it's tax taught in a very<br>practical way um what we do across the<br>course is we look at all aspects um<br>through legal governance Charities law<br>and also tax of some of the main um<br>structures that ewi hapu and<br>postsettlement governance entities and E<br>businesses use to actually manage their<br>assets and participate in that e economy<br>that tpri was talking about so we will<br>look at companies limited Partnerships<br>trusts joint ventures all all manner of<br>legal entities generally focused through<br>um case studies examples like wui and<br>and how they operate their structure<br>naat or so something a little bit closer<br>to<br>home and and through those case studies<br>we can we can bring you along on the<br>journey of how some of these entities<br>actually get used in practice the only<br>um prerequisites are just the the part<br>two papers so you don't have to have<br>done company law for example or Equity<br>to take this paper um and the same as<br>trusser we're happy to give you um some<br>guidance on things you might want to<br>read first if if you're really Canen but<br>no prerequisite for that<br>questions cool<br>you<br>st okay so keeping the best to last<br>we'll vary the schedule a little so we<br>can get back on track so I'll defer<br>Privacy Law and ask Dr anood to address<br>us about Refugee law this to last I that<br>Refugee laws page 59 um hi everyone I'm<br>Anna and next year for the first time<br>offering an entire semester course on<br>Refugee law in the past it's always been<br>immigration and refug law immigration<br>laws is great but um decided need to<br>split the two subjects because there<br>just so much in both of them that we<br>need to be able to have entire courses<br>on both so um I'm sure you're all very<br>aware that at the moment we are in the<br>midst of a huge Refugee crisis around<br>the world we currently have around 60<br>million displaced people um it's one of<br>the highest numbers in history and it's<br>causing huge problems for large number<br>number of communities and what we do in<br>this course is look at a range of<br>different aspects of the crisis and of<br>um Refugee issues so we'll start out by<br>looking at new what happens in New<br>Zealand when people apply for Refugee<br>status and what our laws are about who a<br>refugee is um interestingly although<br>there are 60 million people who are<br>displaced from their homes a very small<br>number of them actually qualify as<br>refugees Refugee law has a whole lot of<br>different elements to it so we'll work<br>through that so you work out who's in<br>and who's out um we're then going to<br>look more broadly at the system and look<br>at some of the different mechanisms that<br>have in play around the world at the<br>moment um for how we deal with refugees<br>so one of what's happening in Europe at<br>the moment in terms of the um refugees<br>coming out of Syria and the um processes<br>have been put in place to try and deter<br>some of them and turn them back and<br>split them between different countries<br>we'll look at the policies and legality<br>of what's cing there we'll also do<br>things that look at um a bit closer to<br>home and um detention regimes that have<br>been set up in Australia and the Pacific<br>for refugees um and get have a detailed<br>look about those sorts of issues so the<br>course offers both um some of hard<br>doctrinal law and what's going on and so<br>you understand how to be a refugee<br>lawyer but it also offers a chance to<br>look at some of the policies and to<br>critique some of the things going on<br>because I think this is an area where we<br>desperately need people to be thinking<br>really critically about the system we<br>have and about where we're going and<br>what's happening because quite frankly<br>the system at the moment is broken in<br>many many ways um that's sort of<br>substance and it's on first semester<br>it's going to be twice a week so it'll<br>be an hour and a half each class um the<br>assessment will be 30% internal and 70%<br>exam 30% I haven't totally worked out<br>yet but um I've been hearing good things<br>about lecturers this semester who have<br>sort of given different hand in times<br>and done R of different forms of<br>assessment so I'm interested to think<br>about those sort of things and<br>interested if you have particular<br>thoughts um you're welcome to get in<br>touch over the next month or two and<br>have influence into that um finally I<br>guess the other thing that I try and do<br>in this course and did last year with<br>immigration and Refugee law is to bring<br>in some people um who are practicing in<br>the field both in New Zealand and<br>internationally um we have some amazing<br>um practitioners and so we do try and<br>them come into the classroom so that you<br>have a really good understanding of<br>what's happening out um in practice and<br>also last year we had a lot of people<br>being set up into different internships<br>and even if you get in different job<br>positions so definitely interested in<br>ensuring that you get seeing what's<br>happening in the real world as well as<br>um the academic side<br>questions awesome I hope to see you next<br>year um Mondays and Thursday thanks<br>guys thank you so that was the Ely<br>arrival Joe yes the truth Professor Joe<br>Manning Healthcare<br>law page 44 in your<br>booklet well you're having a Long<br>you well um healthc care law uh offered<br>in the first semester next year it's<br>co-taught between me and Ron Patterson<br>who teaches about 10 lectures um and he<br>gives the series of lectures on the<br>codee of patients rights and the health<br>and disability commissioner regi having<br>been a former health and disability<br>commissioner um it there's scarcely<br>anyone except another health and<br>disability commissioner to uh deliver<br>those lectures um we do a number of<br>topics the these can change from year to<br>year but here's an indication of some of<br>which are taught um we often start with<br>a study of the cartri inquiry<br>into um the unfortunate experiment at<br>National Women's Hospital which occurred<br>in the late 80s in New Zealand and was a<br>watershed event um we look there's an<br>introduction to Medical ethics and we<br>look at how those ethics and the<br>conflict between different ethical<br>theories are played out in actual legal<br>cases<br>um we look at forms of<br>accountability from the health and<br>disability Commissioners jurisdiction<br>two disciplinary processes and another<br>Avenue which is about civil action<br>before the um human rights review<br>tribunal<br>um there's a short section on acc<br>treatment<br>injury a key Topic in this area is<br>consent to medical treatment and what<br>constitutes a valid legal consent to<br>medical treatment and and that involves<br>a study of<br>competence um<br>voluntariness and what it is meant by a<br>truly informed consent to medical<br>treatment<br>um we look at in what circumstances a<br>health professional and give treatment<br>to somebody who's not competent to<br>consent so an incompetent adult or a<br>child who's not competent to consent um<br>rationing is an everpresent<br>uh topic or is an Ever presentes reality<br>in the delivery of health services so<br>there's often a section on rationing and<br>legal challenges to rationing decisions<br>denying people<br>treatment uh the last topic tends to<br>involve the withdrawal of life<br>sustaining treatment or Youth and Asia<br>so this year's class we looked at the<br>decision in Canada in Carter against the<br>attorney general and compared it to the<br>decision the recent decision in seals in<br>New Zealand and contrasted the um the<br>reasons for<br>decisions um open book exam 2 hour<br>the compulsory OnCourse assessment<br>element this year was a test a 30 minute<br>test a few weeks into the course we may<br>well do that again this<br>year um Medico legal problems should I<br>talk about not the thank you not be<br>honest well it is the best is the best<br>elective course offered in the faculty<br>and all my colleagues<br>agree except for<br>best thank you thank you Jan so jenet<br>please Professor jenet mlan now jenet<br>you're going to talk about the admin as<br>well as your Advanced to talk three okay<br>thank you okay um thanks very much um<br>Steven um I'm<br>teaching comparative constitutional law<br>next year it's this year called Advanced<br>Public Law doesn't that sound dull it's<br>not Dull it's um uh so it'll be a 10o<br>course next year and we talk about what<br>do we expect out of a constitution does<br>con do constitutions help us reach<br>agreement or do they create more<br>disagreement how do you get agreement<br>when there are really severely um<br>divided societies we look at a range of<br>different um kinds of constitution we<br>look at um forms of Rights um protection<br>and we look at the comparative merits of<br>different forms of Rights protection so<br>we look at the Canadian um way of<br>protecting rights we look at the<br>European ways of con protecting rights<br>we look at what should be in rights<br>protections um this year we've got uh<br>just next week Mr Jeffrey Palmer coming<br>to talk about his proposed<br>Constitution uh and all my students will<br>be armed to ask him the really difficult<br>questions about what's in it what should<br>be in it how we get it if we should get<br>it and so on<br>um the um uh so I haven't quite worked<br>out what I'm going to do in terms of um<br>how I examine that next year this year<br>there was an opinion where you took a<br>case that had been decided and you<br>changed the rights protection model and<br>then wrote the Judgment as if you were a<br>judge in a different um constitutional<br>framework uh which people seem to really<br>enjoy and sometimes lo and behold the<br>result was no different as well as<br>sometimes the results were radically<br>different um so that's uh comparative<br>constitutional law it's um theoretical<br>it's a sort of thing people who like<br>artsy sort of um subjects like um yes<br>there's some case law but that's very<br>much um secondary to the theory and and<br>helps form the theory but isn't the<br>basis of the<br>course second thing I'm teaching next<br>year is administrative law um and I'm<br>co- teing that with Dr Jane Norton<br>um and this time we'll be teaching that<br>together it's usually um Hannah wilberg<br>who teaches that course and so we'll<br>bring our own obsessions and enthusiasms<br>to that course um we want to look at<br>what makes a good decision how do<br>bureaucratic decision M makers work how<br>do corporate decision makers work and<br>how can uh judicial review Aid people to<br>make better decisions or in fact might<br>IAL review make decision making worse um<br>that could be<br>counterfactual we want to look at the<br>developing Cutting Edge bits of judicial<br>review we want to look at where<br>legitimate expectations are going where<br>mistake of fact is going uh how rights<br>Frameworks are impacting on judicial<br>review and how much difference courts um<br>will give to um decision makers<br>especially in the terrorism space and in<br>the allocation of resources<br>space um we want to look at the<br>extension of judicial review of public<br>law Norms into the private sphere into<br>Contracting um and into um commercial<br>decision making of different kinds so<br>that's what that course is about it's a<br>20o course and it'll be in the first<br>semester that's quite a big commitment<br>of time but um you'll get us doing a<br>double act and we are planning to teach<br>that together all the way through<br>um and we plan to teach I plan to teach<br>both of these courses in a seminar<br>format where there's a lot of<br>participation where you can follow your<br>interests as much as possible and bring<br>your interests to the table so um it's a<br>great uh both classes were a relatively<br>small at least on this is big as 30 30<br>so you get real chance for<br>extand the<br>third um of course I want talk about his<br>law and policy for Professor Jane Kelsey<br>she's at her mother's bedside at the<br>moment so she couldn't be here she<br>otherwise would there's a handout that<br>um we've left at the front um and some<br>of you will have seen Jane on radio<br>television she's a global commentator on<br>neoliberalism on the<br>TPP on the sorts of policy changes that<br>have swept the globe uh she's really<br>articulate and engaged in at the cutting<br>AG uh and this is a course about doing<br>policy and how policy is done how policy<br>relates to law um and the case studies<br>that they've looked at in the past or<br>this year have been at terrorism laws at<br>privatization of s soes at the Oakland<br>super City at smokes free a<br>2025 uh and in an election year next<br>year they'll be looking at a lot of<br>potential um election issues uh<br>particularly housing policy I know that<br>it's not uh very common for law students<br>to admit they want a political career<br>where while they're at law school but if<br>you do want a political career this is<br>the course for you uh this is someone<br>who really knows how uh policies made<br>behind the scenes how the policym<br>process works how the better regulation<br>less regulation framework works and how<br>regulatory impact statements work uh I<br>promise that that will be a very<br>critical and<br>engaging um course and this year it uh<br>the evaluation featured a um group case<br>study<br>30% a 5,000 word research paper based on<br>that case study or a closed book to our<br>exam the the last two uh Alternatives<br>but you all have to participate in group<br>case study that's all three makes me<br>tired thinking about next year but lots<br>of public law offerings um thank you J<br>so the history of law of obligations<br>which is shown on the schedule as<br>aspects of legal history is taught by<br>Professor Warren Swain it's a summer<br>school course and it's in your booklets<br>at<br>50 um you will note that there are<br>uh two legal history courses one can't<br>have too much legal history but perhaps<br>they ought not to be confused uh for<br>information uh the course that I am<br>offering in the summer will be taught<br>from the 11th of January uh into uh<br>February uh Thursday the 16th of<br>um and we'll be talk between 5 and 7 in<br>the evening uh on those days so there'll<br>be 4 hours a week uh so talk kind of<br>semi intensively I suppose um the<br>subject matter of this course is the<br>history of the law of obligations by<br>which I mean the history of contract Tau<br>and un just enrichment we will cover the<br>period from the Middle Ages until the uh<br>19th century um<br>this course is fundamentally about the<br>history of legal Doctrine as represented<br>in primary sources namely uh law books<br>uh case reports yearbook reports as well<br>as the secondary<br>literature it's important for those<br>taking this course not to be frightened<br>of two things um a large amount of<br>reading and uh being able to engage with<br>the primary<br>sources um those primary sources are<br>you'll be pleased to know available in<br>English so I don't expect you to know<br>more French or Latin um and those<br>primary sources are easily available<br>online through a series of databases so<br>that stuff is now quite<br>accessible um this course will be taught<br>in seminars um and it's the expectation<br>that the seminar will be run by me<br>talking for some of it and uh you to<br>engage with the materials on prior<br>reading um<br>afterwards um as far as the U assessment<br>is concerned this is a 10-point course<br>the assessment is by virtue of a 5000w<br>essay which is based on uh titles that I<br>I give you or I am happy that you choose<br>a topic providing it falls within the<br>purview of the course um in order to<br>give maximum flexibility as far as the<br>assessment is<br>concerned<br>um I will uh it's my practice with that<br>in order to assist you to write a good<br>assessment to ask you to provide an<br>optional um outline of your uh<br>assessment uh which isn't part of the<br>grading process but to give you a sense<br>of direction and feedback before you<br>write the actual<br>assessment does anyone have any<br>questions no thanks very much thank you<br>Warren so we heard earlier from Craig<br>Alf about International tax Michael<br>littlewood teaches the tax law course<br>which is offered in both semesters and<br>Advanced Tax in the second semester and<br>those entries are on pages 24 and<br>27 to um study taxt or not study text I<br>suppose is a difficult question what it<br>comes down to is whether or not you wish<br>to join the um financial and<br>intellectual Elite of the legal<br>profession if you do then obviously that<br>means being a tax specialist that<br>requires you to do the uh the basic tax<br>course and possibly also the ADV well<br>certainly also the Advanced Tax course<br>and possibly also Craig<br>uh course as well<br>yeah um no but I'll come and speak a bit<br>stand a bit closer and I'll speak a bit<br>louder<br>um of course it's just you may choose<br>not to be a um a tax specialist but you<br>may choose some other area of legal<br>practice uh such as being a commercial<br>lawyer of some kind or perhaps a<br>property lawyer of some kind if you want<br>to do either of those equally obviously<br>you will need to know something about<br>tax because your clients will be buying<br>and selling real estate or buying and<br>selling companies or developing real<br>estate those kind of things all of that<br>has tax consequences to it you might<br>think you're going to escape tax um<br>which you can by for example doing<br>family law or criminal law but even if<br>you want to be a criminal lawyer bear in<br>mind there's only three kinds of<br>criminals who got any money and there's<br>drug dealers drunk drivers and tax<br>evaders so take your pick on that the<br>um students get the best grades mostly<br>get jobs with the big law firms which<br>are the ones that practice tax grades AR<br>quite so good get a job with big<br>accounting firm uh grades aren't quite<br>so good again um the the options include<br>the Inland Revenue Department Inland<br>Revenue Department is a uh large<br>organization a major employer employed<br>lots of lawyers the way it works is<br>after a couple of years uh whoever got<br>the job at Russell MC tends to leave<br>because then they go off to London or<br>New York or Hong Kong or somewhere that<br>creates a vacancy everybody moves up one<br>um eventually what happens you work for<br>the Inland revenue and you learn all<br>their secrets after you've been doing<br>that for a couple of years then r they<br>are prepared to pay you quite a lot of<br>money um for you would come and work for<br>them and share the secrets downside is<br>after you spent a couple of years<br>working in the revenue department you<br>might have um uh got used to going home<br>at 5:00 and even more importantly you<br>might be um developed a taste for<br>wearing a cardigan to work obviously<br>that disqualifies you from working at<br>Russ MC Bay the the basic um basic tax<br>cost covers that the whole structure of<br>the tax system plus looking in a bit<br>more detail at particular aspects of it<br>um start off with tax policy looking<br>looking at questions such as for example<br>which is better income tax or GST those<br>being the two main taxes in our system I<br>know probably you've got some immediate<br>off the top of your head theory about<br>which is better income tax or GST my aim<br>however is that you should be able to<br>address that question um on some<br>theoretically sound basis rather than<br>just kind of shooting your mouth off<br>about it um so we do some uh<br>introductory policy work then looking at<br>the the whole of the tax system meaning<br>the whole of income tax the whole of GST<br>um obviously uh not in great depth but<br>selected topics in great depth uh such<br>as for example the very Troublesome<br>distinction between tax avoidance which<br>is basically those things you're allowed<br>to do so as to not pay as much tax and<br>tax evasion which are those things that<br>if you do then you cross the line and um<br>go to jail<br>um uh what else<br>um apart from the um the the<br>professional Peary benefits of studying<br>tax advantages include that you can't<br>really understand the legal system at<br>all or the political system at all or<br>the economy at all unless you understand<br>how the tax system works so so tax is<br>both very specialized subset of uh<br>commercial law and fundamentally<br>important to the way that the<br>constitution legal system and the<br>political system operate for example uh<br>naata which you might have heard of<br>probably in constitutional law what the<br>Constitution is about from before<br>magnata up until now including is what<br>is the state's power of taxation<br>um US Government got plans in the event<br>of nuclear Holocaust they've got plans<br>that will ensure the um survival of the<br>um US federal tax department the rest of<br>the government the can fall apart as<br>long as the tax department in the Army<br>are operating that they stay in business<br>um what else do I I've got any time the<br>end anyone got any questions or that's<br>enough all right thank you I see some of<br>you I hope next semester and others of<br>you the semester after that thank you<br>Michael thanks Ste so second last course<br>is competition law the details for that<br>are on page 29 and Chris teaches it<br>thank<br>you Hi and um CHR says Sten says and<br>competition is my subject um what's<br>competition law competition law is<br>really about the law that's designed to<br>protect competition and markets and um<br>we sort of look at a number of different<br>things most of it's based on the Comm so<br>we're looking at agreements that<br>restrict competition so price fixing<br>cartels of other sorts also agreements<br>between sort of um suppliers and and<br>their customers and how that can<br>actually affect competition Market sort<br>of use of a dominant position and sort<br>of merges that will restrict competition<br>the subject's probably a little<br>different from some of the other<br>subjects you look at in old school<br>because we sort of very much integrate<br>sort of an economic side to as well and<br>you don't have to have done economics at<br>all to actually do competitional but we<br>sort of very much think about sort of<br>what the economic rationale and the<br>ideas is behind competition there are<br>and particular decisions that are made<br>as<br>well so it's it gives you a different<br>perspective of law compared to what<br>you've looked at in other subjects as<br>well and sort of that sort of approach<br>to law and thinking about markets and<br>the integration of in economics also is<br>relevant for other subjects as well<br>other areas of Regulation or or business<br>that you may find yourself involved<br>throughout your life as well what else<br>have I got to say um not a lot any<br>questions thank you thank<br>you so I said we keep the best to last<br>and the best is of course Privacy Law um<br>so just very briefly on that elective<br>details of which you're on page 59 in<br>your course book our Privacy Law is<br>offered only every second or third year<br>not every year so it was last offered as<br>an undergraduate elective in 2014 and it<br>will be offered in the first semester<br>next year and it will almost certainly<br>not be offered in 2018 so if you're in<br>part three next year and you think you<br>might defer it to the year after chances<br>are it won't be there so grab it while<br>it's going if you're interested uh<br>Privacy Law in New Zealand is<br>underdeveloped and one of the reasons<br>that it's underdeveloped is because<br>there is no clear idea of what the law<br>is trying to protect so in the first<br>part of this 10-point course which has<br>only 24 hours of Class 2 hours of away<br>Tuesday and Thursday mornings um we look<br>at the concept of privacy um the<br>interest with which privacy competes and<br>some sources of Privacy Law so that's<br>the first three classes up until the mid<br>semester break the rest of the course is<br>concerned with the common laws response<br>so we have a New Zealand two different<br>privacy TS we ask ourselves do we<br>actually need them both do they need any<br>refin<br>do we need any more privacy TS the<br>Americans have four are the third and<br>fourth of the American ones of interest<br>to us is there still a need within our<br>common law for some privacy protection<br>and to get a handle on that we also look<br>to the UK Canada and Australia those<br>cognite jurisdictions to see how they go<br>about protecting Privacy Law through the<br>courts so the first half of the course<br>is common law focused the second half<br>looks at uh statutory protection of<br>privacy and we have an array of St<br>Provisions in New Zealand the Privacy<br>Act obviously which is in for a major<br>overhaul and various Provisions<br>scattered around different statutes but<br>they don't provide comprehensive<br>coverage and so we think about whether<br>any more statutory protection is needed<br>or can the common law take up the slack<br>and then in the last few classes we<br>begin to apply our understanding of<br>Privacy Law in various areas various<br>context various Industries and so<br>on the way the course is assessed given<br>that it's own a 10-point course um it<br>has at the end either a 2-hour exam<br>weight at as 80% or a research paper in<br>Le of that exam on any privacy topic and<br>that would be 4,000 words so that would<br>satisfy that sustained writing<br>requirement so either a research paper<br>or an exam at the end 80% the other 20%<br>comes from a<br>1,000w written assignment during the<br>semester and I say during the semester<br>because I'll set three or four different<br>topics scattered throughout the semester<br>and you can choose any one according to<br>what is convenient for you to fit around<br>commitments uh so usually because this<br>is a developing area and there's a lot<br>of interest there is scope as I said for<br>students to write research papers on<br>topics of Interest usually about 30 40%<br>of the class choose to do so otherwise<br>the exam um itself the alternative would<br>have a fair measure of choice within it<br>including an opportunity to talk about<br>any particular aspect of privacy that<br>you might be interested in or<br>motivated okay any questions yes just in<br>terms<br>ofes they have option of<br>research what point do you make decision<br>um normally if you are going to present<br>a research paper and L of exam at the<br>end you need to have decided on your<br>topic and had it approv by the end of<br>the fourth week so you've got the first<br>third of the semester to say well I<br>don't want to sit the exam I'd rather<br>avoid the exam and just focus on my<br>particular interest and and you usually<br>get an of kind of yeah and what the<br>possibilities are and if you're stuck<br>for an idea and you still want to do a<br>research paper undoubtedly the teacher<br>will be able to suggest a variety of<br>topics to you as I would be happy to do<br>in respective<br>privacy okay well any questions or<br>criticisms or comments about anything<br>that we've covered this afternoon any of<br>that generic stuff that may still be<br>no they don't um so while if you look at<br>the way in which the hand uh the sort of<br>the prospectus or the handbook set out<br>the degree structure it suggests that<br>you must do uh land Equity jurist law<br>399 and ethics in part three there is no<br>necessity to do that there's a very good<br>reason to do land and equity in part<br>three well two good reasons one is that<br>they are year long and if you were to<br>defer either of them that would preclude<br>the possib possibility of going on<br>Exchange in part four and about 25% of<br>our students do go on Exchange in part<br>four so land and Equity at least should<br>be done in part three as for jurists law<br>399 and ethics you need to do them<br>before you finish your degree but they<br>don't have to be in your part three year<br>they can be deferred and those three<br>courses are all offered in both the<br>first and second semester each year so<br>you could put off ethics if you wanted<br>until your final semester and the same<br>applies to jurus and to R 399 as<br>well is there on the number of papers<br>you can do a semester there's not a<br>limit on the number of papers you can do<br>in a semester there's a limit on the<br>number of points that's just a<br>university wide limit and that is a<br>maximum of 80 points in the first<br>semester 80 points in the second<br>semester 30 points in summer school so<br>that's 80 plus 80 plus 30 but there's an<br>annual limit of<br>170 if you're really Keen to do more<br>than 80 points in a semester then the<br>faculty or the associate Dean has the<br>discretion to override the points limits<br>and Grant to a concession if you want to<br>do more than 170 points in the year as a<br>whole then you have to make a special<br>application to the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor academic and it's hard to get<br>approval for<br>that so it's not the number of courses<br>it's it's the points bearing in mind<br>that the courses have different waiting<br>anything else yeah do you know when the<br>assessment structure for the courses<br>will be confirmed um it's pretty much<br>sedu for most courses there are just a<br>few details so it's unfortunate that it<br>says all the way through here to be<br>confirmed um the the questions are only<br>around where there is a proposal to have<br>a test in an elective course it just<br>gets very difficult to schedule a whole<br>lot of tests given that we've got to do<br>it also for all the compulsory courses<br>in part two and for land and equity and<br>part three and for Lauren society and<br>for legal method so um where there has<br>been a test in an elective course this<br>year that may be replaced by a written<br>assignment there's one other refinement<br>for next year this was the first year<br>where we had compulsory coursework in<br>all of our electives and there were some<br>teething problems and in particular<br>there were some bottlenecks where<br>several assignments would be due around<br>the same time so we're looking at<br>spreading them out more over the<br>semester we're looking at doing more<br>widely what I'm proposing with privacy<br>and to give a variety of assignments and<br>say you've got to do one but you choose<br>which one and the timing is up to you<br>um as far as tests are concerned there<br>may be tests but that's unlikely um most<br>of the details will be settled within<br>the next week or two and hopefully by<br>the time therefore that you come to<br>enroll online which you can do as I said<br>from the 7th of November that<br>available nothing else okay well then<br>just it remains for me to thank you for<br>your attendance and your attention<br>throughout the 2 hours good luck
