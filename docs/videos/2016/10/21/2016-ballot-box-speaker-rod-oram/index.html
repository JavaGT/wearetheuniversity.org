accurate.</p><p>um garoto and good evening and thank you<br>very much indeed and barium for for<br>inviting me along tonight to talk about<br>one of my favorite subjects which is<br>Auckland and although I do have plenty<br>of favorite subjects I just make sure I<br>got the right controls here okay and<br>we're off so this is about a truly<br>sustainable Tamaki Makaurau which is<br>another aspect of reinventing paradise<br>and this is what it looked at like<br>shortly after Morgan was founded that<br>was September eighteen eighteen forty<br>this was just in the years after that<br>and John Logan Campbell writes very<br>brilliantly about the city he had a<br>great vision for here so the question is<br>what will we make of auckland by the<br>time we get to our bicentenary of the<br>city on sent the 18 18 20 40 in 2007 the<br>Tate Modern gallery in london had an<br>exhibition about urbanization because<br>that was the year that the United<br>Nations deemed that for the first time<br>in human history the majority of people<br>lived in cities and but we're heading<br>very fast to round about eighty percent<br>of people living in cities and these<br>were a couple of posters I took at the<br>time and you can see on the right how<br>important and cities are in terms of<br>carbon footprints on the bike and so<br>that it's a massive impact and it posed<br>really important questions I considers<br>be improved by design and very crucially<br>considers promote social justice and<br>greater equality that's what social<br>justice looks like in San Paolo and<br>that's middle class housing in San Paulo<br>and that's Los Angeles today or a few<br>years ago which is actually remarkably<br>regenerated it regenerated and also<br>Chicago in recent years so a major<br>cities in the world are making some<br>fantastic steps forward and but the<br>future will be very different indeed<br>because cities are going to have to<br>become far more self-sufficient for<br>energy and probably food too and they<br>also need to be delightful place to live<br>and work so where might open go in that<br>and who hands up who thinks that Oakland<br>if anybody thinks often has a low carbon<br>plan is anybody involved in that low<br>carpenter right there is a low-carbon<br>man and and I'm sorry I don't need this<br>brutally about people who are involved<br>but this is a measure of how difficult<br>this is because it's actually quite a<br>good plan it's just nobody's<br>operationalizing it very much so I'll<br>just take a few slides of this so this<br>is carbon footprint per capita per year<br>in various cities of the world<br>Auckland's not that high although major<br>cities like London and New York are a<br>lot lower and then we have some<br>massively big cities in terms of carbon<br>footprint so Auckland's 20 to 40 target<br>is three tons per person in 2014 that's<br>where Copenhagen is today and Copenhagen<br>plans to be carbon neutral by 2030 and<br>so that's the sort of benchmark we're<br>chasing you can see the very big<br>ambitions here the dark blue right<br>reading from right to left and it's a<br>Vancouver eighty percent reduction by<br>2050 oaklands fifty percent and then you<br>can see some other time frames there so<br>Brooklyn is a best in the middle of the<br>pack on that the three big areas of<br>carbon emissions are stationary energy<br>on the left and industrial process<br>emissions quite a bit ly could do<br>around that say biomass for example and<br>indeed an industrial scale pv won't be<br>too far away and but the big problem<br>down there is a third of it is a land<br>transport ie and vehicles this is that<br>what it looks like households typically<br>they're half our carbon footprint is<br>food forty percent commuting by car<br>household energy and waste don't really<br>count in that although the waste is<br>important to get down to zero waste<br>that's the greenhouse gas footprint and<br>but foods going to be very very hard for<br>Orton ders to knock on the head as is<br>indeed a commuting back are so there are<br>plans and or ambition so around travel<br>down the bottom there thirty to forty<br>percent of cars here in Auckland by 2040<br>would be electric and I think that would<br>be possible but with very very much more<br>ambitious plans and policies and then<br>the government has at the moment which<br>largely consists of Simon Bridges<br>running around the country opening rapid<br>charges and some of which are free from<br>Becca Cara Maria night Evan on energy<br>also the dominant view of energy is<br>still about a 19th century reticulated<br>heavy industrial view of electricity<br>that's certainly one electricity<br>Association Authority promotes in<br>regulatory terms and vector is one of<br>the exceptions to that in understanding<br>how local generation and local lines<br>companies and are part of a very<br>important very resilient smart grid and<br>that again we've got none of the right<br>policy settings coming down from<br>Wellington and the help make that happen<br>so the likes of vector is pushing hard<br>very hard against that Auckland also<br>believes that given the very substantial<br>part of the city which is actually<br>forests and agriculture and regional<br>parks is that there is a great<br>opportunity to add to the carbon since<br>in Auckland which would be good and but<br>it would also be better if we also<br>thought even more ambitiously for<br>example<br>purging our back gardens of exotics and<br>trying to get more about that gardeners<br>baton to natives for example would be a<br>truly big push on sustainability and<br>then last but not least the low carbon<br>plan is very terrestrial but the very<br>important part of Auckland<br>sustainability issue is the hierarchy<br>golf and we seriously abuse the high<br>rocky golf and in all sorts of ways from<br>stormwater to sediment to live a fishing<br>and and all the all the rest an<br>incredibly important piece of work very<br>huge piece of work is coming to fruition<br>later on this year with the hierarchy<br>Gulf marine spatial plan under the Latin<br>name of sea change and this is going to<br>be terrifically important but again it<br>won't work unless central government and<br>changes a lot of legislation to be able<br>to make this work so so many of the<br>things that we have an ambition to do in<br>Auckland we have completed the robin<br>central government settings for and that<br>we're very lacking on local government<br>engagement on this so you know these are<br>great plans within Council but when for<br>example just this week on tuesday i was<br>monday and tuesday i was chairing a<br>transport infrastructure conference here<br>it open and on Tuesday we had seven of<br>the nineteen mayoral candidates we had<br>them for about an hour and 20 minutes<br>quizzing them on transport<br>infrastructure and two of the seven on<br>the panel were climbing deniers and only<br>one of the candidates there david haye<br>from the green party and had any concept<br>and what he was getting personally<br>mentioned climate change in his opening<br>comments he was the only person who was<br>putting forward any kind of policies<br>about driving and open to a low-carbon<br>future so there is great ambition there<br>is a great opportunity<br>really make this one of the great sis is<br>the world I mean this is the most<br>extraordinary natural setting between<br>three hours because thanks to the super<br>sitting you got part of the character as<br>well and between obviously fabulous Bush<br>pad pills and out to the Western I<br>attacker isn't down to the southeast and<br>her nose this is a remarkable remarkable<br>place and we're kind of hanging on by<br>our fingertips here in terms of the very<br>fine line between trashing and enhancing<br>the place and the usually plan will help<br>in some respects and that a lot of the<br>important drivers that would have helped<br>do this and have not come through in the<br>unitary plan and so there's terrific<br>work for the new council new bear to do<br>and to try to build some that back in<br>but to use a well-known phrase from a<br>central government leader at the end of<br>the day it actually comes down to us<br>because we're talking about truly global<br>issues and that the only progress<br>happened is locally and with individuals<br>with communities and so this is actually<br>about us wanting this to happen and I'd<br>say one of the most disappointing things<br>about all this could when I have<br>occasions to facilitate various events<br>about walking so for example I twice<br>earlier this year I've done and large<br>dinners with business leaders and I've<br>asked them people to tell me what's<br>their favorite place in Auckland and<br>what's a place that they think they'd<br>like to visit they haven't visited yet<br>and it's remarkably hard to get people<br>to say what they love about open we're<br>in the very special places only and love<br>standing on top of Bastion point for<br>example and or and you know I could wax<br>very lyrical about the city so I think<br>we're still lacking a very deep<br>engagement here and it's partly because<br>all there was a human population we are<br>more urbanized than France or Germany or<br>the UK or the United States with more<br>urbanized those countries we still<br>define ourselves as a nation that as a<br>people by our rural and wild parts so my<br>final point is if Auckland is going the<br>Tamaki Makaurau is going to be truly<br>sustainable we've got to start defining<br>ourselves by urban sustainability and<br>giving a very strong out arrow and New<br>Zealand expression in that to the world<br>in how we design build run live in our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
