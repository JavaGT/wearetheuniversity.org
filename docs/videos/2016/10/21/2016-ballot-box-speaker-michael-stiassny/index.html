makes Peter<br>quite old and<br>Helen who works for me longer than most<br>people did hello mother 20 years or I<br>wasn't far wrong so that's quite good<br>and I<br>usually talk about things completely<br>differently than most people tonight<br>would be no different<br>so I'll look at it at a different level<br>and I'll share with you some thoughts<br>from<br>the the suit end of town I guess is the<br>best way to put it<br>before I start just like everyone to do<br>what I think we don't do in New Zealand<br>and it's one of our biggest weaknesses<br>and we don't think about what's<br>happening in the world enough and the<br>impact that it has on the way people<br>engage so if you just<br>close your eyes and kind of think about<br>what's going on the world really changed<br>I think will visibly change with bricks<br>it an amazing vote occurred David<br>Cameron even our<br>friend Boris didn't realize what the<br>outcome was going to be and they were on<br>opposing sides so there was a vote that<br>changed the structure of<br>European society in English society<br>really really important<br>we've got them and it has just<br>said I've just been in Washington and<br>the conference<br>amazing time in America where we had two<br>candidates I don't think any American is<br>actually proud of the fact that they are<br>the two candidates regardless of where<br>they said that is a shocking outcome for<br>what most people will some people<br>describe as the greatest country in the<br>world<br>we've got<br>italy in the next two or three months<br>we'll probably have a vote on whether it<br>stays in the EU I think every newspaper<br>you read in the world will tell you for<br>China is on the brink of a financial<br>movement and the impact of which could<br>be dramatic for all of us and it goes on<br>so I think just what and sorry I most<br>probably most relevant to us as Malcolm<br>Turnbull goes to the polls because he<br>wants to tidy up his position and make<br>sure he's comfortable and he ends up<br>with less power and Pauline Hanson<br>having an amazing number of<br>what he called the politicians I mean<br>having one for Pauline Hanson was too<br>many so anyway so I think you need to<br>just just remember that I'll try and<br>bring it together<br>I'm not talking about electricity and<br>I'm not going to talk about Tesla more<br>than happy to talk about that in<br>question time and right thank you very<br>much for are talking about and what<br>we're trying to do in victor because i<br>think we are trying to be different<br>sustainability from where I sit in its<br>true meaning is to nourish and uphold<br>life<br>so I think sustainability is going to<br>become synonymous for survival and i<br>don't mean about<br>quite the same level of climate change<br>but about social fabric of society and<br>to me survival of society itself is<br>i've been really blessed this year i<br>have traveled a lot being quite lucky<br>normally i don't but the one thing i<br>think you get when you travel is that<br>family makara is actually probably one<br>of the best places in the world we have<br>been actually really really lucky to end<br>up in this place the real issue is<br>whether being that lucky we have done<br>enough with it or whether we are going<br>to do enough with it to maintain our<br>right hable plunders a great city so if<br>you just simply look around everywhere<br>in the world everyone's doing something<br>to allow them to survive so Moscow's<br>even building an inner city rail network<br>because it's actually one of the worst<br>places in the world to drive<br>London's built a new underground<br>Washington's building a railway line to<br>the airport Sydney's pulled out all its<br>in the city and is starting again so the<br>list goes on<br>unfortunately have we done enough my gut<br>feel is<br>we actually<br>haven't because when we look at society<br>and we look at the people that have<br>actually been affected most by all of<br>those things that I think are happening<br>in society what we're seeing as middle<br>class is actually being<br>disenfranchised and is disappearing the<br>middle class of our world is actually<br>really important how the people who live<br>in San Delia survive and how the people<br>who live in in Kota who and South<br>Auckland survive we actually need<br>people to be able to live in Auckland so<br>that we can get the structure of the<br>work so we need nurses to be able to<br>live and work here we need teachers to<br>be able to live and work here we need<br>policemen we even need office workers a<br>victor to want to come and work there<br>what we're facing at the moment is that<br>those people are looking at their<br>alternatives for very simple reasons the<br>southern motorway is becoming<br>exceedingly clothes now I used to live<br>in near their family they used to engage<br>with their family but they actually want<br>to have a house they want to have a<br>garden they want the children to<br>understand what are the things that we<br>were brought up to cherish so they're<br>moving further and further down that<br>road it takes roughly as long to come<br>from the bottom of the sub motorway as<br>it does to live in San Francisco San<br>Francisco is dealing with exactly the<br>same issue the issue is that they don't<br>want to do that so they're going to go<br>and move and we've seen this to Tauranga<br>Hawke's Bay Nelson wherever they can go<br>they can give good schooling<br>get a good job they can get a really<br>good lifestyle and they probably had<br>some money left behind so to me the most<br>fundamental issue that we face from a<br>sustainable point of view we have to fix<br>the southern motorway I got a petition<br>when I got home this morning we should<br>fix the waterfront quite sure what that<br>was about I think we need to focus on<br>the big things and to me that is one of<br>the most fundamental issues is making<br>Auckland a place where the middle class<br>can't afford to live and will lift<br>because without them we are not going to<br>the second issue I'd like to discuss<br>because i think it's and I'm Helen Helen<br>will know more than anyone else I'm not<br>a farmer and I don't relate too well to<br>the country I'm an urban boy<br>our waterways are critical to us and<br>they're critical to us on a number of<br>aspects and wearing a suit I'll just<br>talk about the suit has next the first<br>thing is the tourism has become the<br>biggest thing and sorry i should say i<br>really am frustrated with Mick Smith<br>because I do not understand the word<br>Wade so he's going to make my rivers way<br>table and my no way dab'll means i'm a<br>gonna wear those things that some people<br>do when they fish does that mean a brain<br>or am i going to do with small gumboots<br>or big gum boots to me every River in<br>this country has got to be one where I<br>can walk through and I can swim that's<br>it there is no other middle ground<br>that's for me on a personal level but<br>also much more on a business level so<br>from tourism point of view New Zealand<br>green is a great logo a hundred percent<br>pure is what every foreigner will come<br>to New Zealand for but over time we've<br>forgotten to tie the words and meaning<br>together and I think it's a really big<br>issue for tourism then we come to the<br>other big industry we have in this<br>country and it's called farm in your<br>agriculture and<br>I'm a believer in conscious capitalism<br>I think whole foods is one of the most<br>amazing stores in the world it's very<br>expensive and i agree with that but it<br>is an amazing store and that is about in<br>very simplistic terms like I know it's<br>about one we should have organic and 2<br>we should have tradable<br>products so we can understand the<br>quality and<br>everything has to be good we can't get<br>our products into whole food Whole Foods<br>whole foods should have new zealand<br>products on every level it doesn't<br>because we don't know enough about<br>making sure that our hundred percent<br>green works and to me if we don't get<br>that right we're not going to be<br>sustainable the relevance of that is<br>Auckland needs the rest of the country<br>to survive and the prosper and we need<br>so<br>then we come to<br>the final point that I need to make and<br>why is this relevant to suits what's<br>happening around the world and what's<br>with those issues that I first raised<br>and hopefully this comes together is<br>that the legitimacy of governments is<br>weakening that's really critical<br>if it's weakening and and surveys in<br>America actually show<br>at the same time unfortunately<br>the faith and respect that businesses<br>had in the world is also falling so<br>there's a survey than America recently<br>where CEOs are actually rated less<br>trustworthy than politicians not sure<br>who did it but let's just run with us<br>but if we come back to the fundamentals<br>of faith and integrity and what<br>capitalism should be we can understand<br>what people are losing faith in it it is<br>inconceivable that a CEO of a banker<br>noon 20 million dollars when a teller<br>discerning found just about the minimum<br>wage doesn't make sense and you know if<br>you're sitting outside that environment<br>you have got to be questioning it<br>the Americans are looking at moving<br>their minimum wage overtime for fifteen<br>dollars it's an amazing thing for them<br>to want to do<br>they're buying into this concept far<br>more than we are but we do need to take<br>on board that we have an obligation<br>so at the moment there's a void as I<br>said we don't trust Hillary we don't<br>trust Trump and the reasons for each one<br>while we don't trust them and it goes<br>right round the world we're kind of<br>living in a vacuum because john key to<br>has<br>created the one thing he has done that I<br>balloon that<br>makes us feel really good about who we<br>are and how we're going without taking<br>account of what else is happening but if<br>we look outside there is a complete<br>collapse there's a vacuum when there is<br>a vacuum something fills it if you leave<br>the vacuum empty then populism popular<br>ISM will take over that can't be good<br>for capitalism<br>so if you believe in capitalism and you<br>want it to continue which is everyone in<br>the suit you actually need to do<br>something and what we're seeing is and I<br>really blew me away is that the<br>directors and the businessman in America<br>actually saying we need to do something<br>some of them are saying we need to fill<br>the void because simply it's the only<br>way we'll retain what we're doing some<br>of them are saying we actually need to<br>fill the void because we're over 40<br>we've made a hell of a lot of money and<br>we actually have an obligation to do<br>something and they should be applauded<br>but we should also applaud those for<br>business purpose we're running out of<br>time oh<br>pretty much okay<br>we need to do that the real question<br>will be can the businessman of New<br>Zealand of the directors of New Zealand<br>actually appreciate that obligation and<br>step up and do it because they will need<br>to change to do it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
