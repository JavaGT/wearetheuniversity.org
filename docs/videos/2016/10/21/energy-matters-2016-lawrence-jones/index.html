my timezone is all messed up<br>so but it's a pleasure being here it is<br>my<br>probably my ninth visit to New Zealand<br>over the last decade and<br>my second visit to the University of<br>Auckland the last time I was here I give<br>a little talk to a group of students who<br>were doing some work with Professor boys<br>and we had some good conversations and<br>discussions and I was one of those who<br>ventured to disagree with the professor<br>which you shouldn't do but I did<br>nonetheless not in a negative way just I<br>just had my own thoughts on a couple of<br>things but it's it's a pleasure being<br>here and I really want to thank Bassel I<br>think my being here is a testament to<br>the fact that we're in a very hyper<br>connected word world because when I got<br>the invitation the email that came first<br>I was kind of like New Zealand<br>University of Auckland it's not<br>professor voice so who was this guy<br>but it turned out that we were connected<br>through a connect a connection I had<br>from my time when I was doing some work<br>in France working very closely with<br>folks at the IEA and it turned out that<br>one of Professor shops student Steve<br>Hyman who's here was the one who got me<br>into this trouble if you may by<br>suggesting that I Bassel invite me and<br>we went back and forth to make it work<br>and we chose perhaps the most<br>interesting month to do this thing which<br>is the month of November October go into<br>November which means everything I'm<br>about to say here is my view and no one<br>else's view because I may have to make<br>sure I find my way back into the US<br>after November 8 depending on how things<br>go<br>but not no offense but it's great to be<br>here and and I love New Zealand I come<br>here like I said quite a bit spend a lot<br>of time in Wellington for all these<br>reasons because that's where you have to<br>your seat of government and so I've<br>spent some good moments there haven't<br>discussions about the electricity market<br>and all that good stuff so today what<br>I'd like to do is to talk about what I<br>call the future of electricity and<br>generation and consumption and you<br>notice that I left the pot in between<br>out of this conversation for a second<br>which is the the infrastructure the grid<br>that connects both sides because that<br>would take maybe ten trips in New<br>Zealand first to sort of get to that<br>discussion about what it means in terms<br>of the future of the infrastructure but<br>want to talk about the generation and<br>consumption side of things because I<br>think as we look forward to the the<br>future those are the two aspects of<br>electricity that will shape how the grid<br>evolves I always tell people that<br>technology with regards to the grid is<br>not an issue we can build any<br>sophisticated grid you want the question<br>is what do you do with a grid and what<br>you do with the grid is determined by<br>what happens on the generation side and<br>on the consumption side and I want to do<br>it in the context of three words three<br>words that I think will define the<br>future of electricity one is centralized<br>decentralized and hyper connectivity and<br>as I go to my presentation you will see<br>why and typically when I do these kinds<br>of talks<br>I kind of know the audience very well in<br>a sense that it's either very hyper<br>academic or is hyper non-academic this<br>is a mixed audience and so I'll try to<br>not veer too much into the the physics<br>that Bassel talked about the physics of<br>the grid but bear with me if I do get<br>there it's just by nature what I do but<br>I'll try to keep at a high level and<br>want to sort of make this more of an<br>interactive conversation so I know I<br>have about a next 40 minutes to talk but<br>if there's a burning question that comes<br>up if I see something that really gets<br>you disagreement what I'm saying or you<br>were very happy about it you can stand<br>up clap but don't throw anything at me<br>because I can't see right now I'm says<br>too tired<br>so we got a lot of changes in front of<br>us and I think as we talk about this<br>issue of the future of electricity<br>change is something that we'll be<br>grappling with as we go forward and<br>before I get into that just one or two<br>slides about the Edison like freaking<br>stitute we are an institute that was<br>founded about a hundred years ago<br>and basically focus only investor-owned<br>utilities in terms of the domestic<br>program working on policy working on<br>technology working on business models<br>everything that makes investor utilities<br>work if you may we also have an<br>international program which I run the<br>program has about 70 members in about 60<br>countries hence hence my timezone is<br>always messed up because I'm always<br>going to one of those countries and we<br>have quite a few members in this part of<br>the world both in New Zealand and<br>Australia<br>and there you can see a pretty much sort<br>of a global overview of where we have<br>our membership and the interesting thing<br>is most of the members around the world<br>are not just investor owned utilities<br>one of the things I eye prides itself<br>about is making sure that access to the<br>work of E I is not just constrained to<br>invest on utilities so the international<br>membership consists of both<br>municipalities government-owned<br>state-owned utilities as well as private<br>utilities so that's sort of a two slides<br>about E I so<br>as we talk about the future one of one<br>thing that is interesting is it's all<br>relative to your time horizon<br>some people have a very short time<br>horizon if you think about the business<br>cycles and you talk to people on a stock<br>market their time horizon is pretty much<br>the next day with regards to investments<br>and making sure that you're turning<br>around<br>investments you're making but when we<br>start thinking about something like<br>energy the time horizon discussion<br>becomes interesting because if you take<br>a long time horizon like a 50 year<br>horizon to a hundred your horizon it's<br>very easy because then you can make all<br>kinds of bold predictions for one reason<br>100 years from now most of us in this<br>room will not be around so we can<br>speculate anything we want about the<br>future no one cares because we won't be<br>here but the closer we get to where we<br>live now in terms of 30 years 20 years<br>15 years 20 years 10 years then it gets<br>a little bit more difficult because if I<br>make a prediction today 5 years from now<br>someone in this room is gonna say<br>Laurence you said this and you were<br>wrong so what we do when it comes to<br>predicting the future we're very very<br>very cautious when it comes to the near<br>term prediction because we know we don't<br>get we don't want to get it wrong so we<br>are cautious we don't want to take risks<br>or make bold predictions but this<br>evening we're gonna be very bullish<br>we're gonna speculate above the shuk<br>term and then long term and some of the<br>things I will see it tonight may<br>sit well with some of you in fact let me<br>just make the normal disclaimer I'm<br>about to say things that are only my<br>view and not Edison Electric Institute<br>view nor are they the views of any of my<br>member companies so now I'm free to say<br>what I want to say<br>but but that's something to think about<br>the time horizon and as we talk about<br>the time horizon there are a couple of<br>challenges were facing as a global<br>you know world<br>energy water climate population increase<br>so these are just four I make sure you<br>can come up with a whole bunch of others<br>right so these are sort of a Grand<br>Challenges that as we think about the<br>future of electricity we have to think<br>about it in terms of these challenges<br>and they're interesting about these four<br>challenges is that they're interrelated<br>and what's even more interesting is that<br>their interrelationship is<br>dependent on one another in the sense<br>that if one goes up the other goes up<br>the more people you have on the planet<br>the more water they consume the more<br>water they consume the more energy they<br>need so there's a very bad equation in<br>the mathematician here so you hear but<br>these sort of a none solve NP problems<br>well there is a non solvable problem<br>because everything is moving in the same<br>direction so it makes for chaos because<br>everything is increasing there's no<br>decrease increase energy increase<br>population increase impact on the<br>climate increase need for water so how<br>do you design a system when everything<br>is increasing the only way things might<br>decrease in this contest in this<br>construct is if something begins to go<br>down but the driver for those things<br>going up I mean I want them to go down<br>and the drivers actually are you me<br>because we all want things to keep going<br>up you know this constant thing about<br>growth everything has to keep growing<br>and growing and growing<br>so you have this dependency<br>you need electricity to have electricity<br>you need water<br>right<br>well you need water to get water you<br>need electricity<br>so I'm supposed to balance an equation<br>that will look at these two things both<br>going up and down but for one to go up<br>the other has to go up if one goes down<br>the other goes down if both go down well<br>we have an issue because then the<br>economy doesn't go up so how do you<br>balance that system how do you predict a<br>future when everything's supposed to go<br>up but if everything goes up we end up<br>in chaos<br>because everything can not perpetually<br>go up<br>so creatures are characterized by what<br>they eat<br>creatures are characterized by what they<br>eat and I'm sure you know some of these<br>you know carnivore omnivore Mexico<br>carnivore mass a carnivore hyper<br>carnivore herbivore<br>pissy war and the list goes on I had to<br>stop because it's so many vorse but the<br>interesting thing is creatures are<br>characterized by what they eat and<br>so meet the newest creatures there are<br>three therein of ours there Infowars and<br>their aqua vores these are the 21st<br>century humans and the problem with<br>these new creatures that kind of have<br>all three characteristics is that energy<br>consumption water consumption<br>information consumption that's the hyper<br>connectivity they're all connected and<br>so as we look at designing electricity<br>systems for the future those three<br>things those three creatures have to be<br>managed now think about it's just<br>evening you are one of those three in<br>fact you're all of them you're both in<br>interwar a word I came up with a couple<br>of years ago when I was so frustrated in<br>trying to understand why humans are so<br>crazy with regard to energy consumption<br>I made up this word an award which is<br>actually not a word but now it's become<br>a word because I've used it for the past<br>five years and then Infowars right now<br>we have our cell phones we're suck we<br>consumer information beyond our own<br>imagination we don't even know what<br>we're consuming we probably like fat<br>over information I call it the<br>information fad the obesity of<br>information I mean you all sitting here<br>and information wise we're all obese<br>why I don't know try having an<br>information diet for a day you go crazy<br>you walk around like you're crazy your<br>cell phone is not ringing oh my god no<br>one loves me and you keep asking for it<br>not realizing that every time you get a<br>message on your cell phone there is an<br>energy consumption going on and<br>the data centers that will serve your<br>information those data centers that are<br>we're in Iceland sitting somewhere we're<br>supposed to be cool well they need a lot<br>of energy<br>so you're sitting in New Zealand as an<br>info war not realizing that every time<br>you download your email you're sucking<br>energy from the planet and by the way<br>that energy is also sucking water<br>so that's us the 21st century humans and<br>you're asking me as an engineer and<br>other engineers to build an electricity<br>system that will feed you energy feed<br>your information and by the way make<br>sure you can buy clean water whenever<br>you need it that's a challenge<br>but the interesting thing is humans are<br>not so dumb<br>so we've realized that we have to fix<br>this issue of consuming information<br>water and energy<br>in a way that will make this planet<br>sustainable in the long run so we all<br>have these common goals we go to these<br>meetings like Paris and enjoy caviar and<br>eat you know foie gras and drink wine<br>and enjoy and come back and we have a<br>common goal<br>but then we all have different pathways<br>so again you're asking me as an engineer<br>and other engineers here to build the<br>electricity system for the future but we<br>all have different ways to get there<br>so how do we get to that future how do<br>we transition from a world of<br>overconsumption of energy water and<br>information to a world that will the<br>future livable for those to come after<br>us<br>so that brings us to a dilemma the<br>dilemma and we can have a dilemma<br>discussion for all three of these<br>different<br>Wars<br>information water and energy let's focus<br>on energy because that's closer to<br>electricity and the dilemma we have is<br>that today they're about 1.3 billion<br>people in the world who act lack access<br>to electricity<br>and we're asking those people to help to<br>keep us on there certain temperature to<br>avoid climate catastrophe<br>but then we're telling those people that<br>should also develop their standard of<br>living<br>so the dilemma is<br>develop get out of poverty but you can<br>only use what we consider to be clean<br>energy you can't use dirty energy<br>because it's not good for the rest of us<br>but the rest of us have it pretty good<br>so we can afford to talk about clean<br>energy because we are no longer poor<br>but if I'm poor in one of those regions<br>of the world and I'm looking at the rest<br>of the world that's lit up I'm like this<br>makes no sense<br>you guys stay in New Zealand New Zealand<br>always lost on my map but anyway but you<br>guys in New Zealand have it pretty good<br>it's easier to sit in New Zealand and<br>tell these folks in<br>Africa or in India or in parts of Latin<br>America you can't you got to use clean<br>energy because it has to be sustainable<br>but is it economically feasible and if<br>it's not again you're asking me you<br>asking engineers you're asking us to<br>build an electricity system that will<br>provide electricity to the entire world<br>in a way that's sustainable<br>but what does that do with generation<br>what fuel source do we use to electrify<br>the world and in fact to be a bit<br>so the transition we're gonna undergo to<br>be able to electrify the world to build<br>the next generation electricity system<br>always face two questions one is it<br>gonna be evolutionary or two is it gonna<br>be disruptive<br>now economists like you know professor<br>christeson<br>has this disruptive technology theory<br>and I think it's great makes sense<br>but then you have the need for stability<br>so some disruptions are good but imagine<br>if you disrupted the electricity system<br>because of a transition and that<br>disruption led to all kinds of chaos in<br>terms of how the grid works in terms of<br>more people have an access to<br>electricity that is not clean or fewer<br>people have an access to electricity<br>because it's too expensive so you have<br>all these interdependences so the<br>question is do we want the disruption or<br>you want the transition to be disruptive<br>or you want it to be evolutionary<br>now the system is designed by engineers<br>is used by consumers and it's controlled<br>and it's mine perhaps one of my only<br>provocative thing I will say that may<br>get some people upset so it's my view to<br>say it's controlled by<br>regulation<br>so while the citizenry want this<br>disruption to be very very minimal we<br>don't want the lights to go off we want<br>it to be nice so we want to slow<br>evolutionary glide over to this<br>transition of clean energy and<br>low-carbon economy there are others<br>there who want it to be disruptive break<br>it up you know get rid of all these<br>monopolies get rid of all these things<br>that are standing in the way let's just<br>disrupt the whole system well if the<br>disruption affects the average<br>consumer he's not gonna be happy<br>so this transition is more driven by<br>technology if not it's driven by<br>technology but for the most part there<br>is a<br>political dimension and social dimension<br>and human dimension so when you ask you<br>to design the grid of the future I have<br>to ask myself who's the consumer what's<br>the fuel source and who's gonna control<br>it<br>because the Fitness is not a problem<br>again we can design any grid we want<br>given today's technology even tomorrow's<br>technology but the constraints around<br>being able to optimize the consumption I<br>talked about between these inner Wars<br>aqua Wars and info wars the constrains<br>around the objective function sorry my<br>only mathematical concept here is posed<br>by<br>policies regulation<br>societal needs society expectation and<br>that's our problem<br>so oftentimes when I travel around the<br>world people say they're doing it in New<br>Zealand why can't we do it in America or<br>we're doing it in America why can't you<br>do it in New Zealand<br>well we have to understand that although<br>this transition is global everyone is<br>talking about it everyone is thinking<br>about it everyone is concerned about<br>climate change these are global concepts<br>at the end of the day the implementation<br>has to be seen from a local context<br>because everything is local<br>everything is local so I'm not one of<br>those who love to solve I just stick for<br>one country and bring it to another<br>country and so you're saying like well<br>why don't everyone in Africa just<br>leapfrog to the next generation<br>technology well how are they going to<br>leapfrog if they don't have some of the<br>basic infrastructure to create leapfrog<br>and don't get me started with the<br>comparison of electricity and telecom as<br>though they're the same kind of product<br>because everyone will tell you well we<br>did it with telecom why not leave<br>probably electricity well they're not<br>the same different context so the<br>transition we're dealing with this is<br>very very localized although the<br>discussions around it might be global<br>so there are two shifts that are occur<br>the first shift is what I talked about<br>the political<br>the social the societal this less shows<br>you most of the countries in the world<br>that consume or will you release the<br>most co2 emissions the US China India<br>European Union Japan Korea Brazil if you<br>feel unhappy you want to put New Zealand<br>there feel three added to the list I<br>didn't want to offend you so I didn't<br>put it there because I don't think you<br>admit that much but I could be wrong but<br>in any case<br>what has happened over the last five<br>years<br>this lists their changing rules because<br>now the US has actually reduced its co2<br>emission over the last couple of years<br>in fact China has reduced its co2<br>emissions now let's look at India 320<br>million people in poverty and you're<br>telling India you should not use cold<br>okay<br>but from a political standpoint I have<br>320 million people who need to be fed<br>who need to live the same as you do in<br>New Zealand so what do they do in India<br>and the list goes on and on Japan<br>Fukushima shut down nuclear okay let's<br>go to using solar oh well no it's not<br>useful useful let's step back and let's<br>go back to nuclear<br>career we don't have a lot of resources<br>we have to import a lot of resources to<br>fuel our economies get to the Middle<br>East get to Africa so the first phase<br>shift is not so much of technology is<br>more of a political as a societal the<br>mindset has to change in terms of what<br>we're asking people to do with regards<br>to electricity so we have to shift and<br>the shift will bring about some of these<br>changes<br>then the second shift we should perhaps<br>the most difficult one is shifting how<br>we fuel our economies<br>coal is what we've used for decades and<br>according to the IEA will continue to<br>use coal<br>good or bad again if you look at a<br>five-year horizon<br>arising you may have a different<br>perspective but the fact that the matter<br>is if you're in a country that only has<br>coal and you have two hundred million<br>people who are poor<br>well you have to get him out of poverty<br>natural gas we have an abundance in<br>North America now thanks to something<br>that most people don't like which is<br>called fracking<br>well not all fracking is always bad and<br>I was interviewed in New Zealand a<br>couple of years ago and I was asked a<br>question and I see my old friend my good<br>friend Kevin Hart here he I was in in a<br>studio being interviewed by mr. Chris<br>Laidlaw and and we started interview<br>very nicely and Chris kind of pulled a<br>fast one on me because we're supposed to<br>talk about renewables and Chris said Oh<br>dr. Jones tell us what do you think of<br>fracking and I could see Kevin through<br>the window because we're working for the<br>but knowing how dumb I was I did answer<br>the question and and Chris didn't like<br>my answer because what I said to Chris<br>was I said well every time you try to<br>extract something for that from the<br>earth things can go wrong but sometimes<br>they don't go wrong at all and so when<br>we're done he looked at me and said<br>you're not an engineer more or less<br>you're a politician and I said you asked<br>me a political question so I gave you a<br>political answer because clearly asking<br>me what I think of fracking wasn't<br>supposed to be part of the conversation<br>but today because of you know hydraulic<br>fracking America has an abundance now<br>has there been a few incidents I don't<br>know has there been nothing maybe not<br>what I do know is that that technology<br>change has changed the dynamics of<br>energy in the United States<br>nuclear oh my god why should I use the<br>word nuclear in New Zealand<br>but I'm using it because China is<br>building 50 new nuclear power plants as<br>we speak<br>we want them to not use coal but if they<br>don't use coal and they have a billion<br>people to provide energy to what options<br>do they have<br>so again the choices the shift can just<br>happen in a vacuum because these things<br>have consequences<br>hydro Brazil Africa don't touch your<br>hydro resources because it's not good<br>for the environment okay fine I want to<br>have hydro what else am I supposed to do<br>I have a billion people who need<br>electricity should I not develop my<br>hydro<br>wind when is great try landing in<br>Wellington you realize how win is great<br>or even leaving Wellington because I've<br>been stuck there a couple of times can't<br>get out of the place because of the wind<br>when is great<br>subsidies for wind was great<br>but do you keep it perpetually do you<br>remove subsidy and let win fend for<br>itself like they've done in Denmark<br>solar<br>well as this thing that's supposed to<br>revolutionize the world and I was born<br>and grew up in West Africa and I must<br>tell you I believe that the Sun shines<br>quite a bit in West Africa but I can<br>also tell you that if you're gonna<br>industrialized West Africa no amount of<br>rooftop solar is gonna industrialize<br>West Africa so I have a problem if I use<br>on a solar and I'm supposed to build<br>factories in Africa to become<br>competitive with folks in New Zealand<br>how do I do it so none of these things<br>here are the panacea to our problem<br>we're going to need a<br>sort of a grouping a collection of<br>different solutions<br>but picking one and saying this is the<br>only thing in my view is a mistake and<br>trying to dictate to the world that this<br>is the one that we should all use it's<br>also a mistake so we can't play us all<br>our bets as we transition to a clean<br>energy economy on one we need a group of<br>multiple of these different things we<br>need a mixture we need a sort of a<br>diversity of solutions to be able to get<br>us where we want to get to<br>so what are some trends that will shape<br>given that the the supply makes me just<br>talked about what are some of the things<br>that are affecting how as I look into<br>the future and look at electricity<br>things that I think about<br>urbanization a very good thing perhaps<br>but explain to me from planet Mars why<br>are you people on this earth believe<br>it's best and is the most resilient<br>solution for all of you to live on the<br>coast for all your living these very<br>congested places called cities when God<br>has given you this vast land all over<br>the planet but for some reason we must<br>just all live in these very congested<br>places called cities not that it's bad I<br>know he kind of missed hate when I talk<br>about this because they say well cities<br>will drive the development because<br>economies of scale yeah I understand<br>that but cities also have a come a lot<br>of risk in fact one of the reasons why<br>these centralized solutions will not<br>work is because you have these huge<br>urban cities that cannot be supplied<br>electricity from decentralized sources<br>finding a rooftop solution in Paris in<br>Mumbai in Lagos but you're telling me I<br>should just decentralize okay I won't<br>decentralized but if I do how do I feel<br>these large mega uber<br>digitization hyper connectivity we're<br>living longer a great thing I'm so happy<br>my mom is gonna be hundred one of these<br>days I'll be so fantastically glad when<br>she turns 100 but not everyone will be<br>because some people realize that the<br>longer people live our economic system<br>wasn't designed for people to live long<br>sad to say but as a reality the<br>assumption around pension plans we're<br>that people will live until they reach a<br>certain age and then they will die well<br>guess what technology has extended the<br>lifespan of people so now the system is<br>in shock because before the amount of<br>consumers were supposed to stop at a<br>certain point well they're now extending<br>their crossing over so the more people<br>are consuming is because few people are<br>dying compared to what we had expected<br>which is a great thing but that poses a<br>challenge we've already talked about<br>consumption and by the way we're gonna<br>have infinite resource perhaps someone<br>who say the Sun is the most infinite<br>resource we have and I don't disagree<br>but how do you harness it in a way that<br>will bring about the developments we've<br>talked about global governance structure<br>why does that affect electricity systems<br>well you realize that like I already<br>said it's not the technology that drives<br>how will design electricity systems how<br>we run them is oftentimes constrained by<br>the political realities and within which<br>we operate and then I call this cyber<br>insecurity because everybody talks about<br>cybersecurity I prefer cyber insecurity<br>because we're all cyber insecure how<br>many people you have a cell phone right<br>now that is on<br>great so you all have just been hacked<br>by my question because the reality is<br>we're insecure<br>hyper connectivity is great but with<br>that comes a lot of risk and until we<br>learn how to harness that risk we are<br>we're gonna be insecure so<br>centralization has a lot of benefits<br>urbanization smart cities that's why we<br>centralize<br>data platforms Google Facebook those are<br>centralized platforms no one complain<br>about it<br>open innovation great when you<br>centralize things we can share<br>information<br>central banks it's a centralized thing<br>by the nature of the name central bank<br>we need central bank's because without<br>central bank's we cannot avoid some of<br>these economic catastrophes if you're<br>gonna scale up renewables and really<br>scale it up<br>you need centralized power plants large<br>solar plants large wind plants but<br>they're gonna have to be centralized in<br>large if you're gonna really have an<br>impact and industrialization you can't<br>industrialize a country with<br>decentralized solutions imagine 50 years<br>ago if New Zealand didn't build a single<br>centralized power station if everybody<br>had their own rooftop solar I<br>can guarantee you you will not be where<br>you are today with your GDP<br>because you need scale you need<br>centralization but you also need the<br>centralization<br>because centralized systems have an<br>intrinsic property of being not<br>oftentimes resilient ick it out the rest<br>of the system is out so decentralization<br>is great because it adds some resilience<br>it gives some independence it helps<br>innovation because if everything is<br>centralized somehow it's not estai meets<br>innovation sometimes it's good to be the<br>point the wonky guy sitting in the place<br>by yourself thinking and not talking to<br>a bunch of other people it's not a bad<br>thing it reduces system failures but in<br>the context of electrification<br>decentralization is very important<br>because we have about a billion people<br>in the world who live in rural<br>communities who need access to<br>electricity and we shouldn't make the<br>mistake and force them to live in urban<br>communities because that will only<br>exacerbate the problem we should find a<br>way to make what I call D urbanization<br>work to centralize decentralization it<br>should be okay to live in the rural<br>communities one thing I like up in New<br>Zealand whenever I come here most people<br>I know who live in the city it take a<br>boat to go somewhere live in another<br>little village even though you know<br>Wellington is still getting congested I<br>was walking there yesterday I'm like oh<br>my god I can't find my way around this<br>place I never did in the first place but<br>it's even getting worse now when I when<br>I go there so decentralization is not a<br>bad thing so we were now entering this<br>new age I call it the age of hybridity<br>again not a word it was never a word<br>until I used it so you notice that<br>Lawrence creates words because that's<br>how we innovate we come up with concepts<br>and let those concepts become sort of a<br>the foundation for going forward so<br>there's notion of hybridity hybrid<br>systems what will have both centralized<br>and decentralized<br>that's where I think we're going but the<br>challenge is that the political reality<br>within which these systems must work are<br>not moving along with the same change<br>because think about a hybrid government<br>right most governments are the<br>centralized or quasi centralized but now<br>you're telling them to be hybrid what<br>the heck does a hybrid government do<br>well I can give you one example a hybrid<br>government could be a government where<br>you put a ministry in every city not in<br>the big city so you have maybe the<br>Minister of Finance in Auckland you have<br>the Minister of Energy in Wellington you<br>have one in Hamilton<br>decentralized it's still a centralized<br>government why you can do that is<br>because of hyper-connectivity there's no<br>need to have all the ministries in the<br>same city there's absolutely no need you<br>can pretty much in the next decade you<br>can beam yourself into a city and have a<br>conversation you can use virtual reality<br>and have a meeting so why do we still<br>need all these centralized government<br>structures so we're asking politicians<br>we together to create a new reality a<br>hybrid regulatory system a hybrid<br>political system that will allow us to<br>deal with both centralized and<br>decentralized solutions there is no one<br>size fit all and I say this because<br>mixing politics regulation and economics<br>with the laws of physics and I didn't<br>actually put all these physicists<br>because I like to put them in so it<br>makes me look smart<br>Kirchhoff Voltaire unpair more math<br>class these are physicists you take<br>their theories and combine them with<br>policy regulation and economic theory<br>sometimes you end up with chaos<br>because when you try to make physics box<br>physics into these regulatory policy on<br>economic theories and they don't work<br>what you do you force engineers to make<br>things work to make politicians<br>economists or lawyers happy I have a<br>joke where I was saved take me and put<br>me in a room a bunch of lawyers and I<br>give them one sentence and say this is<br>the sentence to regulate or this is the<br>sentence of a ha I'm going to operate a<br>power system when they come back they<br>would have given me 500 more sentences<br>for that one sentence I'm a little<br>exaggerating but you have the point so<br>we need to be careful when we take a<br>physical system like the electricity<br>grid well we have transition occurring<br>on the supply side of the generation on<br>the consumption side and then we say let<br>it work within this political framework<br>and so you force engineers to do<br>something with a system that wasn't<br>designed to do these things to support<br>the economic theory or the political<br>theory or the legal framework and that<br>is one of the challenges we have would<br>have caused electricity<br>is that we're being asked to do a lot of<br>things with electricity that physics<br>cannot just be defied and we've seen<br>examples around the world where when<br>these things don't match well sometimes<br>they do work well I must admit you've<br>gotten them right in New Zealand at<br>times but again like every one of us<br>you've gotten it wrong at times too so<br>you can mix the three and the other<br>thing and you my friend whose own<br>electricity market designer we try to<br>design markets for a commodity that is<br>not a normal commodity<br>electricity is not like water I cannot<br>sell you one glass of electricity I<br>could but I will be fooling you I<br>can't so if I'm trying to create market<br>for something that's not a real<br>commodity I can't even store it today so<br>if I can't store it well the economic<br>theory become a little bit tricky<br>so electricity is the peculiar commodity<br>you<br>know and the thing about it is it's only<br>valuable when it's not there so when the<br>lights are off everybody would do<br>everything to pay to have the lights<br>come back on and once it comes back on<br>the price must go down now it's weird<br>because if you asked everybody in this<br>room what's the most important commodity<br>they need every day when they get home<br>it's light it's electricity its power<br>but then you are told that it should be<br>affordable so you prefer to spend a<br>thousand dollars on your cell phone bill<br>but you won't want to pay a dollar for<br>electricity<br>that's strange but that's the reality<br>and that's the challenge facing the<br>electricity sector is that we have a<br>commodity that is only value but when<br>it's not there and in fact when it's not<br>there we're blamed we say it's your<br>guy's fault you know the the the<br>regulatory framework the political<br>framework whatever tells us make this<br>system work a certain way do this do<br>that and when things go wrong it's still<br>your fault even though I told you to do<br>it so you create electricity markets but<br>in fact electricity is not a normal<br>commodity<br>so how do you design a system<br>for the future for something that is not<br>a real commodity<br>let's talk briefly about investments as<br>much as electricity is so important do<br>you know that in the great United States<br>of America there was a study some time<br>ago that showed that there was more<br>then in energy<br>think about it so we the collectively<br>because I can ask the same question how<br>much does New Zealand invest in energy<br>R&amp;D<br>not much I would guess because globally<br>is less than 2% this is the most<br>important thing we need to fix the world<br>to feel the world to end poverty and<br>we're only invest in 2% of whatever is<br>in it now you can blame anybody you can<br>blame the government you can blame the<br>private sector the fact of the matter is<br>if this thing is so important why we're<br>not investing in it<br>my fear is we as engineers are very dumb<br>what we've done is we've designed<br>something so robust that provides so<br>much so great reality reliability<br>99.99999<br>that to tell you that we need more money<br>to make it another nine better<br>no doesn't make sense so we're stuck<br>there's so much that we need to do with<br>the electricity system there's so much<br>innovation that needs to occur but<br>nobody believes us because the lights<br>are on all the time and if the lights to<br>so the innovation that we see coming<br>that will shape the consumption patterns<br>that will shape how we design systems<br>that will shape the generation the<br>supply-side<br>material science<br>sensors everything a sense today this<br>whole hyper connectivity is driven by<br>everything being sense everything is<br>being controlled I mean you fly the<br>Boeing or Airbus airplane and you<br>realize how things have I mean<br>everything is just great everything is<br>controlled in fact what realize we<br>ourselves were controlled you know<br>because you have a cellphone which means<br>everywhere you go I can track you you<br>have a TV that's supposed to be smart TV<br>you don't realize that in that TV is a<br>chip that's telling me when you went to<br>sleep I<br>didn't tell you that but anyway<br>artificial intelligence we're getting to<br>the place where<br>Siri in Google and they're equivalent<br>he's sort of a assistant that will tell<br>you where you're going you're sick<br>Loren's you have 50 minutes left to talk<br>you have all these intelligent<br>artificial intelligence stuff that is<br>really gaining momentum that's gonna<br>really change how we live<br>computational science now we can test<br>and retest an experiment using<br>simulation in ways we could have never<br>imagined all of this bodes well for how<br>we design energy systems all of this<br>bodes well for how we do manufacturing<br>we'll start looking at things like 3d<br>printing all of this will bring about<br>change but interestingly enough all of<br>these things also require energy in fact<br>computational signs the faster we<br>compute the more power we need to<br>compute even faster and faster and<br>faster<br>but innovation has to occur and so the<br>hyper connectivity is a topic that is on<br>everyone's mind as we look at innovation<br>there is a chart that's a little bit<br>confused this graph a little bit<br>confusing here because what it is is we<br>had a session at AI a few years ago<br>where we brought executives in a room<br>and said let's talk about connectivity<br>and these are some of the words that<br>came up as we discuss connectivity how<br>we're so connected and I think<br>connectivity it's a good thing when we<br>think about electricity but it's also a<br>good thing when we think about how we<br>solve the problems that we're facing in<br>the world this sort of a just a sort of<br>executive thoughts on how we discuss and<br>talk about the connectivity<br>so the other thing about this equation<br>the equation of generation<br>supply let's forget about the grid for a<br>moment<br>brings us to the supply side when it<br>comes to deal with the consumer<br>we've gone from this notion that we had<br>only three types of consumers commercial<br>residential and industrial that's how<br>we're classified but now because of<br>innovation because of connectivity<br>because of wireless connectivity because<br>of all kinds of things we're now<br>entering the age where everything is<br>individualized<br>and that's one of the reasons why<br>everybody wants their own rooftop PV<br>because everyone is thinking I can stand<br>on my own two feet<br>but the day the Sun doesn't shine I want<br>the utility to be there<br>and by the way even if I were to buy an<br>energy storage I'll still need to charge<br>that storage device to make it available<br>so somehow I still need my grid so you<br>have all these new types of customer<br>services<br>emerging because sometimes we look at<br>what's happening on the telecoms side<br>and say why can't we do the same thing<br>on the electricity side and so you have<br>all these needs for these different<br>services but I go back I cannot sell you<br>a glass of electricity<br>so what am I supposed to commoditize<br>what am I supposed to personalise for<br>you the consumer well if I'm a<br>electricity company that I'm selling<br>electricity and I can't come monetize<br>this and you're telling me you want<br>services then I have to come up with<br>services well if I did come up with<br>services those services have to be legal<br>within the framework of how the system<br>works so the policymakers and regulators<br>we have to tell me Loren's you can now<br>not only sell electricity you have to<br>offer certain services so my business<br>model will have to change I would have<br>to come with a whole new way of offering<br>these services and monetizing these<br>services to meet your demands energies<br>management system in home building<br>management systems all of these things<br>will mean different kinds of services so<br>I'm moving from selling kilowatt hour to<br>selling kilowatt hour enable services<br>but I'm not allowed to do it today<br>because that's not how the legal<br>framework is set up so I'm gonna have to<br>change that<br>to be able to offer these services<br>transportation electrification<br>perhaps one of the hottest topics in the<br>industry today for many reasons whether<br>it's in China in Canada and parts of the<br>US in Europe the electrification of<br>Transportation is gaining momentum<br>price of batteries continue to go down<br>and most people see this as one way to<br>address the emissions issues is by<br>electrifying transportation which is<br>great but yours again go back to the<br>beginning of one of my slides where do I<br>get the electricity from<br>do I get it from coal do I get it from<br>nuclear can I charge my car using my<br>rooftop PV<br>but do I need to go and charge somewhere<br>else so this is great I think it's gonna<br>happen I think it's coming it's gonna be<br>a major trend it's gonna break from<br>being just a trend to be an actual<br>status quo in the next 5 10 15 years but<br>we have to think about how do we feel<br>these cars<br>so it's a trade-off I can have less<br>carbon emissions co2 emissions from cars<br>but then I can allow a little bit more<br>from by power plants but I can't do both<br>right if I'm not gonna use gasoline to<br>feel my car I'm gonna have to use<br>electricity if I'm gonna use electricity<br>I can't just rely on renewables because<br>I need to have enough to do all of this<br>stuff<br>energy storage the other night next<br>topic that everyone is talking about and<br>when you talk to people what I like<br>about talking to people who are not<br>entrenched in all the policy and<br>technical issues of our electricity then<br>we'll hear on the news energy storage is<br>great we can do it and then they'll tell<br>you I have this friend who always said<br>to me Lawrence why we can't do this and<br>like can we do that yeah what are you<br>here from I heard on the radio so we<br>hear these things and we actually<br>believe it to be true because if the<br>engineers tell you they might not be<br>telling you the truth right so you don't<br>believe the engineer who actually knows<br>what he's telling you I said something<br>the other day I said doctors<br>very great doctors you tell if he tells<br>you you're sick you never ask the doctor<br>why I'm sick you just say make me cure<br>peel me quickly when an engineer tells<br>you you have a problem you tell them why<br>do I have a problem<br>it's a problem because I know more than<br>you do because this is my feel of<br>specialty right so energy storage yes if<br>it will happen are we there yet no will<br>it take time yes does it require more<br>R&amp;D it sho does but what would that mean<br>for the grid and by the way energy<br>storage it's not just what happens in<br>your home if you had have a little<br>storage device in your home this thing<br>called electricity<br>everyone here who uses a hairdryer<br>tomorrow morning should realize that if<br>the machine the motor doesn't turn it's<br>probably cause you have a problem<br>because you don't have enough pressure<br>portal quota we call it voltage on a<br>your doctor set aside that's pushing up<br>the system to give you enough pressure<br>to turn that hairdryer right now many<br>people don't realize that when you pay<br>for electricity you oftentimes pay for<br>so-called energy but you don't pay for<br>this energy that's called reactive<br>energy which is the set of energy<br>producers pressure you only pay for what<br>it's called good energy or what is<br>called megawatt hour so in essence the<br>engineers the engineers have designed a<br>system where the thing that is most<br>valuable for your hairdryer you're not<br>paying for it<br>you need voltage to make sure you dry<br>your hair in the morning if there's<br>anything you should remember from this<br>conversation is tell your friend your<br>husband your spouse if my hairdryer<br>isn't working is because you haven't<br>paid for the voltage to the you turn<br>your utility but you do have storage for<br>reactive power they're called capacitor<br>banks these things that store reactive<br>power but guess what we don't monetize<br>it today because to do that oh my<br>goodness is going to be too complicated<br>to design a monetary system where people<br>pay for reactive power so we don't today<br>which is a mistake we should<br>we don't so any good stories is not just<br>here it's along the entire value chain<br>so we see a taking off in the u.s. we<br>see it taking off here<br>I want to just get to a few slides<br>before we take some questions yeah this<br>issue of modernizing the grid we need<br>the grid we've talked about generation<br>we've talked about the supply side but<br>you have to connect those two even if<br>you had a micro grid that micro grid<br>needs to have a couple of wires to<br>connect your home to the micro grid so<br>you can't get away from infrastructure<br>and<br>the paradigm here with these blocks if<br>you may or nah what we see as the<br>building blocks for how you design and<br>modernize electricity systems in a way<br>that will deal with the regulation the<br>policy the economics the cybersecurity<br>the customers the visibility that is<br>needed to keep the lights on how you<br>operate these systems and as we think<br>about designing systems we can no longer<br>take a singular view to the problem<br>where we want to look at the policy we<br>need to take a holistic view of it which<br>means how we plan future electricity<br>systems we'll have to look at the<br>pricing model why are we not pricing<br>electricity reactive power tomorrow do<br>me a favor call your utility and ask<br>them tell them I would like to pay for<br>reactive power and if they ask you why I<br>tell them because if I did I will be<br>guaranteed I would have more pressure I<br>will have more voltages to put my head<br>right<br>okay<br>do that<br>okay interoperability make sure that<br>when you talk to your utility or when<br>you talk to your policymaker that all<br>these systems can communicate they can<br>interoperate because if they don't we<br>are entering a world where cyber<br>security can creep up and affect us in<br>different ways if we don't think about<br>how you protect interoperable systems<br>so we've talked about this transition<br>we've talked about how you go about<br>dealing with the economics of it looking<br>at the situation where new business<br>models we evolve the customers<br>expectations<br>everybody wants clean energy but not<br>realizing that perhaps energy-wise it<br>may be good in the local context in one<br>country may not make sense in another<br>country just because of the practical<br>reality how do you achieve resilience so<br>you need to sort of a think holistically<br>about this transition and what it means<br>and that brings me to the last point<br>which is value<br>oftentimes when we talk about<br>electricity we always talk about the<br>price<br>the costs<br>very seldom do we talk about the value<br>remise said we have the most important<br>commodity that is only valuable when<br>it's not there<br>so now as we talk about this transition<br>we're facing a situation where<br>whether it's evolutionary or disruptive<br>value is going to somehow be impacted<br>and<br>the question is how do we make sure that<br>the value of the grid the value of<br>having an infrastructure that connects<br>consumers to suppliers that value is not<br>destroyed when we go about this<br>transition<br>so we don't want to destroy the value we<br>want to create new value but creating<br>new value is tricky because it means<br>someone is gonna have to lose and<br>someone's gonna have to win or we can<br>play in the sandbox together some people<br>win some some people win a little bit<br>more but no one loses completely and<br>that's our challenge<br>so the last thing there about technology<br>we should relates to this thing of value<br>is the Internet of Things<br>again one of those things that started<br>in another industry everyone hears about<br>it is great let's have the Internet of<br>Things for the power grid<br>it brings all these benefits<br>observability controllability<br>collectability flexibility all sounds<br>great but how do you make it work in<br>reality when you connect these different<br>devices for example I was talking about<br>it yesterday how do you monetize the<br>actions do it that is carried out by<br>these different devices so<br>there a couple of examples it's<br>happening in in the u.s. in California<br>they're not talking about the grid of<br>things<br>connectivity is there it doesn't have to<br>be called the Internet of Things where<br>every little home device is gonna be<br>connected to one another we're in it<br>we've already had a grid of things we've<br>already had interconnectivity this is<br>nothing new<br>so PG&amp;E has this lab where they're<br>looking at putting things together your<br>neighbor Australia they're experimenting<br>with this to where they're looking at<br>you know the idea of Internet of Things<br>connecting different homes and allowing<br>these home suits to sort of a tap into<br>the market and and be part of this<br>ecosystem lighting systems today can be<br>part of this Internet of Things<br>transportation system all of these<br>things coming together creates value the<br>question is<br>how do you share the value along the<br>value chain in the past you had one<br>company that supply your electricity you<br>still have the same demand now you want<br>50 companies so I just asked a simple<br>math does it make sense I'm not saying<br>it's right or wrong but just look at the<br>equation if you still want one amp air<br>in your home and not answer get me from<br>one person you getting it from 50 people<br>someone is losing money somewhere and<br>guess who most likely is you<br>so our gone energy they're doing some<br>stuff they're in Australia this idea of<br>smart function smart homes this is the<br>one I like you know because people see<br>smart homes you know and I come back to<br>my mom she's almost well I can say it's<br>fine she's almost 80 so she'll not be<br>mad at me saying she's 80 when you turn<br>it but when you turn 80 you're very<br>proud because you've lived such a good<br>life right so you say you in if I said<br>to her mom she was 40 when she was 14<br>she would get mad at me but when she's<br>80 she's just happy to be 80<br>but people said my mom needs a smart<br>home and she's like no I just want the<br>nice to come on when I want it on I<br>don't need all these gadgets I want it<br>simple convenient I don't want all this<br>stuff so what has happened is because of<br>few people a few smart savvy people many<br>of us in this room we lag all this<br>technologists stuff we then are the ones<br>who want to drive the rest of the<br>consumers to be to think monied smart<br>home when in fact they don't so then you<br>asked me to design a system that will<br>all a benefit 10% of the people<br>but the remaining all the people you who<br>are over 60 and 70 and 80 I want to ask<br>you to raise your hands but but all<br>those people who don't need those<br>sophisticated systems they'll still pay<br>for it<br>so how is that fair that I'm going to<br>design a system that will only benefit<br>10% of the consumers but everyone else<br>has to pay so that thing about grid<br>pricing the structure of the pricing how<br>we price electricity and the services<br>that has to change so ladies and<br>gentlemen the choices we're gonna make<br>will have consequences for not just a<br>value chain and how value is created<br>along the grid those 5 10 15 years<br>the choices we make today will shape<br>what happens<br>so there are trade-offs are gonna have<br>to make if we're gonna reach and I say a<br>near zero carb on the world because<br>we're never gonna get to 100% carbon<br>neutral world it's impossible I don't<br>think it's feasible in our lifetime not<br>in my lifetime not in my children's<br>lifetime not even in my grandchildren's<br>lifetime so let's just accept it that<br>we're never gonna get to a hundred<br>percent zero carbon world I'm sure there<br>are people you who disagree with me and<br>tomorrow the newspaper bastard will say<br>dr. Lawrence you'll say we'll never get<br>to zero carbon world if you can tell me<br>how it works how is gonna make sense<br>financially<br>societal from a societal standpoint I<br>would agree with you but I just don't<br>see how it's gonna happen we can get to<br>a near zero<br>but to get to ultimate zero that's not<br>possible<br>because we have to make choices and the<br>biggest thing behind that making it work<br>is the lack of trust<br>because we don't trust each other we<br>don't trust each other in families who<br>don't trust each other in countries we<br>don't trust each other in the world we<br>lack trust and until we can fix the<br>trust factor to realize that it's OK for<br>India to use coal<br>together people out of poverty and it's<br>okay for us in New Zealand to have an<br>electricity bill go up a little bit so<br>we can use some of that money to support<br>research that will benefit people in<br>Indian Africa or the people in Indian<br>Africa should leapfrog to clean<br>technology we have to trust that until<br>we do this together collectively as a<br>world we're not gonna solve this problem<br>so in fact you can shut down all the<br>coal-fired plants in the country and buy<br>all the solar technology from China<br>manufactured with coal fire plants<br>and what you would have done nothing to<br>the ecosystem because guess what is one<br>world and what goes in has to come out<br>so at the end of the day we have to fix<br>the trust factor so I'll end with this<br>quote from Thomas Edison<br>that vision without execution is nothing<br>but hallucination we were very great as<br>a world as a people to have vision all<br>kinds of visions I've read some in a<br>vision statements I'm done I'm losing my<br>head now but the execution is lacking<br>and so we did pass a we had a Paris<br>agreement everybody signed it at least<br>most people did who were there the<br>question is how do we execute because if<br>we don't again we'll still be dreaming<br>thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
