a<br>low-carbon city and so that's what I'm<br>going to do and I just want to relate<br>that to a sustainable city because each<br>one of us they'll have an idea what<br>sustainability is but for me is a<br>sustainable city is one that takes an<br>informed and intelligent<br>long-term collaborative approach to<br>economic social and environmental<br>challenges and I'm not going to argue<br>climate change because as various it is<br>always to do percent they say is in the<br>audience so I just accept climate change<br>and I'll accept the challenge that and<br>we need to reduce carbon emissions now<br>our research of the energy center has<br>has shown that we can meet our<br>obligations our national target of<br>ninety percent and power from renewable<br>sources of electricity by 2025 so that's<br>quite doable other countries that I've<br>been working with those struggling to<br>reach ten or twenty percent so we're<br>doing okay in that and that respect<br>however when it comes to reducing co2<br>emissions<br>agriculture and transport remain our<br>biggest challenge and agriculture does<br>not feature in the autumn be follow me<br>majorly so I'm going to push that to the<br>side and then any of them fear no<br>solutions on the horizon to the<br>greenhouse gas emissions that come from<br>agriculture but Auckland faces major<br>challenges and I've got 10 minutes to to<br>focus on some of these and I'm gonna<br>focus on transport as others have any<br>link transfer board with urban design<br>and economic throughout so what steps<br>can often take what precedes can often<br>council take what steps can often<br>business for-profit nonprofit and the<br>community take to address the transport<br>challenge you have counselor to me and a<br>very simple level two major instrument<br>second that can use our human planning<br>little design and a can invest in<br>infrastructure so those are the tools<br>the two major tools that I've has now<br>urban planning a significant<br>intensification is proposed by the<br>unitary plan whether you agree with that<br>or not its benefits so we could imagine<br>greater use of public transport we could<br>associate what that might be lower co2<br>emissions and the saving and<br>transportation costs so those that might<br>be some of the benefits the local<br>economy might benefit from the global<br>agglomeration benefits so businesses<br>working closely together and the<br>community itself i think as rivers<br>Illustrated you can derive nearest<br>social benefits from a sense of place<br>but there are no free lunches in a world<br>of scarcity and we need to be aware of<br>impacts of intensification on our<br>natural capital that the come the place<br>that we have that we call that we call<br>them so for example<br>biodiversity has been found to decrease<br>as a percentage of impervious area<br>increases in the city now furthermore in<br>association with it urban growth and<br>Michael mentioned the abuse that we<br>visited upon thee to harbor earlier we<br>find elevated concentrations of lead of<br>zinc and copper and cores taken from<br>Inner Harbor and these are the legacies<br>that we have to deal with going forward<br>now lower water quality here into the<br>of our ecosystems now careful urban<br>design here can such a human right pier<br>in plunging and green spaces can reduce<br>the adverse effects of intensification<br>turning to economic growth I see<br>economic growth as being essential for<br>achieving a sustainable City<br>Alton accounts for about thirty percent<br>of Earth New Zealand CDP and it is<br>dominated by the services sector going<br>forward or pence contribution is not<br>going to change in fact it's likely to<br>increase with the the growth is<br>projected for all T so this underpins I<br>think the importance of profitable<br>business for sustainable growth<br>with the digital economy here we will<br>see new business models emerge new<br>business models based on low transaction<br>costs low correlation costs and improved<br>productivity<br>future-proofing urban development and<br>planning that supports innovation and<br>growth will contribute to both emission<br>reductions and to profitable business<br>now turning to investment and<br>for a really good example a recent<br>example I think has been the benefits of<br>rail electrification and Oakland it has<br>reduced co2 emissions by eighty-two<br>percent<br>over a period when ridership has<br>increased so that's one of the benefits<br>associated with investment now<br>investment and transport infrastructure<br>will surely lower congestion levels from<br>time but what the data show is that<br>eventually as the city grows congestion<br>will again increase<br>so we're going to be dealing with it<br>again in 10 or 20 years time but what<br>about the notion of a smart city and<br>some of you might be aware of<br>Singapore's plan to have a fully<br>automated electric vehicles in the city<br>by 23 so fossil fuel in car burning cars<br>are going to be gone and so you'll be<br>getting into our literature vehicle and<br>tell it where you want to go it'll take<br>you there so this list let me just offer<br>a few thoughts about a smart city smart<br>buildings for an example here the work<br>that we've done with Genesis Energy<br>shows that households can reduce their<br>electricity consumption by around<br>eighteen percent by using smart<br>technology and the household so that's a<br>demand-side innovation that contributes<br>to the reduction of co2 emissions<br>turning to solar we're completing a<br>study of solar potential and<br>collaboration with autumn group and<br>council and as was mentioned earlier I<br>think Rob mentioned that if the council<br>is a target of empowering hundred and<br>seventy thousand albums by solar now<br>Solar brings a potential of reducing<br>energy consumption from households but<br>achieving this target is going to<br>require collaboration<br>with the energy sector and particularly<br>the lines companies in order to achieve<br>these targets so this is an example of<br>supply-side innovation that can<br>contribute to lower co2 emissions so I<br>see both counsel and business playing a<br>role in the development of a low-carbon<br>city<br>now tuned in to local elections and one<br>day one engine to politics here but<br>local elections are eminent and we're<br>moving into an area and into an era of<br>the industry plan and also the legacy<br>associated with earlier councils and I<br>want to highlight the concern that I<br>here with democracy at the local level<br>here vota tuned out and the general<br>election is around sixty to seventy<br>percent of eligible voters so that's the<br>the general election now tuning to the<br>local election the turnout here is<br>fallen from fifty percent down to thirty<br>six percent and<br>2013 so thirty-six percent of our<br>eligible voters at local elections as<br>national here model of them he had<br>turned out to vote and importantly I<br>think only thirty-three percent of those<br>in the 18 to 25 ace group fight<br>now by way of contrast as you have up<br>it go up with ages here okay you find<br>that seventy eighty percent of the<br>people in their 50s 60s and 70s do have<br>to vote so the question that I have is<br>that why has voter turnout and local<br>elections to client and are eligible<br>voters connected in any way with the<br>outcomes of council policy and plans and<br>does council know for example what is<br>important to our younger cohort because<br>these are the people that are going to<br>inherit the decisions that we're making<br>today<br>so to follow on that that line of<br>thought the digital age creates an<br>opportunity for smart<br>smart governance through the use of<br>technology digital technology and agency<br>community to participate and policy that<br>is guided by data that is captured by<br>smart technology and so in order to<br>achieve the outcomes of a sustainable<br>City Council will need to know its<br>community and the concerns better and<br>maybe that will lift their participation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
