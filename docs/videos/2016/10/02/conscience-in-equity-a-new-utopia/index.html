own findings and<br>judgments<br>but indeed I'm going to talk about<br>see a book which is<br>going but in that book more identifies<br>this perfect community a<br>community where more is incredibly<br>a lot of legal discourse and references<br>to the language of equity and justice<br>and fairness<br>services<br>century I don't make conscious I'm<br>standing in New Zealand as an English<br>lawyer but actually talking about equity<br>here is<br>equity is important<br>you have developed equity in your own<br>image to some extent there's an awful<br>lot of the language and the ideas and<br>and obviously the focus is on cultures<br>because when I teach equity to my<br>students back in Cambridge I say<br>conscience is<br>a language of conscience and<br>unconscionability that's the sort of<br>thing we say Mendeley<br>textbook there are many judgments which<br>say<br>do we actually<br>by<br>nobility<br>in the course of<br>I am going to be<br>slightly<br>too<br>this quotation which gives me a bit of<br>party what I'm about to say he said you<br>are not obliged to assault people with<br>discourses that are out of their Road<br>when you see that there receive notions<br>must prevent your making an impression<br>upon them you ought rather to cast about<br>and to manage things with all the<br>dexterity in your power so that if you<br>are not able to make them go well they<br>may be as little ill as possible so if<br>this doesn't go well I hope there is as<br>little ill as possible arising from what<br>I'm going to say now what is the nature<br>of the problem the language of<br>conscience and<br>unconscionability is used a great deal<br>both in England and you can find it in<br>New Zealand cases as well as I said<br>earlier what exactly does conscience<br>mean<br>now my thoughts relating to this and<br>that this is a problem that requires<br>careful consideration<br>was prompted by two decisions of the UK<br>Supreme Court in<br>2013<br>given within two weeks of each other<br>when the language of conscience and<br>unconscionability was used but was<br>interpreted completely differently now<br>the first case is pit and halt the facts<br>of which don't matter for today but it<br>was a case about a settlement on trust<br>which the set law sought to challenge<br>and set aside on the ground of mistake<br>essentially she had been advised to set<br>up the trust in a particular way to<br>avoid a significant tax liability the<br>legal advice was not very good and<br>actually was set up in a way to incur a<br>particular tax liability and she sought<br>to get the settlement set aside to avoid<br>the tax liability and actually the<br>Supreme Court allowed that settlement to<br>be set aside but in that case Lord<br>Walker set an important test of the<br>equitable jurisdiction<br>to set aside for mistake is whether not<br>setting it aside would result in an<br>awful word to use but would not result<br>in<br>unconscionable nurse that was the<br>standard and he said the standard of<br>unconscionable nasaan objective standard<br>and to determine it you have regard to<br>the circumstances of the mistake the<br>consequences change of position and<br>other met matters relevant to the<br>exercise of the courts and I should say<br>there is a typo in that slide and it<br>should say the courts discretion that's<br>going to prove important a little bit<br>later so the test for the jurisdiction<br>to set aside was one of unconscionable<br>Nuss objectively defined two weeks later<br>in a case which made no reference to pit<br>and halt maybe because the facts were<br>significantly different lord Neuberger<br>used the language of conscience to<br>establish a liability but interpreted it<br>very differently this was the<br>Vestergaard case a case which was about<br>access or real liability for breach of<br>confidence the breach of confidence<br>related to trade secrets relating to a<br>mosquito net which had got a protic<br>killer drug put into the netting to keep<br>the mosquitoes away the question of<br>liability<br>related to somebody who had arguably<br>assisted the breach of confidence and it<br>was held she would only be liable if she<br>acted unconscionably but here<br>unconscionable was interpreted<br>subjectively with a focus on the<br>defendants state of mind and with<br>particular<br>regards to issues of knowledge willful<br>blindness recklessness and dishonesty<br>two cases of the Supreme Court within a<br>fortnight using the language of<br>conscience and unconscionability but<br>interpreted very differently<br>Pitt and Holt objective Vestergaard a<br>subjective test of fault so what on<br>earth is going on can we really use the<br>same words and interpret them so<br>differently<br>now let's just focus briefly on the<br>language of conscience and<br>unconscionability this is largely a<br>ground clearing exercise just so you all<br>with me about the basic language my view<br>is that we can actually use conscience<br>and unconscionability<br>interchangeably in the sense that they<br>are different sides of the same coin my<br>view is that unconscionability means<br>contrary to good conscience that's the<br>negative and good conscience the<br>positive in the cases and the<br>commentaries you'll find many synonyms<br>for unconscionability it's bad faith or<br>equitable fraud or injustice unfairness<br>dishonesty and commercially unacceptable<br>conduct they are used both in New<br>Zealand and in England as sinner<br>for the language of unconscionability<br>and the real question is when we use<br>that word<br>unconscionable should it refer does it<br>refer to a state of mind a normative<br>standard for evaluating conduct is it a<br>test of morality a sense of guilt or all<br>of those things<br>now I'm going to investigate that in a<br>minute but I just want to say two things<br>before I go any further first is just to<br>establish that in New Zealand the<br>language of unconscionability has been<br>interpreted you'll see then the judgment<br>of justice summers in the Elders case as<br>say he said that words such as<br>unconscionable and inequitable have<br>drawn closer to more objective concepts<br>such as fair reasonable and just that's<br>one of those<br>dictums that you could spend a long time<br>unpacking<br>drawing closer to more objective<br>concepts suggesting perhaps it is a<br>subjective concept that is starting to<br>be expanded to become objective<br>but one other useful thing<br>recently I was reading a book called the<br>bramble bush by Karl Llewellyn some of<br>you will know this book<br>Karl Fluellen was a professor in the<br>States who at the University of Columbia<br>gave<br>first-year lectures<br>they obviously rather tough lectures I<br>think having read this book because the<br>bramble bush is a<br>basically a publication consisting of<br>those introductory lectures and<br>apparently this book is still referred<br>to in some US law schools to be read by<br>first-year law students but in that book<br>Fluellen said the following he wasn't<br>talking about unconscionability as such<br>but I didn't it actually identifies the<br>problem with which I'm concerned he said<br>legal use of technical words has sinned<br>and does still in two respects it is<br>involved in ambiguity of two kinds<br>multiple senses of the same terms and<br>terms too broad to be precise in<br>application to details of single<br>disputes first it does not use terms in<br>single senses but uses the same term in<br>several senses and in several senses<br>indiscriminately without awareness this<br>invites confusion it makes bad logic<br>almost inevitable it makes statement of<br>clear thought difficult it makes clear<br>thought itself improbable and as lawyers<br>surely clear thought is what we should<br>be seeking to encourage in others and in<br>ourself and I got a really good summary<br>of the problems relating to the failure<br>to unpack what we mean by conscience and<br>unconscionability now at this point I<br>think it is quite useful to give you a<br>very brief history of conscience in<br>equity and this is where some of you are<br>going to be squirming in your seats<br>because this is a gross<br>generalization of a complex historical<br>development development of the law but<br>actually I stand by this brief history I<br>think this does in general terms<br>indicate how conscience has developed<br>over time as an equitable notion you can<br>trace the language of conscience back to<br>the Chancellor's conscience the Lord<br>Chancellor who received petitions from<br>citizens in England and Wales who said<br>we weren't happy with what the common<br>law said we want justice and we want the<br>Lord Chancellor to provide justice in<br>the individual case and the Chancellor<br>would determine what was just by<br>reference to his and of course it was<br>always a he conscience and that of<br>course sometimes was described as<br>discretion or just simply the embodiment<br>of justice<br>it appears to involve an individual<br>moral judgment that's what conscience<br>means but what is interesting of course<br>is that the Lord Chancellor's and of<br>course Thomas More was one of them were<br>ordained there was a theological<br>grounding to their<br>interpretation of conscience I think<br>that might be significant and I'll come<br>back to that later<br>later on there is evidence that the<br>language of conscience was used to refer<br>to the testimony of witnesses<br>witnesses and parties were only allowed<br>to give testimony as to what was in<br>their own knowledge so the defendant<br>might be testifying as to their<br>conscience by reference to what they<br>knew<br>thirdly<br>equity developed so that conscience<br>referred<br>specifically to the defendants<br>conscience but as determined by the<br>court and this was very much a cathartic<br>jurisdiction the court actually saying<br>we are determining that this is what<br>your conscience demands you should do<br>you should provide a remedy because<br>conscience demands and in the very<br>famous Earl of Oxford skates Lord<br>Ellesmere said the office of the<br>Chancellor is to correct men's<br>conscience that's the cathartic<br>jurisdiction moving into the 18th and<br>partly 19th centuries the language of<br>conscience were simply used to describe<br>equitable doctrine equity was the<br>conscience jurisdiction and<br>fifthly and this is my term but I think<br>we can bring the development of<br>conscience up-to-date by reference to<br>what I call the rhetorical conscience<br>and I actually regard pit and halt as<br>being a good example of that a case<br>where the language of conscience is used<br>to justify a result to justify equitable<br>intervention but it's actually a<br>smokescreen because when you look behind<br>it there's nothing there there's nothing<br>you can really identify<br>to determine what conscience actually<br>means other than the judges own sense of<br>what is fair and just<br>now you might even say having looked at<br>that brief history we've gone full<br>circle if you accept that notion of<br>rhetorical conscience isn't that rather<br>like the Chancellor's conscience this<br>idea of an individual moral judgment but<br>you might say it's different because at<br>least the Chancellor's conscience<br>purported to be founded on<br>theological considerations when<br>certainly we don't purport to do that<br>today<br>so that just shows you the complexity of<br>the development of conscience now in the<br>paper which accompanies what I'm talking<br>about and this can be circulated to<br>anybody who's interested I spend a<br>significant amount of time focusing on<br>the different interpretations of<br>conscience in quite often fairly<br>contemporary judicial developments and<br>analyses of the law at both in England<br>and to some extent in New Zealand with a<br>bit of Australia as well and in doing<br>that I<br>identify four<br>interpretations of conscience<br>the first is most definitely<br>subjective conscience specifically<br>having regard to the<br>defendants mental state and using<br>unconscionability as a form of men's<br>rare and we can actually see that in<br>areas of law involving the creation of<br>equitable proprietary rights and to some<br>extent in the action Falun conscionable<br>receipt I will say at this point I could<br>I'm really tempted to to get really<br>technical and get into the nitty-gritty<br>of equity some of you wouldn't be very<br>interesting you'll be really interested<br>in that I'm not going to and just giving<br>you a few broad headings to illustrate<br>that how these different types of<br>conscience who interpret it but<br>certainly fault for unconscionable<br>receipt can be interpreted in that<br>subjective sense there are cases<br>involving objective conscience again a<br>fault element but determined by<br>reference to what the court considers<br>the defendants mental state should be by<br>reference to a reasonable standard<br>albeit having regard to facts known by<br>the defendant so the action for<br>dishonest assistance illustrates that<br>and particularly and a really<br>interesting example of New Zealand in<br>English law going hand-in-hand<br>at setting aside a contract for<br>unconscionability where an objective<br>fault element relating to conscience is<br>identified thirdly I think there are<br>cases where the language of conscience<br>is used to refer to what the judges or<br>the courts conscience demands but<br>reference to recognized principles this<br>isn't a smokescreen of conscience it's<br>actually a principled approach and I<br>think proprietary estoppel is a really<br>good example of that and then fourthly<br>there are plenty of examples of the<br>courts conscience but being used as a<br>rhetorical device a smokescreen I've<br>already mentioned pit and halt and in<br>England at least in the 1980s we had a<br>body of law developing where in the<br>context of illegality where a<br>transaction would be set aside because<br>of the taint of illegality if the public<br>conscience demanded it now of course<br>there's a reference to the public but<br>the reality was it's the judges<br>conscience thinking that is the right<br>result but when you look at it there are<br>no principles underpinning it that is<br>rhetorical conscience so there are four<br>senses of conscience<br>now in a minute I am going to suggest a<br>new approach to conscience what I call a<br>new taxonomy of conscience but to<br>explain that and maybe you've already<br>got a hint of where my concern is with<br>the interpretation of conscience I do<br>want to say something about judicial<br>discretion which is actually one of the<br>other papers I've been delivering at the<br>law schools I have been visiting and I'm<br>actually delivering one tomorrow at the<br>law school here<br>so that there'll be much more detail in<br>that but just to give you an idea about<br>judicial discretion<br>discretion is used a great deal by the<br>courts and by commentators it's<br>discretion a good thing or a bad thing I<br>have a sense and I realize this is going<br>to be a generalization and rather<br>stereotypical but I have a sense having<br>taught a lot of New Zealand law students<br>met New Zealand academics and judges as<br>well that you seem quite happy as a<br>general rule with giving your judges<br>discretion in this country you have many<br>statutes which specifically give judges<br>discretion I think in England we are<br>much more concerned about giving our<br>judges discretion we don't trust our<br>judges that's stereotypical<br>generalization but I think there is a<br>difference of approach you seem happier<br>with judicial discretion here<br>interestingly Thomas More in Utopia was<br>really happy with discretion he actually<br>said this is his utopian ideal the law<br>and judges should avoid arcane<br>interpretations and debates about law<br>but should instead judge the overall<br>equity or justice of a situation and<br>decide accordingly so arguably in Utopia<br>there are no law schools because there's<br>nothing to discuss you just let the<br>judges get on and determined what equity<br>or justice demands in England and of<br>course he was writing in England but in<br>England there are other views and my<br>favorite is a dictum of Lord Camden<br>admittedly delivered in<br>1795 but he said the discretion of the<br>judge is the law of tyrants it is always<br>unknown it is different in different men<br>it is casual and depends upon<br>Constitution in temper and passion in<br>the best it is oftentimes<br>priests in the worst<br>it is very vice folly and passion to<br>which human nature is liable to views<br>about discretion now I have to say I<br>actually share law Camden's view or at<br>least I did until I read an article<br>which was published in 2013 and this is<br>the point at which I start to get into<br>some more jurisprudential territory out<br>of my comfort zone in<br>jurisprudence to various people there<br>about discretion and various academics<br>at Harvard said why don't you present a<br>short paper to the law faculty about<br>discretion and Hart did and they<br>obviously really liked it<br>but that paper was lost not published<br>until<br>2013 when it was found and published in<br>the Harvard Law Review and Hart's paper<br>simply called discretion has had quite<br>an influence on my own thinking<br>particularly relevant to this topic<br>about conscience because Hart said<br>discretion is not a bad thing the<br>distinction is not rule versus<br>discretion which we would typically<br>regard as the distinction actually the<br>real distinction is between rule judges<br>applying a clear rule and<br>arbitrary choice it's arbitrary choice<br>which is the bad thing where a judge is<br>just<br>making a decision without any structure<br>being provided by the law without any<br>identified reasonings with reference to<br>principles<br>and it's that which judicial discretion<br>its judicial discretion involves the<br>judge<br>evaluating the facts in the context but<br>making a decision by reference to<br>recognized principles so that the<br>evaluation judgment can be<br>defended and when you analyze discretion<br>like that and realize it's really a<br>choice between discretion and arbitrary<br>choice I think we can use that to create<br>what I've called a new taxonomy of<br>conscience in<br>my view it is perfectly acceptable to<br>use the language of conscience and maybe<br>we ought to replace the language of<br>conscience because of unacceptable<br>overtones but I have no problem in<br>saying it refers to the defendants<br>conscience and then to say clearly<br>sometimes that will refer specifically<br>to the defendants state of mind a<br>subjective test of fault and that will<br>be exceptional in equity but are the<br>other times to say the defendants<br>conscience refers to an objective<br>assessment of the defendants conduct in<br>the light of the facts as the defendant<br>knew them or believed them to be that<br>actually is how conscience as a state of<br>mind is typically interpreted in equity<br>I would prefer to call that dishonesty<br>to distinguish it very clearly from the<br>subjective state of mind again in the<br>paper accompanying this I elaborate on<br>that and it gets rather into some other<br>technical equity but I'm perfectly happy<br>with conscience in that state of mind<br>sense but crucially if conscience is<br>being referred - as the judge<br>exercising conscience or reference to<br>the courts conscience it cannot be<br>rhetorical conscience because that is<br>arbitrary choice that does not involve<br>the judge<br>exercising discretion<br>properly defined<br>conscience in terms of the courts<br>conscience has got to be principled<br>discretion Hart Ian discretion and if we<br>accept that and we find the court<br>referring to the language of conscience<br>without<br>identifying the principles that underpin<br>the exercise of the judgment it is<br>unacceptable in my view that is what<br>Lord Walker was doing in Pitt and Holt<br>and that therefore is a critical flaw in<br>Lord Walker's analysis in that case now<br>I could go on in some detail about the<br>implications of this analysis I in the<br>paper I talk about how it affects the<br>determination of fault in equitable<br>claims I don't want to look at that now<br>conscious of time I just want to look at<br>one particular<br>application of what I'm talking about<br>and that is the role of conscience in<br>the law of unjust enrichment<br>now the law of unjust enrichment is<br>recognized in England and it is<br>recognized in New Zealand I am well<br>aware that there are some people in this<br>room who think it shouldn't be<br>recognized either in England or in New<br>Zealand but it is we can argue about<br>whether it should but it is<br>and it's interesting looking at the law<br>on unjust enrichment the modern law of<br>unjust enrichment for those of you who<br>don't know<br>essentially says that if you can<br>establish that the defendant has been<br>enriched to your expense in recognized<br>circumstances that can be characterized<br>as unjust and that's not using unjust<br>like unconscionable in a rhetorical<br>sense it is grounded on established<br>categories then restitution will follow<br>so if for example I pay money to you<br>thinking I owe you that money and I<br>don't<br>you are liable to pay the value of that<br>money back to me you've been enriched by<br>the money you were enriched at my<br>expense and it was my mistake that<br>caused me to pay the money to you<br>incorrectly and both in England and New<br>Zealand we would analyze that claim<br>using the language of unjust enrichment<br>what he's interesting is when you go<br>back to the origins of unjust enrichment<br>and the language of unjust enrichment<br>was not used then but the origins at<br>least of the law of restitution<br>where Lord Mansfield in the mid 18th<br>century developed what has become the<br>law of unjust enrichment the language of<br>conscience was specifically used<br>restitution should be awarded because<br>conscience demanded it sag low and Evans<br>is one of the leading cases and I've<br>chosen that particularly because that<br>was decided exactly two hundred and<br>fifty years ago<br>midway between utopia and today so<br>conscience is there but today we don't<br>use conscience very much in the context<br>of unjust enrichment maybe that we was<br>being used in this rhetorical sense or<br>maybe<br>unjust enrichment is the principle<br>underpinning conscience and then the<br>question is whether conscience is<br>actually adding anything and arguably it<br>isn't and it's actually a<br>herring which we should ignore<br>so that's the English approach and as I<br>say that has really influenced what's<br>happened in New Zealand as well<br>Australia is interesting and I'm really<br>grateful I'm standing in New Zealand<br>because of what I'm about to say<br>although I have said some of this in<br>Australia myself<br>Australia has had a profound influence<br>on the development of the modern law of<br>unjust enrichment<br>Australia recognized applied and<br>developed unjust enrichment before we<br>did in England in the<br>1980s the High Court had a profound<br>influence on our thinking about unjust<br>enrichment<br>but more recently something odd has<br>happened because of different membership<br>of the High Court of Australia and you<br>can particularly identify it with<br>certain personalities<br>unjust enrichment has been rejected most<br>recently in the Australian Financial<br>Services and Hills industries case which<br>said we don't talk about unjust<br>enrichment the focus instead is on<br>whether it is<br>unconscionable for the defendant to<br>retain the enrichment and if it is<br>restitution should be awarded it's all a<br>matter of conscience now I'm<br>paraphrasing slightly but there is a<br>clear undertone from the Australian High<br>Court saying all this unjust enrichment<br>stuff is it's what England has developed<br>and we're not going to have all this<br>English stuff being imposed on us we are<br>going to have conscience we are an<br>equitable jurisdiction<br>conscience is at the heart of<br>restitution<br>forgetting perhaps conscience can be<br>traced back to the English cases and<br>Australia developed the Jews students on<br>unjust enrichment before England so<br>that's where we are in Australia they've<br>rejected unjust enrichment it's a test<br>of conscience but which sense of<br>conscience is it is it's subjective<br>fault well in Hills they said it's<br>strict liability so certainly not<br>subjective fault and certainly not<br>objective fault either so the choice is<br>either it's the courts conscience in a<br>principled sense or the courts<br>conscience in this rhetorical sense so<br>what is the principle is there a<br>principle underpinning conscience and<br>I've read Hill those industries really<br>carefully and I can't find one there is<br>no reference to any<br>indication as to how you should<br>determine where the restitution should<br>be awarded all we have in that case it<br>is a suggestion that there are legal<br>principles but they are grounded on<br>equitable notions of good conscience and<br>there are equitable concepts available<br>but they're not identified<br>now that suggests perhaps that Australia<br>is doing something fundamentally<br>different from what's going on in<br>England and in New Zealand as well<br>but actually I don't think they are<br>the hill's industries case was<br>essentially a mistaken payment case it<br>was slightly more complicated about a<br>settlement made and to settle a dispute<br>on mistaken grounds and actually a lot<br>of the discussion was about whether the<br>defendant had changed its position<br>having been enriched<br>but if we treat it as a case involving<br>money paid to a defendant by mistake and<br>the High Court accepted it would be<br>unconscionable for the defendant to<br>retain that enrichment what would make<br>it unconscionable surely it was the fact<br>that the defendant had received money<br>had received that money from the<br>claimant and the<br>claimant was mistaken in other words the<br>only way you can give any sense to<br>unconscionability is by reference to the<br>component parts of unjust enrichment I<br>have no doubt that that case if it was<br>heard in New Zealand or in England would<br>be decided in the same way maybe some<br>some different interpretations of the<br>defense of change of position but the<br>core response to restitutionary<br>liability would be the same and I think<br>there's an important lesson there that<br>if we aren't careful and we fall into<br>the trap of using conscience without<br>identifying under the underpinning<br>principles it collapses into<br>arbitrary choice and that is no way to<br>structure our private law<br>now there are other implications of my<br>analysis relating to remedies which I'm<br>not going to look at now but just to<br>pull this together what are my<br>conclusions I have no problem in<br>distinguishing between the conscience of<br>the defendant using conscience to<br>reflect false and the conscience of the<br>court as long as they we are really<br>clear that we are doing that and why the<br>conscience of the defendant can be a<br>test of fault which is usually assessed<br>objectively and I would wish to call<br>that dishonesty to make it clear<br>subjective assessment of fault is also<br>exceptionally appropriate in equity<br>particularly to create<br>three rights but crucially it is<br>legitimate to refer to conscience and<br>unconscionability to refer to the<br>conscience of the court or the judge but<br>only in a hearty and judicial discretion<br>sense it has got to be founded on clear<br>principles to structure reasoning<br>ultimately and fundamentally the true<br>role of conscience in contemporary<br>equity reflects a battle over the nature<br>of private law and there is a spectrum<br>of approaches that can be adopted at one<br>end there is an idea of the pure logic<br>of the law which is founded on reason<br>and predictability where there is no<br>role for conscience at the other end and<br>this is a view I know<br>reflected in many judgments and many<br>judges like is the desire to reach a<br>just result on the facts but maybe using<br>conscience as a smokescreen to hide<br>behind I think more<br>interpreted the role of equity in that<br>way<br>my view is that the preferable approach<br>falls somewhere between those two<br>extremes<br>principled justice<br>principled conscience is<br>justifiable principled conscience has a<br>legitimate role to play in contemporary<br>equity but only when the principles are<br>identified and I think mores utopia<br>would be a complete disaster I mean I<br>think in mores utopia I wouldn't have a<br>job because mores utopia<br>actually doesn't involve law the real<br>utopia does involve law but it does<br>involve judicial discretion<br>it is nuanced but it's principled there<br>is a legal structure and it's that legal<br>structure that we need to spend our time<br>very carefully<br>now I have said I'm really happy to<br>answer any questions or receive any<br>comments from you on that I can predict<br>what a couple of the comments might be<br>you may want to<br>not publicly raise a question or comment<br>but speak to me afterwards I'm really<br>happy to stay around for a bit and talk<br>to anybody who's got any comments on<br>that but are there any questions anybody<br>justice what is<br>it true that you're interesting you have<br>a reductive view of conscience in the<br>sense that you don't really need any but<br>you've got the principle so what do you<br>make conscience for anymore right that's<br>just a conscience it's just a<br>placeholder that<br>whatever comment on that either I<br>accept that complete and that's really<br>what I was saying with unjust enrichment<br>what what what what what is conscience<br>addict and and particularly dangerous I<br>mean I don't mind for traditional<br>reasons using it but of course if we<br>hide behind in don't unpack it it is<br>and that is focused on<br>equivocations in the use of the term<br>conscience absolutely right but it needs<br>to be done you know but I would say that<br>there's also a problem with the use of<br>the term discretion and and I think<br>asked us wrong because he's not talking<br>about discretion he's something about<br>something else he's talking about what<br>if we went lawyers we could just call<br>judges<br>this team ends up well let's say I have<br>my friend has bought some really ugly<br>shoes<br>and my friends really happy we're pretty<br>proud of them and asked me what do you<br>think of my what do you think of these<br>say<br>what do I say oh they're lovely the<br>intensity was so I've got to try and<br>think about one now let's say I'm a side<br>look what I'm really about to do here is<br>I<br>come to the conclusion that there is a<br>theme<br>it's this<br>right it's not a discretion but only the<br>discretion I'm sure I have to make<br>there's no rules here it's not as if<br>there are rules that came for - I have<br>to make adjustments in the light of the<br>relevant principles but it's not<br>so essentially what you're saying is<br>that the arbitrary choice a phrase he<br>uses quite a lot in that paper is<br>actually what discretion is and judgment<br>is<br>what he's calling - so we could play<br>around with the word my immediate<br>response to that problem was of course I<br>preface my reference to discretion to<br>judicial discretion if there was a judge<br>who was required in the case to say<br>whether these shoes look good or not the<br>judge would<br>put all sentimentality at the picture<br>and say well they're rubbish<br>don't suit you don't get any damages etc<br>now what that okay whether that's<br>discretion or judgment we can talk about<br>that<br>okay I think ultimately that may just be<br>playing a rap I mean important but<br>playing around with the words to the<br>core of what I'm saying is okay we're<br>let's call it judgment it's got to be<br>principled and that's my real concern<br>with quite a lot of private law where<br>okay<br>that's a big question really interesting<br>what my immediate response is and of<br>course within equity there's an awful<br>lot of discussion of that yeah is equity<br>really about conscience to answer that<br>you have to unpack conscience clearly<br>equity is a lot about spending time<br>analyzing fault in that analyzing what<br>the just response should be and true as<br>well there's an awful lot of equity as<br>applied rigidly which appears to work<br>against what the just response might be<br>but I would say and and of course there<br>were areas the law you can throw against<br>me that increasingly I think there is a<br>role for equity in the commercial world<br>in the family law world etc to be used<br>to do what it originally did which is to<br>say here is the strict common law we<br>need to qualify it by reference to<br>equitable principles I mean I'm<br>certainly we are seeing that in various<br>jurisdictions as to what is being done<br>for cohabiting couples and dealing with<br>property rights and actually I was<br>critical of Pitt and Holt Pitt and Holt<br>is essentially with there were two cases<br>there which concerned tax avoidance and<br>in peatón halted itself poor mrs. Pitt<br>whose the money that was held on trust<br>was provided as damages for her<br>seriously injured husband in an accident<br>she actually went to a solicitors and<br>what do I do with this<br>and also the scheme was approved by the<br>Court of Protection to say this is the<br>best way of using the money and it all<br>backfired that seems to be an entirely<br>appropriate way a case where you unwind<br>the transaction compare another case<br>which was footer and footer which was<br>one of these very bit a bit like the<br>Duke of Westminster<br>recently died and actually in in England<br>not much inheritance tax is going to be<br>paid because of discretionary trusts<br>where maybe we are having an abuse of<br>the trust and there is a role for equity<br>so we are not going to help you there so<br>but certainly there is a concern about<br>manipulation of a tax system using the<br>truck and of course the Trust is an<br>equitable device so I mean there's an<br>awful lot I could say in response to<br>that I I am actually increasingly<br>confident that equity has a really<br>important role over the next few years<br>in dealing with some of the big<br>commercial problems that we have now we<br>don't need to relate it to conscience<br>I'm happy to do so if we can identify<br>okay<br>No so so really this is me grabbing hold<br>of an article I'm thinking I can use<br>that to structure my thinking he was not<br>talking about equity cases what is<br>interesting as well and there'll be<br>people here who've read more about this<br>than I have this was a relatively early<br>paper from heart on discretion and his<br>thinking developed subsequently<br>so I think there is there's a there's<br>more work to be done in tracing how he's<br>thinking perhaps<br>changed and certainly in the debates<br>with fuller that that appears to be<br>perhaps at odds with my description of<br>this particular paper I mean what is<br>very interesting from a u.s. perspective<br>in the mid to late 1950s and early 60s<br>this was a really live issue about<br>discretion particularly in public<br>administration etc and I think it it<br>flowed into some of those discussions as<br>well<br>so I don't think certainly you you can't<br>say oh he's just talking about equity he<br>wasn't but he wasn't really engaging<br>with the fuller debate at that point he<br>I think this was just thoughts about<br>bread thank you very very much indeed<br>you said<br>and I thought that was quite commendable<br>exceptional<br>anyway this is just the formal vote of<br>bands I thought this stream link gate<br>lecture I think<br>we are in his depth and I suggestively<br>signify our planks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
