the University it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you here for this<br>inaugural professorial lecture the<br>inaugural professorial lectures are an<br>opportunity for our newly appointed or<br>promoted professors to tell the<br>university community and members of the<br>public about the research that they<br>undertake as I'm sure you're all aware<br>since you are here this evenings<br>professorial lecture will be given by<br>Carolyn King also known as Kim King her<br>lifelong nickname<br>Kim was born in England and studied at<br>Liverpool and Oxford University's her<br>first PhD from Cross College Oxford was<br>the first ever full-length study of the<br>field of ecology of British weasels it<br>was completed in 1971 and immediately<br>led to an invitation to move to New<br>Zealand to join DSi DSi our ecology<br>division as a specialist on introduced<br>carnivores and especially stoats<br>between 1977 and 1994 when family<br>concerns took priority Kim worked<br>part-time from home writing papers and<br>books and editing scientific journals<br>for the Royal Society of New Zealand<br>she came to the University of Waikato as<br>a visiting scholar in 1991 and joined<br>the staff in 1995 teaching zoology in<br>the Faculty of science and engineering<br>her research interests have concentrated<br>on the ecology of invasive rodents and<br>mustelids especially States and ferrets<br>rats and mice<br>much of the information needed for the<br>field study of these animals in the New<br>Zealand context was not available to<br>start with so Kim began by developing<br>new techniques for monitoring and<br>sampling small predators in the wild<br>these techniques have been widely used<br>and proof by others allowing a greater<br>understanding of small predator<br>populations that is still the basis of<br>much pest control work today<br>Kim's first book immigrant killers<br>published in 1984 was the first review<br>of the ecology of introduced predators<br>in New Zealand<br>it made some controversial statements<br>which stimulated a lot of later research<br>her two best-known books the natural<br>history of weasels and stouts and the<br>handbook of New Zealand mammals both<br>went into second editions with Oxford<br>University Press in<br>2005 and 2007 respectively<br>in 1989 Kim began to explore another<br>area of her interests that is the<br>relationship between traditional and<br>contemporary explanations of how the<br>world works that led to her completing a<br>second PhD in religious studies from our<br>department here at Wakata and two<br>further explorations on the interface<br>between evolutionary biology and<br>contemporary theology which resulted in<br>the book published in 2002 habitats and<br>grace<br>Kim received the annual award from the<br>New Zealand ecological society in 1999<br>the silver medal of the mammal society<br>in 2005 and the kudos Lifetime<br>Achievement Award in 2010 ladies and<br>gentlemen will you please welcome Kim<br>King to give her inaugural professorial<br>lecture<br>good evening ladies and gentlemen Thank<br>You vice chancellor for your kind words<br>and then for your presence here and<br>thank you all for coming because you<br>have given me the opportunity to review<br>and<br>celebrate my lifelong fascination with<br>these beautiful and widely misunderstood<br>animals and it is rather a<br>timely time to be doing this because as<br>you realize a few months ago the<br>government made a massive announcement<br>of 28 million dollars which is to be put<br>forward to achieving the very<br>aspirational getting game of predator<br>for free in new zealand by 2050 it's not<br>that they're going to pay for the actual<br>work themselves the idea<br>it's just as well because other<br>estimates reckon it's the actual cost<br>will be in the billions not millions but<br>the idea is to establish a joint venture<br>company run by people who have the<br>vision and the passion and the<br>conviction that it is possible to find<br>the technological innovations and the<br>social change required to achieve this<br>goal<br>of course when it was advertised<br>overseas or purported OSes there were a<br>lot of skepticism I had a letter from a<br>friend of mine in Adelaide who asked me<br>if it was a hoax it isn't a hoax but<br>it is not going to be easy and it's<br>really important to look at it in<br>context and one of the contexts that<br>needed to be recognized which is often<br>not recognized is the fact that this is<br>not the first time that New Zealand has<br>faced the crippling losses caused by an<br>invasive pest at the end of the 19th<br>century the damage done by rabbits to<br>fast release holding in the<br>southern South Island was so severe that<br>many run holders had to simply walk away<br>from their land their sheep were dying<br>that lamb percentages were reduced<br>enormously that wool clip was reduced<br>they were absolutely desperate and some<br>of them really had no option except to<br>live and that meant that the runs were<br>up again for re letting at a different<br>rental and<br>very often the land inspector had to go<br>with the owner and view the devastation<br>captioned this country is so poor even<br>the rabbits bring a cut lunch<br>their own holders were so desperate to<br>retrieve their fortunes they looked<br>around everywhere to find more and<br>better ways of killing rabbits and what<br>better could be then the natural<br>predators which could perhaps be the<br>reason why Prentiss about rabbits got so<br>abandoned because they these natural<br>predators were not here so they sent to<br>England and they imported thousands of<br>stoats and weasels that figure there is<br>the number that I've been able to trace<br>in records in import records and<br>shipping reports of stoats and weasels<br>that were brought in over a short period<br>of ten years and<br>also because ferrets are domesticated<br>and easily obtained and easily bred in<br>captivity over about twenty or thirty<br>years something upwards of seventy five<br>thousand of these were bred in studs<br>around the South Island for release on<br>the worst of the pastures damage so with<br>that number of predators attacking the<br>rabbit you would think that they ought<br>to have made a huge amount of difference<br>well they did kill a lot of rabbits but<br>problem is it's not just the number<br>killed it's the number that they left<br>over and the number that were missed and<br>how quickly they breed and how many<br>animals come in from outside so the<br>problem with rabbits is that they can<br>breed much faster than produced remove<br>them here's a little diagram that goes<br>back to John flux who was one of my<br>colleagues in DSR ecology division in<br>the early days<br>/ tanned rabbits and here ecology and he<br>pointed out that if you had an area of a<br>square kilometer you might have of the<br>order of about two thousand rabbits in<br>the worst areas but you could probably<br>only have about five cats and maybe five<br>each of the other predators and they<br>couldn't possibly even remove the annual<br>increase of twenty thousand young a year<br>so there was never any possibility that<br>they could keep the rabbits down so what<br>happened was that in the South Island<br>you can have a range of rabbit density<br>and this is the proportion of those<br>killed by the native predators and what<br>happened if you remove added the<br>mustelids it's increased the predation<br>rate but not high enough to knock down<br>the recruitment rate so it was a<br>last-ditch attempt to control the<br>rabbits but it didn't work<br>the same story on a smaller scale can be<br>retold in targa haveli this is a valley<br>just west of tiana in the mountains<br>there where the tiger he which was a<br>native bird that was thought to have<br>been extinct for 50 years was<br>rediscovered in 1948 and the Wildlife<br>Service at the time thought that all<br>they needed to do was to close the area<br>to human interference and set traps for<br>studs and they did that and by the time<br>I arrived in New Zealand in 1972 they<br>were wondering how they could improve<br>what they were doing because although<br>they were catching starts the numbers of<br>tiger he still were going down so they<br>took me up to target haveli at the<br>beginning of winter a real experience<br>but when fresh out of England and they<br>asked me what can we do to make this<br>situation better and my answer was we<br>need to understand and how stoked<br>populations work it's fairly clear that<br>you can't control a population<br>artificially unless you know what<br>controls it naturally so that question<br>was the first one that I had to embark<br>upon and I didn't know the answer at the<br>time but I did have the advantage of an<br>English country childhood where<br>everything alive was a fascinating<br>interest I had my as my main companions<br>as a child horses and dogs and there are<br>wonderful tutors about animal life I<br>went to a very good grammar school where<br>had an inspiring zoology teacher who<br>gave me a solid grounding in classical<br>Liverpool and then finally to Oxford<br>where I had the enormous privilege of<br>working on weasels in the famous white<br>of wood<br>almost the only thing they remember me<br>for my time there was that I was first<br>an only student in the history of the<br>University of Oxford who managed to<br>persuade the department of zoology to<br>it was obviously to me the simplest<br>thing a pony is much cheaper to buy much<br>cheaper to run makes much less noise and<br>fuss and afoot to me it was obvious I<br>don't know why not more people do the<br>same<br>however we had I had in those years a<br>good introduction to how weasel<br>populations work and I also had a lot of<br>help from game Clippers now although<br>weasel starts are native predators in<br>Britain native carnivores valuate for<br>that their own game estates regarded as<br>pests because they kill the flightless<br>game chicks when they're very young so<br>there's been a long history of game<br>Cooper's developing systems of<br>systematic trapping to remove stoats and<br>weasels from the game estates from the<br>breeding areas particularly in the<br>spring breeding season and I learn from<br>them<br>to operate these systematic tunnel<br>trapping and particularly how they used<br>the fen trap the fen trap is the humane<br>alternative to the Jin track the<br>leg-hold trap which was banned in<br>England in 1958 and it's designed to be<br>worked in a tunnel so that the jaws of<br>the trap close over the back and the<br>spine of the other one instead of<br>holding it by the foot and this is not<br>only very much more humane than a leg<br>hole trap but also it guarantees much<br>better chances of getting animals that<br>are good for studying because the<br>animals don't have the chance to break<br>their teeth on the trap or chew off<br>their own foot or evacuate their gut so<br>that meant that they were much better as<br>samples for study so I started off by<br>introducing the fen trap into New<br>Zealand because I was a bit just amazed<br>to find that the Jin trap was then and I<br>think still is legal in New Zealand so I<br>made sure that the Fen trap was used in<br>all the areas where the ranges of the<br>national parks were collecting stoats<br>for me and then I started working out<br>ways of monitoring and sampling starts<br>in areas where that where it was too<br>large or too remote to use traps and<br>that's where the the next challenge was<br>to work out how to figure out where they<br>were and roughly how many there were<br>without actually catching them and the<br>answer to that was to use a tunnel which<br>has in the tunnel a central ink pad and<br>papers on either side which were able to<br>pick up prints that would be made by the<br>animal running through the tunnel and<br>leaving their footprints now this<br>illustration here is the original<br>version as was published in 1977 in the<br>days when scientists were not supposed<br>to try to make a profit out of their<br>work for the days and this was public<br>domain and of course it was that made it<br>much easier to be taken up and listened<br>not in that version but in the latest<br>version which was taken up as it could<br>be because it wasn't copyrighted by a<br>company called gotcha traps and they<br>make these much lighter and easier to<br>carry<br>tunnel traps and these are the standard<br>version but it was the same idea the<br>same idea was taken up from that work<br>published in 1977<br>so after knowing where they are and<br>roughly how many of there are the second<br>thing you need to know to understand<br>Stoke populations is how they're<br>breeding their breeding cycle and a<br>breeding cycle of states is really quite<br>extraordinary it's unlike any other<br>animal you can think of this is<br>a cross-section of the ovary of the<br>stone and I know that that animal was<br>mated because every one of these little<br>bodies here is called a cupola - a<br>corpus luteum and every one is a one for<br>one replacement for an egg that was<br>released and fertilized so if you can<br>take serial sections of both ovaries of<br>a female and then count these little<br>bodies as they come into and out of and<br>through that the serial sections you can<br>end up by having a fairly clear estimate<br>of the fertility rate of those animals<br>in all different circumstances this is<br>Jenny Moody one of my most helpful and<br>patient technicians we between us<br>sectioned both ovaries of<br>528 females which took quite a while<br>the interesting thing about how Stokes<br>proceeded from that point is that<br>instead of implanting the fertilized egg<br>into the uterus as most mammals do the<br>youth the first stage of the cell which<br>is just a little ball of cells called a<br>blastocyst it develops for about two<br>weeks and then it starts just floating<br>free in the uterus but it is maintained<br>by the hormones produced by the<br>corporate here and they remain in that<br>relationship for nine months which means<br>that the females which are fertilized in<br>November one year don't produce their<br>offspring until August or September of<br>the following year and that means that<br>all the females that you can sample for<br>the intervening months all have these<br>handy little badges to tell me how what<br>their fertility rate was then when it<br>comes to the actual production of the<br>young how many of those blessed assists<br>which actually turned into nestlings<br>depends on how well fed the female is if<br>she's very well fed a lot of them will<br>be or even all of them and if she's not<br>very well fed she may lose some or even<br>most of them and so you can look at the<br>fertility rate of in the second year to<br>see how they the femurs adjust their<br>productivity to the food which is<br>available in that season even though<br>they didn't know what it was when they<br>first made it and the other even more<br>extraordinary thing about stok<br>reproduction in case you didn't think<br>any of that was extraordinary enough<br>is the fact that the young females when<br>they're only about six weeks old and<br>still with their eyes shut and barely<br>able to stagger around the nest fully<br>reproductively mature they have a very<br>early puberty which means that the male<br>who visits the nest to serve their<br>mother will also Rumble around through<br>the nest trying to find all the females<br>and he will fertilize all of them as<br>well and if this sounds like an animal<br>version of rape it's not that the<br>females the young females get terribly<br>excited when they smell the male coming<br>into the nest and they rush around after<br>him and true after him and<br>incite him to fertilize them it's in<br>their interest to do that because every<br>female then that leaves the nest is<br>already fertilized and anywhere she goes<br>even to a place where there are no other<br>stoked like on an offshore island she's<br>already got the makings of a new<br>population within her and you may ask<br>how the male's know the difference and<br>the answer is that there's this little<br>main but under neck here it's about the<br>only hair they have at the time and<br>underneath it is a gland that gives a<br>scent which is different in males and<br>females so the male knows what he's<br>picked up and if it's a male and he just<br>drops it and if it's a female he<br>impregnates it are the third thing we<br>need to know about how stoked<br>populations work is how long the adults<br>live it's been known for a long time<br>that if you look at the root of one of<br>the canine T's and this is a canine<br>tooth upside down that so the point of<br>it is at the bottom at the root there<br>are often lines in the dental in the<br>cementum here and it would be very<br>convenient if those happen to be annual<br>because they would give you the age of<br>the adult and it's easy to assume that<br>but you can't do that unless you're<br>quite sure and have made the connection<br>with a set of known aged animals so we<br>set up an experiment before<br>appeared when we thought that the young<br>were going to be very abundant and we<br>captured them in live traps as opposed<br>to phone traps and we put ear tags on<br>them and release them in the hope of<br>getting some of them back and in that<br>year we marked and released 134 tagged<br>stoats of all ages we got 22 of them<br>back and the answer was when we looked<br>at them and the field data and the<br>histological data that the correlation<br>between their real age and the lines in<br>the tooth really is true they those<br>lines do tell you that the age in years<br>of those animals in that 22 the most<br>number we ever got was 5 but then when<br>we applied the same technique to a much<br>larger group of animals collected from<br>all over that all the national parks we<br>found very rarely there were a few that<br>to six to eight years but most of them<br>didn't live past this or even to their<br>second birthday so most states live a<br>short life and a very few live quite a<br>long life and this was what we needed to<br>know in order to estimate the input and<br>output of the stokke population<br>now this is important because in the<br>beech forests that cover so much of the<br>South Island there is a tremendously<br>significant event that happens every so<br>often what's called a beach masked event<br>when all all most of the trees all dump<br>a huge amount of seed on the ground at<br>once and<br>this is a predator evasion technique on<br>their part because the more seed there<br>is the less like thing is that all the<br>seed will be eaten but on the ground at<br>that time this is heaven for the forest<br>rodent and so the rats and mice<br>eat a lot of the seeds instead of<br>stopping breathing in the autumn like<br>they usually do they breed right through<br>the winter and the stoats whatever what<br>strokes are there there may not be very<br>many but they're very well fed and<br>by the time of the spring time you've<br>got a lot of female starts in very good<br>condition producing very large numbers<br>of offspring just as the time that the<br>rats and mice are beginning to disappear<br>so when those young come out in the<br>following summer you've got a huge<br>increase in the numbers of young studs<br>which have now been to compete with each<br>other for food and as the mice are<br>disappearing and of course that is<br>extremely bad news for the birds so<br>having put together all that we figured<br>out about how populations work that<br>meant that we could then understand what<br>was going on during the breach cycle so<br>what it boils down to is that after a<br>seed fall we get lots more mice and lots<br>more mice means lots more stoats and<br>lots more stoats is newse the birds<br>because they tend to the stock that<br>tends to include roughly the same<br>proportion of birds in any density of<br>mice because there aren't enough mice to<br>distract them from eating birds and so<br>that means that if they're all eating<br>about the same number of birds per head<br>but there are more of them it means a<br>huge increase in predation on birds<br>so the question is can we in fact<br>prevent the damage to the bird<br>populations as a result of this long<br>series of events and the answer is you<br>have to remember the basic principle<br>that it can only reduce the number of<br>animals in a population if you are<br>taking them away faster than they can<br>replace themselves and basically you<br>have to be able to add to their natural<br>mortality and because their natural<br>mortality varies so substantially<br>through the year through the beach<br>master year because their fertility and<br>survival also very naturally it depends<br>what point in the beach cycle you set<br>traps as to how much difference you're<br>going to make so if you set traps<br>during the winter when<br>there aren't very many stoats but<br>they're very well fed that means that<br>you can kill a lot of stones this is the<br>raw number of stoats killed and this<br>here is the true removal rate and<br>because they would have lived and bred<br>on their own because they in that period<br>they're very very good Nick then any<br>that you can kill at that time is a<br>bonus because you're removing some that<br>could have bred and lived themselves the<br>problem is because there aren't very<br>many of them at that time it doesn't<br>seem to be so urgent there doesn't see<br>if you're much too damaged the damage is<br>much more visible in the following year<br>in the following summer when what we've<br>got is lots and lots of states something<br>like about times five increase in the<br>numbers of state and they are<br>contributing to he the amount of damage<br>to the bird but because by then the mice<br>are already disappearing they and they<br>have tremendous competition with each<br>other their survival rates has gone<br>right down it's much more difficult in<br>the safe four year to exceed there to<br>add to their natural mortality and so<br>what you've got here is a large number<br>of animals caught but only a few that<br>otherwise would have bred so basically<br>you're substituting for natural<br>mortality rather than adding to it<br>clearly travelling through a beech seed<br>fall which has been standard for a long<br>time because it was the only thing we<br>could do isn't going to cut it<br>especially not at very high<br>densities and at very large landscape<br>scales something better is needed at<br>landscape scale which is needed to<br>protect the birds<br>so a new strategy has been done since<br>2014 to 15 and the doc now is confident<br>enough of what the consequences are<br>going to be of a beech seed for first of<br>all they just they just check that<br>they're going to be in an increase in<br>rodents over the winter and they set the<br>the now standard version of the<br>footprint tunnels and then they set in<br>train are very carefully organized very<br>well supervised 1080 operation over very<br>large areas which I needed to protect<br>these vulnerable birds and 1080 I<br>assure everybody I agree it's an awful<br>thing to have to use but it's the best<br>we've got right now and we've got to<br>hang on to the birds we've got until we<br>get something better it really does work<br>very well because a lot of rats are<br>killed and a lot of stoats are killed<br>because they eat the rats that have<br>taken the poison and then doc will<br>check that they have actually done the<br>job by doing another of tunnel tracking<br>to compare the number of the percentage<br>of tunnels tracked before and after and<br>if they've got after the 1080 drop<br>almost no tunnels tracked and that means<br>that the 1080 operation has been<br>successful and just recently only about<br>last week they began a doc published the<br>results of that<br>2014-15 operation and which they were<br>able to look at the improvement in<br>nesting success of four species of birds<br>in places where they had dropped 1080<br>and in places where they didn't and as I<br>say because the counting the number of<br>dead animals is really doesn't tell you<br>very much because you don't know what<br>proportion of the population you've<br>removed therefore stones can't tell you<br>whether it was helpful or not you have<br>to ask the birds that and that's what<br>they were doing here they were<br>monitoring nesting success and so in<br>these three four species the Mahua or<br>yellow head<br>the rifleman the rock crane and the<br>South Island Robin they all benefited<br>from the removal of rats during their<br>breeding season and they have had much<br>greater<br>brilliant success in that year then<br>would have happened if doc had done<br>nothing of course bit first isn't the<br>only place where vulnerable birds live<br>of course national icon the Kiwi is a<br>matter of great concern and the young<br>ones this one is a Patmos territory<br>which is a good safe place for young<br>Kiwi because under six months or about a<br>kilo in weight they can't fight off a<br>stud they're much too<br>vulnerable to being killed by States if<br>there are any it doesn't take very many<br>steps either to make a difference so<br>Morgan Territory is a great place but<br>it's even though it's the largest of its<br>kind it's still far too small to produce<br>a self-sustaining population of Kiwi for<br>that you have to have a place of about<br>twenty thousand hectares where it's much<br>too big to fail and<br>impractical to trap at the density<br>required so 1080 is used there too and<br>these figures fund the tongariro forest<br>QE sanctuary which show fairly clearly<br>that every time there's a 1080 drop the<br>survival of the Kiwi trick goes up it<br>doesn't last because of course the rats<br>and the start to come back but then you<br>do it again and you can repeat the same<br>benefit<br>so temporary benefits are really<br>important on the mainland but the only<br>permanent protection of course is on an<br>offshore island far enough away from the<br>mainland to be able to achieve an<br>eradication and prevent reinvasion and<br>over the last 50 years or so dock has<br>improved the techniques for doing that<br>starting of course with the largest and<br>easiest targets on a large island but<br>over time improving technology and<br>confidence so that nowadays it's routine<br>to get even quite small pests off large<br>islands and a dock is rightfully very<br>proud of this and New Zealand has pretty<br>well the only global export industry in<br>techniques and expertise in island<br>allocations their work is required all<br>over the world so it became a pretty<br>nasty shock when two islands which had<br>been eradicated cavity and rangitoto at<br>huge expense were suddenly reinvade by<br>stoat and the question that was asked at<br>the time was could stoat actually have<br>swum across that water gap it's much<br>further than what was considered to be<br>the farthest that is total swim which at<br>the time was taking those one and a half<br>kilometers or is it possible that they<br>were taken there by some malicious human<br>action the question had to be resolved<br>by how fast those could swim and to<br>answer that question I conducted an<br>experiment here<br>moment could only have been done here at<br>Waikato because it required the use of a<br>firm which is a sort of a waterway with<br>a continual current circulating through<br>it and you can set it at whatever speed<br>you wish is normally of course used for<br>fish but we wanted to use it to see how<br>animals could swim we started off by<br>borrowing a couple of rats to check<br>techniques in our procedures<br>they were rather unimpressed with this<br>we we gave them back to their owners not<br>happy but at least much cleaner than<br>when we borrowed them and then we<br>brought in our stoats and ice totes we<br>watched swimming against the current and<br>one of them could swim for two solid<br>hours without stopping a total of two<br>kilometers that's a kilometre an hour<br>and which was perfectly within the<br>possibilities of starts being able to<br>get onto those islands particularly if<br>they had bit of help from a current or<br>from a floating look so this work has<br>revisited<br>reviewed the idea of how many islands we<br>have at safe distance from reinvasion of<br>stats and it could only have been done<br>here at Waikato thanks to the friends in<br>the aquatic research centre<br>so going back to the question we started<br>from is the idea of predator free New<br>Zealand feasible and<br>that requires the answer requires<br>looking into the future and this is a<br>very difficult thing to do a very risky<br>thing to do but there are writers<br>particularly science-fiction writers<br>who've been doing that all the time and<br>one of the most famous ones is arthur c<br>clarke and he wrote this that basically<br>people who know their stuff if you ask<br>them whether something is possible that<br>they might be around about that but<br>they're not very good at predicting the<br>future into the realm of impossible and<br>I can<br>appreciate that because I was present at<br>a meeting in Wellington in 1976 where<br>they were debating how large an island<br>you could get rats off and anybody who<br>was anybody at in New Zealand at the<br>time was there and they all agreed that<br>about one hectare is the largest island<br>that you could clear from start well one<br>mark - Clarke they were wrong<br>his second point is that if you want to<br>know what possible you have to go past<br>what you think is the boundary of the<br>puzzle and here again Clarke was proved<br>right because only a few years after<br>that meeting two of my former colleagues<br>from dear SIA dared to defy the advice<br>of their boss and go and take Rhett of<br>Norway rats off breaks the island which<br>is 170 hectares and they they cleared<br>that Island the rats in three weeks and<br>since then the boundaries have been<br>improved leave a further Campbell Island<br>11,000 hectares in only this short<br>period of time 76 to 2001 the size of an<br>island that could be cleared has been<br>increased by orders of magnitude so it<br>would be a very brave person who would<br>look ahead another 25 years and ask what<br>we could do or try to<br>decide what could be done not knowing<br>what techniques might be available in<br>the future future<br>Clarke's third law is probably that one<br>that's best known and if he's right<br>again and he may well be it will mean<br>requiring inventing techniques that<br>really are not much different from magic<br>because the techniques that are needed<br>to achieve printer freenas in and in<br>2050 have to be free of side effects it<br>must not<br>cause increase of lower-level predators<br>released from control it must meet<br>social concerns about expenditure and<br>use of<br>the techniques I mean look at the amount<br>of protest there is about 1080 already<br>and it must get past the fact that<br>nature is on the animal side that is any<br>individuals which are capable of evading<br>whatever you throw at them are<br>automatically the parents of the next<br>generation and Pat producing offspring<br>that are just the same and then of<br>course there's the little matter of the<br>enormous costs so we're looking for<br>something which is as different from<br>what we now know as the electron<br>microscope is from the light microscope<br>and it's it's going to be as impossible<br>for us to predict that as it was for the<br>people who are at the 1976 meeting could<br>predict what's happened now and so<br>basically here's another quote from<br>somewhere or other a very<br>thing to keep in mind we if we're going<br>to do this we've got to do it ourselves<br>we have to create a potential future<br>printer free New Zealand<br>in a comment that was made to me by one<br>of my overseas<br>correspondents was well it sounds pretty<br>difficult but if anybody can do it the<br>New Zealanders can do it because of our<br>reputation for a can-do attitude and a<br>real<br>desire to see this outcome<br>so looking at all of that over there all<br>the<br>45 years that I've been working on these<br>animals here in New Zealand I have to<br>say that it's the best place in the<br>world to to research these animals when<br>I was working on the second edition of<br>my book I found that a fully a third or<br>more of the global literature about<br>stats came from New Zealand we have made<br>an enormous and disproportionate<br>contribution to the the general<br>knowledge of these animals and it's the<br>same with ferrets that's not an<br>exportable<br>industry because there's almost nobody<br>in the world who has as many feral<br>ferrets as we have but feral ferrets are<br>a handy surrogate for another pest which<br>is very much more serious in the<br>northern hemisphere at least the<br>American mink they're about the same<br>size and they're related and you can<br>find out quite a lot of useful stuff<br>from ferrets that helps and is in fact<br>already been helping to inform<br>management of American mink so for me<br>it's been an enormous privilege to be<br>able to work on these animals in this<br>country and I'm so incredibly grateful<br>for that and for the people who made it<br>possible<br>mix southern was my doctoral supervisor<br>and he was the most important influence<br>in my life in those years then John<br>Gibbs was the one who gave me my first<br>job in New Zealand and I was there with<br>dir for those years and then after a<br>long gap when I was doing other things<br>were actual Vesta in 1991 was the one<br>who made it possible for me to get a<br>foothold here in the university so I am<br>enormous ly grateful to all of those and<br>also to any number of colleagues<br>wonderful colleagues here and in other<br>institutions and I've had some<br>absolutely great students and colleagues<br>in in the category of colleagues I<br>include not just academics but all the<br>wonderful teams of technicians and<br>libraries and secretaries without whom<br>in this place would just simply run<br>aground and then there have been funding<br>opportunities when I needed them know<br>very rarely very large but enough to be<br>able to take advantage of the<br>opportunities I had and then finally of<br>course the unwielding support of my<br>family and friends and especially my<br>husband Ken Ayers thank you Ken thank<br>you all of you for coming and sharing<br>this story with me good night<br>Thank You Kim what a comprehensive and<br>fantastic story that you've told us<br>tonight before I reflect on what you've<br>shared with us I'd like to invite the<br>president of the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand emeritus professor Richard<br>Matata Couture<br>vice-chancellor thank you for this<br>opportunity to use the occasion of<br>Professor Kim King's address to<br>acknowledge another contribution that<br>she has made in her presentation tonight<br>she made passing reference to some years<br>between the time she was here and the<br>time she was working as a scientist and<br>ESI are<br>those years stretched to 33 years of<br>service to the Royal Society of New<br>Zealand firstly as an editor of the<br>Society's premier journal the Journal of<br>the Royal Society and then as an editor<br>of<br>the journal that deals with zoology she<br>actually led the team that developed<br>that journal as a<br>independent and separate contribution to<br>the literature<br>this is an outstanding contribution in<br>terms of editorial work and the Royal<br>Society wanted me if I was able to come<br>to Hamilton to present to professor King<br>a<br>certificate in recognition of her<br>service it's not something the Royal<br>Society does very often but in this case<br>it's obviously a very meritorious<br>contribution and<br>we hope she hasn't got too many copies<br>of it a major book that has been<br>published on the viola biology and<br>conservation of a venerable survivor the<br>tuatara<br>because I'm sure that much of the work<br>that Professor King is doing is also<br>going to contribute to preserving so<br>many of our really important native<br>species so professor King it gives me<br>I<br>won't keep you long I understand drinks<br>are outside now I'm sure many of you<br>have questions of Kim that you can ask<br>out there but Kim<br>what a wonderful story that you've told<br>us tonight in fact as a biosecurity<br>scientist it's it's fascinating to see<br>the terrestrial side of the event<br>you've shared with us the fact that if<br>you want to achieve biosecurity outcomes<br>you absolutely have to understand the<br>animal that that you wish to eradicate<br>and even more importantly the<br>contribution that science makes not only<br>to achieving those outcomes but to the<br>policy decisions and the societal<br>engagement that we have<br>predator-free New Zealand will require<br>as many<br>dedicated and comprehensive scientists<br>as you into the future and I think that<br>we can achieve that outcome it is a<br>significant one and hopefully we'll<br>actually dip our feet into the water as<br>well when we're making it predator-free<br>that was a truly professor really dress<br>please join me in congratulating Kim on<br>receiving her professorship</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
