so thank you very much for<br>inviting me so i guess i've been invited<br>to pets to give a bit of a practitioners<br>perspective someone who's out there<br>hopefully kind of leading the way and<br>how we're shaping our city and to be<br>responding to the challenges that are<br>facing us so I'm just to be really clear<br>this is my um my stance on climate<br>change unless we take action future<br>generations will be roasted toasted<br>fried and grilled so being so absolutely<br>I'm absolutely adamant we need to do<br>something about it so not be under no<br>illusion of my office Victor and then in<br>terms of my perspective I think it's<br>going to talk to you a little bit about<br>the work that we are doing within<br>panocha specifically a 1-yard quarter<br>and then I'm going to share with you<br>sort of somewhere ideas for I think my<br>ideas the hell we need to shape Auckland<br>City keep our new key aqui tengo doll so<br>I much like the Walker run the walk out<br>together going forward trying to really<br>transform okay and so punny<br>co-development auckland was set up and<br>so timber last years or a year old now<br>and it was a merger fro between water<br>fun Oakland and Oakland council property<br>limited a real desire by the council to<br>try and sprinkle the magic that we've<br>delivered at one yard quarter so it's a<br>wonderful honor to be part of that<br>organization and a huge challenge to<br>kind of move out into the rest of<br>Auckland and try and help check those<br>places so got a vision for shaping<br>spaces for all convinced to love<br>and how we do it we have a different<br>approach what's kind of really key and I<br>think the scene will come through my<br>speech that's come through others as the<br>whole idea of collaboration we can't<br>deliver these things alone so how do we<br>do that and so at panda who have been<br>given a really strong mandate to do that<br>to take to become a lead agency to focus<br>on delivery and really am start making<br>some change happen<br>so I'm obviously one of our asked our<br>star project as the window quarter<br>hopefully many of you are familiar with<br>it it's been absolutely and a pleasure<br>to be able to be involved in that<br>project and to see that project evolved<br>come out of the ground and become a<br>place that Oakland has really love to be<br>part of so I think I want to talk a lil<br>bit about so i guess the evolution of<br>the work we've been doing so I think the<br>organization very much made of stamps<br>when it for staten that time I needed<br>fish go with the flow so we could have<br>done what everybody had always done and<br>that we wouldn't have got what we've got<br>so I guess thinking about how urban<br>development normally be delivered you<br>have a piece of land you do the minimum<br>you need to do to get to the market your<br>market it and you sell it to the highest<br>bidder and you maximize your profit so<br>that would be the traditional urban<br>development not for us some of the early<br>development partners here tonight so<br>it's great to have a come in the room we<br>have a different philosophy that I think<br>our approach at wynyard quarter was we<br>were far more clear and what we actually<br>wanted to achieve for that um that part<br>of Auckland so we had a whole lot of key<br>ingredients that have really helped us<br>kind of deliver what we have and we've<br>got a mandate from Auckland as Oakland<br>has told us that we needed to be shown<br>leadership around sustainability we went<br>out and I'm consulted on a waterfront<br>plan they asked us to put that in there<br>so the blue-green waterfront was a<br>really key path so that mandate was<br>really important really committed<br>leadership a really strong board really<br>strong and leadership team<br>within waterfront or condone her now /<br>know Keith we were clear really clear on<br>where we want it we went out to the<br>market with a set of standards we went<br>out with a set of sustainability<br>standards design standards we see what<br>we wanted in terms of community<br>infrastructure I'm to develop over time<br>so you know don't be afraid to ask what<br>you want and we embedded those<br>requirements and development agreements<br>so they can't get out of not doing what<br>we want me to do and we have integrated<br>design so we do the whole way this is a<br>real partnership between us and the<br>private sector and the work that we're<br>doing down there we have independent<br>reviews we have our work scrutinized we<br>really transparent about our performance<br>etc and and I think just want to show<br>you some of the examples of our<br>associates down there so this is<br>just gone live so we have done the<br>modeling for all our seven-year<br>buildings that are under construction<br>and when you're quarter at the moment<br>and compared to business as usual<br>buildings we are saved in 4.6 gigawatts<br>of electricity per year because we've<br>set those really high standards but were<br>those building owners and we're getting<br>some fantastic buildings coming out and<br>I had the pleasure to be at the opening<br>of the waterfronts theater this morning<br>and it's going to be the first five<br>green star-rated hopefully when it gets<br>this rating and theater in New Zealand<br>and the other thing that I'm<br>exceptionally proud of announcing its we<br>only found out about yesterday but the<br>window caught a redevelopment has made<br>it to the finals of the c40<br>woods so we're a finalist in sustainable<br>communities category and there's huge<br>achievement achievement and in<br>recognition of the work that we're doing<br>around kind of leading the people<br>haven't changed so i'm really proud of<br>that and so i guess you know selected<br>finalists of demonstrated bold<br>leadership implementing projects so just<br>to go to show auckland can do it and we<br>can do it really really well we just<br>need to do more of it so some ideas on<br>how to am shape auckland so we need to<br>think like a system now these this is<br>all thinking it's not new thinking at<br>all but i don't think we often think<br>like a system and so we are looking to<br>use systems thinking for a lot of the<br>we're now doing within panicky we can't<br>do things alone we're operating<br>communities with us lots of existing<br>networks in place and so we need to<br>start thinking like a system and so<br>there's two projects are about to kick<br>off and the pulmonary stream restoration<br>project in monaco as part of our monaco<br>project and we want to pull together all<br>the people they're going to be part of<br>making that project successful so we<br>need to start thinking like a system I'm<br>coat everything we use the mood<br>collaboration so incredibly loosely and<br>freely but you know I don't think we<br>generally know what it means yet to do<br>it in career to be well and I think it's<br>something that remains one of our<br>greatest challenges to move beyond the<br>rhetoric this is a great example of<br>something that I think we should aspire<br>to in Auckland and is something that<br>merely and brown is really interested in<br>as well so this is a city studio that's<br>been set up by the city of vancouver<br>it's a real true collaboration between<br>business technology I'm City Hall the<br>citizens and staff within the council so<br>you've got they've got this cut hub that<br>sits within an city hall where they all<br>work collectively on challenges and they<br>all you know come up with ideas and<br>permit them together and I just think<br>that kind of idea of something that I<br>really like to see and in Auckland our<br>continuous improvement I think we really<br>need to look to some of these some of<br>the systems that are used with an<br>industry and business continued to prove<br>it also not in your idea but I think so<br>what can we do something and we kind of<br>forget that we need to keep doing the<br>next thing we kind of rest on our<br>laurels a little bit so I think<br>continuous improvements really important<br>so you know we really have to kind of<br>keep moving on as Auckland we can't<br>think we've ever sold something just<br>because a built a fortunately a new road<br>or even a new rail link we're going to<br>have to keep doing things going to have<br>to keep changing<br>keep reviewing and can come and keep<br>moving forward I'm sir innovation and I<br>think innovation and sustainability and<br>extra lean linked and I just think orkin<br>to move forward we need to look to the<br>innovation technology sector look at<br>some of the way they do things look at<br>the whole fast fail as a really<br>interesting concept not something that<br>governments normally like to kind of<br>think about that now let's go skip them<br>things ago we don't have to know all the<br>answers to get started it's get started<br>if we know it's not working let's stop<br>and do something else and I think we<br>need to kind of have a culture of I've<br>been able to do that I think we can<br>learn an awful lot of the innovation<br>sector around that and then I'm<br>globalization so the idea that you know<br>we have to realize we're in a global<br>context and we've heard about the global<br>context but we really have to kind of<br>make things about local and come up with<br>local solutions and really work locally<br>this is where the projects that I'm<br>really proud to have been involved in<br>its kind of our a mini example of our<br>city studio and we're just about to the<br>challenge wraps up in a couple of weeks<br>but this is where we've gone to a UT and<br>MIT students in Monaco were presented to<br>challenges to the move ask those<br>students to to devise some solutions and<br>we're providing them support and so<br>we're having they'll come up with<br>solutions for their communities then we<br>can make the commitment to help<br>implement what they come up with so my<br>kind of four big ideas think like a<br>system Kurt everything continuous<br>improvement globalization and then I<br>think just as you know what this can<br>deliver for us this was Jellico street<br>and 2009 down at one yard quarter still<br>an active port and that's what it looks<br>like today so I think we can really make<br>change and we can do it quite quickly<br>and do some many special things for<br>condos and I think they really deserve<br>it so looking forward to talking more<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
