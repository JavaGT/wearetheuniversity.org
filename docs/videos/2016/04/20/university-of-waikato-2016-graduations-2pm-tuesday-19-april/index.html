mathematical<br>Sciences<br>Engineering<br>pukaha my name is Neil Quigley I'm the<br>vice Chancellor of the University of<br>won I'd like to begin by thanking all of<br>you the grad<br>your family and friends for taking the<br>time to celebrate with the University<br>staff and others from the woto community<br>the important event uh that is your<br>graduation this is a time to reflect on<br>the learning and the personal growth<br>that you've achieved in completing your<br>degree to give thanks for the<br>opportunity that you've had to meet<br>students from a diverse range of<br>different countries and to spend time<br>with the friends that you've made while<br>studying at the<br>University during the course of your<br>study you'll have acquired a perspective<br>on the world that you could not easily<br>have acquired through any means other<br>than University<br>study I hope that for all of you it is<br>true that you've completed your degree<br>with both the critical thinking and The<br>Real World skills necessary to create a<br>smooth transition into employment or<br>further<br>study many of you will have taken part<br>in some Community engagement program as<br>part of your experience at the<br>University whether through volunteer in<br>work placements and practicums or summer<br>scholarships our aim as a university is<br>to substantially increase this level of<br>Engagement with the<br>community so please once you are settled<br>in employment talk to us about ways that<br>you can help provide internships or work<br>placements for our students in the<br>future or otherwise help by promoting<br>your University locally as well as on<br>the world<br>stage ladies and gentlemen it's now my<br>pleasure to introduce the chancellor of<br>the<br>university the role of the chancellor<br>dates back to the founding of the first<br>universities in the Middle Ages today<br>the chancellor has the role of shairing<br>the University Council the governance<br>body of the university and in that<br>capacity it is his role to confer the<br>degrees on all of the gradu of the<br>University ladies and Gentlemen please<br>welcome the chancellor of the University<br>of wakato the right honorable Jim buer<br>to the many chiefs the elders women The<br>Walker and The Home People my warmest of<br>greetings good afternoon and a very warm<br>welcome to everyone especially the<br>graduates here before us their family<br>Faro and friends to this very special<br>event graduations of course recognize<br>years of study and hard work challenges<br>overcome successes achieved today we<br>will all share in that success when the<br>capping ceremony takes place<br>shortly I want to acknowledge the<br>University of white carage Vice<br>Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley and to<br>congratulate him<br>on his first 14 months at the home at<br>the leadership of the<br>University also want to acknowledge the<br>other Deans and Senior academic staff<br>and general staff who are in attendance<br>this<br>afternoon the vice Chancellor says that<br>the role of Chancellor goes back to the<br>Middle Ages I just wanted to observe<br>I've been here for a while in this role<br>but not quite that long you know just<br>not quite that long but first from a few<br>thoughts on where tomorrow is leading<br>us I won't Bore You by saying the world<br>is changing as the real question is are<br>we prepared have we the skills and most<br>importantly have we develop the value<br>system that will help us to respond to<br>the needs of our common<br>Humanity we all see the tide of<br>distraught refugees on our TV screens<br>every<br>night what is their individual<br>response do we blame the<br>refugees or say it's all too much for<br>little New Zealand to do much about or<br>do we write a letter to our local MP<br>urging the government to do<br>more or do we just switch to the sports<br>channel and forget all about it I<br>reflected on this very recently when<br>talking about refugees to a young two<br>young people brother and sister from<br>Sweden Sweden is approximately twice the<br>size population of New Zealand and yet<br>it takes about 20,000<br>refugees New Zealand has a quota of just<br>750 which country is responding to the<br>needs of our common<br>Humanity Canada is a country we see<br>somewhat like New<br>Zealand it's taking currently a thousand<br>refugees for<br>everyone for every one that Australia<br>takes at<br>present and overall Australia has a<br>higher per capita quota than New<br>Zealand fortunately New Zealand is to<br>review its quota and hopefully we will<br>be generous for many ways we're all<br>refugees from<br>afar there is a wider purpose<br>for me raising this<br>issue as all will hear various<br>commentators commenting on the csy<br>sector over the next few months as the<br>productivity commission has been tasked<br>with the responsibility of an in-depth<br>look at the provision of tertiary<br>education in New Zealand you know in<br>advance that most of their<br>recommendations will be related to<br>whether New Zealand is getting an<br>appropriate return on the money invested<br>by taxpayers students and their<br>families we all know also that some<br>areas are easier to measure than<br>others the news media carried a recent<br>article which headlined was headlined<br>big bucks for the right<br>graduates impressive that showed if<br>money was the end goal then you should<br>all have studied medicine I'm sorry to<br>tell you that because that by far earned<br>the most<br>money that was a headline that's you get<br>the bucks from measuring earning<br>earnings is easy but measuring value to<br>the community is much<br>higher but from my perspective much more<br>important on the issue of the<br>challenging value type issues that we<br>face let me comment on a couple I do so<br>because it is the genu a generation that<br>are graduating here this afternoon where<br>the real implications will be<br>felt preventing individuals and<br>corporate circumventing a country's tax<br>laws by transmitting their income to<br>various offshore tax Havens only<br>requires Parliament to pass the<br>appropriate amendment to existing laws<br>politically it's a no-brainer as the<br>vast majority pay their taxes and they<br>understandably want everybody else to do<br>the same all that's required it's a<br>necessary political will across the<br>political spectrum and the is issue can<br>be resolved<br>quite simply more challenging by far is<br>the question of climate<br>change there is no simple law change<br>that any Parliament can pass to bring an<br>immediate end to climate<br>change it is a long-term<br>challenge the New Zealand Herald<br>yesterday or the day before carried an<br>article originally carried in the<br>Washington Post in Bloomberg News which<br>added to the many previous scary<br>scenarios in part the report deals with<br>what the White House describes as quote<br>one of the gravest threats to the US<br>major health problems associated with<br>climate<br>change a new<br>approach these these risks include<br>thousands thousands of more premature<br>deaths from respiratory problems growth<br>in mental health problems because of the<br>stress caused by extreme weather events<br>and a new issue that Rising carbon<br>dioxide in the atmosph atmosphere could<br>lower the nutritional value of some<br>crops these are in addition to the more<br>common issues of rising tides and<br>flooded communities which normally<br>capture the<br>headlines but here we should pause also<br>cuz a new headline came out yesterday a<br>new report that says 2/3 of new<br>zealanders live in flood PL<br>areas that makes you think doesn't it<br>certainly includes<br>me the Guardian newspaper in London also<br>carried a recent article about the<br>financial cost of climate change as<br>modeled by the London School of<br>Economics this postulated that by<br>ignoring climate change the world's<br>Financial assets could be cut by<br>3.7 trillion New Zealand dollars or they<br>then went on and said in the worst case<br>scenario<br>us24 trillion for 17% of world assets<br>wrecking the world economy not<br>pretty so why are we doing so little why<br>are we not<br>moving then we suggest a simple move<br>from which everyone would gain and that<br>is to promote the switch to hybrid and<br>electric vehicles Norway despite being a<br>large oil producer is doing this by<br>removing taxes from electric vehicles<br>and they are therefore now cheaper than<br>the dirty<br>Alternatives the Netherlands home of<br>course to the great uh petrochemical<br>industry Royal dut shell is going<br>further and their Parliament the last 24<br>48 hours are voting to ban listen to<br>this ban the sales of new petrol or<br>diesel cars by<br>2025 a short 9 years<br>hence for New Zealand with 85% renewable<br>electricity and move to electric<br>vehicles is clearly the way to help<br>reduce carbon emissions and reduce the<br>cost of importing oil<br>products well sounds pretty good to me<br>I'm raising these issues because I want<br>why could a<br>graduates you to go out into the<br>community and vigorously debate these<br>issues don't just put a frame copy of<br>your degree on the wall do that of<br>course but use your knowledge and the<br>values gained at White to help promote<br>the changes that that are necessary for<br>the survival of a healthy clean<br>Society I which wish each and every<br>graduate well as you follow your dreams<br>and perhaps recall George George Bernard<br>Shaw's<br>advice imagine things that never<br>were and say why<br>the chancellor will now officially<br>confer the degrees and diplomas on the<br>gradu here today and those listed in the<br>program but not in<br>attendance I the Right

Sciences with<br>first class<br>honors he's returned to Hamilton for<br>graduate uation from Quebec in Canada<br>where he is studying for his Masters in<br>computer<br>science Chris excelled during his<br>studies at the University of wakato<br>receiving several Awards and<br>scholarships including two deans awards<br>for excellence a taught postgraduate<br>scholarship and a two degrees ICT<br>scholarship Chris has a particular<br>interest in Data Mining and artificial<br>intelligence ladies and gentlemen will<br>you please welcome to the podium to give<br>the student address Christopher Beckham<br>this is definitely the biggest audience<br>I've had to write a speech for<br>so uh before I start I'd like to thank<br>the chancellor right honorable James<br>buer and vice Chancellor Professor Neil<br>Quigley for the opportunity to speak on<br>behalf of today's graduating<br>class the feeling of missing home didn't<br>sink in until I was lying in the bed of<br>a shoddy room I Ed on Airbnb on the<br>outskirts of Montreal I had arrived in<br>the midst of a snowstorm one that surely<br>marked the start of a gruesome<br>winter many flights were delayed<br>including my own and I was without my<br>luggage for several days my slice of<br>home everything felt like a STK contrast<br>to the familiar and homely feeling of<br>New Zealand especially considering I had<br>parted ways with many great friends in<br>an awesome summer I mean not that I care<br>if it's summer or not because I'm<br>usually in a lab with no<br>windows however I reminded myself that<br>in a few months I would be back in New<br>Zealand to catch up graduate and bring<br>some closure to an amazing and fruitful<br>Journey I'd like to congratulate my<br>fellow colleagues on graduating for all<br>of us it has been a long journey one<br>paved with many highs and lows many joys<br>and<br>frustrations for some of us we'll be<br>going on to do more study probably<br>because we're too scared to find a job<br>or<br>something and for some of us we'll be<br>going back into the real world in the<br>hopes of finding a job and don't forget<br>to also pay back those student<br>loans if you plan to live overseas in<br>the future make sure you fulfill your<br>repayment obligations I'm not a legal<br>expert but student loan scheme Amendment<br>act 2014 Section 162a says that if<br>you're an overseas based borrower and<br>consistently default your repayment<br>obligation you may be arrested if you<br>try to leave New<br>Zealand but I digress Family Friends<br>Community I thank you all for being here<br>today it is an honor to be amongst you<br>and to be your student speaker for this<br>graduation ceremony<br>coming from a low desile Secondary<br>School in a town troubled by low income<br>and high unemployment I grew up in an<br>environment that wasn't particularly<br>conducive to the pursuit of high<br>education in high school it didn't seem<br>like many students had particularly High<br>aspirations and it was discouraging to<br>hear them say things like they weren't<br>St um they weren't smart enough to study<br>such and<br>such as if being good at something was<br>an innate ability rather than something<br>that you gained through hard work and<br>self<br>motivation I was lucky I viewed my<br>circumstances through a lens they<br>encouraged me to straight from the<br>status quo and give me the motivation<br>and drive to<br>succeed I wanted to go to university and<br>devote myself to the pursuit of high<br>education and the hopes of using that<br>knowledge to do great things and help<br>other people and what better University<br>to do that to uh at the University of<br>w whose motto is cang for the people a<br>beautiful campus situated in Hamilton<br>aka the Tron a city that seamlessly<br>Blends Urban and country located on the<br>banks of the beautiful White kto River<br>the city with the cheapest pack and safe<br>in the city of the infamous KFC<br>Bandit I still remember the first day I<br>arrived at the University of w to move<br>into the BR Hall residences all the way<br>from the far north yes it was a bit<br>nerve-wracking but those feelings were<br>quickly put to rest when myself and a<br>couple others on my floor were up till 2<br>in the morning having hearty<br>conversations like we knew each other<br>for much longer before being told off by<br>one of the<br>RAS I realized that this was because we<br>were all in the same position leaving<br>home for the first time parting ways of<br>familiar faces<br>and turning the page and writing a new<br>chapter of Our Lives I clearly remember<br>the saying Bryant Hall is your home away<br>from home and at the time thinking it<br>was a bit of a Cheesy saying but it's<br>actually true It Felt Like Home to me<br>and not only did it ease the transition<br>into University life had set me out with<br>many great friends and colleagues<br>including my flatmates I L for the past<br>3 years I very thankful for all the<br>support everyone has shown me throughout<br>this journey sometimes it is all too<br>easy to feel alone to feel like you have<br>nobody to talk to or relate to that's<br>what friends of for university has been<br>a time where not only have I learned a<br>lot about my field but about myself and<br>I hope that you have as<br>well I have some words of advice for my<br>fellow men and women listen to rap music<br>rappers always talking about how much<br>money they have and how they went from<br>Rags to Riches let them motivate you<br>through many hard and tiresome nights so<br>you can grow up and make a dough like<br>they do YOLO which stands for you only<br>live once a term popularized by rapper<br>Drake is a familiar acronym amongst the<br>crowd of irresponsible youth to justify<br>questionable decisions like starting<br>your assignment an hour before the<br>deadline because you are hung over from<br>last night's drunken Antics at the<br>Outback instead let us repurpose that<br>saying in the corniest manner possible<br>and use YOLO as a reminder for being the<br>best person you can come do not waste<br>your potential hn your skills challenge<br>yourself and aim to make a positive mark<br>on the world because after all you only<br>live<br>once on a more serious note don't stop<br>learning just because you graduated<br>there's still lots for you to learn but<br>that is okay because learning is a<br>lifelong journey that never ends I<br>really like the saying the more I know<br>the more I don't I know I don't know a<br>variant of the phrase I know that I know<br>nothing from Greek philosopher Socrates<br>because it naturally motivates me to<br>learn more about my field to quote<br>Andrew in co-founder of online learning<br>platform corsera and someone whom I<br>greatly admire the time you invest in<br>learning after school May entail little<br>short-term reward because there will be<br>no teacher to grade your work or<br>motivate you to study but if you can<br>make learning fun or talk to people that<br>you can learn from or set aside some<br>time each weekend to work is something<br>productive it will pay<br>off initially you may feel as if you<br>haven't gained all that much but if you<br>keep at it consistently you'll become<br>do I would like to make notable thanks<br>to past advisor and staff from The<br>Faculty of computing mathematical<br>sciences that have inspired me to reach<br>for the stars and in no particular order<br>these people are associate professor IA<br>Frank Professor Bernard faringer Dr Tony<br>Smith and Dr Lyn hunt you have all been<br>incredibly supportive on my journey and<br>I've offered many words of<br>encouragement what amazes me is how you<br>can both be incredibly intelligent and<br>humble at the same time a quality that I<br>greatly admire and hope to mirror for<br>the rest of my life This falls in line<br>with my own beliefs too I can never not<br>be humble for the more that I know the<br>more I aware of how much I don't know<br>thank you Chris
