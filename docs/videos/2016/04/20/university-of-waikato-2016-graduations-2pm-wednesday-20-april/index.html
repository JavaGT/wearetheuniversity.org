ten<br>thousand<br>other graduates of this universities<br>ladies and gentlemen it is now my<br>pleasure<br>to introduce the chancellor of the<br>university<br>the role of chancellor dates back to the<br>founding of the first universities<br>in the middle ages today the chancellor<br>has the role of chairing the university<br>council<br>the governance body of the university<br>and in that capacity<br>it is his role to confer the degrees on<br>all the graduates<br>of the university ladies and gentlemen<br>please welcome the chancellor of the<br>university of waikato the right<br>honourable<br>james bulger<br>along the way so that they arrived here<br>this afternoon<br>ready to receive the accolade of a<br>degree or<br>qualification after the years of study<br>here at the<br>university of waikato<br>the vice chancellor of the university<br>professor neil quickly has<br>been unable to be literate with it this<br>morning he's got a rather important<br>discussion with the minister<br>this afternoon but we're delighted to<br>have the<br>senior deputy a vice chancellor<br>here with us alistair jones thank you mr<br>fully remarked earlier<br>i also want to acknowledge local member<br>of parliament<br>david bennett david is a very loyal and<br>keen supporter of our university and<br>great to have you back again david<br>i'll just invite the audience to send<br>you a few more letters and things like<br>that<br>but seriously this is an extraordinary<br>day for<br>the lives of so many young and not so<br>young<br>people as we go through the whole<br>process<br>of the graduation and acknowledgement<br>which is what it is knowledgement of<br>knowledge of study of hard work<br>and a reward i thought i'd just checked<br>for a moment too on the<br>few things that crossed my mind what's<br>happening in the world<br>where tomorrow is going to lead us<br>some questions saying the world is<br>changing we all know that it's<br>too where it importantly are we prepared<br>for change have we the skills and<br>importantly have we developed<br>a value system i spend timeless have we<br>developed and developed a value system<br>that will help us to respond to the<br>needs<br>of our of our common humanity<br>one of the issues that is facing is<br>quite simple you know it's appropriate<br>since we have law graduates here today<br>and that is preventing individuals and<br>corporates<br>circumventing the country's tax laws by<br>transmitting their income to various<br>offshore tax havens<br>and not pay taxes the rest of us pay<br>taxes<br>they think they're clever they don't<br>think it's cheating<br>someone will even give the excuses<br>within the law<br>and the law to use the old vernacular is<br>an s<br>it allows people to avoid paying the tax<br>they should legitimately pay<br>to the society that provides you with a<br>home<br>and all they go so politically it's a<br>no-brainer<br>the vast majority pay their taxes just<br>to change the laws<br>to prevent people not doing that and<br>society will be<br>much better off and i hope that happens<br>soon<br>one of the great things we can't change<br>in today's world by the past<br>one law of course is climate change and<br>most of us<br>are now aware that that's not going away<br>anytime soon either every projection<br>every scientific report 31 that came out<br>only yesterday<br>focusing on new zealand we'd said<br>two-thirds<br>of where we live will be affected by<br>climate change<br>so that's another area where we need to<br>um<br>we need to keep moving one of the<br>challenges and why i'm talking about<br>some of these that you're going to hear<br>a lot about<br>tertiary education in the next little<br>while because the productivity<br>commission has been tasked with the<br>responsibility of an in-depth look at<br>the provision of tertiary education in<br>new zealand<br>the families the support group are<br>getting a<br>adequate return on the investment that<br>has been made in education<br>and some areas are much easier to<br>measure than others<br>some of you will have seen the media<br>story<br>two or three weeks back which was<br>headlined big bucks<br>for the right graduates i can say to<br>this<br>audience in the wrong place to these<br>venues because the big bucks<br>according to the article for those who<br>take medical degrees<br>but is that how we only can measure<br>success<br>but we're the big bucks i would argue<br>that measuring earnings is easy but<br>measuring value to the community<br>is much harder much harder from my<br>perspective<br>much much more important<br>so that's one of the challenging issues<br>we have<br>to we have to do i mean education<br>is a classic case to point<br>teachers are not the highest paid<br>professional<br>in new zealand but i would argue they<br>have the most important task<br>of providing the support the knowledge<br>and the input and the values<br>of the next generation of museums who<br>can be more important than that other<br>than their parents<br>so it's not all about where the big<br>bucks are<br>it's also about the values you bring if<br>i say to the<br>graduate the soon to be graduates it's<br>all about<br>what you add and i would urge those in<br>education of course since the minister<br>said<br>you are not required to teach new<br>zealand history<br>just ignore that and actually teach<br>teach your students about<br>an honest history of new zealand from a<br>colonial<br>talk about the battle of arakawa just<br>below us we'll go further south and<br>talk about that extraordinary village of<br>parihaka<br>where they practiced non-violence long<br>before<br>the great mohammed abandoned long before<br>peru and his team<br>said to the colonial settlers there is<br>enough to share<br>oh we don't intend to fight well that<br>was too much for the colonial mindset to<br>lock them up there you go but we need to<br>know this history so<br>please please teach that as well<br>i am i just want to conclude by saying<br>i wish you every success<br>i wish you great enjoyment in your<br>professional life after you leave after<br>you leave the university<br>no ethereum and jewelry light<br>try to keep aggression with everything i<br>know things are moving so quickly i<br>talked this morning<br>about the move to electric and hybrid<br>cars<br>this afternoon's news this is in the<br>course of a day it says we only need<br>about 50 000 motorcars in new zealand<br>self-driving<br>that's today's update on the news i'm<br>going to read the news as well<br>um i wish you well<br>you've come through the course<br>you have a great university's<br>qualification<br>with you now going forward and just<br>remember those<br>insightful words of george bernard shaw<br>think of things that never be<br>and ask why not enjoy<br>thank you chancellor it is my pleasure<br>to now introduce today's keynote speaker<br>dr warren scotter<br>dr scott is a consultant harkness henry<br>and a specialist in litigation<br>throughout his career he has taken<br>several active roles in law<br>administration<br>as president of waikato baya plenty<br>district law society council<br>chair of the high court practice<br>committee councillor of<br>the new zealand law society and a member<br>of the new zealand law society's<br>executive<br>more recently he chaired the law society<br>standards committee<br>for waikato bay aplenty he has been<br>instrumental<br>in improving the quality of legal<br>standards regulation<br>and has provided support for many new<br>lawyers entering practice in the region<br>in 2014 he received an honorary<br>doctorate from the university of waikato<br>in recognition of his 45-year<br>contribution to law administration in<br>the region<br>please join me in welcoming to the<br>podium dr warren<br>scott<br>chancellor assistant vice chancellor<br>ladies and gentlemen my topic today<br>is far removed from what is expected on<br>an occasion like this<br>it won't inspire any of you to be better<br>teachers or lawyers<br>but may i hope encourage some of you as<br>you enter the full-time workforce<br>to keep a an open mind about the path<br>that your careers<br>may follow strange<br>and unexpected opportunities may present<br>themselves over the next few years<br>if they do consider them they may lead<br>you<br>as they led me in directions that you<br>did not<br>ever consider a few days ago i was asked<br>by one of the law<br>i asked one of the law professors for<br>ideas uh about what i should say today<br>and surprisingly he said why not talk<br>about some of those famous rape cases<br>and he asked how it was that for a time<br>i had appeared to corner the market in<br>hamilton<br>for crimes involving alleged<br>sexual improprieties he thought that<br>might be interesting<br>well i hope he was right i<br>also hope that you'll see the funny side<br>of the<br>rather sad grubby little case where it<br>all started<br>i think the learned professor had in<br>mind high profile<br>cases involving men falsely accused of<br>rape<br>but those former clients of mine are<br>still all alive and<br>getting on with their lives and it<br>simply isn't appropriate to<br>revisit their stories years after the<br>dust has settled<br>my hands aren't completely tied<br>i can safely answer the question<br>where did this all start and talk about<br>a case from<br>very early in my career<br>it all started in 1972 with a little<br>case that may well have been<br>hamilton's last ever case of<br>brothel keeping i was approached by a<br>husband and wife then as i recall in<br>their late<br>50s recent arrivals from europe they<br>were to appear in court that day<br>on charges of brothel keeping charges<br>for which then they were liable to a<br>maximum<br>of five years imprisonment and the<br>situation was<br>utterly bizarre on the facts as they<br>narrated them<br>and because they presented as very very<br>ordinary people there are no fishnet<br>stockings and as for the husband he was<br>in<br>even then border than i am now he might<br>well have passed for a middle-aged<br>lawyer or schoolteacher<br>these people told me their story i'll<br>come to that in a moment<br>i told them that i believed that they<br>could successfully defend the charges<br>but that it would be many months before<br>the case would come to trial<br>they weren't interested in any defenses<br>they<br>wanted to plead guilty immediately<br>put the matter behind them and return to<br>europe<br>they told me that they had immigrated<br>here in the hope of providing<br>a better life for their only child a 15<br>year old boy<br>then enrolled attending a hamilton<br>school<br>now as i've said i'll come to the facts<br>in a moment but can i tell you now that<br>my reputation<br>for handling cases like this<br>a reputation that has been the despair<br>of my family and partners came about<br>largely as a result of some glib words<br>with which i<br>challenged the judge when asking him to<br>suppress<br>the defendant's names this is all these<br>people wanted<br>and the reason for that was a very<br>genuine one it was to protect their son<br>so i urged the judge to suppress the<br>names<br>for no reason other than the<br>inevitability that if their names were<br>not suppressed<br>readers of the waikato times would<br>identify the son<br>as the boy from the brothel i submitted<br>to the judge that the boy<br>should not be made the victim of his<br>parents wrongdoing<br>he should not have to learn from the<br>media<br>and his friends at school and i<br>quote that his mother was a his<br>father a pimp<br>and his home a whorehouse and those were<br>the words that were published above my<br>name in newspapers headlines throughout<br>the country<br>the next day and repeated on radio to<br>talk back four days thereafter<br>so the stage was set<br>and like it or not a rather pompous<br>conservative then church-going young<br>lawyer<br>became hamilton's go-to man for cases<br>involving<br>alleged sexual improprieties<br>now this case hasn't been remembered as<br>an illustration<br>of the huge changes in both social<br>attitudes<br>and the law that have occurred over the<br>subsequent<br>43 years it's been remembered and<br>talked about or rather laughed about<br>for a quite different reason seems that<br>someone had tipped off the police that<br>something untoward was happening<br>in a very ordinary two-bedroom flat<br>just a few hundred yards down the road<br>from where we are now and a team of<br>detectives was<br>sent to investigate and i suspect that<br>they approached this inquiry<br>with an attitude that would not have<br>been appropriate<br>if for example they had been sent to<br>investigate a murder<br>or a rape one young detective<br>coincidentally now a friend of mine was<br>sent to lead<br>busting with a radio transmitter<br>concealed in his jacket so that his<br>colleagues from the police car down the<br>road could listen in<br>and record the evidence the young<br>detective was met at the door<br>and i think it's appropriate to skip<br>through the details of the<br>next 10 minutes as the young detective<br>feigned embarrassment and the lady<br>offered encouraging and reassuring words<br>the point is the officers outside were<br>enjoying the<br>audio far too much to take their cue<br>and enter handcuffs already and arrest<br>these<br>these sad people so uh<br>after 10 minutes the the detective<br>uh in the height of embarrassment<br>and blushing still fully closed uh had<br>to<br>escape the flat and join his colleagues<br>laughing at his expense<br>in the police car outside now<br>on a more serious note in later years i<br>acted for defendants charged with rape<br>on at least<br>30 occasions and it has been my very<br>great privilege<br>and responsibility to have briefed to<br>have been briefed on a fair<br>number of occasions involving genuinely<br>false complaints of rape<br>so how did a young lawyer manage to<br>progress<br>from a rather sad little case such as<br>the one i've described to<br>hugely serious and responsible cases<br>on involving on occasions involving the<br>defense of genuinely<br>innocent men at least three of them at<br>the time<br>prominent members of the community<br>wrongly<br>falsely accused of rape<br>one can acquire those skills<br>and i got that experience mostly because<br>in 1973<br>year after the brothel case i<br>successfully defended the founder and<br>president of a motorcycle gang<br>a gang that still exists and occupies<br>the<br>same rather notorious premises in<br>hamilton<br>that connection provided me with at<br>least<br>one rape trial a year for five or six<br>years<br>the defendants the original members of<br>the gang<br>then or younger than me are i believe<br>now or dead but happily i was successful<br>and didn't incur the wrath of any of<br>them<br>so i've survived to tell this tale and<br>to benefit from the<br>experience they provided well<br>these cases have only been a very small<br>part of my practice over the past<br>46 years but they have provided some<br>highlights<br>the defense of alleged rapists<br>is not a path i would have chosen<br>it just happened ladies and gentlemen<br>about to graduate my contemporaries<br>teachers and lawyers had it easy we<br>started out when jobs were plenty and<br>when standards and expectations<br>were not nearly as great as they are now<br>but you have enjoyed a level of<br>professional<br>education vastly superior i believe<br>to that which was available in the<br>nineteen sixties<br>you haven't just learned facts you've<br>learned how to<br>think i congratulate you and hope that<br>you will<br>all enjoy your working lives<br>johnson thank you warren for taking the<br>time to address<br>the graduates this afternoon and give<br>the chancellor will

to the podium to give the<br>student address<br>good afternoon everyone thank you to the<br>chancellor the right honourable james<br>bulger<br>and the vice chancellor professor neil<br>quigley as well as the senior deputy<br>vice chancellor for providing me with<br>the opportunity<br>to speak today on behalf of the<br>graduates who just became graduates<br>welcome to today's esteemed guests<br>faculty members<br>and of course all of the family friends<br>and supporters<br>who have taken the time to come along<br>today don't worry i'll keep this brief<br>i'm sure we're all ready to go out and<br>celebrate but before we do<br>on behalf of the graduating class i<br>would like to extend<br>my sincere thanks to all of the people<br>who have assisted us on our journeys<br>personally i would like to thank the<br>staff of the law faculty<br>the faculty of arts and social sciences<br>the team who supported the hillary<br>scholars<br>and especially the mentor to the theatre<br>scholars gay pool<br>and of course the biggest thanks to my<br>parents who are basically the best<br>parents out<br>and who have been my biggest supporters<br>mum<br>i would also like to take this<br>opportunity to acknowledge matthew dixon<br>who passed away recently<br>he was an important part of te peringa<br>and i'm sure an important part of the<br>journey of all of the law graduates here<br>today<br>when i was asked if i would like to<br>speak today i was very relieved that the<br>university reassured me<br>that i didn't need to be obliged to say<br>anything wise<br>i don't think i'm in a position to be<br>offering any profound life advice<br>i definitely don't feel that i've<br>managed to clock the role of responsible<br>adult yet<br>given that i still feel successful if i<br>make it through a week without having<br>cereal for dinner<br>but although i may not feel that i've<br>achieved the title of<br>proper adult i realized that i am a<br>fundamentally different<br>and hopefully better person than when i<br>came to the university of waikato five<br>years ago<br>and i think that regardless of whether<br>you are graduating today with a bachelor<br>of teaching<br>a bachelor of laws a postgraduate degree<br>or a diploma<br>whether this is your first degree or if<br>you are returning to study<br>if you consider the things you knew<br>before you came to the university<br>and things you know now you'll find this<br>time has taught you a lot<br>and i don't mean the things you've<br>studied although i'm sure you learned<br>something about<br>education or the law bonus points if you<br>still remember it<br>i mean the life lessons especially the<br>ones that might not have seemed that<br>important at the time<br>sure i can tell you the elements of the<br>claim and negligence what gay morgan's<br>three<br>humps of government are or the<br>legislative history of the animal<br>welfare act 1999<br>but i also know how quickly i can write<br>3000 words under pressure<br>how long i can go without sleep and<br>conversely<br>how to nap anywhere at any time<br>and i think that these things might be<br>just as important<br>maybe you won't write them on your cv<br>but they shape the person you are<br>the way you approach life and the things<br>the university of waikato has been for<br>me at least<br>a fantastic environment for making these<br>discoveries<br>the great thing about university is that<br>there are opportunities<br>everywhere to join clubs to enter<br>competitions to meet people<br>everything is open i was fortunate<br>enough to be able to go on exchange for<br>a portion of my last year of study<br>and it was the best experience of my<br>life but there was a moment<br>as i was wheeling my two suitcases in<br>the rain over cobbles<br>to a street with a name i couldn't<br>pronounce to my flat that i had never<br>seen<br>in a city where i knew no one and i<br>thought to myself<br>natalie what have you done but what<br>followed that moment of panic<br>was without a doubt the best few months<br>of my life so the life lesson i learned<br>in that moment<br>which may not be profound or<br>particularly wise is that when i do<br>something that makes me<br>question myself in third person what<br>follows could be amazing<br>or it could be terrible but we'll leave<br>now that we have left university if<br>you're not staying here for another<br>round of course<br>the opportunities might not be so easy<br>to find<br>they won't come in the faculty's weekly<br>newsletter or be advertised at the<br>beginning of lectures<br>but i hope the opportunities that lead<br>to these seemingly insignificant life<br>lessons still exist<br>we might just need to look a bit harder<br>for them<br>congratulations fellow graduates not<br>only have you graduated<br>but you've crossed the stage without<br>tripping thank you<br>thank you natalie and thank you to all<br>the graduates<br>and their families friends and<br>supporters who've attended this<br>graduation ceremony this afternoon<br>as i said earlier today the graduates<br>have been admitted to the community of<br>scholars<br>of
