the<br>session on positive interviews I'm times<br>in Kingston career development advisor<br>here in the business school and this is<br>Peter who is the career development<br>manager here at the business school so<br>welcome i hope from i hope you gained a<br>lot out of this evening and thank you<br>for coming out on West I'm not a<br>particularly nice night so this evening<br>we'll be covering the 4 p's of<br>interviewing preparation practice<br>performance and positivity will be<br>giving you some tips on preparation and<br>how to promote your brand I'm going to<br>be teaching you a bit about learning how<br>to think like an interviewer because<br>then you've got some sort of inside<br>knowledge on how they might be I'm going<br>to treat you in the interview some<br>different types of interviews the<br>different ways that you can be assists<br>at an interview and also interviews and<br>recruitment trends and we will get be<br>getting you to do a practical activity<br>during the session as well so without<br>further ado I think we'll click off so<br>whoever's at the interview it's um it's<br>not just all about you it's about the<br>employer as well so the employer wants<br>to see whether you meet the requirements<br>they want to get sort of evidence of<br>your skills and ability you've said all<br>that stuff on your own on your CV and<br>your calves aletta but the proof can<br>sometimes be in the pudding when they've<br>actually got you in front of them and<br>they're also assessing you for fit<br>within their team and so they're they're<br>thinking okay is this person going to<br>work well well more than their team so<br>there's a whole lot a lot of different<br>things that an employer is blocking it<br>you well for you you're wanting to make<br>a great impression not just a good<br>impression a fantastic impression and<br>fit you're wanting to persuade them that<br>you meet all the requirements and it's<br>also your opportunity to find out more<br>about the job and the employer an<br>interview is a two-way process and and<br>it's the probably one of the only<br>chances you're going to get to find out<br>what it's like to be working with them<br>there<br>organization research is a great thing<br>and internetting those sorts of things<br>but being face to face with them as even<br>better<br>so different types of interviews these<br>IAM is the traditional face-to-face of<br>course in more and more now there's a.m.<br>there's a trend towards telephone<br>interviewing and one of the really<br>really important things if you're going<br>to have your cell phone on there as a<br>contact for telephone interviewing is to<br>actually listen to your cell phone<br>message is that the sort of message that<br>you want to convey to an employer<br>because a message like hello hello hello<br>there leave message is not going to<br>inveigh the right message to them to an<br>employer so so even if it's only during<br>the time that you're trying to UM to be<br>employed think really seriously about<br>what that message says about you you<br>might want to change it for that period<br>visually humorous to that new idea<br>absolutely yes you want to but come<br>across as a professional person and<br>think about it if it was a work camp<br>cell phone you wouldn't leave a humorous<br>message or a smart message or a silly<br>message on that or a message that's just<br>music you'd leave a professional message<br>on there we have had feedback from<br>employers where they phoned up and<br>they've going to they were going to<br>invite someone to an interview but<br>because of the message on the phone they<br>just put them in the bin so they do<br>there's also an increasing use of video<br>interviewing and skype and that could be<br>a video interviewing where you you<br>record a video message or it could be<br>using skype actually live<br>interaction with them with the video it<br>might be that they ask a series of<br>questions they might get you to do a<br>presentation they might get you to do<br>since I don't know sell a glass of wine<br>to me something like that so there's a<br>lot of different things that they might<br>get you to do online and you'd usually<br>have a bit of warning so you can prepare<br>for that I'm here usually what here but<br>not always not always don't forget that<br>there might be different numbers of<br>people like that at that interview too<br>it might be just one interviewer or<br>there might be a panel and sometimes a<br>pen or can can throw people if they're<br>thinking it's just going to be a<br>one-on-one interview the most people<br>I've ever had was five I knew it was<br>going to happen but still it was<br>daunting how about you I think probably<br>five is my max I think government<br>departments hospital boards they tend to<br>have bigger panels and if you're going<br>for an academic role you might expect<br>nine or ten not sure why anyone here<br>wanted to go for an academic role he's<br>of no Nate Ardennes interview where<br>there was about 50 people not only for<br>the presentation but also for your Q&amp;A<br>session so which is a kind of interview<br>so I'm so yes yep and think it's could<br>be different levels of formality in the<br>interview as well once upon a time it<br>was usually going to be a really formal<br>process but now it's not uncommon for<br>people to actually say like well it's<br>ever have a cup of coffee I've got a job<br>through a coffee interview with there<br>was no formal interview at all how about<br>you Peter of you I'll get their form and<br>the coffee let's just meet Frechette and<br>it turned into a proper interview which<br>I wasn't expecting so even if they do<br>say it's informal if they say it's for a<br>cup of coffee expect it to be a formal<br>interview just in case prepare like you<br>would for a formal interview if it is a<br>coffee meeting I actually think they're<br>the most dangerous type because you can<br>relax too much<br>especially if you're getting on really<br>well with the person you can relax you<br>can say things that you wouldn't<br>normally say if it was a formal<br>interview you're in an interview room so<br>you need to be careful about those<br>informal ones and yeah I fell into that<br>pit for months it didn't lose me the<br>opportunity i went and one went on to a<br>formal interview afterwards but i<br>thought and sort of you born as a formed<br>as for armed as far as soon I've never<br>done that again yeah with the phone<br>interview one trick is to smile because<br>it actually makes your voice sound<br>warmer on the phone and some people<br>actually stand up when they're on the<br>telephone but they seem to think that it<br>helps as well so you must look we've<br>covered all the types of interviews but<br>now there's more so there's case<br>interviews and a case Christians don't<br>defer to you Peter because I don't know<br>so much about though okay so case<br>interview so if it's a consultancy<br>company and might just be a case<br>interview and that's all you get so<br>you'll get a case so particular company<br>wants to sell more of a particular brand<br>of ice cream you're given the<br>information you need and then throughout<br>the interview you work through that<br>problem you're thinking out loud that's<br>the trick with a case interview so when<br>you're actually you've got an interview<br>interviewer there with you and be there<br>to hear what your your thought process<br>and they might actually give you some<br>help as well so if they say things you<br>need to listen to what they're actually<br>saying because they might be giving you<br>hints so it's a particular case some<br>consultancy companies that might be<br>three case interviews in a row even more<br>so it is really grueling so that's a lot<br>of the graduates who are going for<br>consultancy companies go through that<br>process the companies like bein or ally<br>kay but it's not unusual now for<br>employers and an regular sort of<br>interview to throw in a case question so<br>it's the same thing we've got this<br>particular issue how would you solve it<br>so they'll give you the information you<br>need and then you work through the<br>process to solve it but of course it<br>will be sort of like way shorter than<br>the other example i gave the trick is to<br>as i said think out loud let them know<br>what your thought processes it's not<br>necessarily that you come up with the<br>right answer they might not be a right<br>answer they just want to know how you<br>think how you solve problems and again<br>that would be about team fitts<br>organization fetch won't it in a lot of<br>cases its roles where you'll be<br>client-facing so they want to know that<br>they can put you in front of a client<br>the client has an issue you'll be able<br>to sort of talk to them about how to go<br>through and solve it there's also lunch<br>dinner and drinks type interviews and<br>with those it's that it's all about how<br>you present yourself how you fit in a<br>social situation because for certain<br>organizations part of your role may be<br>taking people out and and they want to<br>know that you won't drink to excess that<br>you that you will know how to cope with<br>them if there's six different knives and<br>forks you won't think oh my god panic<br>panic so it's over it's all about that<br>and also during that they may be asking<br>you questions that you require some<br>quite intense thought to answer as well<br>so it's not all going to be relaxation<br>usually at those sorts of things it<br>could just be something basic is you're<br>not the sort of person he drops you know<br>the sausage roll pastry on the floor<br>just things like that work sample<br>interviews as where they might ask you<br>to show samples of your work a portfolio<br>you've done and or to demonstrate your<br>skills for a lecturer at might they<br>might ask you to give a short lecture on<br>a topic of your choosing for a designer<br>you might have to learn to show design<br>for someone an IT yeah you might be able<br>to show them a program that you've<br>designed or or an app that you've<br>designed<br>a situational interview that's that's<br>really papa sort of sitting out a<br>situation and then asking you how you<br>would have handled that situation or<br>what you would have done known under a<br>particular set of servants circumstances<br>it's summer similar to behavioral but<br>it's going to be a hypothetical question<br>so so it can be easier and harder than a<br>behavioral question because you're<br>really having to think on your feet<br>about how you would cope with it and<br>that's why they ask it it's put you<br>under pressure so online interviews as<br>research this a lot more online<br>interviews happening now so it's really<br>wise to be ready for that choosing the<br>right vacation really really important<br>you don't want to be in a cafe with lots<br>of noise in the background so find<br>yourself a nice quiet place with good<br>lighting and preferably a plane wall as<br>your backdrop not might not be possible<br>and make sure that you're seeing on the<br>camera from about the the waist up that<br>you don't want them just to be sort of<br>seeing your face can't accentuate this<br>enough test all the technology the<br>number of times that people get caught<br>by this because they get into the room<br>two minutes beforehand and start to sit<br>get things set up the technology is not<br>working and so you can't actually hold<br>the interview so test the connection<br>test you can write tests you sound and<br>and make sure that you understand how it<br>all works prep do a practice some run<br>with a friend beforehand if necessary<br>and plan for glitches because sometimes<br>something will go wrong and something<br>you can't predict that the connection<br>might go wrong so have the person's<br>contact details for the who's<br>interviewing you for example so you can<br>ring them and say look I've just think<br>something's not working and I'm working<br>on it so they're not sitting the other<br>end thinking okay what's going on here<br>or that you've forgotten or something<br>like that and sometimes things can<br>happen at the end as well so have a<br>backup so that you can find them and<br>just do a phone interview of your sister<br>yeah another thing to test is in terms<br>of what you're going to wear how it<br>looks so I know someone he agonized over<br>what tie looked best on the video<br>interview was he was here in the<br>business school we were up in the clock<br>tower and we was giving him advice as to<br>which tie looked better because actually<br>with some connections at I that's really<br>bright can actually look quite quite<br>wrong counter yeah and think about<br>what's in the background as well and<br>whether the background is appropriate if<br>you're doing it at home pits family<br>members and not allowed to come into the<br>room when you're actually doing it that<br>happens yes and also on anything like<br>phones and all those sorts of things<br>they said turn everything off before the<br>interview starts except your computer of<br>course as anything that might interrupt<br>the interview and make sure on your<br>computer that there's nothing there I'm<br>sure you've all heard interviews on the<br>radio where they've had their mails<br>coming through and so there's this Bing<br>Bing Bing all through it which is really<br>really disturbing if you're trying to<br>actually concentrate on something like<br>that dress professionally nothing too<br>flashy but but something that looks<br>looks right for the organization and<br>yeah look look at yourself from the<br>monitor and see how you look sometimes<br>you might want to move the computer<br>around a bit so you get up your best<br>side and things like that huge recipient<br>of you peasant some absolutely brief<br>occasional culture<br>suit of casual cultural organization<br>yeah yeah you always need to think about<br>the organization maybe dress and notch<br>above what they would normally wear in a<br>day-to-day basis because it is an<br>interview but I have a friend he went<br>for an interview at the warehouse it was<br>for an HR role and he Wars corporate<br>search and then that interviewers were<br>wearing warehouse Richards and I don't<br>think he didn't get the job because of<br>that but I think it might have put him<br>off balance because he kept talking<br>about it later uh-huh so it affected his<br>performance now don't forget to run on<br>verbals even though it might be an<br>online interview you've still got to<br>meet people's eyes you've got to do all<br>those those those nonverbal activities<br>nodding smiling etc because your trots<br>still trying to engage them although<br>it's through a screen you're still<br>trying to engage them look directly at<br>the camera yeah because it sometimes<br>that can on if you're looking like that<br>or that can muck up your performance as<br>well speaking of conversational voice<br>and buy it buy that every weed don't<br>don't sound as though you're incredibly<br>stressed just just speak to learn in a<br>relaxed manner and it's okay to take<br>notes but will you be being interviewed<br>about spending all your time looking<br>down like that because it's then it's<br>going to be obvious that you've got<br>extensive notes and that could put an<br>interviewer off as well and and that's<br>what not least like an ordinary<br>interview it's okay to take a second<br>before you are before you answer I know<br>interviewers that are actually put off<br>by people who the second they stop them<br>the question are under the answer so<br>it's then taking just a moment suggests<br>that you're actually thinking about it<br>rather than having a pre-prepared answer<br>and not having really thought about the<br>question and just like sometimes on the<br>phone you can get that delay so you need<br>to pause to make sure that they aren't<br>still talking you know how sometimes you<br>are on an overseas call and you get that<br>horrible delay and you talk over each<br>other so it's a good idea just to pause<br>just in case<br>so you get that and you do often get<br>that with skype don't you yeah okay one<br>of our big peas preparation now<br>different people will prepare in<br>different ways and this is it here a<br>great way of preparing is thinking about<br>all the things that you need to do and<br>perhaps putting them on a mind map but<br>if that doesn't that doesn't work for<br>you just just thinking about all the<br>stages of the interview in what done and<br>what might be useful so we're going to<br>go a bit further into the old<br>preparation because it's so vital so the<br>nuts and bolts ask who are the<br>interviewers and ask how long the<br>interview will last for there's nothing<br>worse than going in and thinking it's<br>going to be a half-hour interview and it<br>turns into a two-hour interview you've<br>got other things that you should be<br>doing and you're thinking oh my god so<br>and so should be picked up from<br>childcare panic panic because that's<br>going to affect your performance so so<br>to do that the who the interviewers are<br>that can help you too because you might<br>then adapt your performance some<br>depending on who's who's interviewing<br>you and where the interview will take<br>place that may seem seem really obvious<br>but and you talked about something to me<br>is being say on the 10th floor of a<br>building if you don't know that it's<br>nothing to be in the 10th floor of the<br>building you might not think ah 10th<br>floor there may be a few steps to me<br>getting to the 10th floor so i'll arrive<br>there 20 minutes before rather than 10<br>minutes before so so so the where is<br>really important so some buildings have<br>you know you've got to sign in and that<br>can take time often it's on you've got<br>the silly keyboard and it won't work and<br>yeah it's I think it's Auckland Auckland<br>Council it took me forever because there<br>was a queue as well so it just took us<br>forever to get through the process hope<br>no one here is from Auckland Council<br>look you say had a similar<br>yeah it was a big group of us waiting is<br>good no and there are some buildings<br>where you know you put in who you're<br>going to see and then it tells you what<br>elevator got to go to and then you're<br>standing there forever so there's those<br>sorts of issues I had an interview want<br>some great south road and I don't know<br>what it is about that road but i always<br>get lost so I'm the weekend I actually<br>drove and figured out where it actually<br>was so that wouldn't happen so and I<br>know someone she had an interview on<br>Queen Street and so that's fine but what<br>she didn't realize it was upper queen<br>street so by the time she got there she<br>was out of breath and quite hot and she<br>looked at so it's just silly things like<br>that I guess it really is really the<br>sort of a radial to go than the day<br>before as I know that could have done<br>the final equation is right the topping<br>is not the edge at the BRIT amount ebook<br>if you knock another one yes so you<br>could do Google Maps these days does<br>help a bit but you could always do a<br>Ricky if you needed to as I see a great<br>South Road look how long letters which<br>is probably why I get lost on these<br>there's a weird fork thing as well but<br>yes so if you're worried about it you<br>could do a Ricky I but these don't don't<br>totally rely on that Ricky I I am I had<br>an interview here at the clock tower and<br>thought great these parking outside so<br>if I arrived about 15 minutes earlier<br>but I'll be fine I need to discover that<br>all the packing outside all along that<br>street that was closed and so then I had<br>to go and find another parking building<br>and I arrived there flashed a face<br>slightly other breathe because I'd had<br>to come up sort of a 10 minute walk in<br>about three minutes so say here so even<br>with the Ricky I'd still arrive in the<br>area plenty of time before he and use a<br>lot of these things they should tell you<br>but if they don't ask and you can ask<br>them what sort of interview it is as<br>well they may or may not tell you but it<br>doesn't hurt to ask indeed with the who<br>the interviewers are you can actually do<br>some research as well as you can google<br>check on linkedin and it might help you<br>with questions that you can ask and they<br>interview indeed now don't forget that<br>they are going to have all they're going<br>to have looked at as your CV in your<br>application but they probably are going<br>to ask your questions based around there<br>so make sure that you know that off by<br>heart even have it there with you and in<br>practice talking about the things that<br>you've done and that you've mentioned in<br>there it's likely work experience and<br>your extracurricular activities on the<br>amazing things that you've done and to<br>succeed and a new activities so really<br>important that you know that well<br>because that can show up if you're<br>telling a different story that your CV<br>did you can take things into the<br>interview with you if you want a clear<br>file is quite a good idea because then<br>like you can have the most important<br>page on the top i don't think i think i<br>have taken stuff into the interview I<br>don't think I've ever actually referred<br>to it myself you've taken stuff and I<br>always is i always take stuff into that<br>into the interview the only thing I've<br>ever referred to as Christians at the<br>end I have to say'll never actually<br>looked at my CV during the interview but<br>another important thing is really<br>analyze the job descrip description<br>because buying by doing this you're able<br>to actually anticipate the sorts of<br>questions that they might ask and then<br>prepare examples of how you might answer<br>those questions and and so yes here is a<br>Christian around relationship management<br>so I think ok if this they're asking did<br>have how you might demonstrate a high<br>level of interpersonal skills think<br>about a situation when you've done that<br>so you're saying you're real prepared<br>and you're not on the hop and thinking<br>oh my god I can't remember so it's I<br>really look at that job description<br>because it's going to give you a lot of<br>clues as to sort the sort of preparation<br>also research the organization and the<br>job with the organization look at their<br>website look at industry websites look<br>at journals look at John the networks<br>that they have look at the look at the<br>Herald and though that those sorts of<br>things CC if there's anything in there<br>that might give you some clues because<br>that can give you some information on<br>why you want to work at the UM the<br>organization it can also give you<br>questions to ask at the end and just<br>prompt on property to think about the<br>organization as an entirety and then<br>also look at the industry what's the<br>future trends what I hope what are the<br>competitors was that that may also<br>inform you as to whether you want to go<br>into that industry might on tip because<br>if it's an industry on the downturn you<br>may think no I'd rather have one that's<br>on the up to it and it might help you<br>with questions as well in terms of how<br>you frame your answers that might help<br>you there and it can you can show that<br>you've done your research but also if<br>they ask your question about who do you<br>think our main competitors are you'll be<br>able to answer and then look at the the<br>job what is the job what will you be<br>doing in their job preps go on to<br>something like seek and see what other<br>jobs like that talk about so get<br>yourself a bit more informed about that<br>again can prompt you to ask questions<br>and at the end of the interview if<br>you're not clear about that and really<br>this could all help you to answer that<br>question why do you want this job so<br>prepare to make a really good first<br>impression I but with what you wear with<br>the handshake no limp and shakes a nice<br>firm handshake but also don't rupture<br>the blood vessels in the person's hands<br>that you're shaking cause I'm sure that<br>we've all had those and gone ah<br>afterwards so don't do that either and<br>the problem as you might be nervous<br>which means you might have damp palms as<br>well handshakes are just really fraught<br>really so don't make it obvious you know<br>sort of they come up to you and you're<br>doing that before you shake their head<br>yes I know someone who puts a<br>handkerchief in his pocket because he<br>has really sweetie comms so he has that<br>handkerchief and just before the<br>interview he always makes sure that his<br>his head his hand in his pocket so it<br>comes out nice and dry so it's all list<br>of all this preparation how many of you<br>like shaking hands how many don't like<br>shaking hands yeah so if you don't like<br>it you could wait for the employer to<br>initiate chances are they probably will<br>but you don't have to initiate it if you<br>don't want to you can always wait but<br>then you've got the problem of your<br>watching their hand to see if you're<br>going to put their hand out or not so<br>you can't win but not all employers will<br>shake hands but a lot of them a lot of<br>them well I think you lots o most<br>actually yeah um but if you're<br>comfortable doing it you can always<br>initiate it yourself but is while you're<br>doing that try to also maintain eye<br>contact is this a difficult but maintain<br>that I can't contact and that's right<br>through the the whole interview make<br>sure that your tone of voice is right<br>don't don't shout but also don't speak<br>so so no one can actually hear what<br>you're saying so try and get a nice tone<br>of voice also your tone of voice<br>sometimes you can sound us are you're<br>lecturing people no one likes to be<br>lectured so I'm so just a more<br>conversational tone as the best and<br>posture really important during an<br>interview that you are that you maintain<br>a friendly and approachable posture but<br>not one that seems too aggressive or too<br>laid back because sometimes you can give<br>completely the wrong impression by your<br>posture you've probably noticed Tim's<br>and and I both talk with our hands when<br>it comes to an interview mannerisms like<br>that get worse because you're nervous so<br>I've been in an interview and I've been<br>like a winmo already there was one where<br>there was a round table and I was<br>talking about walking down the road and<br>I was actually walking my fingers along<br>the table that's when I realized I was<br>totally out of control so because it was<br>around table actually sat on my hands<br>and they couldn't see that years if<br>you've got mannerisms like there you<br>might sort of play with your earrings if<br>you wear them or play with your ears<br>things like they're so just watch those<br>sorts of mannerism<br>yes well pen clicking yeah don't hold a<br>clicky pen cuz that's very easy to do<br>yeah i actually had wasn't an interview<br>with someone had to stop the person<br>doing that because they were completely<br>unaware that they were doing it but is i<br>have my interview position i I put my<br>hands in my leg like that because these<br>otherwise I can get all of it be a<br>windmill II yes okay one of the crucial<br>bits but all these boots are crucial as<br>the as the good ol dumb questions open<br>questions the aim of these is to make<br>sure that you do as much of the talking<br>as possible and then and then they get<br>that good old chestnut to tell me about<br>yourself why have you applied for this<br>role it's surprising how many people get<br>thrown by those so so make sure that you<br>have those those answers prepared not<br>the site that you want to save them by<br>rote but that you've got the prepared so<br>you can you feel comfortable about<br>seeing them and they're really difficult<br>if you haven't prepared them it's an<br>opportunity for you to sell yourself so<br>use that opportunity outline a clear<br>structure for each and here identify<br>what your achievements are and offer<br>specific examples to back it up it's<br>kind of proof that you've actually but<br>you actually have done what you're<br>talking about and practice your answers<br>aloud to check your timing your clarity<br>and your tone of voice practice with<br>with others that that's really useful<br>because they can say if you would be<br>competency-based christians these these<br>these can be really tricky to and<br>examples of those are at a time when you<br>anticipated potential problems and<br>developed preventive measures they're<br>wanting to know more about what you have<br>done and and how you have done it look<br>at the competencies that they have asked<br>for because they're probably going to<br>ask your questions about that so again<br>it's sort of preparing making yourself<br>feel comfortable about answering those<br>choose the most impressive examples that<br>you've got to demonstrate each<br>competency because you want to you want<br>to shine you want to be a star in their<br>eyes so so you sometimes you might have<br>to to mention a second example of it but<br>if you've got a couple this one should<br>be the most impressive one and yet as<br>the video said you star to help you the<br>structure can can help you to to answer<br>the question and be clear about is each<br>aspect of the question and yeah I've to<br>also found that a lot of people focus on<br>the situation and the result but forget<br>about the task and action aspects of it<br>and if you do that then then the<br>difficulty is that they don't know<br>exactly what you did to make that result<br>so probably about sixty percent of your<br>time should be on that action portion of<br>it and if it's a team question our<br>tendency is to say that we did this we<br>did that we did the other and you can<br>say that sometimes but it's particularly<br>when it comes to the action you want to<br>focus on what you did so it is ok to say<br>I did this my contribution to the team<br>was so it is very easy to just talk<br>about we all the time when it's a team<br>question hmm yeah and they're not listen<br>to viewing the team they're interviewing<br>you that's the thing to keep in mind<br>isn't it<br>so yet situation task action result<br>really keep those in mind you don't have<br>to write these down because we'll be<br>sending out them the slides to you so<br>don't don't worry about that but you<br>really do think about these when you are<br>when you're structuring your answers and<br>practicing them with the result one if<br>they ask you a negative question so tell<br>me about a time when you had a poor<br>performing team what was the problem<br>what you can do with that is actually<br>talk about what you learn from the<br>experience that will be the result sort<br>of what you learned and what you would<br>do differently next time okay now we're<br>going to get you into groups of three to<br>actually answer these three questions so<br>tell us a bit about yourself tell us<br>about a time when you worked<br>successfully in a team and give us an<br>example of a time when you've studied<br>and whipped and just circumstances that<br>were unusual or different now it was<br>going to be about 10 minutes so you will<br>have to be very structured in your<br>answers use using star so three minutes<br>on each question so each of you will<br>have one minute to answer the question<br>you can get once you can get yourself<br>from set up at the table if you like<br>we're one of you is sort of in an<br>interviewer type position but yes if you<br>can get into groups of three and an<br>answer these questions and we'll have<br>about two or three minutes of discussion<br>bidding<br>okay if we can wrap the exercise up now<br>and we're just going to give you a few<br>few examples the sort of things that you<br>could have said to show you how if you<br>prepared this how you have success<br>statements that actually answer the the<br>exact questions so so here we are here<br>are an example of how to best answer<br>this question for experienced candidates<br>I've worked hard in my education and<br>career to prepare myself to become a<br>world class accountant received my<br>battery of Commerce majoring in<br>accounting for the University of<br>Auckland and then went to work for KPMG<br>after graduation pass the CPA exam on my<br>first try and progress well in my career<br>rah rah rah so it's it's actually it's<br>succinct but there's a heck of a lot of<br>information and there isn't there and<br>you can see how if you prepared that how<br>much easier it would be then then get<br>going in and and the thinking of it on<br>the spot and sorry sorry it's tailored<br>very much for the specific job you can<br>put in some other information as well<br>you don't have to keep it strictly that<br>are professional if there's something in<br>your personal life some extracurricular<br>activity you can put that in there as<br>well it just depends on what relates to<br>the job it depends on the organization<br>and the industry as well and again he's<br>an example of working in a team you're<br>going to get these these slides so I<br>won't read that out for you but it<br>really goes through every aspect of what<br>the person has done in the team when<br>you're talking about a team it's<br>important to say how many were in the<br>team so in this case it's a team of age<br>so if you just talk about team that<br>could mean anything from two of you two<br>yeah who knows so you do need to<br>quantify wherever you can give numbers<br>and I saw you wrong too yeah well your<br>role is yeah and then once again you've<br>done your research you know what they're<br>looking for so then in your answer you<br>let me to heaven yeah so what might help<br>you is if you actually know what your<br>role is in a team we naturally tend to<br>have a particular role one of them<br>obviously is leader even if you're not<br>formally the leader you might just<br>naturally be inclined that way or you<br>might be the summarizer you know the<br>calm person the one that summarizes and<br>clarifies what's what's being said in a<br>meeting for example you might be the one<br>that makes sure that everyone gets a<br>chance to have a say you will actually<br>naturally have probably a combination of<br>some of these and knowing what your<br>tendency is can help you when it comes<br>to answer the team questions employers a<br>lot of the time will actually have some<br>sort of marking sheet not everyone and<br>it's more so the larger organizations<br>almost always would small organizations<br>may or may not but they'll have some<br>sort of marking criteria and then that<br>way they'll be able to judge you against<br>the next person against the next person<br>etc so for this particular question when<br>you studied worked in circumstances that<br>for you were unusual or different what<br>they would be looking for are these<br>sorts of things that be basically giving<br>you a score it might be from zero to<br>five or three so three strong evidence<br>of each criteria vanted it really well<br>very thoroughly given examples<br>quantified some criteria some evidence<br>maybe two and then limited evidence you<br>might just get a one the one thing to<br>remember about this is when you're in<br>the interview and you know how sometimes<br>you feel like oh no I really didn't<br>answer that very well you don't know how<br>important that particular question is so<br>often they wait these things so one<br>question might be more important than<br>another question so you don't want to<br>let it sort of if you get the sense that<br>you didn't answer it very well don't let<br>it put you off because you don't know<br>how important that particular question<br>was<br>but it is important really you can to<br>give the sort of evidence and proof and<br>back up your answers and what if you<br>don't know the answer we've all had<br>those oh my god moments don't Bluff<br>don't lie take a sip of water you can<br>ask her the question to be repeated or<br>ask for clarification or ask for time to<br>consider the answer and then put the<br>skids part of the sort of the testing<br>nature of interviews because how you<br>respond in a difficult situation is<br>important usually by the end of a moment<br>or so you'll have found some sort of<br>answer within yourself sometimes I'll<br>just ask you a question just to see how<br>you cope one that was going around a few<br>it took an engineering student to give<br>me the actual answer to that but sort of<br>a lot of people would not know so it's<br>how you cope with a question that you<br>really don't know the answer to yeah<br>that would through me yeah it's so if<br>it's round account full throw if it was<br>square if the hole was square it could<br>fall through oh there you go so now you<br>know if you get that one it's really<br>good to have some questions to ask the<br>interviewer as well it's your chance to<br>find out more about the role and whether<br>it's the right fit for you gives you a<br>chance to demonstrate that you're really<br>interested in the employer that you've<br>done your research on them and that you<br>know about the organization because that<br>will impress them so root that's really<br>important you can find out about the<br>interviewers experiences so you can ask<br>them you know what's a day in the life<br>of the the role that you're going for<br>something like that or you can ask them<br>what their experiences and also it gives<br>you an opportunity to ensure that the<br>interviewer doesn't have any<br>reservations about you as a as an<br>interviewee<br>and some typical questions you might ask<br>this typical day in the role is there an<br>induction and training program can you<br>tell me about the team i'll be working<br>with what do you most enjoy about<br>working here so that all those sorts of<br>things can can build up your information<br>on the role on the team and the owner on<br>the organization and also that astral<br>what's the next step in the process<br>really useful to know that if they say<br>we'll let you know within a couple of<br>days then you'll know within a week or<br>so if you haven't heard from them that<br>you might want to contact them back so<br>I'm so that you get some some knowledge<br>of that that that berm those steps in<br>the process they might also say well we<br>have a second interview so then you're<br>prepared if they invite you in for a<br>second interview really rather useful<br>for you to send a thank-you email after<br>an interview it's polite but it also it<br>gives you a chance to remind them who<br>you are there might be something in the<br>interview that you thought all that<br>didn't go so well you can just insert a<br>little bit that um that you've thought<br>of afterwards enter the email don't want<br>it to be too long but it's an<br>opportunity to sell yourself a little<br>bit more and it also can remind you it<br>remind them that yes they actually have<br>to get back to the people that they've<br>interviewed because sometimes in busy<br>organizations they're not so good at<br>that a lot of people make sure let me by<br>first name or title mr. Smith or Jones<br>all yeah pass it depends it depends on<br>you it depends on the organization as<br>you were saying before if it's more of a<br>informal type of organization you might<br>go with first name I think it's if<br>you're not sure I think it's safest to<br>go for more and go with dear mr. Smith I<br>don't think too many people get upset if<br>you did dear mr. Smith whereas there are<br>some people who would if you see a deer<br>Joe they might get upset if in doubt I<br>would yeah but it depends on your age it<br>depends on the age of the interviewers<br>but you might not know if you got my<br>mother and you see a deer noring she<br>throwing around in the bin at the moment<br>so you just don't know so yeah I would<br>err on the side of conservative<br>sometimes if you've met that person<br>several times then you that that might<br>make you think oh we've actually<br>established a relationship so it would<br>be okay but I'd also have you on the<br>side of conservatism because there are a<br>see it practice and preparation makes<br>perfect it's a skill that you can<br>develop really important that you<br>research the role in the organization<br>analyze the Job Description think of<br>examples practice practice practice<br>practice practice and after the<br>interview reflect on how how it went<br>what did you do well what could you have<br>done better now one of our questions was<br>with regard to feedback and whether it's<br>okay to ask for feedback yes that's fine<br>to ask for feedback you can do that in<br>the am I follow up follow up email or<br>you've when they call you or email you<br>to say that you have haven't been chosen<br>you can you can do that and that<br>sometimes they won't give you feedback<br>but sometimes they'll give you quite<br>good feedback and that's then you can<br>actually utilize that feedback and your<br>preparation for the future now we had a<br>few other questions that then come up<br>and one was some older applicants at a<br>disadvantage when they've got a young<br>interviewer we were discussing that and<br>our perception as perhaps that might<br>have been the case in the past but now<br>there are more and more older applicants<br>choosing to work longer and there is a<br>diminishing pool of young applicants<br>then I don't think that that would be<br>the case I think that people will treat<br>you on on at face value I wonder one<br>really really tricky question as how to<br>cope with constant rejection and it's<br>going to happen I don't know anyone who<br>applied and got the first job that they<br>apply<br>for do know everyone gets rejection this<br>is you might get 50 you might get a<br>hundred you might have applied for a job<br>us like a the internships that come up<br>where there might be five thousand<br>applicants for those internships so so a<br>lot of awful lot of those people are<br>going to be rejected and it's how you<br>actually manage that rejection one way<br>is to realize that it's not personal<br>that there is just someone who was a<br>better fit for the organization well is<br>to get that feedback and and work on<br>areas of weakness once to look at what<br>stage the rejection was so was it adn't<br>of you or did you not even get to the<br>interview because we didn't get to the<br>interview perhaps it's the the CV the<br>cover letter or the application that<br>for you is okay captain here in one<br>works I think in many cases they will be<br>engine electrical some firms they're<br>also I think they must they must<br>advertisers in many cases that they'll<br>have someone lined up at the job an<br>internet site after reading is really a<br>great much benefit they were normal time<br>to see they just go to the emotions you<br>know normal normally that the laying in<br>public server manager bagan big uous job<br>might be yeah this blue chip<br>organization is looking for someone<br>else's radishes of challenge accepted<br>who doesn't one clue might be that if<br>it's only on for a short period of time<br>select five days that might be a clue<br>that they've got an internal applicant<br>as well if you target your applications<br>so rather than do a scattergun and apply<br>to a whole lot of different<br>organizations if you actually do do the<br>research and target it and think about<br>who you're applying and taylor every<br>single application that should increase<br>your hood rate yeah exactly so be a bit<br>strategic yeah i'm going back to the<br>older applicant question we have had<br>sort of feedback from because because we<br>deal with graduate students graduates we<br>have had feedback from employers that<br>they are getting more older people sort<br>of applying for say a graduate position<br>and going through a great program and<br>they don't have a problem with that<br>sometimes the applicant themselves can<br>feel a little bit uncomfortable up there<br>with a whole lot of younger people in<br>the grad program so that might be an<br>issue but from the employers point of<br>view they find older applicants to<br>actually have a lot to offer in terms of<br>value so that was good feedback to hear<br>he isn't I read an article about even<br>internships people that's doing career<br>changes and so they made of an<br>internship at 40 or 50 here so I think<br>it is a growing trend another question<br>was how do I prepare for an interview<br>the jobs in a different industry so<br>that's doing the research that's doing<br>informational interviews talking to<br>people in that industry and getting<br>feedback and information from them it's<br>all about preparation togethers and it's<br>all about preparation yeah ok and to<br>wrap up other things that you should<br>know is that about twenty-five percent<br>of employers get back to contended 'it's<br>within a week but 44 never respond at<br>all so you will never hear from them and<br>out to about two weeks and then follow<br>up or you may choose to decide that at<br>an organization that doesn't get back to<br>you is not one that you want a week for<br>at all but but sometimes i've been in<br>the situation where I've had to follow<br>up referees and it has taken me a long<br>time to do that so sometimes the<br>organization may just be going through<br>different processes and it may take them<br>a while yeah this is probably a trend in<br>terms of your never hearing about your<br>application at all ever probably a trend<br>I've noticed in the last three weeks<br>yeah three to five years I'm groove<br>observatories did you know that ok today<br>yeah yeah so you follow up yeah but yeah<br>you can follow up sort of just leave<br>maybe a couple of weeks and then contact<br>them you're able to do that and it shows<br>them trust as well and from your side so<br>don't worry about doing that I don't<br>know how many of you are familiar with<br>the Employment Relations website but<br>it's got a lot of really useful<br>information in there about job contracts<br>about your employment rights so it's<br>actually a really good website to sort<br>of check some of the stuff out and don't<br>forget you can refuse a job offer during<br>the interview process you have<br>interviewed them and you've done<br>that they are not for you it's okay to<br>say thanks but but I've decided that<br>just as you don't deputies really say<br>why you have to decide it you can just<br>say thanks but I've decided not to run<br>take off up this opportunity that's<br>perfectly okay as well so conscious that<br>we've gone over time sorry about there<br>but that is actually the info<br>presentation unless you've got some<br>questions some more questions okay thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
