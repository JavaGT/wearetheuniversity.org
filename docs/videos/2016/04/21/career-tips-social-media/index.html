0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in terms of what we're going to look at<br>is basically how we actually use social<br>media we will give you some statistics<br>then we'll also talk about personal<br>brand and do you all know that you've<br>got a personal brand yeah so it's a<br>relatively recent thing it takes some<br>people by surprise but obviously with<br>social media it has such an impact on<br>social branding so Facebook one point 49<br>billion YouTube a billion users four<br>billion views per your day so and what<br>do you guys got for disadvantages first<br>week of it off what do you guys think<br>Zoila for you distractions what do one<br>down that cyber bullying cyberbullying<br>yeah multitasking not really title aids<br>yeah I hear you yep yeah okay what about<br>benefits then one of the benefits of<br>social media that'll there things were<br>the great things in sheer ideas quickly<br>yeah and you can keep up and was<br>happening<br>right realtor you just as you're freezin<br>UK you totally so we had a few most of<br>those so can reduce privacy none of you<br>see it about the time I don't think it<br>can take up a lot of time the whole<br>personal and professional thing can<br>become really intertwined yeah it can<br>encourage informality which from a<br>personal branding point of view can be a<br>little bit tricky and information you<br>put some information on the Internet can<br>be so taken out of context and can be<br>really damaging so it's things like that<br>we've got to think about there is that<br>whole emotional connection and it can<br>decrease that and also communication<br>skills then of course you've got the<br>whole bullying then of course facebook<br>is selling your personal information so<br>then they can target those ads to you in<br>fact yeah it's not just Facebook a whole<br>lot of people are selling companies are<br>selling your personal information<br>forward identity theft one of that comes<br>into it but it does allow you to access<br>a community and if you do have people<br>that you want to keep in contact with<br>particularly people outs sort of outside<br>of Auckland it makes it so much easier<br>so there is an advantage that's the<br>whole social thing worldwide<br>connectivity people with common<br>interests so we do like to be with<br>people who are like us so it helps us<br>find our tribe if you like so that is a<br>really good thing about it and then the<br>whole personal brand and searching for a<br>job so you can be hit hunted justice<br>linkedin is an example so you can<br>actually find context on the air for<br>informational interviews so what was<br>that it was 380 million roughly on<br>linkedin but just university of auckland<br>alone these 80,000 165 plus so that's<br>current students alumni and staff so<br>that's a huge network and you can go on<br>to linkedin and you can actually see<br>where they work what they do and you can<br>drill down further so if you want to<br>know about a job for example<br>so you're thinking about changing<br>changing roles and you're not quite sure<br>what people do in that role you can go<br>on to LinkedIn you can identify someone<br>from the University of Auckland who may<br>be studied something similar to you you<br>can find out what they're doing you can<br>make a connection with them and ask if<br>you can do an informational interview so<br>you can go and talk to them about their<br>job because when you are trying to<br>connect with people it is good to find<br>sums something can common so I know<br>someone she was a law graduate so she<br>went through all the law firms through<br>the partners trying to find just one<br>thing at least in common so an example<br>she gave me was she found someone who<br>spoke French and she had just been in<br>France so when she contacted him she<br>used debtors who hook to get in and<br>coincidentally that was the firm she got<br>the job with this person has<br>brainstormed all the different things<br>that they are involved in interested in<br>so they've got linkedin they've got a<br>fan page on Facebook they've got Twitter<br>they've got a blog YouTube iTunes but<br>they've got all that stuff so how do<br>they keep track of it in hell news to<br>they actually find the time so ways that<br>you can actually save time is to setting<br>up a schedule so actually making a date<br>with yourself to really do it some<br>people talk about just doing it for half<br>an hour ago stockpiling content so you<br>see interesting things come through so<br>actually just keep them in a folder and<br>then you can sort of like send it<br>through you can read your posts to be<br>sent automatically then also if you have<br>a particular audience in mind that say<br>might be in the United States you can<br>actually Google what the best time is to<br>tweet or Facebook or whatever it is and<br>you can figure it a figure out like if<br>it is overseas what the best time might<br>be it's quite often when people are<br>going home they're like if they use<br>public transport they'll be on their<br>phones and doing it that way dinner time<br>is not a great great time but you can<br>research that information even you can<br>set up a Google Alert just unspecified<br>topics how many of you do have a Google<br>Alert yeah<br>so you just go on to google if you<br>google google it'll come up and it'll<br>actually if you've got a google account<br>it all sort of pop up straight away with<br>your gmail in your name but you can add<br>in different other alerts as well so<br>keywords for example and you can choose<br>to get those alerts they let you either<br>have it daily or weekly but no not<br>monthly or anything but you can get it a<br>digest form so you just get one email so<br>like once a week I'm so if anything<br>comes up about your name accompany your<br>colleagues who you work for whatever it<br>is you can actually get those alerts so<br>HootSuite is basically you can just use<br>that one platform and have all of your<br>social media accounts or most of them on<br>that one platform which is this is what<br>it looks like so it kind of is a little<br>bit crazy when you're first starting off<br>with it and my holiday project is to get<br>more to grips with HootSuite but this<br>person has that's their Facebook page<br>showing but then or account showing<br>they've also got flicker they've got<br>Google+ Twitter to wordpress blogs<br>youtube and a whole of other things as<br>well so you can post from this and you<br>can also schedule posts time them for<br>when you want them to send out so you<br>can doesn't just go to the one thing<br>rather than going on to all those<br>individual accounts so that's another<br>way of saving time so I think that<br>states what was a ten million so it's<br>not a lot that are using it but for<br>people with multiple accounts once<br>you've got to growth it can be quite<br>handy and if you're into select States<br>then they've actually have really good<br>analytics as well so you can actually<br>analyze and do spreadsheets and if<br>you're a nerd have fun like me so and<br>before we sort of go on to these and<br>sort of platforms people don't often<br>think like what is the purpose that<br>thing Oh everyone's like for me I know I<br>go onto facebook was everyone else did I<br>don't really have a purpose or a goal in<br>mind but it sort of good you know<br>because there's so many out there to<br>think about you know what is your<br>objective what is your purpose for going<br>on to these platforms and<br>no how often in reality are you going to<br>use it so considering upfront before you<br>join these things wildly and end up with<br>about 10 of these platforms that you're<br>never going to use what are you going to<br>use it for and health and in reality<br>will you use it and also you know is it<br>going to actually meet your objective so<br>talking to people finding out doing a<br>bit of research more the spectacle makes<br>you work for you and what you're trying<br>to achieve those sorts of things does<br>anyone have a media plan yep all to<br>people it's fun cool yep and also just<br>deciding also who do you want to talk to<br>you as well you know who's going to be<br>your audience that you want to reach out<br>to and that whole mixing personal and<br>professional so do you want them tangled<br>up or do you want to keep them very<br>separate ok so we've talked a bit about<br>branding personal branding and when it<br>comes to social media what we're trying<br>to do is protect our end so everything<br>that you put out there is going to be<br>seen it actually says stuff about you<br>without you knowing it's like when you<br>first go for that job interview the<br>first thing people going to see is you<br>and what you're wearing and there's a<br>saying with a bit like social media how<br>you're going to come across everything<br>you say every single photo that's going<br>to speak volumes about who you are in<br>your personal brain which is why you<br>need to be really careful about<br>protecting it and so things like you<br>know images colors and what you say you<br>know slagging off your previous employer<br>as you all know hopefully it's not a not<br>a good look and that's not going to your<br>personal brand any good especially if<br>your boss is also your friend on<br>facebook and you forgot for example<br>which has happened defriend that person<br>so yes everything you know you got to<br>think yourself as a brand like from now<br>on you are around everything say do we<br>put out on social media your CV covering<br>letter all that sort of stuff that's<br>going to speak volumes about who you are<br>as a brand because you're going to be<br>out there on public display yeah I like<br>this quote I think that sums it up<br>really well basically in terms of your<br>profiles you want to showcase your<br>talent sort of your values your<br>strengths what you're good at so all of<br>those that factors there basically make<br>up your brand your brand your personal<br>brand when it comes to work will be a<br>bit different from your personal brand<br>when it comes to free<br>and firmly but even with them you do<br>have an image that they've formed of you<br>based on some of these things and other<br>things as well so from a work point of<br>view you're actually trying to showcase<br>all of these things you can specially do<br>this on LinkedIn as well then make quite<br>easy for you to upload the CV and show<br>you off your skills and things like that<br>in terms of employers they do actually<br>scream job applicants once again steps<br>are a little bit you know but it gives<br>you a really good idea so 70 bucks per<br>send they'll go on to facebook<br>fifty-three percent Twitter forty-eight<br>percent linkedin I think that's much<br>higher now so they do check you out in<br>terms of their hiring process in which<br>phase it's after receiving an<br>application would be forty-seven percent<br>four percent right before making an<br>offer so they're kicking you out yeah so<br>I tunes are rejecting candidates eleven<br>percent post it an appropriate photos so<br>there's photos and appropriate comments<br>lovett locust lied about their<br>qualifications but the flip side is that<br>can work on your favor as well so<br>thirty-nine percent they gave a positive<br>impression of your personality and<br>organizational fetch so just briefly<br>touch the 60s so it's it's not just<br>having the profile having a static<br>profile and doing nothing about it you<br>need to join groups and engage in the<br>conversation as well I know it's that<br>time thing isn't it yep so that's why<br>the plan comes into so you need to think<br>about where your time has been keeping<br>your profile up-to-date ask and answer<br>questions be strategic about who you<br>accept onto your profiles we talked a<br>little bit about that and then posting<br>regularly for different people let all<br>mean different things like you know<br>multiple times a day once a week in<br>terms of what you post about think about<br>what you're really interested in what<br>your passions are and also which ones do<br>you have a good understanding of that<br>means that you'll be able to contribute<br>something to the discussion it doesn't<br>mean you have to be an expert but you<br>know you can contribute to the<br>discussion<br>and then think about what actually<br>excites you so you would want to post<br>about it at 2am if you happen to be<br>awake at that time and then also think<br>about how they complement your personal<br>brand so in the circles they're just<br>sort of like social media there's<br>marketing Auckland food and wine history<br>travel they all until link and overlap<br>so if you're trying to grow your<br>networks you'll try and sort of connect<br>that social media community to the<br>marketing community and combine them so<br>just a quick little thing about<br>Twitter's they're going back to those<br>circles so I've got social media their<br>marketing Auckland with Twitter they say<br>people will look at your profile and<br>maybe make up their mind about eight<br>seconds whether or not to connect with<br>you so eight seconds isn't a lot of time<br>so unlike some of the others you dont<br>have space to put in a lot of<br>information so what you put in the bio<br>is really important so that person their<br>beef heart has got marketing PR social<br>media consultant adjunct professor<br>history addict ever Drita art culture<br>buff fan of beer cowgirl boots and<br>brilliance so you get a really good<br>snapshot in a very short space of time<br>of what the cheese about then the other<br>one we were trying to figure this one<br>out when we're doing hmmm pet members of<br>Alyssa Faraday were a couple of dogs<br>nothing out new friends dogs cats humans<br>we love everyone and want to play<br>frisbee ya ass we didn't get it either<br>like what yeah so you get a request to<br>connect with that person to let so your<br>bio for Twitter needs to be really<br>really really clear so Twitter is useful<br>for connecting a lot of people say it's<br>useful for the meeting with thought<br>leaders whatever that means its interest<br>it's actually really helpful for getting<br>information so I've got a friend who's a<br>writer so she just posted something and<br>Twitter she basically asked if anyone<br>knew about what happens when someone<br>yeah absolutely and then I think it was<br>a senior trauma surgeon from one of the<br>top American you know hospitals actually<br>almost instantly responded and said yes<br>I can answer that question and then they<br>went offline and had a chat but before<br>she actually sort of she did actually<br>check her out to make sure that she was<br>who she said she wasn't she found a<br>photo and everything else but you can<br>just send a random question on Twitter<br>and you'd be amazed who actually will<br>give the answer so it's great source of<br>information yes so the truck has<br>hashtags so that you're narrowing that<br>down pinterest and instagram next a lot<br>of common ones that we think of when it<br>comes to our career but if you think<br>about once again going back and think<br>about your goal think about who your<br>target audiences if it's american woman<br>for example pinterest if it's apparently<br>English men do you think about your<br>users and think about where they are if<br>your users with sort of you know teens<br>you'd be on snapchat so you do need to<br>think about where the people you want to<br>connect with our Google+ predominantly<br>men so it's things like that so think<br>about the users think about their age<br>groups as well and then in terms of what<br>to post you know these photos so events<br>so we could have taken a photo of this<br>stick it on Instagram office space even<br>quotes of people who inspire you lead<br>reading list of books so there are<br>things that you can actually do on these<br>as well that will help your career it'll<br>help your personal brand okay<br>so what you can do with Facebook is oh<br>by the way if you don't know if you want<br>to see what the public see if you go<br>onto your profile and where it says view<br>activity log and you've got the three<br>dots if you click on that and then do<br>view as you'll actually see what the<br>public see but if you want them to you<br>can actually fill out the about me page<br>so you could fill out the week and<br>education if you wanted for example so<br>you can use it to give them an<br>indication of you sort of person you are<br>from a career perspective places you've<br>lived fairly relationships you might<br>want to skip that one details about you<br>so you can fill out that section and<br>then it can be public so you get a<br>choice of whether it's visible to the<br>public friends or only me I don't know<br>why you do that but the other<br>alternative is to forget about all of<br>that and have a public page so a fan<br>page so the difference is if it's your<br>sort of its friends that's your pro<br>private profile but if you're liking a<br>page it's a public page it's a fan page<br>so on the left-hand comic and column of<br>your your profile there's actually a<br>section and caps that saves pages and<br>under that it says create a page you've<br>got like pages created create a page if<br>you click on create a page it'll bring<br>you to a page that looks a lot like that<br>with local business artists band or<br>public figure you could actually say<br>like be a business person a blogger and<br>author or she if there's a great big<br>long list so you could have your own fan<br>page and then you could put whatever you<br>like on them linkedin this is obvious<br>staff so professional photos<br>recommendations but I find a lot of<br>people skip that's that step and terms<br>are getting recommendations from<br>colleagues and employers connecting with<br>a few people with a large linkedin<br>network means you actually have an<br>access to a really big network because<br>you have access to their connections so<br>that's been strategic<br>joining several groups and your career<br>field as well contribute to discussions<br>yep because I'm when you're contributing<br>because people often say to us you know<br>how can I stand out in LinkedIn and one<br>way to do those actually contribute to<br>those group postings so join a group but<br>make sure that you are active and<br>actually comment on things and if you<br>find an interesting article then post it<br>you know it can be just putting the<br>Lincoln and set up I just found an<br>interesting article about careers in our<br>case that's always a good thing to keep<br>active and just post things that's how<br>people can stand apart from this joining<br>everything you could also have your own<br>website so on the website you can have<br>everything connecting to the website you<br>can have a copy of your CV you can have<br>examples of your work so that's really<br>powerful as well so just general<br>principles google alerts so that you can<br>track and see what people are doing<br>that's what it looks like when you<br>actually set up the alert you can write<br>in the Bardia what you want to create<br>the alert about it automatically came up<br>with my name think about the fact that<br>what your post actually leaves the<br>permanent record so think about you know<br>sort of in 20 years time you know your<br>family might see what you part so yes<br>you need to know who owns your social<br>media I wanted to emphasize that and you<br>can link it so business cards for<br>example you can link everything to each<br>other and that's the end of the<br>presentation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
