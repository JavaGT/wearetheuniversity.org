us<br>politics evidently and still has many<br>contacts in the thick of DC so she will<br>be helping me ask the questions today<br>and also I just like her to outline the<br>situation the big picture stuff just to<br>get the ball rolling thanks Ali so a big<br>picture what we're headed to is we were<br>down to really four major candidates to<br>on the Republican side two on the<br>Democratic side on the Republican side<br>we have Donald Trump and we have Center<br>to Ted Cruz from Texas on the Democratic<br>side former Secretary of State Hillary<br>Clinton and Bernie Sanders senator<br>Sanders from Vermont and the were headed<br>into the conventions that will happen in<br>July and as a expat living in New<br>Zealand this is a primary we were<br>talking before we started about whether<br>globally the primaries have been<br>followed as closely as they have this<br>time internationally and I have to say<br>this is the first time I've been<br>installed in the street at the primary<br>level by taxi drivers but if I'm at the<br>grocery store and the predominant<br>question is how has trauma gotten this<br>far everybody wants to know that so it's<br>it's it's a particular mood in the<br>States Washington Post in her article<br>about how Trump got to be so popular and<br>they came down to four reasons and first<br>is he keeps it simple it's not always<br>right but his statements are simple he's<br>tapping into some concerns about<br>immigrants that people have and third he<br>is anti-establishment and I would say<br>that's a theme that I've seen throughout<br>because I've never really considered<br>senator Sanders as a stalwart of the<br>Democratic Party as well so there's<br>there's that issue and the fourth one is<br>he's saying things that people have been<br>afraid to say but I've been thinking all<br>along so Dan it would be helpful if you<br>agree with my big picture outline and<br>what you think is going on at this time<br>no I agree entirely even I think that<br>virtually every presidential candidate<br>runs as auntie establishment in as an<br>outsider anti-washington is<br>better a better description but I think<br>in this case he has been able to benefit<br>from strategies that usually discount a<br>candidate early on and that I think owes<br>a lot to his populism he is using what<br>is we sometimes called demagoguery of<br>building up emotions over issues that<br>usually return people off and I think it<br>is a reflection on the age a reflection<br>on the time oh he is somebody who can<br>claim directly that we're giving jobs<br>away to China and then when he's<br>confronted by David Letterman with one<br>of his own products that is made in<br>china say all not a problem this is just<br>something that I do and not suffer the<br>consequences now I think that is a<br>reflection on selective viewing and I<br>think when people begin to view<br>selectively as they are they are<br>essentially victims they feel themselves<br>to be victimized and this is an age in<br>which many people are victimized there<br>is a best-selling New York Times book<br>from the early part of this century<br>called what's the matter with kansas and<br>it is an exploration of lies so many<br>humble people are voting against their<br>own immediate interests in places like<br>Kansas it began looking at Obamacare and<br>which Obama likes that title so I'll use<br>it of they were outraged they went to<br>these town hall meetings of President<br>Obama held over his health care outrage<br>that he would disrupt their sacred<br>relationship with their doctor<br>knowing somewhere in the back of their<br>minds that they didn't have the money<br>for a doctor but had somehow been<br>influenced to the point where they<br>thought their rights were being taken<br>away from them and I think that that is<br>a reflection on the age and Donald Trump<br>is definitely a symbol of how people are<br>feeling and the more you know it is<br>you're saying that he's attacked and the<br>morn he's attack for some people the<br>more that's evidence that he's an<br>anti-establishment and and it increases<br>his credentials instead of decreases<br>Prudential there's that and there's also<br>the little bit of something else which I<br>think we have to remember is goes back<br>to the founding of the United States one<br>of the plans for the Constitution was<br>proposed by Alexander Hamilton and that<br>was an American monarchy it was to<br>create a strong powerful but almost<br>monarchical president and in a sense<br>Trump because of his success is aspired<br>to I can't think of a better word but<br>people both admire him and ignore the<br>fact that he got there on the backs of<br>thousands of people to his bankruptcy so<br>he hasn't got he said he's got no<br>political experience he says it can't be<br>the greatest jobs president but you know<br>where's the evidence how's he going to<br>battle it out what is he would be<br>exactly is an element of desperation in<br>these voters I mean it's something like<br>this for all unite us in of them say the<br>angry of the establishment the federal<br>government before you've seen them<br>people are going to try and see they<br>feel betrayed by the Republican Party<br>you know who else are they gonna vote<br>another vanilla moderate candidate you<br>there Cruz but Trump has managed through<br>his persona megalomania to offer them<br>and even further outside of the box keep<br>in mind that Cruz is the only senator<br>who has the full backing of the Tea<br>Party faction now this is an interesting<br>we're shooting co-opted done well keep<br>in mind though this is an interesting<br>situation for the Republican Party<br>because something like eighteen percent<br>of the american population associates<br>himself with the Republican themselves<br>with the Republican Party but over fifty<br>percent associated themselves with the<br>Tea Party faction so the Republican<br>Party is not very positive and I don't<br>know that I would call senator Cruz the<br>did you see moderate you know he's not<br>even vaguely then he's not a step which<br>Republicans have rejected all of them<br>are yes and then all two opportunities<br>of an together from Canada it hits to<br>one of the other things that I think<br>that we should mention today is about an<br>Indian and I were talking about this<br>beforehand is about what an odd system<br>the US has and so I think people in<br>those states are you worried about<br>primary caucuses super-delegates not<br>super delegates bounded delegates you<br>know it's it's a lengthy process and<br>there's different rules for every state<br>and if you're in and it's left some<br>voters feeling disenfranchised and even<br>you know probably feeding into the Trump<br>phenomenon because they feel like their<br>vote doesn't count that it's a rigged<br>system and keep in mind that the<br>Republican National Convention if there<br>is not a clear and that is very clear<br>front runner at the conversed vote could<br>go into hundreds of votes because<br>delegates are only pledged for that<br>first vote and then training begins<br>offers for you yes sir sorry I out<br>Commendatore Eastern from Paul here he<br>says what can we New Zealanders do<br>online or otherwise to best help the<br>anti-trafficking you can through paypal<br>do something do you like Bernie Sanders<br>of other candidates well not a very good<br>time no but you can have a free news<br>American citizen give them money that<br>they can give it<br>nangi truck canada is it through paypal<br>i understand and talking about sandesh I<br>kids we have to give the Democrats sort<br>of a look in here and lender i guess if<br>we look to you now we've got Hillary<br>Clinton and Bernie Sanders do you think<br>the states are ready for a woman<br>president oh well well if I just go back<br>to trump and then maybe take him out of<br>the way for a moment um it's<br>particularly interesting at the moment<br>when we do have Trump and he's getting<br>this summer's the anti-establishment<br>followers and he's appealing to some<br>other things that you reminded us about<br>and the start either about those people<br>who have fears about their kind of<br>national security fears about their<br>livelihoods and so on so you really pays<br>and plays into that but it also plays<br>into not just you know racism or class<br>issues but he definitely plays into<br>sexism and homophobia so we know we know<br>that he's been saying some appalling<br>things about women he's frequently cited<br>as being abusive to women journalists<br>even if he likes them Robbins answering<br>their question he'll say you are<br>beautiful so he diminishes their<br>authority by calling them until they<br>totally being by saying this is what I<br>think about you just threw appearance so<br>Trump is the misogynist that the great<br>misogynist here and then allows other<br>folk to also to be misogynist as well<br>and then you get this kind of following<br>where they live their prejudice come to<br>the fore and that's a difficult<br>situation to be in full Hillary Clinton<br>well yes or no it can be to her<br>advantage but with Bernie Sanders and<br>Hillary Clinton we've got a really<br>interesting part of your like going on<br>there around gender as well because<br>Bernie can be very vivacious outspoken<br>really um it has rallies you see of this<br>you know going like this and threaten<br>the table and calling everyone you know<br>to to get behind them but<br>when Hillary Clinton is outspoken and<br>starting to raise her voice she gets a<br>lot of negative attention by the media<br>and by others saying she's shouting<br>she's too shrill so to her her Authority<br>is diminish by the very voice that she<br>uses whereas the mayoral candidates can<br>be very very varied and their responses<br>to till they kept to the to the voters<br>to the audiences so we have a really<br>interesting ways there so you know<br>Clinton if she is to be the first female<br>prime president in the US is she able to<br>be really transformative and who<br>campaign while Bernie Sanders come he's<br>undermining that with his own<br>personality so she really doesn't have<br>that kind of transformative following it<br>but you know if she still got trauma to<br>run against if he gets through then that<br>could work in a favor because we know<br>that Trumper's not just upsetting woman<br>in general but upsetting Republican<br>Republican woman and so I was heartened<br>by that about that that seemed to be<br>when he finally started to lose traction<br>is that that was the line it was the<br>loan with women and i think that<br>republican women came out and vocalizing<br>that this is not a right where this<br>youth you've crossed a line and his<br>support started to diminish you know for<br>the first time and then i'll see so he<br>had his wife come out to speak on his<br>behalf it I don't know that that was so<br>successful but catch them take my wife's<br>better than yesterday I really don't<br>think we've seen the Republican<br>candidate for president yeah so is it I<br>just think it might be somebody like<br>Polaroid who a goat a bleep tire here on<br>the boat and the primary elections<br>though that be opposed with them they've<br>done that many times in the past and now<br>in the media echo chamber there today I<br>could to see this being and we're able<br>to achieve a problem the problem with<br>Cruz and Trump who are the best winners<br>of votes is that neither of them are<br>acceptable to the Republican Party and<br>Kasich is a minor figure as far as votes<br>so far and ryan is speaker the house of<br>representatives and has like Napoleon<br>refused to crown a couple of times<br>before we accepted it but for me<br>although Bernie Sanders has received a<br>lot of small donations and it's great<br>that you decide so many well big money<br>is going to Hillary Clinton's from Saudi<br>an autumn net that's one of the Facebook<br>questions that i want to ask so from<br>michael says that that senator senator<br>Sanders has broken records and small<br>donations and and that his question is<br>it possible that this could be a new<br>standard expectation for future<br>candidates is this a sign that big money<br>is going to go out of campaigns well<br>actually the thing about campaign<br>donations the small donations can be<br>used to support directly support Bernie<br>Sanders campaign but because of the<br>nuances of funding elections packs as<br>you are very familiar for the political<br>action committees allow unlimited<br>donations by single contributors to try<br>to defeat particular candidates this is<br>a loophole in the laws the Koch brothers<br>speckled chaos eh who are ultra<br>conservative but who support same-sex<br>marriage and a lot of other progressive<br>causes have shifted their funding this<br>year to Hillary Clinton usually they<br>support ultra right-wing causes they're<br>against anything that looks like<br>response to climate change but they work<br>very closely with Obama for some reason<br>they've now shifted their funding to<br>Hillary Clinton their ability to defeat<br>a candidate is far far greater than<br>Bernie Sanders level 15 dollar donations<br>and I would like to thank these good<br>small<br>donations will somehow change the face<br>of urs electricals but this is going to<br>be another three or four billion dollar<br>election and it's the big money that's<br>going to make a difference you can you<br>get more money coming in from rich<br>communities because of this urgency of<br>small donations so Reuben I so Linda's<br>talked about the impact on women I'm<br>kind of curious about your view on the<br>international implications of this<br>election when what are you seen as the<br>implications of how it's developed so<br>far well we go the frontrunner Donald<br>Trump or really a large chunk of the<br>Republican policy establishment I've<br>already come out and repudiated them<br>they're already saying any discussions<br>with officials overseas that American<br>credibility and predictability is<br>already in question and that's really<br>undermining Americans and Trust the fact<br>that he's gotten where he's gotten if<br>you look at it if you stare back with<br>what Trump says clearest articulation<br>you have is its recent interviews the<br>new york times a week or so ago in which<br>he couldn't blow by logos food from<br>hearts the world he calls an American<br>first right so it's not isolationist in<br>an every single case East Asia the<br>Middle East NATO alliance keeping Japan<br>and South Korea secure and so on<br>everything comes down to what does<br>America get out of it if there's a trio<br>of Japan Japan should have to pay a bit<br>more for that trip it's like a<br>protection racket right the mark user<br>comes into town towards the business and<br>the deariens is give me more give me<br>money and I'll pratik you are the free<br>trade agreements he says he doesn't<br>reject free trade that he talks up via<br>trade basically renegotiating those<br>bitter terms for America it's also just<br>even listening to I can state it a lot<br>of Americans with your debt and say well<br>what's wrongs rolled up sounds good<br>tonight what happens there don't we Amir<br>no we won our president to put American<br>interest first well you can think about<br>like a CEO and near his arm you know<br>that they all the stocks understand the<br>shareholders and he's one of these for<br>them so I can completely see their point<br>of view point of view I guess though we<br>have this idea in the world now a<br>rules-based system of some form of<br>equality trade agreements that you<br>should benefit us and you somewhat<br>equally but it sounds to me he wants it<br>to be nothing more than and you can<br>understand that thank you just if we get<br>a bit more parochial eric says he's<br>relatively new to New Zealand how<br>important these allegiance to museum and<br>and what are the implications facility<br>leave for New Zealand of Trump does<br>happen I mean great my name is two<br>things he give everything is about<br>giving more for America and Trump's view<br>so it could very well be like a mirror<br>to New Zealand you come you kind of<br>we've got a bit of defect or line to the<br>Americans among we don't have a security<br>treat that says they guarantee our<br>security something goes wrong but it's<br>kind of implicit under the surface we do<br>have a tree it's a major non-nato<br>military alliance 1998 but it's not a<br>gleek discreet read on the order of<br>nature but i'd like to mention print i'm<br>pretty much saying to new zealand look<br>we're going to renegotiate the TPP you<br>live me you're going to suck it up and<br>it's going to allow this access for you<br>into the entire country maybe we'll<br>press in from New Zealand who knows you<br>put up your defense budget seen more<br>troops overseas to fight and our<br>dimensions review I like it a largest<br>army deployment at the moment is already<br>in Iraq we talk about these days but<br>that's that's we are last for a military<br>deployment is oh he might just say okay<br>well we want more of those you want you<br>to be the pen Spanish to be bigger we're<br>going to renegotiate the TVP you can't<br>do anything about it so I think I think<br>we may end up paying if he actually take<br>him at his word we will might end up<br>doing more for the Americans in terms of<br>what suits their strategic interests and<br>of course we say indirectly that suits<br>us because it wonders for my security<br>umbrella just agree with you a little<br>bit I think it will be similar to george<br>w bush we don't know what this person is<br>going to do because he's<br>I don't want to say a but he has<br>no credibility will depend on who he<br>appoints end of it he is right to be<br>captured yeah whoever ends up being<br>appointed will capture that part of<br>Trump and it's a sport lad he ceded to<br>the New York Times key part of his<br>foreign policies unpredictability he<br>doesn't want other countries to know<br>what he's going to do before he doesn't<br>so former Secretary of State probably<br>well-traveled inability energy yes we<br>have to look to a key article in<br>Atlantic in February called the Obama<br>doc and after a careful analysis of<br>Obama's realist foreign policy which is<br>really enlightening I think New Zealand<br>got the very best deal we could have<br>possibly got from Obama yet I don't like<br>we're going to find a better president<br>on the horizon for New Zealand's foreign<br>policy we had a rapprochement<br>unprecedented value we almost have<br>resurrected ANZUS we've got sympathies<br>that I never expected to see within a<br>two-year period part of that is that is<br>the relationship that's been built I<br>mean that's right the Wellington<br>declaration but a lot of it had to do<br>with Obama because of his pivot to Asia<br>and because of the value that he gave to<br>New Zealand first we don't know why but<br>exactly but we have some indication if a<br>night eh yes I was going to say well I<br>don't think it can be maintained with<br>any of the candidates that we see right<br>now on the horizon we need another<br>realest realest I would be pretty much<br>basically agree with that and then Obama<br>doctrine article does outline is won't<br>very well and it does suit newzealand<br>well it's rude on ideological not<br>picking fights over differences right<br>there and there's your daddy nuclear<br>policy for example was not<br>Madonna any significant form please<br>willing to forego the problems that led<br>to the USS Buchanans rejection so this<br>is in the atlantic monthly or the<br>atlantic magazine and februari and it is<br>a must read article to understand<br>exactly that question but i think that<br>again we haven't seen an emerging<br>candidate yet and when we look at in<br>that article Hillary's Hillary Clinton's<br>proposed foreign policy and the way in<br>which Obama motivated her foreign policy<br>time and time again I think that Hillary<br>Clinton would have been much harder on<br>New Zealand and much harder on a lot of<br>other countries as well would have<br>probably bombed at Damascus and she's<br>boy simple I'm old binds to the Syrian<br>rebels to you know even a 2008 good<br>Green Revolution uprising against the<br>Iranian mullahs he said she said she was<br>American turning before Leah um yeah<br>across the board many issues in the<br>least she seized America would into the<br>world provide more so when I think about<br>women making a difference in u.s.<br>politics I think of the first woman<br>elected to Congress from my state of<br>Montana jeannette rankin she was first<br>elected in 1916 and she was one of a<br>very few women to vote against entry to<br>world war one she was immediately<br>defeated / Connors after that and then<br>she didn't get back into the house of<br>representatives until just before World<br>War two and she was the only member of<br>Congress to vote against US entry into<br>World War two so obvious issue and she<br>was defeated right after that they are<br>you know if you're doing you down if<br>you're done so if you come out fighting<br>as a woman kissed it and say I'm<br>fighting and say so we will increase us<br>expenditure we will do this we will<br>wander this because and so on then you<br>get usually a bone well well maybe not<br>as a woman but you what is the man<br>perhaps but as a woman if you say no I'm<br>not going to do that that's at what<br>she's too weak tomato jeannette rankin<br>was a very courageous woman the first<br>woman elected to the US Congress but she<br>was only in for two two-year terms<br>because she took a courageous stand<br>against war is there a risk component<br>compensation to make up for this you<br>know do the woman assort week Clinton<br>could espouse a more muscular foreign<br>policy even take steps that maybe<br>someone else wouldn't cause she's<br>worried about it even though I don't owe<br>you it's a fine balance to play and<br>she'd for the most part in who run-up to<br>the election that has not been talking<br>about herself as a woman she's trying to<br>avoid that as if she could be<br>gender-neutral almost but sometimes<br>she's used it to call for some support<br>when Bernie Sanders has been saying you<br>know you're too shrill you you shouting<br>too much about arms and so forth so you<br>know we look at all the other woman<br>leaders that we've had in the world and<br>we can think of people like The Iron<br>Lady Margaret Thatcher Golda Meir yes<br>yes went and we we know that kind of<br>reception that our own Prime Minister<br>helen clark air to that and you take a<br>hard line or you don't you get get told<br>that you're too weak for the position<br>you get rolled in that respect so it's<br>always a juggling act for these women<br>leaders about how to then make their<br>foreign policy and innovative she is<br>clearly getting women's votes though in<br>the US certain and she will probably<br>overcome a lot of the negative vote with<br>her natural advantage there so but I<br>fear that her patterns of her<br>belligerent patterns will continue as<br>president<br>so the next big primary is Tuesday New<br>York lot at stake the senator Sanders<br>and Hillary Clinton go on going<br>head-to-head and Donald Trump and<br>senator Cruz as well and so any thoughts<br>about how it's going to play out and I<br>don't want you to look in your crystal<br>ball or anything just the the aspects of<br>New York that's been different from the<br>rest of the primaries going forward but<br>we have a mayor of New York come out and<br>support of Trump recently it's me the<br>governor Oh Eddie chris Christie<br>specificity ya know Chris precision<br>Jersey these Christie Christie is deeply<br>embroiled still in scandal because it is<br>his officials diversion of traffic<br>across a bridge yes apparently Trump in<br>Clinton or a heat by double-digits truck<br>like duty through proceed to the moment<br>ago but of course it's it's potentially<br>on their reality I some towers so he<br>must have some home base these created<br>jobs there so on and so forth so I think<br>next of Lucky except the polls had been<br>wrong a few times during this moment<br>that's another interesting feature of<br>this is that it's how wrong the polls<br>have been it and so there's a degree of<br>skepticism when you say that you even<br>added that caveat is is an indication of<br>how the polls have not quite indicated<br>and I wonder what I that it i'm not sure<br>whether Trump looks to be behind in<br>Pennsylvania though which is if anything<br>more important for him when New York he<br>has been counting on New York so why do<br>you say Pennsylvania is more important<br>than me more well because he had New<br>York in bed but Pennsylvania is one of<br>those states that he has an exaggerated<br>for him and becomes a strange state in<br>the primaries because he has to capture<br>forty percent or more according to<br>silver<br>in order to maintain his track to<br>getting the head requisite number and<br>Trump head was constant in the bag until<br>about two weeks beforehand he's his and<br>you important comments I think can't<br>continue to say just the ledger and<br>comment after comment and come and get<br>away with this yeah and I think there<br>may have been a slight turning point a<br>couple weeks and he made those abortion<br>comedies that are outside the mainstream<br>on both the Democratic end actually most<br>of the Republican side and Wisconsin man<br>i can't said it was cause so do you get<br>that collateral damage will follow him<br>to Pennsylvania or is he going to so<br>some people have said that in business<br>he's been very good at exploiting the<br>rules this goes back to the process<br>again yeah and that he has not quite<br>gotten the primary process and he hasn't<br>it has big a short-term decision-making<br>live so yummy m's a long-term strategic<br>for sending back yeah even if they keep<br>coming up this comment to me why doesn't<br>he just put it to the center i'ma born<br>early on my new man and a dream can just<br>wipe out more give her the charm<br>offensive oh you're on but he's not<br>doing it and so you just wonder what<br>horribly won't take place and there's<br>the worry of people to be President that<br>you wouldn't take a bus because I'm not<br>sure he will don't have kids present he<br>gets it he doesn't have time I I don't<br>know what whatever New York but I was<br>just in San Francisco I capital weeks<br>ago and getting the feel through the<br>media or the and talking to talk about<br>what they thought about this and I<br>picked up a magazine People magazine<br>popular magazine which starts on the<br>title page who is the real Donald Trump<br>as if there was something behind and it<br>says he's bought whole savvy and some<br>say scary people talks to friends and<br>foes about club Plus how he really feels<br>about women so there's still this brand<br>that's going on that he's you know he's<br>willing to look at him let's see if he<br>is a new man or not but according to<br>this article which also has somewhat<br>interesting photos of the man himself<br>Christopher yeah it's wonderful<br>comb-over that it straight here it it<br>does show that that the level of support<br>is high for someone who wants to be<br>there outsider you know who can make a<br>lot of money and it's where a lot of the<br>votes are coming from what about issues<br>of race as Michaels come over the<br>question no sorry Scott and ham why does<br>Clinton have the african-american vote<br>when Sanders policies are likely to help<br>them more and well and end with head of<br>course that's not actually true the<br>african-american vote is hiving off to<br>some extent to Sanders right now it's<br>not clearly to Clinton but Clinton as<br>the first lady of Arkansas was schooled<br>and a lot of very important policies<br>that had to do with african-americans<br>well I think that she growing up in<br>Chicago as a Republican she was very<br>aware of the policies that protect<br>african-americans and she has been<br>involved in that but at the same time I<br>think she's very vulnerable to a switch<br>by the final election because Bernie<br>Sanders is um misma sorry switch onto it<br>from hood hood divini to burn him yeah<br>oh and depending on who the Republicans<br>come up with in the general election she<br>could be vulnerable there a piston well<br>although I can't imagine a Republican<br>candidate who would out polar that<br>african-americans everyone can so one<br>thing I've noticed just as a difference<br>from the American psyche in the New<br>Zealand psyche is that and this came up<br>with the Google Hangouts when the<br>students were asked who they would<br>support everybody loves Bernie you know<br>it's<br>is all around make sense and I think<br>because the the social welfare system in<br>this country is so more closely aligned<br>to what he's advocating and it's<br>considered to be a little bit more<br>radical in India was not one policy it<br>is right states rights for guns he is a<br>strong supporter of states rights for<br>gun legislation and that is just beyond<br>the pale so I think it was two days ago<br>that the carry law went into effect in<br>Texas 50 years after the first big<br>campus shooting and the University of<br>Texas is now advising its lecturers not<br>to avoid controversial subjects because<br>their students are allowed to carry<br>concealed handguns in their backpacks Oh<br>some of the state's my state of Montana<br>have the most incredible gun legislation<br>Montana has a castle law that allows you<br>to kill somebody you record a lot of<br>that has not been the focus of this to<br>being so here has a it really I be so<br>I'm not discounting I'm just saying that<br>it doesn't seem like it's done it hasn't<br>come through I mean I don't know because<br>the NRA is so powerful and has so much<br>legislation going in various forms that<br>it's almost death for anybody to talk<br>about to this you could leave on dump<br>you for nudity it's the same of Obama<br>though wasn't it yes young people them<br>over all coalesce around siding in a<br>different energetic end your little one<br>in the Democratic Party you have a big<br>cement of liberals you know how to your<br>mobile people the selection of last<br>calling themselves very liberal so even<br>within the Republican establishment and<br>a democratic establishment you're<br>getting greater logical portions of each<br>fruit and these are the viewpoint<br>because there is yes on the fringes but<br>but and this is what the primary style<br>capture there's also that growing<br>segment of America<br>consider themselves independents and<br>independence aren't oh it depends on the<br>state by state system are always allowed<br>to vote in the primaries and so we're<br>not really getting that sense of where<br>the independents are whoever can go in<br>the products because there are welcome<br>primaries it depends on state well there<br>are very few closed primaries almost<br>every primary you just walk into the<br>polling place and ask for a democratic<br>or Republican ballot Paul seems<br>everybody there that is the long primary<br>electoral process and strange party<br>delegates system based system part of<br>the problem here the problem is is how<br>it will be fixed is I whoever wins and<br>it's really not enough that whoever wins<br>is probably doesn't have the vested<br>interest to fix it and so but that's how<br>it keeps going on and on and I just<br>don't know that that's gonna even though<br>people have looked at it and said in<br>more detail I think than ever before and<br>said what an odd system that we have but<br>it's who's going to change it how would<br>that actually be changed hmm you haven't<br>crossed positive consensus to do it as<br>we know the moment Americans incredibly<br>polarized I kind of girl most basic<br>things because he's scared that they do<br>so the other side will get some<br>political benefit and they want and<br>that's indicated by the candidate that<br>we have right now so you know as we said<br>clearly an anti-establishment but<br>senator Cruz also is not embraced by the<br>Republican Party in any sense of the<br>word he's not a mainstream candidate<br>senator Sanders who didn't even call<br>himself a Democrat in 2012 pressure and<br>and then leaves on a socialist probably<br>Hillary Clinton is the the closest to<br>someone who and I'm not advocating for<br>one wit but is probably the one who is<br>the most establishment kind of candidate<br>or so you see you right down the middle<br>yeah the but now I were started building<br>about building because you didn't ask a<br>prospective to get things done you need<br>to build coalition he's just one more or<br>the other he has to be a coalition<br>coalition is the is the key to a<br>democratic society because people don't<br>think the same and that's why I think<br>somebody like Paul Ryan who is very<br>conservative but who has nonetheless<br>played the route play by the rules and<br>the House of Representatives is a more<br>likely candidate than anybody else I<br>said yeah well Kasich is kind of not<br>really charismatic or well known Paul<br>Ryan maybe we should make sure that we<br>cover he what do people think is gonna I<br>don't want to live without that many<br>argue that Hillary Clinton leads the<br>Democratic primaries over Bernie Sanders<br>because the mainstream media have helped<br>her get there this is Kristen concern<br>why is it then a candidate like Donald<br>Trump who is clearly enticed an<br>anti-establishment candidate thrives and<br>Republican primaries so he's saying that<br>CNN had pushed the establishment agenda<br>do you think that's right Ultron's great<br>onto your busines cuz these disturbances<br>mouth and something comes out and people<br>are react so you get a lot of audience<br>when you put Donald Trump in front of<br>the camera and he loves that he loves to<br>grand stand in their way make outrageous<br>from us so you know the media does<br>follow that and he has been in the long<br>life because of it in clinton in content<br>yeah well has she been supported by<br>major media institutions for probably<br>look she comes from the Clinton family<br>and she comes from that background of<br>knowing how to work with that media to<br>be in the to be in the spotlight and<br>she's a partner on impeached prospects<br>resonate a stronger<br>but you know whatever forget it because<br>that she always is to carry their litter<br>um I was in the u.s. a few weeks ago so<br>Sarah dodo but I found that the media<br>overall was quite good at being giving a<br>balance both pro and negative view of<br>the candidates you just sit there<br>understanding my hotel room and jump<br>clean Fox News CNN MSNBC if i watch any<br>single one of them I would have no real<br>deal what about your location okay and<br>what was kind of the mood in Atlanta<br>everyone was in denial about Trump your<br>own city currently there's no way yes I<br>see what are we saying this six months<br>ago is now well I when I was in the San<br>Francisco couple weeks ago I went to a<br>basketball game and there was t-shirts<br>so currently president and San Francisco<br>in VA so there would be it's the first<br>thing the first day of classes my<br>students were whispering in that if i'll<br>i said you know what's going on we want<br>to ask you how did don't Donald Trump<br>get here you know it's just really it's<br>it is it's all hustle one convoy not<br>many on the media helping or hindering<br>candidates it's 40 scene of Americans in<br>a poll last year see they no longer<br>trust and mainstream media sixty percent<br>of republicans don't trust the<br>mainstream media 30 was seen of<br>democrats don't trust makes you being so<br>even a lot of the stuff around<br>mainstream media almost half of<br>americans now they either just ignore it<br>or they don't believe it and to give me<br>a why it is social media a factor in<br>this election yes you know has it been<br>part we're doing a google anything else<br>is a good good question has social media<br>is that where people are getting their<br>their media i think the people that are<br>supporting Trump probably would be no<br>social media if it looks behind really<br>but I think what I've seen these are<br>disadvantaged mostly white other fold as<br>well it missing out there is this a<br>normal I know so what does that look<br>does that mean when you say that that<br>means if you tell someone that a pro<br>trump supporter that the leader of the<br>Ku Klux Klan what supports them or<br>something like that they'll say I don't<br>need I don't believe that or I'd be to<br>find on Google KKK and Clinton a picture<br>will come up showing some kk to the<br>supporter as well it's kind of a reading<br>around reality raise an interesting<br>point because in the 1990s David Duke a<br>Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and a<br>member the one of the American Nazi<br>party's got the nomination for governor<br>of Louisiana there the there's no party<br>discipline in the United States so the<br>Republicans were saying well he's not<br>one of us but he was on the ballot as<br>the Republican nominee for governor<br>Edwin Edwards who was the Democrat was<br>under indictment for corruption and<br>later went to federal prison but they<br>had to have an election with a Ku Klux<br>Klan leader who incidentally supports<br>Donald Trump right now he was endorse<br>Donald Trump and the bumper stickers all<br>said vote for the crook it's important<br>because they didn't have a choice a<br>devoted for the Crocker they voted for a<br>white supremacist to Professor Zerkers<br>point on coalition's this is from Angus<br>has the primary highlighted the weakness<br>of the Republican coalition can social<br>conservatives small business owners and<br>big businesses coexist within the same<br>party or do we ideally need to see the<br>formation of new more a party well new<br>smaller parties do emerge in United<br>States from time to time the last time<br>that a smaller party became a bigger<br>party was in 1858 so it does i know it<br>doesn't happen very often that's when<br>the Whigs became the modern republican<br>party typically these smaller third<br>parties last for one or maybe two<br>elections the the Progressive Party in<br>1924 of<br>but it's very very difficult because in<br>a first-past-the-post system two parties<br>typically remain the way they are but<br>you're absolutely right coalition's are<br>very difficult when you have a great big<br>financial interests and small interests<br>and then you have what are called<br>horizontal coalition's and you know they<br>just don't work very well you have<br>bullying you have big big capital and<br>small people and it's just not a very<br>democratic system but keep in mind one<br>of the big fears of the founders of the<br>United States as encapsulated in<br>Madison's federalist paper number 10 was<br>the fear of democracy so that's why the<br>democracy too much democracy so the well<br>democracy in general I mean Madison was<br>very clear democracy was a danger the<br>Republic was threatened by democracy so<br>that's why the American people do not<br>vote directly for the President of the<br>United States they vote for 538 electors<br>and it's possible that thirty-seven<br>percent of the american people can elect<br>a president the united states and that<br>the 60-some percent can vote for a loser<br>that's what scott says here how<br>inclusive to all voters is the American<br>election system at the population only<br>chooses one of four possible demographic<br>choices and winner-takes-all though<br>clear yeah that's right it's winner take<br>all in all but two states and though<br>post our winner-take-all in districts<br>Maine and Nebraska and if I if somebody<br>takes just a bare majority in the<br>general election of the popular vote in<br>California New York Florida Ohio Texas<br>and loses by landslides in the rest of<br>the country they win the election and so<br>even when Americans pull that they are<br>willing to vote for a third party that<br>their interests about for third party<br>they go into the ballot booth and they<br>don't vote for a third party<br>so then you'll be throwing away their<br>woke basically bigger on things that<br>have cooled out throwing away so we have<br>to get away from that minds yeah the<br>other thing you have to keep in mind and<br>this happens in New Zealand that happens<br>in a lot of places many people vote<br>against ya go to vote against Christian<br>so you don't see very many creative<br>votes so well it just as a final exit<br>I'd like to know why you think it's<br>gonna get it must I be here either<br>mm-hmm I said Hillary you to be Hillary<br>that's my I'm on the record it's gonna<br>be I think that that she knows the<br>system the best I think that she's seen<br>as the more moderate candidate I think<br>what it goes across the country that<br>she'll she'll be well supported so I<br>vote I suspect that it's going to be the<br>Clinton that's my prediction I suspect a<br>little as well as the Republicans goers<br>crumbed it will I'm I feel it will be<br>about Clinton to take the to be the<br>first woman president the many ways to<br>have a tough job do you have a tough job<br>yeah she will but I think it'll be here<br>then um I think Clinton too I think<br>she's a wiki candidate but i think the<br>all week candidates in the selection i<br>mentioned earlier that seventy percent<br>of americans have an unfavorable Trump<br>lifted by the seen him nothing room and<br>unfavorable view Clinton as well that's<br>a big 8 15 to see it's still majority of<br>American an unfavorable view door<br>Clinton as well so she will probably buy<br>the lesser of two evils to be slightly<br>provocative though I think the beasts<br>can run into it but the Republicans is<br>probably Trump and we're trying to talk<br>about this further because he's been<br>because that I know you go to Sunday's a<br>chameleon and he will do and say<br>anything yet he's not vanilla if he<br>wants he does have a war chest of<br>billions of dollars that he's not using<br>he's a cheapskate which the party why is<br>not doing better if he chooses you know<br>he can put running at a time he is real<br>time but I don't see any other<br>Republican lady for a good has a shot of<br>being confident well I i would prefer to<br>see Clinton elected but I have been<br>unhappy with almost every election since<br>nineteen sixty-eight particularly and<br>I'm affecting to be very unhappy with<br>this election well well I expect<br>somebody that I don't want to wait<br>because you that has been my experience<br>election after election after elected or<br>get it well I'm hoping that Clinton will<br>be only his right so maybe shouldn't<br>hope yeah oh well Hubert Humphrey well<br>the problem there are number of problems<br>here but um if<br>Trump does not get the nomination he<br>could well split the Republicans voted<br>yes and that would be an A+ for Clinton<br>if he does get the nomination as you<br>said and I think Clinton is assuring<br>yeah yeah week we thought you know when<br>he's your only six months ago and he<br>continues to disregard it yeah<br>expectation soon as we perfected rule<br>book for the national election i think i<br>will hold on hold on we just the denial<br>of my I can't support Bernie Sanders<br>because of his views on gun legislation<br>I think that the personal safety and the<br>freedom of Americans is directly<br>jeopardized by all of these gun total<br>crazies and so yeah I think Hillary<br>Clinton is by far the best although i'm<br>chasing by that obama dr. an article in<br>the Atlantic so Allison you should weigh<br>in and you know just just put in what<br>know I'd be going with Clinton at this<br>point but I you know I'm just watching<br>closely just to see I still don't<br>understand how the whole system works so<br>this is family I think Americans don't<br>like dynasties and they don't want they<br>didn't like the bush dynasty but he<br>wasn't actually elected we their real<br>questions about the Florida election in<br>the first bone and real questions about<br>the Ohio election in the second one and<br>they will not like a Clinton dynasty<br>today hey Bill working behind the scenes<br>asks well he's not exactly I'm the<br>sensation well I'd like to thank you all<br>for your participation participation<br>today Danziger una linda johnston and<br>eva collins and thank you to people who<br>sent in questions i hope you've been<br>enlightened by the debates and if you<br>haven't been enlightened i hope you<br>enjoyed it so to send those me to
