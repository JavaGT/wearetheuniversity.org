who<br>don't know the schedule Mark's been here<br>at the business school since before 8<br>o'clock this morning<br>we've run him from audience to audience<br>and certainly extracted more than our<br>pound of flesh but never one to not take<br>two pounds when you can get it he's<br>graciously agreed to have a chat with me<br>this evening and I'm looking forward to<br>the conversation and to in turn after a<br>bit of chat we'll turn it to the<br>audience to see if you have any<br>questions that you would like to ask<br>directly to mark so with that said here<br>we go mark again thanks for being here<br>the proverbial thing to ask CEOs is what<br>keeps you up at night but I want to<br>focus that down a little bit further<br>because you've been billed as a<br>turnaround specialist excellent in<br>crisis management there was a news story<br>this week that said you were a kiwi but<br>Kiwis are birds that look under leaves<br>for worms and they weren't very sure you<br>were a Kiwi they thought you were more<br>like a raptor I think was the the<br>language the article is very unkind its<br>victim yeah so I've been keen to see<br>who's going to show up tonight the Kiwi<br>or the Raptor or somewhere in between so<br>what I'd like for you to do is tell me a<br>little bit in that special context of<br>crisis or turn around what keeps you up<br>at night what really worries you how<br>would you pay attention to during that<br>time<br>I mean well Thanksgiving Kevin and I had<br>a chat yesterday so we were discussing<br>what we're going to talk about tonight<br>what keeps me up at night it's more the<br>things you can't control and you can<br>look at it and you look at it whether<br>it's business or whatever most things<br>than business ecchi you can control oh<br>you can control your people you can<br>control your balance sheet you can<br>control pretty much most aspects of it<br>it's the unknown things it's the<br>geopolitical stuff it's the wars it's<br>their floods<br>it's the events<br>that blow you off course and there was a<br>guy I'm Harold Macmillan he was a<br>British prime minister I think in the<br>50s and he was asked once as a prime<br>minister what are the things that blow<br>you off course and he said events dear<br>boy events and that's pretty much the<br>same or a sitter group today there's<br>that other global Statesman and<br>intellectual by the name of Mike Tyson<br>and and almost as good as Donald Trump<br>yeah he's like these Americans they do<br>it well right and but he said when he<br>was asked about plans because of course<br>you can plan for many things and they<br>they asked Mike Tyson about his<br>opponents and he said every opponent I<br>fight has a plan to beat me until I<br>punched them in the mouth and when you<br>think of it that way every CEO in the<br>world gets punched in the metaphorical<br>mouth and it's generally events that you<br>can't think of an you can't control and<br>I guess I've built my career and trying<br>to clean up some of those misses created<br>by events that a lot of CEOs didn't<br>either think about or maybe they managed<br>their company poorly so when those<br>events came up they got punched too many<br>times a month so take me to the global<br>financial crisis you're at aia at the<br>time and a division a unit a business of<br>AIG and an organization that famously<br>got in trouble during the GFC tell us a<br>little bit about those events and your<br>reaction as the leader of AIA<br>within the parent AIG and managing that<br>conflict and the sort of the<br>multiplicity of do I do what the parent<br>says do I do what's best for the<br>business have talked about there's some<br>stories behind that but when you have a<br>look at it so AI geez problems were<br>entirely foreseeable yeah<br>a company that got in trouble and it<br>shouldn't have got in trouble it did<br>things with its business said it just<br>shouldn't have done and destroyed a<br>legacy for many generations of<br>management leaders before it but if she<br>can picture it this way Kevin ifyour I<br>was sitting at home in a leather chair<br>and I was on the phone to three<br>different three different people there's<br>the head of the New York Fed the head of<br>the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the<br>head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority<br>and it was 4:30 in the morning when it<br>happens you know you have a problem and<br>they were all on the phone at the same<br>time and I rang up my team of key<br>members of my team and said we need to<br>meet the parents collapsed I don't think<br>it's going to be around come morning yes<br>so in your parent company collapses and<br>by the time I got into the office that<br>was queues outside every office we had<br>around Asia it was the headline story<br>I'm seeing in when I've gone to the<br>office there's camera crews everywhere<br>and it was total chaos and what do you<br>do I mean there's no books being I was<br>talking to some of the faculty today<br>there's no books being listen on earth<br>there's you've never done that before<br>I'd at least I'd never done it before<br>it's not something you want to do too<br>many times either and and that really is<br>a crisis and when you think about it<br>that way just for context AIA at the<br>time owned 43% of the long end of the<br>Thailand government bonds so the whole<br>Thai economy was leveraged to us I guess<br>sort of we'd fallen over that would have<br>fallen over and it was a huge company<br>there's 300,000 staff and agents or what<br>about their families or you know then<br>how many customers it was maybe 25<br>million and so that sort of focuses your<br>mind and the whole team and had an<br>extraordinary team of people at that<br>time but the whole team no one went home<br>for weeks I literally didn't go home for<br>14 days I don't think I had a full day<br>off in eight and a half months and<br>it was an extraordinary time that I<br>don't think you could do it I don't<br>think I could do it again because<br>physically immensely it was just too<br>tough and there was as you say there was<br>on one side you had a parent company<br>wanted to port put their hands and then<br>take all our capital and money and being<br>backed by the US government and on the<br>other side you have a fiduciary duty to<br>all the countries which were operated<br>them and if they're taken the money out<br>then AAA would have gone broke and it<br>was on the edge because of what the<br>parents had done that was on the edge<br>and it was an extraordinary time in our<br>history and the market turmoil was<br>seeing now just isn't even really close<br>to what you saw in 2008 not even really<br>close yeah you when we're talking<br>yesterday you talked about putting a<br>ring fence around AIA and that later a I<br>became I think the largest IPO in<br>history maybe still the second largest<br>after Alibaba but conceptually this<br>notion of telling the parent no I'm<br>building the ring fence around how did<br>you come to that you said quite a bit to<br>me about the importance of doing the<br>right thing so could you build on that<br>statement a little bit your thinking<br>around doing the right thing if you care<br>for what I say straight talk right<br>exactly that's why I'm here<br>I mean you had at that stage I had phone<br>calls from the then CEO this is a few<br>months a the chief and then CEO of AIG<br>and said you know we want we want the<br>cash and we saw the financial crisis<br>coming so would stockpiled quite a few<br>billion of cash and then the company and<br>the CEO city wanted it he picked up the<br>phone and he's yelling at me down the<br>phone<br>and they said in our quotes if you don't<br>do it I'll fire your ass so I hang up on<br>them which as you do with your boss<br>remember probably which probably wasn't<br>the smartest thing I've ever done to be<br>fair but I take this view in business<br>that if you make your judgments on on a<br>value set first then and just do what's<br>right then you will come out of<br>like way and I had a team who through<br>that whole period we we I think we only<br>lost one person through that quite<br>extraordinary period these people were<br>working you know 20 hours and the day<br>and it wasn't there wasn't for many<br>woman paying them more but it in an<br>environment like that everyone actually<br>does want to do the right thing and then<br>a crisis most people do want to do the<br>right thing and and a lot back and that<br>I'm still in contact with many of those<br>people when you go through a time like<br>that you build next door and we bond<br>with some of those people<br>how about decision making how does<br>decision-making change in a period of<br>crisis or turmoil see I believe that<br>consensus and crisis are two words that<br>don't go together if you have a look<br>through any crisis people want to be led<br>and whether and in that case it was my<br>responsibility whether I was right or<br>wrong isn't the point because if I'm<br>wrong someone will find out soon enough<br>and the worst thing you can do is be<br>sort of paralyzed by fear and too many<br>companies when they go through a crisis<br>won't make a decision and many years ago<br>it was that you in Oakland I heard<br>Norman Schwarzkopf speak member Stormin<br>Norman and Stormin Norman said when in<br>charge take charge and that was sort of<br>his philosophy that if you get it wrong<br>you'll find out soon enough and I<br>believe in the crisis it is the same<br>that you've got to make a decision if<br>you get it wrong then you'll change it<br>quickly enough but if you don't make a<br>decision that's the thing there that she<br>causes organizations particularly large<br>organizations to to spiral them and<br>that's when they when you make bad<br>decisions and and the the organization<br>goes down and that sets of what happened<br>and how many times you see that a lot so<br>when yeah so putting this together is 14<br>days I don't go home eight and a half<br>months I don't have a day off doing the<br>same thing with my team becoming a more<br>authoritarian leader I think is yes yeah<br>but I mean how do you how do you<br>maintain your own resilience and the<br>reason<br>to the team in such circumstances I know<br>you talked about doing the right thing<br>and I'm sure that's a powerful motivator<br>but there must be some other key tips<br>you might have for us around that I mean<br>actually one of us one of the students<br>today in the session we had this evening<br>she asked me that same question I should<br>have been and I mean my view was it's<br>normally about balance normally I would<br>handle that by keeping fit and that sort<br>of stuff<br>it is about gained the support network<br>though I mean it's some whether it's the<br>people in your team or you know coming<br>home to New Zealand which is you know<br>there's always a drawback to New Zealand<br>and New Zealand one of those places that<br>I'm only here for three days this time<br>but the sort of place and why not look<br>like it but it's still a place that sort<br>of recharge your batteries and you get a<br>better sense of what's important than<br>their balance and stuff and in your<br>career but at that sort of time we<br>didn't actually have time to think so<br>there was some people in my team who I<br>thought were really good who just<br>cracked under the strain and because<br>there was one person who was<br>professionally I want to say as feel but<br>he was one the best in this field<br>although it was a technical sort of<br>field but he was used to a very<br>structured role and in the crisis you<br>haven't got that because there's no book<br>you can pick up to understand that and<br>there were some of the people I thought<br>were pretty average who and the crisis<br>were just quite outstanding and yeah I<br>see a guy there Andy who was with me in<br>Hongkong over that time and remembers<br>some of the sort of stuff but in in a<br>crisis that makes some people survive<br>and some don't and you see you see that<br>government's too so you're in you've had<br>a lot of experience in Southeast Asia<br>before going to Aviva and we will get<br>around to Aviva I promise but China is a<br>country of much interest to Kiwis in<br>general because there are a large<br>trading partner increasingly large<br>trading partner what observations might<br>you share with us around China around<br>allegations that there's more corruption<br>there than other places and tell us a<br>little bit about China you know and set<br>my career I've realized now that in the<br>West we have quite a myopic view on<br>China and the East I mean and London<br>people still talk about Asia as the Far<br>East oh did you go to the Far East now<br>when you're in Asia it's not that far<br>and we have this cultural bias and we<br>think that China's corrupt everything<br>else I can tell you for example in my<br>world and shunt Ford as far greater in<br>the UK than I ever saw in Indonesia<br>you know what place for orders in the UK<br>is 27 times whiplash levels then France<br>that's why I tease my British colleagues<br>and says so British necks of 27 times<br>weaker than French nets the French agree<br>with me the British don't on there but<br>if you have a look at China it's or any<br>pile in Asia and all the cultures were<br>obviously a hugely diverse in Asia but<br>China is going through a tough period<br>and there's implications for New Zealand<br>on that so you know about six months ago<br>I was being interviewed on CNBC and I<br>had said then that I thought that China<br>was going to take what I called a<br>Shanghai a sabbatical and meaning that<br>China has gone through 20 years of<br>growth the first 10 years with<br>double-digit growth the second 10 years<br>every year that growth has declined in<br>the growth at the moment they say is 5.7<br>and according to our methods probably<br>more like 3.7 and so China now is having<br>to relearn and retool so you've had<br>management teams that they've only ever<br>operated in the market where you could<br>get 10 or living the 12% growth now what<br>and they think three or four or five<br>percent growth<br>they think it's negative they think it's<br>a huge recession and so I call it<br>Shanghai sabbatical because I think that<br>China needs to relearn how<br>managed in the lower growth environment<br>the factors that child is no longer<br>cheap to manufacture goods and the fact<br>is that it's not consuming the same iron<br>ore so Australia's struggling there<br>factors they're not importing as much<br>commodities generally and you kissing<br>dairy getting hit in a massive way here<br>and you know what I don't think it's<br>going to change to 2019 or 2020 and so<br>when you have a look at things like<br>dairy prices in New Zealand it's going<br>to be a tough few years and we've been<br>and we've been operating on these sort<br>of prices in New Zealand for quite some<br>time and I think this is a problem so<br>you've had an economy that's been<br>fuelled by here by a high dairy prices<br>and the Christchurch rebuild that<br>companies like comes like mine paid for<br>you know a thinks why 15 here was it was<br>quite good but that's what were there<br>for<br>but you know it's in the top five<br>biggest financial to biggest natural<br>disasters in history the Christchurch<br>earthquake in the top five in history<br>economically I'm talking about<br>financially and so you can see when you<br>get an event that big it does fuel the<br>economy and yeah I think we're gonna<br>take you down a pretty good job in the<br>last period of time take the mix of job<br>but it was fueled by Christchurch and it<br>was fueled by cannot process and as<br>China does retreat for a number of years<br>it's going to be a tough period and<br>you've got an oil glut you've got<br>geopolitical problems around the world<br>there's going to be some issues because<br>economics typically breeds discontent<br>which typically breeds war and you asked<br>what keeps me up at night those sort of<br>things I think I made you worries<br>globally at the moment it's fully events<br>my boy events my dear boy evidence there<br>you go all right so you you've done this<br>great turnaround in Asia in many ways<br>the IPO of a I saved IIT probably the<br>world is your oyster at this point and<br>you landed a vivo why Aviva what attract<br>no it's okay yes for two years well I<br>and that I was contracted that anyway<br>but I took two years off and it was<br>great my tennis game improved what you<br>needed to improve markedly I didn't know<br>if you wanted to tell them about the two<br>years off so I yeah but yeah I went to a<br>Vivaan Aviva's one of those iconic<br>brands in the UK we haven't really<br>gotten we haven't had a business here<br>for a long time I used to own here think<br>was state and in NZ died and the<br>community Union at one stage and in<br>other businesses but it's now conk<br>business been around for three hundred<br>and twenty years so it started in 1696<br>so the Great Fire of London was 1666 and<br>in those days it was the start of an<br>etch effect fire insurance was a company<br>called hand and hand which is a<br>delightful name when you think about it<br>and in those days there was no such<br>thing as a fire brigade<br>so you'd hit you insure your house<br>there's a beginning of some insurance in<br>1696 and above the door you'd have<br>something called a fire mark and it's<br>made of bronze or copper and that were<br>heads these sort of coat of arms and<br>that case hand in hand and we'd have<br>look out so we don't the fire stations<br>there wasn't at fire stations and you'd<br>see smoke in the city of London and the<br>square mile and the run around with<br>their axes and they would put out the<br>fire but only if you had a fire mark if<br>not bye-bye and so that was long before<br>fire brigades and in fact in my office I<br>have the breastplate from one of the<br>first firemen's uniforms and on the back<br>of it and they had all these ornate<br>uniforms these big sort of ornate<br>helmets and it was it was like this it<br>was by the shoes of a military uniform<br>and there's the breastplate so anything<br>we got lifts in 1696 and then the back<br>of it has scratched Londinium 1696<br>number three station and on the back of<br>him so it's a remarkable sort of history<br>and Aviva like so many other<br>organizations hubris got the better of<br>them and they made some dumb financial<br>decisions so technically the company is<br>amazing as well was telling what the way<br>third but they invested five billion<br>pounds and the US and<br>at all or me I just made some dumb<br>decisions and thought really short term<br>and if you think short-term and a<br>long-term business you're going to make<br>mistakes and they did and so when I went<br>there and it's a company that's its<br>assets are about three five hundred<br>fifty billion US give or take so it's<br>got a big asset pool but the central<br>liquidity the amount of cash left at the<br>group Center was only about 200 million<br>was just isn't enough and for coming<br>like that we had capital or 3.6 billion<br>which was about probably a third of what<br>it needed so they asked me and to go and<br>try and sort it out and it's not<br>something you take lightly you couldn't<br>I went through about 42 hours of<br>discussions with the board about whether<br>I was a good fit and whether my thought<br>they were good for me and vice versa but<br>that's and that's what I did but<br>remarkable company I mean I love history<br>and you can't beat history of 320 years<br>the only older company we're aware of<br>that's still working the UK as a company<br>called the Bank of England which started<br>in 1694 and and most people don't know<br>the Bank of England a co-working bank<br>and despite us being like the reserve<br>bank it said she's still working banking<br>as has a couple of counselors and the<br>office that still work you mentioned the<br>word iconic in describing Aviva what do<br>you think are the ingredients of an<br>iconic company and you also talked about<br>thinking long term versus short term how<br>does one think long term build an iconic<br>company keep those principles employees<br>and it's about value said isn't it so if<br>you ever look at successful sports teams<br>religion and business they have three<br>ingredients so I believe that are<br>totally common across the three they<br>have icons there's a little team that<br>did pretty well on the UK last year<br>portals could be in the UK last year the<br>All Blacks they've got night hunt so the<br>black jersey and the silver fern<br>religion has whatever religion has<br>different icons with us across or<br>whatever and our corner companies Apple<br>has an apple<br>so that's icons the rituals you have<br>rituals with us the hacker whether it's<br>religions got all sorts of rituals in<br>that and so and the other one is a value<br>set so whether you have a business or<br>whether you have sports team the value<br>said in the All Blacks is you know that<br>temporary custodians of the jersey and<br>and they never believe they're going to<br>lose and same with religion errs and<br>value set and same with business and<br>each of those three things is important<br>so at Aviva that one of the first things<br>I did other than set the vision was<br>actually with the team determine what<br>our value sitters and in our case<br>there's only four let that mean things I<br>honesty integrity well that's yeah blah<br>blah blah that's all very nice but it's<br>those are hygiene factors everyone just<br>to be in business you should have<br>honesty and integrity and hard work and<br>that so it's what you want to<br>differentiate your company and in this<br>case what we did we'd four values one of<br>them was I stole unashamedly from the<br>All Blacks which was create legacy or be<br>a good and sister which was you know<br>we're at temporary guardians of a three<br>hundred twenty year old organization and<br>so we said we want all our decisions to<br>be long-term not short-term if I want<br>short-term decisions I'll just put the<br>dividend up tomorrow the stock price<br>will jump really quickly and then what<br>now so it's that sort stuff the second<br>one was care more it just means do the<br>right thing<br>don't worry about the regulator's say or<br>government's or shareholders just do the<br>right thing and if you do the right<br>thing you're not going to get in trouble<br>as a business the third one was never<br>rest what sometimes means not get much<br>sleep which is true some of the time but<br>more often it means about just always be<br>unhappy with the status quo just never<br>be satisfied with where the business has<br>always been looking to improve it or<br>their customer experience and less<br>interest and the last one is one we call<br>kill complexity and when I was debating<br>these values with my board at dinner one<br>and one of my mentors is a local John<br>McFarlane is now the chairman of<br>Barclays it used to be the CEO veins at<br>Bank and we were debating the values and<br>the board hated the kill complexity and<br>summer border so much you can't have the<br>world kill in a value and I said that's<br>why I'm a CEO and it's my decision<br>that's not yours<br>there was one of my less consulted of<br>moments and this debate raged for about<br>twenty minutes I mean that's literally<br>that's so but in a fun sort of way and<br>then John McFarlane showing the wisdom<br>over of a fine chairman and he said<br>light enough to bay they said Mark I<br>agree with the rest of the board you<br>can't use the word kill in a value he<br>said I prefer the word murder but I mean<br>it is about the values are your<br>decision-making criteria they're the<br>they're the thing that guides because<br>people will change and your strategy<br>will change but your value set shouldn't<br>and a business and that's the thing that<br>should be enduring and and I set quite a<br>number of people in my senior team<br>because they weren't consistent with<br>that values that I wanted I don't mean<br>they were unethical I don't mean they<br>didn't have integrity that's not what I<br>mean but you know was about thinking<br>short term rather long term that was<br>about not just really doing the right<br>thing I think we all did the right thing<br>but it's if they weren't consistent with<br>the values said I don't care how good<br>they are then they can't work in the<br>organization and we let go of a lot of<br>people because of because of a value<br>system yeah returning to that long-term<br>notion and I'll get this story wrong but<br>I think you were the first business<br>person to address the UN or something<br>Jim Maceda yeah talk a little bit about<br>that experience how it came about how it<br>remember it sort of went sideways for a<br>few moments and then yeah I mean it's<br>quite intimidating I don't know whether<br>anyone's seeing you the big green plinth<br>they have at the UN and it's this<br>massive room it's about there's no<br>pillars in it and it's only how many<br>times the size of this room with wires<br>but it's<br>huge and a couple of years ago I spoke<br>at an economist conference I was talking<br>about sustainability and long-term<br>thinking in business and what business<br>is there for because I believe business<br>isn't there to make money that's a<br>necessary byproduct of it but you got to<br>have some bigger purposes in the<br>business there's a got to be a use for<br>the business and it's talking about that<br>and then at lead there was I got invited<br>to speak of the UN subgroup called the<br>Global Compact and I did that speech and<br>then from there they launched something<br>called the global sustainable<br>development goals which was banking<br>moons I guess that's the thing that his<br>tenure will be remembered for and so<br>they ran me up through my team and said<br>would you speak at it and of course I<br>said yes<br>and that was the same day the Pope spoke<br>and and most of the sort of global<br>leaders spoke so I don't get intimidated<br>that easy but it was a bit and then the<br>night before they rang me up and I flew<br>to New York for and not for their me up<br>and said Aichi you can't speak which is<br>nice can I just flying to New York and<br>they said you can't speak and they said<br>because businesspersons never spoken at<br>the General Assembly before you've got<br>to be you've got to be a political<br>figure to speak and so I said okay but I<br>still got an invite and it went and<br>heard all these speakers speak and then<br>we're in a break and they get a call on<br>my mobile and they said oh we've changed<br>tremendous right and so it's just the<br>United Nations and following the pulpit<br>well yeah and you go out and I followed<br>the Modi and you go in the room behind<br>this and you go in there and you meeting<br>all sorts of interesting people and then<br>then they hauled you out there and until<br>that moment I had no idea how long I was<br>going to speak for and so I stood up in<br>front of that green plinth and there's a<br>clock that's ticking down from five<br>minutes and I found out later that<br>everyone gets five minutes just no one<br>splitter sticks to it and in the<br>political world Modi spoke for 18<br>minutes 13 minutes over and the<br>president said he had one minute extra<br>300 million people and but it was it was<br>it was unique experience but you realize<br>that the bureaucracy of government<br>they're focused on quite a narrow part<br>of the world and the goals are the right<br>thing I mean that's it's talking about<br>trying to eradicate poverty and climate<br>change in the 17 goals and it's all good<br>stuff but you can't achieve it through<br>the public sector it's impossible to<br>achieve that they want and the only way<br>to achieve what they're looking for in<br>terms of the goals and sustainability is<br>through business and business capitalism<br>in terms of my view has been the biggest<br>force for liberation history look at<br>China alone six hundred eighty million<br>people win above the poverty line in the<br>last decade that wasn't communism that<br>did that that was capitalism and in my<br>view if you look economically China is<br>probably one of the most capitalist<br>nations on earth of the moment you know<br>there's a few other issues there as well<br>but they work delve into tonight but in<br>terms of economically making a mistake<br>entrepreneurialism is alive and well far<br>more so the most European markets that<br>are working now you know when I when I<br>got the job at Aviva I was having lunch<br>with one of the main Chinese banks<br>chairman and he said what are you doing<br>that for what are you going to Europe<br>for and he said mark if you want<br>capitalism<br>come to China if you want socialism go<br>to the UK but he wasn't being funny and<br>economically economically there's no<br>doubt that for many years China has been<br>economically not politically and I<br>certainly differentiate the two but<br>economically parts of Asia really like<br>we were in the Western will in probably<br>twenty years ago in terms of the ability<br>to innovate and I think a lot of our<br>society New Zeeland probably does better<br>than most but particularly in Europe<br>Europe has lost a lot of the ability to<br>innovate and there's something that is<br>worrying a lot of people in Europe and<br>the EU because it has become a huge<br>bureaucracy well mark you've uh I guess<br>I could go on and on and ask you a bunch<br>of questions but you've been generous<br>with your time talking to me on the<br>phone when you were back in the UK I got<br>to pepper you with lots of questions at<br>the coffee yesterday at the time today<br>so I think this is the right time to<br>turn to the audience and say do you have<br>any questions that you would like to ask<br>mark<br>mmm well I just have my results last<br>Thursday actually so shareholders<br>particularly the UK are extraordinarily<br>focused on dividends and short term and<br>also what I did last week and there was<br>also pretty good last week so I was able<br>to I guess but basically I went to them<br>and said you know I could have paid you<br>whatever dividend I liked because it was<br>also really good but you know what I<br>want shareholders who want to think long<br>term we just killed our quarterly<br>reporting last week announced that we<br>just clear on quarter reporting so we'll<br>just do mid-year and full-year and take<br>out the other two because if you do<br>quarterly reporting just focus you on<br>such a short timeframe you're going to<br>make the long decisions and my point to<br>shareholders was that's how we got into<br>the mess a few years ago with<br>shareholders always want more<br>information they always want short-term<br>returns and you know what I want<br>shareholders who want long-term returns<br>that doesn't mean you can't get them UFT<br>after year because I still expect to get<br>overturns year after year after year and<br>we've done pretty well over the last<br>couple of years because we're saying you<br>guys might create legacy value again<br>it's about thinking long term any of<br>them but shareholders are getting more<br>and more short term they you've got the<br>way that and we've got fund managers in<br>the room here it's see but that's it's<br>the way that fund managers and you get<br>other models that buy and sell stocks<br>and millisecond and data means that<br>they're thinking short more short and<br>shorter term and I think this is a big<br>problem I think there's a problem for<br>business suffering is a problem for<br>government I think it's a problem for<br>capital there's so much capital in the<br>world you know how do you manage it so<br>there is extraordinary pressure on it<br>but I make no excuses right now I say<br>well if you want short term was also the<br>best of me and it's interesting though<br>that we ask so that the investor basis<br>sort of swapped itself up and and that's<br>the sort of best as you want there's so<br>much liquidity in the world at the<br>moment looking for a home and when<br>you've got interest rates as low as they<br>are I mean if you get I said last week<br>we target on now<br>we want 5% growth I mean we've got 20%<br>less you actually but we're targeting 5%<br>right after year after year after year<br>after year<br>and it doesn't really matter what the<br>maybe I'm doing a speech on that next<br>week actually it's it's these two I've<br>got a right of way home in the plane but<br>there's two big referendums on the<br>moment there's the EU well there's one a<br>bit of flag here right and then I voted<br>as well by the way the so Brixton is a<br>big deal in the UK and the it's been<br>around for a while and everyone's<br>looking at for those who and close to<br>the debate bricks it's the British exit<br>from the EU or the referendum on that<br>and everyone's looking at the EU through<br>an economic lens and I get that but the<br>reality is it was set up not for<br>economics was set up to stop war and<br>conflict and it's been extraordinarily<br>successful there's not been a conflict<br>between member states of the EU since it<br>was set up 50 years ago it's been the<br>longest period of peace in Europe I'm<br>talking about the Member States in<br>history in history so it's been<br>extraordinarily successful so should the<br>end I'm not a fan of Brussels just to be<br>clear I think it's probably the most<br>bureaucratic organization I've ever<br>witnessed<br>and it needs to be reformed there's no<br>doubt about that but if Europe leaves<br>the EU there is a lot of economic<br>impacts to it so our view as a company<br>is that the risks of leaving are just<br>too great and that doesn't mean I don't<br>think that the UK should build up a<br>trade with other countries and you know<br>countries like New Zealand where an old<br>friend of the UK and so when the<br>Winston's the you you they sort of<br>forgot about us well they need to<br>rebuild some of those tires they need to<br>build ties with Asia and Singapore and<br>Malaysia and so on the UK there's more<br>trade with I don't know Belgium than it<br>does involve Southeast Asia and that's a<br>problem because it's so economically so<br>focused on the<br>EU and it is a problem but our view and<br>our companies view is that we're better<br>off enough and we do have to take a view<br>because we've got so much investment<br>funds around Europe we do have to take a<br>bunam so I don't know I think that<br>British people are inherently<br>conservative and you can tell by the<br>rugby and they'll inherently conserve<br>them but because of their conservatism I<br>suspect probably I hope they will stand<br>I get to vote on that one too I get to<br>vote load the place so well here in the<br>middle I'm talking more crisis but I<br>hate consensus management I think that's<br>the disease and business which makes it<br>my about I'll tell my very first<br>executive meeting that I was chairing<br>this is going back to January 2013 and<br>they walked in the room and I admit them<br>all the week before and there's about a<br>dozen people and it was the most bizarre<br>discussion so someone come up and say<br>well we've got a business case to spend<br>20 million pounds on this and even<br>though yes yes yes and there was no<br>challenge and there was no pushback and<br>that sound like consensus on that place<br>and I was listening to this the next<br>person would say you know I've got a 30<br>million case for this and I'd like the<br>group's<br>agreement to this and then the third<br>person who are fired the next day yeah<br>well she said I've got a case for this<br>and I'd like the group's blessing I said<br>oh I'm not this isn't a democracy you<br>all paid a lot of money make a decision<br>and the rest of you should be<br>challenging that decision and if you<br>don't change it says you know I've no<br>use to me and basically kicked their<br>whanau and got the men and half the work<br>there the next day and I mean that quite<br>literally and if you're in a crisis<br>situation you've got to change<br>you know management theory I think says<br>you've got to change about 40% that<br>you'd make it work but so my style is is<br>not consensus but it is consultative and<br>there's a big big difference so I<br>believe in consultation and we started<br>up a digital garage and it's the<br>furthest where we do all our digital<br>businesses and you know after 18 months<br>it's got 1.3 billion pounds of revenue<br>so it's growing really really fast and<br>but that's the total antithesis of a<br>hierarchy you know if I wore a tiler<br>suit in there in fact I did once and<br>they cut my tie off and you you got to<br>make those sort of icons a change so I<br>am quite consultative but there's a big<br>difference between consensus and<br>consultation a huge difference of people<br>are in a leadership role then they<br>should make decisions and they should<br>make sure that people below them can<br>make decisions there was a hand just in<br>here somewhere<br>yes sir and we'll come back to you on<br>the background and then I'll look this<br>way<br>I think it varies market by market in<br>country by country so and some some<br>markets China for example people still<br>would trust a bank and the UK banks are<br>probably the least trusted organizations<br>and some of it well deserved the things<br>that went on and the GFC were<br>inexcusable the decisions that were made<br>in the leverage that were taken but<br>making a mistake the GFC wasn't just<br>caused by the banks or companies like<br>AIG it was caused by a collision of dumb<br>policy and so macroeconomic policy and<br>micro regulation so regulators looking<br>at micro they were all just trying to<br>sort people do bad things and when the<br>risks that bring economies or businesses<br>down and generally macro issues so the<br>large economic issues so in the US you<br>had a government that decided that<br>everyone should be able to own their own<br>home now that's Noble and that's a nice<br>sentiment but paying people to give<br>their own home when they were never<br>going to be able to afford it just meant<br>that have created a crisis for those<br>individuals lives that wreck their lives<br>as well and then you had a banking<br>system that leveraged up there to made<br>extraordinary amounts of money and so<br>you had just bad decisions all along so<br>I think different brands and different<br>organizations have different levels of<br>trust for the problems that have ever<br>had the one and I there was plenty of<br>gifts I didn't want to open on Christmas<br>Day that my predecessor left me the best<br>thing they left me was this wonderful<br>brand you know Aviva's got a ten percent<br>unprompted recall in China had again<br>timber Sonam fronted recall in China and<br>as partly to do with our JV partner who<br>had Natori 700 million customers but<br>Kafka whose ojb pub but so it's<br>different in different brands in<br>different countries in the UK though<br>banking is still as<br>come the punching bag for every<br>journalist or politician that once<br>remember and frankly it's time that they<br>moved on from it one of the biggest<br>banks that had a huge ballot in the UK<br>is one called Royal Bank of Scotland a<br>BS incidentally which is run by a close<br>mate of mine who's a Kiwi you guy could<br>lost McEwan and if you have a look at<br>the UK financial industry of the top ten<br>financial companies in the UK just about<br>all of them are run by farness which is<br>understood their self the lady in the<br>it's hard to work out the people that<br>they're going to be successful or not<br>but I've hired some of them I must<br>confess back again it's I think the<br>things you can have a plan for Christ<br>it's like Mike Tyson said I mean plans<br>are great but there's not the plans<br>themselves so I can guarantee in a<br>crisis you will never use that plan and<br>regulators have this naive thing that<br>they think well you can do resolution<br>plan that's all good<br>what's important is the process to get<br>you there so one of the things I saved a<br>is with a fantastic project<br>infrastructure so on the morning when<br>all the when the parent collapsed we<br>were able to basically use that<br>infrastructure with built in terms of<br>crisis so we had 12 work streams and one<br>was on Capitol Mama's and regulation one<br>was on comms and and so on we had 12<br>different things and we were able to use<br>that infrastructure was basically<br>reporting infrastructure managing it and<br>people were used to working under<br>pressure and deadlines to get it done so<br>it's more the process than the actual<br>plan people put way too much faith in<br>plans<br>and the only thing I can guarantee is<br>the plan you'll never use it in the<br>crisis so one of the other things that<br>worried about constantly in terms of big<br>business now was data in data security<br>and I think most of all just really<br>naive on data security and we do<br>sessions where cross the sessions where<br>we assume that someone's stolen our<br>customer data and it's put online with<br>it and we go through scenario testing so<br>the scenario testings worth it but the<br>actual plan you're gonna put behind it<br>isn't this what makes it my chair is<br>angled this way so I'm gonna look this<br>way for a second do you have a question<br>it's not their best decision it's been<br>extraordinarily successful because<br>there's a few brands in the world that<br>untainted sporting brands like that one<br>and the wind loss ratio I mean people<br>don't realize you when I read the press<br>here and the reading use an impressively<br>day for what it's worth<br>there's always comments about what's in<br>the UK I can tell you that brands like<br>the All Blacks are legendary in the UK<br>people were there and respect it doesn't<br>mean they won't cheer for their own team<br>but the one that would say in the UK is<br>their extraordinarily good sports of<br>great play with us cricket or rugby<br>football not so much but of the some of<br>the sports and tennis they're<br>extraordinarily supportive and so my<br>understanding is and I still have a<br>number of people they keep in contact<br>with an Arg they things being<br>extraordinarily successful I remember<br>thinking was SEC allege that they put a<br>name on the front of L our black jersey<br>and any name but that one but I mean we<br>do mean sports sponsorship has its<br>moments we're pulling we've done a lot<br>of sports sponsorship in the past weeks<br>he pulling back from sports sponsorship<br>we we believe the Premiership the rugby<br>Premiership and the UK was sponsor<br>things like the stadium and Dublin I was<br>in Dublin two weeks ago and I went<br>through immigration and the woman there<br>said you know what are you here for<br>business who you work for Aviva she said<br>is that the stadium or an insurance<br>company but I guess the one and the same<br>and<br>which made me think of was working at<br>cost us quite a few years got a lot of<br>money but you know brand awareness<br>unprompted in the island was eighty-six<br>percent and last year I went to a game<br>and the stadium and I said take me to<br>lens download and the taxi driver said<br>oh you mean the Aviva so it's only known<br>as the Aviva so it can work for name<br>awareness but then if you have name<br>awareness the question on sponsorship<br>odd says then what and getting associate<br>with the All Blacks is great but it<br>still was at Wynyard million u.s. or<br>something give or take a year it's not<br>that's a lot of money so you need to<br>make sure you're getting a whole lot of<br>brand awareness for that but once you've<br>got the brand awareness and there's an<br>organisation Aviva and our markets has<br>extraordinary brand recall so now the<br>next thing for us is well what you want<br>that brand to stand for and how do you<br>do that I've just changed the<br>advertising and it was starting the UK<br>but it's going to be globally where 80%<br>of our spam was on TV as of this year<br>50% social media so 50% of advertisers<br>now social media we receive them from<br>search engine optimization - in our ads<br>are now basically in reality TV to the<br>point where some of the TV channels have<br>approached us wanting to make series on<br>them which it was interesting the self<br>so all their advertising on TV is<br>literally reality TV we get families<br>together and they'll do challenges and<br>you don't pay them we don't pay them a<br>cent everyone wants to be on TV so yeah<br>but sponsorship has its place I think<br>the sports sponsorship is going to<br>decrease though and the next 10 years I<br>think it's going to decrease<br>I think there's become much more risk in<br>it as the tennis world found out a<br>couple of days ago yes here in the blue<br>shirt<br>obviously you play tomorrow<br>yeah there was but it was really early<br>on and another couple of family here<br>tonight but there was my grandfather<br>actually when and I can't remember when<br>it was but he used to say it's a mark<br>when you're in a business position the<br>objective of that is and my dad used to<br>sever dad's here too early but I'd say<br>the objective of leadership is not to be<br>loved us be to be respected for doing<br>the right thing and if you take that as<br>you mentor and you don't do what's<br>populist or what's your few politicians<br>would do the same thing then you then<br>you make decisions in the global<br>financial crisis at one stage the AIG<br>tried to sell AIA to another company and<br>it was the wrong decision both companies<br>would have collapsed under the debt load<br>it would have been the biggest rights<br>issue or corporate takeover in uk's<br>history and it wouldn't have worked and<br>they offered me a lot of money to<br>support the deal<br>so if I've done that that means you're<br>selling yourself for something you don't<br>believe in so those are key decision<br>points and the minute you do that what's<br>the difference between that and other<br>unethical behavior right because you as<br>a CEO someone once told me that you cast<br>a long shadow and you forget so if I<br>turn up to work drunk war with a<br>hangover one morning and I turn up late<br>in the morning and turn up in the<br>meeting then you know everyone in that<br>meeting thinks that's okay and then<br>they'll do it and it goes through the<br>pyramid of the organization and but so<br>it's good and bad you spike so you're<br>bad points also cast that long shadow so<br>if I'm too tough on a meeting or I don't<br>treat someone as good as I should then<br>that my spikes that if I'm too edgy with<br>someone pushed them<br>to add the net cast long shadows well<br>but you've got to make those decisions<br>you make those decisions early and you<br>get known for really quickly and there's<br>a lot of CEOs in the world that I look<br>at and think well I definitely wouldn't<br>want to be like them and some of them<br>make a lot of money and some of their<br>company's really successful but you've<br>got to have there the New Zealanders<br>sort of known for that the Lada New<br>Zealand business leaders and nationally<br>in the end it's and it's New Zealand is<br>known for that sort of value set and as<br>a country we have very little corruption<br>at least it was one of them table said I<br>guess a long time ago now but but it's<br>it's a country that has a value set and<br>just like it's a bit of Meyerson the<br>sporting teams or business people or and<br>you don't see that anywhere so for me it<br>wasn't really a choice but you make that<br>choice you make that choice early I was<br>talking with some of the undergraduate<br>students today and I said what what you<br>want to be known for as a leader there<br>was some really smart concern today and<br>I said what do you want to be known for<br>and what's your point of differentiation<br>what's your brand what what decisions<br>are you going to make when it comes to<br>that point you have someone offers to<br>pay your hold of money to support a deal<br>you know that's wrong what would you do<br>I mean it's that sort of those sort of<br>decisions I just added that answer that<br>mark shared with me the other day that<br>he's never negotiated a pay package know<br>that he's just looked at the work and<br>said is this work I want to do and<br>figures that the pay will come along<br>Excel probably did with my dad for<br>pocket money I expect it's probably<br>about as far as it went but I think you<br>only paid me X which is sort of fun but<br>yeah I mean I haven't I've never<br>negotiated pay package in every year<br>even a few weeks ago in the year my<br>chairman comes up and says you know<br>here's the results and what do you think<br>of a person not gonna scuffle with you<br>I'm not gonna discuss my pay with my<br>board my dad knows he'd pay me what you<br>think's fear if you don't like if I<br>don't like it I got a choice - I guess<br>but and and I don't know and if you<br>think again long-term on that and<br>don't them short to him it changes the<br>whole dynamic lady here in the red and<br>now how do you keep itself I have to<br>and this window and the big screw up how<br>do you decide<br>I don't know I mean it's depends on<br>motivate you I've built my whole career<br>really doing jobs that probably no one<br>else wanted and then I guess I made a<br>career of doing these sort of<br>turnarounds and don't look as cleaning<br>up other people's messes I look at it as<br>where if you want to make a real<br>difference in the business it's actually<br>easier to do it when it's going wrong<br>and if it's going right I wouldn't<br>probably go to a business that was just<br>going remarkably well what value could I<br>add I think I'm better than a change<br>environment so and in terms of the<br>people that you inherit there's a basic<br>rule of thumb has talked about before<br>and a senior team if you're doing a turn<br>around you really have to get rid of at<br>least 40 percent of that team now<br>sometimes you promote from within I'm<br>not sort of leader that just goes and<br>brings hollow people I've worked with<br>before I think of my senior team I think<br>only three of them are from aia actually<br>so I don't you don't this I don't do<br>that that much always see that with a<br>couple of people that bring the culture<br>I want but you have to accept the people<br>and if people some people you also need<br>to find a few people that become the<br>cheerleaders for change so typically<br>I'll put one or two other people that<br>have been there forever and you know<br>they agent for change so for example my<br>general counsel who's a fantastic<br>general counsel and he was Kirsty Cooper<br>she's been in the company since general<br>excellent days she's been there I think<br>I might say about 27 years just a real<br>force for change she sort of understands<br>more about that company than I'll ever<br>know and she's got a great value set and<br>when people see someone like that that's<br>changed and really wants to follow the<br>direction that I wanted to go and brings<br>a whole lot of other people with them I<br>did the same thing at AIA and that one<br>it was the HR head and she'd been there<br>for a long time and probably was one of<br>the big barriers to change and then when<br>she became I'd almost call like a<br>cheerleader for change she was<br>then test it in fact you know is my HR<br>head for Aviva and Asia what is worth<br>and I did bring her with me but you get<br>people like that and that's that's how<br>you do it but you can't do it without<br>making the tough people decisions and<br>making them early and you can do that<br>you don't want to be ruthless on the<br>stuff you let people leave little speck<br>because some of them just aren't going<br>to fit it's not that this year they've<br>done anything wrong but they're just not<br>going to fit and I reckon I've only ever<br>made two mistakes from people but I made<br>them way too often one is far too slow<br>and promote too slow they're the only<br>two mistakes I think of it may but I've<br>made them way too often I still keep on<br>making them I've never regretted firing<br>someone too fast and I've never<br>regretted promoting someone to thirst<br>and my question is just now you<br>mentioned<br>so other than good JB's and Chinamen bad<br>JB's in China and the Commons really<br>good Kott Co and I'm pretty close to the<br>president and the chairman said he just<br>changed and met the new chairman and<br>Croft Co is quite an interesting company<br>so cough Co does a lot of food products<br>and things they I think might saying<br>they've got about 700 million customers<br>they were made a lot of the milk powder<br>and stuff so I don't think they were<br>delighted with New Zealand a couple<br>years ago with dramas we had at frontier<br>which I think caused them some problems<br>but China the key thing is the sort of<br>organization that it is they gotta have<br>the same values and what I mean by that<br>they've got to have the same vision of<br>where you want to take the business if<br>they haven't and if the management keeps<br>on changing really fast it's almost<br>impossible to manage EJB in China so we<br>have management control of that business<br>but we don't manage like that we see it<br>as a partnership last year I had the<br>chairman and the CEO and the senior team<br>spend a whole day with me in Hong Kong<br>looking at this strategy for the<br>business and this is a pretty small<br>business for the amanda's but it's<br>growing a sort of hundred percent a year<br>even last year the chamma sota had still<br>grew by 30 percent so that's turning<br>Thebans in over the last three years so<br>it's becoming quite big quite fast China<br>the key thing now wasn't language it<br>used to be it's not skill it used to be<br>it's more just about vision where people<br>want to take the company and with cough<br>codes it's a pretty good partnership so<br>so far so good but you know there's<br>there's a great book with many years ago<br>called 1 billion customers I remember<br>who wrote it some of the year faculty<br>you might know that and it was a story<br>about all the pitfalls of doing business<br>in China and all mistakes people make<br>and most people haven't made money in<br>China most haven't and we're lucky that<br>we're doing okay now but most there's<br>very few financial firms have made money<br>in China I know there are many more<br>questions but we've we've had you on the<br>the state since 8 o'clock this morning<br>and while you're not singing for<br>your supper we do want to take you for<br>some supper soon so I'm gonna take the<br>liberty of asking the last question<br>which is anyway<br>you've met you know a lot of famous<br>people Nelson Mandela Bill Clinton the<br>list goes on and on<br>who do you look to for inspiration who<br>inspires you is all year and I take<br>little things from different people and<br>offers often it's the things you don't<br>want to be as well that you learn the<br>most off I've had a couple of fabulous<br>mentors and mentors was talking students<br>they mentors aren't something you do<br>through a formal program and people that<br>I've asked for advice and this Chinese<br>guy in Hong Kong called Edmonds there<br>who really built the insurance industry<br>in Asia he's a remarkable man with<br>unbelievably high integrity and he built<br>he built AI and Asia and he hired me as<br>a successor and I still in fact I had<br>lunch with them just before Christmas<br>and people like that that you meet a<br>really good and you know when you have a<br>look at some of the everyone you take<br>something fun you mentioned Clinton and<br>I don't necessarily agree with his<br>politics but when you see Clinton the<br>way he looks at people and talks to<br>people is one of the few people I've met<br>where if you if you walked and he had a<br>paper bag over his head everyone would<br>still be looking at him and he's got<br>this ability to hold your gaze and think<br>you're the most important person in the<br>world when he's talking to you and it<br>has nothing to do with the fact he was<br>the president nothing whatsoever to do<br>with it I'm told he's always had that<br>school and you look at that and his<br>memory for people and names is quite<br>extraordinary and you look at people<br>like that and just the school sits they<br>they do and then you look at some other<br>people and think I definitely don't want<br>to be like that<br>and someone once told me you learn as<br>much from your bad boss as you would<br>from your good boss and if you take that<br>attitude and<br>I mean it but you look at leadership in<br>small ways you look at what the All<br>Blacks stood last year and the way they<br>conduct themselves off the field and on<br>the field during the World Cup was<br>extraordinary the mana they showed and<br>your man is one of those wonderful words<br>and that just hasn't got any translation<br>but the the manner and the humility they<br>showed them I think the leadership<br>position unless you can show that<br>humility in that respect well then<br>you're not going to be sustainable as a<br>leader it just isn't going to work well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
