coming and so<br>yes as Mel said my name is Peter and<br>this is Tamsin so basically tonight<br>we'll be covering something that we<br>could talk about for days and days and<br>days and days<br>so we have squeezed in a lot into this<br>presentation you don't have to worry<br>about taking notes if there's something<br>that you're particularly sort of rings<br>about for you by all means jot it down<br>but Courtney will be sending you the<br>PowerPoint so you can relax a little bit<br>but only a little bit because we will be<br>getting you to do some exercises as we<br>go along actually see some familiar<br>faces a few people who have been to some<br>of our other presentations so that's<br>great and my ones not working<br>click so this evening we're<br>actually going to start off with you<br>thinking about what your ideal job looks<br>like and why you might not have your<br>ideal job because I'm assuming if you're<br>here but you don't figure some sure<br>we'll look at very new skills at<br>interest because they are really<br>important and this whole exercise and<br>also working conditions jobs industries<br>things that you might not have thought<br>about then we'll bring it all together<br>with one particular career theory and at<br>the end we will give you sort of like<br>some hide behind the fella will give you<br>some useful websites and tips<br>okay so presumably you're here some of<br>you will be here and big thinking about<br>what to do and there's some obstacles in<br>your way some of you will have actually<br>already moved past some of those<br>obstacles and sort of like will be sort<br>of achieving some milestones and we'll<br>have actually a goal that you're hitting<br>for I'm assuming some of you won't<br>actually know what that goal looks like<br>yeah you're kind of down here got all<br>these things but there is a little bit<br>hazy so hopefully today we'll be giving<br>you some hints and hence in Terps about<br>how to if you know what your goal is<br>maybe some ideas about how to reach it<br>and if you don't know what your goal is<br>some ideas about how to figure out what<br>that goal might be and as Milton you may<br>have some major career changes so you<br>might have already got there once or<br>twice or three times but they've been<br>moving back down to the UM to the start<br>of the process again right so that's<br>enough talking already gonna make you<br>start okay so what I'd like you to do is<br>just this should be paper on the table<br>so paper pens and want you to think<br>about all the elements that make up a<br>perfect job for you it could be<br>absolutely anything it might be the<br>people you work with it might be the<br>location could be money the type of job<br>okay so we'll move on to the next thing<br>and we will come back to that list in a<br>little while so assuming your current<br>job isn't perfect<br>think about the obstacles what is<br>holding you back from achieving that<br>perfect job so write down some of the<br>obstacles yes they might be smaller they<br>might be large but there are things that<br>stop you from moving from your current<br>realities it says here to your desired<br>reality and it might be a mess of leap<br>lots of steps and say yeah so these<br>could be they could be C self-doubt fear<br>stress it might be feeling but<br>overwhelmed could be um could be that<br>your current job has pays well your<br>perfect job doesn't pay enough so how<br>are you going to overcome their<br>commitments mortgage kids you don't know<br>may not know what the right decision is<br>so it's sort of an to hard basket you<br>may not be aware of what the options are<br>and so therefore not willing to actually<br>make that next step and other obstacles<br>can be external obstacles so the economy<br>lack of support or other stuff that's<br>something else that could play into it<br>as life rolls so we all have multiple<br>life roles so you might be a homemaker<br>you might be a spouse you might be a<br>parent you've a worker you might have<br>voluntary responsibilities as well<br>sports so we've got all of these<br>different roles and we're trying to<br>juggle them all and so there might be<br>something going on there and some of it<br>just isn't in your control you've got no<br>choice<br>about it and as you'll see from this<br>those those some life roles can change a<br>great deal depending on what stage of<br>life you're in at some stages there<br>could be children that's who you have to<br>look after at home but other stages it<br>could be parents some elderly parents<br>that you might have to look after at<br>home so you might be a student there's<br>also something up there called leisure<br>right because we do want time for<br>leisure as well so you can think of that<br>as being a role too so we're not going<br>to do this tonight but at the end of the<br>PowerPoint there is a list of websites<br>and this is on there plus we've also got<br>it down the bottom so this is an example<br>of we love life and this is really<br>helpful when you're trying to decide if<br>there's something going on about<br>work-life balance so a lot of people<br>these days say they want work-life<br>balance but when they stop and look at<br>those roles that we were talking about<br>there might be something out of kilter<br>there and it's not just roles it's also<br>what's your priorities as well so a<br>priority and for this example is health<br>health is a priority for that person and<br>in terms of sort of the amount of<br>attention they're giving to that<br>dimension they've got close to team I<br>think it's probably an eight somewhere<br>around there in terms of being a sports<br>player they've got Tim their manager<br>might be about eight mother-father<br>they've given five partner probably<br>about a sex yeah so there is kind of<br>like a balance thing going on here team<br>member I think it might be a four end<br>colleague no team member might be three<br>and colleague right before so sometimes<br>having a look at that as well so if you<br>work-life balance is important to you<br>you could have a look at this if you go<br>on to that particular website they do<br>actually have a template that you can<br>print out and you could do it for<br>yourself and it'll be quite helpful to<br>do it twice once current reality the<br>other one what your ideal would be maybe<br>do the ideal first and then do the<br>current reality after that and that<br>might also give you a clue as to sort of<br>where things might not be quite right<br>and it could also help you to identify<br>some of those barriers so in terms of<br>what you want it might be that you want<br>a different job and you're quite clear<br>about that you might actually like the<br>organization that you're working in it<br>might just mean that you wanted a job in<br>that same organization just a different<br>job it could be that you want a<br>different way of working so you might<br>want not want 9 to 5 5 days a week it<br>might be that you want not to be an<br>employee but to be a contractor there's<br>lots of different dimensions it doesn't<br>okay you might be dissatisfied you want<br>some sort of change but you don't<br>necessarily need to leave where you are<br>if you're happy there if you like the<br>organization like the people you're<br>working with might be having a<br>conversation with someone at the<br>organization sometimes we know we want<br>to change but we don't have a clue what<br>sort of job we want or can do so<br>sometimes instead of actually agonizing<br>over what job what's my perfect job<br>think instead about the industry that<br>you want to work in so an example would<br>be a use accountant as an example<br>because we tend to have an idea or think<br>we do of what an accountant does how<br>many accountants are in the room ok so<br>I'm going to use accountant as an<br>example so just close your eyes relax<br>imagine you're an accountant at a<br>professional services firm so PwC or<br>KPMG or Jewish or somewhere like that<br>and just think about what that looks<br>like and what it feels like as well<br>okay so now you're an accountant and<br>you're working for Fisher and Paykel<br>healthcare same job different company<br>different industry think about how that<br>feels what it looks like what the people<br>you're working with are like now another<br>switch you're an accountant but you're<br>so do you sort of with each one of those<br>jobs it's exactly the same job but<br>probably the people you're working with<br>the work environment all of those things<br>have changed around you what you're<br>wearing will change as well so it's the<br>same job but the industry you're working<br>can have quite a profound effect so you<br>might be fine with the job but you need<br>to think about the industry if you don't<br>have a clue<br>think about the industry think about the<br>organization's you might like to work<br>for as well so instead of worrying about<br>the job come up with your top ten<br>organizations for whatever reason so<br>like I love to travel so on my list is<br>Auckland Airport and in New Zealand I<br>love the smell of jet fuel that weird<br>but as soon as I get to the airport I<br>start getting excited so those two<br>organizations are on my list what else<br>is on my list of the zone because I like<br>animals<br>ASB because I like the new funky<br>building down town but yeah what's on<br>your live ah University of Auckland used<br>to be on my list and now I'm here so<br>yeah for organisations it's not for me<br>it's not so much about the organization<br>it's the people within the organizations<br>and so that's that a whole culture fit<br>is really important for me so yeah we're<br>who I work for is less important than<br>the the culture of the organisation and<br>whether I feel I would fit into that<br>yeah so industry culture food all of<br>those things are really important so if<br>you really don't know what job think<br>about the industry and maybe come up<br>with a<br>stuff you know your top ten<br>organizations and it can be for quite<br>so this basically just sort of shows<br>that you might be when you're looking<br>for a job sometimes you're really lucky<br>you go to the right job right industry<br>straight away but other times you might<br>have to switch a little bit so you might<br>be in the right industry but wrong job<br>and then later you can switch so you can<br>get it right and it might take a couple<br>of steps<br>another option is going the other way<br>wrong industry but wrong right job so<br>it's just making that judgment call as I<br>see it some lucky people had it right<br>straightaway other people might have to<br>do a few satellites sideways steps to<br>keep into the right position it's been<br>quite strategic it's thinking about what<br>the right job and right industry is and<br>then coming up essentially with a<br>strategic plan in order to do it but<br>it's certainly well worth thinking about<br>those sorts of concepts yes I know<br>someone who was some had gone through<br>law school thought that they wanted to<br>be a corporate lawyer got him under<br>corporate law<br>and absolutely hated it came to me and<br>and and said to me I don't want to be a<br>lawyer anymore and I said is it not that<br>you don't want to be a lawyer or anymore<br>or is it the type of law that you're<br>practicing sir about six months later<br>she was in there feminine orpheum<br>absolutely loving it so so yeah so it's<br>it's sometimes it's just getting the<br>right niche for yourself and sometimes<br>it's also the work style so some people<br>love the sort of the nine-to-five five<br>days a week<br>full-time and type of job and it goes<br>back to that perfect job and it goes<br>back to those obstacles as well you<br>might have no choice about getting a<br>five day a week paid job where you're an<br>employee but you've got job security<br>maybe sorry here to it there but if<br>you've got a mortgage and if you've got<br>children and other people but sort of it<br>you're responsible for it might not be<br>so easy to sort of like say goodbye to<br>there and then be a contractor be<br>self-employed but there are lots of<br>different ways of working you've got the<br>pipe<br>employment the self-employment contract<br>work is becoming more common and then<br>we've got portfolio Korea which is a<br>combination of the above and that is<br>becoming a lot more common and so when<br>you talk to people they might say yes<br>I've got two jobs so two days a week I'm<br>doing contract work three days a week<br>I've got the security of paid employment<br>and for some people it's a choice other<br>people they've got no option they've<br>just been forced into it but it suits<br>some people to do the self employment<br>contract portfolio it just depends on<br>what's really important to you there's<br>also the whole multiple work sites so in<br>my previous job here at the university I<br>worked here in the city I worked up at<br>Grafton campus and I worked at Tomica<br>campus so three different work sites in<br>a laptop and a big bag hot-desking so<br>wherever I was I was hot desking so I<br>didn't have a set desk and the hot<br>desking thing is becoming more common as<br>well so going back to the anyone<br>familiar with the ASB building down on<br>when you'd quarter the inside what do<br>you think of the inside and the way it<br>sit up it's very colorful they do a hot<br>desk so basically if you're in a<br>particular area of the bank and you know<br>that sort of basic your color is green<br>you can set anywhere in the Green Zone<br>so it might be a couch it can be a<br>little igloo thing it could be a table<br>it can be a standing desk as long as<br>it's green you can sit anywhere and<br>you've got a cupboard with all your<br>stuff in it that sort of is becoming<br>more and more popular more and more<br>common with the whole sort of hot<br>desking open-plan offices telecommuting<br>remote working and then working from<br>home working from a cafe all of those<br>things you see people in cafes laptops<br>I'm one of those people sometimes but<br>when you're thinking about the work<br>staff think about what motivates you and<br>what what keys you along because if if<br>you get lonely really easily then<br>probably working from home might not be<br>the best<br>option for you so so you've got to think<br>of your your personal style and what<br>what you like is quite important and<br>that those sorts of considerations so<br>hot-desking if you're the sort of person<br>who likes to have personal things all<br>around you and you just make it your own<br>then hot-desking wouldn't suit you so it<br>is really important to get an idea of<br>what it is that you like okay okay so<br>we're going to go back to that initial<br>your ideal job so if you have a look at<br>what you wrote about your perfect job<br>they should be you should be able to<br>categorize the things that you've<br>written down in terms of these different<br>steps so this is the flower how many of<br>you have read Richards<br>bowls what color is your parachute Tim's<br>and we'll hold up the book if you ever<br>write a nonfiction book he basically<br>brings out a new book every single year<br>which is absolutely cool it's great idea<br>if you want to write nonfiction because<br>everyone feels like they have to have<br>the most recent one this one is 2006<br>2006 it still got a lot of value he just<br>tweaks it a little bit updates it so if<br>you want to buy one great you could get<br>it out of the library don't feel like<br>you have to get the most recent copy the<br>others will be just the 2006 is<br>absolutely fine don't tell him that I<br>think that and there's a lot of online<br>resources as well yeah and we've got the<br>website too the URL to his website on<br>the slides list as well so basically if<br>you have a look at what you've written<br>down it might be sort of something to do<br>with your values what's important to you<br>so that might be having a good manager<br>it might be having autonomy time freedom<br>those sorts of things or it might be<br>goals the sort of life that you want<br>something else you've written down might<br>be something to do with special<br>knowledge so you might have some<br>particular knowledge that you really do<br>want to use in a job<br>transferrable skills so things such as<br>people skills communication written or<br>verbal organizing and being this one is<br>people environments we have already<br>talked a little bit about they're the<br>people you worth are really a work where<br>they're really important we tend to want<br>to work with people who are like us and<br>if we don't we sort of feel a little bit<br>it's what's that book Venus Mars and<br>being older from Mars Women for visas<br>yeah it feels a little bit like that you<br>sort of wonder sometimes if you're the<br>alien the other thing is the working<br>condition so we've already talked a<br>little bit about that so their working<br>conditions working style and being<br>liberal a responsibility and salary<br>money comes into it you know if you've<br>got a mortgage and children to support<br>that is very different if you're totally<br>free in geography do you want to work<br>close to home do you want to work at<br>home do you have to move do you want a<br>government job and have to go to<br>Wellington so geography does come into<br>it as well so this is a really well<br>worthwhile exercise to do to do it<br>properly in terms of sort of like how<br>bowls sets it out<br>will take you a long time like a day or<br>two so this isn't that long a workshop<br>but hopefully just looking at what<br>you've written down you already can see<br>that you can classify some of these<br>things and sort of put them into the<br>right flower-petal<br>and just think that might take you a day<br>or two to go through this process but if<br>you are able to get that perfect job<br>else out of the self knowledge that the<br>springs then it's a day or two that's<br>well worth it one of the most important<br>things if I was to choose Tamsin and I<br>both are really sort of keen on the<br>whole values goals thing and it can be<br>very illuminating if you think about<br>sort of what's important to you think<br>about your current job for example which<br>is presumably you're not so happy with<br>think about it in relation to your<br>values does it meet my values always<br>sometimes<br>never and just could have categorize it<br>that way yeah definitely light bulb<br>moments with that and the skills so if<br>you think about skills think about<br>things that energize you so<br>unfortunately I'm good at Edmund but it<br>really does the amid asleep but I also I<br>really like organizing stuff I'm just<br>yeah that really gets me excited very<br>weird and I'm always thinking of ways to<br>sort of organize things even better so<br>think about sort of things that organize<br>you tasks skills basically one of the<br>reasons that we sort of hacking on a bit<br>about these two particular areas because<br>if you if you're doing something that<br>has against your values and you're doing<br>something where you don't feel that<br>you're actually utilizing all the skills<br>that you can offer then it's you're<br>going to feel dragged down by that and<br>and you actually least likely to succeed<br>and that role of the role that you're<br>doing whereas a few erm if you're really<br>lovely loving the values of the<br>organization and using the skills that<br>you really want to use then yes it's<br>frolicking into work every morning ready<br>to go it can make us such a difference<br>and the way that you encounter work<br>every day I love that word frolic I'm<br>gonna be watching you tomorrow to see<br>you but I like it okay so I wanted you<br>to think about your life so make it<br>focus on your future and your life plans<br>for the future and what you want to do<br>and are you going to make any changes<br>I'll give you a minute to think about<br>that one you could write some notes if<br>okay now think about your past<br>think about life-changing experiences it<br>could be something to do with people<br>having a baby getting married meeting<br>someone<br>it could be ideas it could be events<br>earthquakes to some sort of<br>life-changing experience think of a<br>couple<br>okay so I've got a question for you how<br>many of those did you actually play and<br>predict or control those life-changing<br>experiences any put your hand up if you<br>planned one of them two of them okay<br>three of them put your hand up if you<br>didn't plan any of them and yes there<br>are a few hands out there yeah there are<br>a few hands up sort of a lot of the<br>life-changing experiences we actually<br>can't plan for and so when I think about<br>it I've been made redundant<br>twice I didn't play him for those my<br>brother-in-law was made redundant and<br>that actually had an even bigger impact<br>on my life there are a lot of life<br>events that I just yeah definitely<br>playing or predict how about you - I<br>hear something disestablished three<br>times yes disestablish three times but<br>I've got jobs in the same organization<br>twice totally different jobs yes then<br>then I made myself redundant once so how<br>do you do that yeah how do you do it you<br>realize that the organization actually<br>can't afford you anymore<br>and so you go to your boss and say I<br>think you should I should make myself<br>redundant what do you reckon<br>and and then he said yes actually I've<br>been wanting to have this conversation<br>for a little while<br>but didn't know how to bring it up so<br>glad you did<br>intuition so and and yeah apart from the<br>one where I made myself redundant and I<br>had no control over any of the others<br>life it's a lot of us have life-changing<br>experiences it might be meeting someone<br>the next thing you know you're engaged<br>in you're married might be having a baby<br>it might be what else someone getting<br>transferred a lot of different things<br>that you just can't predict<br>but we're busy trying to play in our<br>lives in trying to sort of plan every<br>single moment of our lives and I've<br>already said that I like to organize<br>things so of course I like to organize<br>my life but yeah<br>so basically there's two types of<br>unpredictability the first one is my one<br>of my favorite word's your own deputy so<br>that's unexpected good things but the<br>other is disruption so that's the<br>unexpected bad things and it happens to<br>all of us it doesn't mean we shouldn't<br>plan but we should allow for the<br>unexpected so when it comes to the<br>actually I'll go to the disruption and<br>the unexpected bad things what we need<br>to do is that when it comes to there is<br>to basically make ourselves more<br>resilient so try and prepare as much as<br>we can so it might be building<br>relationships including professionals or<br>private and professional and might be<br>having some sort of nested behind us<br>it's building resilience it's being<br>prepared for the unexpected not-so-good<br>stuff it can almost be expecting the big<br>things will happen and so beyond<br>resilience as making yourself know it<br>knowing that actually you can cope will<br>help you to cope better when they<br>actually hit they they happen here yep<br>the more bad things happen the more you<br>know you can cope with them when it<br>comes to the unexpected good things so<br>in a sort of career context if we think<br>about sort of share your interests tell<br>other people what you're thinking about<br>what you enjoy doing and what you're<br>interested in what you might want to do<br>and perhaps just sort of extend the<br>indeed this is my favorite carrier<br>theory because planned happenstance it's<br>kind of a what some what's happened with<br>my life and career so planned heaven<br>stances is generating and recognizing<br>and incorporating those unplanned and<br>possibly chance events into your career<br>development so exploiting the these<br>these these things really and you talked<br>a bit about expending your networks well<br>the part of them that can um be chance<br>events like meeting someone and you can<br>expand your network some routes we're<br>doing something like that it's also<br>seeing seeing these unplanned events as<br>being somewhat inevitable and so<br>therefore make make perceive them as an<br>opportunity to learn and not something<br>to go yeah yes and also yet being<br>open-minded actually embracing the<br>thought that any day you might actually<br>meet your next boss any day you you<br>might talk to someone and they tell you<br>about the ideal job any day something<br>might happen with someone else that<br>actually gives you an opportunity and<br>that's going to help you to increase<br>your chances of being exposed to those<br>those things and why is this important<br>in the whole set of career planning<br>process what traditionally planing was<br>um was was really really important that<br>some there was a sort of a position that<br>things were under your control<br>Hicks um people started off life and<br>finished off life having been in the<br>same job and within the same<br>organization there was a sort of a push<br>towards a certainty in knowing what you<br>want to do and how you're going to get<br>there asking questions to be able to do<br>something so so<br>sort of information gathering and also<br>knowing your skills etc values etc will<br>guarantee a match with the the perfect<br>career but with plenty happenstance its<br>planning is just one element of career<br>development that the chance events play<br>a role in your career planning and so so<br>because they're keeping an eye out for<br>them being open-minded<br>embracing opportunities as they come and<br>and he says not being bound by a plan<br>and so so too close<br>you have the blinkers on asking<br>questions just to know something just to<br>gather information and and knowing that<br>your skills and values and interests are<br>in a very important element and and<br>having it success but also that career<br>in creating your own opportunities in a<br>career that it's going to suit you so<br>when I think about my career just go<br>back to that one hmm<br>chance events play a role when I think<br>about sort of how I've got my jobs I<br>actually haven't applied sort of seen a<br>job advertisement and applied there many<br>times a lot of it has been through<br>networking someone just casually<br>mentioning something so one job I got<br>was for two years I think it was just a<br>classmate asked me if I wanted to sort<br>of do some part-time work I think it was<br>supposed to be for two weeks and it<br>ended up two years and I had another job<br>like that it was for five years and I<br>was supposed to be for two weeks and I<br>thought yes I can you know I live out<br>east and I can go and work out west I'm<br>not a problem two weeks you know I can<br>do that<br>and five years later I was still doing<br>that journey but it was all the chance<br>of vient stuff Mel has already said that<br>she's had three career changes and she<br>said she was what 34 so I'm up to career<br>number seven or eight I've lost track<br>I've got at least one more to go I<br>hopefully that will be the last but yes<br>H and this isn't jobs so I won't tell<br>you how many jobs I've had this is<br>career<br>so a Charmin up in an HR career field<br>office administration lots of jobs<br>proofreader and sort of for most people<br>starting out these days that will be<br>quite common and you think sort of a<br>generation or two ago how unusual that<br>would be it's quite scary career<br>development no longer refers to upward<br>movement it's it can be vertical<br>it can actually be going downwards as<br>well some people make a choice to start<br>again and work their way up again or<br>just start again and stay where they are<br>go sideways or having of different phase<br>of life decide to actually know that<br>that was then and this is now and now I<br>want to do this what's going to suit me<br>now but the new technologies you've got<br>a globally diverse workforce you I was<br>already talking about open plan offices<br>and hot tea is talking the different<br>ways of working that's just going to<br>continue they say seventy percent of<br>today's job will disappear by the year<br>2050 it's 70 percent but if you just<br>think way back when last entry<br>cellphones so in the 80s they were the<br>size of a brick think about computers<br>and they were sort of like basically the<br>size of a room your cell phone can do<br>more than that computer could do and<br>think of all the sort of jobs that have<br>spun off from there so that will<br>continue this website just for fun have<br>a look at it you can just google careers<br>2030 and it comes up with lots of<br>different things but it has stuff in<br>there such as robot counselor it doesn't<br>count till the robots councils of the<br>people wanting to pictures a robot to<br>make sure you're comparable that's my<br>favorite the years re Wilder so farms<br>there's a vertical farmer so they think<br>farms are going to be sort of vertical<br>so basically the major and office<br>building but it's a farm so that means<br>all the countryside can be rewilding so<br>you dig up all the roads and plant more<br>and nature so that's a rewilding<br>there was another one I can't remember<br>the name of it but it's essentially okay<br>so you're in a retirement home and<br>you're nostalgic for I don't know the<br>1980s they basically will decorate your<br>retirement home your flat so it looks<br>like the 1980s that's gonna be good job<br>I think it's a nostalgia store something<br>just yeah<br>so all these careers they haven't been<br>invented yet some of them have a lot of<br>us will be more sort of seeking values<br>alignment will be more concerned about<br>the type of work we do and about the<br>organization and the values of the<br>organization will also be more worried<br>about the quality of life as well and<br>then a lot of us will be building skill<br>at skills and knowledge and that's the<br>sort of learning is a lifelong thing you<br>don't just go to university Lin and then<br>get a job and that's it you're<br>continually upscaling and learning and<br>being flexible he said if you think<br>those of you who identified yourself as<br>accountants how much change there is in<br>the accountancy profession and how much<br>change that there is predicted to be in<br>the accountancy profession and and then<br>just the next five to ten years and<br>thinking ahead how might you want to be<br>able to cope with that change so this<br>consideration of the future of workers<br>is really really important and sort of<br>getting yourself teed up for the future<br>and that's why the plant happenstance<br>the sort of their career theory the<br>traditional one certainly has its place<br>but something like planned happenstance<br>fits more and the sort of the future of<br>work idea so following apart career path<br>is a lifelong learning process so you<br>have to make lots of decisions and<br>respond to things that you didn't<br>predict essentially so the<br>self-assessment skill building being<br>flexible is key to actually surviving<br>then that sort of future world of work<br>with planned happenstance you don't have<br>to leave everything to chance it's not<br>saying there you do plan but you're just<br>have an eraser handy I love it as own<br>a lot of us are anxious about making a<br>career decision though so we could get<br>overwhelmed we can get paralyzed by<br>indecision you know what if I make the<br>wrong choice what's the right choice so<br>we worry about that there isn't a right<br>or a wrong choice there's just a path a<br>or path B and sometimes you might hop<br>between those two parts of it so I think<br>this was written and nineteen last<br>century nineteen ninety something so<br>that particular chapter starts on page<br>111 I talked about it quite a bit with<br>the students because it's a different<br>way of reframing I actually read this<br>book again just recently and it's<br>hilarious she talks about you know pen<br>and paper and computers didn't exist and<br>cellphones didn't exist and the whole<br>lot of other things didn't exist but the<br>message is still really good so just<br>think of it this way when you're worried<br>about right and wrong it's just a<br>different path and if you think of some<br>of the decisions you've made in the past<br>so go back to what we got you to do<br>about life altering events and think<br>okay if you had have made a different<br>decision there's be a different path and<br>the plan a a path a and path B don't<br>work then you can always perhaps find<br>path C I quite often talk to students<br>who really aren't sure what they want to<br>do so I'd get them to look at jobs they<br>might want in ten years time and I get<br>them to sort of like go through used to<br>be newspapers but online look at job ads<br>anything that attracts their attention<br>whatsoever they don't have the skills<br>they can't really do the job it just<br>sounds interesting there's something<br>about it that they really like then I<br>get them to have a look at the job<br>description and then figure out they're<br>here that job is there so how are you<br>going to get there so what skills do you<br>need to get to that job which is maybe<br>parfait so they figure out what skills<br>they need they figure out what other<br>sorts of jobs they need so they're doing<br>that and that's great but what happens<br>when they're doing that process and<br>suddenly they say oh that actually looks<br>really interesting as well<br>path a might be great but it might be<br>the<br>after a while they decide no that path<br>is perhaps better for me yeah so you<br>can't change your mind basically so it's<br>great to have a goal but not to be<br>totally blinkered and focused only in<br>that goal and miss all these other<br>wonderful opportunities so when I was<br>doing my master's thesis I was ringing<br>up employers and asking them about<br>whether they had an Employee Assistance<br>Program and I spoke to someone at in New<br>Zealand and he was really excited about<br>it<br>and he was talking about all year so you<br>know if you actually want any help and<br>if you wanted to sort of go and talk to<br>people sort of in the South Island we<br>might be able to help you citrate cetera<br>he was handing me you know this ideal<br>opportunity on a plate and I didn't even<br>see it<br>so it already just told you that any<br>Zealanders on my list because I loved<br>you and I love travelling and it's sort<br>of the way he was talking I should have<br>gone and spoken to him I could have<br>changed my study plans there was no<br>reason I couldn't but I decided I was<br>going on path a and now I'm still<br>kicking myself for not exploring that at<br>the path because who knows where it<br>might live to and so yeah just don't be<br>Glen kit okay so we've already sort of<br>slightly discussed these but but five<br>skills that that are that make plent<br>Evans dance work curiosity explore new<br>learning opportunities explore new<br>opportunities full stop persistence<br>don't do carry on trying you might meet<br>some setbacks but just just just<br>persevere and often you'll get overcome<br>those barriers and get to where you want<br>to go flexibility this is really really<br>important be open to changing attitudes<br>be open to changing situations and and<br>sort of cute your curiosity your<br>persistence and your in your flexibility<br>may make you actually actively listen<br>optimism one of those times that I was<br>made redundant was actually lead into my<br>role here as a career counselor because<br>when I was sitting there finding out<br>about how I could get another job and<br>doing what I was doing<br>I actually thought actually what I want<br>to do is what you're doing with me it<br>was someone who was helping me to<br>actually look forward to the future so<br>so be optimists it can actually see<br>opportunities that may and not a lot of<br>occurred to you and risk-taking I mean<br>here it was a bit of a risk to him to<br>completely change careers at that's at<br>that time I had a really good high paid<br>job but I saw this thing I thought yeah<br>I'm gonna go for that the funny thing<br>about all that is Tim's and I were at a<br>conference and she was on the other side<br>of the buffet table just talking to<br>someone about studying for a careers<br>qualification and so of course I<br>straightaway heard what she was saying<br>so we got chatting and then a job came<br>up here at the University contract so<br>then I asked him son if she wanted was<br>interested in doing it by hidden have<br>overheard that conversation so he<br>doesn't even know good old happenstance<br>yes<br>okay so just gonna sort of put all this<br>together using an example so you have a<br>friend and they're interested in writing<br>so what do you think they can do to<br>create opportunities so give you a<br>couple of minutes just to talk about it<br>at your table so your friend is<br>interesting and writing what can they do<br>okay so there's some excellent ideas<br>acting out there but you could come up<br>come back back together<br>if each table could just shout out to<br>the rest of the room one idea that they<br>identify an organization that they'd<br>like to work for yep two samples blog<br>okay what about you something that yep<br>something they're interested in and blog<br>about it<br>yep so blog is the bank talking to<br>people joining a club groups networking<br>yeah okay<br>so perhaps professional organizations<br>yeah yep yep so joining those and<br>gaining contacts through that right what<br>did your table come up with so<br>practicing okay so free service so<br>proofreading yep in this table being<br>persistent okay yep creative writing<br>so lots of practice yeah so the reason<br>we came up with this particular example<br>was to give you an idea of so if you<br>think about the obstacles that you had<br>written down so some of these examples<br>would help that person overcome the<br>obstacles we pretty much had the same as<br>what you've just said so creative<br>writing different websites so if you're<br>thinking say about changing jobs want to<br>know what to do in that particular job<br>there's a lot of websites out there that<br>you can have a look at so we've got the<br>careers New Zealand website so you can<br>just put in there a job title gives you<br>an idea of skills types of organizations<br>networking with writers attending<br>industry events so when I say writers<br>basically you could slot into that<br>whatever your ideal job or rollers<br>informational interviewing is really<br>powerful so you can get a lot of<br>information online but it's not the same<br>as talking to people and the actual job<br>so attending industry events networking<br>but if there's someone in a job that<br>you're really interested in even if you<br>don't know them you could actually<br>contact them and just ask them if they'd<br>mind if you brought them a coffee and<br>they could talk to you about their job<br>people do actually tend to like to talk<br>about what they do so informational<br>interviewing we're always telling the<br>students go out and do an informational<br>interview what else<br>volunteering you've mentioned there<br>these days it's so easy you can see it<br>up a blog as well have some sort of<br>column and professional associations<br>have a lot of information and for all of<br>you that mostly I would say be very<br>helpful and in terms of writing there's<br>a lot of contests they could do as well<br>you've got anything to add to that one<br>no I think that just about covers<br>everything and this group edits war as<br>well yeah so if you think of your<br>obstacles and might be you need to get<br>through the skill<br>that could be through doing the actual<br>job getting more practice it could be<br>through volunteering you might have to<br>do it for free it could be that you<br>don't actually know really what you want<br>to do but you might know the<br>organization you'd like to work for so<br>you could go and talk to someone there<br>do an informational interview or I think<br>it's Richard Bolles actually he's got an<br>example with someone they liked flowers<br>and they liked carpentry and they wanted<br>to do something to help people so he<br>suggested they work for a local was<br>other retirement village or something<br>like that and what he ended up doing was<br>making window boxes for people who lived<br>there and then teaching them how to<br>plant and garden so that person couldn't<br>figure it out themselves but I think it<br>was a doctor that helped them figure it<br>out so even if you go to someone tell<br>them what you're thinking about what<br>you're interested in what your skills<br>are they might be able to shine light on<br>it for you and that's the great thing<br>about informational interviewing too is<br>that you might shortcut a whole lot of<br>steps because this is the person that<br>what they can tell you is very rich and<br>information whereas some as we say<br>looking on a website it's all very well<br>but if you can actually ask the person<br>you know what what do you hate about<br>your job well what are the the pitfalls<br>what do you love about your job you can<br>get all those sorts of things and a<br>really crutch a short period of time so<br>essentially we've been talking a lot<br>about we've talked about plan to<br>happenstance we've talked about<br>traditional career planning up here is<br>that self assessment so you've got your<br>work style you've got the jobs and<br>industries the values so you need to<br>figure out sort of stuff about yourself<br>and that's often the thing we skip out<br>we just go straight here oh I want<br>another job I do my CV I apply for jobs<br>and that's oh but we need to start way<br>down here and then also the market place<br>what's happening in the market plays the<br>economy what sort of jobs are out there<br>what's going to happen and the few<br>so then we sort of come together with<br>some summary and some conclusions got<br>here option ABCD so after having been<br>made redundant I realized I didn't need<br>options so I'm always thinking about<br>what's next<br>unfortunately oh maybe so I have as I<br>said before I'm on to career number<br>seven or age I've got number one in the<br>works<br>I've actually got a strategic plan or<br>laid out for that one but I've got you<br>know if that doesn't work out what are<br>my other options I've got B and C as<br>well then you do the reality testing and<br>the researching so that's when you go to<br>talk to people and do the informational<br>interviewing and maybe go on to websites<br>then you make that career decision<br>always bearing in mind your other<br>options and then you do this part but<br>planned happenstance still does come<br>into it it's just about being more<br>self-aware thinking about interests<br>following them up following your<br>curiosity get involved in lots of<br>different activities because you just<br>don't know where they might lead looking<br>for opportunities to develop new skills<br>so not this job but the one before they<br>all wanted us besides being a Chris<br>consultant to do other things as well so<br>I had a look at sort of the list and I<br>thought yes you know marketing that<br>might be a useful skill for me to have<br>so always oops look for those sorts of<br>opportunities volunteer as well and just<br>once again that networking and<br>informational interviewing so said that<br>we had sort of a page with some links<br>for you so as I said the PowerPoint will<br>be seen out to you so these are just<br>some links wheel of life is that one for<br>the work-life balance that we showed you<br>Berkeley University so it is for<br>graduates for university students but<br>they have really good section on<br>informational interviewing on networking<br>on social media and then they've got a<br>whole section devoted to sort of that<br>self-assessment that I was talking about<br>so it is a great website prospects is an<br>English one and that is really useful if<br>you've got a say accounting you can look<br>up accounting see the types of jobs you<br>can get as an accountant just as an<br>example career view is the same it's<br>Victoria University so if you've got a<br>degree you're wondering what else you<br>could do with that major you could go on<br>to career view and just have a look<br>about five six pages of really good<br>information and it's New Zealand<br>information inside careers is very<br>similar<br>New Zealand careers it's more aimed<br>these days at students but it's still<br>very helpful and then we've got Richard<br>Bowles's website okay hmm<br>the the great thing about the New<br>Zealand careers will be precise it also<br>allows you to do some of that reality<br>checking you think oh I'd really like to<br>do that and you can go in there and find<br>out what the average salary is how many<br>people there there are in New Zealand<br>doing that particular role and what<br>their chances of getting a job and and<br>sometimes that can help you in that<br>career decision-making process if you<br>find out that there's some 200<br>economists in New Zealand and your<br>chances of getting a job as an economist<br>is really low then you might think okay<br>well there can be prepped one plane but<br>I might want to have a back-up plan for<br>that so so years it's a really useful<br>one that they're using Korea's website<br>yeah that pretty much finishes the<br>workshop unless you've got some<br>questions<br>yeah you will<br>anything else no hopefully that gave you<br>some insight and thank you very much for<br>coming</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
