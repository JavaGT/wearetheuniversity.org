font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>tell one of the things I mentioned that<br>you is that you've had a long history in<br>the dairy industry I think and if you go<br>back to your initial studies that was it<br>along those lines could you tell us a<br>little bit about your rise through the<br>dairy industry and what that journey has<br>been like yeah I can I can of course I'm<br>a Dutchman like like you might know born<br>in the Netherlands I thought I was gonna<br>wear a suitable titanite because we only<br>agreed ten minutes before we met here<br>that we were going to wear a tie so I<br>thought better way at that one and I saw<br>some good some good Heineken beer<br>already available here not yet for us<br>but maybe later so born in the<br>Netherlands really from quite a I must<br>say quite a poor background in the south<br>of the Netherlands my both my parents<br>lived pretty much through the Second<br>World War I'm the first born a child<br>left left-wing family labor labor<br>oriented so it was not much so so really<br>when I when I thought what am I going to<br>study<br>I thought food brands consumers that<br>that attracted me and the international<br>perspective so I started with food<br>technology of course with some<br>specializations into dairy and wanted to<br>study business straight after that but<br>there was no option again not a lot of<br>money so I just knocked on the door of<br>Friesland and I said can I be an<br>international management trainee and I<br>got allowed into the program and I said<br>but I would like to study business as<br>well if you allow me so first five years<br>as a trainee and did my Business Studies<br>into the MBI so then my food technology<br>and an MBA I went abroad for Friesland<br>because they wanted to capture some<br>value back of course I went to Indonesia<br>our first son got born there then went<br>to the Middle East second son got born<br>there went to Peru our daughter was born<br>there so back to the back to the Middle<br>East and back to the Netherlands to<br>Nigeria from Nigeria again back to the<br>Netherlands and after that I came here<br>so like I said all sorts of disciplines<br>I started off in production supply chain<br>then wider into seals seals went into<br>marketing commercial director up to<br>general management and in fact went<br>through the ranks in our 28 years almost<br>29 years in in the industry exciting and<br>a lot of changes from from milk is a<br>burden really in the European context at<br>that time milk is a burden or was a<br>burden with all the intervention and all<br>the all all the mountains of bottles and<br>powders too now milk is a blessing and I<br>said that when I came to the the<br>management team of recent foods or the<br>what we call it they had a Board of<br>Management I said first thing as it was<br>milk is not a it's not a burden guys<br>milk is a blessing because demand will<br>out outpace supply over time the<br>emerging markets will rise and people<br>need food need safe food so we better<br>start preparing a strategy which is<br>based on milk is a blessing and not a<br>burden and that's sounds simple but it's<br>very very it's a 180-degree turn so<br>sorry there's a long answer but now is<br>it was a great answer and you've been<br>all these places all over the world a<br>dutchman by birth of course Detroit<br>would have been a better place to grow<br>up<br>they have not done so well recently<br>right I hear the housing market has lots<br>of good so after all that journey all<br>those different places all the<br>opportunities it must be before you why<br>Fonterra of course Volterra was not<br>unknown to me so from Terra when I when<br>I worked for free sans was was number<br>one a very very reliable supplier like I<br>still remember when I lived in the<br>Middle East and in Africa I was always<br>very happy to see the purple whole milk<br>powder and the green skim milk pile of<br>eggs coming into our gates there was<br>always good sort of supply it's a really<br>a reliable supplier but they were of<br>course how competitors as well<br>mmm and how any joint venture partners<br>because in my free sometime we<br>established a joint venture with<br>Fonterra<br>and pharmaceutical lactose which is a<br>very very successful joint venture still<br>today so I knew them as a partner<br>supplier and as a competitor and so I<br>knew them pretty well but I I knew that<br>with the model of New Zealand at the<br>farming model that Fonterra was going to<br>be in that changed from a burden to a<br>blessing that Fonterra was going to be<br>the envy of the dairy world so that was<br>the ingoing position that when I when I<br>got the request to talk that I really<br>felt very positive but I mean if you<br>don't have chemistry around the board<br>table at that time if I don't feel<br>chemistry I don't do it whether it's a<br>big job for money or for status I'm not<br>driven by that there has to be chemistry<br>we were I said to the board at that time<br>let me do an outside in perspective and<br>there and then try to give a vision and<br>a strategy which I would drive and if if<br>there would be buying if there's buy and<br>then we're good to go<br>if there's no buy and then<br>we better don't go together and the<br>third criteria for me was really the<br>family if the family would have fallen<br>apart because our eldest at that time a<br>seventeen just came from secondary<br>school and the the second was 15 and<br>then 12 so if it would have fallen apart<br>then we would not have done it so it was<br>chemistry believe in the vision and<br>strategy and keep the family together<br>because for us it was kind of this was<br>still a time where we could move the<br>whole family and and so we did great<br>total role here one is it one is so<br>sometimes I guess not too often in this<br>room very good well we're glad he's<br>chosen the University of Auckland yeah<br>so you talked about it being a blessing<br>and that's a good choice of words that<br>clearly speaks to opportunities there<br>must be challenges so can you can you<br>talk about some of the challenges and<br>opportunities and in Fonterra strategic<br>context yeah enough i've chosen to bring<br>a few of our key slides with without<br>fundamental beliefs which makes it a bit<br>more clear we are always talking about<br>milk pools around the world if you look<br>at these circles the circles reflect the<br>milk milk pools and of course the green<br>the green part is what is consumed in<br>that bill pool and the blue part of the<br>circle is what is produced and then you<br>can clearly see that that in the sari in<br>the master look at this in this triangle<br>here from Middle East India China<br>Southeast Asia destroyed this triangle<br>you see that the demand outpaces supply<br>big time you know and these guys are<br>Europe with the quota system coming off<br>so they get the break off the rent they<br>had it on the red for the floor for 25<br>or more years they will become the<br>biggest milk pool and are able you see<br>that the blue is bigger than green so<br>they will start exporting we always say<br>we are the biggest but if you look at<br>this where we are we are the biggest<br>thing globally traded milk but globally<br>traded build is only 8% of<br>resumed only 8% so which we are always<br>saying we are the biggest and I tried to<br>say we're not the biggest we have three<br>percent three to four percent market<br>share of the global arena and yes the<br>blue circle is much bigger than the<br>green so we can export a lot right right<br>North America once it gets a little bit<br>simpler in North America with all rules<br>and regulations they will be an exporter<br>as well so you have three key exporters<br>to this Golden Triangle of demand right<br>right let them is so complex there will<br>be self-sufficient at best that there<br>won't be a net export or so these are<br>always our in going beliefs for<br>Australia we say what is going to happen<br>what is the trend line of supply and<br>demand and then of course we look at<br>other trends like ageing population<br>because this triangle the aging<br>population is going it's possibly the<br>biggest opportunity going forward we all<br>focus on infant nutrition on babies and<br>rightfully so because there's a lot of<br>value still there but the biggest trend<br>of five years from now in my opinion is<br>the aging population whether specific<br>nutritional needs and where we can<br>create a lot of value so it is affect<br>follow the trend lines starting with<br>supplying amount that follow the trend<br>lines on a constant basis - you have to<br>prioritize your strategy and to really<br>be clear to the organization what is our<br>focus for the next year two to three<br>years but also where are we going -<br>where do we want to be in five to ten<br>right and so in fact challenge is yes<br>but I call it more for for us it's more<br>opportunity because we have we have we<br>are the only ones in in in the world and<br>it's maybe good to say who can at this<br>moment can make good cash on commodities<br>we are able with our farming system and<br>with our skill to make cash on milk<br>commodities the Europeans can't the<br>americans can't without support in South<br>America counts so we are the only ones<br>to drive cash from commodity<br>and if you think about it that cash can<br>be used to go up the value curve and to<br>really drive the evident rich in the<br>advanced situations of baby food milk<br>products for aging population that kind<br>of things so keep the cash cycle intact<br>our commodity business which is a<br>beautiful business and I know that the<br>New Zealand context I might get<br>questions we are sometimes very negative<br>about it we should be very proud of it<br>because without our commodity business<br>we cannot do anything else and making<br>money on commodities starting from this<br>from this part of the world we started -<br>$150 per tonne logistic cost because we<br>are so far away and we're still able to<br>make money and nobody else is we should<br>be very proud of that yeah but we should<br>not be complacent we should not think<br>this is a beautiful cash machine so we<br>don't do any anything else we have to<br>drive more value for the country but we<br>can't be negative about about our<br>question already machine at peace about<br>the aging population I'm rapidly joining<br>that group my wife on the others are<br>among refuses to join that group and is<br>that an educational process because I as<br>you said I'm familiar with the infant<br>formula I think about that being a<br>market is that the doctors you have to<br>educate the populace or will that come<br>from somewhere else and you just have to<br>make sure the supply is there<br>I'm very much thinking about because if<br>it is doctors advise it you get a bit<br>into the medical arena and that could be<br>an opportunity but I prefer to stay away<br>because that's for pharmaceutical<br>companies and we we run a beautiful<br>device in Asia a bone scan where people<br>come into a supermarket put of the foot<br>in the bone scan and it's measured for<br>also pair of the trousers right so we<br>should think about cow innovation of<br>that skin it might be ended the same or<br>that we scan for muscles veins bones the<br>other that you do a whole scan based on<br>scanning a foot of somebody who gets<br>older<br>and gets an instant advise on you need<br>more protein or you need more calcium or<br>you need more both or you need that that<br>is kind of so when you see it when you<br>look at the coffee world yeah the coffee<br>world where we were milling beads 20<br>years ago putting it in a stupid filter<br>and put water on top of it and you look<br>where they are now with the machines and<br>the products that is a co innovation<br>which is which is fantastic right right<br>and I think that's the answer for aging<br>population that you have these scans<br>instant scans that you you're not sick<br>with you're healthy<br>you get a scan and you get an advice on<br>how to stay healthy right rather than<br>going to a doctor because most of the<br>time when you go to the doctor there's a<br>problem right it's reactive yeah yeah so<br>the scheme would be proactive would be<br>probably yeah so that kind of things we<br>should we should really think about<br>because in that in this part of the<br>world where demand is so high there will<br>be 400 million people more people over<br>65 years old by 2025 400 million I mean<br>a message right but you need to you need<br>to be proactive so I want to go back to<br>that comment about coming down Fonterra<br>because you knew they were going to be<br>the envy of the world<br>can you talk a little bit about that<br>journey how that what the progress has<br>been since you've been here and where<br>you see it going yeah I can and I have<br>I've put it for the board to relish here<br>as well and it's Sunday<br>sometimes on a piece of paper because<br>when especially a year ago when we were<br>in the middle of a crisis and we look<br>behind us and we didn't have a lot of<br>friends behind me anymore behind us but<br>then then you need to do a few things<br>you need to keep the business running<br>you need to you need to manage the<br>crisis but you also need to put an<br>ambition out you need to show the<br>organization what's the journey yeah<br>because people go in a crisis they go in<br>detail day to day minute by minute<br>micromanager and that's needed at that<br>time but you need to have<br>my perspective as well right so this is<br>the slide which which I kind of crafted<br>myself on the Sunday with what what what<br>what journey am i going through and what<br>journey do I take the coop through and<br>the farmers and the employees and<br>everybody so here you seated on the<br>left-hand side really a very proud New<br>Zealand co-op and sometimes the pride is<br>not showing but we should be very proud<br>with very strong values the very strong<br>story and and really really good that<br>Fonterra got formed because scale are<br>the New Zealand's so important right so<br>all the basics are good when I came in<br>we were talking about we were doing an<br>IPO called trading among farmers but we<br>did not have a clear value proposition a<br>clear strategy going forward so we had<br>to our government here<br>our farmers their financial where some<br>were there and it was all over the place<br>so we really be really fast tracked our<br>strategy called v3 volume value of<br>velocity with seven seven key strategic<br>pathways and now 55 roadmaps of<br>execution the being made example of last<br>week is one of the roadmaps and that's<br>shifting volume to higher value so be<br>proud of the commodity business but make<br>sure that the new milk is not ending up<br>as a comment as a commodity because we<br>have enough mm-hmm but ending up as a<br>value a product so that's what we call<br>strategy interaction was turning the<br>wheel we launched that in 13 and just<br>this year we launched our dishes from<br>tariff framework the whole holistic<br>proposition where the light blue piece<br>and I can quickly shift to this one is<br>our strategy so that's volume value<br>velocity really with our seven pathways<br>and 55 roadmaps but we also told the<br>organization we really said we have to<br>work on our identity so the whole crisis<br>from recall review recover and rebuild<br>that was going into this how do we build<br>our identity stronger and which what is<br>our focus because you can't do<br>everything<br>then it becomes chair it becomes charity<br>right so really focus on how to build<br>our identity and really how to build<br>that strong team one from there are not<br>fortress for dara and no arrogance<br>levels have to go down connection with<br>our stakeholders have to go up so that's<br>what we launched and sorry but really<br>the ambition which we put out there was<br>that globally relevant cow so the<br>journey from the proud New Zealand<br>called New Zealand to the world collect<br>a lot of white liquids make white powder<br>put it in a container and ship it and<br>make cash to a globally relevant curve<br>based on this wheel where it's not only<br>making money with your strategy but it's<br>also who are you what's the perception<br>around you out there<br>how do stakeholders think about you<br>right because that's part of your your<br>value proposition and how do you connect<br>your people to this to what you go for<br>strategy and what you stand for so the<br>turning the wheel piece and velocity are<br>those two and the same things are those<br>different concepts<br>now turn turning the wheel talks more<br>about volume of values so turning the<br>wheel is really is really meant to say<br>we should we want we really want to<br>shift more volume existing volume but<br>also new volume because every year the<br>milk pool grows by 3% so we want to<br>shift it to higher value so the wheel is<br>really about volume of value when you<br>talk about velocity then basically it's<br>two things it's really the the velocity<br>of your cash cycle that that we make<br>sure that our inventory turns as we call<br>it or we were at the inventory terms of<br>2.8 that I think a company per year but<br>a company like Frontera even though we<br>have that huge milk curve we should be<br>at four or five yeah so that's the<br>velocity of your business cash to cash<br>but it's also the velocity of execution<br>and velocity of execution the culture<br>was very much what I found<br>Bishu be hundred twenty percent sure<br>before you say yes to something and what<br>I'm trying to say is if we know where<br>we're going and<br>trust each other at 80% right push the<br>green button and we go and sometimes<br>we're wrong and then we just help each<br>other to correct but 80% right is<br>sufficient to go if you if that's in the<br>right direction and you trust your team<br>80% right go do the rest on the way and<br>if things go wrong sometimes things<br>things go wrong right but velocity of<br>execution is very important because if<br>you want to be a hundred twenty percent<br>right you find yourself always back of<br>the pack in a competitive field always<br>good as better than perfect yeah so so<br>that gets me up to the present day<br>what's the ambition for Fonterra we take<br>this enviable position what's what's the<br>next chapter yeah so so the ambition is<br>really what is the last part of normal<br>the last part but really what we want to<br>drive that globally relevant code and<br>the globally relevant code really again<br>this is some mind mapping not from a<br>consultant but really from ourselves and<br>from myself because you can say globally<br>relevant cope it's beautiful but what<br>does it really mean it doesn't mean the<br>largest exporter in the area<br>it doesn't mean exporting 2.8 million<br>tons over oceans close to container<br>doors here and you don't know where it's<br>going to end up and you don't know who<br>is going to consume it that's what it<br>does not mean yes that's our perception<br>right now the largest exporter so in my<br>mind we should become a co-op which<br>makes a difference in the lives of 2<br>billion people and that means it already<br>says that you want to form the exporter<br>which stops halfway that you really want<br>to connect to that consumer or customer<br>minimum much better but we preferably<br>the consumers of the customers right<br>yeah so you really want to have the<br>integrated model from Cairo to consumer<br>you want have more control of that so<br>what does that mean in terms of milk<br>pools we were present in let's say 2 or<br>3 no pools in a significant way we want<br>to be present in<br>4/6 that's why we are investing in<br>Europe we were not in Europe at all and<br>now through partnerships we have we have<br>said we were we are going to be in<br>Europe and we are already in collecting<br>or we are going to collect 2 billion<br>litres of milk direct and indirect right<br>so five or six mil pulls free in the<br>northern hemisphere<br>yes China Europe and North America and<br>three in the southern hemisphere that's<br>South America Australia and New Zealand<br>and not that's not a coincidence because<br>the seasons go opposite right or they<br>however they contradict so to be in the<br>northern hemisphere in the southern<br>hemisphere I think over time with milk<br>is a blessing it's very important so six<br>to five to six nipples then you see<br>turnover why turnover at this moment or<br>last year we were 22 billion litres of<br>milk 20 billion turnover so that's 0.9<br>per litre the world of there is at one<br>US dollar so is it one point to New<br>Zealand Dollars so if you like we are 25<br>or more percent behind the pack and<br>that's why we have to turn the wheel if<br>we don't shift volumes to higher value<br>we have to reach that one US dollar not<br>use Zealand dollar per litre and that<br>means one point to New Zealand dollar we<br>are now at 0.9 so that's a 30% increase<br>how do we do that we have to stay number<br>one ingredients so I'm not downplaying<br>ingredients I'm not downplaying this the<br>scale commodity business but we have to<br>do value add ingredients consumer brands<br>etc etc alright so but we have to<br>protect that number one in ingredients<br>because that generates this part<br>generates the cash to go into our key<br>consumer markets and we have selected<br>eight we are operating in 93 right now<br>we all rate them the same we have said<br>we select eight where we put 90% of our<br>resources right that means advertising<br>and promotion people research and<br>development for whole<br>so we have four markets only around the<br>world where we are leaders that's New<br>Zealand Malaysia<br>yeah that's Chile and Sri Lanka if you<br>add those four that's less than 100<br>million people so that doesn't really<br>bring you to the two billion ambition so<br>we have headed China we've added<br>Australia Brazil and we have added sorry<br>I was and Indonesia so if you have those<br>four edit yeah and we have we already<br>have good positions and we grow to a<br>number one or two then then you really<br>built the platform with these markets to<br>go to that ambition to the to build<br>billion people right and staying number<br>one in ingredients that's very important<br>and as for the wheel for me it's very<br>important that in these eight markets we<br>really are top three on the reputation<br>of leather so we have to work on<br>sustainability we have to work on<br>corporate social responsibility and we<br>have to work on our stakeholders because<br>that arrogant perception which is around<br>us that has to disappear and we can only<br>do that through world class people and<br>world class engagements right and I want<br>to come back to that point before I do<br>when you said the word control as a<br>strategy faculty member I immediately<br>think of vertical integration and<br>acquisitions but you're also doing a lot<br>of partnering is there is there a<br>preferred way to get more control over<br>cash to can count a consumer if that's<br>yeah but in some markets we can do that<br>easily out ourselves and even in some<br>markets like Australia we think we can<br>do that through consolidation but in<br>China China for us was five years ago<br>was five hundred million turnover now we<br>have five point five billion but five<br>point five billion in the context of<br>China being a sixty billion market is<br>still not that big so if you really want<br>to go to a number one or two position<br>you have to do it through partnerships<br>but these partners have to believe or<br>number one they have to be customers of<br>us of our beautiful powerful New<br>Zealand's ok<br>they have to believe in an integrated<br>model so the end-to-end and it needs to<br>be us and them<br>we need to complement each other right<br>and like what we announced last week<br>they need to be willing to share<br>knowledge and brands downstream and to<br>create more value towards the consumer<br>because so these are the three criteria<br>we use for partnerships and they they<br>apply all three so being mad is a good<br>is a good example right key customer<br>willing to develop upstream and willing<br>to share downstream okay and that's why<br>we did it and it's fast so we were on a<br>on a roll of going from 500 million to<br>5.5 billion but if you want to go even<br>faster then this partnership is going to<br>help so you talked about making a<br>difference in the lives of people in<br>there I think you were talking globally<br>and you talked about corporate social<br>responsibility and that could either be<br>in a domestic or a global context what<br>do you see as Fonterra's role in new<br>zealand with respect to social<br>responsibility with respect to making a<br>difference in people's lives<br>yeah and it's maybe back to this wheel<br>and that's my fundamental belief you<br>could also think about this wheel it's<br>it's it's profit its planet in its<br>people right is a bit along those lines<br>of course but you can perform and you<br>can drive the economy bring a lot of<br>cash home good revenue lines but if we<br>don't if we are not taking care of the<br>country and of the people in in the<br>country here in New Zealand so your<br>question was New Zealand's but in fact<br>it applies for all eight strategic<br>markets but when I when I had a<br>conversation with the board and I got<br>the message in June 2011<br>you will become our CEO I was full I<br>asked for Fonterra in the news every day<br>because I wanted to know what was going<br>on and and what you really read was<br>consumer price of milk so you don't feed<br>your children your cows are in the river<br>yeah and you don't share wealth<br>so with these perceptions and it was<br>more than perceptions part of it was<br>real<br>Israel yeah you don't feel to feed your<br>children your cows are in the river and<br>you don't share wealth you wear all the<br>light blue poverty you're going nowhere<br>you will hit the brick wall so we have<br>to that's why we say a responsible<br>daring means fencing the water-wise<br>planting the waterways and the Christian<br>for all means what we have rolled out<br>170,000 children in New Zealand have our<br>milk every day just 27% of New Zealand<br>children at that time did not have one<br>milk serving before noon it's just<br>unacceptable you cannot be the largest<br>exporter in the area and and and trying<br>to make money on this side globally<br>right and you don't take care of the key<br>issues in the nation but that's<br>impossible because you're going nowhere<br>in the end you're going nowhere so and<br>that's for me so sustainability and<br>corporate social responsibility is not<br>charity for me it has to support light<br>blue and dark blue have to go hand in<br>hand<br>yeah because nutrition is very very<br>important for our business as well right<br>responsible dairying if you talk about<br>the integrated chain is is crucial right<br>so you have to choose this topics way<br>where you make a difference and I think<br>we did globally relevant co-op if you<br>really go to 2 billion people there's<br>still 4 billion people in the world who<br>live below $2 a day right and we ship or<br>we reach<br>at the moment 1.5 billion people direct<br>and indirect but we don't use our milk<br>powder our commodities to fortify and<br>the key deficiencies in the world are<br>still vitamin A iron iodine zinc so my<br>belief here is if you want to be<br>globally relevant<br>why not fortify and it's not so easy<br>because putting iron and milk gives a<br>gray color and all that kind of stuff so<br>but find solutions to really address<br>issues in the world and I don't think is<br>that is that complicated but but that's<br>what I mean with blogaid relevant so and<br>that means that's a part of<br>sustainability and corporate social<br>responsibility as well that you've seen<br>with the World Health Organization and<br>UNICEF to to make a difference with the<br>30 billion litres of milk and protein<br>good well we've talked a lot about<br>Fonterra I'd like to bring it down to<br>the individual level for just a minute<br>you found all these varied experiences<br>varied cultures different parts of the<br>business affected a large merger and<br>acquisition moved to a different company<br>as CEO can you reflect back and distill<br>some leadership lessons if my MBAs asked<br>me next week what did tails have to say<br>about yeah that I can put to practice<br>from a leadership perspective my lessons<br>by less is the effect do not believe it<br>or not but do not come straight from a<br>can we write one together yeah we could<br>now that I think for for myself it's<br>it's really and and you do these things<br>when you're at the crossroads where you<br>just come out of a bird in Europe and<br>you decide to go your wrong way then you<br>reflect on what you've done and then you<br>look at your own values first and<br>foremost and and for me and that's that<br>so that's what I try to do in leadership<br>as well clarity is crucial if an clarity<br>can mean I mean positive stuff but it<br>can also mean you can be very clear but<br>it can mean it might mean negative as<br>well or negative message right for<br>people but if you know if you are clear<br>in the organization of where you're<br>going and what you're going to do and<br>what you're not going to do and what<br>you're going to tolerate and what you're<br>not going to talk to tolerate that's the<br>first and foremost where are we going<br>what's the clarity for myself but also<br>for the organization second for me is<br>the respect order that's the other side<br>of the arrogance part where we have we<br>are perceived to be a arrogant we have<br>to gain respect around the world then<br>you have to work in multiple cultures<br>and you know possibly how difficult it<br>is because if you work in Africa and<br>South America<br>if you don't show intrinsic respect as a<br>human being for their culture you're<br>going nowhere right so you have to be<br>clear that can be black and white<br>sometimes but you have to respect people<br>and and and cultures and then you have<br>to build a team with velocity and 80%<br>right and successes and have fun as well<br>and that's that that's really three<br>three dimensions which are which are<br>very important for myself and how I look<br>at the organization every day but when<br>you talk to your students I think the<br>clarity piece is very the focus on what<br>they want to what they want to achieve<br>right that's number one number two for<br>the students is never stop learning and<br>learning doesn't mean<br>books but learning means shift from<br>production jobs to to supply chain to<br>commercial take risks right that's<br>that's really very important and and a<br>key lesson and I've seen that in and<br>relevant I see that in the organization<br>people who go through the ranks and and<br>I brought up in a kind of we are number<br>one we are the biggest they they they<br>they go onto an behavior which is taught<br>to them right so they move away from who<br>they are so you have to stay authentic<br>you have to stay close to your own<br>values and so you need to focus you need<br>to be able to learn all the time and<br>keep on learning but you have to stay<br>close to yourself and people going<br>through the ranks lose themselves a lot<br>of people lose themselves and I dare to<br>say born of 50% of people going through<br>the ranks lose themselves or move away<br>from who they really are as a person so<br>they haven't adopted managerial behavior<br>based on politics and based on processes<br>and based on I don't know what okay that<br>that's try to stay as close as possible<br>to who you really are and if you're if<br>if who you are does not match anymore<br>with the company you should leave maybe<br>or you should look for them for another<br>opportunity so you're a brand of sorts<br>and your brand either fits in the<br>portfolio or it does it does yeah but<br>don't move away from yourself but be<br>focused what you want to achieve or<br>whatever way where you want to go right<br>for sure I stay eager to learn and the<br>bit about clarity<br>I understand how it's easy or maybe not<br>easy but easier to get clear for<br>yourself and maybe to really roll that<br>message out to your immediate management<br>team but how do you roll it down all the<br>different levels across all the<br>different locations it starts at the top<br>I thought I believe and and what when we<br>launched this is from Tara and we really<br>spoke around our our values and what<br>behaviors we really said our four values<br>means this is<br>behavior we want to see and we did the<br>kind of very quick 360 around the<br>organization for people do you do you<br>lift the values or are you not living<br>the values including myself and we had<br>an international management forum in<br>China and I just put my score on how I<br>rank myself and where I'm good and where<br>I need to improve up on these two big<br>screens you just talk about it and if<br>and if the top that does that and is<br>open about it the organization will<br>following it was very fast okay well<br>you've had to endure my questions for<br>about 40 minutes now I think it's time<br>to give the audience a chance to ask<br>questions so let me answer that in two<br>or in two blocks the first the political<br>block I'm not a politician and I'm not<br>gonna make stage statements around that<br>but I do know and I have seen in in<br>Europe as well that campaigning is<br>something different different than being<br>in charge right so you can campaign<br>campaign something but if you're in<br>charge the economy has to continue as<br>well so I'm not gonna say more more<br>rounded and but you're absolutely right<br>I mean if there's political changes and<br>and we would not have acted or started<br>to act 2 2 years ago or it's now 18<br>months ago our farmers have fenced<br>twenty three and a half thousand<br>kilometers that's from here to London in<br>in in 15 to 18 months fenced waterways<br>so if we are not working on that you<br>will get a massive at a certain point in<br>time you will get you will get a massive<br>bill right because if you don't solve<br>the problems and and if you don't make<br>if you're not sure that you do<br>sustainable farming yet and you continue<br>the way we possibly did it 10 years ago<br>the end of the story will be legislation<br>penalties court cases Texas carbon taxes<br>it's all the wrong things<br>right because all that money goes into a<br>pot and then possibly routes are being<br>built and the emissions still continues<br>but so so we have to we as business we<br>have to make sure that we prevent these<br>things and you you've heard me possibly<br>saying that we are ten years late and I<br>mean that really and I'm not saying the<br>farmers people think that I'm saying the<br>farmers I'm not we as such with such a<br>big company in two thousand three and<br>four we were writing a sustainability<br>strategy in Europe in the Netherlands<br>for our customers have for all our<br>stakeholders because three million cow<br>scenes on the size of a Waikato with<br>sixteen million people in a country<br>which is 2/3 below the water we look<br>below the sea is not easy right so you<br>better make sure that you have a<br>sustainability plan and that you execute<br>and same here so people should not tell<br>me it's not possible in in in New<br>Zealand it is possible right but you're<br>absolutely right if if you don't do it<br>you will get a massive bill and that<br>money does not necessarily end up in the<br>right place your question is very well I<br>I think if you're if you're brought up<br>in in consumer goods yeah or if you're<br>brought up in service industry or maybe<br>I'm not saying it rightly robbed but you<br>know what I mean that that is<br>significantly different right but if you<br>brought up in consumer goods could I<br>shift to a Phillips or to a Unilever or<br>to I think again<br>yeah and should I have done that I<br>didn't I didn't opt for that because I<br>had the functional shifts in in my<br>career and I had the the huge<br>differences or I opted for functional<br>and geographies so I've worked in five<br>five continents around the world and<br>that was my my choice and I could tell<br>you my learnings in Nigeria was slightly<br>different from<br>my learnings in Indonesia yeah so but it<br>is it is a choice but but if you ask me<br>whether with with my background and CV<br>whether I could potentially shift to a<br>GE or let's say branded a branded<br>consumer products company not food I<br>think I think you can because you talk<br>about you talk about the same diner or<br>same dynamics with different companies<br>but this same DNA if you ask me could<br>you shoot you shift to run a bank I<br>would have to think a few nights or<br>about that coming back to you to your<br>question stupid two questions ago but<br>but I think maybe the question what what<br>what I've really in the New Zealand<br>context what I've what struck me most<br>was the the the magnitude and the<br>importance of from Tara for for the<br>country and you read about it you know<br>far away and I knew about it when I was<br>with another co-operative but but you<br>can only yeah you can only really do it<br>or you can only talk about it if you<br>have experiences so that that's really<br>there and there's not one country or<br>business in the country which has a<br>ratio like Fonterra has and that's why<br>we should not and Ralph agrees with me<br>unab sense that we should not talk about<br>with the biggest of New Zealand's we're<br>the biggest of this now we only have<br>three to four percent market share in<br>that world and we better make sure that<br>it becomes five or six yeah and and if<br>we drop that arrogance and<br>and talking at people rather than<br>talking with people right mmm that's a<br>very good question and if you if you<br>look at the demographics and you project<br>nine billion people relatively soon and<br>you look at income levels and you look<br>at at urbanization trends and all that<br>and you think around those mill pools<br>and can we feed all those people in a<br>safe way that's the first for me the<br>first question in a safe way the way we<br>have been doing it in the past the<br>answer is potentially no we need to<br>think of different different routes to<br>markets we might I know that genetic or<br>genetically modified is a big thing and<br>a big theme around the world and nobody<br>dares to talk about it but we need to<br>start talking about it and we need to<br>start putting to put science behind it<br>that is not something bad and evil but<br>it is something which is possibly needed<br>over time and maybe it's called<br>different at that time with different<br>science but if we if we don't think<br>different we're not going to be able to<br>feed nine billion people and we're<br>definitely not going to be able to feed<br>them safely so we need to collect or the<br>lactose intolerance thing is is again a<br>different example I mean if your special<br>needs if people have special needs like<br>the aging guys and then then then then<br>you modify and you innovate right same<br>for lactose intolerance but that's a<br>bigger question for me is how we're<br>going to feed people and how are we<br>going to feed them safely and we need to<br>not shy away from certain topics and and<br>that's the same for soy good soy become<br>part of the protein base for for milk<br>products I think it's good we are one<br>one we have milk schools of course at<br>some 70,000 children and then<br>the government we run together with<br>government on a 50/50 base the kickstart<br>breakfast for really the poor children<br>who who have really strong nutritional<br>needs so they're both yes we can do more<br>but I mean I'm looking at eight<br>strategic markets at the school at the<br>two billion ambition and and I think<br>next to New Zealand we need to do if we<br>say Sri Lanka and if we say Indonesia<br>then we need to we need to think<br>nutrition we need to think how to help<br>the farmers to really farm sustainable<br>we have to think about water because<br>water is a big problem in those<br>countries it's not input into farms but<br>it's input into the milk products yeah<br>because powder with water becomes milk<br>and if it's good part of a bad water<br>still a bad product so we yes we can do<br>more but we need to balance we need to<br>we need to balance our activities around<br>the world really the the New Zealand<br>brand and then I mean the clean and<br>green country I'm not talking about<br>hang-ups and pure tech lines and that<br>kind of stuff because we have to<br>distinguish right so brand new zealand<br>for us is or is a blessing clean and<br>green and the the pasture the the Halep<br>said pasteurized milk farming delivers<br>is significantly different tastes in our<br>production butter so it's not quality<br>people say quality right quality is a<br>you have to really comply but it's not<br>differentiate but our our 12 months<br>passed by its farming leads to a<br>different testing butter<br>a different tests in in in creams<br>different tastes in notepads people can<br>distinguish even to the extent that<br>where the milk comes from the North or<br>the South Island<br>climate wise and so we have a distinct<br>product taste and that and that demand<br>sometimes a premium yeah but if you talk<br>brand new zealand from with the tech<br>line i think the country should do much<br>more and we should help the country<br>really to drive that yeah because the<br>live the fern or whatever we're going to<br>use but the fern is so strong look at<br>the airline the fern should really be a<br>seal of quality or seal of guarantee for<br>for for the best food producers in New<br>Zealand but that's a different<br>discussion right so you have two<br>discussions clean and green and taste<br>preference and you have that seal that<br>which is called brand new zealand but<br>it's not loaded at this point in time<br>and and it's not used sufficiently by by<br>the key players from New Zealand in my<br>opinion yeah the the seal of farm<br>farmland to foreign investors mm-hmm<br>again block one I'm not a politician<br>yeah block block two if there's rules<br>there's rules in a country and if a<br>never a guy with a with an orange tie<br>coming from Holland Kemble and then then<br>a Chinese should be able to buy land and<br>if any like a China we cannot buy land<br>but the Chinese people cannot buy land<br>not one square meter of China's owned by<br>a Chinese it's owned by the government<br>so rules are rules you can't<br>discriminate does it answer your<br>question and I know that I have to made<br>that's that's why with coat I the<br>company we have we are formed we are<br>really talking about it's 11 ports for<br>New Zealand is that the most efficient<br>thing to do or not you know or should<br>should we have less ports deeper water<br>wise bigger ships because 3,000<br>containers on a ship is nothing out of<br>Europe ships of 22 to 20 mm and I'm not<br>saying that that should happen here but<br>scaling up to 8,000 or to 10 will help<br>so in that sense we if we if we opt to<br>to to not go forward then we lose<br>resilience pretty fast because again<br>like Europe to China they get free free<br>shipment because China exports and<br>otherwise it would come back empty so<br>they they almost ship powder for free<br>from Europe to to China and that's what<br>we have to work against so we have to<br>get the 8,000 container ships at a<br>certain point in time not co-op first of<br>all has as huge advantages right because<br>think about and and that's why we're<br>talking in these five or six mil pools<br>we have to be able to connect farmers of<br>borders because connection with farmers<br>means a security of supply number one<br>but it also means that you that you<br>really have a strong relationship with<br>your shareholder the shareholders not<br>unknown right you have a strong<br>relationship you know who they are and<br>you know where to reach them and how to<br>talk to them right and yes I know that<br>there were a lot of opinions and what<br>farmers would want or would not want in<br>New Zealand and I have heard many times<br>that farmers would be resisting certain<br>progress where as milk for schools which<br>is not a cheap initiatives or whether it<br>is going offshore<br>and investing money but so far with our<br>strategic approach and with the journey<br>in the pathway and why we do it<br>I mean farmers are people who are<br>genuine that we're talking about or the<br>authenticity part they are Hana percent<br>authentic so they say when they like it<br>that they say when they don't like it<br>but if you if you give them clear<br>reasons to believe why this is going to<br>create value for them they will buy it<br>and even more than that they were<br>supported there will be investors and<br>and I don't I have not seen much of<br>resistance and against what we're doing<br>from the farm base of course the<br>fluctuation of the mill price like what<br>happened last night again the volatility<br>nobody likes that right but I have only<br>felt support from our farmers and when I<br>just I was joking about the year ago<br>when the crisis hit us hard<br>in fact when I looked behind there was<br>only one group there in the were the<br>farmers yeah in in consumer goods if you<br>don't have a branded proposition you can<br>innovate what you like but you're never<br>going to create significantly more value<br>right so you have to first select your<br>key brands we used to have 60 brands<br>active and supported<br>we're going back to five so five key<br>brands in eight key markets and that's<br>where 90% of all resources are going to<br>go then you have to you have to load<br>these brands with brand or brand equity<br>but you have to give reasons to believe<br>and that's what we call benefit<br>platforms so we have selected five of<br>those been a benefit platform for baby<br>food is its cognition yeah for aging<br>population it's it's really<br>and the knowledge we have on bone health<br>we can widen that when we were talking<br>about everyday nutrition we talked about<br>taste texture and so we've we have<br>really defined five benefit platforms<br>for our brands which we load with about<br>45 different projects we used to have in<br>Palmerston North with 400 people in<br>research and development<br>more than 180 projects we're going back<br>to only 25% loading five platforms and<br>five brands but we might spend more but<br>if it's not if if it's not connected<br>innovation your your question is<br>innovation not research because<br>innovation for me is pull from the<br>brands in the consumer and research<br>could be push right and and for me<br>innovation is about 70% of your spend<br>and research is about 30% of your spend<br>but it has to be focused it has to be<br>focused on on areas where you can win<br>with your brands and you have strong<br>reasons to believe and you have to look<br>at your your strengths and we can think<br>about going completely out of the box<br>and going to invent all sorts of new<br>things on prebiotics and probiotics<br>which we did before as well and we find<br>hand on with with with people who are<br>much better at at that theme digestion<br>and gut health<br>there's players who are much stronger<br>than us so don't go there<br>yeah take your strengths take take this<br>taste advantage textures Vantage take a<br>cognition take bone health and and get<br>now we'll we'll build white around e<br>there are only or two dater outside of<br>the Western world but in the emerging<br>markets there's there's there's only<br>three markets where we're soy is really<br>competing with milk and it's Thailand<br>and this Vietnam the day they they are<br>the top two right so debts where does<br>competition and in all the other<br>emerging markets is going to be<br>complementary and as per the previous<br>question feeding nine billion people in<br>in big cities requires a combination of<br>the two and I think that their players<br>and if we would opt to have up to 25% of<br>the protein in milk servings soy based<br>over time to address that key issue in<br>the world should not be it should not be<br>a problem the problem starts when it is<br>eighty to a hundred percent because then<br>it doesn't it doesn't help our farmers<br>it doesn't help our shareholders if we<br>if we replace milk protein to soy one<br>percent and then then we undermine the<br>coop right but going hand-in-hand at a<br>good balanced percentage should not be<br>an issue so tell we can keep you here<br>all night with questions but I really<br>appreciate the Straight Talk and as a<br>new kid in town the opportunity to have<br>this conversation thank you with you I'm</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
