current affairs journalist Barry Soper on his role at the heart of a presidential election campaign.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello ladies and gentlemen my name's<br>Barry Soper politics has been my<br>business for more than thirty years John<br>Keyes the eighth prime minister that<br>I've traipsed around the world after<br>last week was no exception in South<br>America currently the political editor<br>for News talks he'd be and for Sky<br>Television and in that capacity I in<br>fact covered the dying stages of the<br>presidential race and of course and Mitt<br>Romney's case it literally was the dying<br>stages which we'll be talking about<br>tonight a bit it is wonderful to be in<br>this Fisher and Paykel auditorium<br>although our iconic company now belongs<br>to the Chinese so I guess we should be<br>thanking them tonight for this as well<br>and the Owen Glenn building I do<br>remember when it was opened Helen Clark<br>Trevor Mallard trying to keep her away<br>from Owen Glenn for the traditional<br>photograph and that had a lot to do with<br>politics we're going to be discussing<br>tonight the reflections on a<br>presidential campaign<br>and what's more from a New Zealand<br>perspective Chris Liddell's and honors<br>engineering graduate from this<br>University and is arguably one of the<br>country's most successful experiment<br>although it was pretty successful when<br>he was here in New Zealand as well he<br>was the former head of course of Carter<br>Holt Harvey international paper is the<br>CFO of as he was of Microsoft and<br>General Motors but it's in his role as<br>executive director of the MIT Romney<br>transitional planning team that is the<br>key to tonight's discussion I think even<br>he might admit that he's not the best<br>known businessman in this country so I<br>thought we'd delve into what basically<br>is driven him in his life which included<br>going to Oxford University to complete a<br>master of philosophy degree which no<br>doubt equipped<br>well for his later foray into politics<br>so Chris without further ado you grew up<br>in Auckland an engineering degree is not<br>something that you would usually<br>associate with business so what got you<br>interested in business I think<br>engineering is a great discipline for<br>ready for anything<br>it's a and it comes to education<br>generally I mean education and a degree<br>is training the mind as much as training<br>you at a skill so you know what do I<br>remember of engineering virtually<br>nothing what a most even engineers of my<br>age who are still in the engineering<br>remember of engineer virtually nothing<br>so it's really a training of the mind so<br>engineering was fantastic for me because<br>it gave me a skill base really around to<br>the project management and in fact I was<br>relevant to the Romney situation because<br>what I was doing was a big project<br>management skill but engineering was<br>great I was good at I was good at maths<br>and physics so it was a logical thing<br>for me to gravitate into and it really<br>taught me skills around logical thinking<br>practical project management getting<br>stuff done simplifying things delivering<br>on results etc etc and that to be honest<br>has been incredibly useful in everything<br>that I've done there afterwards and I<br>was as lucky as you mentioned that I you<br>know I went on an into the literary<br>degree so I I had the training both on<br>the logical side through engineering but<br>then I also complemented that<br>fortunately in my case with a literary<br>degree which was much more about<br>conceptual thinking so again that gave<br>me some skills that I you know went on<br>to have I taught or we used philosophy<br>in any great way No<br>but did it teach me to think in a<br>certain way that's been applicable to<br>all sorts of jobs and roles absolutely<br>do you think it's given you maybe a bit<br>of a soft reach no I think the people<br>who work with me would say softer edge<br>it's not one of my main skills it's<br>taught me to think about things in a<br>hope you curious and<br>is nobly conceptual way and you know<br>that that really has probably been you<br>know the basic underpinning of<br>everything I've done I've read that when<br>you interview people for jobs which<br>you've done on many occasions that you<br>ask them to sum up their lives in three<br>words and you know what's going to carp<br>me out what are the three words that<br>that's a good question because it<br>changes over life and that's the reason<br>why I do if I can answer that and then<br>I'll talk about myself is I'm looking<br>for a few things what I'm looking for<br>people to but the ability to do that<br>because normally if you can't convince<br>complex things into simple in this case<br>three words at January shows you've got<br>a cluttered mind and most of the things<br>I'm doing don't allow themselves to have<br>quite of minds so people who are able to<br>take a concept and make it very Crescent<br>as important so it's one of the reasons<br>I do it and then I'm looking for<br>keywords depending on the role in terms<br>of me it's changed a lot actually but I<br>would say at the moment I'm balanced I'm<br>much more balanced than I've ever been<br>in my life that age probably yeah and<br>age in stage and having done a lot of<br>interesting things keep putting that in<br>perspective so and I wouldn't have used<br>balanced probably any other time in my<br>life I'm curious I'm probably more<br>interested about what's going on around<br>me and what's going on in the world that<br>I've ever been and positive optimistic<br>one of those to just feel good about<br>life in general<br>you thought back to when you're a young<br>man here growing up in Auckland did you<br>ever envision that the internet<br>international stage was going to be your<br>catwalk I always wanted to do something<br>that was significant internationally<br>yeah<br>I guess if you'd asked me when I was 15<br>years old I wanted to be an all-black<br>but yeah my parents probably had a lot<br>of amusement looking at that because as<br>you can see I wasn't built for that<br>particular role but I always had an<br>aspiration to do something global<br>I would have had no conception of no<br>ability whatsoever they actually<br>articulate what that was and the things<br>that I've done yeah are you know I could<br>never afford him there even 20 20 years<br>ago to be honest but alone 40 but you<br>know I always had some goal to do<br>something really interesting in<br>aspiration one thing you did do of<br>course was the almost right at the top<br>of Microsoft I think some people here<br>may be interesting what Bill Gates was<br>like yeah Bill's a fascinating guy he<br>would be definitely one of the other you<br>know I play lots of games and one of the<br>other games is you know who would you<br>have around a table if you can choose<br>five either living or dead people from<br>history who would you have around a<br>table bill would be one of mine even<br>though I've you know I've spent a lot of<br>time with him he's one of the most<br>fascinating people and I think probably<br>one of the most iconic people of our<br>lifetime not just from business but<br>generally because what he's doing in<br>philanthropy how would I describe Bill<br>smart just probably the most most<br>intelligent smart guy I've ever met but<br>not in a in a narrow technology sense<br>which is what he's most known for in a<br>very very bored sense he'd be the most<br>well-read person I know in my life<br>going into his library at his houses you<br>know better than going into most<br>libraries in the world from history<br>politics arts everything he he would be<br>the most well-read and most articulate<br>person on virtually any topic I didn't<br>think of okay from Microsoft we're not<br>too General Motors and as we know<br>President Obama bailed the company up in<br>2008 and it was two years before you I<br>think became the chief financial officer<br>there but you will have been aware that<br>Mitt Romney said let Detroit go bankrupt<br>arguing that the best way to help the<br>save the auto industry was through a<br>structured bankruptcy do you think he<br>was right yeah and of course it did go<br>bankrupt and that's one of the ironic<br>things you know General Motors did go<br>bankrupt and and and the the I doubt<br>still occur the Paylor occurred and<br>whether the government should have been<br>the end<br>that that did it or not is really the<br>question and should they don't have done<br>it in the way they did I companies go<br>through bankruptcy all the time in the<br>u.s. is just part of the way in which<br>they run businesses to allow bankruptcy<br>so that from the ashes grows the company<br>with General Motors have disappeared if<br>it had gone through a probe bankruptcy<br>no no it still would have produced cars<br>it would still would have come up from<br>the ashes and been the company of laws<br>whether the government should have been<br>involved and effectively created the<br>subsidy for the unions and the way that<br>they did it I argue not the taxpayers<br>will lose somewhere between ten and<br>twenty billion dollars so should have<br>have gone through bankruptcy absolutely<br>should the government have got involved<br>probably it wasn't necessary given the<br>time but the way in which they did it I<br>don't think was the best way of course<br>that leads us all to Mitt Romney you I<br>guess it was sort of looking for<br>something to do after General Motors and<br>you were introduced to Mitt Romney what<br>impressed you about the thing that he is<br>he's just a first-class human being he's<br>wonderful<br>morals wonderful family life wonderful<br>principles he's as smart as hell he's<br>got a low ego which i think is<br>incredibly important you see what do you<br>say that and well because he seems to me<br>very steely right yep that's a different<br>thing from an ego you know he was doing<br>it and this again might not come up he<br>was wanting to be present in the knight<br>estates not not so he could say what a<br>great guy he was and that he was<br>president he was doing it for he because<br>he believed that he could make the world<br>a better place that he can make America<br>a better place and he's one of those<br>people when you're in the room and I<br>take a lot from this because I've worked<br>with people who are the opposite to this<br>he didn't have to be the smartest guy in<br>the room even though he was and from a<br>leadership point of view I think that's<br>incredibly important you need to<br>actually be able to listen to people<br>around you and even if you are the<br>smartest guy and even if you are the<br>the person with the best solution<br>listening to the people around you is<br>incredibly important and one of the<br>things that impressed me was he was<br>there and in the meetings I was certain<br>with him he would always seek opinions<br>listen to them make a decision so he was<br>decisive that's different from having a<br>big ego where did you meet him a minimum<br>New York I guess would be about 18<br>months ago now about 1314 months before<br>the election I I knew one of the people<br>who supported him financially very well<br>and I got an introduction through that<br>person I met him and his wife and just<br>did a business setting in New York spent<br>about half an hour with them chatted<br>about what he wanted to do what I wanted<br>to do and you know it was a common<br>meeting of minds did the politics the<br>actual cannabis cloth or the process of<br>politics interest you the most I thought<br>he was the best<br>the closest aligned to where I was<br>conceptually I'm servitude I think he<br>was you know enough in the center that<br>he could have actually brought people<br>together but he was conservative and for<br>my mind the the issues of the day and<br>the issues of the next five to ten years<br>of fiscal they're not social policy I<br>mean social policy is important but it's<br>not what's gonna define the next five to<br>ten years of our life and the US<br>desperately needs a new fiscal direction<br>and he was certainly the closest to how<br>I thought that would happen being too<br>extreme it's not going to happen so you<br>need to be relatively close to the<br>center to actually get something done<br>but it definitely needs a different<br>direction for where it's going at the<br>moment you're also talking about<br>we raised almost a billion dollars a<br>billion yeah you is isn't that isn't<br>that what politics though in the United<br>States is all about it's about who can<br>raise the most money or clearly not do<br>the candidates in today's oh sure yeah I<br>mean sure they yeah they meet they've<br>made it fundraisers and they shake<br>people's hands<br>that aren't necessarily know exactly<br>what chick but you know if you were at a<br>private dinner or something with 20<br>people generally there's a $50,000 asked<br>to go to that dinner so that felt<br>generally speaking no who would it<br>you know who's contributing and all of<br>its made public so the amount you can<br>look online you can see the amount that<br>I go for example or anyone else so to<br>all if you contribute to a pull a<br>political campaign<br>there has to be filed by the the<br>campaign as to the person's name and how<br>much they gave there's another problem<br>though and we see it and I think in this<br>country as well and David Shearer is a<br>good example he did this apartment there<br>were so many people in his ear like<br>Romney's here when they go out to talk<br>it's no worried about making it Gifford<br>end up making again yeah but it depends<br>on whether you think that the key<br>element that you're choosing your leader<br>is their ability to articulate in public<br>so a lot of people do yeah and I my view<br>is that's not the single thing that you<br>should solve for their ability is to<br>make high quality decisions based in yet<br>the prisoner the United States has to<br>make more critical decisions than any<br>one human being probably in the world so<br>the ability to make good quality<br>decisions this pyramid but the<br>correlation between that and their<br>ability to to be a good public speaker<br>in orator there's an overlap that's not<br>a big one it it's the transition team<br>that you were responsible imagining for<br>putting in place in New Zealand of<br>course a government changes the team<br>remains essentially the same I'm talking<br>about the bureaucracy and key people of<br>that some would say that because there<br>is this transition team and because it's<br>a new brew in Washington that you don't<br>have a level of transparency are all<br>sympathetic to the president you know<br>it's not to the public we stopped the<br>process which is an interesting one on<br>that and then address your point it is<br>fascinating because you get a totally<br>new team n and that<br>one of the reasons why I spent six<br>months is is to plan for that fifty<br>years ago if you go back to presidential<br>transitions you know they woke up the<br>day after the election when okay now do<br>I run run this country people figured<br>out that an you know the single biggest<br>country in the world with more issues<br>than you can deal with that wasn't a<br>particularly good way of running her but<br>I'm not sure it's significantly<br>different in the sense that he didn't<br>goes and chooses his team I think one of<br>the things that's positive about the<br>American system and one of the things I<br>enjoyed about doing it is you then go<br>out and handpick the people that you<br>want and they can be the best from any<br>field whether it be political people<br>businesspeople academics think-tank<br>leaders and the quality of an<br>administration is often defined by the<br>choices the president then makes and the<br>people that he had now I would argue<br>that President Obama to be some extent<br>has been disappointing in some of his<br>choices he had especially in his first<br>term where the world was inspired by him<br>becoming president and and he came in<br>with this mess of goodwill and he could<br>have basically you know brought anyone<br>into earnest administration and<br>generally speaking he chose people who<br>had been his loyalists for twenty or<br>thirty years whether they were the right<br>the best people available or not when we<br>sat down with met four or five months<br>before the election because one of the<br>three key things that we had to do in<br>the transition was to create short lists<br>of people who would be take all the<br>senior White House positions and all of<br>the cabinet positions so these people<br>who put up their hands now I'll come to<br>that but but but the point I want to<br>make is what mitt see it is look I am<br>NOT a Washington insider I'm not coming<br>with a hundred people who I'm going to<br>tell you their names and I want you to<br>find spots for him I've got three or<br>four people who I think are incredibly<br>talented who've been with me for a while<br>I'd like to make sure that they have<br>some role in the government but the rest<br>is up to you I want the best and<br>brightest I want you to draw it I don't<br>care who they are what their background<br>is<br>I just want you to find the best<br>possible people because we're on a<br>mission here and comes back to my low<br>low eco point he he didn't care if he<br>had people who outshine him who had a<br>great reputation<br>he didn't care whether their being with<br>him for 30 years or not all he wanted<br>was the best people and I can genuinely<br>say that that because just that was one<br>of the three things that I was primarily<br>responsible for is creating the lists of<br>people so we we had a fantastic field<br>day in terms of actually thinking of<br>people who came from a vastly diverse<br>background now to your point who are<br>they and where do they come from and do<br>they put up pulling power what would be<br>President there's a lot of people they<br>come from different sources and they'll<br>talk a bit about the process so one is<br>the and this is the interesting thing<br>about the American system is when you go<br>out of government you're out but what<br>happens is a lot of people have there<br>been in the political will for 30 years<br>and that's their life they've been<br>disappear into a lobbying group or a<br>think tank or something waiting for the<br>next four year cycle so if you like this<br>this bench of people that sitting there<br>in waiting for their next opportunity so<br>let's assume that gives you one pool of<br>people to draw from<br>then there's the private sector and<br>there's a long history which i think is<br>a positive history of drawing people<br>from the private sector in particular<br>things like secretary of treasury<br>obviously the more economic areas but<br>also secretive calm lists of small<br>business so other areas and so you can<br>draw people from the private sector<br>academia is another big thing so people<br>who might be vice chancellors of<br>universities for example would be other<br>people who might have who might want to<br>come and be in the education field and<br>they sign up for four years or less for<br>that matter<br>and there's obviously people who have<br>been there all their life so they create<br>a body of knowledge that's incredibly<br>important but you also get these other<br>people who just come and say look what a<br>fantastic thing to do for four years of<br>my life to<br>contribute to my country and then go<br>back to my day job what whatever there<br>might be now we don't live people put<br>their hands up we basically said no<br>decisions are going to be made until the<br>day after the election so that you don't<br>get this food fight of people clambering<br>around you inevitably some people you<br>know put their hands up and say should<br>you be interested I would be interested<br>but we did everything essentially blind<br>so no one knew that they were being<br>considered for anything oh really so you<br>can't but you could come up with some<br>bubbly secrets for us here tell us they<br>from the private sector was interest I<br>could not but we did you know one of the<br>interesting is you have to beat all<br>these people because to your point we go<br>back through everyone who we considered<br>for a senior position the prisoner<br>points four thousand people by the way<br>so it's quite a big you know obviously<br>the Secretary of State and Treasury are<br>the ones that people are interested in<br>there's this huge pipeline that you have<br>to fill of under secretaries and deputy<br>secretaries but every person who we<br>considered for the waveone positions as<br>we call them we had to do a vetting off<br>so we had a huge room of people who did<br>nothing else except search the internet<br>for unfortunate quotes or stances on<br>well you know it's all a matter of<br>public record now and it's one of the<br>things we all know you know in the<br>digital world everything you do through<br>your life is recorded yeah New Zealand<br>could learn something from like the<br>bureaucracy I mean we have career<br>bureaucrats going through naturally HIDs<br>departments are example business I think<br>it's incredibly healthy yeah I don't I<br>think you need a mixture obviously you<br>can't have too many people just coming<br>in and then going again you need the<br>experience and particular things like<br>diplomatic areas where the sensitivities<br>are higher but things like economic<br>policy absolutely during the campaign<br>the thing that struck me was that China<br>was almost seen as the bogeyman<br>that was almost reminiscent of Reed's<br>under the beds during Muldoon's era that<br>what are so wrong with China and why why<br>did they try and help score each other<br>on the China's deals well I mean China's<br>the most obvious because it's the bird<br>you know it's the single biggest country<br>in the world outside of the US and it's<br>growing at 19 or so percent a year and<br>it's the biggest trading imbalance that<br>the US has but it's representative of a<br>broader issue which is you're seeing the<br>rise of emerging countries China being<br>the most obvious but there's plenty of<br>other India Southeast Asian countries<br>within South American countries and you<br>sing us has 330 million people you had<br>up the rest of the countries you just<br>talked about it's you know three or four<br>billion so you have this massive change<br>and that will going on and the emergence<br>of of these countries and Bill Gates who<br>your fear too earlier had a great<br>expression which I use a lot which is<br>people under overestimate the short-term<br>impact of things they underestimate the<br>long-term impact of things people have<br>been talking about China for a long time<br>people aren't talking about Asia or any<br>because because it's gonna happen I mean<br>they are going to be a credibly dominant<br>force in the world both economically and<br>politically almost certainly in the next<br>10 to 20 years so it's a bit like a<br>competition I don't like well it's more<br>than just that I mean if you look at the<br>unemployment situation in the US which<br>is one of the biggest issues that the<br>domestically is facing it's it's 8<br>percent but it's actually higher than<br>that if you take the people who are just<br>don't even bother applying for work it's<br>the highest structural unemployment<br>become country's head since the nineteen<br>thirties the Great Depression and it's<br>not going to change in what you have in<br>the world at the moment is and this is<br>the flipside of productivity and<br>outsourcing is you<br>a massive dislocation of a huge number<br>of people who are unskilled so if you<br>think there's you know three types of<br>jobs in the will this skilled and<br>localized so think engineers or<br>architects it's it's very hard to<br>outsource those that's unskilled and<br>very hard to outsource so think waiters<br>and hairdressers so there's people are<br>fine although the second groove aren't<br>going to earn much money and then the<br>third group is skilled and outsource<br>upon so think manufacturing jobs and and<br>in the world that we're talking about<br>and in what the rise of China those jobs<br>have gone and then unlikely to come back<br>without a significant change and when<br>you have literally billions of people in<br>the world who are willing to work for a<br>significantly lower price and do the<br>same job in those skilled areas you have<br>a massive problem and it's not just a<br>it's not a competition thing it's a how<br>do you deal with the reality of that<br>situation but then both Romney and Obama<br>are being may be disingenuous what they<br>were saying we want to keep jobs in this<br>country well you have you have to have a<br>vision of how you're gonna create the<br>jobs otherwise you can't just say oh<br>we're going to except you know 10%<br>unemployment forever but so you have to<br>have a vision but protecting them and<br>trying to keep them there by you know<br>trade policy unlikely to be successful<br>will never been successful in the<br>history of mankind<br>unlikely to be so you get into things<br>like education policy and how do you<br>retrain people and train people for the<br>will that we're going into and that's<br>where the argument was much more<br>interesting than you know she's China's<br>currency overvalued or undervalued we<br>because we want to take some questions<br>shortly but if you look at New Zealand<br>and New Zealand's place in the world I<br>mean New Zealand was little more than a<br>blip on the radar screen really and<br>right back to the mid 80s following<br>David Longley and the anti-nuclear<br>legislation and George Shultz saying we<br>part as friends and : powell saying<br>we're very<br>very very good friends and right you<br>know positive spin being put on all of<br>that<br>why and basically telling us to get<br>stuffed but why are we so worried why<br>were they so worried about Zealand I<br>mean we are so small but insignificant<br>well Americans by nature and this is one<br>of things I like them out generally<br>speaking black and white and you're<br>either you're an ally or you're not and<br>you know sometimes you define whether an<br>ally by whether you you know support the<br>causes now of course New Zealand has a<br>fantastic history of the u.s. I think<br>we're the only country made with<br>Australia of having fought every war<br>alongside America so there's no question<br>that we have historically been an ally<br>but the nuclear thing obviously was a<br>test of that and subsequently okay we've<br>moved on from that which is great but<br>Americans judge people's actions by<br>whether they align themselves or not and<br>America sees itself the bitter or is is<br>the under policeman of the world and so<br>having people as allies is proned em<br>critically from their perspective New<br>Zealand it as I said it's tiny<br>I mean then Washington do we raise it<br>all I think Mike mores done a fantastic<br>job I think it's a you know we couldn't<br>ask for a better ambassador there and<br>you know he's now being called Prime<br>Minister years rather than weeks but he<br>was here well I think you know it is<br>driven around in individuals and<br>personality and Mike really has done a<br>great job there New Zealand is it's true<br>you know the boxing above our weight or<br>whatever the the metaphor is we do that<br>politically as well relative to the size<br>of the country we have an outsourced<br>presence there people are very positive<br>about the country they love coming here<br>they know New Zealanders Mike's done a<br>great job know we are you know we had a<br>list of countries that president-elect<br>Romney was going to bring on the day<br>after the election I hate to say New<br>Zealand wasn't in the top five Lauren<br>when they go I do I fell down on the job<br>on that one so yeah we have to be<br>realistic that with our 4.4 million<br>people or whatever we aren't we aren't a<br>giant politically but we're definitely<br>disproportionate to our size why is it<br>so important just bit of a corollary to<br>that why is it so important that we have<br>a seat non-permanent seat of the United<br>Nations Security Council I mean the last<br>couple of weeks in South America he was<br>lobbying furiously<br>for it I can't speak to the end of the<br>specifics of the seat or not I don't<br>know to be honest why do I say fluids<br>why do I think we should have a role I<br>mean I think New Zealand is seen as a<br>very honest broker in situations and our<br>opinion counts because we are neutral if<br>you like and we're not because we don't<br>have a huge vested interest in the and<br>the result of a lot of these things<br>we're seeing as you know we're<br>intelligent<br>we're moderate and so I think people<br>respect our opinion yeah you see when<br>you went into this business of politics<br>that was going to be a fascinating<br>experience or an alternative career of<br>what was the alternative career if we'd<br>won I would definitely like to work in<br>the administration so if you don't what<br>could you see yourself we play by our<br>own rules so there was no even for the<br>people who worked on the transition<br>there were no guaranteed jobs at all all<br>that was to come straight afterwards why<br>would you like that is it I I think the<br>world is at a fascinating juncture at<br>the moment or some of the things we've<br>touched on and particularly pin on works<br>which is clearly more my interest and I<br>think what you it the u.s. does despite<br>the rise of China the u.s. is still the<br>most powerful and influential country in<br>the world by a distance and so to be<br>involved in that process for four plus<br>years and to be close to the<br>decision-making associated with economic<br>policy in the US and therefore by<br>definition the world I can't think of<br>anything more intellectually interesting<br>than<br>you go to remain involved yeah I you<br>know it's a four year cycle so I'll make<br>I'll make the specific decision in three<br>and a half years or so but one of the<br>things I did post-election is I've<br>documented everything that we did in the<br>transition<br>I saw co-wrote a book with one of my<br>colleagues there and we to some extent<br>created the gold standard in transition<br>planning even though it wasn't<br>implemented by applying some of the prog<br>basic project management skills that are<br>fed to a little bit of the engineering<br>training and me but we transitions<br>generally aren't the primary focus your<br>friends wants to be on the campaign<br>because it's be the excitement is that's<br>what the debates are until about a month<br>out from the election and they start<br>getting very interested in the<br>transition so it's a nice little leash<br>as that I sort of worked on and so I've<br>documented all of what we did and we're<br>publishing the book in a month or two<br>but that gives me something that I could<br>pick up in three years time and do again<br>if I felt so inclined<br>just finally before we go to questions<br>yeah election night I was in Chicago<br>assumedly you were in Washington now<br>Boston you were up in Boston did you<br>think at the beginning of that day that<br>Romney could still win yeah I think<br>everybody did everyone did and you know<br>turnouts a fickle thing that's the<br>problem really and you don't know until<br>the votes are counted and sometimes the<br>mood at the country can be more<br>unexpected there have been a lot of<br>surprises as you will know having been<br>in business a lot longer than me there<br>can be surprises I think we were<br>realistic we had an outside shot but we<br>definitely thought we had a shot and I<br>mean one of the interesting things is<br>and you know if you destroy Paul with<br>people you know what did President<br>Obama's how many votes did he get this<br>time relative to how many got last time<br>most people would think all about the<br>same mama he got about 10% less so he<br>the one of the elements of what we<br>thought would happen which was the bid<br>enthusiasm drop-off from Oh 8 to 12<br>happened what we didn't do is we did<br>get the enthusiasm pick up so we got an<br>extra million votes he got about five<br>million less than what he did but it<br>shows you here he had a five million<br>votes wing and we had a five million<br>positive votes wing then we would have<br>won the election so it's possible it is<br>much higher there isn't it for a<br>challenger than an incumbent yeah the<br>the the incumbent differently has<br>advantages the building the warchest the<br>building of what what's described is the<br>ground game which is getting votes out<br>so obviously if you know you are going<br>to be the candidate you've got four<br>years to build a nationwide series of<br>officers that that start to connect with<br>people and you build an information<br>system and this might sound technical<br>but it's in fact it's incredibly<br>important because of the turnout factor<br>that I talked about and literally people<br>and the Obama campaign were very good at<br>this they they they did an exceptional<br>job things like as someone would come in<br>and vote and they'd come out they'd you<br>know tick them off and they get that<br>person to ring their neighbor know yeah<br>if someone like someone just rings<br>anonymously and says would love you to<br>go out and vote you probably don't do it<br>if your neighbor rings you you probably<br>do and of course because you have four<br>years generally speaking you can figure<br>out who's going to vote which way people<br>it registers Republicans or Democrats<br>and some extended dependents so you have<br>a real ability to actually get down on a<br>grassroots level and think about how you<br>get better turnout if you or the<br>Challenger you got six months to do it<br>how tough was it finally we will go to<br>questions but how tough was it the when<br>the sandy storm hit the United States<br>and during the campaign and Obama goes<br>back to the White House and Romney is<br>sort of sitting there there holding his<br>heels for two or three days that must<br>have been terribly frustrated it was a<br>particular urn and it's all lost in<br>history in our course but there was<br>definitely a bit of a momentum pickup in<br>those last few days and<br>of the rallies on the Romney side were<br>getting bigger but you know honestly I I<br>think it was effective or wasn't the<br>effector I don't think it I don't think<br>it made the difference<br>okay well we'll open it up for questions<br>I'm sure there are many more intelligent<br>questions than of us tonight so we've<br>got a microphone going around the<br>audience so if you do want to ask a<br>question raise your hand and we've got<br>one down here and we'll get a microphone<br>to you Chris from your international<br>experience of such a high level of<br>business and government if you had the<br>opportunity to come back to New Zealand<br>and wave a magic wand what key thing or<br>things would you actually change well I<br>think this is probably true of the US as<br>well I and it's not just because we're<br>sitting here but education policy to me<br>is the single most important thing in<br>terms of to get right in terms of the<br>world that we're going into I think New<br>Zealand actually has has done remarkably<br>well over the last decade economically<br>so I wouldn't get into infrastructure<br>spending and things like that all of<br>those are important but we got our<br>education policy so that we were<br>producing world-class graduates right<br>and we had the top three and there's no<br>reason why we couldn't be in skills<br>right through every age five through<br>University Wow<br>that would make more difference in this<br>country than anything else I can think<br>of so if I could make it wave a magic<br>wand of me there another question<br>hi Chris I'm you actually spoke at my<br>graduation from Oakland University about<br>13 years ago so I'm currently work for<br>Intel on I live in Hong Kong two<br>questions for you if you can say<br>anything about the the innovation<br>programs or the technology programs that<br>mit romney was putting in place and<br>specifically about mr. Paul Otellini who<br>has just turned in as a resignation from<br>Intel and subsequently after MIT didn't<br>come into power and that would be<br>interesting but more importantly over<br>the next 10 years where do you see New<br>Zealand taking advantage of China and<br>the growth in China from whether a<br>business standpoint or an export from<br>New Zealand to China standpoint one of<br>the tragedies of the u.s. to address<br>your question on one aspect of it one of<br>the tragedies the USA is it does have or<br>used to have the premier education<br>system in the world<br>it certainly still got something like 15<br>at the top 20 universities in the world<br>but one of the things that does is then<br>exports all the graduates and one of the<br>big political campaign discussions was<br>one earth don't as you graduate from MIT<br>you staple a green card to your diploma<br>as you come out and it's crazy the u.s.<br>is basically educating the Chinese and<br>Indian populations so you know one of<br>the big things there is they have the<br>world-class universities they have a<br>fantastic history and pedigree of people<br>coming in but they come and then go and<br>if you could do one thing to change the<br>US because it has been the world<br>certainly in the technology sense the<br>world's innovator it would be to keep<br>all of those people you know how do you<br>keep you know the Indians and Chinese<br>and Eastern Europeans of this world<br>inside the US system because with<br>Silicon Valley and what's happening in<br>Boston and New York you've just got a<br>fantastic machine that just keeps<br>producing you know new the Facebook's<br>and<br>newcomers as well as the mature<br>businesses in terms of New Zealand and<br>China I'm not sure I can speak that<br>authoritative lead to it to be honest<br>obviously we have a very strong you know<br>growth there in terms of adding value to<br>where products was something I spent a<br>lot of time in the car to halt probably<br>wasn't as successful as I would like to<br>be but rather than just you know<br>producing world product and sending it<br>up to China having a value-added<br>strategy is and I can't say I can I take<br>you like that but that would seem to me<br>the biggest single opportunity we've got<br>you know we produce a lot of protein we<br>produce a lot of fiber but the Chinese<br>want thinking about how we add the value<br>here rather than there would be the<br>the Pope at his inauguration in Rome<br>said that the role of the church is to<br>serve the people if the Republican Party<br>had won the presidential election would<br>they have seen their role to serve the<br>people of United States who would it<br>have been to rule in favor of a certain<br>proportion of those people is that the<br>47th city yeah the I think that once the<br>campaign is over both parties have a<br>very proud history of actually then<br>trying to do the best thing for the<br>country obviously there's fundamental<br>differences in the way in which they<br>interpret what that beast means but do I<br>think a Mitt Romney administration or a<br>Republican administration would have<br>only been interested in one half of the<br>population no and that's never been the<br>history of the Republican Party it's<br>never in the history of the Democrat<br>Party either so what happens on the<br>campaign trail when they fight each<br>other like hell is one thing what that<br>happens in government is another and you<br>have to remember that one of the<br>interesting things about the u.s. system<br>is there's three legs the government the<br>presidential being the most obvious one<br>but then the Senate and the house being<br>the others so you tend to get<br>much more representative form of<br>government simply because it's very<br>unusual to have all of those three legs<br>of the government held by one party or<br>another the last time actually<br>interestingly was you know in just up<br>2008 when the Democrats held all three<br>but generally speaking you you get a<br>much more balanced equation for better<br>or for worse because you have split<br>government between those three parties<br>but you know obviously given the spirit<br>of your question do I think that the<br>Republicans were single mindedly only<br>interested in the people who are back in<br>them and do I think mcgraw me neither he<br>was a much bigger person than them just<br>one question while we're waiting I was<br>thinking Governor Christie well if you<br>stay in the political arena basically<br>backing him working for him do I think<br>he would be that candidate who wins I<br>think he's got a good chance but it's<br>really early days there's there's three<br>or four relatively young candidates in<br>the Republican Party who within another<br>three years will be very strong<br>contenders so I think he is a contender<br>but not hi Chris<br>with the us being embroiled in the<br>sequester spending cuts right now in<br>your opinion under Romney administration<br>would this have still happened and what<br>type of fiscal policy would he have<br>implemented to prevent it no I don't<br>think would have happened because I<br>think they he would have made a much<br>stronger and more<br>sometimes you need a change in order to<br>effect change and unfortunately<br>President Obama basically has carried on<br>the same approach as he had in the first<br>four years entirely his prerogative but<br>hasn't been successful in terms of<br>bringing people together I think MIT<br>would have been much more successful in<br>bringing people together and just<br>sometimes a different person and<br>different personality makes a difference<br>I also think he would have put in place<br>a different fiscal policy on the<br>and actually being able to give people a<br>vision of a change it's one of the<br>reasons why I signed up for him so no I<br>don't think the sequester would have<br>happened in the way that I did under his<br>leadership but who knows would have also<br>depending on the composition of the<br>other two parts but you know the the<br>interesting thing is both parties think<br>the sequester is a dumb idea so you have<br>a crazy situation where neither party<br>actually wants it to happen but they<br>were unable to resolve a middle ground<br>to change it and yet you know one of the<br>fascinating things as democracies aren't<br>particularly well set up for taking<br>things away from people<br>generally speaking the last couple<br>hundred years they've been about how do<br>you divide an increasing pie you know<br>the u.s. is you see it in Europe in<br>particular but the u.s. is now facing<br>how does a democracy deal with a<br>shortage of resource and not a shrinking<br>pie but a pie that is growing too slowly<br>to cater for all the demands that it has<br>upon us that's a really tough challenge<br>so you know it's gonna have to change<br>course good evening could you rate the<br>two social media campaigns and the Ender<br>can compare the effectiveness and did<br>they really make a difference<br>I believe so there was I think there's a<br>report just come out I've been here for<br>few days I haven't seen her by the<br>Republican Party and analysis of the<br>social media campaign so I'd be<br>interested to read that I think the<br>certainly anecdotally the Obama campaign<br>was vastly more effective you know that<br>tended to appeal to a much younger<br>demographic for a start which obviously<br>helps in this it also it built on a lot<br>of the how successful they worked in<br>2008 and carried that on it was a little<br>so mentioned before one of the benefits<br>of incumbency is you can carry it you<br>know you can have a four-year campaign<br>rather than a six-month campaign but<br>they were very effective and they had<br>some very good people and I think you<br>know you would say the Republican Party<br>were we're okay the Obama campaign was<br>gold standard<br>and did do I think it made a difference<br>here I do well I think we could probably<br>wrap it up there Chris it's been<br>fantastic having it yo I'm sure I speak<br>on behalf of everybody here tonight<br>great to be back in the country<br>thank you somebody suggested earlier<br>maybe you should come back and give<br>politics here then it's been great great<br>talking to you<br>I'm sure we could have gone on longer I<br>know you've got to go out and see a bit<br>of Auckland tonight thank you very much<br>okay<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
