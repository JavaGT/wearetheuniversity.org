want to jump on the<br>plane go straight to the airport so go<br>and say one of your wonderful hotels<br>which is what are we doing that's right<br>Gavin welcome it's a real pleasure to<br>have you here and welcome to spray talk<br>and thank you for your time I'm always<br>interested in creating some context<br>about you know where people started out<br>to get to where they are today so I'd<br>like to start by taking you back to your<br>time but why for a high school in<br>Taranaki and there was a nice point that<br>I found in the National Business Review<br>and I seen it will give sit here tonight<br>with us it seemed for a freezing worker<br>you've done rather well because you did<br>start out in the freezing works in here<br>that's the way i had to pay my<br>university fees yes so yeah i'm a<br>freezing wigan and a car park attendant<br>we say it was it with some early lessons<br>there for you and in understanding that<br>business or was there to motivation we<br>decided that you had to find another<br>career pathway oh it didn't help my<br>language 15 if you ever work in the<br>freezing works but it's some alleged to<br>get on with people at all levels and I<br>know is it what it was exciting to him<br>just hear what they're doing in them<br>made you decide to have you had to do<br>something else yeah we motivated as a<br>child you one of these you know<br>ambitious young people who was going to<br>forge a path to success from a young age<br>I don't know you have to ask my brothers<br>other all the whole family always with<br>us of the front row here as well Sam I<br>think you know I think that all say that<br>I started in business when I was<br>probably ten years old yeah when anthony<br>from make money out of mowing lawns 222<br>i'm starting a sort of commercial life<br>we also had a commercial life and the M<br>and the Foursquare business grocery<br>shops just like Maggie Thatcher and it's<br>and that's where we learned how to UM do<br>possess and communicate and handle<br>people so you decided to become a<br>chartered accountant you picture Bates<br>move to that well known universe my<br>mother decided your mother decided okay<br>so you paint your baits you hit it to<br>that other well-known University in<br>Wellington and and then you gained your<br>your qualification and then you jumped<br>on a plane and you went to Hong Kong why<br>the decision to go to Hong Kong because<br>i found that intriguing in 1973 we<br>generally everybody was beating a path<br>to London well I said I was reading the<br>Dominion and there's a said vestment for<br>a job in Hong Kong as a charter captain<br>and the air fares were free so I<br>couldn't resist and me and also all my<br>all my other friends went to UM London<br>you know you get a university together i<br>SAT up working for ey and Wellington and<br>say your work with the people you<br>studied with and either well let's do<br>something different and this opportunity<br>in Hong Kong I wasn't even quite sure<br>where Hong Kong was but this is nineteen<br>nineteen seventy three and jump on a<br>plane and headed north what was your<br>reaction when you got here well it's<br>hard to explain it was we then in a<br>typhoon hey Jesse doing Hong Kong um we<br>stopped off and Indonesia on their way<br>and it's um and there was another shock<br>to the system vista number of people the<br>excitement and so on our way they were<br>into indonesia singapore and bangkok so<br>it wasn't such a cultural shock but just<br>just the magnitude the speed and an<br>industry excitement of waking them a<br>huge fear coming from a very small firm<br>and was this unbelievable in one of<br>those clients that you were assigned to<br>was petered out chief we'll see where<br>right at that time that happen is your<br>homework hotel when you meet her did you<br>did you realize that the influence that<br>he was going to subsequently be in your<br>life the major influence not really not<br>really he was of course he was the big<br>guru of hotel business and and i joined<br>the peninsula group which was a client<br>of KPMG and this is what you know<br>happens of your clients take the staff<br>from the audit team and um he was a very<br>larger-than-life person and um and of<br>course was developments coming called<br>the peninsula group so it's um n right<br>from the start he and I got on very well<br>because um you can see the hotel<br>industry is backed by the Swiss business<br>business people s we had started from<br>the real international Swiss business<br>and I was the only non Swiss and sort of<br>you know I'd go into meetings and at all<br>it's a stop speaking Swiss German<br>bittersweet just for me and they also<br>made that point what he what did he<br>teach about what were his values what it<br>wanted you what did you take from there<br>early association with them that may<br>have embedded itself in your psyche so<br>it's good well he showed you even do<br>anything you know he M you know he<br>developed the Peninsula Hotel which is<br>one of the hotels of the world we<br>developed hotels and the Philippines and<br>Singapore and he had he had this nothing<br>was impossible and and and that's really<br>what life's about if nothing's<br>impossible you can achieve what a year<br>after and then and he's very<br>motivational person you know he he spoke<br>he didn't you didn't need a telephone to<br>talk to him because he was so loud and I<br>said it just he literally shake the room<br>actually it was a theme that you started<br>to concede this idea that maybe that<br>televisions might be a business that you<br>put it up in yourself it's had you know<br>I I can't lie to much in front of my<br>family but it's only opportunities come<br>and and you know was just that I by the<br>time I was 31 I was head of the finance<br>division financial agree which was was<br>exciting and and and as I said<br>opportunity came came up and numb and<br>it's also how I developed convector New<br>Zealand to the hotel business was just a<br>lucky phone call I lucky contact and<br>someone says hey you want to try<br>something India I just thought some of<br>these opportunities out there all the<br>time doesn't matter what state the<br>world's in what state the economy's in<br>is always an opportunity and then we<br>fast-forward up to the age of 34 you get<br>approached and down and you become the<br>chief executive of Kings gate the<br>publicly listed company with 20 hotels<br>and I understand you once described the<br>experiences absolutely terrifying did<br>you really know what you were doing or<br>you were just making it up as you went<br>along I have no idea I was album I was<br>actually introduced to the owners of of<br>the Kings Eden heart chain of australia<br>new zealand by a new zealand banker<br>gentleman called Jordan rose and and and<br>I went through visit these people in<br>Singapore with weather with no attention<br>of anything there was this an<br>opportunity and then I got a phone call<br>two months later say hey would you like<br>this job and yes I came I came to um<br>yeah I had no idea what I was doing as I<br>was of my first public company also I<br>was a CEO at 34 I had 20 hotels in New<br>Zealand the company was owned I gotta be<br>kiddin when one picks bankers is here<br>but but the chemicals was literally<br>bankrupt it was a negative cash flow and<br>so it was them exciting times and we're<br>building hotels we couldn't pay our<br>bills the Fletcher's and you know the<br>story goes off and then we turned it<br>into something which worked what we see<br>spotty strategy at the attire matsuya<br>strategy was five lot busier what was<br>what was the what were you thinking<br>about what you were working to today<br>today well it was just really to to to<br>bring the a team together we bring the<br>UM but the people together I'm I don't<br>know if people remember the higher than<br>eight nineteen eighty-three the service<br>was so bad was unbelievable so you said<br>it was unbelievable you know and so I<br>would eat with the staff and try and get<br>close to them was not easy and the<br>course says were the days of them of<br>unionism and you know and I had the port<br>I would sit down he's the head of the<br>Union tell me how I should run the hotel<br>he probably knew more than I did but um<br>but do we get a little over obviously I<br>didn't know that so I was real real<br>challenging times how exciting how did<br>you manage staff motivation first it's a<br>bit director you just have to be open<br>and honest and and and you know do what<br>they do you know make bids of made bids<br>and the old had when they were on strike<br>we made the beds and and and they sort<br>of start looking at you and say hey it<br>was this guy is one of us and he's here<br>to make it you know better so so it's um<br>it's really it's just like playing a<br>game of rugby you just get beside them<br>and say hey and it takes time it takes<br>time and you know I I always say there's<br>no no bad stuff is just bad management<br>as well as the management here the<br>staffroom campaign was taffy only<br>inviting the management and slowly<br>return things around and end um instead<br>of making money flowed it off another<br>public company<br>enjoyed the sharemarket beam of 95 86 97<br>I've been cried Randy tried with me cry<br>brightener didn't never Gibson read it<br>off in 1990 and then talk about nineteen<br>ninety Peter Gaussian makes you an offer<br>to join what he described as a little<br>hotel company what was the reading<br>hesitation on your part when he offered<br>you the chance to to join him in what<br>was what is of course potentially were<br>the most competitive sectors in the<br>world well it well it was there was a<br>tricky decision but you know I am I<br>decided that I wanted to look at doing<br>things for myself or looking at business<br>opportunity so I flew that I was in<br>Singapore and I flew to hong kong and<br>had a coffee with me said do you want to<br>join me out said well you know i'm sure<br>but what I don't want to live in Hong<br>Kong he said well you know hey how can<br>you work for me if you don't live in<br>Hong Kong so I said I'll give you three<br>weeks a month and it's a nice it in<br>three weeks idea what anybody can do in<br>a month and that's how we started and so<br>used to flying on a on a Sunday night<br>and leave 20 days later on a Thursday<br>night and and you you you you are forced<br>to do things and this is one the<br>problems I I see there some bad you're<br>not forced to to head hit the timelines<br>and so is it okay let's have a go and I<br>said I don't know where it's going to<br>work so I work for the first 3 months<br>for nothing I said I work for you for<br>nothing to see if it works and it's also<br>um takes pressure off you and um and you<br>concentrate on<br>on doing a successful job and of course<br>that gave me another week a month back<br>in New Zealand um to think about other<br>ideas and that's how I thought about<br>other opportunities how did you feel at<br>the end of eight three months there was<br>no hesitation it just it just kept going<br>and and I think we got a mutual respect<br>for each other and there's some two or<br>three hours in the company and the way<br>we went and that someone yeah I had no I<br>had no hesitation taller was just was<br>just at hey this this is going to work<br>at I said okay I'll deal my family I'd<br>do it for two or three years and 30<br>years later I'm still doing it give us<br>the seats of all of your vision at that<br>time what were you what were you seeking<br>to achieve because I said this is an<br>enormously competitive sector a<br>combination every you know you think<br>that every niche was taken why did you<br>think then that you could enter that<br>market and still come up with a winning<br>well call of course I mean you're<br>sleeping next door to China you know<br>Hong Kong is three to four hours flight<br>from 75 percent of the world's<br>population if you take India and and<br>when you've got two thousand million<br>people who've never had a holiday so so<br>cities know there's no risk of business<br>there's only risk of your own stupidity<br>or given the product wrong or managing<br>it wrong and there's plenty of room for<br>for for everybody and um so so I don't<br>think I could be as that arrogance I had<br>a vision you know my life was something<br>i saw say a series of accidents or<br>opportunities this like my mother<br>telling me to be an accountant<br>I understand though you did identify<br>that the idea of going into one among<br>might describe a second-tier markets to<br>to think about a particular strategy of<br>going into areas that might not<br>otherwise be serviced yes sir you know<br>the potential group of six star five or<br>six third visit us and then it's hard<br>because the gifts they are very<br>demanding and you can make mistakes for<br>four star business as long as you almost<br>get it right you're okay hi there's a<br>lot of tolerance when I was right of<br>course because there's better drivers<br>you know you know the UM and and I tell<br>people he's one do market market<br>research just woke up in an aeroplane<br>first class is getting smaller economies<br>getting bigger so there's your story and<br>and that's so this one I get a 43 and<br>budget hotel business that's where it's<br>going to happen so it's going to happen<br>what we see what was your approach we<br>working with with developing surgery<br>what how did you create this this<br>association because you were looking for<br>some fairly fast growth fairly quickly<br>well you know Peter Gerety had great<br>connections and it's just a matter of<br>networking you know you know this is um<br>this is you know I'm always on the<br>telephone I'm always talking to people<br>even if they don't listen to me but but<br>it's just looking for opportunities and<br>it's not that difficult yeah when I when<br>I opened up and Dubai I just got off the<br>plane and with with over the suitcases<br>his and started talking to people and<br>you know I found when the top general<br>managers of the biggest hotel in Dubai<br>was my banquet manager in the higher 10<br>years ago 20 years ago and this goes of<br>me get introductions and you meet<br>developers you meet owners and it's just<br>it's exciting you make lots of mistakes<br>so sorry so this idea of neat working<br>head away<br>this critical go DNA sure you have to<br>you have to you have to I mean why<br>father was a networker my brothers are<br>networkers so is this what it's all<br>about it's just people people you know<br>it's um and as disparity of DNA correct<br>and I understand another one of your<br>strategies was that you follow the Year<br>likes you said the Alliance were always<br>at the head of a game in terms of<br>knowing where to be so you you were<br>trailing in behind where the labor<br>something yeah we'll see as I was I<br>would certain the hotel I was we're<br>managing in Jakarta and I'll meet all<br>these aircrew the male ones mainly but<br>their crew and I've talked to them and<br>and I met the Emirates I'm at in CF and<br>suddenly you find out we're all the<br>businesses so you're conducting market<br>research well all I all I all I want to<br>do is follow emirates airline right you<br>know you know people I tell people that<br>Emirates flies for flights for 380 s to<br>New Zealand every day it sounds crazy<br>till the little island down here and if<br>you look at emirates airlines that's<br>where in Cathay Pacific that's where the<br>business of so you don't have to do any<br>research sitting there waiting you know<br>it affect these days you fly on<br>Everett's if you talk the whole way I've<br>done yeah unfortunate for my staff is<br>that because he was now his own as then<br>Wi-Fi you talk in your phone and your<br>computer I just ate just as at a site<br>the first time you tried this know you<br>were asking me they fly to take every<br>three minutes to the to reassure you<br>about the charges I don't know that you<br>was a 15-hour flight named up working<br>for fifteen hours and that and I thought<br>I was I thought it would go bankrupt by<br>the mayor needs not a problem what was<br>that an eighty dollars so but it's just<br>and also it's the fun of working if it's<br>on my staff and travel with me because<br>they cannot ever sleep because I<br>so gleefully refused to play with me the<br>talk about this stuff I understand your<br>stuff if we if we go back to the asian<br>financial crisis in nineteen<br>ninety-seven ninety-eight ninety-nine I<br>understand you staffing it up living in<br>one particular hotel during during the<br>worst of the crisis in fact things were<br>so bad at occupancy i think was down<br>about five percent you were having to<br>pay them in rice to just been looking at<br>all asleep yes the hotel Jupiter jerk<br>adalah riots started and um my friend<br>Heather knows all about it let's start<br>there started and the early 90s the<br>exchange rate of the rupee went from<br>2,500 to 16 and a half thousand and<br>three months I'm you know there's cars<br>burning the car park was a real lovin<br>disaster and so the staff had lived in<br>the hotel we we had no money the most<br>companies were bankrupt we said we paid<br>the staff the rice we we recruited the<br>army the amulet lived in the cab back<br>basement of the hotel to particular<br>hotel and that some Ella's room you know<br>challenging times for a hotel with jump<br>I need someone from Becca Carter here<br>tonight but ISM was built by becca<br>Carter and is you talk about networking<br>so Ron Carter was a friend of the<br>developer and Peter gotcha was a friend<br>of the developer and then the three of<br>us got together build a hotel Becca kada<br>designed that and supervise it so till<br>of New Zealanders helped in development<br>of Jakara what were you worried at that<br>point that that you were going to<br>survive no you open you learn how to<br>them and just like the Reformers<br>learning heaven live today you just have<br>to be very very careful you don't spend<br>until we have a dollar and and and you<br>you look at every cost and it's in fact<br>it's much easier to<br>no crisis to manage in a boom time is<br>very hard because people get lazy they<br>get sloppy you waste money you think<br>nothing will fail but managing the joint<br>crisis are simple because there's only<br>one word it's no yeah if I wants to do<br>sales it wouldn't know and in that also<br>you know brings a team together what<br>struck me in the in the research for the<br>interview was your your skills as a<br>people person what your ability to<br>improvise very placing a few staffers<br>were already alluded to and in an<br>interview that you gave to the jakarta<br>post in 2013 you see this the excitement<br>of local people when companies believe<br>in their economic potential is priceless<br>we are very involved and very personal<br>when it comes to our relationship with<br>local folks but what have you learned in<br>your career in terms of of of that idea<br>of how you enter physically work in<br>communities to drive the outcomes that<br>the value propositions that you're<br>looking for we have to you have to<br>remember i come from right around so so<br>i come from a small village and so<br>workings in underdeveloped areas and<br>indonesia work and china work on<br>secondary cities as much but easier than<br>the big fancy cities and and this is<br>what makes it so exciting because that<br>the hotel industry brings jobs for<br>everybody and and lots of cases that<br>brings jobs for people have never heard<br>of job I've never had a future they're<br>not educated and until the tourism<br>industry starts they actually have no no<br>future and this exciting thing to to to<br>bring some to bring bring jobs to the<br>people the economy's the family is that<br>I used to know all the families but not<br>anymore obviously that's too big but you<br>know when I get a place like Jo Peru and<br>and Indonesia these little villages and<br>these um and then people I've got a<br>uniform for the first time in their<br>lives I've got food for the first time<br>their lives it's really really<br>fascinating him and I remember sitting<br>at the end of our hotel and JEP realism<br>Papua and and I set me aside gentlemen I<br>said and he said who are you and I<br>similarly who were you know I said well<br>I'm on the publican and he said well I'm<br>the archbishop he is a Roman Catholic<br>archbishop but he is even as casual<br>clothes without you you know it's just<br>and you you never get it you don't get<br>that in New York don't you live in<br>London is it is that what drives is that<br>important to you it I think so but it is<br>just part of the part of the fabric and<br>life of thumb of business amazing it<br>drives me it's because people say I'm a<br>fail we can never achieve it or you<br>can't do it and that's when I feel I can<br>I mean they say you can do it I get<br>scared because you know that right but<br>um what drives me is that that you know<br>my people wouldn't have a go I would say<br>hey look you know it's this try<br>something this talk about some of the<br>influences on the business you know<br>pricing of course and the idea of<br>technology what if all of these sites<br>that can can discount how difficult is<br>it to manage you yield in the hotel<br>business these days when everybody's<br>trying to put the ticket a lot and way<br>it's a total battle you know too but you<br>know you know the guest tells you what<br>he is going to pay these days and and<br>this is why it's um it's a challenge so<br>you have to you know rear end light on<br>stock market in the in this case through<br>and find the cheapest rate the cheapest<br>price of anywhere in the world takes 22<br>minutes but there's also what's exciting<br>that that I've grown my company because<br>I could never do it I could never I<br>could never compete with higher or<br>sheraton on the international scene if<br>it wasn't for these these three things<br>here which is you know my museum phone<br>my international phone and my business<br>cards that's all you need yeah and then<br>this here is some ten times as big as<br>the first computer I head for an eight<br>hundred room hotel yeah and this is just<br>the huge change and you don't need to<br>tell people where you are because you're<br>there you're weak and you're everywhere<br>so the internet is is amazing and it<br>also makes it very easy to them or not<br>easy but allows you to compete it's<br>changed the game Thunder it's changed<br>your business or what assumes that many<br>of your business models actually<br>couldn't operate without impossible<br>impossible nervous that will they let in<br>the internet platform without without<br>the website business we couldn't survive<br>you even the business just would not<br>develop they're talking about innovation<br>because it's the other you know buzzword<br>of the moment of course it how is how<br>how do you approach innovation we're<br>going to shortly at another video of<br>your latest offering but tell us about<br>how you approach this idea of spotting<br>new opportunities you gaps in the market<br>that you think that you can fill well<br>the biggest thing is you have to learn<br>you have been willing to learn a lot of<br>people won't change I mean hotel<br>business is very conservative and so<br>when I hear something I go and have a<br>look at it or you know as I'm three<br>weeks ago food Amsterdam just for the<br>for a day just have a look at a hotel<br>there which is called citizen in amazing<br>hotel and and it's all automatic checkin<br>it's some the bedrooms are seventeen<br>twenty square meters you know the beard<br>touches the wall on three sides but it<br>was jumping so you is really intimate<br>yeah defeater God to differentiate<br>my wife say I was by myself if I was<br>absolutely right but the toilet is in<br>the bedroom and this is in the middle of<br>bedroom literally and it has screens<br>which come around so it's like a<br>cylinder the shower also the middle<br>bedroom and you just close that what's<br>the rate that I got for free yeah I'm<br>sure he would agree but what's everybody<br>else by kicking like I'm sure that<br>they'll be paying hundred and fifty<br>years right but it was it was it was<br>amazing just a hole and then in the<br>lobby was the bar and the restaurant and<br> all together and then conference<br>rooms was it was just in them it's just<br>a bunch of young guys they've already<br>got 20 hotels which they own and it's is<br>what the people want so would you<br>describe yourself as a as a as a<br>customer driven business or do you like<br>to see that at the time of the style and<br>they hope the customers they in the age<br>of you happy customer driven otherwise<br>you die because the customer is always<br>right the person who's paying is right<br>every time like so if the gas is paying<br>the other boss I tell myself I'm paying<br>I'm the boss you know and once you learn<br>that life is easy but when you get it<br>wrong way around<br>I need to fill in those those things<br>that they leave in the hotel room this<br>question is yeah and I'm think that the<br>problem is I think that many people ever<br>feel of another people who want to<br>complain are they you know so what a<br>free room here yeah what a free roof<br>that's right it Richard how do you<br>measure your customer satisfaction how<br>to how do you how do you equate what<br>you're delivering to what the<br>expectation it's very hard because um<br>may I think guest question is a waste of<br>time because the gears will walk I've<br>never pulled one out I'm not going to<br>help another hotel chain anyway but but<br>the tripadvisor is amazing amazing<br>system and they expect really determines<br>that really determines and and and and<br>that is the most powerful system in the<br>world and it's so simple so how do you<br>monitor or did you have people<br>monitoring your social media well we my<br>my son's the VP up for IT and we have a<br>system which we and tripadvisor's not<br>the only system and then has been<br>explained it's too complicated for me<br>but but we avoid people to do that we<br>have a software system which will pick<br>up all the comments about our hotels on<br>all these social media yep and then feed<br>it back in and then there's another<br>company who'll take all that for us and<br>analyzing of ratings and them and that's<br>how we judge the hotels so that is also<br>very easy and you get a report on your<br>desk every time I wish I did but mostly<br>I I asked for what I'm gonna pray often<br>but my my team are doing that all the<br>time and and and the good managers let's<br>pick it up and and you know tripadvisor<br>is amazing system because because we get<br>lots of complaints also but if you<br>answer the complaint properly the actual<br>tripadvisor will reevaluate your score<br>and so you actually neutralize the<br>complaint and that's the whole thing in<br>life if you fix things which aren't<br>working that's what people remember it's<br>a look at your ram the latest hotel<br>offering this is your right<br>ceased<br>yes<br>these hotels fresh and exciting a new<br>Zest hotels are now a reality quilted to<br>meet the strong market demise of today's<br>mobile and budget conscious business<br>traveler zest hotels are opening in<br>major city centers traffic hubs in<br>modern minimalistic and uniquely<br>straightforward a comfort and function<br>zest is a built from the ground up<br>international hotel product and the<br>rising star in a very successful<br>simply the days to you I love the idea<br>of all-inclusive pricing because nothing<br>irritates me more than checking out when<br>somebody wants to charge me eight<br>dollars for the Wi-Fi or something like<br>that so so clearly you've gone and<br>understood Marco denied you've developed<br>it what would that one of the drivers<br>behind where you saw an opportunity<br>fizzies well see.well swiss-belhotel<br>we're we're a hotel brand but we um I<br>tell people your fields will spell I<br>tell you won't see it and when you get<br>to the Hilton's and the shangri-la's<br>they're all very similar so that's how<br>that was one of my business niches to<br>get with developers who want to build<br>their hotel then we saw the market for<br>the same mean square meter room<br>twenty-five dollars a night business and<br>that is that is really moving fast so we<br>designed zest hotels and color<br>everything you cannot change anything<br>it's just all cookie cutter and you know<br>things like the word zest we I spent<br>three months trying to work have a hotel<br>group name I can work out how to do it<br>so either in ourselves a magnum fear<br>with my staff so I i said i'll give you<br>a free trip to australia if someone<br>comes up with a name some guy came up<br>with a name zest so if name cost me two<br>thousand dollars and that's and we just<br>built up from their opening we having<br>our first one last last week and just<br>outside bogor outside in jakarta and<br>we're gonna even 15 and indonesia and<br>then where I'm middle this year I'm<br>sitting up a team but looking Australia<br>and China and New Zealand hopefully and<br>they were really want to up to a hundred<br>hotels are there any more gaps of the<br>market that you see what do you think<br>you're just about Phil the ball by now<br>there's always there's always gaps<br>there's always competition as because<br>people change but you know the budget<br>businesses coming back if you remember<br>20 years ago budget airlines or went<br>bankrupt now budget airlines are taking<br>off so so there's always there's always<br>some opportunities and bad semadar<br>obviously of keeping pace with the<br>customer and understanding that you know<br>those value problems it's not a change<br>CC and see all the young students these<br>days or young people they prefer to<br>spend $25 on an international<br>comfortable hotel they don't want big<br>rooms and they prefer to spend fifty<br>dollars on a bottle of wine and having a<br>good meal or even more than that<br>sometimes so so they've a different<br>value and help you when your eyes are<br>closed you don't know how big the<br>Rimmer's do you when you're sleeping all<br>right I want to move now just to to<br>start to wrap up at about seven-thirty<br>about 15 minutes we'll we'll turn the<br>questions over to to the audience I want<br>to move down to your to your<br>agricultural interest because there's<br>really two parts to you is that there's<br>the there's the hotel operation but<br>there's also your significant footprint<br>in agriculture and I want to just play<br>this next video which will look at this<br>1150 cow year-round milking operation on<br>371 hectares of tikka Danny just inland<br>from way through was described by the<br>award judges as a strong example of<br>dairying and what can be achieved<br>currently the farm comprises a 282<br>hectare milking platform and for nearby<br>runoffs totalling 89 hectares contour is<br>flat with some easy cycling's targeted<br>production this season is 540 thousand<br>kilograms of milk solids Gavin fall took<br>over management of this property's<br>original clock the four th<br>dear family farm in 1990 although his<br>adult life and work has never seen him<br>working the property the farm clearly<br>represents a heritage important to him<br>and an industry and region is hugely<br>committed to there have been falls on<br>this land since 1867 the business has<br>grown under Gavin and continues to do so<br>explains one of his three sons Oliver an<br>auckland-based accountant for extensive<br>family interests it is part of the fall<br>family in always will visas Oliver of<br>the land right from the start he had the<br>vision to create an economically and<br>environmentally sustainable business out<br>of it rather than just a small farm Tony<br>and loi pin warden began sheer milk in<br>here with 540 cows in 2004 now they put<br>850 spring carbon cows and 300 autumn<br>carbon cars through the high-tech 16<br>Bale rotary shed with their team of four<br>full-time staff and six permanent<br>part-timers the shared has added extras<br>like a viewing platform a reception room<br>and bathroom facilities the old cows yet<br>has been converted into an automatic car<br>free ring complex with<br>computer-controlled feeding system the<br>original fall homestead has only the<br>chimney remaining that the area<br>including the stand of large crudity<br>trees is a focus for the fall family<br>they have a tradition of marking<br>significant family events like births or<br>marriages by gathering together to plant<br>kaori amongst the food eating judges<br>comments to businesses combining<br>effectively to service aspirations of<br>both happy working environment for staff<br>successful use of new technology and<br>implementation of excellent systems<br>significant contribution to community by<br>all partners excellent progress on<br>planting back to my long-term management<br>plan and that was the video from your<br>awards last year as the balance supreme<br>award when I understand that this year's<br>awards are on tonight to know<br>they have to pass over your your trophy<br>but it's it's a huge operation 371<br>hectares of land in walking thirteen<br>hundred cows 2.4 million dollar<br>state-of-the-art a super huge complex<br>which I understand even has its own<br>viewing theatre as part of it as well<br>too I wondered how you feeling about the<br>nine point six percent fall of the whole<br>milk powder price over the last 24 hours<br>well then that that move was made of dat<br>dollars of kg and now it's 450 yeah so<br>it's yeah so it's worth that but that's<br>the roller coaster life of dairy farming<br>um no it's not good at the moment but<br>yeah tell us a bit more about the<br>association with the the D receptor<br>obviously it's been a long among<br>brothers and I we all grew up and on the<br>dairy farm we didn't actually far but<br>because my father was a foursquare<br>grocer so it actually is a family thing<br>and and as it says you know we have 5th<br>or 6th generation now and it belongs to<br>all of us doesn't matter who owns it<br>would be quite honest as actually my<br>beings in but so does matter who owns it<br>as part of you know like like like the<br>lane no one owns the ranges you just got<br>the rite of passage while you're alive<br>and so the thing is that bring them to<br>sustainable operation and it was only a<br>hundred acres and that this is where<br>it's been the other week of when I came<br>back home for that week from hong kong I<br>start thinking about a dairy business<br>and my parents said you can never sell a<br>family farm so anything the deals are<br>trying to make a work will make it<br>sustainable so that's how we started and<br>you know as it says that we use itself<br>sort of the focus of our family all my<br>brothers my four brothers will sell<br>focus I wonder what your thoughts are<br>more generally on on the dairy sector at<br>the moment and particularly given your<br>wide and varied association with<br>Asia the growing opportunities obviously<br>that China presents fit for the D<br>receptor while also ensuring that you<br>know we manage that growth appropriately<br>as somebody with a very large stake in<br>this in this business well what are you<br>thinking it will macro level about where<br>that sector is sitting at the moment<br>well my thing he's dollar all occurs<br>through also because then you know we've<br>had fun tours had their challenges and<br>and which is any business has the<br>challenges you know it's how you handle<br>your challenges the features is<br>unbelievable because it is this such a<br>huge food requirement in China and India<br>and and they need and milk is probably<br>the most flexible product food product<br>in the world so if it doesn't work is<br>because we're not handling it right so I<br>have no no worries or hesitation about<br>about the investment and the business<br>you just have to make it work Fonterra<br>has long talked about though how it<br>needs to move itself up the value chain<br>we still export everything in a form of<br>milk powder and it's all been about<br>supposedly finding these opportunities<br>in the future do you think that we're<br>proving or fonterra is moving quickly<br>enough familiar that's a tricky question<br>I did think we're never moving fast<br>enough and Fonterra is so big now that<br>actually is having challenges to to to<br>handle itself I am management as a huge<br>challenge and and I don't think we're<br>moving up the value chain at all at the<br>speed we should be we're still 75<br>percent of our exports of milk powder<br>and and if you don't value add it's like<br>any business if this university doesn't<br>start very rating which is well as<br>dominguez walls business schools it<br>can't stay alive if it just teaches the<br>same basic things that 30 or 40 years<br>ago so we have to evaluate and and I<br>think we one of the thing you know<br>museum has the most amazing products<br>amazing Airlines amazing tourism<br>business we're sometimes a little bit<br>we come really marketing low we should<br>what about that that process who drives<br>that process I mean the farmer<br>shareholders obviously are the ones that<br>you know as a co-op owned owned the<br>business is is there enough of a drive<br>from that I mean if they apply the sort<br>of drive that you've applied to your<br>hotel business fonterra would presume to<br>be a very different organization today<br>I'm not sure I the farm was feeling a<br>little isolated because we're just a<br>production unit and we just hope and<br>pray that we get the right price we're<br>now standing on auction system so we're<br>going to the roller coaster so like<br>hotel rooms are selling milk now on the<br>internet and we've still got a lot to<br>learn there we're not very wedding like<br>we should and and and it's very hard for<br>for a production firm to also be a<br>marketing firm I think we I think they<br>developing opportunities but not fast<br>enough I mean you have to look at near<br>Slater start with a great marketing<br>company and it's all it is market and in<br>value add and that's what we should do<br>so we've concentrated too much on<br>production and not enough on the<br>customer it's what I wrap up and<br>conclude with a few sort of quickfire<br>questions to to conclude in your bio<br>notes you say that you are concerned by<br>the huge depreciation of new zealand's<br>relative wealth compared to our Asian<br>neighbors how do you believe we should<br>be addressing that issue if I knew it'd<br>and I saw John Key this morning and I<br>feels amazing I was actually amazed the<br>way that he's performing at the moment I<br>know I didn't I didn't wealth is a funny<br>thing you can't judge by dollars as<br>always but you know we were global<br>economy in the world does not it's not a<br>level playing field and so it's a big<br>question but you know I I have a home<br>loan and Hong Kong and of a home that<br>load in New Zealand and the hong kong i<br>pay one percent and it needs young my<br>page six so immediately there's a and<br>the capital growth in hong kong is as<br>amazing although you know Oakland is<br>also but crazy hong kong's become opens<br>become like Hong Kong but probably<br>prizes going over twenty-five percent a<br>year which I say which also actually<br>depreciate your wealth because any paper<br>money in terms of the political<br>landscape at the moment if somebody with<br>a long association with politics in this<br>country how do you give obviously a just<br>say you're impressed with job key but<br>what else you making of the political<br>landscape of the moment everybody's so<br>happy here I mean everyone so satisfied<br>and enter and I've never seen a<br>political environment with his no<br>distinction asked me a lot of time with<br>Australia obviously and then manisha and<br>Middle East and there's total dissension<br>every I just this is just a unique<br>situation and um and I think you know<br>it's and this is most stable country in<br>the world at the moment so so<br>politically we see you again in the<br>right direction now are we developing<br>our depth I'm not sure is that<br>population growing fast enough<br>definitely not you know the age group<br>looking around the rim here will<br>you know it's the age of average dairy<br>farm when I was 58 years old was too old<br>this is not the young people driving<br>through the system and that's what<br>drives the future I mean China is<br>nothing special they are amazing but you<br>know in sixty-five percent of the people<br>are under 30 the powerhouse is just<br>there with us having kids or eating we<br>talked out before the stay here we<br>talked about before the start of this<br>this idea of the war for talent that's<br>around the moment are we doing enough to<br>to retain and cultivate our times in<br>this country well talent is no global<br>and and we said I was told to someone<br>earlier tonight when when when you think<br>of someone like Claudia baton amazing<br>person and she said she just had to get<br>out of New Zealand to do what you wanted<br>to do how do we bring these people back<br>you can't really bring them back but how<br>can we bring them back into the system I<br>love flying so I'm over-seasoned live in<br>New Zealand so i think i'm bringing two<br>systems together how do we make how do<br>we get things to be global I think we we<br>can get people living in New Zealand and<br>work in the world and it's something<br>unique you know we've classified as the<br>best country in the world of the living<br>right by all surveys so somehow we're to<br>bring that sense and you know and then<br>flying the Hong Kong 14 hours there's<br>nothing because these take me 10 hours<br>you go by rail car from you promote the<br>Wellington to go to university so it's<br>all and most people in this room see<br>more time traveling than I do because<br>I can sit with a Chardonnay in it just<br>it just finally to wrap up if you know<br>those that are here starting out and<br>starting out on their career journey<br>what's the what's the most important<br>lesson that you learned in your long and<br>extensive time and business what are you<br>reflect on is that as the essence of of<br>what everybody said it off on your<br>journey should should be realizing we're<br>thinking them well success only comes<br>from hard work and there's key don't<br>listen the negative people never seek<br>advice from somebody who's not<br>successful all right in their own<br>business and and just believe from what<br>you're doing be prepared to lose money<br>make mistakes fall over but always get<br>up in that and go and it's not it is<br>difficult it's never impossible there's<br>one final anecdote I have to share your<br>favorite hotel is the pen it's your<br>hotel at Hong Kong which we've talked<br>about where you worked at but you've<br>never actually stayed there so you see<br>yes more than 35 bucks a night years so<br>second so you'll stick to that I'll say<br>that one day I'm saving up ladies little</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
