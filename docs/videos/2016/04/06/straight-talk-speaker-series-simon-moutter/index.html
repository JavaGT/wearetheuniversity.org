0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>please join me in extending saima muta a<br>very warm welcome behalf of University<br>welcome business school okay you start<br>up a 10 Simon we've entitled this<br>conversation with leadership in the<br>digital age what's different about the<br>kind of leadership that's required in a<br>digital age compared to the industrial<br>age well look I you know it isn't it's a<br>great place to start the conversation<br>because certainly in my first roles and<br>management which were beckons of<br>nineteen late 1980s while we thought we<br>had a digital age going on Lee and it is<br>nothing by comparison to what it is<br>today and so I could you know I could<br>genuinely believe that I've sort of seen<br>through you know seeing what it's like<br>and both in both senses and look you<br>know I would I would say the digital age<br>you know primarily characterized by the<br>pace of change and i think that is if is<br>if these one single thought that says<br>it's different it's different because<br>everything moves on so quickly and so<br>unexpectedly so the way you have to<br>think about leading the way you have to<br>cover options the way you have to plan<br>for change even when it seems like<br>you're on a positive really positive<br>track the end of the positive track can<br>come very very quickly so i think pace<br>of change is the first major difference<br>I think the way people communicate today<br>in a sort of very immediate way the 24-7<br>connectivity the way they connect<br>together and incredibly blue the<br>boundaries between work and their home<br>lives is also dramatically different so<br>you know even 10 years ago work was work<br>at home was home and you know even if<br>you had a work phone you weren't allowed<br>to use it to make calls dammam right<br>today everything is so intertwined and<br>say<br>you know you you're the people you're<br>leading don't disassociate the two parts<br>of their lives and the way they do and<br>then that creates quite you know big new<br>challenges for how you get your head<br>around motivating and leading people<br>because they're not just listening to<br>the work story what is what so<br>refreshing that we're doing this the<br>old-fashioned way yes to face me again<br>look at it would come out dry so that's<br>so let's go way way back to the 60s<br>mm-hmm 50 years ago and you could tell<br>me about the experience of growing up in<br>New Zealand in the sixties and in the<br>70s and how do you think that experience<br>shapes your own leadership philosophy<br>yeah yeah look I think I do when I think<br>about you know what made me who I am I<br>would most often start from there right<br>you know I grew up in the in the the<br>blue-collar suburbs of palmerston north<br>which is you know a pretty inspiring<br>place yeah but it was when I reflect on<br>it you know I very hard-working parents<br>who you know that very blue-collar<br>strove you know they strove every day<br>for a better life they they wanted they<br>wanted better for their children than<br>they had and that stuff rubs off on some<br>of us not all of us in my family are the<br>same as me but you know on some of us<br>and and in inside you know I think about<br>that and often as you know what what<br>made me who I am and I think in<br>particular in my mother a very<br>determined woman very almost sort of<br>pioneering type woman of the of the 60s<br>who could do anything make anything if<br>you couldn't afford the clothes you made<br>them a few you couldn't afford to cover<br>the couch you know you sort you did it<br>yourself so a very forceful am extremely<br>determined and would have a better life<br>even if the bank account wasn't gonna<br>support it and so that that rubbed off a<br>lot of men I think also the opportunity<br>I would<br>today at the time I didn't quite think<br>of her that way to go to some of the<br>toughest schools in New Zealand you know<br>Mon red intermediate would you know<br>wouldn't rank high on the decile or sort<br>of you know great places to be stakes as<br>a tough school in a very tough subbu but<br>it but it did it does you know those<br>things shape you to make you resilient<br>they help you to deal learn to deal with<br>people from every spectrum of society<br>and I still carry that that with me I<br>can I can engage with the you know the<br>you know all types of employees in a way<br>that will fit with them and in a<br>language that will work for human so<br>that is not achieved to sort of make<br>connections which i think is much more<br>difficult if you haven't had the<br>opportunity in your life for four years<br>to experience you know that wider set of<br>of people so those are that those are<br>things I think you know for me it sort<br>of made me into a very determined person<br>and you know I'll get my mind set on an<br>outcome on reasonably difficult to<br>dissuade from the possibility once the<br>mind is set and and it sort of shapes my<br>leadership style is to be aiming for<br>something pretty big from from the<br>get-go not not to sort of me n door<br>along but actually to aspire to<br>something pretty bold from the outset<br>and into you know to get after it but<br>not an array are sort of a seats but in<br>a very let's do this first of Mexican in<br>this next you know in in a very shaping<br>committed fashion to get an outcome<br>which you know that's how it was so in<br>terms of the school context I mean did<br>you if notes there as a leader with your<br>selected or did<br>kind of a virtual you look I you know<br>I'm one of those kids that I you know I<br>can't remember not either the in church<br>to be honest it didn't matter if it was<br>school at home the scouts the<br>neighborhood wherever I was I would have<br>tended to take over my mother had that<br>tendency to see think I know where I got<br>it and yeah so I've always always been<br>in the front and I you know I can't<br>remember anything different actually in<br>in meter always up for taking the<br>challenge trying to you know try to get<br>something achieved in to win right a<br>very competitive spirit always always<br>wanted to to make sure my team won<br>whatever it was one magnet up in years<br>so in terms of going back to our opening<br>point about the digital age if you think<br>about what it's like to grow up in the<br>first part of the toilet sort of<br>entering particularly how you think the<br>experience of you're like working and<br>growing under the digital age will<br>influence the leadership followers of<br>future museum under certain look I think<br>it's some i watch it today and I I think<br>most of the Edam because I have my way<br>of seeing the world you know you always<br>of course be very judgmental about the<br> to people's view of the world but<br>I would worry that leadership today and<br>for the four young delete is coming<br>through that outcomes the focus on<br>outcomes seems very short too so the<br>pace we you know what good looks like is<br>always a very short term horizon and it<br>can it seems to me sometimes to be about<br>creating a success which is in a moment<br>in time in and there's an acceptance<br>that light will move on and what seeing<br>you know that they could be created in<br>two years time might not last five years<br>but that sort of doesn't matter because<br>it was there was you know we gotta win<br>on the journey and whatever comes<br>it'll be next I I think it's so that's<br>one of the challenges is to is to really<br>create heavy leaders focus on creating a<br>long-term sustainable value because and<br>it's not just the how they think it's<br>the way in business markets reward<br>success to which can be also very short<br>to Manuel see that around the world<br>today I didn't know you know there's<br>always a sort of view that markets are<br>the perfect predictors but of course<br>they never do predict actually how fast<br>business has changed you know<br>blackberries the example of the week<br>right blackberry was the world number<br>one and business mobile you know all of<br>its investors valued at an enormous<br>price they didn't collectively see that<br>it was going to take over the ensuing<br>few years but the pez team so markets<br>reward short-term outcomes too and so<br>this is a bit of a self-fulfilling<br>problem link which i think is an issue<br>for for future leaders and and i will<br>say i think a lot about the way they how<br>i watch upcoming leaders are tend to be<br>overly digital i think actually people<br>still like to be led by a person who<br>fronts up to them who talks to them who<br>just makes it clear what they what good<br>looks like and what you know what will i<br>be rewarded for and punished by and i<br>think / / committing to social networks<br>and me as means of communication and<br>being a piece and actually puts sort of<br>an unusual barrier between you and<br>people actually I'm not sure that's the<br>right approach so you know I think this<br>is some challenges these also some<br>interesting opportunities in you know<br>opportunities they don't you know we<br>didn't have which is really about you<br>know being able to make a big mark very<br>quickly and you know in a world where<br>everything is so visible if you've got<br>the right if you're onto a winner or it<br>can be a big winner very quickly there<br>so thinking about some of your<br>employer's do<br>have that drive wanting the big winner<br>what you find you have to kind of temper<br>their expectations how would you manage<br>that in terms of sense the drive and<br>ambition bit to say all this is not a<br>lot of sprint it's a marathon yeah I<br>meta some I you know it's the art of<br>setting the sort of write objectives in<br>making it clear what what good really<br>looks like and in a businesslike<br>telecoms which is still while while the<br>front other services change very<br>dramatically it's still a huge<br>infrastructure enabled business we still<br>spend a half a billion a year on that on<br>ket in capital and and you're still<br>creating value that has to endure on the<br>back of it so it's really is about sort<br>of mating the right targets with the<br>right people and and you know there's<br>nothing wrong with short to positive<br>outcomes but you know as long as they<br>are moving on in creating long-term<br>value as well and so it's just it's just<br>about making sure everyone understands<br>what it looks like what you'll be<br>rewarded for what another tank might be<br>to give them the same performative<br>leadership development experience that<br>you had in your early 20 so your first<br>management position was running harvest<br>and world's largest fish and chip shop<br>while you're studying for your<br>engineering degree yo what did you learn<br>from that experience that's still<br>important for you today yeah as you move<br>into work into the cor one thing I<br>learned is the smell of fish I still you<br>know I still find difficulty fish and<br>chips after doing that you know so I was<br>that I was the longest-serving employee<br>and in of the of what was a fish and<br>chip shop called captain delicious it's<br>a mirage yeah yeah I'm sorry about<br>pushing sure not sure if they're still<br>going but but I you know I saw it<br>through three managers in ended up<br>my last year at Massey is you know the<br>most experienced employee in this<br>business so we in the boss went on<br>holiday I ran the shop he had he had an<br>office later who did the you know paid<br>the bills and things but I ran in the<br>store which was a bit weird and boy they<br>taught you what sort of hard workers in<br>how little you know how little money you<br>could in for working so many hours that<br>was a so that was an inspiration I'm not<br>doing this for the rest of my body and<br>and but you know again it was the fact<br>that he would ask me to do that was a<br>confidence-building you know you<br>actually they did you know I had his<br>trust I can I could manage that and in a<br>cool side you know took that<br>responsibility seriously it was his<br>livelihood in his his company in there<br>so you know that was a an honor and but<br>you know just built over years a sense<br>of confidence that I could do that sort<br>of thing doesn't have you been boat risk<br>I go back to car me occasionally my<br>parents are still there so and and I do<br>occasionally physically the the owner of<br>that store to have kept in touch tovar<br>the years yeah yeah but i don't think<br>the job still here so i think it's going<br>there and you've described yourself as a<br>directional leader who was occasionally<br>directive and can you explain what you<br>mean by this and i look I think there<br>are a lot of different types of leaders<br>are not in and in leaders enable<br>business outcomes and release their<br>organization potential in different ways<br>and for me that is mostly you know seats<br>you know building a very clear direction<br>for an organization and you know I will<br>put a lot of work into the first year<br>and any an any big job to source to<br>chart a course really to reseat strategy<br>for whatever it is we're trying to<br>achieve that is cut you know usually<br>are pretty bold view an inspiration for<br>the future end and do a lot of you know<br>the work that's you know and lead the<br>work because a lot of people have have a<br>role in there but to to figure out what<br>the future could be what the strategy<br>that would you know unlock that value<br>and those outcomes might be what you<br>know what they're for you had to do in<br>terms of planning and capability in<br>performance to enable that possibility<br>and so sitting that direction and<br>powering up an organization to deliver<br>is the way I would start any journey so<br>I'm less inclined to be out in front of<br>the people you know doing the sort of<br>human leadership stuff until I've got a<br>very clear story so I'll lead off the<br>back of what I think is a positive thing<br>to be part of and you know if I relate a<br>few examples for that you know when I<br>when I was in the power industry I<br>inherited I was the CEO at one of the<br>smaller power companies in New Zealand<br>we chatted the course to make it into<br>one of the biggest over seven years and<br>we did that through M&amp;A seven<br>transactions and weed from number 26 and<br>New Zealand to number four in the<br>industry and that was a powerful story<br>that no you know it went when we set it<br>out right from the start was everyone in<br>the company wanted to be part of that<br>story so it was easy then to lead and<br>practical seeds of how to you know how<br>to how to motivate that same you know<br>auckland airport was similarly a story<br>you know a change in aspiration about<br>the growth of that business could<br>achieve it was latent potential in that<br>company i fought end and you know<br>sitting up a directional shift there was<br>that that was the inspiration for the<br>key people be bought in to be part of it<br>not my style or you know there were<br>other ways of working so that's that's<br>what I think about as a directional it<br>should be really clear but it not just<br>an aspiration I really formed strategy<br>any<br>tional plane to deliver its that's what<br>i would call directional leadership and<br>in boy i can be a pain in the ass of<br>driving to there and i will move up and<br>down the the layers and can be very<br>directive sometimes an hour i'll leave<br>room for people to be empowered within<br>boundaries but you know you know one of<br>my philosophies and i stole this line i<br>can't remember we're from the true<br>empowerment requires forceful leadership<br>as a very strong people want to be<br>empowered but within very tight and<br>clear boundaries actually and with a<br>very clear expression about what success<br>looks like in what what it is that they<br>used to do so i will team to go up and<br>down the layers of an organization and<br>be in can be quite bossy actually about<br>what has to be done and how it has to be<br>done and i'll do that especially in the<br>trouble of business or or a highly<br>stressed business in telecom it's like<br>that right now where it is a highly<br>stressed business been on the 10-year<br>losing streak and turning it round takes<br>a very strong directional lead and a<br>huge amount of directive action to<br>motivate and unlock the potential of the<br>organization to respond that is that is<br>the position we're in today and I don't<br>think when you're taking on a really big<br>challenge you can't tap dance around the<br>issues you've got to be pretty clear and<br>and I guess as long as you match that<br>with a willingness to you know watch as<br>is the journey plays out and if you've<br>got it wrong to adjust adjust the<br>directional course quickly if you find<br>yourself blind dallying or or<br>something's not working and again i'm a<br>pretty unemotional guy around later you<br>know it's just a business decision of it<br>and if it was mine i don't care if it<br>turned out to be wrong or fix it in you<br>know hold the people my people to that<br>too and i'll help them be unemotional<br>sometimes if they<br>great way of describing essentially cuz<br>you're getting back to the original<br>genetic roots to leadership is the<br>leader which is someone who pointed the<br>way of film and the way it works pretty<br>well within a lot of different companies<br>but broadly in the infrastructure<br>industry the extent to which you think<br>that directive and directional for<br>militia was particularly critical to<br>talk a bit about that in terms of here<br>you've got a particular context yeah<br>look I've them I've I'm an engineer so I<br>teat of you know Tina's will i know i<br>have instincts for businesses what you<br>build around infrastructure or<br>technology or you know that's it's it's<br>my thing so I've tended to stay close to<br>that type of business and over yep you<br>know having spent you know all my career<br>in it you do over time develop the<br>judgment and instincts to you know with<br>some confidence being able to be able to<br>direct activity to get the right outcome<br>and so and and I think in in<br>particularly in infrastructure<br>industries there are some secrets you<br>know they're not they're not really<br>secrets but there are some principles<br>actually about how you add a lot of<br>value for them because they tend to hear<br>very I fixed cost structures in<br>relatively low short-run marginal costs<br>compared to long run costs and say the<br>way you create value and operate them is<br>a bit mathematical end and a few if you<br>allow a few people get off track with<br>that and start operating on like a<br>variable cost business on destroy value<br>very very quickly and say so you know I<br>tend to be reasonably firm around what<br>you know what are the dynamics for<br>running running a business you know<br>really and make sure everyone<br>understands the value drivers and how to<br>how to how to pull the levers that that<br>will extract the most value and<br>sometimes it is a very directive process<br>particularly around marketing people of<br>you<br>yeah and so you work the barricade no<br>time but you know sometimes he's a<br>reasonably firm hand required to make<br>sure that that way the way the<br>businesses is promoted and sold the way<br>product has done is managed in a way<br>that's going to create long-term value<br>because its most of the cost is below<br>the line and if you get to hang up on on<br>incremental margins you can destroy an<br>awful lot along to medium and the<br>process yeah after nine years you left<br>telecom as take on the role of CEO of<br>auckland international airport and<br>that's quite a different leisure<br>challenge all we're still within the<br>infrastructure of business so it's what<br>extent you think that experience is<br>helping tackle the top job at telecom<br>and my senses that doesn't happen enough<br>moving out into different organizations<br>and coming back and do you think more<br>executive should move in and out of<br>organizations yeah look I and I i left i<br>left telecom after nine years because i<br>thought i was part of the problem and<br>you know i was Teresa's right hand I did<br>run the New Zealand business and we did<br>get into you know we didn't do a great<br>job in terms of customer perceptions and<br>and got off side with the government so<br>I thought well look actually the right<br>thing for me to do was to hop out of<br>there and lead a new face you know that<br>someone new take over and not have<br>mediate become that guy's is I know we<br>already tried that and you know he was<br>all seen one of those and so I didn't<br>want to be that guy so I I I licked and<br>I thought the young the opportunity<br>airport was a was a good fit with their<br>with you know my skills and capabilities<br>and in look the the airport job turned<br>into a fury injury because I I'd we<br>clear thinking it was an infrastructure<br>business and and you know it clearly<br>always had been and that's the way those<br>companies are for<br>around the world we know they lay<br>concrete and build build buildings and<br>you know that's that's the mission and<br>but you know that was already in pretty<br>good shape so I didn't I couldn't see<br>how much you know how to add much fairly<br>there but actually dawned on us that it<br>was a really could be in the New Zealand<br>context because welcome evil is such a<br>big company what airports wouldn't<br>normally be so big in the scale of the<br>national business environment as Oakland<br>Airport is now the third biggest listed<br>company in New Zealand it was a very big<br>business in a very thinly capitalized<br>and fragmented tourism industry we<br>decided you know that actually maybe it<br>was a prospect of the airport company<br>being the leader and tourism in and<br>taking a stance of trying to drive our<br>growth for New Zealand terms of<br>visitation and so it was a big big cool<br>it was a strategy that most most<br>observers particularly the the stock<br>market observers thought it was not so<br>you know they didn't he the most common<br>result when we set out a plan to shift<br>from being an engineering business to<br>being a sales growth engine you know we<br>shut down you know outsource all the<br>engineering to all that resource and put<br>a sales team together who got on<br>aeroplanes and went around and tried to<br>sell new zealand as a destination to<br>other two airlines and in Asia<br>predominantly and then you know we<br>bought stakes and some other airports to<br>try to beef up the scale of the offer<br>that that strategy was you know really<br>at the time we launched the stock market<br>of people who followed our stock thought<br>it was silly and and it wouldn't work<br>and you know no air ports airports don't<br>do that actually what they weren't<br>getting was how significant Auckland<br>Airport was in the New Zealand context<br>it is true that an equal<br>you know in other countries isn't<br>necessarily such a big player and so<br>that strategy was a very successful<br>strategy and and the tea another great<br>team we build at the airport did execute<br>incredibly well on it and and you know<br>you can see the benefit in the to the<br>business but also to the country and<br>that and the performance of Albany<br>Airport over the last few years and the<br>shareholders have had a doubling of<br>their share price in that in that<br>four-year period as well so it's been a<br>good outcome and see what was the<br>learning actually you know be confident<br>if if you're on a plan you know you know<br>you have to be quite resilient in the<br>face of an investor base who sort of by<br>definition are there because they like<br>what's already there they might moan<br>about it but they haven't sold so sort<br>of in a way if they're invested in the<br>company there must be something they<br>really like about it so when you tune up<br>and say I'm going to toss that light out<br>and go a different path they're more<br>resistive than you might expect actually<br>and so and so I think that is for me<br>it's you know having the confidence<br>holding the line in in the face of quite<br>a lot of flak and in quite direct you<br>know we mean if I'm wrong here this is<br>great you know as though ways to hide ya<br>you know I know we have we get this<br>report done we participated in these<br>sort of reports of x and sell-side<br>analysts who compared the sort of<br>hundred bigger companies in Australasia<br>and I slid right to the bottom of the<br>CEO rankings and then you know when you<br>open the book and you've gone right from<br>you know just to the book you've gone<br>out the bottom you know you've whom<br>should I keep going here or not there is<br>actually you do hit the brace yourself<br>and push on so I've come back to telecom<br>more comfort<br>and more willing to head down a path and<br>you know take the flack if we're going<br>to take some flack but the two lead to 2<br>minus out getting an outcome it was a<br>helpful to get some distance because I<br>was thinking about you know you're very<br>directive presumably before you approach<br>to take Iran you must have a sort of<br>strategy formulating was it getting some<br>distance we were able to see the company<br>in the recognizing the copier transform<br>significantly you ought to see it a<br>different line find a different way for<br>yeah I you know on going back to telecom<br>which I do I take your point is unusual<br>to go back I people have gone back to<br>the same industry who doesn't usually go<br>back from one senior role to another<br>senior role in the same company and I<br>think and when I reflect on that it had<br>some there was some hazards in there too<br>because I was at risk of going back with<br>it's just the same business I left four<br>years ago so I you know I had to be very<br>disciplined actually about listening to<br>the organization and so I did for the<br>first few months I didn't write I tried<br>not to do too many things but you know<br>there was a I did I did cross the line a<br>few times but I did I was very conscious<br>about listening to the organization for<br>the first and three or four months and<br>and to customers and into the<br>stakeholders to make sure I had a<br>bearing on what it was and how it was<br>different from when I left a few years<br>earlier and there was an unusual mix<br>actually so you know the staff thought<br>it was more different than I then it<br>appeared to me actually end and it just<br>shows how time and changes a face can<br>you know people think it's been renewed<br>but it wasn't it wasn't you know it<br>wasn't as renewed as they thought and<br>you know one simple example would be the<br>people of senior leaders thought it was<br>a much smaller organized<br>in terms of people numbers because they<br>have restructured it several times in<br>there for years and that seemed a lot of<br>people leave but they were when I start<br>to look at the numbers are convinced<br>they don't seem any different so I<br>initially thought well they must be true<br>but they didn't see much too often and<br>different and sure enough having gone<br>back and I got the finance team to go<br>and actually pull the numbers out and<br>the organization was you know literally<br>only two or three hundred people less<br>than it was four years earlier because<br>despite the fact that you know a lot of<br>people had been made redundant and most<br>being restructured in that period of<br>time they needed them back in between so<br>so it wasn't as different as people<br>forward in some ways so would you<br>recommend it to other companies and<br>executives too and I've seen the phrase<br>boomeranging boy where you essentially<br>say look I think it really important as<br>he developed to get some different<br>experience and deleon back you think<br>there's opportunity but I think their<br>works and in particular brain for people<br>who've been if you've if you've grown up<br>in one business if you've come from the<br>rinks and you know over 15 or 20 years<br>you've risen to it quite a senior<br>leadership role I think it's almost an<br>imperative to go somewhere else you know<br>one or two places and in and just see<br>actually that there isn't just one way<br>to do things so that you know I've been<br>in several industries and several roles<br>and that it does make you a better<br>leader and a more round miniature<br>there's no doubt about that so I so but<br>if you if you've already got better in<br>your career in your eyes if you know<br>that's fine better but so if you've had<br>a varied path to leadership you know<br>you've already got it but if you've come<br>through one company it is I think quite<br>an important fair enough you know taking<br>a steeper and the challenge there is<br>sometimes you have to go down a level to<br>get out and it's when you you know and i<br>watch i watch really good capable<br>leaders who've reported to me or be one<br>or two her down<br>years rise to a ring with our<br>vocationally very expert you know very<br>very caffeine so they paid a lot because<br>of that strength and they desperately<br>want to be more than that or switch and<br>they're not willing to drop a level<br>including drop and pay packet to move<br>and they trek they get trapped in a way<br>by their own success in that area and<br>I'm willing to confront it and I think<br>there's a point where if you do want to<br>generalize you have to be prepared to do<br>that and I've done that twice in my<br>career where I moved to a different role<br>for Less pay to shift industry or to<br>learn new things and say there is that<br>you know at the time so brave move yep<br>and you're also investing in your<br>revolution yep development let's talk<br>about moving into the back to telecom<br>and you you've suggested a telecom has<br>moved into cleared hair which is free of<br>past concern regarding regulation and<br>you've also said it would take quote 324<br>concerted years of precise consistent<br>execution to turn the company around<br>them so what are you doing the CEO to<br>reposition telecom so that it thinks and<br>operates differently in this new<br>environment well it is you know telecom<br>has gone through this sort of profound<br>change actually in you know we knew when<br>you were the first talker in the world<br>to be D merged so to have chorus split<br>off from telecom Missouri you know an<br>incredible structural shift it takes a<br>large and enormously profitable piece of<br>the business of the company so we you<br>know the old telecom group was always<br>you know while you had some variability<br>in your retail piece that variability<br>was less variable because you had the<br>big solid 700 million of either da being<br>cranked off the<br>the copper business every year on a sank<br>acid base at a 75-percent gross margin<br>so it was ever sort of had a smoothing<br>of fit well we don't have that anymore<br>so the new telecom is variable cost pers<br>a much more variable cost it doesn't<br>have anywhere to hide if we get it wrong<br>and our performance and at the same time<br>as that we've had quite a big change in<br>our competitive arena with the emerging<br>of emergence of a food serious player in<br>mobile in na and a combination of our<br>two biggest competitors are Vodafone and<br>Telstra Cleese's a heck of a lot in the<br>air alone let alone the profound change<br>in the industry where so much of the<br>services that we've always been the<br>provider of is now just tuning into a<br>you know an application layer that has<br>provided by over the top operators or<br>what we call an OEM and the makers of<br>devices so you know messaging and voice<br>applications and things are just moving<br>into the internet into the end of the<br>world of software and they don't need a<br>study got these incredible changes<br>occurring end and changing at a very<br>high rate so sort of one of the first<br>mentoring and telecom today so you know<br>we have to change at the same rate of<br>the industry and market is changing if<br>you're going to change slow than the<br>market is changing you're in trouble so<br>you know we have to get keep that rate<br>of change up and we yet we made a very<br>conscious decision between the two the<br>two principal choices of strategy one to<br>be the provider of data pipes which was<br>the civ easiest path that would be akin<br>to a power lines company for example if<br>we we could simplify the business<br>greatly and just provide big fat data<br>pipes or data connectivity be it fixed<br>or mobile you know that would it was a<br>pretty straightforward business option<br>or we had to be a player in digital<br>services<br>in the sort of the cloud application<br>layer that business customers want on<br>the new the new age of digital services<br>of consumers want we we made a decision<br>to go the harder way and we chose the<br>letter on the basis that it's a higher<br>value outcome for customers for the<br>country in for the company if we get it<br>right but it is a much riskier much<br>tougher option to have chosen but New<br>Zealand needs that companies are willing<br>to do that because we just depend on<br>that on the global players to do that<br>and it's you leaned up with a different<br>outcome and and not necessarily as good<br>for the country so we chose we chose<br>we've made our choice is the direction<br>see we've got a plan in place and and we<br>are now doing you know we're making a<br>series of very substantial changes to<br>the organization to the size of it to<br>the way we manage our people to to the<br>investment portfolio and in that context<br>my simple analogy a big business like<br>telecom we have millions of customers we<br>have hundreds of thousands of contracts<br>on foot with customers in suppliers if<br>1700 major IT or network technology<br>platforms we've got six six and a half<br>thousand people it has a huge amount of<br>inertia so if you think about shifting<br>all of that mess which is enduring a<br>contracts on for four years you can't<br>change it in five minutes you you know<br>the only way you move a really big<br>machine like that as you push hard on<br>multiple fronts at once 22 directionally<br>shift it and that's weird years of<br>precise execution coming because if you<br>don't push in unison and you don't push<br>on the right things and you don't have<br>the organization pushing all together<br>you know in a really consider way and<br>you've got you know at least a half a<br>dozen really big change<br>is in the outcomes predictable the<br>outcome will be more of the same so in<br>you know in our business we're right now<br>we we we are focused on what we call the<br>turn around program and it is a way of<br>looking at we've been on you know we're<br>not a we're knotted you know we're not a<br>near bankruptcy by any stretch of the<br>imagination but our company makes one<br>third of the profit that did ten years<br>ago our revenue trends have been in<br>decline for tears our market share<br>trends been in decline for ten years our<br>people engagements been in decline for<br>ten years our stockholders have taken<br>negative you know lowering returns for<br>tears so if all your trends are on that<br>slope the first job is to turn the tree<br>not to worry about where it ends up to<br>actually turn it so that's that's that's<br>the emphasis in the organization right<br>now what have we got to do to tune it<br>and in you know just simple little<br>translations of their say for mobile we<br>need to gain mobile market share<br>position of mobile is to this week and<br>it's principally why the method our<br>business don't we we are overweight in<br>the fixed market and underweight and<br>mobile in the world is moving to mobile<br>so there as our fixed business falls at<br>pretty much the rate it does anywhere<br>else in the world we underperform and we<br>end up with a negative get we're most<br>you know an income and telco usually<br>will have those reasonably imbalance so<br>we have to move our mobile position up<br>in revenue market share but that's just<br>too big an idea to communicate to<br>several thousand people say by thinking<br>about momentum today all you actually<br>have to think you know if you solve the<br>meth right win fifty percent of the<br>action tomorrow so the line and mobilize<br>wouldn't 50 per scene of everything<br>that's going two morrow when it next<br>week wouldn't next month and if we keep<br>on winning it every month the market<br>here will sort itself out so the<br>objective will be achieved and that's<br>what I<br>thinking that you know how you you're<br>pushing organization for every person so<br>they know you know in mobile we know you<br>know what we have to do and they look at<br>today we move the business from monthly<br>in arrears reporting which if you think<br>about I was think about reporting you<br>report at the cycle at which you're<br>willing to intervene and so if you<br>report monthly at least you'll intervene<br>monthly this if you got to make a take<br>action as a manager usually will be low<br>slower the net monthly reporting usually<br>means by the time you're looking at<br>numbers actually it's usually well into<br>the following month and then as soon as<br>you think something's going on the first<br>thing you say as well we did a wait to<br>see another month or two to see if we've<br>got a trend here and so actually your<br>cycle of intervention gets a long way<br>out of what's going on so we've moved<br>retail retail business do daily so they<br>they now have for example all of all of<br>their sales targets every every shop<br>every product line every channel we<br>trade through Israel we have a TV we<br>overnight to report it so it's available<br>to the leadership team at eight thirty<br>in the morning leadership team meets at<br>eight thirty they run over it wherever<br>we're off target we immediately take<br>corrective action that day 22 to get the<br>business back on to win fifty percent of<br>everything that's going today that's<br>that's the main crop sites it's a way of<br>thinking about particularly because we<br>do from the measured at the pace of<br>which within to intervene David yes<br>that's it yeah you have to in retail and<br>it's that's a big shift and so it talks<br>about the monitoring let's talk about<br>incentivization a because I think it's<br>some very interesting things are<br>happening there as far as your your<br>approach to creating meaningful<br>incentives to employees especially in<br>the context of a declining core business<br>it's probably doing this so how's that<br>approach you know what's that approach<br>being in how you had something applied<br>to you<br>yeah we um we at telecom we would have I<br>think what most people would regard as a<br>textbook sort of HR an incentive<br>framework we've had it for a long time<br>and it's sort of where I learned<br>textbook HR because the companies I'd<br>rather before we didn't we didn't have<br>much of that but telecom being a very<br>big business you know his has two of<br>everything you know it has the best the<br>world's the best systems in the world<br>for talent management or performance<br>reviews automated online you know<br>ranking systems we had an allstaff<br>incentive program where every single<br>member of the staff of these it was<br>either on a sales incentive or an annual<br>short-term and seen of structurally and<br>loyalty I frameworks and look the stark<br>truth I think the sort of realization<br>after after the results of the last two<br>years there's no sign of any of those<br>things either making any difference<br>positively so we've thrown at it'll make<br>sure it's exactly this actually I mean<br>until I'm just doing about frameworks<br>not you know not good management but but<br>you know all of those systems things I<br>just you cannot point to a single<br>indicator in the company that says they<br>are we did that there and it made this<br>different so we've tossed it the whole<br>lot and we're starting over again and<br>there you know that we've scraped all of<br>the online performance management<br>systems and rating structures and all<br>that sort of thing we've just gone back<br>to a good old monthly one-on-one with<br>your boss and we're currently working<br>through with our managers teaching them<br>how to have a one-on-one conversation<br>every month you know it is that basic<br>and it is amazing because you forget how<br>big organizations will get out of touch<br>with us it's the highest rating training<br>the company's ever done so because I<br>don't think God for just telling us<br>something useful stead of all the high<br>you know high you know high-faluting<br>sort of leadership stuff we've done for<br>many essays from other universities not<br>but you know very so very focused and<br>centers we've we've moved away from<br>short-term incentives for for the vast<br>majority of staff we just pulled that<br>back to being a senior scheme only and<br>you know the line is a few better than<br>your neighbor and you produce better<br>results guess what we'll just pay you<br>more you know we don't have to have all<br>of us complex process actually in New<br>Zealand's had to take actually New<br>Zealand's don't like ranking systems and<br>they don't like force distributions and<br>you know very elegant Aryan people and<br>say it's you know some of those things<br>work a lot easier and multinationals and<br>another and other countries but I've<br>never seen them work particularly well<br>in new zealand new zealand employees<br>hate being forced into ranking systems<br>and things that govern they will see it<br>as grossly unfair so why bother really<br>you know we would move away from it so<br>incentives are we trying to narrow down<br>and incentives and and also make them<br>much more tightly linked to real<br>outcomes cash so everything on STI this<br>year for the senior people is still in<br>the scheme as of out cash so will not<br>not some of the sort of self-fulfilling<br>stuff you know around HR programs and<br>things which are all manipulatable and<br>you know this is it's really simple if<br>you want a bonus at next year we're<br>going to generate a lot more cash that<br>we did last year and similarly our<br>long-term encinas we're just closing<br>down multiple strict schemes in in<br>framing emitting very tightly around<br>total returns to shareholders as simple<br>he little constructs and if you want big<br>outcomes you've got to deliver a big tsr<br>to get them so so straightforward and<br>you know I'm in the same I carry my<br>principal wazers I live the same targets<br>is the organization's got on either I'll<br>operate in the same schemes subject to<br>the<br>you know in a listed company the CEO is<br>a oftens have to be mean as differently<br>in a list of environment because they<br>are approved by shareholders we are the<br>staff act but and but as far as possible<br>everything is lined up so we're all and<br>we're all out so let's talk about the<br>courageous conversations mean on a<br>monthly basis good with the ball how<br>bored contribute to a turnaround effort<br>like the one that you know you're going<br>to get way look I think boards and you<br>know I work with a few boards over the<br>over the years and then I think New<br>Zealand directors by lads are very very<br>good and we're good at building boards<br>that are balanced in bring collective<br>skills together and we're that with our<br>the best in sometimes we're they're not<br>so good in needs of encouraging along as<br>is bringing collective are the the mere<br>'it's of the sort of independent people<br>on the board who bring different<br>perspectives but actually channeling<br>that to some direction for the executive<br>team so we're we're aboard can be<br>annoying as we never ones just voicing<br>an opinion and they can be quite often<br>very different opinions around a diverse<br>board table they often leave the CEO<br>thing at all i I'll just go and do<br>whatever I wanted which I can sometimes<br>be inclined to do or what the hell do I<br>make of that and so I think you know the<br>most important thing for aboard is to<br>debate but bring to to channel it in to<br>an outcome and and then I think see<br>Candace do to really get focused around<br>the big value where is the big prize the<br>big value generation and not distract<br>the organization actually and so boards<br>can get there are always at risk in<br>particularly in an environment where you<br>know governance governance governance<br>sort of you know more and more rules and<br>more and more penalties for directors if<br>they break the rules which I get by you<br>know it's it can take boards dead<br>a lot of sort of things that really are<br>at the margins for the company actually<br>I get why they want to do them but we<br>you know you're really avoiding the<br>distractions if these are like these a<br>big job to do is just have the board<br>back getting the big job done because<br>organization can only carry a limited<br>number of big challenges at once and say<br>it's the sequencing I think sometimes<br>the most important things yep so step<br>back and talk about the digital like a<br>dream for you open up to the audience<br>here because there's been a lot of<br>publicity recently about the negative<br>impacts that the Internet has had about<br>the quality of social and economic life<br>with Miss in of the semi what do you<br>think that losing business might<br>practically do to ameliorate these<br>negative impacts yeah look we you know<br>we're is where the enabler of the<br>internet and you know one of the enables<br>of the engineer in New Zealand and in<br>you know we do we we clearly profit from<br>either the rapid uptake and the change<br>front but I do watch as a you know as a<br>business leader and as a father they you<br>know the downsides of a lot of a sort of<br>online world and in our concei you know<br>we can see a lot of them we've you know<br>the security issues that the government<br>is trying to deal with today which they<br>really don't know how to deal with to be<br>honest II making laws that are sort of<br>very hopeful about you know and it's<br>technologically extremely difficult to<br>manage security in a in an online world<br>you know it's you want to write laws<br>that say we we want to be able to<br>intercept things and actually you can't<br>because they are encrypted and it's very<br>hard to we can turn it we can make a<br>copy of a bit stream but we can't turn<br>it into something anyone can read or use<br>so so there are technological problems<br>with what we need to do to protect the<br>country's security and you know the tech<br>space has been is being aggressively<br>eroded by weightless businesses who<br>leave now<br>thing behind in New Zealand you know the<br>likes of Apple and Google who stripped<br>hundreds of millions of revenue out and<br>pay effectively no texts and they don't<br>have any they don't have any employees<br>that ain't leavin e they don't rent any<br>buildings they don't they don't buy from<br>any suppliers so you know those they you<br>know in a world on online with these<br>global organizations are different to<br>the global organizations of twenty years<br>ago who you know Toyota came here a long<br>time ago but it's set up a great big<br>business of bricks and mortar and it's<br>got heaps of employees and thighs staff<br>see you know leaves are fear but on the<br>ground these modern businesses don't so<br>we've got to deal with that and you know<br>i worry about what my six-year-old sees<br>when he's playing around on minecraft<br>and clicks a couple of the leads along<br>and suddenly is on stuff that you really<br>are yo yo really and you know this yeah<br>i'll watch what my teenagers do there<br>you know that i get enough sleep anymore<br>they know this sort of area yeah but the<br>you know the tenancy i mean i think the<br>current stared is you know the average<br>smartphone user reaches for the phone<br>150 times a day if you think about<br>yourself that will be true but for<br>teenagers probably a lot more than that<br>actually others that know yeah so these<br>things have got nigam and i don't think<br>you know given the rate of change let's<br>bring on the country in the business<br>community are moving fast enough to<br>respond to those changes actually and<br>say you know that something is a<br>business community we need to get more<br>resolute about in to work with the<br>government cuz i don't think you can<br>just call on the government to solve<br>these problems they often can but but I<br>you know I think we do we do need to do<br>more and that is about the right<br>organizations getting together and<br>committing to it and often it needs<br>competitors to get in a room and we're<br>overly sensitive sometimes a new zealand<br>about competitors being in a room<br>sorting the stuff out too<br>if you're going to manage some of these<br>risks it does need a sophisticated way<br>of allowing competed as to work together<br>on some things and not be seen to be up<br>too dodgy stuff and you know but you<br>know I certainly in telecom we're up for<br>that in you know I want us to be part of<br>responding to those things so a leader<br>in the news is it's I think yep yep yeah<br>well oh and this you know New Zealand<br>and certainly at Alton the airport it<br>was a great opportunity to see New<br>Zealand think at its best tonight you<br>know we went hunting to get the Chinese<br>to to fly to New Zealand that was boy it<br>was a powerful portrayal of you know a<br>small country where you know dozen a<br>dozen CEOs in a few government senior<br>ministers got could get together work<br>out a plan in launch a multi-prong you<br>know bid to get to get the Chinese to<br>come here and they did and i made an<br>unbelievable difference to the economy<br>the number to source of visitors for New<br>Zealand already which is a staggering<br>outcome and that's when your scenes they<br>didn't work it as best as small as a<br>real advantage in that way you know we<br>you're able to get things done but but<br>smaller's are different as a huge<br>disadvantage when we get silly and<br>argumentative or what internally<br>competitive and that still happens far<br>more than that should in New Zealand so<br>again having business leaders work<br>together were they more you know usually<br>there's a greater prize and you know<br>being a small country in the bottom of<br>the planet in in collaborating as<br>industries you know fonterra I think<br>it's probably the best recent example of<br>that you know an industry that that<br>hunts as a peck globally rather than<br>gets all hung up on internal competition<br>I think he gives and we just get a<br>little bit too worried about internal<br>factors when we should really say well<br>we're actually mostly most sectors were<br>a small player and a global<br>we should add as a pack much more than<br>we do the rest of all was blissfully<br>ignorant about the surface in terms of<br>hunting is apparent that the critical<br>leadership question that mustache and<br>he's what leadership lessons did you<br>personally derive from the America's Cup<br>but this question was formulated two<br>weeks ago a different end in mind but I<br>still think it's about it so what do you<br>think we could learn from and I did have<br>a heads up on this question scratching<br>me but I've actually dawned on me that<br>their answers you know that the most<br>profound leadership act occurred been<br>spittle called the timeout actually say<br>when I reflect on it and what were they<br>down 80 or something in the government I<br>think you know was 77 lil for something<br>like that anymore that's what we called<br>it and he basically said look we're<br>stuffed we we cannot come out here again<br>and do this again because we're going to<br>get the same result any he was brave<br>enough to you know if ever will take the<br>mickey out of them for for that puter<br>night we all after them thought they was<br>completely devoid of ideas they just you<br>know they-they-they time out of the<br>second race that day and went back to<br>the shed but those guys are effectively<br>at their point he called it he said<br>we're in trouble with we have not got a<br>story here that can beat this team and<br>they win and whatever I don't know what<br>they did but they made a series they<br>clearly made several material<br>interventions in their team and that<br>boat whatever and came out that was<br>risking because you know they had two or<br>three days to do that and I think was a<br>very risky move but it was a big cool<br>they made it and they came out and they<br>unbeatable after that so they made<br>enough changes to respond and say you<br>know for me it is a little bit about<br>what we're doing at telecoms we cannot<br>keep you know we had if we're going to<br>break out of a 10 year losing streak we<br>have got
