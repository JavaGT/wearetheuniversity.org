everyone welcome to this what<br>nbm sort of an nbm live Facebook chat<br>session um so my name is Jeremy Tomkins<br>um I'm actually from New Zealand so I'm<br>from the Bay of Plenty um and if you're<br>overseas students uh do visit that when<br>you come here um and I started the nbm<br>along with Shakti who who talking a sec<br>we started that in November last year so<br>hand over to Shakti right guys hi uh<br>this is shaki and uh I belong to India<br>the southern part of India from Chennai<br>and uh I strongly believe that uh the<br>New Zealand culture is truly a blessed<br>one and that drove me to uh coming to<br>New Zealand and uh the course has been<br>such a huge uh you know journey I should<br>say uh till now and uh this apparently I<br>think 3 months left now so hope for the<br>best now and uh yeah the MBM is I as you<br>see him laughing it is kind of you know<br>ups and downs ups and downs and it<br>doesn't give you much of a break in<br>between but it learns I mean it teaches<br>you a lot so yeah it's quite hectic and<br>knowledgeable too yeah like I probably<br>agree with shy on that one it is it is a<br>bit of a roller coaster you could say um<br>that you're you're always constantly<br>doing something I find and that it's<br>always interesting you're learning<br>something new um because I think that<br>probably leads us on to our next part we<br>can talk about is um why we sort of<br>chose to study it I guess um I know for<br>me that i' completed a four-year<br>undergraduate degree here at wetto<br>University um and I thought oh why not<br>what the heck give give a masters a<br>crack it's another year um plus as well<br>being on this IM Hillary scholarship<br>program here through the uni um it was a<br>good opportunity to uh further that as<br>well so that was just my book but what<br>was it for you sh t uh for me it was<br>kind of you know on the other side it<br>was like U uh you know I was more into<br>technical I was a tech sa person and U I<br>belong to the electronics and<br>communication side I was an engineer and<br>uh post that I had to work x three three<br>years and after that I was looking more<br>into something that was you know<br>management driven so I uh was looking at<br>different countries to go into and uh I<br>was actually uh thinking about us<br>Australia Canada and uh New Zealand and<br>finally I landed in New Zealand and uh I<br>believe that MBM is a short version of<br>uh uh how businesses run in U you know<br>uh daily life in in a routine and U yeah<br>I I think it's quite an important aspect<br>that every individual has to uh you know<br>potentially have them uh regardless of<br>the person whether he or she belongs to<br>running a business or not and uh yeah we<br>should talk about the internships and<br>how the program is and Jeremy will talk<br>you too yeah cuz I think just before<br>that we should actually say cuz I think<br>you might not know um because it's a<br>onee masters so everything's condensed<br>into that onee program which is a lot<br>different to a lot of other master's<br>degrees I should say um out there um<br>like that and I think that how many cuz<br>we've got is it 16 oh yeah 16 so 16<br>papers from November till November so it<br>doesn't actually run through the course<br>of one year it's split over like a<br>little bit of one year and majority of<br>one um like that and everything and at<br>the moment we're doing the business<br>research paper both of us um we're both<br>with different companies in that um in<br>that regard like that but that's sort of<br>going for 3 weeks now and then we'll<br>continue working on it when we go back<br>next week to classes whilst we're doing<br>the other papers as well um like that<br>but all all of them ranging the papers<br>they range from Finance to marketing um<br>um economics just finished before the<br>intership so they all been I know for<br>myself quite interesting y um like I've<br>learned Lots because I sort of want to<br>use the Masters to go towards a<br>principal job um later on life and<br>teaching um that and everything so I<br>think cuz how long how long is The<br>Internship actually sh is it uh for me<br>it's uh 1 and a half months yeah yeah<br>for me it's I think it's going to be uh<br>two two 3 weeks L yeah because it<br>started away a bit more you know for so<br>well in advanced so yeah cuz cuz how do<br>you think cuz I know for me it's<br>slightly different cuz I'm from New<br>Zealand but how has it helped you the<br>program all right yeah on that aspect I<br>think is is more in depth about uh what<br>actually is happening in the company and<br>they deal with you more uh what do you<br>say there's more of interpersonal<br>connection um and you know what is<br>happening within the course and uh<br>within the company as to how the<br>company's dealing with different<br>segments in different sectors so it's a<br>different uh you know whole range of<br>View and you get a 360° view of you know<br>what exactly is happening in the thing<br>and you have to do a lot of background<br>research and you know uh when you set up<br>a meeting say for half an hour or just<br>an hour it's like you're going to meet<br>the CEO of the company and you got to<br>get the best in front of him and if<br>that's not the case then it looks kind<br>of ugly so uh use the best time and when<br>it's given to you make them most of it<br>yeah that's got it um could say any<br>better um<br>like that and everything but I think I<br>think in general cuz I know I found the<br>stuff quite helpful like if you have a<br>sort of if you have in trouble one your<br>papers or you need someone to talk to<br>especially if you're from overseas there<br>only thing I know for myself I find it<br>quite useful that um Kathy she's been<br>really helpful and so many other people<br>on the program that you can just sit<br>down you can have a bit of a chat with<br>or a yarn as I like to call it um just<br>about things in general really or talk<br>to fellow um talk to your fellow course<br>colleagues or anything like that I think<br>really um yeah just about anything<br>really so don't because it can I think<br>make you feel overwhelmed like that even<br>though you don't need to feel<br>overwhelmed that's sort of my view have<br>have you found it you found that's<br>actually totally true on what Jeremy is<br>just saying it's like uh you know I've<br>been facing this dwindle on times like<br>okay I'm you know what if this happens<br>what if that happens and I go to my<br>mentors like seek assistance and you<br>know guidance and there's always Kathy<br>there's michella there's Michelle and so<br>on who's always given uh continuous<br>efforts and continuous you know push uh<br>for us to thrive and uh we have<br>wonderful lectures coming and visiting<br>faculties coming from different parts of<br>New Zealand as well and they cover a<br>whole wide range of different aspects<br>when it comes to businesses and how uh<br>it runs on a daily basis so uh we get<br>like uh a simple example would be uh<br>daily journals or daily articles we<br>would have to you know read them through<br>in classes and that gives you a<br>practical example of you know how as a<br>third person you look at an article and<br>you know what you interpret and that<br>gives you immense values so uh the<br>learning has been quite an enhanced one<br>it's totally a different trans<br>transformative one for me as uh an<br>international student because I find it<br>kind of different when you compare it<br>with uh outside uh New Zealand and<br>outside India as such uh because I've<br>you know been in Middle East as well so<br>it's kind of you know on and off so I<br>find newand is a wonderful place and<br>especially University of AO with the<br>Triple Crown comption that's bull yeah<br>like that's that's sort of why I chose<br>to study at white out in the first place<br>um from all the other universities when<br>I first started here five five years ago<br>instead been that long um was purely<br>because it has a I think it has it has a<br>really good teaching environment but<br>also um it's got a relaxed environment<br>as well you don't feel overwhelmed like<br>everything's in one place you don't have<br>to traes across a city for 45 minutes or<br>something like that if you're in<br>Wellington um like that but I think the<br>teaching style as well would you agree<br>um that it's it's I know for me having<br>done the undergraduate degree here it is<br>different again in this master's program<br>like there's in your undergraduate<br>degree I think you're more in a way told<br>what to do uh in a sense like that but<br>then the Master's one that um the man<br>here at the management faculty they<br>realized that we're young professionals<br>we're actually young adults and been<br>treated like young young adults so<br>actually seem to think for ourselves<br>think what to do on this aspect and I<br>think the internship at the moment is a<br>good example of that that you're not<br>being handheld through everything you're<br>actually having to think for yourself<br>because when you go out and get a job<br>you're not going to have someone there<br>supporting you or well you will but<br>you're not it's not like having M dad<br>there 24/7 all the time like that um so<br>it's about that growing up aspect and<br>everything like that but the your<br>teaching styles um I think one that<br>stood out for me is is it yens y i<br>saying it right um Yin he's he's a<br>different one he's a good BL like that<br>um but yeah I I think he's he's sort of<br>a stand at one for me and you there have<br>been a couple of lectures that have come<br>in and presented sort of an usual style<br>but overall it's been uh different<br>different I think what would you agree I<br>I Reon the same I mean yeah I reckon the<br>same because U but out there in India<br>like uh we had Aon in communication it<br>was more of a technical thing and uh<br>people were totally uh what do you say<br>brain drained you should say there's to<br>you know so much of information on just<br>a piece of paper and you had to just go<br>all by yourself and uh you know you just<br>had to there's no assistance as such<br>also and uh here I mean there was<br>initially it's like U I would say like a<br>game level it's like a Pokémon go or<br>something don't know if it's like<br>Pokemon I'm not a fan of Pokemon go I'll<br>keep my reservations about that<br>but so it's just like you know that the<br>level of difficulty just progresses with<br>the time and so the papers are put in<br>such a way that it starts with the level<br>of you know average and then it just<br>hits the medium and then it goes on and<br>on and steps up<br>and then when you have the brps in uh<br>for people who do not know what BRP is<br>it's a business research project and<br>that is the 25 Point uh the major uh<br>portion of uh our course which is 18<br>credited and uh this particular BRP is<br>uh mainly been uh taken care by yens<br>Professor yens and he is uh providing<br>sort of continuous support as to how to<br>communicate with the uh you know<br>stakeholders and with all of our<br>companies that we got internships and it<br>kind of gives a different uh arena for<br>us to battle into so yeah I totally<br>agree with what Jeremy says in that<br>context yeah yeah cuz I think I think<br>you could see that quite well sh as well<br>um like that and everything but you<br>think cuz how have you cuz I know I've<br>been here now for a while but how have<br>you found it as a student y what's it<br>been like what's it been like for you<br>coming to a completely new culture are<br>that in being a stud I must say it's<br>totally overwhelming because uh the<br>access that you get the people they so<br>warm friendly I mean right even no no<br>really uh even at the bus stop they<br>would you know give you a a total<br>leaflet with the directions and<br>everything they they're not like oh he's<br>Indian oh man no no I'm not going to<br>help you out it's not like that to be<br>honest I uh I'm not saying that you know<br>I'm not saying this just to flatter<br>people or something like that but it's<br>totally generous of them and they're<br>very kind very warm-hearted and they<br>would like to help and they're lovely<br>people and they love volunteering and<br>that's such an important thing in life<br>and I feel that New Zealand is a place<br>of low population they have less in<br>number but they have one huge number of<br>Hearts so New Zealand is a second home<br>to me oh oh that's beautiful I haven't<br>heard New Zealand put that for great in<br>a<br>while but you know it's pretty true like<br>I think for me I've enjoyed I know for<br>myself that having I haven't actually<br>been overseas myself so um overseas has<br>kind of come to me in a way through this<br>program um like that so you got all all<br>the all like yourself from overseas and<br>everything like that and it's it's<br>really really interesting I find<br>learning about all these different<br>cultures as well this is a this is a<br>side from the study aspect of it that<br>learning what makes you guys tck and<br>everything like that and what's<br>important to you is entirely different<br>what's important to me um like that but<br>yeah I think that sort of his keyways we<br>welcome you in and everything like that<br>and stuff like that and I think the W<br>campus is quite quite good for that and<br>everything like that and stuff and if<br>you're watching guys do ask questions<br>you know you can type and ask questions<br>and stuff like that I forgot to add ear<br>um like that but what should we how many<br>tips do you think we'll give for<br>students who want to study the MB what<br>how many should we give top three uh<br>yeah top three what would be your top<br>three tips uh I think fitting in a<br>proper resume that's a CB yeah a good CV<br>with the key bullet points you know un<br>like saying that I fancy dancing and I<br>fancy singing and you know I'm a person<br>doing this uh I mean spot the main<br>points that you think are the bullet<br>striking features that you have in you<br>that could you know potentially land<br>your job and apart from that I think uh<br>knowing what your strength is and focus<br>on that more and see how that could play<br>an important role with the courses<br>coming through and uh see as to why you<br>have to choose MBM if you are going to<br>and do a background research I mean<br>research is a key important thing that<br>is currently being done right for now<br>because um I am put up in a company that<br>um to be frank I'm doing an internship<br>in a company that is uh more of you know<br>dealing with uh health and safety and I<br>come from another background so it from<br>a third person's point of view I look at<br>it as you know just something vague but<br>now once I start researching it goes<br>inside deep down and I get the facts<br>right so research is an important thing<br>and if you want to be MBM student then I<br>think you have to to research what you<br>have in you and what the course offers<br>and if it matches<br>bu well yeah I agree with it I think the<br>one thing um could would be that um<br>don't be afraid to ask questions um<br>because if you don't ask the question<br>you're never going to know the answer to<br>it really and if you haven't asked a<br>question and you should have you could<br>be kicking yourself for it at the end of<br>the day um like that the second thing is<br>that um just don't be afraid to tell and<br>meet new people and anything like that<br>and stuff like that I think just put<br>yourself put out there don't don't be<br>afraid of who you um like that sort of<br>stick to you stick to your guns I think<br>that's quite a Ki we saying um stick to<br>your guns um and sort of stay cuz you're<br>going to have your strength and<br>weaknesses throughout the papers and<br>everything like that and welcome group<br>work um like that which is something<br>I've I've had to doal because I haven't<br>done much group work myself in my under<br>graduate degree um like that because you<br>are going to be working with a variety<br>of people from the course who have<br>different strengths and weaknesses to<br>you and you actually have to sit down<br>and work it out and in a in a well and<br>reasonable manner like that because I<br>know there have been instances where it<br>hasn't gone according to play like that<br>or anything like that but that's just<br>the whole process of learning I think at<br>the end of the day that if you're<br>learning it now then it'll be easy for<br>you once you're in a business um and the<br>third thing would probably enjoy<br>yourself um like that it's a year um<br>it's not that long like that so do it<br>that would be my advice I'm kiwi I did<br>it so um that everything yeah no I I<br>definitely encourage it<br>yeah that but I got too much else to add<br>have you got anything else uh yeah I<br>mean um the other side to uh New Zealand<br>as in uh the MBM as as well uh you start<br>off with the first paper and then you<br>get a huge break because you face uh I<br>mean in case you're planning to take the<br>November intake uh as for us it was like<br>we had a break of around 20 days uh<br>where uh we were allowed to you know<br>just spend our times go on holidays and<br>stuff like that so uh we had this break<br>and uh that was apparently the I think<br>the only break that we had that was kind<br>of huge like on a whole and that allowed<br>a lot of time for us to go and explore<br>the places and for international<br>students that's not a place that's not a<br>time for you to go back to your place or<br>something like that in case you feel<br>home homesick because there are a lot of<br>places you have to explore there's wi of<br>caves there's B of Plenty there's Tanga<br>and there's the list going on and on and<br>on que que Christ<br>Church all around so basically there's<br>heaps heaps I think cuz CU on that note<br>I think that there there is there are<br>like as long as you're managing your<br>time wisely and everything like that you<br>are going to have days where you can go<br>and explore and do things like that but<br>if you are from M's and think and<br>wanting to do this program going back<br>whilst you are studying will put a lot<br>of pressure on you true um like that and<br>everything there something I probably<br>wouldn't recommend either yeah and you<br>have the the extra activities like<br>trkking hiking W jumping and you know<br>all of that so that adds value to your<br>activity Explorations does all cost<br>money though it's not free should have<br>addressed it it's not free so make sure<br>cars as well yeah as well um so yeah but<br>no no like and you can also um like cuz<br>I've got a couple of part-time jobs as<br>well whil whil doing Masters um like<br>that so it is manageable to do that um<br>in stad because you do need a little bit<br>doy said I think the last point is a key<br>important thing I mean if uh you're an<br>international student you would<br>definitely need to you know balance out<br>your money your savings the money coming<br>from home so you would have to look at<br>how you you know manage your expenses so<br>I think planning a part-time job would<br>be a key thing so yeah once you head in<br>just you know try giving in your CVS<br>here and there and you should get one<br>yeah and if you don't have if you don't<br>have very good budgeting skills at the<br>moment you've got what 3 months to<br>refine them yeah yeah um so 3 months to<br>sort of refine it like that so yeah get<br>your orig done and everything yeah okay<br>we have a few questions that coming from<br>the public question wonder you could<br>answer them for<br>us first one is it difficult to complete<br>the program because it's it is 180<br>points in a<br>year you it I'll take it um you can help<br>me out um no it's not difficult to um<br>complete it from my point of view um<br>just because I'd already done a 4-year<br>undergraduate degree which was slightly<br>more points than what this was um like<br>that but at the end of the day I I've<br>been doing the papers and haven't really<br>been thinking about the points as such I<br>think you worry about it by a paper by<br>paper basis then sort of planning<br>forward and everything and that if you<br>have have that drive of wanting to do<br>well and get that b and above average or<br>a average or what average you want to<br>get um cuz C's don't get degrees um<br>that's a myth yeah do not get degrees um<br>it it is manageable you've just got to<br>manage your time and every everything<br>around it like that and it is it is like<br>it is definitely doable like it is<br>challenging at times but you're always<br>going to have things that are<br>challenging at times that's really so<br>yeah I mean uh just adding on to it um<br>you you might see it as 180 credit paper<br>but uh when you just split it along it<br>says it has 16 papers in it so your uh<br>aim would be to you know look at the<br>short run so just complete one by one by<br>one by one and suddenly all of a sudden<br>you see all of it g vanished and it's<br>trust me it's not a hard paper it's like<br>you can easily clear getting an average<br>b or B+ and if you would want to you<br>know Drive push that extra you know yard<br>and earn that A's or a pluses then yeah<br>just all nights and spend time in the<br>labs here maybe not all nighters just<br>you know I've never been one for all<br>nighters I can't I can't stop too late<br>um like that<br>but it it is doable just you just manage<br>everything around it and you'll be sweet<br>I mean if you're a night all<br>then it you're done action learning<br>program can you tell us about that and<br>how long it is oh we haven't done it yet<br>no that's still to come that's actually<br>still to come um there's more of an<br>Explorer yeah yeah so that is so that's<br>pretty much so up until now we've done<br>as 12 paper we've done 12 four left yeah<br>so 12 papers so we've done 12 papers up<br>until we started um The Internship The<br>Internship is number 13 and then we have<br>a design thinking Innovation paper<br>that's number 140 and then hang on let's<br>go look at my list project action<br>learning project that one where's the<br>other one yeah that's 15 and oh yeah 16<br>yeah there we go I can't count um oh my<br>mess is letting me down um so they're<br>suting together um like that and<br>everything and the action learning<br>project is where you're working in<br>groups again and you're developing an<br>idea for a you're developing idea for a<br>new company that you want to start as<br>sort of the information that we've been<br>given so far but there's more to come to<br>you so what kind of preparation should a<br>course oh you going to do it you do it<br>go<br>go to be honest you don't have to do<br>much of preparation for this course<br>because it gives you a total different<br>insight and towards a business point of<br>view and uh there's a brief intro right<br>from the word go in the first paper so<br>they give you the you know uh hint as to<br>how it goes how it flows so you would I<br>think the only takeaway uh that possibly<br>you could have is uh maybe just uh try<br>to work two at a time work two like try<br>multitasking try two papers at a time<br>and you know you would have to do<br>assignments of one paper and then at the<br>same time just don't lose track of when<br>the due date for the next assignment of<br>the other paper is so yeah that would be<br>the only thing but it's not you know you<br>know quenching or draining something<br>like that manable don't anything more<br>now you find you and just finally we<br>just got one more question I want to ask<br>you you talked a little bit earlier on<br>about um you know the kind of work that<br>you want to get into can you can you<br>talk to me a little bit about what kinds<br>of jobs that this program could lead<br>into what kind of careers are you<br>looking at oh you<br>you I mean uh this is again is a Masters<br>in Business and management so as long as<br>you manage everything and as long as you<br>get your you know uh view regarding<br>business right you're going to get all<br>the sort of openings right in front of<br>you so uh it does not give you uh it<br>does not limit you to a a particular uh<br>job skill set it does not say that okay<br>uh you've specialized in this so this is<br>only the options that you have so you<br>have a wide range of scope wide reg of<br>options you can enter the marketing<br>sector you can enter the sales you can<br>enter the finance and you could go you<br>know way ahead you could also enter the<br>legal section if you have like more uh<br>you know knowledge about the corporate<br>laws and everything so there's the IT<br>industry to explor as well so all of<br>this would be done in papers for it you<br>have digital business for corporate law<br>you have uh law and yeah for I mean for<br>legal you have corporate law for uh uh s<br>you know for knowing about the business<br>you have sustainability and then overall<br>management you have HR management and<br>then you have organization culture so<br>yeah there's a wide range of uh Scopes<br>available yeah I've got nothing more to<br>add that was good nothing more<br>to yeah um so yeah so I think that's<br>pretty much into of the questions I've<br>I've got nothing more to say do you<br>anything to say uh no I mean if you're<br>an national student and if you think uh<br>I mean if you because I had this U you<br>know hindering my mind whether you know<br>I have to land uh you know an option in<br>New Zealand or Canada or Australia or us<br>I mean just decide one where you want to<br>be and what you are really looking at<br>and uh if you really think that MBM is<br>the thing for you and if you think that<br>one year you could you know just spend<br>and and trust me it's not going to be<br>tough so it's going to be an easy Course<br>and there is always assistance there<br>always mentors to guide you and it's a<br>wonderful goost there will be tough<br>Parts there there will be there will be<br>tough Parts it's not all easy just want<br>to like that um so yeah if you're kiwi<br>international student give it a go um<br>you only live once you haven't got<br>anything to lose and it's a master's up<br>your sleep at the end of the day so um<br>that's all from us so thanks for<br>watching guys and have a good one
