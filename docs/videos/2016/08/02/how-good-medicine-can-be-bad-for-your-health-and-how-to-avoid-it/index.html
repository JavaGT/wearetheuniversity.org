a great honor to be invited to give<br>this lecture and I feel very old<br>actually it's many decades since I said<br>as a medical student and the same seats<br>that you're sitting in today and it's<br>it's an honor not just because it's one<br>of the public lecture series for the<br>School of Medicine but also because it's<br>my inaugural professorial lecture I can<br>see around the lecture theatre friends<br>and family and colleagues who've<br>traveled on this long journey with me<br>and supported me all the way through<br>many of you will have heard all the<br>things I'm going to say before so I<br>thank you for for coming to mark this<br>occasion and for all the support that<br>you've all given me over the years<br>so public lectures should be<br>thought-provoking so my aim today is to<br>make you feel uncomfortable at least<br>initially and then by the middle of the<br>lecture maybe convinced and then by the<br>end excited about the possibilities as<br>we go forward amid some thickness I<br>think I want to make you uncomfortable<br>cuz I think we're on the edge of a huge<br>leap forward and medical care to make<br>one of the big and major changes to the<br>way we practice but it will require a<br>shift in the way that we as doctors and<br>us patients approach me to hook here and<br>it's from discomfort that these kind of<br>advances arise so what do we want from<br>medical care what's good medical care<br>for ourselves and for our families and<br>this is my working definition of<br>effective care it's recognition of a<br>patient's needs by a clinician with the<br>imagination and empathy to understand<br>what they're trying to convey<br>consideration by both of the best that<br>medical science has to offer in a<br>relationship that'll maximize the<br>benefits of either deciding to use a<br>treatment or deciding not to so a place<br>where a patient feels both heard and<br>known and medical cares come a long way<br>now the 1600 s was a bad time for<br>dangerous caring this is charles ii and<br>he had a fall after he had a fit while<br>he was shaving and he was apparently<br>treated<br>with the beautiful best medical advice<br>at the time and attended by 14<br>physicians a few of which you can see<br>clustered about him here and they<br>recommended this range of treatments<br>from you can choose your personal<br>unfortunately despite the best medical<br>care in the land at the time two days<br>later he died but medicines come a long<br>way since then isn't it we've put<br>mechanisms in place to stop bad<br>medicines part of my time has spent<br>working now at McMaster University which<br>is the birthplace of evidence-based<br>medicine evidence-based medicine is a<br>phrase that's used to describe the gold<br>standard of good medical care a system<br>that uses controlled trials to make sure<br>drugs used are effective and to protect<br>us all from quackery<br>and just down the road in Rochester New<br>York as we in Luigi lasagne would know<br>Louie lasagna apart from having a<br>fabulous name was a fan apologist so as<br>a specialist in using medicines well and<br>he was responsible for the first ever<br>controlled trial of a drug it was a drug<br>that flew through that first<br>effectiveness trial and I'm gonna leave<br>you does anybody know what that drug was<br>well sure a glass of wine with anyone<br>now meet Katherine Katherine presents<br>also after a fall at home and Katherine<br>also had 14 doctors she's 85 years old<br>and she takes these medicines and this<br>scenario will be familiar to you you or<br>your mother or your father has multiple<br>pills to take at multiple times during<br>the day a blister pack might be used to<br>try and reduce the confusion and keep<br>things on track in Katherine's not<br>unusual<br>Catherines everywhere here in New<br>Zealand because the average number of<br>medicines that people over 65 are taking<br>in this country now is seven so we've<br>moved to a world where the commonest<br>condition is actually to have multiple<br>conditions and it's not just a feature<br>of age in fact the largest number of<br>people with multiple conditions like<br>Kathryn and are under 65 years of age in<br>priority here general practice this<br>makes for a complex but really<br>interesting world in which to practice<br>and it's a really complex world of<br>medicines so a third of our patients in<br>our our more than five medicines and<br>just over ten percent take more than ten<br>medicines so where's the problem<br>surely if you need the pills to stay<br>healthy then you need the pills the<br>problem is the more pills you take the<br>more likely you are to have a side<br>effect or that one of your pills is<br>going to interact with one of the other<br>ones of your pills or one of the other<br>conditions that you hear so pill that<br>looks like a good idea in the face of it<br>when added to the mix of your other<br>pills and illnesses can give you more<br>problems than it solves it's a bit like<br>music if we listen to a bat violin<br>sonata or a Brahms trio or some Miles<br>Davis chairs or Liu Yun's Armstrong<br>playing on the trumpet on their own they<br>sound wonderful and they do us good but<br>if we play them all together at the same<br>time it's a cacophony that does us no<br>good at all in this cacophony is an<br>invisible pandemic and you can see here<br>let you read for yourself the kinds of<br>effects that this sort of combination<br>treatment is having the side effects<br>from medicine now our source of a huge<br>amount of illness and death across the<br>world in the rate of this illness and<br>death goes up sharply was the number of<br>drugs taken it's invisible in all our<br>measures of care though but this causes<br>more harm than many of the diseases that<br>drugs are designed to treat in Europe<br>we've got the best data more people die<br>every<br>adverse drug effects then of many of the<br>diseases they're designed to treat so<br>more people die of adverse drug effects<br>in Europe every year than die of breast<br>cancer or of colon cancer or of lung<br>cancer it's the equivalent of two jumbo<br>jet crashes every day killing everybody<br>on board now if this was an airline<br>would you fly on it<br>the fleet would be grounded until the<br>problems were sorted out but there's<br>patients people flying this airline<br>every day but this caused a death an<br>illness is largely lost in the hype<br>around epidemics of cardiovascular<br>disease or cancer or the need to treat<br>diabetes or high blood pressure or<br>osteoporosis yet there are no measures<br>in place to prevent this much more<br>common cause of illness and death and<br>it's not just invisible but it's<br>expensive for our health systems with<br>limited budgets you can see here and<br>this was this was a study down quite a<br>while ago so the costs are likely to be<br>higher than this but for every every<br>million of the adults in the community<br>in the u.s. 27 million dollars is spent<br>on the treatment of preventable adverse<br>events from drugs<br>now not all are preventable but around<br>about a third probably are predictable<br>and preventable so these are avoidable<br>costs to our health care system and it<br>doesn't just harm patients in terms of<br>adverse effects it also harms by<br>reducing the benefits because when the<br>number of pills leads to confusion like<br>this it's often impossible to take them<br>all which could be protective but in the<br>chaos often the pills that gets skipped<br>may be the ones that are really going to<br>be the most helpful for that person this<br>is uncomfortable fact number two more<br>people in our admitted to hospital from<br>the effects of the drugs to treat<br>diabetes than from the diabetes itself<br>so more people are admitted to hospital<br>than us from hypoglycemia low blood<br>sugar from the medicines than from<br>hypoglycemia from diabetes and in this<br>other study both of these studies came<br>out in the last year<br>now if you're on a blood-pressure<br>medicine and you're older you're much<br>more likely to suffer a serious injury<br>from a fall that someone at the same age<br>who's not on a blood pressure medicine<br>so this is a huge opportunity for us for<br>games for patients and for health<br>budgets but it doesn't mean I think it's<br>as big an opportunity as when we<br>discovered germs and that antibiotics<br>killed them but it doesn't mean a new<br>treatment or new or a new cure it means<br>a paradigm shift a different way of<br>looking at the way we use medicines Midd<br>sin' is all about doing at the moment<br>and we need to refocus on the art of not<br>doing well and to refocus need to kind<br>of think about how we got to this point<br>so the term sacred Monster's was used<br>for the first time in France in the<br>nineteenth century and it applied to the<br>the divas of the stage like syrup but<br>Bernhard who you see here and it really<br>marks the birth of contemporary rock<br>stardom<br>who are these icons of the arts and now<br>sports are given divine status by the<br>audience and are almost untouchable<br>guidelines in medicine were originally<br>developed to summarize what was known in<br>medical science and in recent years<br>their place has written to the status of<br>a kind of sacred monster of a medical<br>care untouchable and unquestionable and<br>the rise of guideline driven here has<br>created a situation where as clinicians<br>we often will feel uneasy if we don't<br>follow them even if the treatment plan<br>we're making we know is it a big<br>and our confusion about what guidelines<br>mean is summarized in this slide here<br>which I'll let you read from that<br>so on the one hand we have clinicians<br>where we feel uncomfortable about<br>following guidelines all the time and on<br>the other side we have politicians and<br>policy makers and health who see<br>guidelines in adherence to them as the<br>way to improve health outcomes for<br>patients and failure to adhere to them<br>as some some sort of pork here so I'm<br>going to give you an example of what I<br>mean by the problems of guidelines so if<br>we take an example of a 70 year old<br>woman and give her what a woman of that<br>age would now have so three diseases<br>that really interfere with her<br>activities and stop her doing the things<br>she would like to do and then some other<br>things that we discovered because as her<br>good doctor I did some measurements and<br>so I told her that she had osteoporosis<br>and high blood pressure and diabetes so<br>let's see what happens when we apply the<br>guidelines for each of his single<br>conditions to hear any guesses as to how<br>bought him clothes yep she'll end up on<br>19 doses of 12 different medicines taken<br>at five times during the day and it<br>doesn't matter which five conditions<br>that you choose the result is always<br>pretty much the same and most<br>importantly numerous opportunities for<br>harm either because the medicines<br>interact with each other or they<br>interact with her other conditions so<br>you can see in this example how the<br>current way of understanding good<br>medicine is adherence to evidence-based<br>guidelines and valuing best practice in<br>this way certainly for us in primary<br>care actually results in what looks like<br>measurably better care this prescriber<br>would be rated as a good doctor on most<br>measures of quality here but it actually<br>ends up being meaningfully worse care<br>for this individual the other thing that<br>it also tells you is that the good<br>medicine that's good for health you need<br>good clinicians prescribers or tuned<br>chemicals into medicines and wise<br>clinicians is what turns them into good<br>medicine<br>and this needs a dialogue between<br>prescribers and patients it's a complex<br>world for patients as well this is the<br>work of dealing with one chronic illness<br>it's extraordinary isn't it two hours a<br>day you have diabetes and it gets<br>increasingly complex as we add other<br>conditions to this multi morbidity you<br>can see that as we add extra conditions<br>the work of chronic illness goes up in<br>an exponential way and this work can<br>become greater than an individual's<br>capacity to cope and here's an example<br>this these are the medications from a<br>home visit that I did with a pharmacist<br>in despite having a blister pack to try<br>and simplify medications these are the<br>pills that this patient was just unable<br>to cope with taking that we found around<br>the house the burden of care that we<br>imposed was simply too great so what's<br>happened to evidence-based medicine and<br>all of this many people think that<br>guideline adherence is evidence-based<br>medicine but it's not you can see here<br>the original definition from Dave<br>Sackett from McMaster University is that<br>evidence-based mints and equally<br>balances the best that medical science<br>has to offer with patient values and<br>priorities for care and their context<br>and their circumstances so the other<br>illnesses and the other diseases but<br>what's happened is that the research<br>evidence has become disconnected from<br>these other important aspects of<br>evidence-based medicine<br>the original idea of the best medical<br>care and this disconnected model of care<br>when it's converted into adherence and<br>in targets for care has twisted<br>evidence-based medicine into a kind of<br>scientific bureaucratic medicine we like<br>the Japanese car production line<br>efficiency models the aim is for<br>standardized treatment for each disease<br>and healthcare end of it increasingly<br>structured along individual production<br>lines for all patients with diabetes or<br>all patients worth high blood pressure<br>what's the idea that it doesn't matter<br>who does it as long as it gets done and<br>that every patient like if we care will<br>be both identical and relatively perfect<br>at the end the patients are neither<br>identical nor perfect and the<br>manifestation of symptoms and the<br>combinations of illnesses are quite<br>unique in every single one and they<br>experience both these in the effects of<br>treatments both inseparably in<br>simultaneously in this production line<br>paradigm of Medicine the focus of care<br>has shifted from the patients and the<br>illnesses from which they suffer to the<br>diseases themselves and in measurement<br>within the patient and this is what<br>happens when we tidy up patients and to<br>their component diseases the loss of<br>meaning and context makes it impossible<br>to hear the melodies of the patient's<br>life and their illnesses and to provide<br>care that will enhance it we as doctors<br>feel this is how we feel about targets<br>for care and we feel more and more<br>pressure not to discontinue medications<br>in order to remain congruent with these<br>best practice targets this has made<br>worse when we're faced with health<br>policy pronouncements that variation and<br>practice is bad in standardization as<br>the answer to improve in health it can<br>drive us to initiate or continue<br>prescriptions where we otherwise<br>wouldn't and it's over focused the<br>medical system on initiating and<br>continuing treatments and taking our<br>gaze away from stopping or reducing them<br>in the UK for example a third of primary<br>care doctors general practitioners<br>income is now based on meeting targets<br>for treatments for particular diseases<br>there's extraordinary and this is the<br>kind of pressure that good prescribers<br>are experiencing that might lead to<br>patients asking are you doing this for<br>and it's not just here in New Zealand<br>the average number of medicines<br>worldwide is now seven clinical trials<br>though exclude these very patients they<br>never include people with multiple<br>illnesses or taking multiple other drugs<br>so really what we're in the middle of as<br>a global experiment with no data<br>collection and I want you to think back<br>to that first ever trial of the drug<br>thalidomide the one that flew through<br>its effectiveness trials the most<br>important effects of thalidomide weren't<br>noticed and so it was tried in the real<br>population so observing and what is<br>happening around us in these real<br>populations is going to be increasingly<br>important we can look at the effects of<br>medicines in the context of multiple<br>illnesses and I want to show you now<br>some work that colleagues and I did a<br>few years ago around this this is a<br>slide of the most common causes of death<br>over the centuries you can see the spike<br>from the Spanish flu epidemic there and<br>I want you to notice two things about<br>this first the extraordinary effect of<br>prevention on infectious disease you can<br>see how steeply that it drops away there<br>but what happens when it drops away is<br>another cause of death Rises discipline<br>is the most common cause of death<br>because at any one point along this<br>graph all of these causes of death must<br>add up to 100% we all have to die or<br>something<br>in this case cardiovascular disease has<br>risen to be the most common cause of<br>death and you can see the effect of<br>prevention or net as well at the second<br>images of a survival curve now the aim<br>of preventive medicines and chronic<br>illnesses to turn this survival curve<br>and to more of a rectangle to enable all<br>of us to live to what will be a normal<br>human lifespan and if we all do that<br>then this curve will look like a<br>rectangle and that is an effect what's<br>happening in New Zealand and most<br>developed countries but what happens if<br>we apply single disease preventive<br>treatments at this end of the rectangle<br>when we're all at or near and<br>normal life span well we simply change<br>the cause of death rather than extending<br>life or reducing illness into some<br>evidence suggests that this is exactly<br>what's happening if you to use an<br>analogy if you take a car or any car<br>that I've ever owned it goes along fine<br>for a while ten years or so and then it<br>starts going wrong and everything starts<br>going wrong live at the same time so if<br>I take that car and I replace the clutch<br>if the alternator is also broken as a<br>hole in the radiator it's not going to<br>go any better or for any longer and this<br>is what's happening when we're a prime<br>client prevention at the end of the<br>lifespan it's also driven by a<br>pharmaceutical industry imperative to<br>get as many people to take as many long<br>to him drugs as possible in the use of<br>statin drugs and carry a vascular<br>disease to low lower cholesterol<br>illustrates this so here's a graph that<br>shows it's the only trial of cholesterol<br>drugs and people over 70 it was<br>thousands of patients and this shows the<br>effects and and where the blue boxes are<br>on the left-hand side of the line it<br>means that you're better off taking the<br>medicine in this case the<br>cholesterol-lowering pill and those<br>outcomes on the left are can you<br>vascular heart disease illness in death<br>so on the face of this it looks a good<br>idea to do this to take these treatments<br>in older age in the same way as a<br>younger age don't you think looks of<br>reasonable but what we did was we looked<br>at all causes we've got the data from<br>this paper knocked at all causes of<br>death and we saw this you can see via<br>the bottom box is right in the middle so<br>there's really no benefit in taking the<br>medicine so why would that be given it<br>seems to have this big effect on heart<br>disease illness and death in the answer<br>was buried and other data from the study<br>in fact the reduction in heart disease<br>or worsened death was balanced by equal<br>rise in cancer diagnosis in death so one<br>cause of illness and death simply<br>so why were the recommendations written<br>in the way they were in the paper and<br>why wasn't this data made clearer the<br>answer probably lies in the conflict of<br>interest declaration at the end of the<br>paper at the top are the physicians<br>who'd receive financial contributions<br>from the pharmaceutical company making<br>the medication and at the bottom is the<br>funder of the trial who are that same<br>pharmaceutical company this makes sense<br>actually because we know that risk is<br>different as you age those are a great<br>study done on Netherlands a few years<br>back where they talk you know we all<br>know about that sort of cardiovascular<br>risk calculation where you take your<br>blood pressure you cholesterol and have<br>you got diabetes an early organ or a man<br>and do you smoke or not and you figure<br>out what's your percentage risk of<br>having a heart attack in the next five<br>or ten years well they took this very<br>famous risk equation called a Framingham<br>equation and they applied it to people<br>over 85 and they found that it just<br>didn't work it just didn't predict heart<br>disease and how to text in the same way<br>as it does in younger people we also<br>know that the association between<br>cholesterol and death flattens as you<br>get to 70 minutes you reverses so the<br>deaths rate is higher and those with<br>lower with higher lower cholesterol in<br>with higher we know that lower blood<br>pressure is worse for you as you age and<br>we know that blood sugar targets that<br>are suitable and younger people aren't<br>and older people it seems that blood<br>sugar may have a protective effect<br>against fatigue and may help cells to<br>function as we age older age has many<br>more threats to physical and<br>psychological well-being than we can<br>capture by risk factor calculating and<br>disease rate to count counting these are<br>two wonderful paintings by Trevor<br>Moffitt who was my high school art<br>teacher here in Christchurch loneliness<br>are we further blushing what's a healthy<br>old age was medical care and introducing<br>ideas of risk that aren't really real<br>and we could have been really careful we<br>talk to people about risk as physicians<br>because when you introduce the concept<br>of risk it's like putting a drop of ink<br>and the clear water of a patient's<br>identity that water will never be quite<br>as clear again they will never think<br>about themselves in quite the same way<br>and I'm reminded that my whole journey<br>in fact was started by a patient of mine<br>many years ago I'll call him Mary Mary<br>was 92 and she used to come for her<br>driver's license so that she could take<br>milk meals on wheels to the elderly in<br>Mary we entered the hospital for just a<br>routine very minor procedure but the but<br>the enthusiastic house surgeon measured<br>her cholesterol while she was in<br>hospital and started on a<br>cholesterol-lowering pill and Mira was<br>never quite the same again because she<br>this is also this risk factor mongering<br>if you like is also fueled by the<br>pharmaceutical industry they label it<br>unmet need and if you want to know where<br>the next drug is coming from just<br>looking woman's magazines and look at<br>these screaming questionnaires for unmet<br>need do you have X condition and not<br>know it fill in this questionnaire<br>what's your score and this is my<br>favorite current example of unmet need<br>and this is a perfect storm really I'm<br>not a man but I forget that if you have<br>this problem you probably know about<br>but this is a perfect scenario if you<br>have this problem or we have the drug<br>for you but even if you don't think you<br>have this problem we still got the drug<br>many patients fear the way they're going<br>to die we all do more than death itself<br>and we all have quite clear preferences<br>about what we would see is a good death<br>and they will differ between us<br>so providing treatments designed to<br>prevent particular diseases at the point<br>at which we've reached a normal healthy<br>lifestyle we might be selecting for<br>another cause of death unknowingly and<br>certainly without patients consent a<br>patient's who's told if you take this<br>pill will reduce your risk of heart<br>attacks by 15 percent might assume<br>they'll live longer and healthier but if<br>they're also told well you'll increase<br>your risk of diagnosis of cancer or<br>death from cancer to the same extent<br>they might make a completely different<br>decision about that drug we have such a<br>richness of good medical care available<br>to us now that we're faced with this new<br>problem and patients priorities for care<br>are important part of sorting it out and<br>we know that patient priorities for care<br>are different from what we see as<br>medical priorities and that if we assume<br>that they're the same we may be<br>providing care that's intrusive and<br>unwanted I know that many people in this<br>room will have had the experience of<br>seeing someone near the end of their<br>life being taken off all the medications<br>as part of their terminal care in for<br>that patient to actually feel<br>substantially better the negative<br>effects of medicines they've been taken<br>for years are often not apparent until<br>we stop taking them once there's a trial<br>of stopping so what do we know about<br>stopping long term medicines we do know<br>that one of the barriers is the sense<br>that if there's a possibility of some<br>future benefit then we should probably<br>keep taking them it's certainly the<br>imperative that we have as prescribers<br>and it's useful to consider that<br>evidence for continuing to describe long<br>term and here's a fact that's not well<br>understood is that most people taking<br>meat long term minces aren't benefiting<br>from them because in order to benefit<br>there's a statistical figure called the<br>number needed to treat which means the<br>number needed to treat with a particular<br>medication for wound a benefit so in<br>order for at least half of people to be<br>benefiting from the long term medicines<br>they're taking the number needed to<br>treat needs to be two for one to benefit<br>in effect almost all of our current<br>disease medicines numbers needed to<br>treat are in the order of tens if not<br>hundreds of people for one to benefit in<br>hot off the presses this study which<br>shows that in fact medicines may not be<br>as magical as we think them to be only<br>about 10% of drugs that come on the<br>market are of clear benefit about a<br>quarter may be likely to offer some<br>benefit 7% or a toss-up between the<br>risks are the benefit and 50% we really<br>don't know actually if they're truly<br>effective we also know that even this<br>evidence is very much skewed towards<br>overstating the benefits and under<br>estimating the harms of medicines for a<br>number of reasons most of the trials are<br>commercially driven by the<br>pharmaceutical industry now and you've<br>seen one example of how the reporting<br>and bias creeps into results there's<br>often no it exists the raw data from<br>those trials for us to independently<br>verify the results and we know that when<br>we do get access to that raw data often<br>the results are quite different these<br>kind of results are also generated<br>through highly selected populations and<br>hospital based patients where people are<br>sicker and they're different from the<br>population of which we're using them in<br>primary care the trials usually exclude<br>people with multiple illnesses and they<br>exclude older patients and here's an<br>example of the kind of the way that bias<br>can creep in this is something called<br>publication bias now if you're a drug<br>company marketing a drug you don't want<br>to publish trial where it doesn't look<br>good it's only these published trials<br>that are available to us to summarize in<br>these sort of evidence-based medicine<br>summaries and this is an example from a<br>few years back of the trials of the<br>newer antidepressants and you can see<br>here that in the published trials they<br>look pretty good they look fairly<br>positive overall<br>and these are the trials that<br>underpinned and overall analysis to make<br>recommendations about treatment but this<br>doctor called Eric Tunis sat on the FDA<br>board and he got to see the trials that<br>weren't published or at least know about<br>them and he did some fusion around and<br>when you include the trials that weren't<br>published it's a different picture so<br>you can see how this kind of thing can<br>overestimate the benefits and<br>underestimate the harms of medicines so<br>leaping into the void of addressing<br>these kind of challenges the first<br>challenge is to make what seems to be in<br>action<br>look like action the art of not doing<br>well this is a quote from a psychiatrist<br>from our Paris who knew a lot about a<br>good care he was one of the psychiatrist<br>that was involved in freeing people from<br>their chains and the SA insane asylums<br>and this action has been given a name<br>cautionary prevention or p4 which means<br>preventing the potential harms that<br>medical care can carry and we need this<br>because our system is very much<br>predicated on doing things on doing<br>tests on adding treatments and measuring<br>things we add more and more treatments<br>to a patient through their lifetime in<br>our measures of quality care all about<br>how often we do things there are no<br>meters of care that revolve around not<br>doing things so because it's invertible<br>it's not valued and up until now we've<br>had not no framework really for doing<br>this these kinds of of reductions and<br>medical care but this is changing and<br>this is what is happening in the middle<br>for science around that we're now doing<br>trials of the effects of stopping long<br>term medicines so that patients and<br>doctors have some information on which<br>to base their decisions and here's an<br>example this is a trial we did a few<br>years ago where we took 70 70<br>consecutive older patients and we<br>trialed stopping and monitoring all the<br>non-life essential drugs to see if they<br>were still needed and you can see here<br>this p4 approach was highly six<br>we were able to discontinue an enormous<br>number of the medicines an enormous<br>burden of medicine in four out of five<br>cases they didn't have to be restarted<br>the original reason that people were on<br>them had disappeared and as you know you<br>know if you start on a blood-pressure<br>drug when you're 40 and carry on for 30<br>years often you won't have high blood<br>pressure by the time you sit into your<br>body shapes change your activity level<br>stripes change you're retired then<br>suddenly stretch that's stressful for<br>you but nobody knows unless you stop<br>because if your blood pressure's normal<br>we all think that it's the drug doing<br>its job and you don't need to read the<br>detail of this but this is just the<br>range of drugs that we were able to stop<br>so it's not just a few classes it's a<br>very broad range of drugs that it's<br>worth trialing pausing and monitoring<br>and having to restart isn't a failure<br>it's just good monitoring we've also<br>been doing trials of the effects of<br>stopping single medicines and long-term<br>uses and Roger Mulder who's sitting over<br>there and I were involved in a trial<br>just recently of of looking at people<br>who have been on newer antidepressants<br>prozac like drugs<br>long term as maintenance to prevent<br>depression recurrence this is what's<br>happened in New Zealand this is started<br>from Pharma can the blue line there you<br>can see is the rise and the prescription<br>of newer antidepressants over the years<br>and it's a stick rice this is very<br>similar to other countries and it's not<br>that more towards more people are being<br>put on them is that people are going on<br>and then staying on not stopping if you<br>walk outside the door here over ten<br>percent of the people that you meet<br>walking around will be taking on these<br>drugs at any one point in time which is<br>another extraordinary it's hard to think<br>that at any one point in time more than<br>10% of our population is so unwell from<br>a single diagnosis that they need to<br>take long term medicines for it and<br>there are concerns about the side<br>effects of this long term use which are<br>growing the emotional numbing that some<br>people experience others experience<br>to dysfunction poor sleep weight gain<br>this increased bleeding risk in an<br>increase in the race of Falls and death<br>and older adults effects on thinking<br>bone mineral density there's also a<br>tolerance that seems to develop and some<br>people when they've been on them a long<br>time and other people have real<br>withdrawal difficulties both physical<br>and psychological symptoms when they try<br>to stop these can often be mistaken for<br>a return of the original illness these<br>are the kinds of recommendations for<br>staying on treatment that come from<br>guidelines around the world and you can<br>see that well I'd certainly fit the<br>ongoing cycle social stressors category<br>most of the time I think you can see<br>that they're feeling loose in a large<br>group of people can be flipped into<br>these criteria and you can understand<br>why people carry on because I as a<br>doctor certainly don't want the patient<br>to have a recurrence of the depression<br>it's a horrible illness and the patient<br>doesn't want that either so it's just<br>easier to carry on because we don't<br>really have any evidence about what<br>stopping is likely to do but the trouble<br>is that most of the trials have long<br>around long term use of these medicines<br>and weren't really adequate first to<br>base our judgments on many were to<br>shorter duration they were to really in<br>the acute illness almost all trials were<br>done before the need for tapering was<br>known of these drugs many of these drugs<br>have quite acute withdrawal symptoms and<br>it's likely that a lot of those were<br>mistaken for return of the depression<br>and there was not a single trial done in<br>primary care which is where 90% of this<br>long-term medicines are prescribed in<br>the little figure down the bottom right<br>shows you what happens to the effect of<br>a drug when you change from a secondary<br>care population which is the blue line<br>to a primary care population was the red<br>dotted line the effect is much less so<br>we carried out a randomized trial where<br>we randomized we took a group of<br>patients who'd been on these medicines<br>long to him and someone for 20 years or<br>more and we randomized half of them<br>stay on the medicine and half to taper<br>off to a placebo pill everybody was<br>taking pink pills nobody knew who was in<br>which hour and we had 330 people<br>participating this from Christchurch<br>Wellington and Nelson in effect a third<br>of people who are eligible to be in the<br>trial who are on these long term<br>medicines volunteered to participate and<br>it's an extraordinarily high number for<br>a clinical trial and I've highlighted in<br>red because I think that that reflects<br>the appetite and the need to do these<br>kind of trials that people are very<br>interested in what's going to happen<br>what might happen if I tried to stop him<br>and we followed and looked to see what<br>the rate of depression was over the next<br>18 months now every trial has its<br>difficulties an hour certainly had a<br>major difficulty in the middle of it we<br>had the earthquakes and and our data was<br>buried in the orange building to the S&amp;L<br>no court for some time however we<br>persisted in so did patients patients<br>turned up the day after the earthquake<br>for their appointment and said well you<br>don't think I'm going to give up now do<br>you so this is what we saw over 18<br>months we saw and those who continued on<br>their antidepressants<br>eleven percent still got an episode of<br>depression and those who tape it off<br>23 percent had an episode of depression<br>so the difference in recurrences the<br>benefit of the actual medicine was about<br>one in eight people who've benefited<br>over the 18 months of the trial in the<br>majority of the difference that we still<br>saw was in their early period so if<br>you've got to get a recurrence that's<br>going to happen early on after you try<br>stopping a medicine<br>we also found interestingly that one in<br>sixteen people couldn't actually stop<br>even with tapering because the<br>withdrawal symptoms were so paired yes<br>this is important kind of information<br>for patients to know when they start<br>taking these medicines and that one in<br>ten patients wanted to start with the<br>act that medication again not because<br>they had signs of depression or<br>returning or withdrawal symptoms but<br>well patients were thought if they tried<br>stopping well no they weren't had 18<br>months there was no difference between<br>those who tried stopping and those who<br>continued in any measure that's<br>important to patients whether it remove<br>functioning in your job social<br>functioning so at the end of the trial<br>we found that half of people taking<br>these medicines long to him and could<br>quite successfully stopped without<br>recurrence of the depression without<br>significant withdrawal symptoms or other<br>reasons to need to go back on the drug<br>and this is the kind of people the<br>information that people need to make<br>decisions about whether they should<br>continue medicines whether they should<br>stop and each individual make a<br>different decision just depending on on<br>how the odds look to them but this is<br>what we need to try in and really reduce<br>this burden of long term medicines and<br>the community and for our population<br>does anyone know what this is yeah it's<br>the Large Hadron Collider and I think<br>that that this these possibilities offer<br>us something as exciting in the<br>breakthrough and the practice of<br>medicine is the Large Hadron Collider<br>and it's a bit similar because we kind<br>of know what we've got to do we kind of<br>know how it's going to happen but we<br>don't know exactly what's going to<br>happen and the longer-run but we do know<br>that partnering with patients is a key<br>part of it if we have a patient on 15<br>medicines all of them with good evidence<br>none of them inappropriate they might<br>all offer benefits but the burden of<br>them all together is too great<br>like those different threads of music<br>beautiful on your own but woven together<br>they make a cacophony for the patient<br>then it's patient priorities that need<br>to lead the decisions and patients do<br>have widely varying priorities for their<br>health and for their lives and I've<br>always loved this quote from Sol<br>Theodore Fox it was an exhibitor of The<br>Lancet but if you look in your own<br>clinical record your electronic record<br>you'll see a lot there about diseases<br>and measurements and treatments but<br>you'll see nothing about patient<br>priorities<br>here and we need ways of making sure<br>that patient priorities that equally<br>important part of evidence-based<br>medicine are routinely sought and<br>recorded that we include them in our of<br>four letters to each other so you don't<br>have to retell your story every time and<br>there are communications both to you in<br>to other doctors now these wonderful and<br>energy that young people have just a<br>search of the research literature across<br>the globe looking for tools to help and<br>boy they needed energy because they did<br>an enormous amount of work you can see<br>from the top down combing through<br>hundreds of papers to find examples of<br>ways for bringing patient priorities<br>into medical care in a meaningful way<br>and what they found after all this work<br>and all the searching was they found one<br>study of at all that was suitable for<br>use for making patient priorities<br>physical and medical care and even that<br>tall didn't report on any effect on<br>patient important outcomes or health<br>outcomes so we talked a lot about<br>patients into medicine and patient<br>priorities but actually it's a bit of a<br>castle in the Year at the moment and we<br>really need to do a lot of work to make<br>this much more visible and medical here<br>so what we did next was we went to<br>patients to ask them what their<br>experiences had been of having their<br>priorities incorporated into making<br>decisions on the medicines what had<br>worked for them in that sense and what<br>hadn't and this is what we found that<br>that most people do want to have<br>discussions about stopping medicines if<br>they can but they may not have got very<br>far in these discussions this is a<br>Canadian and population there's no<br>framework for this care so they said you<br>have to be assertive to initiate these<br>kinds of conferences conversations we<br>know that doctors also say they find<br>initiating these kind of conversations<br>hard they don't want to communicate to<br>the patient that they're somehow no<br>longer worth it and they don't know how<br>to get into this trip tricky area of<br>priorities for care just continue your<br>so what happened was patients did it to<br>self experiment on their own well this<br>is not great when this kind of situation<br>arises so we need a better way to have<br>these conversations and we've been<br>working hard on this based on what these<br>groups of patients have told us working<br>hard on a tool that might help to to<br>start the conversation between doctors<br>and patients and bring these priorities<br>and preferences into a systematic way of<br>reducing the burden of treatment or<br>polypharmacy we've also been working<br>hard on putting tools into patients and<br>Families hands because there's no one<br>more interested than the medications<br>they're taking that a patient or the<br>patient's family now this is a website<br>risk shuttle that we've formed as a<br>collaboration between researchers here<br>and the UK in Canada and in the US where<br>people can check interactions and<br>side-effects for themselves they can<br>figure out if a drug might be causing a<br>side effect and get a report to take to<br>the doctor to start that conversation<br>and this website is now getting a<br>these tools to help prescribers and<br>patients have these conversations we<br>hope will help them recognize drug side<br>effects<br>we know that the commonest health look<br>up on the Internet is looking for a drug<br>name and a side-effect name and the<br>second most common is people looking for<br>blogs looking for other people's stories<br>of side effects to see if they match<br>what they are experiencing so we've<br>tried to incorporate both those things<br>into this website and we were interested<br>in trying to find solutions helping<br>support the teamwork between prescriber<br>doctor pharmacist and patient around<br>polypharmacy and helping all three to<br>work out whether they might be on too<br>many drugs or could benefit from a lower<br>dose of some of their drugs questions to<br>ask before making a decision to start a<br>medicine in several thousand people have<br>now used this polypharmacy risk at all<br>and we're just following the app to see<br>how useful they found it and what the<br>outcomes were in terms of the<br>conversations that they had so there's a<br>pressing need to reverse the current<br>trend towards the management of<br>individual diseases and silos of care<br>so that care of patients with multiple<br>illnesses which is the most common<br>scenario that we see is much more<br>closely driven by patients priorities<br>and patients experience of illness and<br>treatments if through the more<br>healthcare systems need to start to<br>value and provide adequate support for<br>the necessary variation that this<br>entails to paly policymakers variation<br>in healthcare is there kind of a duty<br>worth that in profit implies variable<br>quality but variation is essential and<br>translating the partial statistical<br>lives of these trial populations into<br>the real lives of people with multiple<br>illnesses ind into the kind of person<br>focused care that looks at the context<br>of a patient's life and their priorities<br>over time to make decisions on health<br>care that's best for them are we brave<br>enough to move from our comfort zone to<br>address this it'll take some nerve and<br>some courage because it's an<br>uncomfortable space for us to move into<br>moving away from the safety of just<br>following the guidelines this art of not<br>doing well will place equal value on<br>making complex decisions not to give<br>treatment not to order tests and to stop<br>current treatments and we're an<br>improvement in the health status of the<br>patient must be seen not as an end in<br>itself but as the means to fulfillment<br>and possibility in the life of the<br>individual which is not related to<br>diseases and their numbers and measures<br>but is related to what healthcare can do<br>to maximize each individual's potential<br>with minimal disruption minimally<br>disruptive medicine is a term that's<br>been coined by a Brazilian doctor now<br>working at Harvard University called<br>Victor Montori a system that values the<br>most important outcome for all of us<br>which is a life worth living so I thank<br>you to the School of Medicine here in in<br>all of you for listening in and giving<br>me the opportunity to hear these issues<br>and I'll be very interested<br>and the discussions that you have around<br>this kind of exciting opportunity that I<br>think we have as we move forward and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
