identity<br>theft fraud and harassment every time we<br>connect to the internet at home at<br>school at work and elsewhere or on our<br>mobile devices we make decisions that<br>affect our cyber security what's being<br>done to prevent cyber crime what can we<br>do to protect us protect our ourselves<br>effectively and can laws of privacy and<br>transnational law be applied to cyber<br>crime when it's just so complicated to<br>administer today you may get some<br>options and some answers from our panel<br>of three we've got Dr Ryan Co he's a<br>senior lecturer with the computer<br>science department at wer University he<br>researches cyber security cloud data<br>Providence applied cryptography and<br>cloud computing security and trust he<br>heads the cyber security researchers of<br>yat commonly known as Crow and serves as<br>the science leader in the 12.23 million<br>Mimi funded Stratus project next to him<br>is associate professor Wang Rambles he's<br>Dean at the faculty of law at the<br>University of w he teaches and<br>researches in the areas of cyber law law<br>and new technologies criminal law with a<br>focus on cyber crime and he teaches with<br>Dr Dr Crow and New Zealand's first<br>masters of cyber security here at<br>wo and then we have Jeff Gary He's a<br>doctoral student at the University of wo<br>and computer science and a recent RoR as<br>an um intern at Interpol a current<br>security challenge for mobile platform<br>users is lack of security situation<br>awareness features that could alert them<br>to security events and so Jeff is<br>searching for methods that can help<br>users understand security events through<br>visualizations easily and efficiently<br>and he'll explain more about what that<br>means as we go on Ryan if we can start<br>with you you know is cyber crime as<br>right as we've been led to believe yes<br>uh in fact the size of the entire cyber<br>crime you will call it an industry the<br>size of the impact of cyber crime is not<br>larger than the size of few truck uh<br>traffic around the world so this was a<br>survey done by n behind the antivirus in<br>2012 they were mentioning that size of C<br>crime is now has now overtaken<br>trafficking of heroin marijuana and um<br>all the Opium related drugs in the world<br>um every day you get about more than 100<br>uh cyber crime incidents in New Zealand<br>every day and um it's very common to see<br>different attacks um attacking high<br>profile people all the way to the common<br>F daily so yeah that's the that's the<br>overview of what we're facing right now<br>so you've got you know like you say<br>high-profile organizations being<br>attacked um and obviously individual<br>users what sort of things happen to them<br>in the attacks so usually they um um now<br>we're seeing more sophisticated attacks<br>we're seeing more um fishing attacks for<br>example they will send attackers will<br>send you an email that looks like<br>something you would expect or from<br>someone you would expect for example<br>like your boss your manager your bank<br>yeah and your bank uh or maybe even your<br>your school you know an organization<br>that you're expecting it looks exactly<br>like the same um same email except that<br>the the URL the hyperlink on the email<br>actually leads to a a malicious website<br>which uh which then starts to steal your<br>information for example it can lead you<br>to a fake uh Google login page which<br>looks exactly like the the main the real<br>one except that you're now keying your<br>login information into a fake website<br>and after you press enter nothing<br>happens and then you you suddenly<br>realize that oh no there something wrong<br>with that but it's too late they've got<br>your details they got your details yeah<br>and then from there it takes just one<br>person in your organization so sometimes<br>they could send an organization email<br>saying that there's a massive uh<br>retrenchment or<br>reorganization staff are laid off you<br>know those kind of alarming news they<br>they'll be they'll be capturing the<br>attention of at least one person in your<br>organization and it just takes one<br>person to click on that link and after<br>that when the information is<br>stolen the the hackers will then start<br>to take control of the entire<br>organization it's not uncommon uh in<br>fact a few years ago Associated Press uh<br>one of the prominent um news uh agencies<br>was attacked in such a way<br>where the account that was managing the<br>Twitter account for Associated Press was<br>being taken over and then the hackers<br>actually went in to to say that the<br>president of the United States was<br>attacked in the uh White House at that<br>on that day and then that fake tweet<br>actually resulted in the drop of the Dow<br>Jones uh Industrial Average so I see the<br>impact on such a thing absolutely um it<br>seems it makes criminal law seem quite<br>straightforward by comparison how do you<br>devise law around cyber crime so I guess<br>there's three ways that uh that the<br>legal uh system has responded to that<br>one is to make specific uh changes to<br>the law to have like we have in the<br>Crimes Act we've got sections that um<br>against unauthorized access or um as you<br>more commonly called attacking um and<br>those sections are specifically targeted<br>towards um online online criminal<br>activity uh we have other areas such as<br>the electronics transaction act which um<br>also targets activity online and makes<br>it equivalent to those off<br>offline uh and more recently we've had<br>the harmful digital Communications act<br>which is not fully enforced yet but um<br>is to deal with uh the kind of crossing<br>over between uh antisocial Behavior to<br>Criminal Behavior online so that's one<br>way is to make specific laws uh the<br>other way is to modify the<br>interpretation of current laws which<br>we've done in the areas of fraud for<br>example um most fraud um sections in the<br>in in criminal sections deal with uh<br>using a document for example a document<br>to Def fraud or a document for to gain a<br>pecuniary Advantage so our courts over<br>time um as as the internet has become<br>more PR<br>have interpreted a document to include<br>um a piece of software that you download<br>off the internet will also be considered<br>documented a document is something that<br>um is is described and can be um<br>recovered and so they've decided code is<br>the way of recording the content and it<br>can be recovered and used um to reflect<br>so therefore software is a document so<br>therefore they've interpreted the law to<br>fit the new environment and then there's<br>other areas where we still have to catch<br>up the law still has to catch up uh<br>copyright is a good example for that<br>copyright um is really constructed<br>around an offline world where you've got<br>Publications perhaps even um uh video<br>recordings but it isn't really set up to<br>cope specifically with an online<br>environment where pretty much everything<br>you do is copying have we seen many<br>cases come before the courts have we<br>seen many convictions uh yes there's a<br>number of convictions um in New Zealand<br>um convictions the actual convictions<br>tend to be at the lower end of the of<br>the scale uh and um but there has been a<br>a growing number of jurist prudence<br>around especially around unauthorized<br>access and the fraud sections um we're<br>still to see how um the handful digital<br>Communications acts but there has been a<br>number it's been at least six um revenge<br>porn um convictions under the handful<br>digital Communications X um the last six<br>months Jeff can you tell us what your<br>research is about because it can involve<br>sort of law enforcement agencies can't<br>it um yes um my research is busy excuse<br>me it's basically um security<br>visualization for mobile platforms we've<br>see nowadays the attacks are more<br>directed towards mobile users so um<br>because it's becoming one of the main<br>focus uh putting a a situation awareness<br>into mobile platforms of interest uh the<br>idea is to provide a method or a<br>technique that could actually alert<br>users whenever there's a security EV for<br>example a mobile banking proam which<br>attacks a specific user how can that<br>user um near real time understand and<br>know that he's been or she's been<br>attacked so that is the area of um<br>research um in terms of uh law<br>enforcement um again they are more<br>concerned about attribution back to the<br>attack and because uh social media those<br>type of applications are used basically<br>over mobile platforms uh they feel that<br>that is one of the areas which they<br>could use and attack at those types of<br>attacks and they interested in um<br>actually using that to actually identify<br>um uh for example truly the fishing<br>attacks which U leads onto a bigger<br>crime scenes such as organized Crim<br>which of more interest to them which<br>again leads to um Bitcoin currencies and<br>everything so that is some of the<br>specifics where um the research goes<br>into and reason to that is that<br>visualization is U has a a broader way<br>of actually providing situation<br>awareness to users uh basically the end<br>users and it can be used to actually<br>facilitate information exchange and<br>sharing among the law enforcement<br>overall it's uh the idea is to keep the<br>receive the data the underlying data but<br>actually use visualization to explain uh<br>some certain form of attacks which are<br>happening over the inter okay now we've<br>had some questions come in um this is<br>from Lucas who says I know it wi but I<br>know enough code to understand the<br>various methods talking around it seems<br>to be effectively impossible to secure<br>digital products the best advice I got<br>was that if it's copyable it's hackable<br>so rather than trying to fortify we<br>should play nice and give would be<br>hackers reasons to protect us does that<br>make sense to<br>you um yeah I mean the it's um the the<br>question uh the person writing the<br>question thank thank you for that uh I<br>think made a good point that it's<br>impossible to fully secure a digital uh<br>product or information um because<br>there's always some kind of security<br>lole that someone will find and it's<br>always a cat and mouse game uh the most<br>important I think prevention that one<br>can perhaps look at is to uh have first<br>the awareness uh the the weakest link in<br>the society right now is not about the<br>lack of tools or that that can help big<br>organizations like the government<br>agencies or the banks but the biggest<br>Gap are the tools that can help everyday<br>users so most of us would have no<br>knowledge about how to help ourselves in<br>in in in this kind of situations for<br>example you probably uh most of us would<br>probably not have an idea of how to help<br>ourselves if we find out that we are<br>being hacked no yeah so what would I do<br>yeah so so this is the the kind of uh<br>tools that we need right so as much as<br>you can secure your house if you can<br>secure your house you put your you know<br>Security Alarms or cctvs and so on those<br>are the the things that you can do to<br>empower yourself sometimes even the<br>cctvs connected to your mobile phone and<br>you can see what's going on on your<br>house maybe in another uh geographical<br>location but for the cyers space we<br>don't have such tools yeah we don't have<br>such tools to empower all of us you know<br>everyday lives and and that's that's<br>that's a right right statement um<br>it is now also starting to become a<br>trend where most of the researchers and<br>the practitioners in every aspect of the<br>industry assume that<br>data uh the systems will always be be<br>insecure yeah so that's that's that's<br>the general assumption that's why<br>there's a recent focus on cryptography<br>instead so because if you can secure the<br>data no matter which area that it passes<br>or where it's St if it stays encrypted<br>and can only be turned on by the user<br>themselves then it's more secure than<br>trusting the pipes that that are<br>processing the data so that's I hope<br>that answers the question I think I<br>understand you want to pick up on that<br>so um I think around uh you can have<br>really good laws sitting behind um so<br>I'd argue that our our hacking laws are<br>pretty in terms of way they're<br>constructed are very good um compared<br>across across internationally but um if<br>you have someone who um either leads<br>their front door open um or if you've<br>got a manufacturer of an alarm that then<br>um has a key to that alarm that allows<br>all criminals to access that um that's<br>where we're like where where we're at at<br>the moment with um with network kind of<br>environment is that there isn't really<br>an obligation on the providers of<br>products to secure their their um their<br>product other than to try keep their<br>reputation um but we also have um the<br>users who have very little um knowledge<br>of what they're doing so therefore they<br>basically leave their um networks<br>exposed so there has to be can have good<br>laws um but you need people to be able<br>the resources to enforce those laws and<br>you need to have an obligation on the on<br>the suppliers of the product to um<br>secure the the assistance that they're<br>selling to the public do you think it'd<br>be a good idea then to have a at a sort<br>of a national public awareness campaign<br>I know they've done that in the states<br>and we have awareness campaigns for a<br>lot of other social issues so would it<br>be a good idea to do that here yes<br>definitely in fact they have been doing<br>that for a few years now yes they have<br>so there is a national cyber policy<br>office uh set up uh with the Department<br>of prime minister and cabinet so they<br>have created an awareness campaign uh<br>called connect smart and connect smart<br>is an initiative that's led by the<br>ncpo uh to to to equip um they started<br>from equipping um daily users and small<br>and medium Enterprises because of the<br>small and medium Enterprises form about<br>97% of our economy so so they started to<br>Target and uh they so far the uh the<br>campaigns have been quite effective they<br>created uh so you know um I think the<br>audience if they are next to a a a<br>browser you know they can serf for Tool<br>kits with the connect smart initiative<br>they they could they could download the<br>PDF and there's a checklist of people to<br>actually equip themselves with risk<br>management so that it there's a lot more<br>to be done you know we we should get<br>into schools we should get into uh the<br>public sector you know we could even<br>have posters everywhere to remind people<br>to lock their screens when they are not<br>at their desk for example it's a bit<br>like those wash your hands campaign and<br>prev the flu kind of campaigns<br>so so any anything to add from Jeff and<br>I I would also think um such awareness<br>to school should be a very good<br>direction to head towards because um<br>kids learn quite fast and for example if<br>there's an i in front they just click<br>click but giving such awareness um once<br>they do something they learn from that<br>and they sort of like share information<br>at a very rapid rate so giving awareness<br>would be very helpful we could have<br>cyber security awareness month do you<br>think yeah that would be great and uh we<br>have to raise awareness in several form<br>I mean uh for example there there is the<br>border security and border patrol kind<br>of shows right that they used to educate<br>people about uh the biocurity of the<br>country we could even have you know uh<br>shows on TV that tells people about the<br>basic uh threats that they they face you<br>know or uh we could also empower the<br>awareness of techy guys you know people<br>who are technologically inclined or they<br>they might have an interest in this area<br>and show them some form of uh an Avenue<br>to understand better so that's why we<br>have the New Zealand cyber security<br>challenge for example to raise awareness<br>amongst the technically inclined people<br>as well and I agree with r that we any<br>any um awareness campaign has to be<br>multi leveled uh has to be targeted at<br>um businesses so they they change the<br>culture within within a work environment<br>um people are used to being able to um<br>be always online take their own devices<br>to work which can creates um security<br>issues and and there needs to be a<br>raising awareness at that level uh there<br>needs to be um and I think we we we're<br>getting there in terms of the kind of<br>infrastructure and government um<br>awareness um but uh the weakest link is<br>still the average user at home yes um if<br>they if they um let um if they if they<br>don't keep their own network secure then<br>therefore they make other um networks<br>vulnerable we are only as secure as the<br>weakest link of our whole W yeah nicely<br>put do you think there's any value W in<br>cyber Insurance uh cyber Insurance um<br>like any insurance um you have to read<br>the the the terms of the insurance<br>because it'll only cover specifically<br>what is in there um I think cyber<br>Insurance depending on U what are the<br>risks to your um your either your<br>business um it does have some value um<br>it is still a very new um um type of<br>insurance and I think the the market<br>still needs to mature uh and but there<br>is some value I think in terms of<br>especially if um your your business is<br>is dependent on a networked environment<br>um do we know where the majority of<br>cyber criminals are based or is that<br>impossible to know um it's a yes and a<br>no kind of question because uh you can<br>tell where the servers are but the<br>technology has now evolved to such a<br>state where a server that's in country a<br>could be controlled by someone sitting<br>in country B and or maybe it's a server<br>controlled by a country B server<br>controlled by country C server by a guy<br>sitting in country D so we've had a we a<br>case here in New Zealand where uh chap<br>here up in up in in New Zealand was<br>using service through the Pacific and uh<br>triggering through um the Netherlands<br>and actually attacking a a a<br>Pennsylvania<br>University and so if you find if you<br>find the criminal whose laws are they<br>charged under so uh so depending on<br>which which jurisdiction where they're<br>located um there will be a there will be<br>a contest so in that example I just<br>talked about both there was the<br>Netherlands uh the American and and New<br>Zealand all had technically jurisdiction<br>over the<br>case uh in that particular case they<br>negotiated um and came to an agreement<br>that that that person were prosecuted in<br>New Zealand um but you can see areas um<br>such as um U Mr McKinnon in the UK or<br>our own Mr Doom here where you've got<br>contest between jurisdictions and<br>prosecute them they need to be<br>extradited so um it it is a comp<br>complicated area in terms of to to<br>assert jurisdiction um and but there is<br>processes in the courts sometimes they<br>take a long time they sure do and<br>sometimes it's a poit ends up being a<br>political decision rather than a legal<br>one got um I don't know if this is your<br>area of expertise but from now way why<br>does Facebook always ask me to change my<br>name or provide a birth certificate is<br>that normal oh that doesn't happen to<br>the B of Facebook users it only happens<br>if you are Facebook suspects that your<br>account uh is facing some potential<br>identity theft so it might be a good<br>idea if you are more um aware of who has<br>access to your accounts is it well<br>secure or you could just shut down the<br>account all together and create a new<br>one yeah because sometimes the the<br>request for the the identity is<br>genuinely the proof that you are indeed<br>that person however it could also be a<br>malicious uh screen where we have seen<br>cases of they call it uh click jacking<br>where where um on the legitimate uh<br>Facebook page you can also see<br>malicious uh screens that pop up and ask<br>you for information which don't belong<br>on with Facebook but you will then enter<br>in because you think that because it has<br>a blue color theme and it looks legit<br>with the same font like key something so<br>my advice to the user would be to<br>probably to start a brand<br>new Facebook page I hope that was useful<br>now<br>I um another question I recently saw a<br>YouTube video from Canada where two<br>Factor SMS authentication was<br>compromised via identity fraud somehow<br>the attacker convinced a mobile provider<br>to send a replacement SIM card how can<br>we tell how well equipped our<br>telecomunication providers are to handle<br>something like<br>this um would you guys want<br>to or yeah I mean there's been a number<br>of cases where and and it's like what<br>Ryan said before the it's the weakest<br>link so if you if you have an operator<br>who um will reset someone's password for<br>example um and do that over the over the<br>line without following the protocols<br>that have been set in place for that<br>business then um that that's compromises<br>compromises that and same with here I'm<br>sure the um actual Telco had protocols<br>on about sending out a replacement um<br>Sim to make sure that they were sending<br>it to the to the identity but in this<br>particular case um perhaps the operator<br>or the person that were contacted um<br>didn't follow those procedures so again<br>it's the weakest link in terms of in<br>terms of the um access to the network<br>yeah we're also seeing this uh so two<br>Factor authentication yes uh there has<br>been certain reports about The protocol<br>being compromised but at the same time<br>it is the most effective method so far<br>and and is stronger than uh pass plane<br>password entry so it actually weats out<br>maybe 80% of the attacks and you know it<br>kind of save the Manpower and man hours<br>that's involved to solve<br>potential breaches without a two Factor<br>authentication in place yeah yeah and<br>that say that also points to one of the<br>things that I was mentioning earlier the<br>users are not empowered with the ability<br>to know so in this case even if you're<br>belonging to or you're subscribing to<br>Telco you don't have the tools to tell<br>whether your your account was<br>compromised or connection is compromised<br>and that is the the the main goal of our<br>lab and our Stratus project which is to<br>return control of data to users I was<br>going to say can you talk a little bit<br>about the stratus program because it's<br>be funded yes yeah so uh strus is an MBI<br>funded project uh it's a science<br>investment project is about 12 million<br>for six years our main goal is to create<br>a made in New Zealand DIY security tools<br>for users of the cloud for users uh with<br>uh internet connction ction so in the<br>security space you see a lot of tools<br>that are made by vendors uh for vendors<br>you know so so if I'm I'm a large<br>company and I can afford you know to to<br>to get the Security Experts and the<br>techniques and the technology to come<br>and protect me but how about the<br>everyday users so that's what strs is<br>trying to do we're trying to increase<br>Research into potentially creating new<br>products in the form of uh there are<br>four main research aims the first one is<br>to understand what has happened to your<br>data and number two is to can we protect<br>the data and it stays<br>encrypted and process it while it stays<br>encrypted so uh it's actually not<br>possible to do that right now encrypted<br>data has to be decrypted at some point<br>of time number three can we know what<br>happened so this is where uh Jeff's<br>research comes in his research falls<br>under the the C object<br>awareness real time awareness can we<br>know what happened if we know what<br>happened can we have the ability to stop<br>what's happening if I know that my my my<br>photo on a social media account is being<br>maliciously uh accessed by someone who's<br>working in that company and they have<br>the admin rights but they're not my<br>friend but they're looking at my my<br>photos for example I would be able to<br>know that it happened and I can stop it<br>or can revocate the actions and number<br>four is a doomsday scenario where<br>everything just goes down and can we<br>actually uh come back quickly back to<br>business again you know websites like<br>trade me for example is totally<br>dependent on the web shop front and<br>every minute that they are down actually<br>is uh money loss okay yeah so so that's<br>that's what strugles is trying to do so<br>that's that's the that's the goal our<br>goal is by 2020 New Zealand is known for<br>DIY secur TOS so how's it going so far<br>so far has been quite quite good uh we<br>are now having some industry Partners<br>who are now trying to commercialize some<br>of our inventions and our Innovations so<br>we have some uh we have about four<br>industry Partners who are working with<br>us and also we have the yhp and the<br>police working with us as<br>well and one of the areas is with um<br>trying to prosecute people who have made<br>security be is that we of it's often<br>hard to tell what they actually did the<br>steps and you need those those you need<br>those um steps to be able to um present<br>its evidence in court so um this also<br>feeds into successful prosecution is you<br>need the evidence to be able to prose<br>the more detail the better yeah yes so<br>one of the the first a with what has<br>happened to your data we are actually<br>tracking what actually uh changes the<br>create of the file for example the the<br>reading of the file the opening all<br>those little little actions can be<br>recorded in a very high integrity form<br>which then be can become a digital<br>evidence for for the use of c and that's<br>our goal provide those kind of<br>accountability maybe I can also let Jeff<br>describe a little bit more about his<br>visualization as um with the terms of<br>visualization um the idea behind that is<br>actually to also preserve the data which<br>at the end um if it gets admitted to the<br>court but the actual Ro data is there<br>but what you're visualizing it is less<br>detailed but very simple for um the JS<br>for example or the audience to actually<br>look at it and understand that oh there<br>there's an attack and this is the source<br>this is the destination so it kind of<br>portrays information in a clear sense<br>that will actually help um users and in<br>terms of law enforcement um contribution<br>back to the source of the<br>ATT so the goal is to make it easy for<br>someone to understand what went on cuz<br>right now if you look at all the cyber<br>security tools in terms of visualizing<br>data you see things flying around yes<br>yeah but but you can't do anything about<br>them right so so the goal is for us to<br>show not just things flying around but<br>where is the exact problem and what is<br>actually happen can we can we do<br>something about it quickly can we call<br>the right person to stop it and also in<br>some sense giving the control to the<br>user to actually visualize a set event<br>on any given time that is interested so<br>you're actually empowering the user and<br>giving it instead of reading a whole um<br>set of data locks which are very<br>complicated and quite lot um that lock<br>is transformed into visualization which<br>you just click maybe SW have a look at<br>it you know pictures Pi a th000 which<br>better to understand than reading whole<br>lot of LS<br>seems to me a lot of what you're saying<br>sort of comes down to educating people<br>yeah to to take care of their own<br>security as well as developing systems<br>that are good at detecting flaws in the<br>system you like but um do are are there<br>what do your teach say on your masters<br>of cyber security that are producing<br>graduates that can kind of work in this<br>field yeah so uh Jeff is actually the<br>first graduate of the master of cyber<br>security program so uh the master's<br>degree is a multidisciplinary degree it<br>has both the technical aspects and the<br>legal aspects as well so um what do we<br>teach there uh in basically in three<br>different uh areas one is uh preventive<br>preventative approaches the other one is<br>understanding what is the offensive<br>approaches and then the Third is to know<br>how to defend yeah which is the much<br>needed capability right now how can we<br>defend ourselves yeah so um recently<br>there was I think there was the cyber<br>security challenge yes what was that<br>about yeah the cyber security challenge<br>is uh it's it's actually a uh a<br>competition it's a national competition<br>that we open up to uh people of all ages<br>so we had about uh close to 26 67<br>participants online so they will come<br>into uh we have we set up a website<br>where they can try to test their cyber<br>security skills and then they'll qualify<br>to be the top 150 to come here and the<br>whole goal of it right is to identify<br>Talent is to bridge the gap between<br>industry and uh the uh the schools<br>because we have a lot of bright talent<br>in in New Zealand but you know some<br>sometimes they might not know what are<br>the potential career paths ahead or they<br>might not have the chance to network<br>with experts from the industry and vice<br>versa yeah so before the challenge<br>itself we actually have a series of<br>talks and a career fair as well so you<br>can get to see the different aspects of<br>the the Cyber uh security industry<br>that's from policym all the way to being<br>a penetration tester yeah so so I hope<br>it addresses a gap worldwide we we see a<br>lot of um you know kind of over<br>glorification of the the dark side you<br>know we see yes hackers right being<br>glorified uh the goal of the cyber<br>security challenge is to show that<br>there's actually a lot of potential<br>joining the the light you know the the<br>good<br>side yeah and you can see a lot of<br>potential career Avenues there so that's<br>what we are trying to promote uh it's<br>interesting to note that uh the first<br>prize Was Won by an industry group uh<br>from G and the second prize was also<br>very interesting because the national<br>champion was a 17 year old yeah from<br>Cambridge High so yeah and he did very<br>well he was a oneman oneman team uh<br>against uh real real real<br>industry Security Professionals who are<br>trying to take down his service but he<br>was able to defend them very well so<br>there there's of Hope actually we saw<br>that well this<br>is and I think the other aspect of the<br>cyber security challenge is that we<br>collected data uh because we uh we don't<br>have uh a lot of chances where a company<br>which was had would share the data with<br>us with researchers uh Jeff was a key<br>member of the data collection team maybe<br>I'll yeah another aspect to the sub<br>security challeng is as resarch we need<br>some form of data to actually car<br>resarch and um test data is very<br>important and because getting data from<br>different companies is quite difficult<br>in<br>their policies and regulations in that<br>um coming up with this hyp security<br>challenge allows us to actually simulate<br>our own scenarios and also collect data<br>from that and later on use those data to<br>actually cage and maybe understand<br>behaviors or patterns of attacks which<br>could lead to useful forms of research<br>and hopefully contribute to what we are<br>doing here so yeah that I said it's<br>quite important as absolutely so we keep<br>coming back to education and I guess<br>we've got to educate the lawyers as well<br>have we got specialist lawyers in cyber<br>security well I've been teaching in the<br>area of cyber law for um the last 14<br>years or so so um there's there's a<br>number of graduates have come out and<br>many of those are now um situated in in<br>some of our major firms with throughout<br>the country and working in the it I I'm<br>I it cyber space now so that that's<br>that's very exciting um the master of<br>cyber security I think is um is one of<br>the most exciting things we're doing<br>because I said in the class when I teach<br>my um class half of them will be law<br>students how can they be computer<br>science students is that a happy<br>marriage takes a few it takes a few<br>weeks to get there but um it is a happy<br>marriage um because the computer science<br>in the legal sphere the computer science<br>students um will play a very major role<br>in terms of being uh expert Witnesses<br>within the court and being able to<br>explain to an average user um in simple<br>language that fits the legal legal<br>Paradigm um what has gone on and that is<br>so essential we need we need more um<br>expert Witnesses and also the lawyers<br>and they sitting in there that they can<br>at least have a basic understanding of<br>the Network Technologies and um be able<br>to then um present that to the court in<br>a way that um the judge or the jury are<br>going to be a understand um so education<br>is a key and um increasingly we are<br>bringing people on uh we have two new<br>experts joining us and um next month and<br>in the Cyber area so uh W will be a hub<br>of um sort of cyber law for the country<br>well think sounds good that we might be<br>leading the way there um I probably I<br>think we have chatted long enough unless<br>there's something else you wouldd like<br>to add I think sort of in summary we can<br>say that yes um cyber crime is right<br>that we could be doing more ourselves<br>particularly domestic users and<br>protecting ourselves and perhaps<br>nationally we need to be um much more<br>conscious of educating people in cyber<br>security is there anything else you'd<br>like I think one thing to think about<br>when you thinking about cyber crime<br>because cyber crime now um covers a lot<br>of other areas of CRI crime so so so you<br>can think of even even so um sort of<br>drug area people are using uh tablets to<br>maintain their um list of users and um<br>to set up meetings or using Virtual<br>Worlds to to transfer money um<br>so cyber crime is becoming um<br>infiltrating to all other areas of of<br>crime as well so I think one day uh in<br>the not too distant future you won't<br>have<br>uh cyber crime as a kind of unit but<br>it'll be cyber crime dealing with theft<br>cyber crime dealing with fraud cyber<br>crime offenses against the person for<br>example so um it's it's it's not going<br>to go away and it's only going to become<br>G to expand but we will gradually adapt<br>that's right it'll it'll it'll it'll be<br>part of our whole um social and um legal<br>artment yeah there are three men uh this<br>a very huge gap right say right um there<br>is a statistic that that is quite<br>interesting is that um every half a<br>second a new militia software is being<br>created a new virus or worm is being<br>created every half a second and you know<br>when you think about this how can we<br>address or train enough uh yeah<br>professionals at the rate of every half<br>a second yeah so so there definitely a<br>multi-prong approach you know we we have<br>to not just train the the people and<br>educate them we also have to research<br>into very smart innovative ideas and<br>change the game kind of change the game<br>in uh very simple example would be like<br>the capture you know when you go into<br>online form there's this funny looking<br>diagram there which looks like a few<br>alphabets and you have to key in the<br>alphabet to prove that your human being<br>yeah that actually weeds out a lot of<br>the soal they call it the Bots right the<br>automated programs that that that throw<br>rubbish at websites yeah and just a<br>simple uh invention like that change the<br>game we need more of this so I would<br>like to encourage the the audience you<br>know to to think about more uh<br>gamechanging Innovation or if you<br>interested to do more research into such<br>a gamechanging Innovation contact us and<br>uh and we will be able to to to see how<br>we can help you as well yeah so you can<br>go online and um go to the computer<br>science department website um or Wayne<br>is at taping of Faculty of Law and<br>that's at<br>w.c. NZ and you can go from there I'd<br>like to thank you for joining us this<br>afternoon and thank our panelists Dr<br>Ryan Co associate professor Wayne<br>rumbles and Jeff G thank you and good<br>afternoon</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
