inaugural<br>lecture for Professor<br>grah inaugural lecturers are a way uh of<br>acknowledging the the appointment of new<br>professors uh and giving them an<br>opportunity to share their research<br>interests with their colleagues and<br>members of the<br>community Professor Graham do is one of<br>New Zealand's leading environmental<br>economists and an expert in analyzing<br>the complex relationship between<br>Agriculture and water<br>he holds a professorial position at the<br>University that is jointly funded both<br>by the wo management school and the<br>ministry for the<br>environment Graham grew up on a sheep<br>and beef Farm in the TPP region of the<br>Central North Ireland he has a<br>bachelor's degree in Agricultural<br>Science and a MERS in natural resource<br>economics from Massie University and a<br>PhD in agricultural economics from the<br>University of Western<br>Australia Graham's connection with the<br>University of w dates back to 2010 when<br>he became a part-time senior lecturer in<br>the economics Department while<br>continuing to work as associate<br>professor of environmental economics at<br>the University of Western<br>Australia he was named the top young<br>agronomist by the Australian Society of<br>agronomy in November 2010 and in 2012 he<br>was a finalist in the Kudos awards for<br>Hamilton science<br>excellence gram has spent the past<br>decade researching costeffective<br>measures to reduce the environmental<br>footprint of farming on both sides of<br>the tasmin the primary focus of his<br>research has been reducing levels of<br>contaminants into waterways while at the<br>same time helping Farmers to be more<br>productive to quote grah that's good for<br>everybody and that's of course uh what<br>economics is<br>about a key aspect of Graham's role is<br>to act as a senior advisor to the<br>ministry for the environment on water<br>management issues he provides insights<br>into the economic impact of new policies<br>to improve the water quality of New<br>Zealand's rivers lakes and streams and<br>balancing that against the economic<br>benefits of<br>Agriculture gr's research has been used<br>to guide decisions regarding management<br>of Lake Rotorua management of the wadoo<br>and wiper River catchments and water<br>allocation and storage options<br>Zealand gr is published across a broad<br>range of subject areas most of his<br>recent Publications examine issues such<br>as the trade-offs between profit<br>production and environmental footprint<br>on dairy farms in the woto region<br>improving the profitability of woto<br>dairy farms managing greenhouse gas<br>emissions in two major Dairy regions and<br>evaluating scenarios for water quality<br>in the W and wper River<br>catchments ladies and gentlemen uh will<br>you please welcome to give his an<br>overall professorial lecture Professor<br>granal thank thank you very much Neil<br>and before I start firstly I'd like to<br>thank the U I'd like to thank the<br>University of w for the strong support<br>in this position uh for supporting the<br>chair of environmental economics here at<br>the University of work and also the<br>ministry for the environment um I<br>believe my manager ver power is here<br>tonight and without her vision this<br>position wouldn't uh wouldn't have<br>happened wouldn't have come to fruition<br>and uh that's one thing I have noticed<br>about you know that's one core thing<br>that I've really enjoyed I've work with<br>the government role and especially the<br>ministry for the environment Embrace a<br>very strong uh ethic of Novel ways of<br>thinking and trying to uh really uh work<br>together to try and solve our<br>environmental problems at the uh at the<br>regional and National scales so you know<br>I've been privileged to really uh what<br>really kind of encourage really home my<br>practice and I've evolved a lot uh as an<br>economist you know through that uh work<br>as an advisor uh for the last two years<br>but especially in the last year in this<br>position so I hope you might see the<br>name of the topic there up on the screen<br>uh it's a bit of a funny uh my old dirt<br>new boots seems like a funny bit of a<br>funny title but really what it comes<br>down to is is that you know new ways of<br>thinking about old<br>problems um you know one of my friends<br>asked me today he said you know how do<br>uh how do I tell you if if if you're not<br>doing a good job during the uh good job<br>during the lecture how do I tell you<br>that um how do I tell you that that I<br>don't think they're going that well he<br>goes maybe I'll just throw things less<br>hard this time you know so but you know<br>and I don't know whether that was a bad<br>moment or what but really really what<br>I'm trying to talk about to today is<br>about a journey you know uh when we talk<br>about old and new we're talking about a<br>journey through time we're talking about<br>quite a strong journey of time and I<br>think about if we go right back to 1986<br>I went to Tai Primary School which in<br>the modern terminology is known as a<br>desol one school and I was the bottom I<br>think I was on standard 4 and I was the<br>bottom of the class I was going to<br>school to eat my lunch and I I literally<br>was I remember thinking you know why do<br>we have to do this other stuff I want to<br>play soccer and play rugby and things<br>but you know and I'm from a sheet Farm<br>got an Old Homestead there and there's<br>an old sliding door between our lounge<br>and our dining room and I remember I was<br>watching the old black and white TV in<br>the lounge and with a sliding door Clos<br>my parents were in the other room and I<br>remember my father uh my mother saying<br>to my father she said what you know what<br>the hell are we going to do with this<br>boy you know and I remember my father<br>saying you know just he didn't know what<br>was going to go on he said uh he said we<br>just you know he's uh not doing very<br>well at school they're talking about<br>putting him to a special school and<br>things and my father said you know have<br>you ever seen this guy try and right<br>because it's not legible you know and so<br>my mother said I remember hearing my<br>mother say uh yeah but you know that<br>still doesn't fix it what are we going<br>to do and I remember my father saying he<br>goes I don't know what we're going to do<br>but how about tomorrow I sit down with<br>him for 20 30 minutes and we start<br>writing out some stuff get them instead<br>of trying to write two pages in in a you<br>know not in a short time let's flip and<br>try and let's try and slow him down let<br>his brain work a bit so I remember the<br>next day my father sat me down at the<br>sat on one corner I sat on the other and<br>he said right slowly and flipp was<br>painful about 20 minutes to do five<br>lines if I remember and I was writing<br>about the Olympics out of an old<br>encyclopedia from<br>1975 and you know that was it that was<br>the next night I did the same thing my<br>father was there as well and then after<br>a while my father kind of lost the<br>enthusiasm a bit I remember him just<br>delegating it to me going be your<br>writing boy and you know that was the<br>start you know that was a small step but<br>uh 4 years later I was the ducks in the<br>school um um once I you know after I<br>started writing I actually became<br>interested in what was in the<br>encyclopedia started reading broadly and<br>I became quite interested and then you<br>know 30 years later after that small<br>step 30 years later now standing here<br>giving an augural professorial lecture<br>you know so really it was a journey and<br>the journey is not finished by any means<br>like you know just turned 40 uh tur just<br>become a professor and I think you know<br>but even though there is steps on the<br>journey to come you know I have been<br>through quite quite a big journey I<br>think but it started with a small step<br>you know just uh just my father and<br>mother saying what the hell are we going<br>to do and wanted to do things<br>differently and you know and I think<br>that's really what my talk is about<br>today is really about time and Journeys<br>and steps and small small and secure<br>steps on those<br>Journeys um in such a journey we see is<br>actually in our our national Journey<br>which I think is one of the most<br>interesting Journeys that um I'm that<br>I'm interested in you know Sir George<br>saen back in 1926 he was the top<br>scientist in the uh in the British<br>Empire at the time and and he he made<br>quite a bold statement he said grassland<br>equally with the sea is to be regarded<br>as one of the cornerstones on which the<br>greatness of the British Empire has been<br>built and you know at the time the<br>British uh Imperial Navy for the you<br>know and for the years previous was<br>actually a very strong potent Force<br>however what he was saying is that<br>really we uh through Ry grass and white<br>clover they were the seeds of an Empire<br>and there's recently been a book about<br>five or six years ago was was called<br>seeds of an Empire which was all about<br>the spread of Ry grass and white clover<br>and how how the development of these<br>Colonial Powers was based on the grazing<br>enimy and so right from the start we<br>seeing our national Journey just you<br>know quite a strong um essence of<br>pastoralism and that Colonial dominance<br>over the landscape and not only is it a<br>national Journey it's a bit of a<br>personal Journey as well uh this man<br>here I know it's a bit of a hard photo<br>to see that was taken on an iPhone I<br>think in the iPhone as good as the<br>Samsung but the<br>but that's my great great grandfather so<br>my grandfather's grandfather his name<br>was John Doan he came here to S the<br>Mutiny in India in 1862 wasn't man he<br>came here and fought at gate par uh did<br>well to survive gate par and this was a<br>photo was taken in the tanaki at one of<br>the celebrations you know to say you<br>know we lived through the war but you<br>know he came and after that and started<br>farming Romy sheep in about 1865 after<br>the war finish uh in the t region and<br>then after that uh basically we still<br>doing the same thing 150 years later so<br>it's how part of our family farm there<br>which my grandfather farmed my father<br>farmed uh you know what we see there is<br>that it's not only a national journey of<br>Agriculture and real strong Reliance on<br>that grazing animal it's also a bit of a<br>personal journey and you know I always<br>love feeling it you know I always love<br>just uh thinking about that Journey you<br>know it's kind of uh when I'm dealing<br>with it in my work I you know I love<br>having that background having that uh<br>having that basis of my work you know<br>because we are tied to that Journey that<br>our nation's been through however you<br>know when we do have Journeys there are<br>the good part good times and the bad<br>times uh we're a small open economy and<br>one of the things that we've one of the<br>things that we see on on when we're<br>reliant on Commodities uh on the<br>production of a lot of Commodities<br>within a small open economy is we see a<br>high degree of volatility so a few years<br>ago I was working uh with some people<br>from Daran Zed and one of the top<br>scientists at Dar and Zed he said the<br>price will never be below $6 don't<br>bother you know evaluating these plans<br>if the price goes under $6 I think a<br>year later it went down to $4 something<br>you know and which was a half I think<br>went from 820 to 420 or something like<br>that and so we see that volatility and I<br>was on a plane recently and there was a<br>guy there from the Manuka Honey industry<br>he was one of the big people and he said<br>this is a manuka honey he told me was<br>the only industry that's Recession Proof<br>he said you it's got high we've got high<br>prices in there at the moment he said<br>it's you know impossible to fail and I<br>think you know I I just I I didn't quite<br>trust them I think if we look at uh the<br>dairy industry the goat the goat<br>industry emu ostriches water buffalo uh<br>American suffs you know if we look back<br>in time we do know that our commodity<br>Cycles uh do go up and<br>down uh another negative aspect really<br>of having our agricult of having uh<br>having a strong Alliance on the grazing<br>animal within our economy um is the fact<br>that when we intensify our land we we<br>actually lose some contaminants from our<br>land so you think that a lot of this<br>land for example we've got about 1.1<br>million hectares of agricultural land<br>across the<br>white historically a lot of that was<br>swamp land or native Forest uh or native<br>forest with very low uh with very low<br>contaminant losses to water however now<br>what we see is a very uh we've taken a<br>lot of that away and now we've placed a<br>quite you know quite of that Colonial<br>landscape that grassland landscape and<br>it's become highly productive very<br>highly productive highly profitable as<br>well but in doing that we've increased<br>the contaminant load so the the losses<br>of materials we loose water has<br>increased and so we get intensification<br>so right now on New Zealand sheep farms<br>we see uh cropping of you know some<br>using tractor tractor cropping some<br>quite steep land and so we can get soil<br>erosion from that land um on some sheep<br>and beef land they spray large steep<br>hillsides during um during early summer<br>well I'm saying class 7even Hill Country<br>where Class 8 is basically we can't we<br>shouldn't be grazing Class 8 land it's<br>you know it's the very steep stuff but<br>on the class seven land they're planting<br>crops on there through spraying it by<br>helicopter uh seing it and then hoping<br>that it rains and that's why it's called<br>Spray and prey Agriculture and you know<br>you know you see the spray and prey<br>agriculture like recently I went horse<br>riding we went horse riding through a<br>whole landscape with about 100 or 200<br>hectares of spraying prey which was just<br>bare duded uh hillsides like this but in<br>November which is the the hills were<br>about twice as th and you know just when<br>we look at that it's just you know<br>sometimes we think aren't we better than<br>that and uh another thing we have you<br>know I'm working with investment at the<br>moment what we see throughout the Hill<br>Country there is we' got high uh you<br>know we've we've taken the big trees and<br>we've taken their roots that anchor the<br>off that land and so these land with<br>very these this landscape with very soft<br>soil very fragile soils High rainfall<br>and steep GR<br>uh if you get enough water the soil<br>becomes very heavy and washes off so we<br>get erosion and you can see in the<br>background there extensive erosion down<br>that uh<br>siding um another thing is by virtue of<br>our landscape is that we have a lot of<br>uh a lot of it's heavily dissected which<br>by means there's a lot of valleys<br>through there so we find a lot of<br>streams which are flowing for all part<br>of the year and so because it's very<br>hard to fence all of them we we often<br>have quite a high connection between the<br>livestock uh between the livestock and<br>the Waterway and this can lead to<br>enrichment with nitrogen and phosphorus<br>uh and also FAL microbes are a large one<br>uh such as eoli can blow back to Jia and<br>also uh sediment as well we can have<br>stream bank erosion so when the large<br>you know when the large heavy animal<br>stands on the side of the stream can<br>push dirt directly into there so that's<br>another thing on our journey towards<br>improving uh economic outcomes for the<br>region and the nation we're actually<br>placing pressure on our uh on our<br>waterways at the same time and the<br>reason why this is a problem of course<br>is that you know tourism now is one of<br>the most important industries uh within<br>the economy but also as you know as new<br>zealanders ourselves we we feel very<br>connected to the waterways so we really<br>enjoy uh swimming and Rowing and the<br>swimming and Rowing for example so this<br>picture here is in Lake kapiro where<br>they uh you know they held the world<br>Champs there for rowing a few years ago<br>it's used every year um used every year<br>for that purpose but people fishing<br>there as well um and so as we find as we<br>find the input of nutrients uh the input<br>of contaminants into those waterways it<br>can affect the way we interact with it<br>for example I go fishing off the head of<br>the dam here for trout but as soon as it<br>comes about October November I have to<br>stop because there's so much weed<br>growing in it that it catches my line uh<br>you know I lose about $10 worth of<br>spinners every time I go in uh in there<br>in October and November so I sto doing<br>it but we've got we've got to the stage<br>where we actually use a physical removal<br>of the weed in there and the reason re<br>the reason that the ele grows in there<br>is because the dams slow the water down<br>and it has time for the water which is<br>enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus to<br>grow these nuisance El<br>species uh another example of sediment<br>so this is the wo River bban uh 18<br>million tons of sediment a year uh going<br>into the sea you know that's I think<br>that's about 10 about 10% of New<br>Zealand's total sediment load about 18<br>million tons a year you know it's that's<br>significant so and that's because of our<br>you know our extensive Forest over that<br>pastural land and sediment a problem of<br>course because if we go swimming we<br>can't see in front of us um at the same<br>time it carries phosphorus which we<br>which can lead to El elal enrichment um<br>but also it can uh change the way that<br>Etc uh also we have microbial microbial<br>problems so some of you would have heard<br>uh recently Bri in the news right now<br>there's CA um<br>Campa poisoning in U in the Hawks Bay<br>Region uh but even in our Rivers there<br>are some places which are dend unsafe to<br>unsafe for swim ability due to high<br>levels of Eola which is an indicator for<br>those bugs that make you sick more like<br>Campo back the Jia and cryptos spum so<br>if we see in the if we this graph here<br>shows us the sites that are deemed<br>swimmable or un swimable in the upper W<br>River it's very pristine Lake Tapo is<br>very pristine itself so we have a very<br>it's very safe to swim there and then<br>down that dilution effect also carries<br>down to the lower White River so we have<br>about uh but still there's more than 60%<br>of sites are unable however in these<br>tributaries in the lower white cow and<br>white part we see that there is a very<br>high um number of sites that are<br>unswimmable so here we've got about 97%<br>of sites in the lower white C unsafe<br>swimming due to microbial loads some of<br>them arising from Human you know sing<br>tanks Etc but a lot of them is are from<br>um low uh from FAL loads of<br>livestock I think a single I think a<br>single uh cow pack contains about a<br>billion E coli so you know it's so that<br>connection between stock and the<br>waterways is important and if we're<br>valuing our swimming you know I think<br>New Zealand is starting to recognize and<br>the government's really responded to it<br>I think as well that really strong focus<br>on trying to improve uh water quality<br>within our<br>nation you know I really you know the<br>blessing or the happy side of the story<br>is that we actually have a lot of<br>Technologies available to improve the um<br>to reduce the amount of contaminants<br>lost from our uh lost from our<br>agricultural land so if we look back to<br>the uh you know for since the 50s and<br>60s there's been strong soil<br>conservation movement in New Zealand we<br>see uh planting trees planting uh<br>planting Willows or poppers uh on on<br>Broad Hills Scapes to hold the to stop<br>soil erosion uh we have sediment traps<br>to capture the sediment coming down<br>stream WS to stop them going further<br>through the uh flow Network we have<br>aforestation in parts so here we have<br>Pine Forest here we have Pine Forest we<br>see this Pine Forest really holding up<br>the uh holding up the<br>hillsides sometimes<br>uh so in part in parts of the country<br>where we have high erosion losses you<br>know we see a movement back towards uh<br>full of forestation and also we have uh<br>string Bank fencing as well to to keep<br>the stock out of the waterways uh this<br>is amazing to see at the moment like I<br>go to work in gbon quite a bit go for a<br>run in the morning and you just it's<br>amazing you see these logging trucks<br>about every or every 10 minutes every 15<br>minutes you just see a logging truck<br>coming past and it feels you know it<br>feels really amazing because they<br>they're carrying this product that's<br>been grown on the land and you just<br>think you know every time that's going<br>to the port they're filling up another<br>filling up another uh large logging boat<br>and that's really good for the regional<br>economy and it's quite amazing to see<br>that but somebody told me at the<br>district council this the same day that<br>that's actually uh they were what they<br>call Cyclone bowler forests they planted<br>those trees there uh after Cyclone<br>bowler to hold the hillsides there so<br>what we're actually doing 28 30 years<br>later is actually taking down those<br>forests that had held those sorts for 30<br>years in so they're expecting some more<br>uh some more erosion over the next 5 6<br>years until the new Forest starts to ro<br>you know starts to hold the ground<br>through its Root Root Root anchors so<br>you know so we do actually have these<br>Technologies and these Technologies uh<br>the most effective Technologies are what<br>are actually different from you know how<br>a lot of people perceive um mitigation<br>mitigations or abatement practices to<br>reduce contaminant loss what they what<br>examp examp of what economists actually<br>called Capital so when we talk about<br>Capital we mean something longlasting or<br>durable something that we can in can<br>invest in so sometimes when we talk<br>about reducing nitrogen leeching for<br>example or nitrogen loss from farms what<br>we talk about is we can reduce nitrogen<br>fertilizer and that will reduce uh loss<br>of nitrogen by some component but a lot<br>of the mitigations are actually Capital<br>there are actually durable and long<br>lasting so this fence here we built it<br>probably going to last 15 years maybe<br>years uh if we put these trees here<br>they're probably there for 30 years uh<br>if we put a sediment trap in there if we<br>maintain it it will last you know 30 40<br>years if we don't it'll probably last<br>maybe 10 or 20 but the thing is is that<br>what's really important is that they<br>durable they're long lasting they're<br>there they're there for uh they're there<br>for a certain length of time and that is<br>really the uh core of what I'm trying to<br>talk about today like I've spoken uh<br>earlier on in the lecture I spoke about<br>Journeys and policy Journeys and really<br>what I'm trying to identify here is that<br>a big problem with the way that we've<br>been interpreting the economic analysis<br>of water quality improvement in New<br>Zealand is that we forgot about time is<br>that somewhere along here we've lost the<br>truth we've actually lost our ability to<br>think of our mitigations as capital and<br>also by doing that we've actually gone<br>away from adoptability so that's the<br>rest of my talk is will be based around<br>what I mean by<br>that so if if we've been to the South<br>Island if any Of You' been to the South<br>Island recently driven through ooto<br>through Southland through cbury over the<br>last 20 to 30 years what we've seen is a<br>very significant change in the landscape<br>where we had Romy sheep and some of the<br>best sheep studs in New Zealand what we<br>now have is uh very intensive dairy<br>farms and a lot of that is uh thanks to<br>irrigation so the fact that we can now<br>grow grass in places where it's<br>traditionally too dry to do so on some<br>of these Farms grass growth has gone<br>from tons per year to 21 tons per year<br>uh because now we can have that water in<br>a dry place what we're seen is very<br>rapid adoption of this Capital so<br>irrigation capital is very long lasting<br>what we've had is very high adoption of<br>that and very rapid adoption of that and<br>the reason why we've had rapid adoption<br>of that is because it offers a lot to<br>the farming system itself it offers<br>security it offers higher production it<br>offers profit uh it also raises the<br>value of your land and So within that<br>we've actually experience quite rapid<br>uptake uh of farmer on farm and the<br>thing that we the thing that I think<br>really in terms of Environmental Quality<br>is that where I think our farming system<br>design is missing something is that<br>we're not getting such rapid adoption of<br>practices that are environmentally<br>focused or conservation<br>focused and I think uh and I think that<br>also because we don't focus on<br>adoptability<br>um I think it also changes the way that<br>we perceive the economic analysis of<br>these<br>problems so when we look at our standard<br>way we perform economic analysis in New<br>Zealand can basically be shown on this<br>graph so here we have profit up here so<br>that's if we're making positive money is<br>above the line if we're making negative<br>money we're losing money it's down here<br>and if we have environmental benefits<br>it's along this uh axis here so options<br>here uh have low environmental benefit<br>and they're increasing out here so we<br>have high environmental benefits here<br>often what we do as Economist is<br>identify where different options sit on<br>this uh on this axis and how high so one<br>example could be for example we might<br>have we might be able to get some part<br>of the way some environmental benefit by<br>doing something that's very good for<br>farm income one example is improving the<br>way that we utilize uh UTI improving the<br>way that we utilize winter crops on<br>farms and so that one there option one<br>has positive profit and it's to do with<br>some small change in efficiency on our<br>farming system<br>uh and if we conducting a standard<br>economic analysis we'll go through and<br>we usually Identify two or three other<br>scenarios and what we usually find<br>generally is as we go as we look at<br>contam trying to reduce contaminant<br>loss uh if we trying to reduce<br>contaminant loss by more than 10% what<br>we find is that we start to lose uh<br>money and especially at the other end<br>for option four we start to what we<br>start to see as quite High uh<br>environmental benefits but that's<br>usually associated with quite High costs<br>because we might have to do some land<br>use change back to pasture back to<br>example and so this is the standard way<br>that uh standard way that economists in<br>New Zealand perceive the water quality<br>problem uh but the thing is what what we<br>look at that is actually highly static<br>what an economist will call static it's<br>a single point in time but really these<br>options have different have different<br>Pathways uh to their introduction so to<br>move landscape to a point where we<br>obtain higher environmental benefits one<br>where we have uh quite significant areas<br>of production forestry or na Forest uh<br>is very difficult that pathway is quite<br>long quite protracted whereas if we're<br>trying to improve efficiency on Farm it<br>can be quite uh short it can be quite<br>targeted but you know really if we look<br>across New Zealand we don't see a very<br>strong focus on how best to Stage that<br>transition and that's what I'm thinking<br>is that you know really the L that we're<br>missing is the what I call the<br>adoptability lens is that when we think<br>about these alternative practices when<br>we think about the menu of choices what<br>we're forgetting about is the pathway so<br>it's almost envisaging that if we're<br>doing the evaluations that this is a<br>pathway so we might be aiming for four<br>but we might actually start at one and<br>just work our way down however econom<br>economics in a standard form is not<br>doing that presently and I think you<br>know and I think by doing that we're<br>actually missing some of the uh<br>important insights I think a good way of<br>showing this is what uh is a<br>sophisticated framework known as the can<br>quadrant uh it's not that sophisticated<br>which is good uh really it's a<br>relationship between profit and loss is<br>on there so if it's above this line if<br>it's above this line we're making money<br>if it's below the line we're losing<br>money if it's to the right of this point<br>here it's very it's getting more and<br>more complex if it's to the left of this<br>line it's<br>simple um what we're looking for really<br>when we're trying what I think is that<br>by focusing on highly adoptable actions<br>if we focus when we when we're trying to<br>design our policy Journey if we focus on<br>adoptable actions what we can do is that<br>there's a really uh Strong place there<br>to reduce our enforcement costs uh gain<br>positive momentum and it really um<br>breaks down it really breaks down the<br>opportunity for resistance I think<br>working with people uh I think there's<br>an amazing opportunity to work with<br>people uh work with Industries and work<br>with Farmers to actually really get some<br>momentum on envir for environmental<br>Improvement and really where that sits<br>is in this part of the graph if we have<br>profitable and simple Technologies for<br>improving the environment uh and we can<br>rely on that to spread throughout the<br>landscape so we have a diffusion across<br>the landscape um then I think that is<br>really uh is really an easy solution if<br>we can develop Solutions like that uh<br>farmers will be more willing to uptake<br>those type of Technologies uh whereas<br>there are other options if we're if<br>we're trying to make farmers do things<br>which are complex and do things which<br>make them lose money then really that's<br>a difficult way for a policy Journey<br>we're not getting that uptake you know<br>and what we find that's an area of<br>strong resistance as well so I've seen<br>in a couple of processes now where uh<br>people have been very keen on imposing<br>quite strict environmental uh<br>regulations and Industry have said no uh<br>let's push it out you know that is a<br>very uh and that is because sometimes<br>that policy as we aim for uh that place<br>as we aim for that place uh it's not<br>actually very good on on the ground so<br>to speak and sometimes also there scope<br>up in the Northeast quadrant where it<br>may be profitable but also it might be<br>complex and I think we can learn you<br>know in the environmental sphere I think<br>we can actually take a lot from the<br>production uh from the what we observe<br>in the production sphere so this is a<br>this is a photo of my father looking<br>cows when he was 8 years old I think it<br>was 1954 he might be in the crowd he<br>might be able to tell me the year bit<br>but if we tried to milk 2,000 cows in<br>Cur right now using that it's simple you<br>know it's pretty easy to milk a cow by<br>hand I could never do it is one thing<br>that I always struggled with but uh it<br>is actually pretty simple but the thing<br>is that to milk 2,000 cows like that is<br>uh you're probably losing<br>money uh but but in terms of milking<br>2000 CS what we see now is actually some<br>new technologies coming available this<br>is an automatic milking system so some<br>people call it the robot milker the cow<br>Walks In by itself whenever it wants um<br>the machine comes out places the T<br>places the uh milking machine on the<br>tents uh harvests the milk at the end of<br>the day you get an email in your inbox<br>about how much milk Daisy 1 and Daisy 2<br>have produced today and it's much easier<br>on the cow however it is complex you<br>know a lot of farms aren't set up to<br>utilize that uh but my friends installed<br>it recently had to spend 2 days taking<br>photos of the different others of 300<br>cows because the robot has to know where<br>to place the uh the cups on the teeth so<br>you know it's it's it's still a bit comp<br>it's still a bit complex it's still in<br>in its infancy you know that's the type<br>of thing that we're trying to deal with<br>is that we've got we got old<br>Technologies which are superseded uh<br>we've got new technologies which are<br>standing there but then we've got this<br>one that we're trying to the incumbent<br>that we're trying to uh replace because<br>of we this one here it might replace but<br>when we're talking about environmental<br>Improvement we're trying to actually<br>displace an incumbent which might be<br>less environmentally friendly this<br>example here is the rotary shed very<br>suitable for milking large herds I think<br>40 about 45% of New Zealand's herds now<br>are milk using that technology but to<br>displace it um very difficult because a<br>lot of people have learned how to use it<br>and it's already there and what makes<br>things hard is that when we have an<br>incumbent technology it's very hard to<br>very hard to replace it even for things<br>that you would think are disruptive<br>Technologies so this graph here shows<br>the tractor uh the adoption of the<br>tractor in the USA so 1910 there was<br>still a lot of uh horses and donkeys<br>being used to pull the uh being used to<br>pull the<br>plow but it took 16 years for the<br>tractor use to increase 80% saturation<br>across the population and across that<br>there was many things had to happen<br>there was laws introduced to change land<br>tenure there was market and Technical<br>development Market Market changes there<br>was technical innovation in arable crops<br>but there was also technical innovation<br>in the tractor and the uh and also the<br>implements used alongside the tractor<br>and so you know a disruptive technology<br>such as the tractor replacing the hor<br>still took 60 years UH 60 years to<br>happen but once it did it was amazing<br>because uh what you see through the 30s<br>40s and 50s is that you actually had a<br>lot of African-American people who had<br>got given land after the War uh<br>displaced because people now could<br>Harvest uh Harvest 200 Acres with a<br>tractor instead of uh 40 acres with his<br>mu and so you see a large Urban<br>migration around that time to Detroit uh<br>from displaced cotton Farmers because of<br>the tractor moving to Detroit so you<br>know there's massive social upheaval as<br>well that goes with this kind of U<br>technical Innovation and its<br>adoption uh one thing which also makes<br>uh the adoption of new farming systems<br>that are more conservation uh conserv<br>that are better for the environment is<br>also the fact that we have what a calls<br>called Sun costs um every economics<br>professor will tell you sunk costs don't<br>matter you know if youve spent money in<br>the past and spent now don't worry about<br>it however in reality it's a bit<br>different you know we uh if youve bought<br>a dairy farm for $7 million and it's<br>humming<br>along and and and to improve the<br>environment you have to do something<br>different which might mean you lose some<br>value in your asset so you no longer<br>have a 7 million doll dairy farm but a<br>$3 million dairy farm or a $2 million<br>sheet Farm you know there's we get<br>strong strong uh there are strong<br>resistance um to that another point is<br>actually learning as well is that when<br>we have incumbent ways of farming uh<br>what What's engrossed within them is<br>actually lowc cost ways of production<br>when we grow when we're like I spoke<br>earlier about my my great<br>great-grandfather and he grazed sheep<br>and he grazed sheep just what my<br>great-grandfather my my grandfather my<br>father uh you know we've all we've gr<br>ship and we've learned through doing<br>that Granddad taught my father how to<br>farm my father taught me how to farm you<br>know it's just something that's inra<br>within us if we want to do something<br>different then it's actually higher and<br>higher cost for us it's harder for us<br>cuz we have to learn new ways of farming<br>and the older we get as Farmers uh the<br>older we get the sometimes less uh less<br>King we are to learn these new ways so<br>we can actually have this kind of strong<br>inertia to change so when we're trying<br>to think about environmentally friendly<br>farming systems we're up against it<br>because not only does it not only do<br>people have uh a lot of money tied up in<br>the game uh a lot of skin in the game<br>I've heard people comment a lot of farms<br>prob me skin in the game but also uh if<br>we want to you if we want to focus on<br>new ways of farming um also we've got<br>we've got to learn how to do it which is<br>a<br>cost another fact is that uh I'm sorry<br>this one's a bit hard to see but another<br>one that's quite difficult is that is<br>that a lot of our contaminant loss<br>problems are hard to change on a farm so<br>we've got e Colo losses from sheep farms<br>uh per hectare they're about can be 10<br>times higher for Sheet Farm than for a<br>dairy farm so we got quite a problem and<br>what we're trying to do is reduce the<br>amount of feal microbes or the amount of<br>gun going from a an area of sheep farm<br>into a stream and we just did a small<br>workshop with Farmers trying to<br>understand you know what are these uh<br>what are these different options and how<br>do you perceive them when I showed up I<br>I think they almost had a new setup<br>because uh the briefing they got before<br>the meeting is that we've got someone<br>from government coming to tell you to<br>fence your creeks and so uh yeah I could<br>smell a bit of burning I think they were<br>burning an Effy behind the and they had<br>a new set up but in any case it was we<br>actually half the time was just like<br>showing no no we're actually here to<br>work with you uh but you know and that I<br>just Ed what you know use the framework<br>I was talking about before we had profit<br>on the top loss on the bottom low<br>complexity and high complexity and we<br>talked about what are these different<br>things we can get that we can use to get<br>the Sheep away from the creek we can uh<br>put a water source that don't have to<br>drink out of the creek anymore we'll put<br>water over here uh we can change it to<br>forestry land exchange we don't have<br>sheep even in these around these streams<br>um we can fence the stream itself which<br>is you know spoke is quite bro it's<br>quite broadly spoken on as litigation uh<br>or also we can put a Crossing you know<br>we build a little Bridge so the sheep<br>can walk across that doesn't have to<br>walk down through this through the<br>stream so those ways of reducing the<br>connectedness between the livestock and<br>the<br>strength and you know and so we spoke<br>about all of those and then we just put<br>them up on the wall and what you see you<br>see there's quite a strong there's a few<br>options that are profitable in low<br>complexity which is the ones we want the<br>win-wins or the ones that we're hoping<br>can be easily adopted but really what we<br>see is a skewing down or an aggregation<br>or accumulation down in this Southeast<br>quadrant of loss and of a loss and<br>profit and complex um and complex for<br>the farming system itself and if you<br>look at this Countryside it is a bit<br>like that you know it is it's difficult<br>to see how we can reduce that<br>connectedness and so you know that kind<br>of adds to the complexity of the problem<br>uh when we're trying to think about<br>these uh extending these new farming<br>systems across a<br>landscape uh another another point is<br>that a lot of actions that we have on<br>Farm are beneficial for society but not<br>for the farmer so they might be<br>beneficial or might have limited benefit<br>for a farmer so they have a high public<br>benefit but not a high private benefit<br>so we're starting to see especially in<br>the W now quite High investment in<br>Wetlands you the wetlands really are you<br>know some people call them the uh the<br>you know the kidneys of the landscape<br>I've heard someone call them you know<br>they hope to cleanse uh cleanse all bad<br>things that we do all around them but uh<br>and they really are you know they can<br>capture the sediment they can denitrify<br>the nitrogen so send it to the<br>atmosphere um and also sometimes they<br>might lead to the loss of Eola as well<br>microbes manage those and so the Wetland<br>is actually quite a positive this one<br>here has just been built so there's<br>still a lot of uh a lot of vegetation<br>grow to go forward but that can be quite<br>expensive can be $100,000 $200,000 for a<br>nice Wetland uh and the amount of profit<br>that it's going to increase your farm by<br>it's not going to increase profit on<br>your farm probably it's not going to<br>increase it by much at all uh if if at<br>all so that highlights uh highights one<br>point a lot of people have said you know<br>can we is there a way that we can help<br>uh put public money towards encouraging<br>options and so I think the W is one of<br>the very good example of that the W<br>River Authority is being funding Wetland<br>development uh throughout uh throughout<br>farming<br>areas another option is uh Forest uh<br>production a for production Forest um so<br>we've seen across New Zealand quite a<br>strong recommendations to plant<br>extensive areas of forest to reduce uh<br>Cent loss nitrogen loss phosphorus loss<br>um but at the same time that changes the<br>dynamic<br>of if you've got a debt if you've got a<br>farm debt that's quite uh that's quite<br>High p in Forest can be quite<br>detrimental to that because you're not<br>going to get paid for it for another 28<br>to 30 years but there's hope that maybe<br>the carbon payments carbon payments is<br>going to help offset that um offset<br>there and so you know really what I<br>think so when we think about that we<br>start thinking about the adoptability of<br>New Zealand's uh practices to improve<br>the environmental footprint of our<br>farming systems I think it's actually<br>quite a difficult story I think the<br>adoption is a really hard uh the<br>adoptability of these really good<br>practices is quite low uh generally but<br>you know I don't think that's<br>really really that that's not telling us<br>that we shouldn't go the journey I just<br>think it's really saying that we need to<br>be uh very wise about how we Step In the<br>Journey um so we're watching my wife and<br>I were watching uh Married at First<br>Sight last night which was a high<br>quality TD program I one of the journ<br>and uh I saw they had this they had this<br>qu too so I thought I'm on the uh I<br>thought if they had it on there then I'm<br>I'm an high quality company anyway a<br>woman had that on her uh had this quote<br>as well up on up on her war and that's<br>what really I've been starting to think<br>about you know what we have is that if<br>we really want to get our water improve<br>our water quality to quite an<br>aspirational State it's quite far from<br>where we are now because we've developed<br>for 150 years 200 years on the back of<br>the grazing animal the grazing animal is<br>not a terribly efficient way of<br>producing ing product and so really it's<br>going to take us a while to transition<br>towards a uh pristine reality or a<br>better reality one that better trades<br>off economic outcomes with uh water<br>outcomes and so really I think that's<br>the challenge to economists is that how<br>do we plan that journey and really how<br>do we start thinking about those steps<br>and you know and that's what I spent the<br>last 6 months working on just in spare<br>time is that starting to think about the<br>journeys and the reason why these<br>Journeys are important is because of<br>uncertainty um you know like I was I<br>don't know I think it was about 6 months<br>ago I was quite happy with things were<br>going in my life and my think my wife<br>had three heart attacks uh before the<br>last professorial lecture and all of a<br>sudden uh it just came out of nowhere<br>and that changed things you know so<br>things just change and it's the same<br>when we're talking about farming systems<br>if we're trying to assess Environmental<br>Policy the world how we see it now is<br>going to be different from what it is in<br>a year and in 5 years time the<br>Technologies we have to mitigate<br>environmental um to mitigate against<br>environmental impacts will be different<br>another 10 years they'll be different<br>again you know we might we might be a<br>manuka honey uh we might be the Manuka<br>Honey capital of the world we might be<br>planting dairy farms to man Manuka<br>bushes uh we don't know and that's what<br>the nature of the world is that it's<br>highly uncertain and it's how we respond<br>to that uncertainty and that's what I<br>think a very pragmatic way of Designing<br>policy is that step you know so rather<br>than thinking about rather than thinking<br>about that long journey is that you know<br>how do economists really think about<br>both me<br>steps and this is i' you know the more<br>reading I've done and the more talking<br>I've done with my colleagues is that<br>really this is what we're missing it's<br>quite a somebody came up with this 100<br>years ago and economists have basically<br>ignored it for 100 years it's known as<br>the diffusion curve which is this is the<br>population using the technology and this<br>is the number of of years that it takes<br>for the population using the technology<br>to increase what we see is that usually<br>at first when a new technology comes in<br>uh it takes some some years some time to<br>get a critical mass then we find quite a<br>rapid uptake through here and then we<br>find a leveling off and this here what<br>we find is we we reach our capacity<br>after 15 years and then 100% of the uh<br>people who can adopt the technology are<br>using it however there are diffusion<br>cures for all types of technology and<br>that highly different uh but some can be<br>rapidly adoped so if I drew one for<br>mobile phones that would go up here they<br>said they've been very rapidly adopted<br>Within 5year period for example they<br>diffused very quickly uh whereas some<br>like diffusing then go off there for<br>example a uh for example Wetlands<br>adoption of wetlands without uh High<br>public investment is predicted to<br>increase slowly up to about 10% over a<br>20 to 25e period so you know really the<br>diffusion curve is something that we<br>don't treat much in economics but really<br>what it does is an encapsulate it<br>captures a lot and describes a lot about<br>adoptability and that adoptability is<br>important because if we can design<br>farming systems or ways of farming that<br>spread across a landscape basically<br>that's our uh environmental problem<br>solved and what I like about when we<br>start to think about diffusion is that<br>uh what it what it does is that it kind<br>of changes our mindset away from trying<br>to focus on really large improvements<br>far in the future what we're thinking<br>about is what can we do now so what<br>we've seen in the last decade we've seen<br>incredible investment by the dairy<br>industry and fencing our streams uh and<br>fencing streams on Dairy Farms you know<br>there is contention about the uh about<br>the usefulness of it and the<br>environmental efficacy you know it's by<br>far it's not I don't think it's by far<br>the most effective mitigation for all<br>contaminants however it's pretty good<br>and the thing is is that the dairy<br>industry said you haven't got a choice<br>you've got to do it as an industry they<br>said that and so you actually got a very<br>strong focus on adoption within the<br>industry same on uh same on Hill Country<br>within our beef beef and lamb NZ who are<br>the sector the sector representatives<br>for the beef and lamb industry they<br>focused on land environment planning so<br>how do we work with Farmers to actually<br>uh Farm to the country better what we<br>see here is actually sector initiatives<br>to try and um setor initiatives to try<br>and improve the environmental footprint<br>of their farming system and you know<br>some people say they're not good enough<br>they're not far enough in terms of<br>environmental Improvement they might not<br>get us all of the way but you know when<br>I when we start think about stages on a<br>journey surely I think this is actually<br>the start of a journey like if we're<br>promoting those steps then that's a<br>pretty good way and especially because<br>we're working together we're not arguing<br>we're not going uh you know these are<br>things which the industry is saying you<br>should really do and if we can get on<br>top of you know if we can really uh<br>encourage that I think that's a really<br>good way of getting momentum uh on that<br>policy<br>Journey so in some recent work uh in<br>some recent work I focused on uh Clarity<br>objectives for a community so at the<br>site they had a a current Clarity of<br>about half a meter and then they were<br>focused on trying to double that to 1 M<br>and so she said you know let's try and<br>model it over time let's try and think<br>about if we were going to maximize the<br>benefits maximize the benefits in term<br>of terms of recreational use but<br>minimize the cost uh to reach those<br>objectives how do we do that across time<br>and I said we've got 30 years to do it<br>it uh what are we doing so I started<br>thinking about that time path and you<br>know what's fascinating is that we<br>actually see that adoption comes into it<br>once we start thinking about adoption we<br>can actually see we can start thinking<br>about transition and staging so Dairy<br>fencing Dairy fencing is by no means the<br>best way to reduce siment loss however<br>within this catchment string Bank siment<br>loss is very high and so because of the<br>high adoptability of this string Bank<br>fencing on a dairy farm and because of<br>the cheap because it can be done cheaply<br>you actually find we have a strong Focus<br>on getting that quickly is that we<br>should fence as many streams as we can<br>within the first 10 years of our<br>policy and then with with also within<br>the catchment we have very soft uh<br>Sandstone uh Hills with with extensive<br>Hill Country sheep based on there so<br>after we've done that after we've got<br>the low hanging fruit let's go for the<br>next low hanging fruit and that's what<br>it's actually that's what I really like<br>about is when we start to think about<br>staging it's like the low hanging fruit<br>we first of all we just stand there and<br>pick the low hanging fruit and we might<br>get a low ladder and get the next one<br>you know we're not trying to go right to<br>the top of the tree right from the start<br>we're not trying to cut the tree down<br>we're just saying let's work with people<br>to make those positive<br>steps and this was one way and this was<br>one way of just trying to think about<br>how do we stage these uh envir this<br>economic analysis time and it's totally<br>different from the standard way this<br>blue box here is how we we would model<br>it in the standard Way New Zealand we<br>would model it basically at year 25 so<br>we'd run the model for one year we<br>wouldn't study the transition we just<br>say in year 25 you need to have all of<br>your dairy dairy strings fenced uh each<br>Farm should have a farm plan to focus on<br>where they can reduce sement loss and<br>you might want to sh fence some of the<br>fence some of the streams on your sheep<br>farms as well so as you see you if this<br>is the traditional way you're modeling<br>and what you're missing out is the<br>journey so rather than thinking of a<br>policy you know rather than having an<br>economics that focuses is on a single<br>point of time or an equilibrium that<br>doesn't exist why don't we focus on that<br>transition and say you know what is that<br>optimal transition or what is those<br>stages on that Journey how do we get<br>that going and you know another exciting<br>thing I think is that once we start<br>thinking about Journeys is that we can<br>actually start thinking about Futures as<br>well so one of my friends has been<br>involved uh been leading a project at<br>Daran Zed um called leap 21 and so what<br>they've done there is that we've got<br>representatives from the dairy sector<br>they've gone out to uh representatives<br>from the dairy sector have gone out and<br>spoken to fona Dairy Farmers uh Ministry<br>for the environment um environmental<br>groups Ministry for primary Industries<br>and trying to see what do the<br>stakeholders want from our dairy<br>industry and New Zealand and then<br>they've said let's imagine you know<br>let's try to think about how we can<br>design a farming system to meet those<br>objectives so we're actually trying to<br>reimagine those Futures reimagine those<br>alternative Futures and then cuz once we<br>once we design those Futures we can<br>start thinking about pathway Pathways to<br>get there I've been involved this was<br>one of the more exciting meetings I've<br>been at this was held in a uh in gisburn<br>in An Early Child Care Center we met<br>with a few Farmers to discuss microbial<br>losses from farms and so this is New<br>Zealand's probably one of the world's<br>experts in e col sitting next to the uh<br>sitting next to the play oven<br>there and right and some of the kids<br>came along and it was you know he was<br>interrupted by screams through the whole<br>meeting and but you know we're working<br>two projects hot Bay now to try and<br>think about how do we think about these<br>new farming systems you know like let's<br>just forget like we in a new farming<br>system we might not even need a grazing<br>animal might not need a grazing cow to<br>produce milk you know what is the future<br>and then once we design those Futures<br>how can we get there so really trying to<br>just start with blank start with blank<br>canvas and start to think about these<br>alternative Futures so really that's uh<br>that's kind of you know being a that's<br>really tonight that's where I want to<br>end my Journey you know my journey that<br>has been my talk uh you know at the<br>start my father like when I spoke about<br>my father improving my writing and then<br>slowly building from there it was like<br>one of those diffusion cures we started<br>small and we got bigger and bigger uh<br>you know really what he said there is<br>just let's just do what we know how to<br>do uh let's do something safe uh let's<br>do something that we you know that we<br>know is not going to work against us<br>let's start out let's do it small you<br>know we don't have to change the world<br>in the day but we have to make a<br>direction we going be safe and secure in<br>our Direction and I think you know I<br>think it's exciting we're in a time as a<br>society New Zealand's really are dynamic<br>in the way we think about policy and I<br>think what's really exciting is to be an<br>economist immersed in that environment<br>and start thinking how as a profession<br>we can really provide um input into<br>planning those policy Journeys so thank<br>you very much and uh it's been great<br>lot<br>well my name is Deborah Willis I'm the<br>acting dean of the management school and<br>it's my very great pleasure to thank<br>Graham for his lecture um and I know<br>many of you have been to a number of<br>inaugurals before but for those of you<br>who perhaps have not the one of the key<br>roles or the key role of an Aug is to<br>show showcase excellent research and to<br>present it to an educated audience and<br>part of the task is to make this<br>relevant to make research relevant and<br>some lecturers struggle with this topic<br>um not the case today uh certainly I<br>think graem's lecture is a textbook case<br>of how academic research Can U make a<br>difference to all of us it's an area<br>that's moving quickly um the discourse<br>around land use and the environment is<br>it's a controversial one but it's<br>certainly a very important one water is<br>clearly right in the center of of that<br>discussion and obviously not without its<br>controversy I think Graham's description<br>of a perhaps slightly tense encounter<br>maybe one or two encounters with Farmers<br>until theyve s got your measure um was<br>was certainly interesting and it's a<br>very clearly a long-term project<br>involving collaboration with government<br>industry leaders scientists and of<br>course<br>Farmers um I was particularly struck by<br>the inclusion of the word people in the<br>title of the lecture um this is clearly<br>a project that's seeking behavioral<br>change and where you put people at the<br>center you need to recognize that these<br>things take time um so it's not going to<br>be easy it's obviously a long-term<br>Journey that's that's still in progress<br>um but I think it'll be it'll be worth<br>it in the end so thank you gra for your<br>lecture it's been an interesting lecture<br>timely relevant and important not just<br>for our region but also much more<br>broadly than that so thank you and<br>please join me in thanking gr one more<br>time and also outside for drinks and<br>some more<br>conversation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
