everybody uh ladies and<br>gentlemen and and distinguished guests<br>uh my name is Helen Nicholson I'm the<br>deputy Vice Chancellor external<br>engagement at the University of atago<br>and it's my great pleasure to welcome<br>you this evening and um to thank Miss<br>Sarah Dai For on behalf of the<br>university for hosting us for this<br>tonight's final lecture in the winter<br>lecture series<br>um the university is really pleased and<br>honored to be able to present these<br>lectures in the parliament<br>buildings now those of you who were here<br>last week will remember that we had a<br>lecture presented by um Professor Greg<br>cook but while we were sitting here<br>there was another event going on<br>upstairs and that was the<br>2016 prime minister's tertiary teaching<br>excellence awards um these awards are an<br>annual event um that celebrates New<br>Zealand's finest tertiary<br>teachers and it's judged by members of<br>the community uh The Wider community and<br>colleagues so the university were very<br>proud to have four of their uh teachers<br>nominated for an award last year last<br>week and I'm very proud to say that all<br>four of our teachers who were nominated<br>won the awards that they were nominated<br>for so these were um Professor Jinta<br>Ruru from The Faculty of law who was one<br>of two sustained Excellence winners in<br>the K Papa Mari category and in the<br>general category we had Dr Judith baup<br>who's a colleague of Dr Greg Cook from<br>microbiology Professor Daryl Tong from<br>our dental school and Rachel zajic from<br>psychology there was a fifth award that<br>evening and that's the highest Accolade<br>of the event the prime minister's<br>Supreme award and that award was given<br>to Professor Jinta Ruru so to get that<br>award um it's considered the the<br>ultimate uh Award of the teaching<br>component of what a university does and<br>it's an extraordinary achievement and<br>one that jent is obviously very proud of<br>but I guess as a university we're very<br>proud because it's the fifth time in a<br>year in fifth one in five years time<br>that we've won this supreme award and it<br>just goes to highlight the fact that not<br>only does the University do excellent<br>research but it also takes its role as<br>being an excellent teacher as as an<br>important<br>part so whilst talking about our<br>excellent um academic Community I'm very<br>pleased to be joined in Wellington this<br>evening by associate associate professor<br>Tony reer and he's going to present our<br>final winter lecture series talk but I<br>should now like to interv introduce<br>Sarah Dai who's um going to introduce<br>our lecturer<br>well thank you very much Helen and thank<br>you everyone uh for tuning up tonight I<br>am delighted to be able to host the<br>University of atago's 2016 winter<br>lecture series here at Parliament this<br>evening as I am an alumni member of the<br>university class of<br>1998 I feel a strong connection uh<br>towards this evening's event and 19 98<br>does seem like a lifetime ago that I was<br>doing the uh triangle between the<br>University Library the Captain Cook<br>heaven in the bowler can you believe it<br>um I don't even know if those pubs<br>actually exist<br>now I'm pleased to report that I did<br>graduate with a law and science degree<br>so my time at University was not<br>wasted tonight marks the sixth and final<br>lecture in this year's series which will<br>be presented by our associate professor<br>Tony reer Tony's research career began<br>in denan in the denan multidisciplinary<br>health and development Research Unit<br>where he contributed to the healthy<br>physical activity and injury prevention<br>aspects of the internationally acclaimed<br>denan longitudinal<br>study he was subsequently appointed<br>research fellow in the injury prevention<br>Research Unit where he completed a PhD<br>in preventative and social medicine<br>and held a health research Council<br>postdoctoral fellowship and later joined<br>the Hugh Adam cancer epidemiology<br>unit today associate professor Rita is<br>co-director of the Cancer Society social<br>and behavioral Research Unit and he has<br>authored almost 100 Publications in<br>peer-reviewed journals his recent work<br>has focused on skin cancer primary<br>prevention and includes studies of<br>practices in New Zealand schools and<br>workplaces his lecture is entitled<br>ultraviolet and the Sunmart kid and he<br>will discuss for us the promising but<br>neglected methods of primary prevention<br>of skin cancer in the New Zealand<br>context and so with that would you<br>please welcome uh associate professor<br>Tony<br>Rita<br>secre my not stand the back there<br>earlier on just nobody moved them<br>fortunately and thank you very much<br>Sarah for that introduction and thank<br>you Helen um for introducing me for the<br>university ofo for supporting this<br>lecture series and toota welcome<br>everybody uh it's good to see you here<br>this<br>evening<br>now when I worked in the denan<br>longitudinal study was mentioned just<br>now the former director Dr Phil Silva<br>used to remind us that if we saw a<br>turtle on the top of a fence post we<br>could be certain that it didn't get<br>there by<br>itself so I need to acknowledge the<br>contributions made by my co-workers to<br>the content of this presentation and<br>support received from the K Society of<br>New Zealand and the university<br>ofo now the general theme of this<br>attaka University Winter electure series<br>is challenging the status quo in New<br>Zealand and I hope to do a bit of that<br>but it's useful to bear in mind that um<br>there are things some things in life um<br>that we can and should try to change and<br>other things that we may interfere with<br>at our<br>paril now the electromagnetic spectrum<br>emitted by our sun provides elements are<br>essential for human life on Earth among<br>these are the warmth and the light<br>represented along the longer wave Banks<br>longer wave length sorry I'm looking for<br>the pointer on the right there and<br>moving left Beyond The Violet band of<br>light through to the<br>ultraviolet um<br>here and that's what is visible at the<br>inner edge of primary rainbows so beyond<br>the Violet is known as the ultraviolet<br>radiation it's usually not visible to<br>the human eye almost all uvr that<br>reaches the surface of the Earth is the<br>longer wavelength length lower energy<br>UVA but some of the more biologically<br>active UVB that is not absorbed by the<br>ozone layer or the upper atmosphere is<br>also reaches the surface now terrestrial<br>life on Earth will be severely<br>negatively affected if ultraviolet<br>radiation if it was not filtered out so<br>the ozone layer here protects life on<br>Earth some local factors can influence<br>uvr levels for example uvr in our<br>immediate surrounding ings known as<br>ambient uvr increases with altitude by<br>about 5% for every th000 M and cloud<br>cover can attenuate clear sky level uvr<br>and it's also elevated by the albo or<br>reflectivity of water and snow and fresh<br>snow can reflect about 80% as anybody<br>who's been burnt up inside their nose<br>from reflected light will know it's very<br>painful however there are a number of<br>generic environmental factors more<br>broadly determined the uvi levels that<br>we experienced and some of these had<br>particular significance for New Zealand<br>some factors can be influenced by human<br>activities for example atmospheric<br>pollution or aerosol levels can cause up<br>to a 20% reduction in the experience of<br>uvr in the northern hemisphere but this<br>hardly affects New Zealand because our<br>Southern skies are at the moment<br>relatively<br>unpolluted so what are the main<br>geophysical environmental factors that<br>affect uvr levels in New<br>Zealand in 1980s there was a lot of<br>concern about the release of chlorop<br>foro carbons CFCs and other industrial<br>produced chemicals that were depleting<br>the protective ozone layer and ozone<br>declined about 6% pre um to below the<br>pre- 1980 levels between 1980 and 1996<br>for the mid latitudes that's 35 to 60°<br>South in this NASA image the mean area<br>of ozone depletion the blue so-called<br>ozone hole was one of the largest ever<br>experienced and decreases of ozone up to<br>10% were reported in New Zealand in the<br>month following the breakup of this<br>Antarctic event was Associated patchy<br>increases in UVB during spring<br>months and lately ozone recovery has<br>been in the news and if the Montreal<br>protocol had not been implemented and<br>been affected we'd now be routinely<br>experiencing significantly elevated uvi<br>levels and heading towards being<br>literally fried later this century when<br>the level of ultraviolet<br>radiation in the higher levels of the<br>ultraviolet index the scientific measure<br>of ultraviolet radiation I'll come back<br>to in a minute it was projected to about<br>double from the current New Zealand<br>maximum and this you can see in this<br>slide down here this is the what we were<br>projected to experience if the Montreal<br>protocol hadn't been signed and this is<br>what is now predicted the more benign<br>expected<br>future that this world avoided scenario<br>on the right is not happening<br>illustrates not only how benign<br>environmental processes can be disrupted<br>by human activities but also how the<br>need and means to rectify our mistakes<br>can be identified by science and the<br>effect of social responses for our<br>Collective protection can be implemented<br>so fortunately as I said we're heading<br>towards the more expected future now<br>ozone depletion provided us with a<br>warning and had some effect on raising o<br>uvr levels in New Zealand but it's very<br>important to be aware that it's other<br>factors in particular latitude season<br>and time of day that largely determine<br>the residual already high levels of<br>seasonal uvr experienced here and it's<br>to these that we need to respond<br>sensibly by applying our scientific<br>understanding with respect to<br>Latitude those areas that lie closest to<br>the equator tend to have the highest uvr<br>levels Alo New Zealand lies between<br>about 35 and 47 South but when we<br>consider the uvr levels that it's<br>instructive to compare our location in<br>the southern hemisphere with its<br>northern hemisphere<br>equivalent superimposed on the inverted<br>antipodes the latitude of the south<br>island of new zand aligns with Northern<br>in central Italy the north AR was<br>Central Spain and Northland with Morocco<br>in North<br>Africa the entire United Kingdom which<br>you probably won't recognize upside down<br>like that but it's down the bottom of<br>the slide experiences significantly<br>lower<br>uvr with respect to Seasons there is a<br>further significant difference in that<br>New Zealand experiences Peak summer<br>athal or sunb burning ultraviolet levels<br>that are about 40% higher than those<br>that equivalent Northern Hemisphere<br>latitudes this difference broadly<br>indicated along the extended uvr scale<br>down the bottom here one up to the other<br>end um is due to a combination of<br>factors and these include the lack of<br>atmospheric pollution that I mentioned<br>earlier but also the elliptical orbit of<br>the<br>Earth this means that the sun is<br>relatively closer during the southern<br>hemisphere summer and this is the period<br>when because of the axial tilt of the<br>Earth the sunlight strikes us most<br>directly this of course it's a bit<br>exaggerated but it does prove the point<br>I<br>think and finally uvr levels vary by<br>time of day according to the S Zenith<br>angle or the height of the Sun in the<br>sky the consequences of this are<br>demonstrated in the original<br>Australian alert bell curve here if you<br>can see the time of day along the bottom<br>here and and the T the levels of UV<br>along the side<br>there it's informative this diagram I<br>think about the science behind uvr<br>variation throughout the day unlike<br>helped I'm sad to say I think the New<br>Zealand one the orange and black alert<br>it's a sort of a dumbed Down version<br>which is clearly not correct because it<br>s to suggests that the risk is the same<br>throughout the day whereas in fact we<br>know it isn't fortunately a more<br>um better designed alternative uh has<br>now been designed by uh Richard McKenzie<br>and people at Nea and promoted by him<br>and the Cancer Society and that's an app<br>that you can download um available for<br>Android and other devices<br>now now on<br>the o go left hand side of this Slide<br>the seasonal variation in mean and U<br>Peak UV levels that's the um the peak<br>ones at the top and the mean ones down<br>the bottom and the place to stand the<br>left hand side there you can see that<br>the highest levels in the northern<br>regions as you expect and the lowest<br>levels in the South inago Sarah down<br>here make sure you keep it on the on the<br>screen um at the right hand side of the<br>screen are the levels of ambient or<br>athal UV that's according to the um<br>internationally agreed ultraviolet index<br>from the green at the top the low<br>levels uh to the purple the extreme<br>levels at the bottom and the index<br>values are associated with particular<br>risk to of harm to humans from<br>unprotected exposure and the scales I<br>said extends from low through to high or<br>extreme in fact as they term it now this<br>uvr exposure involves an energy transfer<br>from the Sun to the skin and excess<br>exposure is essentially a type of<br>radiation burn an injury with potential<br>short and long-term outcomes and<br>cumulative<br>effects so it can be useful to view skin<br>cancer in terms of Haden's injury<br>prevention Matrix to help structure and<br>guide efforts to reduce the negative<br>impact of excess exposure by extending<br>the classical epidemiological tread of<br>an agent here uvr a host um that's the<br>affected person and a disease here skin<br>cancer and to also include uh<br>sociocultural factors in the physical<br>environment and stages in the process<br>too with sunburn as the event to be<br>avoided the skin cancer primary<br>prevention focuses on pre-event and<br>event areas and the the cells in those<br>areas um and I would say this model has<br>proved useful in conceptualizing injury<br>prevention and given that John Langley<br>in who was the director of the ipu when<br>was my primary PhD supervisor I've not<br>been able to forget<br>it in a paper appropriately entitled on<br>The Escape of tigers Haden also<br>described 10 productive strategies<br>against harmful energy transfers the<br>first of these was to prevent the<br>creation of a hazard in the first place<br>which would applied to<br>cfc's but as I mentioned earlier but two<br>of the others are most relevant here one<br>is what we call separation in time and<br>space for example rescheduling outdoor<br>activities outside P uvr periods and the<br>second is the use of material barriers<br>for example shade structures clothing<br>and<br>sunscreen I stay with this slide for a<br>while because too much stuff to put on<br>it otherwise um so I'll just speak to it<br>Haden also promoted the idea of<br>distinguishing measures along an active<br>passive Dimension the active ones that<br>require people to do something in order<br>for their personal protection to be<br>determined for example putting on on<br>some protective hat and sunscreen before<br>going Outdoors whereas the passive ones<br>provide Collective protection through<br>prior planning for example shade<br>structures provided by the organizers<br>responsible for outdoor public<br>events generally speaking the passive<br>measures tend to be the most effective<br>for example the shade structure can<br>time we know that a number of readily<br>available barriers can reduce uvr<br>exposure for example Peter Gees of the<br>Australian radiation protection and<br>nuclear safety agency has demonstrated<br>the protectiveness of Broad brind and<br>bucket hats and in contrast the limited<br>protection afforded<br>by the um caps particularly the ones<br>without flaps that shade the neck and<br>ears now these caps can effectively<br>reduce eye glare and Dazzle and promote<br>corporate logos but without the flaps<br>they should never be recommended for<br>cancer<br>prevention shade is readily potential<br>modifiable physical environmental factor<br>and that can be vegetation natural<br>physical phography topography or<br>permanent demandable or adjustable shade<br>a uvr can be received directly from the<br>solar<br>disc or scattered indirectly from the<br>sky or reflected from terrestrial<br>surfaces in some circumstances more than<br>half of the uvi that we receive reaches<br>us indirectly there's this um elegant<br>diagram by Christina maai from the<br>constructed the optimal design and<br>placement of shade requires professional<br>input but the basic principle and a<br>range of examples were described and the<br>sadly underutilized under cover<br>guidelines published by the Cancer<br>Society however both the provision and<br>the the use of shade as cancer<br>prevention strategies are influenced by<br>sociocultural factors such as<br>institutional policies and social<br>norms other research has demonstrated<br>how clothing coverage can effectively<br>reduce uvr exposure and Adel green and<br>colleagues have demonstrated that<br>sunscreen provides a protective barrier<br>that can prevent the development of sun<br>skin<br>cancers sorry about this being a bit<br>blurry but it's the original one from<br>1986<br>the original otoa CH it's a health<br>promotion model which many of you<br>particularly Louise than here will be<br>very familiar with and I say that it's<br>very compatible with the Haden Matrix is<br>sort of reinforcing a systematic<br>approach to guiding responses to a<br>problem for example there's a need to<br>design support of outdoor<br>environments<br>um so they can provide Collective shade<br>protection to create social and cultural<br>environments that are supportive of some<br>protective practices for example through<br>institutional policies and practices and<br>to support education and development of<br>personal skools that is we the hosts can<br>be appropriately protective both of<br>ourselves and those in our care all of<br>these components are best treated as<br>mutually<br>reinforcing the desired preventive<br>outcome is more likely to result from<br>taking a comprehensive approach that<br>addresses multiple strates in as many CS<br>of the headen Matrix as I showed as<br>possible and this is why such a<br>systematic comprehensive perspective can<br>be so valuable for informing and guiding<br>a comprehensive scientific approach to<br>primary<br>prevention with respect to host factors<br>although uvr exposure triggers tanning<br>responses in skin cells this is not<br>sufficient for physiological self-<br>protection most notably among the<br>lighter colored skin types for whom<br>excess exposure can lead to athema or<br>sunburn easily<br>occurring now it's also important to<br>remember that the exposure of human skin<br>to the UVB band of radiation also<br>triggers the endogenous or personal<br>production of vitamin d That's essential<br>for skle health excess production of<br>vitamin D is ingeniously avoided as the<br>process goes into reverse when levels<br>begin to exceed what are physiologically<br>desirable the 2012 uh consensus<br>statement up in the top corner there um<br>describes how by using a combination of<br>shade clothing cover and sunscreen when<br>the uvi is three or above healthy<br>vitamin D levels can be maintained from<br>relatively brief exposure times while<br>harmful excess uvr exposure can be<br>avoided a uvi of three is the trigger<br>level identified by The<br>Who when atris groups should adopt some<br>protective practices so the goal is to<br>approximate to the point B in Robin<br>Lucas's diagram here<br>um unfortunately the peak experience of<br>discomfort from overexposure to uvr<br>experienced as red sore or blistered<br>skin is delayed for 24 hours or more<br>reducing the likelihood of any<br>behavioral avoidance response to protect<br>against DNA damage that occurs and is<br>linked with the later emergence of skin<br>cancer whereas we immediately seek to<br>avoid the Dazzle experienced from<br>visible light we do not respond<br>similarly to excessive uvr because it's<br>invisible most to the human eye and the<br>experience of physical discomfort isay<br>is delayed as I said similarly during<br>high temperatures we tend to respond<br>more quickly and behaviorally to seeking<br>out by seeking out cool shade as do<br>other<br>species I often wonder whether the pilot<br>is still in there waiting to come out or<br>is trying to get back<br>but now in Equatorial regions high<br>temperatures around solar noon are<br>associated with the highest levels of<br>uvr so SE seeking shade to avoid<br>overheating also provides protection<br>against athema but in more temperate<br>regions like in New Zealand while the<br>uvi may be relatively High the<br>temperature May simultaneously be quite<br>cool and therefore not elicit a<br>protective shade seeking response and<br>this is why the provision of warm shade<br>is so important in New<br>Zealand now in the pre-event host cells<br>of the Haden Matrix the key population<br>level Factor affecting potential human<br>impact of uvr skin type particularly<br>vulnerable are those with the lighter<br>colored skin types adapted for the<br>northern mid to high latitudes where uvi<br>low in terms of uvr exposure the New<br>Zealand European resident population<br>could reasonably be defined as a<br>climatically displaced one given the<br>large differences in uvi between New<br>Zealand and the is in the northern<br>ancestry so a substantial proportion of<br>the resident New Zealand population is<br>potentially exposed to seasonal levels<br>of uvr significantly higher than those<br>experienced by their recent ancestors so<br>a clear and comprehensive program of<br>policies and practices for primary<br>prevention is well<br>Justified migration studies indicate<br>that moving from a relatively low to a<br>relatively High uvr environment before<br>adulthood significantly increases the<br>risk of melanoma among those with fair<br>skin this suggests that early life<br>exposure May trigger initiation<br>processes that increase later skin<br>cancer risk so although excessive uvr<br>exposure any time of life increases risk<br>protection early in life is probably<br>particularly important and we're coming<br>back to this<br>later with respect to sociocultural<br>factors a key factor in this process is<br>body clothing coverage or skin exposed<br>during outdoor work social and<br>recreational activities quite radical<br>normative changes occurred in clothing<br>during 20th century and Western cultures<br>with body clothing coverage reduced<br>substantially amongst both males and<br>females During the period of a singal<br>lifetime this postcard view is of<br>recreational activities of Clair Beach<br>and denen from the hawen library<br>Collections and it dates from around 190<br>six as does this one here see the use of<br>hats and parasols and covering clothing<br>was<br>routine the significant changes in body<br>coverage from about 1910 to 1980 are<br>well summarized in these photographs of<br>us participants in sports and<br>recreational activities 1910 at the<br>top now taking account of a latency<br>period of as much as 40 years the New<br>Zealand cancer registry statistics of<br>malignant melanoma skin cancer show a<br>remarkable pattern of steady increase<br>from its Baseline in<br>1948 note the peak around uh here is an<br>artificial one because of the<br>requirement and new legislation to<br>register meom at that time but the<br>steady increase you can see continues<br>through although a fraction of this<br>observed increase may be attributable to<br>better case identif identic ation<br>identification in recent times the<br>relative visibility of skin cancers is<br>likely to minimize that<br>effect so in<br>2012 the year for which we have the most<br>recent data melanoma was the third most<br>commonly registered cancer amongst both<br>Zealand and using the international<br>Agency for research on can's comparable<br>statistics internationally we see that<br>New Zealand is the world leader in age<br>standardized melanoma registrations and<br>fatalities overall when male and female<br>rates per 100,000 are<br>combined the gender specific rates are<br>more than double those for the US and<br>the UK and earlier this year Prof um<br>David Whitman came from Australia and<br>told us that our rates had overtaken<br>those that reported in<br>Australia but the overall skin cancer<br>burden is actually far greater than this<br>because many types of skin cancers known<br>as cartinos cancers although much more<br>much less likely to be fatal are far<br>more common and place a substantial<br>burden on the New Zealand community in<br>terms of health system economic and<br>personal<br>costs these New Zealand skin cancer cost<br>data are 10 years out of date<br>unfortunately no one seen fit to fund an<br>update of these statistic so um we can't<br>accurately quantify the total skin<br>cancer burden at the moment it's almost<br>as though no one wants to know but I<br>believe there are some studies in<br>Wellington here at University OFA that<br>might be helping in this<br>respect now to put this burden in<br>respective in perspective the uh the 486<br>deaths here from all skin cancers<br>um Compares in the same year to 308<br>deaths from road traffic crashes that<br>year that is 178 more deaths and a<br>comparison like this made in Sweden<br>produced a similar finding and was used<br>there to motivate prioritization of skin<br>cancer prevention something we could<br>think of doing<br>here because of the large number of<br>people affected an estimated 67,000 per<br>year in the the kinoite cancers the<br>conservative estimate of total treatment<br>cost other than melanoma is around 10<br>sorry around 10 times that for melanoma<br>as you can see down the bottom here now<br>of course this doesn't take into account<br>the recent costly drugs for treating<br>melanoma<br>now the saddest thing about all this is<br>that this burden of Health System cost<br>and personal suffering borne by the new<br>preventable we know that Ultra radiation<br>is carcinogenic to humans iak classified<br>it that way several years<br>ago we understand the causal<br>Pathways that lead to skin cancer<br>making preventive interventions<br>worthwhile we know that 90% of melanomas<br>and 95% of non-melanoma skin cancers are<br>potentially preventable and reduced uvr<br>can reduce the number of Nei which may<br>lead to melanoma solar keratosis and<br>screamous cell<br>carcinoma and limiting exposure during<br>High summer uvr is the most important<br>strategy the plausibility of increased<br>vulnerability to Basil cell carcinoma<br>melanoma from early life exposure and<br>that's where the potential greatest<br>gains are lik to be<br>made so there's potential for prevention<br>by targeting modifiable environment<br>behavioral and risk<br>factors sorry about that rather dense<br>slide but I think it's important to go<br>things and knowing the conditions that<br>put many new zealanders at high risk and<br>following the prompts provided by the<br>Haden Matrix and the Ottawa Charter<br>models a comprehensive program of<br>feasibility feasibly protective<br>environmental socio cultural and<br>behavioral strategies can be identified<br>but are the intervention programs that<br>incorporate such strategies effective in<br>changing protective practices when<br>implemented in order to investigate this<br>question a series of systematic reviews<br>has been undertaken and since 2011 Bron<br>no and I at University of TGO have been<br>privileged to be included in the review<br>team this rather busy slide sorry about<br>that it shows a modified version we've<br>created of the analytic framework that's<br>used for this review and looking at<br>educational behavioral individual<br>focused um strategies looking at<br>institutional Focus environmental and<br>policy regulation and looking<br>particularly um the behaviors limited<br>listed in in box 3 here is the um<br>outcomes that we want to see changes in<br>those<br>practices and eventually of course<br>changes in these outcomes in boxes four<br>five and six longer<br>term given the often long latency period<br>few Studies have been able to follow up<br>right through until skin cancer outcomes<br>but many Studies have looked at<br>behavioral changes and some have been<br>able to look at intermediate Health<br>outcomes this review focuses only on<br>Behavior and health related outcomes as<br>these ones here and not on attitudes<br>knowledge and beliefs in the<br>um second box there because the lack of<br>clear Association of these things with<br>desired behavioral<br>outcomes now the revie review Focus has<br>six settings and three broader<br>strategies that we're looking at that<br>cut across those settings and the<br>conclusions have been mostly positive<br>with five reviews concluding it was<br>Effectiveness if we look in Greater<br>detail at one of the settings for which<br>the evidence was determined as strong<br>and that is primary and Middle School<br>settings we can see the sorts of changes<br>achieved with respect to the outcomes of<br>interest in the leftand column here<br>these are things that we want to see<br>happen more use of these things less<br>sunburn less nevi avoidance of harm sun<br>exposure results consistently<br>demonstrated beneficial effects and some<br>of these changes were quite substantial<br>such as the two physiological outcomes<br>in red where the incidence of sunburn<br>and emergence of new nevi showed<br>significant reductions there these two<br>here and these were quite notable<br>findings from the review series overall<br>that's all the different um contexts and<br>settings some general conclusions going<br>to be drawn about what may help improve<br>intervention<br>Effectiveness and<br>these I guess a lot of them<br>are self-evident really you think it<br>through but it's important that there's<br>a significant sufficient level of<br>investment to have a program that the<br>program is of high enough intensity to<br>have an effect that it's program is<br>consistent and sustained over time and<br>you need to pay attention to how the<br>audiences that you're targeting the<br>program at how they're reached whether<br>through information provision or<br>something like a more persuasive<br>approach and it's important also to be<br>able to work through existing<br>organizational structures such as<br>workplaces in the review<br>Series so this will help guides to what<br>what's needed in New Zealand but getting<br>back to New Zealand and looking at the<br>Historical sort of development uh<br>responses to sin cancer here what's been<br>happening well we had very promising<br>initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s and<br>similar patterns of recommendations made<br>by um Professor Elwood and Helen glasgo<br>in the 1993 report and then by the<br>public health Commission in 1994 so more<br>than 20 years ago recommendations were<br>made for a comprehensive primary<br>prevention<br>program and school settings were<br>priority<br>the Public Health commission provided<br>some detail around how interventions in<br>schools could be assessed and evaluated<br>and improving the education sorry the<br>education in the school facilities to<br>moderate sun exposure keeping schools<br>aware of the resources available for in<br>their curriculum for Education<br>incentives um awarding certificates to<br>schools for adopting practices and<br>implementing policies and these sort of<br>things<br>um School practices and<br>policies this sounds a little bit out of<br>date now people don't like giving away<br>things anymore it's all user pays but<br>that was something that was mentioned at<br>the time that would lead to better use<br>in schools probably and the important<br>thing was to evaluate whatever program<br>was<br>introduced um probably by looking at the<br>increase in the percentage of schools<br>that adopted and implemented such<br>policies now a number of uh factors make<br>school-aged children and schools<br>important targets for skin cancer<br>prevention uh interventions early life<br>exposure as I mentioned earlier is a<br>plausible risk factor for skin cancers<br>and young people spend a considerable<br>amount of their time at school including<br>in breaks Recreation and Sport there are<br>opportunities for establishing some<br>protective institutional policies and<br>practices uh influencing School physical<br>environments<br>and having things in the curriculum<br>content that meet educational<br>obligations to inform of risk as well as<br>informing about scientific issues and so<br>on is the opportunity to increase<br>student knowledge and establish lifetime<br>normative some protective<br>behaviors and there's also a need to<br>meet Ministry of Education and er<br>administrative expectations regarding<br>safety and these um known as nags which<br>is a good short term for them national<br>Administrative guidelines there are<br>clear guidelines and expectations for<br>schools we had to um ensure that the<br>schools buildings and Facilities provide<br>a safe healthy learning environment nag<br>for and provide a safe physical and<br>emotional environment NE five and no it<br>doesn't specifically identify sun<br>protection these guidelines can be taken<br>to include the provision of adequate<br>shade and appropriate sun protection<br>practices for avoiding aemma and<br>prevention in the absence of any<br>explicit official efforts to routinely<br>ensure that schools for sun protective<br>institutions the cancer society's<br>Sunmart schools accreditation program<br>aimed to fill the Gap and was launched<br>nationally in November 2005 with these<br>criteria here um in terms 1 and four<br>Guided by The Who recommendations for<br>program<br>comprehensiveness and at this point we<br>researchers took up the challenge to<br>assess School sun protection practices<br>and policies and<br>environments but since all divisions of<br>the Cancer Society were Keen to<br>immediately and comprehensively<br>implement the program we were not able<br>to randomly select a control group they<br>were so keen and it's hard to explain to<br>people that need but never mind we did<br>identify a random sample to assess a<br>Baseline and almost 80% of those schools<br>um were followed up four years<br>selecting roughly a 10%<br>sample now as the bar chart here<br>illustrates we found an increase in the<br>highest scoring group of schools and in<br>the table at the bottom um a<br>statistically significant uh positive<br>shift in the total accreditation scores<br>from 2005 to 2009 when we followed them<br>up<br>however only just over 4% of schools met<br>2009 when we rank the percentage of<br>schools attaining each accreditation<br>component the top Red Bar shows almost<br>40% of schools had not yet developed sun<br>protection policies we identified three<br>other areas the other red areas down the<br>bottom most requiring attention in order<br>to get schools over the line that's<br>integration of sun protection practices<br>into the um curriculum shade provision<br>clothing there have been some<br>improvements in three low attainment<br>areas of clothing shade provision and<br>curriculum content as these figures here<br>show um but no more than 11% Improvement<br>at the best over that period of<br>time it's also instructive to see that<br>acknowledgement of program promotion<br>from by the cancer Society health<br>promotion staff schools that<br>acknowledged that actually perform<br>better statistically significantly<br>better we drew some conclusions from<br>these the shortcomings that were noted<br>with respect to clothing um it was the<br>Criterion reported least often in New<br>Zealand schools and not only at the<br>Baseline but four years later it's 43%<br>this is in sharp contrast with<br>Australian schools where clothing use is<br>the Criterion most frequently mentioned<br>96% they<br>report so this requires working with<br>designers manufacturers and Distributors<br>to make clothing more affordable and<br>practical and collaboration with<br>students and<br>caregivers so that the products are<br>acceptable um this is a slide of some<br>Danish students before the summer months<br>were preparing they had a project to<br>prepar some protective<br>hats it's something that we could<br>perhaps introduce in New Zealand as well<br>but I'm not sure they'd be well they may<br>pretty effective quite nice to look at<br>too regarding shade provision<br>um we thought that required greater<br>financial support and incentives this is<br>probably a key Point actually there's<br>need for professional support for<br>optimal design and placement of shade<br>and there's need to implement shade<br>audits in schools to see what's going on<br>we gave a presentation to the Ministry<br>of Education property and infrastructure<br>staff about this and subsequently the<br>Cancer Society had dialogue and<br>correspondence with the minister and<br>officials and received a ministerial<br>letter acknowledging the need for shade<br>in future building of<br>schools particularly uh being undertaken<br>in Christ Church at the time but we're<br>progress there's a wide range of<br>structures that could be built more<br>widely this was sort of time out for<br>students who were not wearing<br>hats um this quite a a nice Branda which<br>provides warm<br>shade another Veranda where excludes<br>this High sun shade high level Sun from<br>the seats and allows low level sun in<br>Winter to get<br>in and a covered area for a a sand pit<br>and Ryan G provided me with this slide<br>study that's going on at the moment<br>covered Outdoor Learning areas colas is<br>different sort of cola to the one that<br>you<br>drink but very effective for providing a<br>light and protected<br>area there's also natural shade of<br>course with respect to curriculum<br>resources where there was a need to<br>improve the accessibility of them and to<br>integrate them better into the<br>curriculum structure and to promote them<br>more to schools and teaching scaf and<br>also we have to note it's just positive<br>that was good progress was made with<br>developing resources for levels 1 to<br>four that's years 1 to n up to secondary<br>level and but this was paid for and<br>developed an association with<br>educational contractors by the Cancer<br>Society and made available online in<br>July<br>2014 Ministry of Education found them<br>very useful I think but didn't<br>cost<br>so these curriculum resources are<br>cross-curricular they cover numeracy<br>literacy health and science they explain<br>science Concepts and experiences of the<br>sun energy and sun protection and they<br>focus on students learning and using<br>behaviors that will keep them from<br>exposing their skin to excessive levels<br>of uvr and teachers can either use a<br>full unit um in a school term or use a<br>single<br>lesson<br>now returning to the sunart schools<br>accreditation program in general<br>following the criteria that we used in<br>2009 only 4.2% of schools of Primary<br>students at that time me all met all 12<br>criteria but by 12 by 2015 just over 35%<br>of schools that's down at the bottom<br>here primary schools were accredited by<br>the Cancer Society but with a<br>substantially lower proportion in the<br>more populous ockland region where the<br>uvi levels tend to be rich higher level<br>for longer these figures shouldn't be<br>taken to reflect negatively on health<br>promoters efforts because without<br>significantly greater investment in<br>particular given the cost of shade it<br>will be difficult to extend the program<br>universally and equitably throughout un<br>Zealand<br>because just the costs involved the<br>appropriate source of this greater<br>investment should be really property<br>school property infrastructure funds and<br>without that despite heroic Community<br>fundraising efforts many schools are<br>likely to be unable to be accredited<br>however well a dedicated Cancer Society<br>staff promote this program and many<br>primary schools will fail to melt health<br>and safety nags four and<br>five it should be clear that the<br>ultimate responsibility for this lies<br>with the Ministry of Education and the<br>education review<br>office now recently we carried out a<br>baseline survey of 21 secondary schools<br>we found that only 50% had a written sun<br>protection policy and when we assess<br>their reported sun protection practices<br>according to 11 criteria down the down<br>the side here um similar to the ones<br>used for primary schools I want to draw<br>attention to three key<br>observations first when ranked the<br>percentage of schools reaching its<br>Criterion clearly indicated four areas<br>of what you could call in educational<br>terminology low<br>achievement and this we reduce this to<br>three areas when we combine the breakes<br>and events plans together so clo shade<br>clothing and outdoor<br>events the shade C is again is the is<br>met and when we constructed a simple<br>additive total sun protection score the<br>mean overall score in the top right hand<br>panel the green panel up here was quite<br>modest just under five out of a possible<br>score of 11 and 65% of schools scor<br>scored five or<br>criteria when all the known School<br>demographic characteristics were<br>adjusted for two statistically<br>significant predictors of higher scores<br>stood at one was being a school that<br>included primary classes like some of<br>the larger Rural and district<br>schools and such schools presumably have<br>continuity in the Suns Smite program so<br>that's a logical and feasible<br>finding we also found that being a<br>school that had a Sunsmart<br>policy was predictive of better<br>schools so we concluded that effort<br>should focus on those things development<br>of a policy in all<br>schools and encouraging links with<br>primary classes not necessarily in the<br>same school but with other schools<br>around so<br>the program could be given some<br>continuity and we also concluded that<br>efforts needed to be focused on shade<br>provision some protective clothing and<br>breaks<br>outoor event<br>planning and also finally to develop<br>continuity with the established primary<br>level curriculum develop that into the<br>secondary school levels to make it<br>Universal Equitable and a sustainable<br>program and again the Regulatory<br>Agencies need to accept responsibility<br>for ensuring the appropriate sun<br>protection policies and practices are in<br>all public schools and they meet those<br>guidelines my con colleague BR mnau<br>recently carried out an observational<br>study in 11 Secondary School sports days<br>in denen which confirmed a generally<br>poor level of some protective practices<br>many students had no alternative to<br>standing around in the Sun for long<br>periods while waiting to compete in<br>their events um and fewer than 5%<br>actually were wearing some protective<br>hats while they were waiting around only<br>about half of the schools provided<br>sunscreen to students attending these<br>outdoor events yet the UV at the time<br>was more than double the level at which<br>use sun protection is recommended by The<br>Who okay now taking a step back from<br>detail about schools I want to comment<br>more broadly about the current situation<br>it affects all places outdoor work<br>Recreation Sports fluts and so<br>on in 2012 the US epidemiologist Deane<br>lazovich said it's time to get serious<br>about skin cancer prevention and in 2014<br>the US Surgeon General issued a call to<br>action to prevent skin<br>cancer acknowledging that skin cancer<br>was a serious Public Health concern that<br>we cannot ignore time for a<br>comprehensive approach to prevent it and<br>the word prevention cannot be emphasized<br>enough we can truly have a significant<br>impact on skin cancer related illness<br>death and health care costs was his<br>conclusion and this is backed up by an<br>editorial in the leading um medical<br>journal the Lancet from the UK saying<br>that when a cure is still a long way<br>away all efforts should be concentrated<br>on<br>prevention unfortunately we have hav<br>heard cools like this in New<br>Zealand another thing that's really<br>important to take into account is<br>that is an<br>increase in cancers and in Australia<br>this has been well documented we don't<br>have such good data in new on quite a<br>significant four-fold increase over that<br>period of time in<br>Australia and in the US the skin cancer<br>treatment costs have increased 126%<br>between 2002 to 6 period in 2007<br>to1 and the annual spend increased more<br>rapidly for skin cancers than any other<br>cancers in a review of 16 studies and 11<br>cost Effectiveness studies the mind<br>boggles it's hard work doing all that<br>stuff um they found Australia and New<br>Zealand had the highest direct Public<br>Health System skin cancer treatment<br>costs of all<br>countries and they also recent Studies<br>have shown that skin cancer prevention<br>initiatives are highly costeffective Ive<br>investing Australia in $5 million a year<br>would save 40 million after a 10year<br>program and at least $350 Australian<br>saved for every $1 invested in a<br>Sunsmart program<br>there but we lack New Zealand investment<br>and yet we have a proportionately<br>greater resource loss given the much<br>higher skin cancer rates that we have<br>than say example in the<br>US<br>so we in New Zealand should focus more<br>on primary prevention because as I've<br>said more than 90% of skin cancers are<br>considered<br>preventable and with the world's highest<br>International melanom incidence rates<br>New Zealand has much to gain from Prime<br>prevention more than anyone<br>else the best avenues for reducing the<br>burden of metoma in New Zealand for<br>example two epidemiologists concluded uh<br>prevention of excessive sun exposure and<br>early<br>diagnosis other researchers have noticed<br>that the higher numbers of non-melanoma<br>skin cancers that's the old terminology<br>that they may actually be increasing in<br>numbers though we don't have that well<br>documented yet and they're very high<br>skin cancer treatment cost to the health<br>system and also high cost personal costs<br>to those who are<br>affected so primary prevention<br>interventions can be effective and cost<br>effective we know that<br>now<br>perhaps we should focus on what we<br>really need to do we need to acknowledge<br>again that it's time to get serious<br>about skin cancer prevention in New<br>Zealand we need to follow the surgeon<br>general's lead and identify skin cancer<br>as a serious Public Health concern we<br>cannot ignore we need to invest in<br>prevention to reduce avoidable suffering<br>and conserve future spending on<br>treatment and this funding could be<br>spent on other things in the health<br>system we need to initiate a high<br>profile program to guide New Zealand<br>institutions and this program should be<br>adequately funded sustained long-term<br>well-coordinated Co comprehensive and<br>consistent and this should affect not<br>only schools<br>workplaces um Sports grounds cancer<br>facilities anything associated with UV<br>exposure and there needs to be a<br>demonstration of effective leadership in<br>New Zealand in Australia they banned<br>some bids here we're still dithering<br>about the legislation after 2 years of<br>discussion and this is a<br>no-brainer otherwise if we don't do<br>these things New Zealand risk continuing<br>to be a world leader in a preventable<br>disease rather than a world leader in<br>prevention and we hope that these<br>children from s's Bay school and den<br>Eden will go forward through a happy and<br>healthy adult life because of this<br>unsmart school and take a note from<br>these um surf lifes<br>Savers looking into the future and being<br>well protected in their<br>Activity thank<br>you oh well thank you very much Tony for<br>a very informative uh lecture this<br>evening uh and and I think it's a<br>tribute uh to you that even though it<br>some very simple uh practical Solutions<br>it's very poignant that we are moving<br>into summer and we should take notice of<br>them and I also uh was very interested<br>in what we would term in government your<br>social investment model uh costing out<br>uh you know the cost of prevention<br>versus the cost of treatment so uh thank<br>you very much for that so we've got time<br>for some Q&amp;A you might want to come back<br>up here I don't plan on answering the<br>questions um where would anyone like to<br>to kick off yeah sorry I'll move out of<br>your<br>way thank you very much for the nice<br>presentation um I'm my question is by<br>looking at this picture you know like<br>okay we have protected their head and<br>the face what about their arms you know<br>is so there's a possibility there sorry<br>you get microphone<br>there's a possibility they can be<br>wearing sunscreen because it's very<br>difficult to actually tell from<br>photographs where people are wearing<br>sunscreen i' have to go up and take<br>swabs off their arms to see but they're<br>actually doing quite well compared to a<br>lot of schools and if they are wearing<br>sunscreen they're pretty well protected<br>that<br>um it it is<br>um impossible to find sun hats in New<br>Zealand with protection for the neck<br>have you any comments on that<br>please yeah I think it's very<br>unfortunate that these uh caps that have<br>got very wide uses and covered in<br>corporate logos and promoted and worn by<br>an our Olympic team in Brazil what a bad<br>example that was when they could have<br>been wearing<br>broadb and you<br>know caps with necks um coverage that<br>would roll up and down and I don't mean<br>on the field but I mean they were<br>spending a lot of time off the field<br>what a what a poor example that was<br>looking back they didn't have very good<br>advice I think about that so it it's<br>really sad that there isn't the<br>promotion of the broad brand bucket hats<br>and the um legioner type hats and new on<br>there so such a high profile given to<br>the um yotti um ped cap which is<br>basically for protecting the eyes from<br>Dazzle and glare and so you can see what<br>you're doing it doesn't protect any<br>virtually no protection for the neck and<br>the cheeks and so on and when these are<br>areas which are very high frequency can<br>areas uh Koto uh Shane nahu from the<br>Cancer Society New Zealand um firstly I<br>just like to say thank you very much<br>Tony for the wonderful presentation and<br>also the uh the longstanding<br>relationship you've had with the society<br>um your wisdom and mentoring has been<br>very much appreciated over a number of<br>years um I think you made some very<br>valid points uh around where skin cancer<br>prevention sits in the New Zealand<br>landscape and unfortunately I think um<br>it's not as high-profile in priority as<br>we would like it to be um your strategy<br>points I think are all well made and<br>well known KN the challenge that we all<br>face I think is actually then how do we<br>transition this into a policy response I<br>think there's a role of a number of<br>agencies here including government um<br>including border trustees um and we the<br>Cancer Society obviously are very a key<br>um stakeholder in this um what I'd like<br>to um work with uh yourself and others<br>is actually how we Braden that that<br>stakeholder grouping because at the<br>moment really unlike most other cancers<br>um skin cancer has I mean ultraviolet um<br>exposure it's really it's skin cancer<br>and some eye issues there nothing else<br>un like smoking there's a whole lot of<br>other related health issues so there's a<br>whole lot of other people interested so<br>it's how we generate the um the urgency<br>behind this and sun sun burns more than<br>just a red face how do we make that<br>evident for<br>people yes it's been this area has been<br>something it's bit like trying to push a<br>heavy Barrow uphill actually where it's<br>some other things seem to get traction<br>easier this is something that doesn't<br>seem to have got traction although we've<br>had the uh leadership way back in the<br>1990s about what what should be done and<br>we had a a cancer control strategy which<br>identified skin cancer as being a<br>priority and then somehow that dropped<br>off the list and there's been a high<br>priority for example for uh drugs for<br>treating melanoma patient it's in the<br>advanced stages of Melanoma which is<br>quite appropriate they you know that<br>they should have the best drugs that are<br>available but it needs to have a<br>strategy that stretches across the the<br>whole cancer control Continuum you know<br>from prevention early detection through<br>of treatment and it's been it's pro at<br>present it's very unbalanced the<br>investment is all in the ambulance at<br>the bottom of the cliff and nothing the<br>guard rails at the top of the cliff<br>virtually nothing and of course the<br>Cancer Society is the virtually the only<br>agency that spends any money in this<br>area um the health promotion agency has<br>done some good work but their funding<br>has been reduced steadily over the years<br>and even recently it's been cut back<br>again in the area of of um skin cancer<br>prevention which is very disappointing<br>but I think there is an opportunity<br>later this year for when the uh skin<br>cancer I was forget the name of it early<br>detection and primary<br>prevention committee working group<br>whatever it's called meets later this<br>year I think it's next month we're<br>preparing some documentation for them<br>now actually there may be an opportunity<br>to develop some of those things you're<br>thinking about through that strategy and<br>and build those links um with you know<br>like I say Boards of Trustees employers<br>sports groups all sorts of groups so<br>that that's a possibility I think and<br>summer yes hi there this has been a very<br>interesting talk um I lost my father to<br>squamous cancer and um I'm so covered up<br>most of the time I take vitamin D<br>tablets um I've been reading a bit and<br>I've got a bit confused now I think um<br>you're saying that we've got mostly UVA<br>and some UV B am I right that you know<br>the shorter the wavelength the worse it<br>is for cancer but what about the story<br>for vitamin D and um can we get a<br>sunscreen that's really effective for<br>skin cancer but doesn't take a further<br>toll on trying to get enough vitamin D<br>it's very tricky actually because the um<br>the biologically sort of active areas<br>the the the part of the spectrum that<br>produces endogenous production of<br>vitamin D from action on the skin is<br>also pretty close mostly overlapping<br>with the area that of the spectrum<br>produces athema so when you you're<br>blocking one you tend to block the other<br>so that that sorry which one is that<br>again that produces that's mainly the<br>UVB but also some in the in the UVA part<br>of the spectrum as well so that it is a<br>challenge so personally I I would say<br>that people who<br>um think they're low on vitamin D it<br>take a supplement it's an easy thing to<br>do it's a harmless thing to do it's very<br>hard to get um sufficient vitamin D from<br>your ordinary nutrition he'd have to eat<br>like more eggs than you can imagine um<br>so yes take him a supplement and there<br>are like little sprays I found something<br>the other day you know just spray every<br>morning you got a thousand international<br>units um but of course the these things<br>tend to be inequitable across the<br>population so people going best afford<br>to do these things and a best educated<br>tend to do them which works against the<br>people who are you know disadvantage in<br>some way that's a difficulty there's a<br>sort of a challenging area around here I<br>agree may I just ask a quick<br>supplementary uh as a mother of um two<br>small children uh when when you go to<br>play centers and EC uh kind of the the<br>catchphrase is don't put sunscreen on<br>your child before 11 let the go out in<br>the sun and then put sunscreen on your<br>child um given you put up some lovely<br>graphs with all of the<br>variables um with respect to preventions<br>and and exposures to to skin cancer<br>what what practically if you're not<br>taking<br>supplements should you do is that<br>correct advice or<br>is<br>well it's important to get some<br>exposures to the sun um but as you get<br>as people get older and particularly in<br>in advanced old age the process of of<br>making vitamin D Isn't So efficient so<br>those elderly people definitely need<br>supplements um but earlier in life it's<br>it's important to get some exposure and<br>that's the sort of catch here some of<br>these children might be getting some s<br>exposure on their arms which from point<br>of view of vitamin D I don't know the<br>time of day here we can work it out from<br>the Shadows probably Ryan will probably<br>be able to calculate that but um it's<br>important to have some exposure and<br>probably earlier in in the morning would<br>be a good time as what what they don't<br>want is for parents necessarily to put<br>the sunscreen on before they leave to go<br>to to school or to their ECE because<br>they don't get any exposure at all and<br>they might if they don't have it on<br>early but put it on around that sort of<br>time or whatever time they think is<br>appropriate because they're probably<br>looking at the uvi levels um but it's<br>good to have that exposure at the time<br>that's at least risk<br>okay k um Tony thank you very much it's<br>Louis signal from University of otago<br>thanks so much for that uh incredibly<br>thorough uh walk through what is I think<br>agree greatly neglected area in this<br>country and and like Shane I think that<br>we do need to try and broaden the uh um<br>Coalition if you like of uh people uh<br>understanding just how urgent this is<br>and what actions are needed to be taken<br>we at the University are uh in the<br>business of doing research as as as as<br>you know and I wonder what research<br>agenda you might want to suggest for us<br>going<br>forward I think there's a real lack in<br>New Zealand of um like rigorous<br>quantitative research in these areas<br>actually in fact as you know I'm part of<br>the review team working with a CDC in<br>Atlanta looking at research and one of<br>the distressing things is we look<br>through this huge of studies and you<br>find this has got faulty statistics this<br>is not designed well the sample wasn't<br>selected appropriately you know and so<br>you can't take a lot of um you know from<br>their conclusions so it's really<br>important that when you do things you do<br>things rigorously that the studies are<br>well designed the measures are valid and<br>reliable that you've got a large enough<br>sample for you do your statistical tests<br>and so on and so much research so much<br>effort is is wasted I find overseas<br>anyway and and not doing those things<br>and so if we're going to do things in<br>New Zealand we should do them well I<br>think that's the most important thing um<br>whatever funding we get we should use it<br>efficiently and we could we could choose<br>any areas to work in really it could be<br>in sports or and Recreation it could be<br>in in more in schools as as your as Ryan<br>and yourself are doing it could we<br>there's a big lack in workplaces at the<br>moment and of course we've got work safe<br>New Zealand which is something I I was<br>having a minister was going to come<br>along tonight actually so we could<br>develop a relationship with that the<br>need for sun protection in workplaces<br>and that being considered an important<br>protective practice that's another area<br>that's a real Gap in and we found in our<br>study of um workers in centrala where we<br>got them to wear UV dosimeters was the<br>first study of its kind actually<br>dosimeters designed by Nea and and worn<br>by a large sample of outdoor workers we<br>found that quite a lot of them actually<br>reached<br>their what what should be<br>called the maximum exposure that they<br>should have in in a matter of a few<br>day hello just wondering if you could<br>comment on the cost of sunscreen<br>particularly for lowincome um families<br>and um what sort of taxes do we impose<br>on sunscreens in New Zealand I'm not<br>sure about the tax situation actually<br>but um it was interesting you say that<br>because looking back at those<br>recommendations from 1994 I think it was<br>about low cost or subsidized sunscreen<br>in schools that was that was the reason<br>for saying that but things have gone<br>very Market orientated and user pays<br>since that sort of time there's been<br>quite a shift away from that but in<br>schools I think that's that's a<br>particular environment where something<br>like that could and should be done<br>really and early childhood centers<br>probably as as well because the there is<br>a risk that people get doubly<br>disadvantaged you know disadvantage to<br>start with and then if they can't do<br>these the things that you know probably<br>they know they should be doing they're<br>advantaged disadvantaged again so<br>they're doubly disadvantaged yeah I just<br>wonder why we don't have them available<br>um through know doctors and health<br>Outlets subsidized by here that's<br>something that definitely could be<br>promoted given given the scale of the<br>problem in New Zealand absolutely yeah C<br>more<br>as thank you very much um just wondering<br>um the studies that that you've<br>described seem to be sort of like every<br>3 years or every 5 years or something of<br>that sort are there um metrics that you<br>could suggest um which could be measured<br>perhaps annually to hold each government<br>each year responsible to say this is<br>what has happened positively or not are<br>there some key metrics to hold a<br>government responsible multiple times<br>during its tenure rather than only once<br>in its tenure thank you I would think<br>like um it's really the responsibility<br>of the education Review Office to to<br>assess these things in schools and it's<br>part of those nags four and five that<br>they should be assessing schools on sun<br>protection really practices in schools<br>so I don't know how frequently that the<br>ero gets round to each particular school<br>I think it's not that frequent that<br>actually but that's the sort of thing<br>that um would need to be done but also I<br>think it's important to keep track of<br>the number of schools that actually have<br>implemented policies because we found<br>that you know quite a low proportion of<br>schools actually had policies so that's<br>the first step to get a some protection<br>policy and then to keep them to that<br>policy you know and to monitor that<br>policy is on the ground is what's<br>actually happening so I think yes<br>getting the ER to take us on board more<br>and<br>also having some particular<br>encouragement some carrots and sticks<br>for schools to actually develop a policy<br>them not many years ago it was a sued<br>only wore hats is that a still a<br>prevalent attitude no I don't think so<br>you know not amongst the farmers and<br>sharers and outdoor workers who often<br>wear broad brm hats um it's it's it's<br>funny that shift in in fashion that the<br>hats have have gone out I've got a whole<br>pile of hats with him I've got about 20<br>different hats for different purposes<br>actually um I don't consider myself<br>particularly I just think it's<br>very practical and sensible and it's<br>actually very comfortable when you're<br>you're outside reducing the glare<br>reducing the burn and knowing you're<br>protecting yourself and actually there's<br>something quite attractive about a hat<br>that's well worn I think and you know<br>from those old photographs the ladies<br>and 1906 certainly knew this with these<br>beautiful broadb hats with flowers and<br>goodness know what all over I mean bring<br>it back bring bring the hats back for<br>goodness sake they're<br>beautiful good thank you oh look thank<br>you very much uh Tony again for that<br>very informative uh presentation and<br>thank you very much for your time and<br>answering those questions uh to all of<br>you in the theater here thank you very<br>much for those very intelligent<br>questions you'd be welcome and select<br>committee<br>anytime and thank you Helen for uh your<br>work and putting these series on it's<br>it's lovely to have you here in<br>Parliament and I look forward to next<br>year um hopefully you've got some plans<br>Helen and thank you um ilka for uh with<br>the mic running around she's disappeared<br>I think she's uh getting the<br>refreshments probably organized so<br>you're invited now um to go into the<br>East wing for some refreshments if you<br>didn't get to ask your question of Tony<br>I'm sure you can ACC costum um over a a<br>beverage or two and look thank you once<br>again Tony for your time thank you very<br>much for tuning up it's been a pleasure<br>and again a very very informative uh<br>lecture thank you very much for for<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
