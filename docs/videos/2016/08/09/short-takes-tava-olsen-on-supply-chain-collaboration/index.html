globalisation, and demanding customers.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I see three key challenges for Supply<br>chains today I see increased complexity<br>increased globalization and increasingly<br>demanding customers Supply chains today<br>are just more Interlink more companies<br>more suppliers more pieces to manage<br>more inter relationships just<br>fundamentally more complex they're also<br>more Global and that's obviously goes<br>along with this increased complexity so<br>when companies are thinking about<br>sourcing it's very rare for a product to<br>be made all in one country there'll be<br>pieces made in Europe and in China and<br>in India and and that all comes together<br>in the supply chain and then the<br>increasing customer demand we're used to<br>being able to find what we want so we<br>see shorter product Lifey Cycles more<br>product variety all of that makes the<br>supply chain more challenging to um uh<br>manage so collaboration brings the<br>win-win so what is a win-win it's when<br>you make more money and I make more<br>money when we're working together so how<br>does that happen usually that happens<br>through Better Contracting so for<br>example most Publishers offer bookstores<br>buyback contracts where the bookstore if<br>it doesn't sell the book can send it<br>back to the publisher with no cost so<br>why does the publisher do that so that<br>the bookstore actually stocks the book<br>because if they had to buy it and then<br>take all the risk of not selling it they<br>may not buy the book they may buy many<br>fewer uh so instead they do the buyb<br>contracts which means the retailer sells<br>more stocks more and therefore sells<br>more so where does the extra money in<br>the supply chain come from comes from<br>extra Book Sales right so we have more<br>money in the supply chain we just have<br>to figure out how to divvy it up so that<br>both the retailer and the supplier are<br>making more money and notice it's<br>actually not just win-win it's actually<br>win-win-win because now you've got happy<br>customers too they show up the book's on<br>the Shelf they get to buy it so three<br>wins through collaboration in this case<br>it's the form of a buyback contract but<br>there's lots of other ways there's<br>Revenue sharing comp contracts there's<br>vender managed inventory where the uh<br>manufacturer or the vendor is actually<br>managing the inventory on the Retailer's<br>shelf uh and it doesn't have to be<br>supplier retailer it can be any point<br>within the chain that you actually see<br>uh this sort of collaborative contracts<br>so collaboration has always been there<br>in some form but we see more of it these<br>days and part of that is simply it<br>systems allow a degree of transparency<br>that previously was based on trust so if<br>you think about something like a revenue<br>sharing contract where for every unit<br>you sell a piece of Revenue goes back to<br>the supplier well if it's all paper<br>based it's a lot easier to hide some of<br>those sales that go into the Retailer's<br>till and not not put the revenue back to<br>the supplier but when you've got it<br>systems that every single sale is<br>registered there's no way to hide your<br>revenue and therefore the supplier is<br>much more willing to take on a revenue<br>sharing contract because they they know<br>that they'll actually be getting their<br>fair share of the revenue because the<br>revenue is now extremely visible one<br>company that's really good at at some of<br>these collaborative ideas is Walmart<br>who's now the biggest the world's<br>biggest company in terms of Revenue and<br>they've grown from just a small<br>operation in the US and what they do is<br>they do a lot of using their data to<br>inform their suppliers they do some of<br>these vendor managed inventory contracts<br>so for example Coke and Pepsi actually<br>stock the shelves at Walmart I was in a<br>Walmart in the US I asked a question to<br>some guy and he says I don't know I work<br>for Coke and he was just there stocking<br>coke onto the onto the shelves uh so<br>they do that to allow this sort of<br>collaboration ation because then it<br>makes it easier for Coke to plan their<br>whole distribution route to go via you<br>know they can actually say okay I'm<br>going to do the north side of the city<br>on Mondays and the south side of the<br>city on Tuesdays rather than just<br>responding to orders as they come in<br>randomly when they control their own<br>inventory it's they can they can do much<br>better planning and then another Walmart<br>example was there was a particular type<br>of bug spray that was selling really<br>well in Florida and not selling in<br>Minnesota and they have the Data Systems<br>they can see this so then they looked<br>into it and they went oh this spray is<br>called flying roach killer well<br>cockroaches in Florida are a natural<br>part of living in Florida cockroaches in<br>Minnesota mean that you've got a really<br>dirty house so nobody's going to buy a<br>spray off the shelf that says flying<br>roach killer so Walmart was able to feed<br>that back to the bug spray provider who<br>then of course changed their labeling<br>for Minnesota they took off cockroaches<br>from all the labeling sales went up to<br>where they should have been and that was<br>all about Walmart working<br>collaboratively with its suppliers using<br>the data saying hey you've got a problem<br>with your sales in Minnesota because we<br>know what's happening that they it sales<br>well in Florida New Zealand is not very<br>good at collaboration unfortunately uh<br>there was a survey done by IBM and a few<br>years ago now that showed that 30% of<br>world leading companies actually work on<br>their sales planning with their<br>suppliers and then the figure for the<br>Australia New Zealand region was 8% so<br>when you know that's a big gap in terms<br>of performance and that's just on that<br>one piece of of involving your suppliers<br>with your planning process uh so we have<br>a lot of work to do uh and I think<br>there's a few things going on for<br>example I don't know if people actually<br>realize the benefits that can happen<br>from collaboration they think it's all<br>some they're a bit skeptical often I<br>don't think it's scale related uh I<br>think think partly it's maturity related<br>if you've been in a company where this<br>works well then you move to another<br>company you might bring the best<br>practices with you we have less of that<br>because we have fewer big companies here<br>and a lot of small and median<br>Enterprises but I also think the New<br>Zealand culture of number eight fencing<br>wire being independent doing things<br>yourself which is great in many ways<br>doesn't lead to being very collaborative<br>I would advise companies to start small<br>if they want to look into collaboration<br>so don't think we're going to suddenly<br>reform everything but find that lwh<br>hanging fruit find where is are some of<br>these inefficiency where are we losing<br>money so instead of just grumbling about<br>our customers not ordering what we want<br>or grumbling about our suppliers not<br>doing what we want them to be doing<br>let's try and figure out why because<br>usually it's because the incentives<br>aren't aligned right so what's in the<br>best interest of the supplier is not<br>what we want them to be doing simply<br>because of the way we've set up up our<br>contracts and incentives so not just<br>Grumble at them figure out you know how<br>can we actually solve their problem and<br>get them to be doing what we which is<br>better for us I think New Zealand<br>companies need to put a lot more<br>emphasis on their supply chain I think a<br>lot of the discussion in New Zealand is<br>about smart ideas and better new<br>products and not how do we actually set<br>our processes to make these things<br>efficiently and effectively and actually<br>be uh thoughtful about how we set up our<br>supply chain if we if we take one of our<br>very good companies Fisher and pyal<br>Healthcare I think it's a marvelous<br>company uh it's got hugely growing<br>revenues but they didn't actually have a<br>supply chain separate division until<br>only about five or so years ago uh so if<br>a company is as mature as that can not<br>realize how necessary it is to have a<br>supply chain Department what are our<br>small and median companies doing I think<br>most of the time they're just thinking<br>it will take care of itself it's really<br>any strategic choices to be made we just<br>want to keep costs down and not actually<br>realizing that there is money being left<br>on the table by not thinking<br>chains</p></main><footer
