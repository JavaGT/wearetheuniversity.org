Babies born small are at an increased risk of serious health complications - including death - but there are currently no treatments to improve a baby’s growth during pregnancy. In this presentation Dr Oyston explains how Viagra could be used to improve fetal growth and the next steps for this ground-breaking study.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

supervision of<br>Professor Philip Baker Charlotte studied<br>medicine at the University of atago<br>graduating with the beds honors in 2003<br>and mbchb in<br>2005 Charlotte then undertook training<br>In Obstetrics and Gynecology developing<br>a particular interest in how placental<br>pathology mediates fetal growth and<br>outcomes she interrupted her medical<br>training to join the ligins institute<br>for her doctoral studies Charlotte will<br>tell us about her exciting Research into<br>a potential novel therapy for the<br>treatment of fetal grth restriction<br>great thanks Frank and good evening<br>everybody so one of my areas of research<br>interest is fatal growth restriction and<br>this is where during pregnancy the baby<br>doesn't grow to its full genetic<br>potential this is a really important<br>complication because these babies are<br>much more vulnerable to serious<br>complications around the time time of<br>their delivery including breathing<br>difficulties brain injury and even<br>death but we also know that the<br>consequences of being born small don't<br>end in the neonatal period And as these<br>children grow up they're more likely to<br>become obese diabetic and have high<br>blood<br>pressure despite all of these<br>implications we currently have no<br>treatments that we can offer a woman in<br>pregnancy to improve her baby's growth<br>and this also means that the most<br>severely affected pregnancies are going<br>to have to be delivered pre term in<br>order to prevent still birth this is not<br>a satisfactory solution because then we<br>have the consequences of prematurity<br>restriction one important cause of<br>growth restriction is reduce placental<br>profusion and we know that in many of<br>these pregnancies the mother's blood<br>vessels that supply the placenta don't<br>undergo the same changes that they do in<br>a normal pregnancy so in a normal<br>healthy pregnancy the mother's blood<br>vessels become physically larger and<br>they dilate more and this means that<br>large amounts of blood are able to flow<br>through and profuse the placenta but in<br>many growth restricted pregnancies the<br>blood vessels stay narrow and<br>constricted and this means that less<br>blood is able to flow in peruse the<br>placenta so it's these sorts of<br>differences which have led to the<br>suggestion that substances that can<br>dilate the uterine circulation may be<br>good treatments for growth restriction<br>and sophy citrate more commonly known as<br>Viagra as one such possible candidate so<br>cenil is a potent vasod dator and we all<br>know that it in can increase the pelvic<br>blood flow in males but we hypothesize<br>that when used by pregnant women it will<br>also increase the percental blood flow<br>and result in increased fetal<br>growth there is now accumulating<br>evidence that cenil can improve fetal<br>growth but much of the work done to date<br>has been done in mice and rats and there<br>are two main gaps in our knowledge at<br>the<br>moment firstly evidence of sophy's<br>efficacy at improving growth in large<br>animals is lacking and in this case it's<br>really important to consider the large<br>animals because mice and rats have very<br>short pregnancies whereas large animals<br>tend to have pregnancies more similar in<br>length to humans and if s denifer works<br>and this is a treatment that we want to<br>be able to offer women over a number of<br>weeks so we need to be able to study it<br>over this time frame to ensure that it's<br>continued to B continue to be beneficial<br>and there is an absence of<br>harm we also don't have a clear<br>understanding of the mechanisms through<br>which sopy may improve fetal growth<br>although we hypothesize that because<br>it's a dilator it's going to dilate the<br>uterine arteries and increase blood flow<br>having a clear understanding of the<br>mechanism through which a treatment<br>works is really important because this<br>is what's going to help us to apply or<br>use the treatment most effectively in<br>the clinical<br>situation so over the next few minutes<br>I'm going to take you through three of<br>my studies where we're trying to answer<br>some of these<br>questions first of all we did a large<br>study in mice and the purpose of this<br>study was to assess the effects of<br>selenophile not only on fetal growth but<br>on the dilation in the mother's uterine<br>arteries we use three strains of mice<br>the c-57 they are our control strain so<br>in the absence of any other intervention<br>these mice have pregnancies which grow<br>normally then we use two strains the<br>Enos and the comp which have growth<br>restricted<br>babies in addition we wanted to do<br>something to make sure that the<br>pregnancies that we were studying were<br>as growth restricted as possible to do<br>this we put half of the mothers in each<br>strain on a high fat diet before and<br>during pregnancy because this is<br>something that's known to be detrimental<br>to fetal<br>growth then just over halfway through<br>the pregnancy we put mothers half of the<br>mothers in each group on a sopi<br>treatment this was given bya the<br>drinking water and the other half just<br>remained on the standard drinking water<br>so this treatment last lasted for 6 days<br>and at the end of it we took<br>measurements of the pups and assess the<br>mother's uterine artery<br>function so what did we see well as<br>expected the most severely growth<br>restricted pups in this study were from<br>the mothers who were on a high fat diet<br>so this is the weights of their pups<br>displayed in this graph here when the<br>mothers were treated with sodin there<br>was a significant increase in the<br>weights of their pups and we also saw a<br>significant increase in the length of<br>these pups and their girth when we<br>looked at the mother's uterine arteries<br>we assessed the way that these arteries<br>responded to both constricting agents<br>and D dilating agents and what we<br>expected to see is when the mothers had<br>been treated with sopur that the<br>construction curve would move to the<br>right or the dilation curve would move<br>to the left but in fact there was no<br>difference and what this suggested to us<br>was that the increase in growth that we<br>had observed was happening independently<br>of changes in the mother's uterine<br>artery<br>dilation so in our next study we took<br>quite a different approach and here we<br>use pregnant sheep in the first group we<br>embolized the uterine arteries of these<br>sheep while they were pregnant to induce<br>growth restriction in the lamb and what<br>this involves is injecting tiny micros<br>microscopic beads into the uterine<br>bloodstream these travel Downstream and<br>block the small blood vessels that<br>supply the placenta and cause placental<br>damage after this process was complete<br>we randomize half the Sheep to treatment<br>with sop infusion for three weeks and<br>the other half of the group were treated<br>with a water infusion vehicle infusion<br>in the third group we didn't do any<br>imization we didn't give any treatment<br>we just left these to grow normally so<br>controls here the embolization as<br>expected caused a dramatic reduction in<br>the lamb weight and the placental weight<br>in these<br>pregnancies when the youth had been<br>treated with s denil there was a small<br>but positive effect on the Lamb's weight<br>and this was in a region of 200 gram and<br>we saw a larger positive effect on the<br>placental<br>weight we looked at the uterine arteries<br>as we did uh for the mice and again no<br>difference in the way that these<br>arteries either constricted or<br>dilated where we did see differences<br>were changes in the blood FL flow from<br>the lamb to the placenta so just as in<br>human pregnancy we were able to do<br>ultrasound measurements of blood flow in<br>these in these shape and we measured the<br>umbilical cord blood flow<br>what this tells us about is resistance<br>to blood flow through the placenta and<br>in normal healthy pregnancy in both you<br>and and women we see a reduction of<br>resistance to blood flow as the<br>pregnancy advances this is exactly what<br>we saw in our control group however when<br>there is placental disease such as in<br>the case of fetal growth restriction as<br>a pregnancy progresses we get a plateau<br>and an increase in resistance to flow<br>and this is what we saw in our embolized<br>group however if the mothers had been<br>treated with cenil there was a fallen<br>resistance intermediate to the other two<br>groups and this suggested that sopy was<br>somehow reducing percental resistance so<br>in combination with the mice work both<br>our Studies have shown an increase in<br>fetal growth of s denil but in both<br>cases the changes have not been due to<br>changes in a Mother's uterine artery<br>dilation instead our work suggests that<br>perhaps cenil causes changes in<br>placental growth or even placental<br>structure so finally what about in<br>humans well the first ever randomized<br>study of cenil as a treatment for growth<br>restriction in human pregnancy started<br>right here in Oakland and this is a stri<br>of New Zealand Australia study which is<br>led by Dr Katie groom who is a Maternal<br>fedal Medicine specialist at oan<br>hospital this study randomizes women<br>with the most severely growth restricted<br>pregnancies to sudo or Placebo and for<br>the women who are delivering at Oakland<br>hospital we collecting a uterine biopsy<br>if they have a cesarian section and a<br>placental biopsy and what we're doing is<br>studying the same blood vessels that<br>we've studied in the mice and the Sheep<br>to see if these same changes are present<br>so the study is fully blinded and<br>recruitment is St under way so I don't<br>have any data to show you on this<br>tonight but recruitment is due to finish<br>early next year so it's very exciting<br>time for us and hopefully this time next<br>year we'll have something very<br>interesting to<br>show so just to wrap up the different<br>animal Studies have their different<br>strengths and we've been able to harness<br>these strengths and use them in con<br>conjunction with research done in human<br>subjects to investigate a potential new<br>therapy for fetal growth restriction our<br>work certainly supports Soder as a<br>treatment for growth restriction but<br>suggests that the changes in growth are<br>not due to uterine artery dation but may<br>be mediated By changes in placental<br>growth the studies confirming these<br>findings in human pregnancy are ongoing<br>as uh further studies of placentas<br>collected from both the mice and the<br>sheep and the studies I've talked about<br>to really try and tease out what is<br>going on in these tissues to cause these<br>changes in fetal<br>growth and I'd finally like to finish by<br>acknowledging all the support this these<br>projects have received the supervisory<br>report um support from Philip Baker<br>Frank Bloomfield Katie groom and Joanna<br>Stanley and to acknowledge the different<br>funding bodies in particular the mercy<br>BS Trust revor
