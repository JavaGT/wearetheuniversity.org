student<br>studying under the supervision of<br>Professor David Cameron Smith shika<br>studied for her Bachelor of Science and<br>masters of biochemistry in India before<br>immigrating to New Zealand Sheik was<br>exploring the mysteries of human breast<br>milk she is investigating the impact of<br>different environmental social and<br>biological factors on stress hormones in<br>human milk and you may have seen her<br>research featured in the New Zealand<br>Herald this morning in this fascinating<br>presentation she will explain how<br>maternal factors can influence the<br>composition of milk and discuss whether<br>they can affect the health of breastfed<br>babies care thanks Frank and thanks<br>everyone for coming here and taking time<br>out of such a busy schedule so uh as<br>Frank mentioned my PhD is about human<br>milk and its<br>composition<br>for human babies mother's milk is<br>everything it's like a perfect cocktail<br>of nutrient essential for their growth<br>and<br>development mother's milk has this<br>remarkable property of changing its<br>composition at every stage of lactation<br>it can change its composition if a child<br>is boy or girl it can change its<br>composition if a mother is underweight<br>or overweight it can even change its<br>composition<br>if a child is born fullterm or pre-term<br>in short it's a food exclusively made<br>for your child and that's why majority<br>of health professionals consider it so<br>much more than just food it is an<br>intense process where mother sends<br>biochemical signals to her<br>child in addition to providing all those<br>essential nutrient human milk contain<br>lots of non-nutritive bioactive<br>compounds such as digestive enzymes<br>antimicrobial compounds hormones and<br>growth factors which are essential for<br>their survival and healthy<br>development by saying that having a<br>child and raising a child is exciting<br>but challenging<br>too and I'm sure most of you will agree<br>with me when mother is stressed she can<br>possibly transfer those stress hormones<br>to her child via<br>milk and because these little baby<br>system are still developing these<br>secondhand hormones or you could say<br>these additional hormones can affect<br>their behavior and temperament<br>differently and all these effects can<br>have different consequences for both<br>girls because stress has feature Modern<br>Life or it's kind of an integral part of<br>our Modern Life we wanted to know what<br>this Modern Life is doing to the<br>composition of milk so why are we<br>interested in stress<br>hormones first of all stress hormones<br>are mainly consist of cortisol the<br>active hormone cortisone the inactive<br>hormone apart from regulating the stress<br>they play an important role for the<br>human development such as fetal<br>maturation brain development immune<br>response and are also required for<br>normal<br>metabolism but some recent Studies have<br>shown that stress hormones ingested via<br>mother's milk can affect child's<br>differently and these can have different<br>impact on boys and<br>girls<br>traditionally scientists have correlated<br>maternal mood state with the stress<br>level in her blood but very little is<br>known about the impact of maternal<br>environmental factors on the stress<br>level in mother's milk and that's where<br>my PhD comes in so the main objective of<br>my research was to identify maternal<br>social environmental and and biological<br>factors and identify their effect on the<br>stress hormone level in their milk I<br>have studied lot of Social and<br>biological factors but today I'll only<br>discuss about the most interesting one<br>such as mode of infant delivery<br>breastfeeding patterns family structure<br>marital status or parental<br>relationship and seasonal variation<br>which would account for environmental<br>factors and to do that we collaborated<br>with one of the university in Finland<br>and obtained more than 800 breast mil<br>samples and getting more than 800 breast<br>milk samples is a really big<br>deal and all those samples were<br>collected when infants were 3 months<br>old so far this is the first study which<br>have investigated the impact of mode of<br>infant delivery on mother's stress<br>hormone level in her milk<br>and as you can see here the xais shows<br>the stress hormone level in mother's<br>milk and the Y AIS shows the groups we<br>compared so the white bar indicates the<br>normal delivery like where mother<br>delivered babies by a normal natural<br>process of birth whereas the black bar<br>indicates the cesarian deliveries where<br>mother had their babies where cesarian<br>section or surgical procedure to deliver<br>the babies and the results of my Studies<br>have shown the significant increase in<br>the milk of mothers who had cesarian<br>babies compared to the ones who had<br>normal<br>deliveries even 3 months after the birth<br>of their child something important to<br>think<br>about then we looked at another<br>important factors and that is<br>breastfeeding according to World Health<br>Organization<br>breastfeeding is usually categorized<br>into two main types exclusive<br>breastfeeding and partial breastfeeding<br>in exclusive breastfeeding infant<br>receive mother's milk except the<br>medication for the first few months of<br>their<br>life and in the partial breastfeeding<br>they get the combination of both breast<br>milk and formula milk again in these<br>graphs as you as you can see the xais<br>indicates the stress hormone level in<br>the mother's milk whereas this Y Bar AIS<br>shows the comparison between the group<br>so the white bar indicates the exclusive<br>Le breastfed kids whereas the black bar<br>indicates the partial breast fed groups<br>and contrary to our<br>expectations we found that breastfeeding<br>preferences or patterns have no impact<br>on the stress hormone level of mother's<br>milk<br>but it wasn't the case when we looked at<br>the social support structure of mothers<br>out of all the social factors we found<br>that parental relationship or marital<br>status or family structure are the most<br>interesting<br>one in this marital status one we<br>divided our mothers based on their<br>marital status the white bar here here<br>indicates the mothers who were married<br>and this gray bar indicates the mother<br>who were in the relationship either they<br>were living together or def facto<br>relationship and the black indicates<br>mothers who were<br>single and results of my Studies have<br>shown that mothers who were single their<br>milk had significantly high level of<br>stress hormones in their milk compared<br>to the one who were living with the<br>husbands or Partners we further looked<br>at the Imp impact of family structure or<br>family<br>Arrangement here we divided mothers or<br>their milk samples in three groups again<br>first was the nuclear the white bar<br>indicates the nuclear family which has<br>same biological parents whereas the gray<br>bar indicates the Blended one and it has<br>one of the parent Wass a step parent<br>whereas the black bar indicates solo<br>parent where mother was on her own and<br>and similar to parental relationship we<br>found the<br>mothers who were single or who were<br>living on their own their milk levels<br>had significantly high level of stress<br>hormone compared to the ones who had<br>been some who had some kind of support<br>so basically these results<br>indicate importance of dads or maybe a<br>big boohoo for dad that you are doing<br>something even if your wies are saying<br>something then we looked at the seasonal<br>variation and in here we divided our<br>mothers or maybe we divided our milk<br>samples when they were collected so the<br>black bar indicates the samples which<br>were collected in the uh winter season<br>whereas the white bar indicates the when<br>the milk samples were collected around<br>the summer season so again the results<br>showed<br>that milk samples however we were quite<br>surprised to see these results that the<br>milk samples which were collected during<br>summer season they had significantly<br>high level of stress hormones compared<br>to the ones we collected in<br>Winters why we we also wondered why and<br>it was my own assumption that maybe<br>mothers were busy organizing more<br>picnics and it's quite<br>stressful so what's the key message of<br>my research the key message of my<br>research is that maternal environmental<br>factors can have a significant impact on<br>the milk composition particularly mode<br>of delivery seasonality and support<br>system can affect the stress hormone<br>level of Mother's Milk press milk is a<br>remarkably complex fluid and because it<br>is so ubiquitous in our environment we<br>often tend to take it for<br>granted there are several unanswered<br>questions from my research which needs<br>to be answered and the first and most<br>important is that what are the effect of<br>altered milk<br>composition on the early life<br>development and if there are any<br>long-term consequences to it all these<br>questions need to be answered and they<br>can only be answered with the support<br>from science and society and that's<br>where you all come<br>in I want as a researcher I want to<br>bring results out of the lab to the<br>normal people policy maker and all the<br>health professional and inform normal<br>New Zealander how to make a better start<br>life and in the end I would like to<br>acknowledge my lab group especially my<br>supervisor David camon Smith and most<br>importantly all the philanthropic<br>fundings gravida egg research and riddit<br>Institute for giving me or for funding<br>my research and giving me this<br>opportunity to explore the mysteries of<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
