who<br>will be well known to many of you<br>Professor Harding was a founding member<br>of the liens Institute and until<br>recently was Deputy Vice Chancellor<br>research at the University of ockland<br>Jane has a phenomenal track record as<br>researcher inter perinatal Health<br>recognized through numerous Awards and<br>honors including fellow of the roal<br>Society of New Zealand officer

talk to us about how<br>her Research into a simple therapy for<br>low blood sugar levels in newborn babies<br>is changing clinical practice around the<br>world thank you K thank you Frank and<br>good<br>evening my task this evening is to take<br>you from research to reality and that's<br>quite a tall order because that process<br>is usually a long one and I think we<br>should not shy away from the fact that<br>much of the research that we do will<br>produce changes in reality if you like<br>in clinical practice but it might take a<br>long time to do do so and this is only<br>the 15th anniversary of the liens<br>Institute<br>nevertheless what I'm hoping to do for<br>the next few minutes is to tell you<br>three short<br>stories of examples of research that has<br>had an effect on our clinical practice<br>over that time period and a little<br>longer in some<br>cases so I started by thinking what<br>research will we do<br>when the Institute was<br>founded and at that time I was working<br>and a number of my colleagues some of<br>whom are in the room were working on<br>what regulates growth of the baby before<br>birth and we were working in<br>sheep and in sheep it is really quite<br>easy to show that what regulates growth<br>of the baby before birth is<br>nutrition and this is a fetal lamb in<br>the mother's womb growing along from day<br>to day each spot is a measurement by day<br>and here we start a period of maternal<br>relative under nutrition and the baby<br>simply stops<br>growing and we refeed the mother and the<br>baby starts growing again it is very<br>obvious in sheep that this is an<br>important regulator of fetal<br>growth but of course they're sheep and<br>they don't quite all do the same thing<br>it's very frustrating if you're<br>researcher because mostly Lambs were<br>growing along and slowing down and<br>starting up again but some of them just<br>kept growing when we undernourished the<br>mother and it took me longer than I<br>would like to admit to work out that the<br>difference is actually back here before<br>the<br>undernutrition and you can see that<br>fetuses that were growing rapidly slowed<br>down and fetuses that were already<br>growing slowly had made some kind of<br>adaptation and were able to keep going<br>and we thought that's very interesting<br>what is it that's determined that these<br>fetuses are already growing<br>slowly so we postulated that this was<br>about events that had happened very<br>early in<br>pregnancy and we designed this<br>experiment where sheep were either<br>wellfed or were undernourished from<br>before this is 60 days before until 30<br>days after<br>mating so in my head this was something<br>like a mother who's not eating well<br>who's relatively undernourished before<br>pregnancy and in the first month of<br>pregnancy until she knows she's<br>pregnant now she starts eating well for<br>the rest of<br>pregnancy and what we found in those<br>animals was that in fact everything was<br>changed about their babies their fetuses<br>from that period of under nutrition that<br>finished one month into a 5mon pregnancy<br>so you can see that these Lambs grew<br>slowly not much different but they<br>definitely were growing slowly right out<br>to term even though mother had been well<br>nourished for the last four<br>months we had altered the way that<br>insulin was secreted in response to a<br>stimulus in the fetus before birth and<br>it takes a few years to find out but in<br>fact that insulin secretion was impaired<br>in the adults when they grew up so that<br>period of undernutrition around the time<br>of conception changed the way insulin<br>was secreted in their adult<br>Offspring this was a permanent<br>change and to our<br>surprise the ones that had been<br>undernourished delivered early so sheep<br>all deliver at about the same time here<br>but this is the ones who'd been<br>undernourished right at the beginning of<br>pregnancy and they delivered early<br>you'll notice the author of this paper<br>tonight we were very surprised about<br>that because of course all of the focus<br>on the causes of pre-m birth is about<br>what's happening in<br>pregnancy and this study suggested that<br>what was going on about pre-term birth<br>had actually started before<br>pregnancy and that the key key was right<br>at the beginning of pregnancy of course<br>when we published that nobody believed<br>us and everybody said it well it's sheep<br>you know but in<br>fact there have been a number of<br>subsequent studies showing very similar<br>findings in humans here is a<br>relationship for example between<br>maternal size at the beginning of<br>pregnancy these are thin women down here<br>baby and here is a variety of odds<br>ratios so risk if you like of women<br>whose babies are already small right at<br>the beginning of the pregnancy who are<br>already small at the time of the first<br>Scan they are twice as likely to have an<br>early delivery or to have a small baby<br>as those that are growing<br>well<br>now you're all familiar with the idea of<br>the first thousand days it's sort of all<br>over the place you can find a thousand<br>different pictures of it on the<br>internet the first of those th000 days<br>is the period before<br>conception and the reason we've focused<br>right from the beginning of before<br>conception in part is due to those<br>studies that we did that said actually<br>the time around the time of conception<br>is critical for the whole of the rest of<br>the pregnancy and for the lifelong<br>Offspring so that's one little story the<br>second I have to tell you about antinal<br>steroids because we are talking about<br>the liin Institute and anti steroids<br>really are the legacy of montt's early<br>work and I was very privileged to work<br>with Peter gakman the founding director<br>of The leins Institute and with the<br>immense support of Mont who taught me<br>when I was a medical student and was a<br>tremendous supporter ever since and of<br>course he did do his sheep studies at<br>Nash women's and he did keep his sheep<br>in Cornwell<br>Park and he was doing in the late 60s<br>some very important work on what is it<br>that determines the timing of birth and<br>he did some very elegant work showing<br>that it was steroid cortisol levels in<br>the<br>fetus that regulated the timing of the<br>onset of<br>Labor and he showed in the course of<br>those experiments rather by accident<br>that if he gave steroids not only did<br>the U go into labor and get pre term<br>delivery but the Lambs<br>survived in all preterm Lambs died<br>because they got lung<br>disease and this is the report in<br>1969 that there was partial irration of<br>the lungs suggesting that this might be<br>accelerated maturation of the lungs and<br>of course pre-term babies died of lung<br>disease they got this terrible<br>respiratory disease this little baby<br>sucking in its chest because the lungs<br>are so<br>stiff and he went on with Ross Hoy to do<br>the this iconic study reported in<br>1972 that giving steroids to mothers<br>before pre-term birth saved the lives of<br>their babies there was dramatic changes<br>huge changes at a time when many<br>pre-term babies died of lung<br>disease that wasn't of course the end of<br>the<br>story 2006 21 studies later how many<br>times do we have to check that it still<br>works we still know<br>that the risk of death in babies exposed<br>to steroids for example versus those not<br>exposed was reduced to<br>77% respiratory distress cerebal pausy<br>developmental delay half as likely to be<br>developmentally delayed if the baby got<br>steroids and in fact 20 years after the<br>original publication the NIH the big<br>powerful North American organization was<br>trying to remind people that actually<br>this was a rare example of something<br>that not only worked but it saved<br>money why 20 years later were we still<br>trying to persuade people this was a<br>good idea well in part because we all<br>know steroids are bad for<br>you there were lots of reasons why this<br>treatment wasn't widely taken up for so<br>long but one of them was that people<br>continued to worry about whether there<br>would be any long-term adverse effects<br>of exposing pre-term babies to this very<br>powerful drug before<br>birth and we realized that we really had<br>to answer that<br>question so I got to stand around in the<br>middle and smile at everybody<br>but Mont liins and Ross Hoy the original<br>authors very kindly allowed us to use<br>their original data and Stuart dzil who<br>was a PhD student did all the work as<br>the way things<br>work because when I came back to New<br>Zealand<br>to take up a job at Nash women's I was<br>allocated the office that had been Ross<br>Ho's and in the cupboard were the<br>original records of the original trial<br>so we set about to find<br>out if the survivors of that original<br>trial had any effects in the long term<br>from their exposure to<br>glucocorticoids we had the handwritten<br>records we knew the name of the mother<br>and the date of birth and sex of the<br>baby but nothing<br>else and finding 30 year olds when you<br>don't know their name is a bit of a<br>challenge but we did CU New Zealand's a<br>small place but of course 30y old new<br>zealanders aren't just in New Zealand<br>they're all over the<br>world but they very generously came to<br>take part in our study and the short<br>answer of a lot of work was that 30<br>years<br>later exposure to antinal steroids had<br>no effect on any of these<br>things and nor did it have any effect on<br>any of these things and we were able to<br>fairly confidently tell the world that<br>actually this is a very safe as well as<br>effective treatment and people might get<br>on with using<br>it that was a very important<br>study to help as swge some concerns but<br>of course Mont always had his eye on the<br>next problem he was very good at paper<br>darts too and he published right back<br>after the first<br>trial that the treatment seemed to work<br>best in the first week after it was<br>given so if you had a woman who appeared<br>to be about to deliver pre-term and you<br>gave steroids but she didn't<br>deliver in that next week should you<br>then give another<br>dose and about the time this was<br>becoming a Hot Topic because people<br>started using steroids so of course more<br>is better they started using lots of<br>steroids there were studies coming out<br>in sheep suggesting there was a dose<br>response so the more doses you got the<br>better the lungs were in The Offspring<br>but the smaller the lamb was because<br>steroids inhibit growth so was this a<br>good thing or a bad<br>thing very important to do proper trials<br>and find out and Professor Caroline<br>Crowther LED this study in which we<br>collaborated on both sides of the<br>tasmine where we looked at whether<br>repeat steroids was better than a single<br>course for preventing lung<br>disease and the short answer is that<br>they are the risk of respiratory disease<br>is reduced to 80% the risk of serious<br>outcomes is reduced but birth weight is<br>also<br>reduced 78 gram is not very much much<br>does it matter what should we be<br>recommending for practice well we<br>thought we needed to wait just a little<br>longer and see how these children were<br>when they grew up so we looked at them<br>when they were two and when they were<br>two they looked just<br>fine so we recommended that it was time<br>people were using this treatment but as<br>is often the case the medical profession<br>wasn't quite convinced and people were<br>still worried about whether there might<br>be long-term effects so we looked at<br>them again when they were seven how long<br>do you want to wait and at 7 again the<br>study led by Professor CRA just<br>published nearly a thousand children no<br>difference in any of these things so<br>they got early benefit with no late<br>effects and Dr Chris McKinley who's<br>recently joined the liin as a senior<br>lecturer but was a PhD student doing<br>this study showed that when we studied<br>the New Zealand children in great detail<br>they not only functioned fine but all of<br>their hormones and all of their body<br>fine so Caroline has gone on to lead the<br>production in Australia and New Zealand<br>of the bational clinical guidelines so<br>here is the definitive published this is<br>what we need to do folks in the hope<br>that we can in fact bring reality to<br>and the third very brief story I will<br>tell you because it's a shorter one is<br>about neonatal hypoglycemia this is some<br>of our current<br>research low blood glucose levels in<br>babies are common it is the commonest<br>metabolic problem of newborn babies it's<br>perhaps the only common preventable<br>cause of brain damage if glucose levels<br>are low enough for long enough that<br>causes brain damage because glucose is<br>the major fuel for the brain and of<br>brains so what do we do because babies<br>don't tell us when they have low blood<br>sugar levels we test their blood sugar<br>levels and we test the babies who we<br>think are at risk which is big babies<br>and small babies and infants of<br>diabetics and sick babies and in fact<br>nearly a third of all babies turn out to<br>be at risk so we do lots of blood tests<br>but we don't really know for each<br>individual baby how low is too low for<br>this baby and and we don't really have a<br>really good treatment for them even if<br>we find a low sugar so we end up<br>admitting them to intensive care to have<br>a drip to get their blood sugars up take<br>them away from their parents and inhibit<br>breastfeeding so we thought there ought<br>to be a better way of doing this and<br>Deborah Harris who's another PhD student<br>who's a nurse practitioner in Hamilton<br>did this project where we did a<br>randomized trial to determine whether a<br>dextrose gel a sugar gel was more<br>effective than Placebo and reversing<br>hypoglycemia in the first 408 hours<br>after<br>birth and the short answer is It's very<br>effective so this is the rate of<br>treatment failure not getting the sugar<br>up with two doses of gel you can see it<br>decreases markedly if they get dexos gel<br>being admitted to intensive care for<br>treatment of their hypoglycemia markedly<br>reduced and to my great<br>Delight a marked decrease in Formula<br>feeding at 2 weeks of age<br>Our concern was that giving these babies<br>gel might inhibit breastfeeding what we<br>think it actually did was reinforce<br>breastfeeding by keeping babies out of<br>intensive care keeping them with their<br>mothers and reducing the stress of<br>concerns this is an unusual story this<br>is a research going to reality very<br>quickly that paper was published in<br>2013 it's now only 20 2016 here are four<br>published reports of other parts of the<br>world who've taken up the use of dextr<br>gel and they have all reported a fall in<br>the rate of admission for<br>hypoglycemia big changes keeping babies<br>out of intensive care within a very<br>short time of our doing that<br>research so we're now gone on to do<br>another big study which we're in the<br>midst of at the moment saying well if<br>dextr gel helps treat low sugar levels<br>could we use it to help prevent low<br>sugar levels and could if it did that<br>could we keep babies out of intensive<br>care improve breastfeeding reduce costs<br>we're in the midst of that study at the<br>moment so I hope I've given you three<br>short stories about research to reality<br>in the liens Institute in its Short<br>history there will be lots more and<br>there's a lot of important research<br>still going on and of course I get to<br>talk about it but everybody else gets to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
