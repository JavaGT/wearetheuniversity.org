Fraser I'm the<br>dean of the faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences and it's my very great<br>pleasure to welcome you all here tonight<br>I know the weather is just awful outside<br>so uh it's wonderful to see such a a<br>great turnout uh so I'd like to welcome<br>you all to what is our first of our uh<br>series of inaugural lectures for<br>2016 uh and as I said before it's a real<br>Delight to see so many colleagues and<br>friends and family here tonight both<br>from within the university and from<br>outside the university and I believe a<br>number of you have traveled quite some<br>distance uh to attend<br>tonight so I'm just going to give you a<br>very brief overview of what inauguration<br>really means uh it's uh it's a process<br>that's been around for a very long time<br>with universities it serves two purposes<br>uh one is an expression of the<br>acknowledgement and welcome a reception<br>for new professors joining the circle of<br>Este colleagues that we refer to as the<br>propor the second and most important is<br>to showcase the subject area and the<br>story of the new professor their Maiden<br>lecture as a professor at the University<br>of ockland the lecture series is one of<br>the highlights of our academic calendar<br>and this year we have three new<br>professors uh that we'll be presenting<br>over the forthcoming weeks so academic<br>inauguration dates back to Medieval<br>Times it was unashamedly intended to<br>impress the public and the rich<br>benefactors the need for their uh<br>continued<br>patronage professors were chosen not<br>only for for their intellectual capacity<br>but also their financial<br>worthiness one tradition required the<br>new fellow to host all the colleagues<br>for the duration of the inauguration<br>period uh I believe that was the start<br>of academic<br>fees so today's inaugural lecture are a<br>means of introducing our most eminent<br>staff elevation to the rank of Professor<br>is not something we take very<br>lightly since for many it represents the<br>Pinnacle of one's academic career the<br>process for selection is long and<br>involves and requires intense scrutiny<br>by other professors are then also<br>advised by a body of international peers<br>who must confirm that the uh appointee<br>is indeed considered internationally<br>eminent in their chosen<br>field I believe inaugural lectures are a<br>wonderful opportunity for colleagues<br>family and friends to learn about the<br>journey that has led to this an academic<br>success the Milestones the decisions and<br>particularly the mentors who have<br>assisted and steered along the way<br>tonight is my very great pleasure to<br>introduce Professor Ian<br>Bisset Ian is currently the head of the<br>department of surgery and a consultant<br>coloral surgeon at Oakland City hospital<br>and is also the past president of the<br>coloral surgical Society of Australia<br>and New<br>Zealand so without further Ado it is my<br>great pleasure uh to invite Professor<br>Brian Perry<br>former head of the department of surgery<br>to formally introduce Professor Bisset<br>Professor Parry will invite Ian to<br>deliver his inaugural lecture after<br>which Professor Alan Mary the head of<br>the school of medicine will deliver some<br>Brian kioto and I use that informal<br>greeting advisedly because although this<br>is a prestigious lecture uh it's also a<br>family and friends occasion so I think<br>that's very appropriate it's my great<br>privilege to introduce Ian I need to<br>come clean and express my my interest<br>and that he's a a much respected<br>colleague of mine we work together day<br>by day and more than that he's a deep uh<br>friend as well Ian was born and raised<br>in the city of Oakland he attended<br>Oakland grammar school and some of you<br>may have heard of that it's a little<br>school school just up the road there um<br>he threed away a lot of his time there<br>he played rugby for the first 15 and<br>indeed in 1972 he was Captain of their<br>first<br>15 also he was a senior Athletics champ<br>that year as well and head prefect to<br>boot um he managed to do a little bit of<br>homework cuz he got a a university<br>entrance scholarship and also an ASB<br>scholarship the same year so it was<br>quite a quite a year in<br>he studied medicine in this faculty here<br>and was awarded the mbchb in<br>1978 he did house surgeon years in<br>taranaki uh he was a surgical registar<br>there for another couple of years in<br>basic training and then got into the<br>Advanced Training scheme in Wellington<br>where he was granted the uh FCS in<br>1987 for the next decade he worked as a<br>consultant general surgeon in the<br>Western Regional Hospital in po Nepal<br>and that is an interesting institution<br>that is a Synergy between a missionary<br>society and the government and<br>missionary doctors learn a great deal in<br>those situations they learn a lot about<br>need they learn a lot about<br>Innovation uh working things out from<br>first principles and the uh Importance<br>of Being Frugal and smart with the spend<br>because there ain't a lot of money so in<br>a way it's sounds like being part of the<br>or on return to New Zealand he was<br>appointed as a lecturer in surgery and<br>research fellow in the department of<br>surgery and he got his MD awarded in<br>2001 then he did Fellowship training and<br>professional training in coloral surgery<br>both at Oakland and Concord in<br>Sydney came back senior lecturer and<br>consultant color surgeon and then he<br>became head of the coloral unit in<br>2007 uh until<br>2012 he was a promoted to associate<br>professor in 2008 not easy and then in<br>2011 in a weak moment he he uh accepted<br>the idea of being head of Department of<br>the<br>University department of<br>surgery um I don't want to go on too<br>long because we want to hear this from<br>this man but he has he's done a awful<br>lot he's a member of the roal austral<br>Asia College of Surgeons he's um an<br>honorary life member of the surgical<br>Society of<br>Nepal the coloral surgical Society<br>coloral surgical Society of Australia<br>New Zealand he was president of from<br>2012 to 2014 he's in various other<br>sections do coloral surgery and academic<br>surgery and college and so on and<br>amongst other things um he's chair of<br>the national B ccer working group uh in<br>New Zealand and on various advisory<br>groups too numerous to<br>mention uh this man has tuned out a lot<br>of um peer-reviewed papers over the<br>years he's got PhD students uh for<br>Africa um many of who are attending<br>tonight they should be actually studying<br>but they're here apparently because I<br>know you'll be looking for them um so<br>trying to draw the strands together<br>folks uh Ian for me stands out as a man<br>of high integrity he's an energetic and<br>hardworking person very generous to his<br>patients to his colleagues and his<br>students he's academically bright and<br>very productive and on top of all that I<br>think what stands out as his<br>leadership a novelist who I'm sure<br>you've never read called David Wallace<br>once said real leaders are people who<br>help us overcome the limitations of our<br>own individual laziness and selfishness<br>and weakness and fear and get us to do<br>better harder things than we could get<br>ourselves to do on our own perfectly sum<br>summarizes Ian in his approach and also<br>the observation made by Tom Peters<br>leaders don't make followers they make<br>leaders and that's what Ian is doing in<br>his career and I think it's a<br>tremendous uh thing that you've been<br>appointed as professor in this August<br>faculty in University<br>I now invite you Ian to come forward and<br>lecture<br>professor<br>joher professor Ellen M Professor Brian<br>Perry my very good friend very generous<br>friend thank you my colleagues friends<br>and family it's an amazing privilege to<br>be here with you today and one that<br>seems somewhat unreal i' have to say I<br>need to apologize to those of you who<br>thought the lecture about the St and the<br>unmentionable was going to be a<br>America it's actually going to be<br>something of a personal journey in colal<br>surgery that I've had and it's all been<br>focused around patients whom I have come<br>into contact with and I realized that<br>the treatment that they've had is really<br>not as optimal as it ought to be and<br>that has driven me into looking at way<br>there different ways of managing<br>conditions that might actually make the<br>better this institution is my Elma M I<br>spent six heavy years here as a medical<br>student I entered the medical school<br>thinking I would become a general<br>practitioner working in a rural<br>community close to the Sea where I could<br>go fishing and where I could get plenty<br>of chance to [ __ ] in this beautiful<br>country that<br>in during my 60 years however two very<br>important things happened I met my wife<br>Jo my wonderful wife who I married in<br>the fifth year and I was completely<br>challenged by the in inequalities in<br>care for patients across the world the<br>global<br>inequalities really stood out and along<br>with that the privilege that I had as a<br>person living in New Zealand<br>and so I was challenged really to think<br>of spending my life in a way that might<br>there in my sixth Year Joe and I went to<br>neple for my elective and you can blame<br>blame the<br>elective uh program for a lot of what<br>happened we spent 3 months in a small<br>Mission Hospital in armed people working<br>with an inspirational surgeon from<br>America called Tom Hal we were<br>absolutely amazed at the beautiful views<br>of the mountains and the hills there and<br>also the plight of the people who were<br>so poor and had so little<br>treatment I went to thinking I was going<br>to be a general practitioner and I came<br>out thinking the world needs another<br>surgeon and so for the next 8 years I<br>spent time in ter and then and training<br>to be a general<br>surgeon at the end of that time my<br>seniors said to me we've got a job for<br>you it's in Norwich it's a great place<br>to continue to<br>train I'm afraid I felt a pull in a<br>different<br>direction and it all revolves around the<br>word<br>vocation this is a word that isn't used<br>very often nowadays but my daughter<br>Miriam who a has a PHD in Classics tells<br>me it's a word that's used for an<br>occupation that involves service that<br>affects a<br>lifestyle and that's paid less than it's<br>worth she should know she's a<br>through what what sorry we are tell in<br>the world's needs cross there lies your<br>vocation and to be honest there were<br>some other words that struck me as well<br>they were the words of Jesus Christ when<br>he said whatever you did for one of the<br>least of these brothers and sisters of<br>mine you did for me so in<br>1987 with two daughters in toe we headed<br>to Neco at that stage the country had a<br>population of 17 million a life<br>expectancy 51 years and the government<br>we went with a um a Christian Mission<br>organization called the international<br>dep power fellowship and I was seconded<br>to a government Hospital the Western<br>Regional hospital it had 200 beards it<br>served a population of 3 million there<br>were 20 doctors on the staff almost all<br>of them neali and only 55 nures to<br>manage 200 beds day and night all year<br>the budget was only half a million US<br>dollars a<br>year it was a steep learning curve and<br>the challenges included learning a new<br>language trying to work without the<br>resources that I being used<br>to trying to understand what it was like<br>for a patient to have to buy their<br>medication and all of their<br>disposables and on top of that there's<br>an endless supply of patients presenting<br>I tried to adapt in as much as I could I<br>closed the open us fish line and then<br>published a paper on how to sterilize<br>things using a plastic bag and form and<br>tablets I kept patients warm under a<br>special tent which had a hair dryer at<br>the top and anything that could safely<br>be sterilized<br>was this brings me to the first part of<br>my talk patients who were starving and<br>there were two main cical patients like<br>this patients with gastric out<br>obstruction and patients with postoper<br>small b f and we look at both of these<br>Gest out instruction occurs from two<br>conditions in the<br>set the first is chronic Pula where the<br>scaring closes off the outlet of the<br>stomach and the second is gastri cancer<br>where the cancer does that patients<br>present with Co Ving incredible weight<br>loss disturbance to their um hydration<br>and<br>electrolytes and even as earli as 1936<br>it was known that these patients when<br>have lost L weight don't do well after<br>surgery with a high<br>mortality so I sit off initially looking<br>after these patients i' rehydrate them I<br>correct their electrolytes and I'd<br>operate on them it was one of two<br>operations I did I either removed the<br>lower half of the stomach as shown in<br>this picture or I did a bypass where I<br>brought some B up above where it was<br>obstructed and joined it together I<br>think I did a pretty good job but three<br>of the first 14 patients I operated on<br>died all of them because they had a<br>complication related to to their<br>malnutrition so I thought hard about<br>what we could do and I added something<br>to the<br>operation I added a tube that went into<br>the bow Downstream from where I joined<br>the stomach to the intestine and I<br>started feeding them immed imately after<br>surgery the first day they would get a<br>sugary solution and then from there on<br>by day two or three they were getting<br>all the calories that they needed here's<br>the<br>results I I looked after another 44<br>patients who had gu out their<br>destruction during my time in the<br>call they were the second group in terms<br>of age in terms of um pathology in terms<br>of operation were pretty well the same<br>the mortality dropped from over 20% to<br>just one patient and 44<br>2% that didn't mean they didn't get<br>complications however and most of these<br>complications would have killed patients<br>if I couldn't feed them at the same time<br>patients whose stomach didn't work and<br>so you couldn't feed them because it<br>wouldn't contract patients who leaked<br>from rejoined the valve together and so<br>we couldn't feed them through the<br>stomach and patients who were<br>vomitting with the Sho that I placed in<br>there I could continue to feed them<br>these me are very much underage and the<br>on so in<br>conclusion gastric Su during the<br>malnourished is actually has a very high<br>mortality but I've shown that we can<br>reduce that mortality by a relatively<br>simple procedure which would be done at<br>the time of surgery and that this would<br>also help to manage the postoper<br>complications the<br>second condition is even more<br>challenging these are patients with<br>small B fers in this situation we<br>operate on the patient join the small<br>intestine together and sometime later<br>that breaks down the intestinal content<br>SK gets into the abdominal cavity and<br>leaks out through the abdominal<br>wall the devastation of this condition<br>was brought home to me by a patient<br>called ruk minina who was 29 years old<br>when I saw him this was 198<br>9 UM she<br>arrived really very sick so sick with<br>peritonitis had a labotomy and I found<br>that she had a condition called<br>necrotising intis that's a bacterial<br>infection that causes patching the death<br>of the small bow so I removed all the<br>deits and joined the rest of it together<br>not surprisingly some of that fell<br>apart and this started leaking out onto<br>her abdal wall<br>in theol some one of your relatives has<br>to look after you while you're in<br>hospital she had brought her 12-year-old<br>for this gives you an idea of the extent<br>of the difficulty that we had I had none<br>of the normal um devices that we have in<br>New Zealand that would manage the wound<br>I had I had no intravenous feeding that<br>we would use in New Zealand which<br>contains all the nutrients that you<br>might need I had no intents of care<br>initially I tried to reoperate and close<br>these but inevitably it broke down and<br>the situation was worse than had been<br>before 3 months later after her son had<br>cared for her for all this time she<br>died I was<br>devastated her son was left almost as a<br>an orphan and some of my friends in New<br>Zealand helped support him he now<br>um marriage two children and an<br>accountant working in poker in 1990 I<br>came back to New Zealand and I talked<br>about this problem with gr Hill who was<br>a a world expert of this at that<br>stage the problems associated with with<br>small b f are<br>dramatic the patient becomes dehydrated<br>their electrolytes are all toot their<br>skin gets eroded by the autodigestion of<br>the enzyme from the the um fluid that<br>comes out they develop an intal in<br>infection and over time very quickly<br>become um<br>malnourished it's a really toxic mix and<br>in a situation like Neal almost everyone<br>who has a fish<br>dies Graham told me grah H told me about<br>a paper he had just read which had been<br>which had been published out of France<br>where they had done an amazing uh way of<br>managing these patients<br>using ental feeding that's feeding into<br>the intestine and if necessary refeeding<br>what had come out into the intestine<br>further<br>Downstream they had a series of 335<br>patients 85 of them were were managed by<br>interal feeding 92 of those patients had<br>to be refered in some way into the<br>distal B and their overall mortality was<br>34% even in<br>France<br>I did some thinking I thought maybe I<br>can use this technique and so I<br>developed what I call the triple St<br>technique now the triple stom technique<br>involves placing three different tubes<br>the first tube goes into the stomach now<br>you need to have a tube in the stomach<br>so that you can continuously feed these<br>patients I tried feeding them orally and<br>they wouldn't eat enough I tried putting<br>a tube down the nose to feed them and it<br>only last one or two days and they took<br>it out and wouldn't let you put another<br>one down so a tube in the stomach was<br>needed and we fed them through that<br>secondly they needed the bowel Upstream<br>of where it was leaking brought onto the<br>skin so that any contents that came out<br>didn't cause continued infection inside<br>the<br>abdomen and thirdly they needed a tube<br>so that whatever came out could if<br>necessary be put back in again with a<br>tube into the B further Downstream than<br>where the leak<br>was what you put down the tube well we<br>could get infant feeding formul from the<br>local shops so we used that you could<br>get me which is purified Dairy um fat<br>some of the patients use that my<br>favorite was actually Buffalo liver now<br>Buffalo liver can be pressure cooked and<br>then mashed and then it can very un chew<br>it's very high in<br>protein what did these patients come<br>well there were several different causes<br>tuberculosis neglected heras<br>necrotizing intis<br>typhoid trauma and<br>exis here's a 12-year-old boy who was<br>gored by a bull and didn't come to<br>hospital for 15 days he was a dead sto<br>for him I used this<br>technique he went home and he came back<br>3 months later looking like this a<br>shoot I I operated on him and he made a<br>great<br>recovery so how did we do of the high<br>out the STS which means there was more<br>than 500 mils coming out a day I had to<br>operate on 11 of them if I operated<br>within the first 10 days I could do all<br>of the things I wanted to and five out<br>of six of them survived and they to the<br>Clos if I operated later than 10 days<br>four of th five of those patients<br>actually didn't survive<br>because the inter abdominal cavity was<br>almost obliterated by the inflammation<br>associated with the fish that going on<br>so it became clear you need to operate<br>early and you need to bring the bowel<br>out onto the skin to prevent the ongoing<br>infection so the overall mortality for<br>high output Fula was 38% after we<br>introduced<br>this there many there seven patients<br>with low output fs and these were<br>actually pretty easy to treat they could<br>be feared usually orally I had to Fe two<br>of the tube and all of them<br>survived so in conclusion as far as<br>managing small B Fula we could bring the<br>mortality down including the low output<br>to 24% using what I was do we need to<br>operate early if if they had official<br>postoperatively but if they're going to<br>die they die of uncontrolled sepis and<br>malnutrition<br>usually what does this mean<br>globally earlier this year I spoke with<br>the president of the East Western and<br>South African College of Surgeons he<br>told me that almost every hospital<br>across Africa would have at least one<br>patient with a fisa a year and the same<br>would be true of Asia almost all of<br>those patients<br>die with a simple treatment like this<br>many of these patients could actually be<br>saved it just takes the courage to be<br>able to operate on them early enough and<br>and deal with the contamination that's<br>in 1998 we left Nepal with very mixed<br>feelings i' have to say and our family<br>moved back here to Oakland we left<br>behind many Nepali doctors who I've been<br>involved in training this picture at the<br>top shows three surgeons I trained the<br>one on the the one on the left is now<br>Professor gimy he is the head of surgery<br>at the Mony P medical school the surgeon<br>in the middle died a few years after I<br>left of gastric<br>cancer the surgeon on the right is Dr<br>gurum Who is now the chief surgeon at<br>Western Regional Hospital is doing far<br>there I arrived back in New Zealand and<br>there were two wonderful mentors for me<br>Ryan Perry was head of surgery at that<br>stage and he was willing to offer me a<br>job as a lecturer in the department of<br>surgery and Graham Hill offered me a<br>research project and offered to<br>supervise me they could see potential in<br>me and I had a chance for a second go at<br>life in New Zealand at that stage and<br>grahe Hill introduced me to the<br>challenges of managing retal cancer<br>which brought me to the second of my<br>malignant B ker was a major issue in New<br>Zealand about 3,000 new cases are<br>diagnosed a year and about 900 of those<br>have Ral cancer the big problem with<br>rectal cancer is that it is very<br>difficult to remove it is surrounded by<br>major blood vessel important newes<br>gynecological and<br>neurological uh structures all within a<br>fixed bony pelvis that doesn't expand so<br>operating on rental cancer is like<br>working in the dark down down a Long<br>Hall and the problem with<br>this the major problem with rep at that<br>stage was the cancer coming back in the<br>pelvis after the operation had occurred<br>there were two new developments in the<br>1990s one was by a British surgeon<br>called Bill Hill and he described<br>meticulous operating down in the pelvis<br>to remove rectal cancer without cutting<br>into the can<br>the second was research that came out of<br>Sweden which showed that if you gave<br>radio therapy to patients with rectal<br>cancer before they had their operation<br>you reduce the chance of the cancer<br>coming back locally by<br>50% the problem was radiother therapy<br>was associated with several side effects<br>in continents of urine in continents of<br>store and an increased risk of sexual<br>dysfunction so we were situation how do<br>we best manage these<br>answer we start gr H already described a<br>technique that he was using which is<br>very similar to that of Bill heel and he<br>called extra facial excision of the<br>R so my first task was to find out was<br>there any difference between patients<br>who were treated with extra facial<br>exision of the rectum and patients who<br>had conventional Can surgery so I Carri<br>out this stud with Glen maai who was<br>being a junior doctor working with<br>us this involved<br>315 Ral cancer patients who' been<br>operated on at least 5 years earlier for<br>over a 16year period and we looked at<br>the Patients who' been treated with<br>extra exision and those who had<br>conventional surgery particularly<br>looking at what happened in terms of<br>local<br>curs what we found was surprising and<br>actually caused quite a SE across New<br>Zealand and even into<br>Australia the dotted line shows the<br>conventional the local recur rate in the<br>conventional surgery patients by 5 years<br>30% of them had the cancer recurred<br>within the pelvis in the extra fascial<br>exision group it was less than<br>10% not only that but the cancer free<br>survival was significantly greater<br>in the group that had extrafascial<br>exision with 73% being cancer free at 5<br>years as opposed to<br>62% in the conventional Surgery<br>Group there were several things that<br>needed sorting<br>out there are three evident groups that<br>have recently published on the anatomy<br>of the area a group from Germany a group<br>from New York and a group from Japan and<br>all of them thought that the nerves that<br>Supply the important structures in the<br>pelvis lay inside the f that we were<br>supposed to be removing to try and take<br>the cancer<br>out so I was passed with try to work out<br>what the anatomical planes really were<br>like most of the studies that have been<br>published were involved dissection of<br>fixed tissue which is quite hard and<br>difficult to dissect so I was going to<br>dissect fresh tissue and in fact I was<br>going to start by dissecting specimens<br>removed this is a a specimen REM from a<br>patient who's had the rtim removed with<br>an extra fasal dection the main thing I<br>things I needed to identify was does the<br>FAS completely surround the rectum as<br>the studies previously said it only<br>covered the posterior back part of the<br>rectum and were the nerves inside or<br>outside this<br>layer the first patient I had was a<br>young man who had OS colitis who was<br>failing all other treat and needed his<br>for call on and his reum removed and he<br>agreed to me taking his reum doing some<br>external so I got the straight from the<br>I took it from from gr Hill went off to<br>the to the office and started dissecting<br>it with with instruments there within<br>the next two hours I made my way down<br>and around the rectum and after fixation<br>show that the this the rectum actually<br>was completely surrounded by the fashion<br>pray that's the fashion of the retim and<br>it could be removed like a s<br>so that if you stayed outside the fash<br>appropriate you could actually remove<br>all of the rectum with its supporting F<br>and lymphatics and blood<br>vesses I looked at 13 different<br>specimens I showed that the fash appro<br>was thicker at the back than it was at<br>the front which means dissecting<br>initially at the back right on where the<br>fash was thickest made it easier to give<br>to the right plane I also show little<br>the attachments of the Fashion appr on<br>this slide on your left is the fash<br>appropriate and on your right is the<br>Rector and the two are fused together<br>with a lower part of the rect to reach<br>the upper part of the<br>anus at that point if there is a cancer<br>then there's no leeway with the<br>operation and this has been the basis of<br>understanding that for very low R<br>cancers we need to actually go even<br>wider to make sure we remove the cancer<br>without cutting into<br>it<br>this is all very well but the question<br>remained as to how before surgery would<br>we know whether the cancer was going to<br>be completely removed when we operated<br>in the extra fral<br>plane in the early '90s in the early<br>1990s on CT and MRI there noticed a line<br>that appeared around the the rectum so<br>in this picture the black bit in the<br>middle of the rectum the arrows are<br>pointing at the line which is sitting in<br>my task was to try and identify whether<br>this line actually represented the FES<br>appropriate my uh studies that shown the<br>F appr was only 200 microns<br>thick and the finest detail of<br>resolution of an MRI at that stage was<br>just 1 mm which is five times bigger<br>than the than the thickness of the fesh<br>appropriate so we decided on a rather<br>daring experiment we decided that we<br>would take a Gava we' put it through the<br>M scanner we would then in the in the<br>MRI rooms set up an operating theater<br>operate on the kadava put a marker in<br>the right plane and then put it<br>back into the MRI scan and see where the<br>marker actually<br>lay so you might recognize some of the<br>faces here this is us waiting after we'<br>done all that dection it took a long<br>time was relatively late at night and<br>this was out at middlemore because they<br>had the best MRI scanner at that stage<br>in in 199<br>98 we were<br>waiting this shows the results on the<br>left is the<br>predection MRI with the white arrows<br>showing this line that we were looking<br>at on the right is the post de section<br>and you can see the very black area with<br>The Black Arrow Head is the marker that<br>we put we put in place and we had<br>actually now shown that if we looked at<br>an MRI we were looking at the F<br>appropriate this lining around the<br>rectum we saw that<br>line that wasn't enough we now had to<br>show whether we could tell how far the<br>cancer was away from that line before<br>surgery to help us decide who should get<br>radio therapy before they actually had<br>their<br>surgery so the next experiment involved<br>two<br>Radiologists David huff and chera<br>Fernando a pathologist Kai CH who's<br>still working with us and they went back<br>over the last 40 patients who had ereal<br>cancer and looked at their pre-operative<br>MRI and reported independently as to how<br>deep that cancer had invaded and whether<br>it was actually encroaching on the fash<br>appropriate or not and then we compared<br>that with the pathology reports we got<br>from K CH here are the<br>results the picture on your left is a<br>patient with cancer that is just through<br>the wall of the rum and you can see<br>the I can probably use my pointer even<br>you can see this is the the cancer here<br>this isn't going through the wall just<br>going through the wall That's the next<br>slide<br>and this is the fash appr so the long<br>distance between on this side there is a<br>cancer here which is actually invading<br>right out to the F appropriate they were<br>able to correctly predict in 38 40 of<br>these patients what the relationship<br>between the cancer and the fiate was a<br>95% accuracy and so that g gave us<br>confidence to use this as the basis for<br>making clinical decisions with<br>patients this caught on not just at<br>Orland hospital but right across Orland<br>and so that 10 years later we were able<br>then to look at what was happening when<br>we used this so from Northshore hospital<br>and midore hospital we gathered patients<br>who had an MRI scan of their rectal<br>cancer a decision made on the basis of<br>that as to whether they have radio<br>therapy or not to try and reduce the<br>cancer and then<br>surgery what did we<br>find we F found that using this approach<br>the local recurrence rate for cancer out<br>to 5 years was just over<br>6% which was comparable with the very<br>best results in the<br>literature but only 27% of the patients<br>had had to have radio therapy so we were<br>confident that using this approach we<br>could select patients appropriately who<br>needed radiother therapy and spare the<br>others so they could go straight forward<br>to have their<br>operation so what were the implications<br>of this about 3ar of patients can<br>probably be speared having preoperative<br>radiotherapy and its<br>complications and that now in the<br>present setting compared with just 15 to<br>20 years ago the local recurrence rate<br>for for rectal cancer in Oakland is<br>actually very<br>low this brings me to the third of my<br>topics the<br>unmentionable and the unmentionable is<br>FAL in<br>continence this condition is doubly<br>debilitating the patients have to manage<br>very difficult symptoms<br>themselves and they're also socially<br>isolated this socially isolated because<br>most of them are actually too afraid to<br>even talk to their closest friends about<br>the problem they have they manage it in<br>silence I think of it actually as the<br>modern-day leprosy these are patients<br>who are always feeling as though they<br>are<br>unclean they can't leave home for fear<br>of an<br>accident and so these patients suffer<br>mostly in<br>silence it's not very common you might<br>say and I had thought the same thing and<br>when we look at the literature the the<br>um population studies that look at its<br>prevalence very greatly from 4% of the<br>population to 19% of the adult<br>population so we decided to try and find<br>out what it was like in New<br>Zealand so we set out to perform a New<br>Zealand prevalence study of the<br>community Evan sham who's who's here<br>tonight did the study did the study with<br>me it involved a postal questionnaire<br>sent out<br>to uh randomly<br>identified uh individuals from the<br>Electoral<br>role the questionnaire involved a<br>validated um Von continent score a Falon<br>continent quality<br>life evidence about<br>constipation and other demographic data<br>we started with<br>2,000 uh individuals and sent out<br>questionnaires to them this made the<br>prevalence data for the whole population<br>we then sent out another 2,200<br>questionnaires so that we had a<br>comparable number of Mai and non-mi so<br>that we could work out how ethnicity<br>this here's a very pleased with the<br>number of responses that we had I think<br>it was amazing that we got almost a 60%<br>response rate for a very sensitive stay<br>sent<br>out the non-mi response rate was almost<br>was was almost 60 was 60% and the Mari<br>response rate was almost<br>50% what did we actually<br>find FAL in continence was much more<br>common than I thought when we defined<br>FAL incontinent as having at least one<br>episode so of either liquid or solid in<br>continents of sto per month 12.6% of the<br>adult population in New Zealand said<br>they had it that's one<br>and8 looking at constipation one in<br>three across the population had<br>this how did Mari and nonmi<br>compare well the Mari prevalence rate is<br>actually 18.2% significantly higher than<br>nonm Mar as was their constipation rate<br>what<br>other um risk factors did we identify on<br>multivariate<br>analysis socioeconomic status so those<br>with a lower socioeconomic status were<br>more likely to have incontinence those<br>who had previous operations on the anal<br>Canal were more likely to have<br>incontinence perhaps understandably and<br>those with diabetes interestingly were<br>also much more likely to have freal<br>incontinence how many people had ever<br>talked to any health professional about<br>this well only 40% so the majority of<br>patients with these symptoms had never<br>spoken to anyone who might be able to<br>help them it's not surprising that it's<br>so difficult for these patients if<br>they're not even able to talk to their<br>their health<br>practitioners the management of feal<br>incontinence is mostly relatively<br>straightforward we would take a careful<br>history we would examine them there are<br>several investigations we do and<br>including an ultrasound to see whether<br>the muscles are intact an x-ray to see<br>if the bowel is collapsing down and<br>prolapsing um and often uh pressure<br>measurements of the of the anal<br>Canal more than 95% of patients with Inc<br>continence can be managed with<br>conservative measures this usually means<br>adjusting the<br>diet pelvic floor<br>physiotherapy optimizing<br>medication and adding something usually<br>low paramid to try and make the motion a<br>little firmer so that it's easier to<br>hold on<br>to about 95% of patients are better with<br>just those measures unfortunately<br>there's a few who aren't and we up until<br>recently had three things we could do we<br>could Stitch we could hitch or we could<br>ditch stitching we we offered to<br>patients who had a torn sphincter now<br>this happens mostly during a very<br>traumatic child birth in and women and<br>when that happens we're able to join the<br>sphincter muscle Back Together Again by<br>stitching it overlapping itself some<br>patients have what's called prolapse<br>where the bowel is collapsing and coming<br>down into and out through the the back<br>passage we manage that by hitching the<br>bowel up and fixing it to the<br>sacrum our so-called ROP<br>pixie patients who couldn't be offered<br>those two the only other thing we had to<br>offer was a colostomy that's bringing<br>the bowel out onto the<br>skin and putting a bag on in fact<br>ditching the rest of the<br>rectum in the late 1990s and early 2000s<br>a new treatment was starting to be uh<br>described and some of the results seemed<br>too good to be<br>true this involved a stimulating some of<br>the sacral nerves as they come out<br>through the bone into the the<br>pelvis<br>and randomized control trials that<br>appeared in the early 2000s suggested<br>that this could be used on those<br>patients with severe feal Inc condence<br>that the only other option would have<br>been a<br>colostomy by 2009 I was convinced that<br>we ought to start doing that here in New<br>Zealand and we started offering this<br>treatment this treatment involves having<br>a patient flat on the table on their<br>stomach putting a needle through the<br>sacrum till we identify the nerve as it<br>comes out through the bone the third<br>sacral nerve that supplies the pelvic<br>floor and then passing a lead with four<br>electrodes through that needle so that<br>it's lying alongside the<br>nerve and then bringing that out through<br>the skin and attaching it to a<br>stimulator that continuously stimulates<br>those<br>electrodes we would ask the patients to<br>fill out a a diary prior to all of this<br>happening so this is the Baseline diary<br>of the first patient that we managed in<br>this way the area inside the red box<br>shows the number of episodes of fecal<br>incontinence each day for that week in<br>this patient there were<br>12 once we did the stimulator on this<br>patient this is her first week with the<br>stimulator turned on there wasn't a<br>single episode of feal cont I actually<br>didn't believe it this was better than I<br>could possibly have<br>thought if they have a good response<br>like this we then go on to implant a<br>stimulator very similar to a pacemaker<br>that's used for the heart and and that's<br>placed in the in the buttock and<br>continuously stimulates the<br>lead what have our results been like<br>these are the results we had at the end<br>of last year when we had 74 patients<br>involved of the 74 patients<br>there were nine who had no improvement<br>with the trial stimulation and they no<br>longer went on with that and some of<br>those have gone on to have a<br>colostomy 88% however did have a<br>response and they all had the stimulator<br>implanted and of those only six have had<br>secondary failure and had to have the<br>stimulator removed so in fact 80% of the<br>people who we've put into this have<br>ended up with a successful result with a<br>with a stimulator<br>what does a successful result look like<br>now this is looking at the patient<br>number of episodes of fecal incontinence<br>per week and looking at the median<br>number so the median number of patients<br>prior to to having the stimulator was<br>seven episodes per week the median<br>number at the last followup of these<br>patients was one per week and in fact<br>for 40% of the patients it was Zero per<br>week we looked at their quality of life<br>this is a group of 15 patients who we<br>had pre and post quality of life and all<br>but one of them had a marked improvement<br>in their quality of life now those are<br>just lines on a page<br>actually not many people would want to<br>hug their color surgeon but these are<br>do they come back to me and they say<br>I've got my life back I can actually go<br>out<br>now I can go have a meal go out to lunch<br>with my<br>friends so how does this<br>work well the short answer is we don't<br>know the longer answer is we're trying<br>to find<br>out the third sacral nerve route is a<br>very important spot that nerve does four<br>things that are all important in in<br>maintaining<br>continence it's involved in the motor<br>activity to the pelvic floor and the<br>anal sphincter it's involved in the<br>sensation of what's happening in the<br>rectum it's involved in sending signals<br>back to the brain to tell tell you<br>what's happening and bringing signals<br>back again and we think most importantly<br>it's involved in the autonomic nervous<br>system that involves the contractility<br>of the lower part of the bow above the<br>rectum recently a<br>new tool has been developed which is a<br>high resolution<br>manometer and and this gives us the<br>ability to measure the pressure in the<br>bowel every centimeter along its<br>length what we are now doing is trying<br>to understand what is happening with the<br>contractility of the distal colon and<br>how important is this in maintaining<br>continence and in the effect of sacral<br>nerve<br>stimulation here is a closer look at the<br>end of one of these these manometers<br>every centimeter is a fiber optic<br>reading nine healthy<br>volunteers bless them agreed to<br>undergo a manometry of the distal colon<br>it involved placing the monometer with a<br>colonoscope and then taking an x-ray<br>afterwards the X-ray you can see on your<br>right shows the monometer going up<br>through the colon up to about the<br>splenic<br>flexure and we could measure exactly<br>where the menom<br>um receptors were in terms of the<br>colon this is a picture of our manometry<br>team getting one of these manometers<br>calibrated the manometer is clipped in<br>place with the<br>colonoscope now you have to pay<br>attention this is a difficult slide<br>these are the<br>results the line that's running along<br>goes for 4 hours and the the from the<br>top of the blue to the bottom of the<br>blue goes from the upper part of the<br>manometer to the lower part and uh the<br>color shows the intensity of the the<br>intensity of the color shows the<br>pressure at each of those levels after 2<br>hours we gave the subjects a meal the<br>area we're most interested in is the 2<br>hours following the<br>meal and when we look at that up<br>close especially if we look at it with a<br>line diagram you will see what's<br>happening to these pressure<br>waves the pressure waves are actually<br>moving from lower down up the colon<br>what's called retrograde contractions<br>and they're very frequent they're<br>happening about three times a minute and<br>that's called the cyclic activity of the<br>colon we looked at what sorts of<br>activity we were seeing with<br>this the vast majority of the activity<br>was retrograde going back up the colon<br>and the vast majority of<br>that was cyclic motor<br>patterns 72 of the 107 were actually<br>retrograde cyclic motor patterns and and<br>fewer were integrade we then wanted to<br>know where did these waves<br>start the anr ones were starting further<br>up the bow and almost none starting at<br>the rectum or just above the rectum<br>the retrograde ones were almost all<br>starting in the rectum and moving back<br>upwards what we've shown is that this<br>seems to<br>be a retrograde activity in the distal<br>part of the lower part of the Bale that<br>acts a bit like the a recto sigmoid<br>break and we think are is important in<br>maintaining<br>continents we are now looking at<br>patients who have got a sacral nerve<br>stimulator inserted and seeing what<br>different um programs do to this<br>particular activity and we've enrolled<br>eight of the 15 patients that we need<br>Tony Lynn is doing that who's with us<br>here<br>tonight in some ways our research has<br>come full<br>circle rash Vader who's also here<br>tonight and flown up with jvin from um<br>New Plymouth he spent 3 years with me<br>trying to understand another condition<br>that causes starvation around surgery<br>this is postoperative IAS this is a<br>failure of the bow to return its<br>activity after an operation and it<br>results in abdominal distension vomiting<br>inability to eat and inability to pass a<br>bow<br>motion what Rees has done is<br>to uh provide a clinically usable<br>definition help us with the uh<br>conservative management and and produced<br>some recommendations and how we might do<br>that we've carried out a randomized<br>controlled trial of a therapeutic option<br>which actually wasn't as good as we<br>thought it might be and he's produced a<br>RIS risk prediction model that will help<br>us to know who's likely to get IAS and<br>how we might manage<br>them I'm excited about where we're going<br>from here this is a picture of our<br>research team at<br>present there are many things that we're<br>looking at Tony<br>mil is continuing the work work of rash<br>and is about to start a new randomized<br>control trial looking at another novel<br>agent that we'll be try using to try and<br>actually prevent postoperative<br>IAS Celia Keen is looking at a different<br>bow problem that's associated with<br>removal of part or all of the rectum<br>called anterior reection<br>syndrome Rebecca Jang is doing a a<br>randomized control trial that will<br>answer the question whether we

it's<br>exciting for me to be involved in some<br>research again in low and middle in<br>countries lanang is a a junior Doctor<br>Who's been assisting us in our some of<br>our incent studies and Gregor Grady is a<br>new associate professor who's in the<br>department and has his fingers in more<br>pies than he has fingers actually but<br>he's co co-supervising some of my<br>students and is already an an<br>international leader in terms of<br>intestinal<br>motility there are so many people I need<br>need to<br>think my many collaborators who have<br>worked with me particularly my<br>undergraduate and postgraduate<br>students Lois Blackwell who has acted as<br>my PA as well as looking after the<br>administration of the whole of the<br>Department of su are you here<br>Lois thank you<br>Lois she keeps me Sayan some of the<br>time to my coloral colleagues Brian<br>Perry Aaron Mary Julian Hayes Rowan<br>Collinson nagam elani and grego Grady<br>they have many times stepped into the<br>breach where my academic duties have<br>called me away from patience and my<br>patients have done well with<br>that it's been a privilege working with<br>them I need to mention the patients<br>because all the way through there have<br>been patients who have been willing to<br>submit themselves to unmentionable<br>investigations to be part of what we're<br>doing<br>better and finally to my wonderful<br>family to Peter and<br>B to Miriam and Sue to Bix and Mike<br>thank you thank you for understanding<br>when my um mind seems to be somewhere<br>else when you're talking to me it is<br>usually and of course to Joe who who<br>Stood Beside Me in the strongest<br>possible way supported me and has taken<br>many risks with me I couldn't have done<br>it without<br>him so thank you all who've come to hear<br>this tonight I hope you've enjoyed it<br>you<br>Professor Ian Bisset thank you for an<br>extraordinary address the starved the<br>malignant and the<br>unmentionable I'm sold if I was a rich<br>member of the local land of gentry some<br>hundred years ago you would have my<br>patronage<br>I'll see you<br>later at the outset I was really struck<br>by the Applause you received before you<br>even started the respect that you're<br>held<br>in is reflected not only on the number<br>and diversity of the people who have<br>attended but in that Applause which was<br>prolonged at<br>heartfelt and in your lecture we have<br>we heard from Professor<br>Perry about your intensely practical<br>ability which manifests a school in your<br>sporting achievements we heard that from<br>Professor Perry not from you which is<br>characteristic of your<br>modesty and it's long been I've I am an<br>anst for those people who don't know<br>that fact and I have spent a lot of my<br>life working with surgeons and it is my<br>view that the majority of good ones are<br>capable practically and they are usually<br>good Sportsmen there are exceptions but<br>it is normally the case and what we have<br>seen is how that practical ability<br>translated into the work that you<br>undertook first in Nepal and then later<br>in New<br>Zealand but it was underpinned by an<br>astute academic<br>honesty that was committed to collecting<br>data on your<br>outcomes not all of which were perhaps<br>what you wanted to see but to then<br>analyzing the reasons and coming up<br>again practically with solutions to<br>improve the outcomes of your<br>patients Professor Perry talked about<br>leaders producing leaders and we heard<br>about that also both in Nepal how you<br>left behind a legacy of leaders and<br>indeed in New Zealand how you continue<br>to do that<br>your work on the 200 Micron thick FAS<br>appropria is just astonishing and<br>reminded me why I decided not to pursue<br>a general surgical career extraordinary<br>difficult your description of the silent<br>disease modern day<br>leprosy was very moving but I was also<br>struck as a person interested in quality<br>and safety of healthcare and the right<br>way to manage patients how the majority<br>of your patients you manage<br>conservatively with simple sensible<br>practical measures but for the<br>remainder you have introduced a a high<br>tech very<br>sophisticated uh stimulation therapy<br>which has in your words given back the<br>patients many people think that research<br>just can't teach well we've seen tonight<br>with your<br>stunningly um arresting lecture I mean I<br>was just riveted through the whole of it<br>that that's not true because you clearly<br>are a researcher and you clearly can<br>teach many people also think that<br>academics are inhabitants of an ivory<br>tower that deal<br>with esoteric topics that have no use to<br>anybody well we've seen how far from the<br>truth that is today and I believe in our<br>faculty and in the school of medicine in<br>particular you illustrate how untrue<br>that is with the work that you've done<br>and that that many of your colleagues in<br>those in that area do do do if you go<br>back to the thought about the<br>relationship between tan and Gan and the<br>idea that perhaps the gown in some way<br>has no relevance to the T well we've<br>seen how wrong that is we have seen how<br>your intensely practical but<br>rigorously academic work contributes<br>enormously to the lives of the citizens<br>of our town and of the people in<br>Nepal as you<br>said you have given so many people back<br>their lives here and in<br>Nepal in our school as in in the school<br>of population health and school of<br>Medical Science<br>we are tasked with producing the future<br>medical Workforce of New<br>Zealand and to do that it is critically<br>important that we have people that are<br>not only teachers and academics but are<br>Role<br>Models role models of the kind of doctor<br>that we want in the future in New<br>Zealand and what we've seen<br>today is that you are an incredible role<br>model for our medical students in fact<br>you're an inspiration for them<br>for all of us and also may I say for me<br>lecture uh thank thank you all very much<br>for coming tonight thank you Professor<br>Parry uh
