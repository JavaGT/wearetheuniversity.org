In this easy to understand presentation Dr O’Sullivan demonstrates how DNA is wrapped and folded in our cells, and explains how this ‘packaging’ modifies the personal DNA sequence that contributes to your growth and learning, and your chances of developing diseases like obesity and diabetes.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and our first Speaker this evening is Dr<br>Justin Sullivan Justin is a senior<br>research fellow and recently took up the<br>role of associate director for research<br>at the liens Institute he is a genome<br>biologist undertaking Cutting Edge<br>Research into how the way your DNA is<br>packaged within your cells affects the<br>genes that are<br>expressed Justin took a first class BSC<br>honors in cellular and molecular biology<br>from the University of Canterbury in<br>1994 and PhD from the University of TGO<br>in<br>1998 he studied at the University of<br>Oxford as a postdoctoral fellow before<br>returning to New Zealand initially<br>working at Massi University before<br>joining the University of Oakland in<br>2012<br>Justin thank you very much um I got a<br>got off the plane this morning uh and uh<br>wrote my talk shortly<br>thereafter uh so hopefully it will go<br>okay so we study<br>genomes and when I look around me and I<br>look around this theater I see a lot of<br>different people and what you all have<br>is very similar genetic material very<br>similar genetic makeup but it's those<br>variations in that makeup that make you<br>make us who we are what we try to do is<br>to understand that and how that works<br>and one of the key things about this is<br>that the human genome and this here is<br>the uh sorry this is this is the uh<br>nature publication that published a<br>human genome in 2012 2 sorry not<br>2012 um but this here was touted as<br>having the information that made us who<br>we are it was touted as providing the<br>basis for understanding human<br>disease and risk and in fact it<br>does but the way it explains it is not<br>as simple as people perceive it's not<br>simply in the order of the genes and the<br>linear sequence of the DNA it comes down<br>to the way those genes are regulated the<br>way they interact with the environment<br>and at the ligans a number of people<br>study this we study the interface<br>DNA let me show you something to start<br>with that illustrates why this is very<br>important so genetic information this is<br>olive oil by the way genetic<br>information is not simply enough to make<br>an<br>individual if I P this solive oil on the<br>surface here it illustrates very simply<br>the process of membrane formation so<br>membranes that surround your cells that<br>surround your DNA the information for<br>this is not present in the DNA itself<br>rather it's present in the self<br>assembly of these my cells let me see if<br>this works hope it does oh hang<br>on it's<br>coming can you see the my dropped down<br>as we put the salt on that the oil forms<br>a myel it forms a cell around the salt<br>it protects the salt as it goes through<br>the column and when it hits the bottom<br>the salt is deposited so not all<br>information is actually encoded in the<br>DNA itself and in the sequence of DNA<br>this typee of information is<br>not but inside each of your cells you<br>have<br>approximately sorry 2 m of DNA roughly<br>this long okay in every one of your<br>cells now if I was to take someone here<br>and mulch them and extract all of their<br>DNA and uh ethics tell me I'm not<br>allowed to do that but if I was to do<br>that and line your DNA up into to end it<br>would go from here to the Sun and back<br>about 300 times Maybe a few more it<br>still be too small to see too thin to<br>see but that's what it would do now<br>every one of yourselves has this 2 m of<br>DNA so it's stuffed effectively into a<br>container like this okay just whacked in<br>there but in that container where the<br>DNA tacks up about 5% of the volume you<br>things I didn't tell my wife I was<br>looking all decorations<br>but they're all stuck in the cell as<br>well and they are key to making it all<br>work but the thing about this is that<br>it's not a randomly<br>mixed<br>bag it's not a closed system like this<br>jar it's an open system energy goes into<br>that system and when energy goes into it<br>it's used to create structure to give it<br>order to maintain that order and by<br>doing that we can regulate genes we<br>create a structure in which things work<br>together in<br>order to give you the characteristics<br>that you have and a simple way to show<br>this is effectively with these<br>chromosomes okay so I have two<br>chromosomes and they<br>have an epigenetic Mark okay and an<br>epigenetic Mark is simply something that<br>responds to the environment and is put<br>on top of the DNA and controls the way<br>the DNA is r<br>now if I have two epigenetic marks on<br>this red chromosome and I have a blue<br>chromosome and I put them into a nucle<br>and I fold them<br>randomly and create a ball okay you'll<br>see that what's happened is the red<br>chromosome has folded around itself okay<br>it's intermingling a bit with the blue<br>chromosome and that's all great the<br>epigenetic marks have disappeared<br>but if and this is where this goes<br>horribly wrong if I cut this nucleus<br>open okay I've got hopefully get this<br>the right<br>way oh there you go look at that perfect<br>what you'll see okay is that those red<br>or those green areas all right they came<br>together okay and they came together at<br>one point here and now they're linking<br>red and blue and red and effectively<br>they've created an environment and it's<br>an environment that traps factors that<br>regulate genes it makes the genes work<br>consistently it helps them work<br>consistently and it helps them<br>ultimately give you your phenotype your<br>control but the thing about that is that<br>DNA just like this doesn't fold one way<br>you have approximately 200 different<br>cells in your body each one of those<br>cells has the same DNA<br>content if they all have the same DNA<br>content how can they possibly be<br>different one way they're different is<br>illustrated by this ball okay it's a<br>green ball all right very nice unless I<br>throw it now it's an orange ball okay<br>this ball has exactly the same DNA or<br>information<br>content as this green ball because it's<br>the same thing all that happens is it<br>refolds one way or another okay I would<br>pass it around I've got two of them but<br>okay so the balls have the same content<br>but your cells are the same you fold the<br>DNA one way it's an orange DNA orange<br>cell fold it another way it's a green<br>cell okay really cool nice simple thing<br>now seems easy to study this if it's a<br>ball all right but DNA is not a ball DNA<br>is in fact a ribbon like structure a<br>polymer like<br>structure like these okay so what we do<br>here at the ligans is a very very simple<br>technique okay and we can capture the<br>structure of the DNA in a Cell very<br>simply and I'll illustrate it to you<br>like this we have two chromosomes and<br>they're contacting each other at one<br>point okay so within the cell they<br>other apparently you have to be careful<br>how you say that I said that in the<br>states and some people wenten to<br>impressed<br>the chromosomes contact each other at<br>one point okay here what we can do is we<br>can chemically tie these things<br>together and then in the lab we take<br>scissors molecular scissors and these<br>molecular scissors basically cut up our<br>chromosomes and they cut it up real<br>simple at a whole lot of sites that we<br>know because we<br>know the<br>sequence what we then do is we take some<br>molecular<br>staplers they come along and they join<br>the ends of these bits of DNA<br>together okay we can then remove all<br>this stuff that we put in here and we<br>end up with a circular DNA molecule but<br>the circular DNA molecule is made up of<br>a bit of white chromosome and a bit of<br>black chromosome okay and these two bits<br>of chromosomes are the bits of<br>chromosomes that were contacting each<br>other inside the cell so from all the<br>three billion base of DNA that were<br>there we can say that one black bit and<br>one white bit were contacting each other<br>in the cell and that's what we do and by<br>doing that we're able to<br>study whether we have<br>green or orange formations of the DNA<br>and this tells us a lot about your<br>chances of getting obesity about your<br>chances of getting diabetes about how<br>well you can grow about cognition and<br>other aspects because the variance that<br>you have in your DNA invariably don't<br>fall in<br>genes invariably they sit outside of<br>genes because most of your DNA is not<br>genes most of it is what was called<br>Junk most of the VAR fall on that junk<br>region but the key thing about the junk<br>is it's not<br>junk it's like this little knob here<br>okay and what it does is it contacts a<br>number of genes around it physically in<br>space and when it does that it can turn<br>those genes on or turn those genes<br>off and that's the key to understanding<br>a lot of the variation that's the key to<br>understanding why some of us grow taller<br>why some of us are shorter why some of<br>us might be smarter there's a<br>contribution from the genetic<br>inheritance why some of us have a higher<br>risk of getting obesity or diabetes it's<br>an understanding<br>that<br>now the cell itself<br>is a bit like<br>this okay it's under tension it's not a<br>soft bag it doesn't sort of flop around<br>like this it has<br>structure and this is really interesting<br>to understand okay an important thing to<br>understand because cells move in the<br>body and when they move they go through<br>holes some cells your immune cells for<br>example migrate through pores and those<br>pores that they migrate through are<br>really very<br>small but because your cell has tension<br>if we push on one part of it it changes<br>the structure elsewhere<br>okay and that's really very important to<br>understand and it's important to<br>understand because and one of my<br>students Elsie is working on this at the<br>moment but it's important to understand<br>because I'll just get rid of this<br>junk here if we have two pieces of DNA<br>and they present in the cell<br>this black one and it has a little Loop<br>in it oh sorry you can't see that has a<br>little Loop in it held together by a<br>couple of red proteins okay here and<br>here this white one which is held<br>together by Blue proteins here and here<br>if these two regions are actually<br>contacting each other and held together<br>in three dimensions like<br>this if we change the structure of the<br>cell and the<br>cell like this is under tension so that<br>when we push on one part we change the<br>structure somewhere else<br>what<br>happens what happens is you get instant<br>regulation you get instant regulation<br>because if I take this and do hopefully<br>region oh it's<br>stuck oh that's no<br>good the looped region contacts itself<br>oh it didn't<br>work I I see that's terrible isn't it<br>okay the loop region contacts itself<br>that's stuck um and what's supposed to<br>happen is this one here is actually<br>supposed to join on as<br>well and the complex changes so that now<br>I have a string of paper clips instead<br>of individual paper clips so what can<br>happen in the cell is that when you<br>squeeze it through a particular tight<br>hole like as an immune cell does when<br>moves out to a sight of<br>infection like what happens when you<br>jump up and down on the spot and the leg<br>all right you you're getting compression<br>and cells in your legs<br>Etc you can change complexes you can<br>cause instant<br>regulation so that is what we're trying<br>to understand in terms of a<br>three-dimensional<br>structure of the<br>DNA thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
