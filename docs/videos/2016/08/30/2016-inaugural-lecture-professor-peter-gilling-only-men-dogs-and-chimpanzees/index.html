second of our inaugural lecture<br>series for<br>2016 it's always a delight to see so<br>many colleagues friends and families<br>here uh from both inside and outside the<br>faculty uh the process of University<br>inauguration serves two<br>purposes the first is an expression of<br>acknowledgement and welcome a reception<br>for new professors joining the circle of<br>esteemed colleagues within the<br>professorate the second and most<br>important is to showcase the subject and<br>the story of the new professor their<br>Maiden lecture as an esteemed and<br>eminent academic at the University of<br>Oakland the inaugural lecture series is<br>a highlight of our academic calendar and<br>this year we welcome three new<br>professors into the<br>professor so academic inauguration dates<br>back to Medieval Times when it was<br>unashamedly intended to impress upon the<br>public and Rich benefactors the need for<br>their continued<br>patronage indeed professors were chosen<br>not only for their intellectual capacity<br>but also their financial worthiness one<br>tradition required new fellows to be<br>willing and able to entertain all their<br>new colleagues for the duration of the<br>inauguration uh sort of an academic<br>joiners fee today's inaugural lecture<br>you might argue are only slightly more<br>evolved but are now a means of<br>introducing our most eminent staff<br>thankfully at the expense of the<br>university in all serious however<br>elevation to the rank of Professor is a<br>very serious process since for many it<br>represents the Pinnacle of one's<br>academic career the process of selection<br>is long and involved and requires<br>intense scrutiny by other senior<br>colleagues who then seek advice from<br>International peers to confirm that the<br>appointee is internationally eminent<br>within their chosen<br>field inaugural lectures are a wonderful<br>opportunity for colleagues family and<br>friends to learn about the journey that<br>has led to academic success the<br>Milestones the decisions and the mentors<br>who have assisted and helped steer along<br>the path tonight it is my very great<br>pleasure to introduce Professor Peter<br>Gilling Peter is an eminent consultant<br>urologist from Tanga and the head of the<br>University's medical program at Tonga<br>Hospital uh it is my pleasure now to<br>invite Professor Alan Mary head of the<br>school of medicine to provide a formal<br>introduction to Professor<br>Gilling Professor Mary will then invite<br>Professor Gilling to deliv deliver his<br>inaugural dress which will then be<br>followed by some closing remarks from<br>Professor Ian Bisset head of the<br>Department of Medicine Professor<br>Mary thank you Professor Fraser good<br>evening it gives me very great pleasure<br>to introduce Professor Peter<br>Gilling Peter is a busy specialist<br>Urological surgeon working in the Bay of<br>plenty and at the same time he is an<br>acknowledged World Authority in both the<br>research and the treatment of benign<br>prostatic<br>hyperplasia in 2010 he received a<br>doctorate of medicine from the<br>University of Vago which is a higher<br>doctoral degree recognizing his<br>scientific contribution in this<br>field and on the website expertscape he<br>is ranked sixth in the world in this<br>field on scopus which is a database that<br>people like me use to figure out how our<br>staff are doing Peter has over a hundred<br>Publications a very high proportion of<br>which he is first author of he work has<br>been cited over 3,000 times and his H<br>index is 32 the highest for a urologist<br>Asia Peter was elected to the oldest and<br>most influential Society in the<br>specialty of Urology the American<br>Association of genitor urinary<br>surgeons this organization has only 43<br>members from outside the US and only two<br>from Australia New<br>Zealand he chaired the committee on<br>surgical therapies at the recent<br>International consultation of urological<br>disorders guidelines collaboration on<br>benign prostatic<br>hypertrophy he is on the editorial board<br>of six International journals has been<br>visiting Professor or speaker at over 30<br>International institutions and given<br>presentations at innumerable<br>meetings around the<br>world he has been an examiner in urology<br>for the Royal austral Asian College of<br>Surgeons and in 2015 was<br>honored with the society International<br>theology distinguished career award and<br>the Royal austral Asian College of<br>award this faculty amongst other<br>responsibilities is charged through the<br>three schools that administer its<br>medical program with training a<br>substantial part of the future Medical<br>Health force of New Zealand one of our<br>priorities is to address the national<br>shortage of doctors in rural areas and<br>in Primary<br>Healthcare as one strategy to meet this<br>goal we have placed great emphasis on<br>the importance of sites like the Bay of<br>Plenty we have introduced a system of<br>cohorting by which our students spend a<br>year in places like the Bay of Plenty so<br>that they extend their training beyond<br>the walls of major hospitals in<br>Oakland and so it's very important that<br>Peter was instrumental in establishing<br>the Bay of Plenty as an academic site<br>for the university in 2009 and has been<br>the academic lead there since then also<br>he is a member of the steering committee<br>and chair of the local Advisory Group<br>for the University's rural Health<br>interprofessional immersion program<br>based in<br>fatani as if that wasn't enough Peter<br>personally teaches students during their<br>fifth year specialty surgical attachment<br>assesses sixth years following the<br>electives and leads the student pastoral<br>care in<br>Tara delivering our medical program<br>across many sites is actually quite a<br>challenge<br>and depends on collaborative teamwork<br>I'd like to<br>acknowledge the extremely positive<br>relationship that Peter maintains with<br>me and all the many academic and<br>professional staff who work with you to<br>this end Peter thank<br>you more than that producing future<br>doctors who are fitful practice in New<br>Zealand goes far beyond academic<br>education it requires active and<br>credible clinicians who are also<br>researchers and above all are great role<br>models for our medical students<br>Professor Peter Gilling meets all these<br>criteria but in fact as a role model he<br>goes further and importantly<br>demonstrates by example that you don't<br>need to work at a major Center to be all<br>of these things to the highest possible<br>standards I'm looking forward immensely<br>to his inaugural lecture tonight which<br>is entitled only men dog and chimpanzees<br>Professor Peter<br>Gilling<br>thank you very<br>much only men dogs and chimpanzees<br>refers to my research interest which as<br>alen has said is BPH benign prostatic<br>hypoplasia but uh I'm pleased to see<br>John Windsor in the audience because the<br>other two titles of my my talk can I can<br>directly sheet home to him he asked me<br>to speak five years ago<br>on how to succeed in academic surgery<br>from the provinces and I spoke at uh a<br>course for him five years ago and I<br>called my talk salutary experiences and<br>immutable laws to do with becoming an<br>academic in the provinces so I've uh<br>stolen slides from back then and then<br>added the prostate stuff and uh luckily<br>there are a few year old ologist in the<br>audience so at least some of you will<br>understand what I'm talking about but of<br>course if you're in the provinces you've<br>got it all anyway you've got the<br>lifestyle and uh we increasingly have<br>the education without the house uh<br>prices but uh that's changing and um if<br>we can add academic uh associations to<br>that then uh we cover all the<br>bases so I'd just like to first of all<br>just uh back up a bit and give you some<br>uh idea of some of the research<br>experiences I had in my early career<br>which led me to this sort of pathway and<br>um the first salutary experience was<br>when I was a house<br>surgeon and I was gifted the topic of<br>reviewing upper GI Hemorrhage for the<br>previous 20 years by one of the<br>well-meaning general surgeons uh in<br>Christ Church and myself as a house<br>surgeon and a young registrator whose<br>name is uh Dr Steven mun were charged<br>with this<br>task interestingly after 18 months and 2<br>and a half thousand case notes and all<br>our lunchtimes completely uh uh<br>destroyed uh we did come up with a<br>publication but sadly it was turned down<br>for the two journals we uh the only two<br>journals who would have had any interest<br>in it whatsoever and so we came away uh<br>with nothing to really show for that<br>time so my first law to those uh budding<br>academics from that talk was Beware of<br>the meaningless research project which<br>masquerades as research because and I<br>try quite hard not to uh send my<br>registrars down that same pathway my<br>second brush with research was when I<br>was a full-time research fellow during<br>my Urological uh<br>training and uh it was basic science we<br>got little strips of bladder muscle and<br>hooked them up an organ bath and<br>stimulated them with drugs and<br>electricity and things and then tried to<br>link it back to the patient condition<br>and uh and that was all very well and<br>another uh registr followed me and then<br>we came to writing this thing up uh uh<br>for our thesis and uh the supervisor<br>decided that uh all the methodology was<br>fatally flawed and that we should cease<br>and assist at once and so that ground to<br>a halt as well I got a couple of<br>Publications out of it but that was as<br>far as it went so my advice to the<br>registrars is that research is are good<br>but um the topic and the supervisor has<br>to be locked down and uh be given a lot<br>of thought otherwise you'll come away<br>empty-handed as I<br>did the third experience that I'd like<br>to mention was when I was in uh Dallas I<br>did two years as a clinical fellow there<br>and did a research program uh Pro did a<br>research project once again it was basic<br>science but um and this time it was more<br>molecular and looking at the structure<br>of the smooth muscle and various things<br>and it was a large uh academic<br>institution and I was part of a number<br>of projects over that time but<br>interestingly these were published but<br>equally interesting my name wasn't on<br>any of the Publications so I came away<br>again<br>empty-handed and so I would say that<br>these uh research fellowships and and<br>fellowships in General are absolutely<br>invaluable in terms of the collegial<br>stuff but uh once again it doesn't<br>always work out for the<br>best and uh lastly I'd just like to<br>mention at this stage uh the fact and<br>the support that uh I've had in Tower<br>oner to do the work that I've done um I<br>arrived into to a three-man practice and<br>my partner's Harry Watson Mark frorer<br>they were very commercial and I learned<br>a lot from them commercially they didn't<br>have a an academic bone in their bodies<br>but uh we had a unique funding<br>Arrangement which uh started the year<br>after I got there it's a capitated<br>contract whereby the urologists had<br>control of the entire budget and we paid<br>the hospitals for the services that our<br>patients had and it's still 23 years<br>later it's still in<br>existence uh and it's really a seed and<br>soil they were really they really<br>facilitated the stuff that I was doing<br>didn't care too much for it but it uh<br>facilitated it uh nonetheless and so I<br>would say that your surgical Partners<br>also play a big part in your ability to<br>do research and here is where I'd like<br>to acknowledge Mark frorer the reason<br>he's not here is because he's covering<br>me as we speak back in tower on so he<br>would have liked to have been here and<br>uh yeah he sends his regards by the way<br>but he really is he was fundamental and<br>uh the assistance that I got with all my<br>uh research in those early years as a<br>facilitator and and he was actively<br>involved in the early years as well so<br>moving on to the research itself the<br>prostate is only is a small organ the<br>size of a chestnut that sits at the base<br>of the bladder and the urethra the water<br>tube that you pee through that goes<br>through the middle of it so as you age<br>the prostate can enlarge and there's a<br>condition called BPH benign prostatic<br>hypoplasia which has been the focus of a<br>lot of the research projects that I have<br>uh uh been involved in and it affects<br>the areas that we can see here uh the<br>transition zone and the per urethal Zone<br>and they are right close by the uh<br>urethra and we can see the normal<br>prostate here and then the glands<br>overgrow and the and the supporting<br>cells overgrow as well and we get this<br>condition called<br>BPH and this is what people most people<br>uh think of when they think of prostate<br>blockages they think of a a big swollen<br>prostate leading to blockages of the<br>bladder and the bladder getting thick<br>and irritable and causing a lot of these<br>urinary symptoms that you're probably<br>aware of and then that can lead to back<br>pressure on the kidneys and ultimately<br>kidney failure but fortunately that's uh<br>rather<br>uncommon and uh the prostate<br>does uh grow there's no question in<br>Western men it just steadily grows as<br>you age and this is a collection of<br>international studies that have looked<br>at this this<br>topic and it's thought to be sort of an<br>imbalance between the death of cells and<br>the growth of cells such that there's an<br>overgrowth and a proliferation and<br>there's a range of different factors uh<br>that lead into that but really what<br>brings the patients along to see us as<br>urologists is a collection of<br>symptoms called lower urinary tra<br>symptoms and BPH is really only one of<br>the causes that can be causes related to<br>the blood supply to the nerve supply to<br>the bladder muscle there's a range of<br>things that can lead to these lower<br>urinary tract symptoms such that we get<br>this sort of scenario where the green uh<br>circle is the the patients who have<br>BPH but only a proportion of them get<br>enlargement and only a proportion of<br>those with enlargement and symptoms uh<br>get blockages and it's really these ones<br>that we're targeting when we uh offer<br>them surgery and of course there's a<br>whole uh raft of patients who don't have<br>problems uh to do with uh the<br>enlargement of the prostate but still<br>have the lower unit tract symptoms so<br>you can see this is why urologists are<br>paid so much because it's a very complex<br>and tricky<br>area but as you see the prevalence of<br>BPH inevitably goes up so by the time<br>you're 90 it's something like 90% of<br>people have the hyic condition if you<br>look down the microscope at the<br>prostate<br>but the symptoms uh don't quite follow<br>the vph as we've said and this is a<br>graph of symptoms and age and we can see<br>that basically by the time you're in<br>your 70s about 50% of men will have<br>either moderate or severe lower urinary<br>tract symptoms and a proportion of those<br>will be due to<br>BPH and this is just to show you that we<br>don't always reach for the uh you know<br>Surgical Solutions when we're faced with<br>these men with lower urin tract symptoms<br>uh we're often offering education and<br>lifestyle advice and of course uh the<br>inevitable drugs there's a range of<br>drugs that we use uh the ones at the top<br>you might use if you have a lot of<br>irritation and then you you might have<br>uh the ones at the bottom you might use<br>if you're having uh problems with um<br>storage but um you there's a range of<br>different solutions and it doesn't<br>always involve surgery but I was<br>interested in surgery so let's talk a<br>little bit about the surgical options<br>this is a uh schematic from a good<br>friend of mine who's now deceased John<br>Fitzpatrick and uh this is the operation<br>which really defined Urology back in the<br>early days this is what's called the<br>open prostectomy now if you can imagine<br>that the patient's feet are towards the<br>top and the head is towards the bottom<br>and we're looking down into the pelvis<br>and that's the bladder and the prostate<br>and so what we do is we open up the<br>front of the prostate and we've got<br>Russell mckoy here who done more of<br>these than you can shake a stick at and<br>uh well I won't get you to talk today<br>Russell<br>um and what we do then is we uh open up<br>the space between the BPH tissue and it<br>sort of forms sort of a benign tumor<br>it's a sort of encapsulated growth it's<br>a prostate within the prostate if you<br>like and so you get in there with the<br>index finger and scoop the prostate<br>out uh or the BPH tissue out and then<br>you control the bleeding and uh sew the<br>thing up and uh this served urologist<br>well for many<br>years uh but it does come at a bit of a<br>price there's a as a 25% transfusion<br>rate there's a 5 to 7 Day Hospital stay<br>in most series and it's a reasonably<br>major sort of thing so urologists moved<br>on to uh endoscopic techniques 70 odd<br>years ago and this is the the the bog<br>standard operation that urologists do<br>for smaller prostates uh for BPH and<br>this is the so-called turp and in this<br>you can see that we remove small<br>fragments of the prostate and uh so<br>prostate chips if you like and this is<br>the BPH tissue and then they are placed<br>back in the bladder and then we could<br>once we've scooped out a channel in the<br>through the prostate then we flush these<br>fragments out and it gives us a wide<br>open Channel and usually the patient can<br>have the catheter out in a couple of<br>days and head off<br>home so this is the environment that we<br>uh were faced with in the late 80s and<br>early 90s and then arrived lasers lasers<br>are really what I've been interested in<br>as far as BPH is concerned uh for the<br>last 20 odd years the original laser<br>procedure which was uh pioneered by my<br>friend and Mentor Tony Costello Who's<br>professor of surgery at the University<br>of Melbourne he first published an<br>operation involving a wavelength called<br>nimium yag indd yag which you'll see the<br>second bar on the left there and the IND<br>yag laser penetrated quite deeply into<br>the prostate if you look at that uh on<br>on the right side there we can see that<br>uh we're down around this sort of range<br>because the prostate is mainly 70 or 80<br>% water so this is the this is the<br>absorption if you like the laser we use<br>by the way is this one here where the<br>penetration is only a millimeter or two<br>but it penetrated quite deeply and what<br>he did with us using a side fire fiber<br>he sort of cooked the prostate from the<br>inside and he might have done four Burns<br>if you like circumferentially to the<br>prostate and maybe did that twice the<br>whole thing would only take a minute per<br>burn and so the paent might have only<br>been in theater for 5 10 minutes and<br>then uh away they go and that was fine<br>they often went home the next day but uh<br>it did take a month or six weeks before<br>they uh really started to feel any<br>better and often they were quite<br>miserable uh throughout this experience<br>and that was the so-called VAP<br>procedure so we had the<br>fortunate uh uh circumstance that uh a<br>mutual friend of ours this is myself and<br>Mark um by the name of Mike Peterson who<br>was uh who is a distributor a local<br>distributor of medical products here in<br>Oakland he had a relationship with a<br>large laser company in Silicon Valley<br>called uh coherent and coherent medical<br>just happened to be the world's largest<br>laser company and most of<br>their uh lasers were for light shows and<br>for industrial uses and so forth and<br>they just started to make a 4A into<br>surgical uh Endeavors and they'd had<br>great success with the CO2 laser for<br>skin and that was Mike's main interest<br>but uh they developed this laser called<br>aium laser which they uh uh had<br>developed and we we bought the first one<br>they ever sold so we had a high-powered<br>holum laser and a neodimium laser in the<br>same box and basically we used the<br>neodium laser to cook the prostate and<br>then used theumer because it didn't<br>penetrate very deeply to actually make a<br>channel and that allowed the patients to<br>recover a lot quicker but it was still<br>pretty inefficient and time<br>consuming so that's this procedure then<br>evolved to a procedure analogous to the<br>turp where you just chopped out little<br>fragments and we called that holum laser<br>reection of the prostate and that's the<br>next technique that we uh uh evolved and<br>that really uh that really caught on<br>uh around the world there a lot of<br>people who were interested in laser<br>moved from the vlap procedure to this<br>procedure which was theum laser<br>reection and uh it was still a bit uh<br>tedious and a bit inefficient compared<br>to uh turp but it was actually better<br>for the patient uh in terms of their<br>perioperative or the time and time<br>around the uh operation U but it did<br>really uh cement the holum laser as a<br>viable<br>wavelength and around this time we were<br>developing a relationship with some of<br>the big instrument uh surgical<br>instrument makers and two of the German<br>companies storts and Olympus started<br>developing<br>prototype uh instruments for us to allow<br>us to do this procedure because it did<br>require uh uh slightly different uh<br>tools so we developed this relationship<br>as well all fac a lot of it was<br>facilitated by coherent who were was<br>good to be associated with in those<br>early<br>days so my NE my next salutary<br>experience would be to say that we we<br>had new technology we had innovative<br>ideas and we had backing of a large<br>American corporates but randomized<br>control trials are really the lifeblood<br>of medical<br>Technologies and so we had to start<br>producing the science to actually make<br>any sort of meaningful Headway with the<br>laser techniques that we were<br>pioneering and uh my immutable law from<br>this was basically the quality research<br>uh is is essential if you want to carve<br>out an academic career and the<br>randomized control trial uh for the<br>medical devices is the way forward so<br>the first randomized control trial that<br>we did was comparing our rection<br>technique to the VAP which was the<br>standard laser technique that was used<br>in the early 90s<br>and we pretty much showed that in every<br>respect other than the actual time they<br>spent in the operating room it was<br>Superior and uh we showed that even in<br>terms of the the blockage the relief of<br>the blockage that the patients had um<br>that the that theum reection was better<br>than the vet and this was an important<br>first step for us the next randomized<br>control trial we did uh compared the<br>holum reection versus the tur<br>which was the standard procedure and<br>still is the predominant procedure<br>worldwide that that in many<br>jurisdictions that's changing and this<br>also was the FDA study for this home mum<br>laser it's it wouldn't happen now<br>because uh now the FDA to get a 510k<br>approval you need at least 50% of the<br>patients to be done in the Continental<br>us but this study was entirely done in<br>Tanga uh these were all patients who had<br>blockages and uh we basically showed<br>that it was identical to TP in terms of<br>the uh effects but uh the patients did<br>much better around the time of<br>surgery but while we were doing that of<br>course we were rediscovering the<br>prostate anatomy the old nucleation that<br>we were talking about it occurred to us<br>that it was much more efficient to<br>remove these whole loes intact and we<br>were starting to see the surgical planes<br>endoscopically and if we have a look<br>what we then started doing rather than<br>chopping these loes this is looking down<br>this is a bladder eye bladder's eye view<br>of the prostate and if we're looking<br>down towards the prostate we might see<br>uh two or three lobes to the prostate<br>and what we then moved on to was to<br>remove the whole prostatic lobe by<br>getting into this what's called a<br>surgical plane that we knew from our<br>open prostectomy experience and we were<br>trying to enucleate just like you did<br>with the index finger with the old open<br>prostatectomy and this is a procedure<br>that we termed holum laser a nucleation<br>of the prostate and we first described<br>1998 and this is what you see when<br>you're doing aium nucleation this is the<br>BPH tissue here here and here and you<br>can see this is the capsule of the<br>prostate which is the compressed<br>prostate and we're finding our way into<br>this plane and the the lobe peels away<br>from the capsule and this becomes a very<br>efficient way of getting rid of this<br>tissue and I'll just show you the short<br>video just to show you this plane<br>because uh the plane itself when you see<br>it you can see how obvious it becomes<br>this whole enucleation thing that was we<br>were looking into the bladder there and<br>now we're making an incision into the<br>prostate and now we're the lobe the the<br>lateral lobe is<br>here and we're moving down and this is<br>the plane between the compressed<br>prostate and the adenoma and you see how<br>it peels see that<br>nucleation uh and this is the plane that<br>we're in when we do H and<br>nucleation and uh this was a bit of a<br>revelation uh to the uh uh Urology World<br>though it did take a long time before uh<br>people really started to become<br>interested in it but this is uh<br>basically the left lateral lobe of the<br>patient and what we're doing is we're in<br>the plane here again and the laser<br>really it it provides a bit of cutting<br>but it's really there just to quize<br>those little bleeders and you can see it<br>just peeling away so this is the whole<br>enucleation concept and this is what you<br>might have done with your index finger<br>when you were uh doing an open<br>prostatectomy<br>so then we had a problem we had big<br>chunks of prostate sometimes as big as<br>your fist sitting in the bladder we had<br>to develop a way to get those fragments<br>out so we started humbly and this thing<br>top left is an arthoscopic shaver and so<br>this is something that an orthopod and I<br>know Sue STS here um an orthopod might<br>use in a knee you put it in the knee and<br>it nibbles away at the cartilage well we<br>put it through the tummy and nibbled<br>away at bits of prostate in the bladder<br>uh it was a bit of a messy business<br>because there was quite a lot of leakage<br>around the canular and so forth but uh<br>that's how we started and then we<br>convinced uh the company we were working<br>with luminus based in pelto uh to um<br>produce for us a morcellator and this is<br>the hand piece these are the<br>reciprocating blades so it sort of uh<br>the blades sort of reciprocate and then<br>with the high paed suction suck the<br>fragments out and this is the motor and<br>the Hand piece and this is the<br>controller blocks which controled the<br>motor and there's a foot pedal of course<br>which controls all this we also uh<br>formed an alliance with an ockland<br>company to produce a Pneumatic one which<br>would plug into the uh to the compressed<br>air so we were using all these good<br>Orthopedic props so and um this was a<br>little bit jerky though it didn't really<br>hold the fragments too well and this uh<br>was quite a bit smoother so we went with<br>uh this design and with the company that<br>that uh manufactured the laser though<br>they were a little bit out of their<br>comfort zone with these Mechanical<br>Devices interestingly uh a few years<br>later we came across the patent for this<br>device and uh um unsurprisingly uh we<br>weren't listed on the patent even though<br>it was our idea and we developed and of<br>course there wasn't wasn't a royalty to<br>be seen as you would expect uh and the<br>the the engineers that we were working<br>with were all featured last in this and<br>uh at this point my commercial partner<br>Mark he threw his toys out of the cotton<br>said he wasn't going to able to work<br>with them ever again and he never did<br>and but I sold it<br>on so this is the commercial morat that<br>coherent developed uh from that that one<br>that you saw before and this was the one<br>that they produced in uh 1998 and this<br>is the high padum<br>laser and this is the uh this is the<br>modern uh morat which we use we still<br>use the coherent one but we use this<br>other one and and there's probably four<br>or five of these in the market now which<br>have uh been spawned directly by the hom<br>the nucleation<br>procedure so then we went on to<br>study the enucleation procedure so holp<br>compared to turp we started off working<br>with and funded by the laser company but<br>as soon as they realized they didn't<br>need this for FDA approval of the mors<br>lator they dropped us like a hot cake<br>and we had to we carried on and we<br>self-funded this procedure with uh our<br>Otten gains from pharmaceutical trials<br>and uh and that's a model for funding<br>that uh that uh you know you always need<br>to consider uh for surgical device<br>trials because they're notoriously<br>poorly funded but anyway we studied it<br>versus turp and looked at the durability<br>at seven<br>years and so did many other people so we<br>did the first randomized controlled<br>trial comparing home nucleation to turp<br>but uh there are now at least 10<br>randomized control trials at the<br>literature confirming our original<br>findings which were that the procedure<br>was more efficient that it was less<br>morbid you got rid of more tissue and it<br>gave a better relief of the blockage<br>than turp and it was more fun to do and<br>more cost<br>effective we carried on studying this<br>thing uh we looked at large prostates we<br>did a a couple more randomized trials<br>looking at small prostates looking at<br>other energy sources so the randomized<br>control trial has been very good to me<br>over the<br>years and if you look now in the<br>literature you'll find over 500 papers<br>on uh home and nucleation and every<br>conceivable patient subgroup has been<br>studied and the randomized control<br>trials comparing HP with all manner of<br>other things still keep coming<br>through and it's very well studied to<br>the point that it's now and all the got<br>guidelines and and all the textbooks uh<br>in urology and it uh has been called by<br>many authors uh the new gold standard<br>for the treatment of uh<br>BPH and that's an American publication<br>Indian and Canadian publication and um<br>and this of course uh all came from our<br>endeavors in Tanga and you if you look<br>at the current inventory of laser<br>techniques in the<br>prostate and once again vaporization and<br>we developed holum ablation reection we<br>developed helium reection and nucleation<br>we developed holp and these were the<br>first in each of the classes and all<br>these others are basically uh uh um well<br>they're not cheap knockoffs but they are<br>knockoffs but uh some of them are okay<br>but essentially apart from PvP which<br>we'll see there on the which is the<br>Greenlight laser on the vaporization<br>front I think that's a better vaporizer<br>than holap there is no better Rector or<br>nucleator in my<br>view so the first the next salutary<br>experience and my wife my longsuffering<br>wife Judy is in the audience you do have<br>to do the hard yards you do have to go<br>to the international meetings sit on the<br>advisory panels do the workshops uh go<br>to the meetings be do the visiting<br>Professor things if you want to succeed<br>in academic medicine visibility is very<br>important and you do need to publish you<br>don't actually perish if you don't<br>publish but you don't do particularly<br>well so that's enough of lasers I'd just<br>like to give you a little brief incling<br>of the research that we're currently<br>doing uh in BPH and that's probably over<br>half the Publications that I've done are<br>BPH related we've looked at uh<br>medication we've been involved in<br>multicenter uh studies we've looked at<br>prostatic injections these are enzymatic<br>uh substances which shrink the prostate<br>uh we're currently trialing a different<br>sort of laser for a nucleation<br>um we're looking at uh stance we've<br>looked at biodegradable stance in the<br>past uh and we're looking now at some<br>permanent stance on the back of some<br>success that uh other companies have had<br>with uh implantable devices for BPH and<br>the one I'm most interested in is the<br>waterjet technology this is called<br>aquablation and this is where we use uh<br>water a water blaster in the prostate<br>essentially and we're we've linked up<br>with another uh silicon V startup to do<br>this which does involve a lot of the<br>Heavy Hitters in the medical device<br>world and they support this research and<br>I'd like to mention that just briefly<br>this is the stent that we're looking at<br>and this can be done in an outpatient<br>environment through a flexible telescope<br>and uh we place this little three-<br>layered stent in the prostate and uh<br>essentially patients who wouldn't be fit<br>for surgery might well be treated<br>treated this way as a standard and uh be<br>they would wouldn't have to keep a<br>catheter but without the risks of<br>anesthesia but anyway moving on to uh<br>the aquablation now water Jets have been<br>used uh a lot in<br>Industry um and when you use water jets<br>in air you're using quite High pressures<br>up to 990,000<br>psi and you can use it on metal Stone<br>and wood uh um and um there's a range of<br>uses but we're interested in submerged<br>water jets and of course there hasn't<br>been much done on submerged water jets<br>there's the non-cavitating type which<br>might be what you might find in your<br>Spar pool and fortunately that doesn't<br>cause you any harm but cavitating when<br>the pressures get up um they are they<br>can be quite destructive in an aquous<br>environment uh you do use lesser<br>pressures uh 50 to 500 to 10,000 PSI the<br>m maximum our device goes up to about<br>85,000 PSI and uh that really uh for the<br>prostate and for the depth that we need<br>uh is is is what we need for developing<br>a channel in the prostate<br>gland it does use robotics uh and once<br>again Robotics are going to replace a<br>lot of our jobs in the future and this<br>is probably an inkling there's at least<br>a half a dozen urologists in the<br>audience and this is an example how of<br>how robotics might be replacing your<br>jobs in the future but most of us won<br>won't be caring will we but this is uh<br>this is the um uh the robotic component<br>there's a couple of micr Motors in the<br>hand piece one that controls rotation<br>and one that controls longitudinal<br>extension and retraction and this moves<br>the water jet from side to side and from<br>front to back and then we use this very<br>precise high pressure pump which very<br>accurately delivers U pressures up to<br>10,000 000 PSI and there's a another<br>motor for active aspiration the actual<br>so-called aquab beam comes through a<br>sapphire nozzle which is only 150 Micron<br>in diameter so it's only the size of a<br>human hair but 150 microns Sapphire is<br>used because it's very accurate it<br>doesn't expand or contract so if you<br>deliver a certain flow rate to that all<br>other things being equal it will always<br>deliver the same um um water flow and<br>essentially if you can control the flow<br>rate very accurately you can actually<br>Destruction and this is what the water<br>jet looks like when it's attacking a<br>piece of liver and um you can see when<br>we slow up you can see that the tissue<br>close to the water jet is destroyed<br>completely and the further away you get<br>for it the tissue is denatured but not<br>necessarily destroyed and obviously the<br>flow can affects the destruction so<br>on the touch screen you can turn up the<br>flow and that deepens the level of<br>Destruction and of course this can be<br>urethra there is very little<br>penetration into the tissue itself uh at<br>the limits of the distraction so you do<br>have to still control the bleeding at<br>it but here I'll show you a quick<br>animation which shows the procedure you<br>you place the hand piece the hand piece<br>is disposable you attach the motor pack<br>which has got those two little uh Motors<br>in<br>it and then um using the touchcreen<br>you've got a transrectal ultrasound<br>probe in there which is uh the Imaging<br>and then the technology marries up the<br>uh device and you uh line up the device<br>in relation to the ultrasound and it's<br>all touchscreen stuff and I can tell you<br>Engineers do that better than urologists<br>by and large but uh the urologists still<br>have to come in at the end and control<br>the bleeding but typically it only takes<br>one pass of this and it can penetrate up<br>to 7 cm in depth and so it basically<br>takes out a channel in the prostate uh<br>quite simply it takes about three or<br>four minutes and then uh the job is done<br>in prostates we're testing up to uh 80<br>grams in size which is about three times<br>the normal<br>size and so we reported the first and<br>man cases of aquablation earlier this<br>year and I'm one of the two principal<br>investigators from the water<br>trial uh which is involves 20 sites<br>around the US and two in austral Asia<br>ourselves and interestingly uh Tony<br>Costello's group in um in Melbourne and<br>it's another randomized control<br>trial so thank you all for coming and uh<br>my wife and my three sons uh my three<br>sons couldn't be here because they were<br>too lazy but uh no but they don't live<br>in Oakland so that's their excuse so<br>thank you and it's a great honor to be a<br>new professor at the University of<br>you thank you very much Peter what a<br>remarkable<br>career and uh to think that you've<br>produced all of that at in Bay of Plenty<br>with it seems really minimal support<br>from outside is truly remarkable and it<br>demonstrates some of your<br>characteristics perseverance is clearly<br>one of them you start with being knocked<br>back again and again in terms of<br>research you you you start some basic<br>science and you don't stop Des despite<br>failing if you like and you you innovate<br>so you I would have thought once you'd<br>made one of those steps that might have<br>been enough to think we've we've got<br>there but it's never enough it sounds<br>like and now we've got the the water jet<br>uh<br>technique<br>um I I just have to take my hat off to<br>you and the way you do<br>it your innovation has not just been in<br>in your research your Innovation<br>obviously is in the way you work with<br>others most people who are inv involved<br>in such a dramatic number of randomized<br>controlled trials are in a very big<br>group and they have research students<br>who work with them for years and you've<br>generated that by your own hard work and<br>particularly your<br>organization and that's that's<br>clearly uh showed your leadership in<br>taking taking that forward the other key<br>thing that that speaks to me is your<br>ability to build<br>relationships and to maintain them<br>even when in a sense you're not<br>recognized when you ought to be you<br>continue to put put in the hard yards<br>and in a sense forgive what's<br>happened and keep going for the sake of<br>producing a better result for your<br>patients so it's been it's been<br>wonderful here tonight hearing you say<br>these things and hearing the journey<br>much of it is completely new to me I've<br>learned a lot about Urology<br>um for a while I was a urologist but the<br>M the main operation I did was the one<br>with your<br>finger um so to see now that we can do<br>with water that's<br>amazing um two years ago I was in Nepal<br>and went to one of their Urology<br>meetings and two or three of the<br>surgeons came up to me and they said do<br>you know Peter<br>Gilling and I was able to put out my<br>chest and say he's in my department and<br>my reputation went up like<br>that so Peter thank you you<br>congratulations it's been wonderful<br>hearing this it's a great example of<br>persever perseverance Innovation<br>relationship building and including<br>other people so thank you come forward<br>tonight<br>wow wonderful Peter what a fantastic<br>lecture I think all the men in the<br>audience can now uncross their<br>legs uh that was an eye opener and I<br>think it's a testament to your as I was<br>saying your perseverance and your<br>dedication to Discovery and inovation uh<br>while at the same time always<br>considering uh seeking new and improved<br>ways for patients is the sort of<br>uh work that this University<br>acknowledges and recognizes as being fit<br>for a professor at the University of<br>Oakland so once again congratulations on<br>your election to the prophet it and<br>thank you all for coming tonight just to<br>remind you that the last of our three<br>inaugural lectures uh Professor Janie<br>Sheridan is on Thursday night Jan is<br>from the School of Pharmacy so thank you<br>all again for coming thank you Alan and<br>I and<br>especially thank you Peter for a<br>wonderful<br>leip</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
