to<br>welcome you here tonight my name is<br>Helen Nicholson and I'm the deputy Vice<br>Chancellor external engagement at the<br>University of<br>atar and I'd like to thank you for<br>coming and I'd especially like to um<br>thank the minister Minister Woodhouse<br>for for letting us come here and um<br>hosting us tonight in Parliament<br>buildings the 2016 series is um<br>presented an association with the health<br>research Council of New Zealand as it<br>celebrates its 25th anniversary and I'd<br>like to take this opportunity to welcome<br>our guests this evening from the hlc um<br>and I know Conway Pal's here and also<br>Jerome da and Susan snively who've<br>supported us during this<br>series The University of atago has had a<br>long association with the health<br>research Council and many significant<br>research projects have benefited from<br>funding received from the HRC and this<br>has enabled um at taro's Health<br>researchers to take even greater steps<br>in their research Endeavors and I just<br>like to share with you a couple of the<br>things or a few of the things most<br>recent examples where we've benefited<br>from HRC<br>funding so one relates to um Christ<br>Church so a t taro's Christ Church<br>Research heart um Institute has been at<br>the Forefront of Global Research into<br>heart disease diagnostics for about 30<br>years and it's recently developed a test<br>to quickly and easily detect unstable<br>angina and it does this by measuring<br>levels of the hormone um BNP signal<br>peptide in a patient's blood and this um<br>test is being commercialized through a<br>newly formed company called Upstream<br>medical<br>Technologies meanwhile in Wellington hea<br>Ora housing and health research program<br>researchers are running six trials to<br>lift housing standards to improve<br>Children's Health this includes<br>insulating and warming 600 newborns<br>homes in Hut Valley in wua Mata and<br>providing wraparound housing and Welfare<br>Services to 800 children hospitalized in<br>The Wider Wellington<br>region and then back in denan more<br>recently researched from the denon's<br>multidisciplinary health and<br>longitudinal study has found that it's<br>possible to detect differences in<br>people's aging rates even in young<br>adults<br>and this leads to the possibility of<br>offering prevention opportunities before<br>chronic diseases become<br>established now there's one person um of<br>our one member of our atago academic<br>Community who I haven't mentioned yet<br>and that's Professor Greg Cook and I'd<br>like to invite The Honorable Michael<br>Woodhouse um one of our denan MPS and<br>the University of atago alumnus to<br>lecture<br>uh thank you Helen C everybody uh<br>welcome back to Parliament to those<br>familiar faces uh whom I've seen and to<br>those of you who are here for the first<br>time uh welcome to what is I think<br>lecture five of the 2016 University of<br>otago lecture series uh a series that I<br>have been<br>extremely privileged and proud to host<br>firstly as Helen says as a denan based<br>uh Member of Parliament as a member of<br>the cabinet that is responsible for<br>appropriating much of the funding<br>through the HRC and directly to the<br>university and and through other means<br>that gave<br>gives uh substance to many of the<br>fascinating bodies of research that are<br>going on including this one but of<br>course as Helen said also as a Prof<br>proud alumnist of the University of<br>otago I guess I have something of a uh<br>historical uh interest in this as some<br>of you know I was in the health sector<br>for a long time although not in a<br>clinical setting um the issue of<br>antimicrobial resistance and pathogen<br>management more generally is a very very<br>live one it has Global<br>interest the the issue of um<br>specifically MRSA and and resistance<br>strains of of uh<br>bacteria the most<br>recent example of good primary<br>management and and prevention strategies<br>in havlock north for example where we<br>are having to cope with a very nasty<br>outbreak of uh what's most likely to be<br>campy<br>labea uh through the water system sheets<br>home I think how important it is that we<br>continue to research ways in which to<br>keep our population safe before I<br>introduce Professor cook can I again<br>apologize we are in the middle of a very<br>busy parliamentary session and I'm<br>progressing a rather controversial Bill<br>through the house as we speak it's the<br>dinner break but I do need to go and do<br>some horse trading with the other<br>parties uh therefore while I'll be<br>listening to most of the speech it will<br>be necessary for me to depart before the<br>end so it'll I'll leave it to Helen to<br>wind up and I'm afraid tonight I won't<br>be able to join you for Refreshments<br>which I those of you who know uh will be<br>served in in the East wing and those of<br>you who don't just follow the ones who<br>do so tonight's fifth lecture is to be<br>presented by Professor Greg Cook<br>Professor cook is a microbiologist at a<br>tago microbiology and Immunology<br>Department another of our fantastic<br>departments since starting at the<br>University in 1998 he has mentored and<br>trained over 50 postgraduate students<br>who are our new generation of scientists<br>at the dawning of their careers in 2014<br>Professor cook was awarded the<br>University of otago's highest research<br>honor the distinguish wished research<br>medal for his lab's pioneering work<br>which led to breakthroughs and<br>developing more effective drug<br>treatments for<br>tuberculosis currently Professor Cook's<br>work is focused on bacterial physiology<br>and an antimicrobial resistance with the<br>goal of This research being the<br>production of a new class of antibiotics<br>and we may well need them very soon<br>termed metabiotics that specifically<br>Target the metabolism of<br>microorganisms his lecture is entitled<br>The race against antimicrobial<br>resistance can we win and it'll discuss<br>for us the battle against antimicrobial<br>resistance which threatens to return us<br>to the pre-antibiotic era and that is<br>something of a nightmare scen scenario I<br>would suggest as well as how his<br>research is developing new weapons to<br>fight its Global spread ladies and<br>Cook I just want to um thank you Michael<br>for that kind introduction and I also<br>want to thank the University of Oto for<br>giving me the opportunity and come here<br>and talk tonight so this is the question<br>that I've posed to you um can we win<br>this race against um antibiotic<br>resistance so if you ask people what was<br>the greatest discovery of the 20th<br>century most people will tell you it was<br>this discovery of antibiotics and of<br>course we all know antibiotics were<br>discovered by um sir Alexander Fleming<br>and it's been estimated by the World<br>Health Organization that um antibiotics<br>on average add 20 years to each of our<br>lives so very very important Discovery<br>antibiotics were so effective when they<br>were first introduced to treat um<br>bacterial pathogens that the US Surgeon<br>General and actually this was the year I<br>was born 1966 he actually believed it<br>was possible um that we'd be a to close<br>the book on infectious disease that's<br>how effective antibiotics<br>were so then you start to see headings<br>like this bad bugs no drugs and so you<br>start to wonder well actually what went<br>wrong in in 50<br>years uh well what went wrong is that we<br>treated<br>antibiotics and used them for many many<br>things and we actually the amount of<br>antibiotics that we've used in our<br>hospitals and agriculture is a<br>staggering amount and in actually fact<br>various surveys have shown in the last<br>10 years there's been a 36 in 36%<br>increase globally in the use of<br>antimicrobials in country like India we'<br>seen a 62% increase equivalent to 13<br>billion units of antibiotics being you<br>know released so these are not only<br>being used in agriculture they're also<br>being used in<br>hospitals so what happened was soon as<br>we introduced penicillin of course we<br>had antibiotic resistance to that<br>antibiotic and so we used to think about<br>bacteria becoming resistant to single<br>antibiotics but now we've got bacteria<br>evolv Ving to multi-drug resistance and<br>so MRSA is an example of that we're<br>going to have something called xdr right<br>so these are strains of bacteria that<br>that are extensively drug resistant so<br>an organism that I work on called<br>tuberculosis this organism has become<br>resistant to 10 different antimicrobials<br>and for tuberculosis we now have totally<br>drug resistant strains now a point that<br>I really want to make here is that not<br>all bacteria become resistant to<br>antibiotics so for many bacteria and an<br>example of cus pyogenes that causes<br>strep throat this bacterium has never<br>become resistant to penicillin and we<br>have no idea why right so we're not<br>talking about every bacterium becoming<br>resistant to antibiotics we're talking<br>about particular<br>bacteria right so that's the first point<br>that I really want to make so we so we<br>underestimated this ability of bacteria<br>to become<br>resistant antibiotic resistance is very<br>expensive about $30 billion a year is<br>spent on trying to control outbreaks<br>caused by antibiotic resistance<br>resistant bacteria in the US 23,000<br>deaths per year and greater than 2<br>million illnesses so antibiotic<br>resistance costs us a lot of money and<br>if we look at the numbers going forward<br>this this number starts to go up<br>massively we've been complacent right<br>and I'll tell you why we've been<br>complacent on developing new drugs and<br>so when you see headlines like this you<br>start to see other headlines like this<br>that people are now saying that<br>antibiotic resistance is a is a threat<br>you know could be equivalent to global<br>warming right so we need to be thinking<br>about that in terms of which organisms<br>are we really talking about here clearly<br>we're not talking about all bacterial<br>pathogens but obviously we must be<br>talking about some so the bacterium I<br>work on is this bacterium called micob<br>bacterium tuberculosis right I'm sorry<br>how this this came off here so Robert<br> discovered this organism about 125<br>years ago but in actual fact micrium<br>tuberculosis has been around for about<br>30,000 years right and this this<br>organism has existed in a metastable<br>equilibrium with us for 30,000 years so<br>we never eradicated TB and TB has never<br>eradicated us right but this equilibrium<br>is clearly changing and things that<br>change this equilibrium are things like<br>HIV right so this appeared on the cover<br>of Time Magazine right and it's called<br>contagion and what this article was<br>about was about this bacterium here so<br>in 2006 we had a brain of TB evolve<br>called extensively drug resistant TB so<br>this organism evolved at the epicenter<br>of the HIV AIDS epidemic right so TB<br>right so HIV of the of the many many<br>people that have HIV on this planet TB<br>kills a 30% of them so HIV individuals<br>are very susceptible to<br>tuberculosis right and and really HIV<br>was the trigger point for the Resurgence<br>of TB right we thought we'd White TV out<br>in the 1960s 1970s and then came HIV and<br>so what that meant was more drugs were<br>needed to control TB in these imuno<br>compromised individuals and so it was<br>probably no surprise that extensively<br>drug resistant TB evolved at this<br>epicenter this organism was deadly 52 of<br>the 53 infected individuals were dead in<br>16 days if you're HIV positive and you<br>get extensively drug resistant TB you're<br>life expectancy is about 2<br>weeks right for drug resistant TB we<br>need we need to treat you for 24 months<br>so before we can even diagnose it right<br>you're dead this is a very very<br>dangerous organism right and it's now<br>spread to greater than 100 countries now<br>you're thinking here tonight oh come on<br>he's talking about countries like Africa<br>China you know Asia that's never going<br>to happen in New Zealand well in actual<br>fact we had our first extensively drug<br>resistant isol of TB in Denon Hospital<br>2010 you're probably thinking well how<br>does that happen we don't really have a<br>big problem with TB right we have about<br>one case of TB a day and certainly drug<br>resistant TB we have drug resistant TB<br>but it's not a huge problem so the key<br>point that I want to make to you is that<br>drug resistant TB is a shared health<br>problem right we can't sit in New<br>Zealand and ignore what's going on<br>globally and the reason is that this<br>person that had this extensive drug was<br>this nice it was the student<br>studying at the University ofo he<br>arrived in New Zealand with a latent<br>infection so obviously it wasn't<br>detected even though it had chest XR and<br>he reactivated it took 66 days to<br>diagnose this student with xdr TB so<br>that's the big problem for New Zealand<br>we're a low incidence country we don't<br>have technology to be able to diagnose<br>xdt we just simply haven't seen enough<br>of this disease The Strain was resistant<br>to about 8 different antibiotics it took<br>nine drugs to to treat them he had to<br>take those drugs for for 18 months cost<br>of taxpayer<br>$180,000 right the good thing here is<br>that he lived right if we deported him<br>back to myamar he would have died right<br>and he's still living in New<br>Zealand right so HRC recognized this<br>that we need to be part of this Global<br>fight so they introduce this thing here<br>called The easia Joint research program<br>so my lab was one of the first labs in<br>New Zealand to get one of these grants<br>and what we did is we partnered with<br>myamar so myamar right they have 650<br>cases of TB a day right they are high<br>incidence country drug resistance is<br>spiraling out of control right so we<br>started this program with them and so<br>one really cool thing about that is I<br>get to go on road trips with my vice<br>Chancellor and my DVC International so<br>Halen and Harley and I we went to<br>Myanmar and we actually met with the new<br>president of Myanmar the lady so we met<br>the highest person in the country to<br>talk about the research efforts that<br>we're going to do in this country a<br>postoral fellow in my lab by the name of<br>Tong runs this program so it's not about<br>white guys in New Zealand telling people<br>in Myanmar how to do research we<br>actually have we want to train the<br>people in Myanmar to do this research<br>right they have to take control of the<br>problem but we want to help them right<br>so that's a great program it's up and<br>running and it's looking very successful<br>and what we wanted to be able to do is<br>to be try and get better diagnostics for<br>this organism so we can identify who's<br>got the<br>disease so antibiotic resistance is<br>obviously a problem otherwise I wouldn't<br>be here talking so a guy by the name of<br>Jim O'Neal is an economist has released<br>these recent reports and what he<br>basically predicts if we don't do<br>anything about antimicrobial resistance<br>this is how many people are going to die<br>in the year 2050 of AMR 10 million<br>people right what I can tell you for TB<br>1 A2 million people die of tuberculosis<br>a year of that 1 and a half million<br>people 200,000 are killed by drug<br>resistant<br>strains what is this going to cost well<br>it's going to have a massive cost in<br>terms of GDP right so very expensive a<br>lot of people are going to die and so<br>what Jim O'Neal is saying is that we<br>should be moving to a system where that<br>when you go and see a doctor you do not<br>get an antibiotic until we diagnose you<br>with a bacterial in<br>infection right so that's what he's<br>saying he's basically saying we've got<br>to stop handing out antibiotics like<br>sweets I think he's taking this a bit<br>too far unless we can prove that the<br>infection is bacterial so for example TB<br>it took us 66 days to diagnose this guy<br>with xdr TB what do we do do we wait 66<br>days before we give him drugs I mean<br>these are the issues that we Face going<br>forward right so this is a bit of a<br>problem so everyone will point the<br>finger at antibiotic use in animals<br>right and I've got to be honest with you<br>10 years ago I was one of those people I<br>was In This Very Room 10 years ago<br>trying to convince the Poulter industry<br>Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to<br>stop using antibiotics in chicken<br>production right and Sue kley was my<br>partner in crime and it's safe to say<br>that we got absolutely nowhere right so<br>I actually 10 years ago I gave up on<br>this area of research<br>right I couldn't get any funding and it<br>just couldn't get any buying so I walked<br>away from it and that's when I started<br>working on<br>TB right so this is this is what happens<br>right if we look at antibiotic use in<br>the US 70% of all antibiotic use is in<br>animals 30% is consumed by humans right<br>so of all the antibiotics we're using<br>70% is flowing into animal production so<br>let's think about this for second<br>animals get sick just like we do so they<br>also demand the theoric putic use of<br>antimicrob<br>what I'm talking about is sub therpeutic<br>submic prophylactic use right growth<br>promotion that's where there are issues<br>right it's not so simple so here's<br>here's the important thing right so of<br>the antibiotics that we use in animals<br>31 are deemed medically important right<br>so we've got these 10 here these 10<br>antibiotics are currently not deemed<br>medically important the problem that<br>we've got because we've got so much<br>resistance these anti antibiotics right<br>here are going to become important to us<br>going forward and one of those<br>antibiotics on there is Bacitracin which<br>is an antibiotic that we work on right<br>anti Basra is not really used in humans<br>it's used as topical agents but it's not<br>used extensively but people are now<br>saying we're going to have to start<br>using this antibiotic because we're<br>running out of antibiotics for some<br>organisms right so this is the scenario<br>in the<br>US right so this was uh Sue kley and I<br>getting in trouble right because<br>obviously we went after the the poultry<br>production because of the antibiotics<br>being used there I think there was about<br>86,000 kgs of antibiotics a year used in<br>animals right and then so you see sort<br>of stuff like this super bugs found in<br>chicken dangerous and we're Absol we're<br>massive consumers of chicken 85 to 100<br>million per year right so in order to<br>have this density of farming you need<br>antimicrobials right because if one of<br>these chickens gets sick the whole flock<br>get wiped out in days right and these<br>antibiotics are for particular things<br>and particular conditions interestingly<br>in some countries in Europe they've<br>completely banned the use of<br>antimicrobials and animal<br>production right so this is what I came<br>I came to Parliament I stood right here<br>poltry industry sitting right there<br>holding hands with math everybody was in<br>it together and I basically showed them<br>this data right so we collaborated with<br>the Poulter industry we looked at 147<br>Farms across New Zealand right so we<br>sampled 90% of poultry production in New<br>Zealand<br>the polter industry were absolutely<br>fantastic they were totally engaged in<br>this project right so they sent us feal<br>samples from the animals from the farm<br>so those feal samples would arrive at my<br>lab all week and then we' take those<br>feal samples and then we'd look at the<br>microbes in those in those feal samples<br>and test their resistance to antibiotics<br>and we tested the resistance to the<br>antibiotics that they were using in<br>poultry production so the antibiotics<br>they were using right so the big one was<br>Basset trce in 26,000 kgs a year right<br>these chickens they always see baset TRC<br>and some of the other antibiotics are<br>rotated so what this table shows so this<br>was the table I actually showed them<br>right so these are different suppliers<br>right so you can guess who these<br>suppliers are so these are the major<br>suppliers of poultry meat in New Zealand<br>right and what you can see here's an<br>example of Supply array so what we did<br>is we looked at 185 isolet so remember<br>this is 147 poultry farms and then of<br>those 184 iels what you can see is 183<br>at complete completely resistant to<br>basraon right so we got 99% resistance<br>to Basra so I actually said to them why<br>are you bothering to feed this<br>antibiotic because all the bacteria in<br>there are resistant earthy used to to<br>control community acquired pneumonia<br>right very high levels of resistance<br>right so this was the one I was trying<br>to get them to stop using because this<br>one here what we found was that the<br>genes for aromy resistance on the same<br>plasmid as genes encoding for<br>vamy which was actually an analog called<br>AA Parson so we used AA Parson we fed<br>this to chickens if you're resistant to<br>AA Parson you're resistant to vamy and<br>some people recognize that vamy is one<br>of the last antibiotics that we can use<br>to treat MRSA yet in this poultry we had<br>V right so we had vanis from res inro<br>cocky in poultry in New Zealand right so<br>what we wanted them to do was to stop<br>using this one cuz it was co- selecting<br>for this so even when they stopped using<br>aarson the Legacy<br>of using this antibiotic we saw that the<br>V persisted and what this means is that<br>once you get a problem with<br>resistance even if you take the drug<br>away it takes a very very long time for<br>that resistance to come down it doesn't<br>just come down overnight and so this was<br>a great example even though they'd<br>stopped using aarson the legacy of its<br>use remained in these poultry flocks and<br>we have no idea where these organisms<br>were coming from and this was about the<br>time that I basically ditched this area<br>and moved on<br>right so that was that was the issue so<br>what is the New Zealand situation right<br>so you saw 70% of all antimicrobials in<br>the US go into animal production so<br>where does New Zealand sit in this right<br>what's our what's our antibiotic use<br>look like well in actual fact New<br>Zealand is one of the lowest users of<br>antibiotics and animals in the world<br>right so that's something that we should<br>be very proud of we're number four if we<br>stopped using bass tracon we'd be number<br>one we would be be the lowest user of<br>antimicrobials in the world and animal<br>production right maybe that's something<br>we need to so this is important right<br>ratio of human to animal use so you see<br>New Zealand it's a very good number look<br>at Norway though so Norway banned all<br>antimicrobials and BR production<br>37 right so just about all of their<br>antibiotics are being used in humans<br>right so you can see New Zealand is very<br>very good but we could be number one you<br>can see some countries massive amounts<br>of antibiotics are being used in animal<br>production right so that's a very and<br>then the New Zealand veteranary<br>Association have come out and said by<br>2030 which is a really aspirational goal<br>they want to stop using antibiotics alt<br>together right very interesting goal I<br>mean hopefully they can achieve<br>it the reality of course is so we think<br>about antibiotic use in animals creates<br>antibiotic resistant organism but what<br>what impact does that have on human<br>antibiotic resistance well I can tell<br>you we don't really know<br>right what happens is we have these<br>reservoirs of antibiotic resistant<br>organisms whether we're using them in<br>animals or whether we're using them in<br>humans so this is in new this is New<br>Zealand so this is some work out of<br>denan and what they basically show is<br>that New Zealand we are excessive uses<br>of antimicrobials we have one of the<br>highest rates of prescribing in the<br>world right we use a lot of antibiotics<br>in our hospitals right so these are the<br>numbers right so this is doses daily<br>doses per thousand population you can<br>see New Zealand is right up there in<br>terms of antibiotic use you can see if<br>you compare us with countries like<br>Netherland Norway much lower right we're<br>not as bad as Greece and countries like<br>this but we have very high use of<br>antimicrobials other surveys I've seen<br>say that 63% of all antibiotic use in<br>hospitals is deemed<br>inappropriate right if you look at this<br>we're not slowing down right we<br>continuing to use more and more<br>antibiotics right and so of course this<br>creates antibiotic resist organisms just<br>like it does in any environment where<br>you use antibiotics this is some work of<br>Debbie<br>Williamson right so this is looking at<br>two topicals that you could buy over the<br>counter right so here's one called<br>banser everybody's probably got a tube<br>of this in their um Med medicine cabinet<br>home I know I've got a couple of tubes<br>that right everyone's got one of this so<br>the problem with that of course is that<br>this gets used you know it's excessive<br>use so what happens is lots and lots of<br>it gets used and then sure enough you<br>get resistance right in 2,000<br>greater than 20% of the ice that's a<br>resistant to it you might as well throw<br>it away right and you can see here in<br>about 2000 they switched to this other<br>one called fuxan right so this is fustic<br>acid and what you see is we just start<br>using lots and lots and lots and lots of<br>it right and once again 2013 greater<br>than 45% resistance M well throw it away<br>right once you get these high levels of<br>resistance then really the treatment's<br>ineffective right so we need to try and<br>stop using antibiotics excessively for<br>things they weren't really meant for for<br>and we obviously need to develop new<br>antibiotics right so the key Point here<br>is that we will never beat antibiotic<br>resistance right what we've got to try<br>and do is develop drugs quicker than the<br>organism can become resistant to it<br>right but the reason why we won't beat<br>antibiotic resistance if we don't do<br>something is that in actual fact<br>antibiotics have been around for<br>hundreds of millions of years in the<br>environment right here's a fantastic<br>study that was published in science so<br>what this group here did is they just<br>went out into the environment right<br>pristine environments that had never<br>seen<br>antibiotics sampled some bacteria from<br>the soil brought them back to the lab<br>and what you see is that look we've got<br>bacteria in the soil that have never<br>seen antibiotics that are resistant to<br>seven or eight different antibiotics and<br>the reason for that is that basically<br>just about all of our antibiotics come<br>from soil organisms right they come from<br>bacteria that live in the soils that<br>make antimicrobials to kill other<br>bacteria right that's how we discover<br>antibiotics right so this is not<br>surprising other papers are coming out<br>now showing that bacteria can actually<br>grow on<br>antibiotics right so of course it's a<br>nutrient it's got carbon nitrogen<br>hydrogen bacteria can grow on it right<br>so we should never be surprised about<br>finding resistance because obviously the<br>organisms that make these antibiotics<br>obviously already have the resistance<br>determinance in their genomes otherwise<br>they'd make an antibiotic that would<br>kill them right so all the resistance<br>determinant all the antibiotics are<br>already out there in the environment so<br>we need to think about synthetic<br>Roots right so it's not surprising that<br>there's all these resistant organism<br>antibiotics have been around for<br>millions of years vany 240 million years<br>old we've only worked out in the last 50<br>years that we can actually use it to<br>treat bacterial infections vom's a<br>fascinating one it took 30 years before<br>we saw the first resistant isolate to<br>this antibiotic 30 years right before we<br>saw resistance other antibiotics you can<br>see resistance in a year in a week right<br>this antibiotic was very unusual the<br>bacteria had to assemble a whole lot of<br>genes in order to become resistance to<br>this antibiotic bacteria grow very fast<br>so if we have one variant in the<br>population right so one cell in that<br>population is is resistant to the<br>antibiotic doubling time in 303 minutes<br>and very quickly the whole population is<br>resistant right bacteria have lots of<br>Gene transfer there's massive selection<br>press mutation frequency right there's<br>all of these factors that make it very<br>hard to comp combat<br>resistance right so everyone will say<br>okay we' got to stop using less<br>antibiotics we're going to not use as<br>many antibiotics in agriculture we're<br>not going to use as many antibiotics in<br>medicine right that's what we should be<br>doing we should just say we're not going<br>to use as much antibiotics well the<br>reality is in order to feed the planet<br>right over the next 30 Years we're<br>actually going to consume 70% more<br>antibiotics so we're not going to<br>consume less we're actually going to<br>consume more right in countries like<br>China right they're going to ma be<br>massive consumers of antibiotics going<br>forward right this is their consumption<br>in 2010 right this is what it's going to<br>look like in 2030 as they gear up for<br>animal production we're going to consume<br>more antibiotics so what we've got to be<br>thinking okay we can try and use our<br>antibiotics better right we're going to<br>use 70% more so what we need to do is we<br>need to discover new antimicrobials and<br>these antimicrobials I think need to be<br>purpose built we need to start thinking<br>about using antibiotics and different<br>applications as opposed to using these<br>broad spectrum agents that basically<br>wipe out everything right so we need to<br>discover and develop new<br>antimicrobials right so this is what<br>antimicrobial Discovery looked like this<br>was the Golden Age of Fleming and<br>coworkers so this is where all our<br>antibiotics were discovered right and so<br>this was the point where we thought<br>infectious diseases G over so we<br>basically stopped discovering right so<br>we had this huge Innovation get with<br>this Hiatus from drug discovery suddenly<br>we woke up in about the year 2000 and<br>said oh my goodness we're running out of<br>antibiotics and so that's when the med<br>cam people came in and started making<br>derivatives of various antibiotics right<br>but you can see we had this massive<br>inovation Gap right so we got complacent<br>right but not only did we get<br>complacent and even when we started to<br>discover new analoges it's very very<br>difficult to discover a new<br>antibiotic right first of all it costs<br>somewhere between 800 million to $1.3<br>billion to bring a new antibiotic to<br>market right and the other thing is<br>investors have to wait a very long time<br>so here's an antibiotic that was<br>discovered in 1996 took 18 years to get<br>it into the clinic right so your<br>investors are screaming where's the<br>money where's the money it ain't<br>happening right if you work on a third<br>world disease like TB you're not going<br>to make any money from that right poor<br>people can't afford these<br>drugs right so this is the issue that we<br>we're discovering the things but to get<br>them FDA approved is very difficult and<br>it costs a lot of money to develop<br>them so this just shows our shrinking<br>Arsenal right so this is this is drug<br>development you can see we're just<br>plummeting right we're not this should<br>be going like this but it's going the<br>opposite direction however if you want<br>to work on Obesity or diabetes this is<br>where you need to be because here's a<br>company right so these are two drug<br>here's a drug here for diabetes and<br>there's the other one for an antibiotic<br>and you can see<br>that the drug for diabetes out competes<br>the antibiotic by $1 billion over 5<br>years so it's pretty obvious which one<br>you're going to work on right you're<br>going to work on this one right this is<br>not going to make you any money and the<br>problem that you've got is you're going<br>to have resistance right so we need to<br>there needs to be some incentive<br>academics can play a big role here right<br>cuz big farmer right this is hard for<br>them right so we've got academics have<br>to become more involved in this<br>research right so I think what we need<br>to to do is we need to be developing<br>antibiotics that can be used in animals<br>safely right these antibiotics should<br>not have any analoges in humans so we<br>can use antibiotics in animals if the<br>organisms become resistance it doesn't<br>matter because those same classes of<br>antibiotics are not being used to treat<br>humans right so what we need to do then<br>is we need to discover new antibiotics<br>for the management of environmental<br>microbes right so I've become very<br>passionate about this so obviously I was<br>on the other side of the fence throwing<br>stones now I've engaged right so this is<br>what we need to do and we need to<br>partner with industry right so I<br>actually have three big programs in my<br>lab on in this space the first is new<br>sanitizers for mastitis right mastitis<br>cost the deer industry $280 million a<br>year right the best way to present<br>mastitis is to the best way to combat<br>mastis is to prevent it I couldn't<br>believe this I said well how many<br>sanitizers have you got to do this I<br>thought oh they'll tell me they've got<br>10 they've got two clodine and iodine<br>that's it right that's what they've got<br>to control meritis right that's hopeless<br>right so we've partnered with Dean who<br>are the biggest te spray manufacturers<br>in New Zealand got funding by eggart and<br>we're going to develop new sanitizers<br>right CL hexine is on the World Health<br>Organization list as an essential<br>medicine right it's used in 60 different<br>biomedical applications right we need to<br>have new sanitizers in the space right<br>nitrification nitric oxide emission<br>greenhouse gas emissions right 50 % of<br>New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions<br>come from agriculture right the only way<br>to control this is to develop<br>antimicrobials to combat these organisms<br>so in actual fact we had an amazing<br>compound that did this DCd you spray it<br>on the pastures as soon as the urine<br>patch hits the soil this compound here<br>which is completely harmless stops the<br>bacteria oxidizing that ammonia to<br>nitric oxide which is a potent<br>greenhouse gas problem was DCd looks<br>like melamine and we all know what<br>happened there once again again I<br>thought Oh They'll have 10 of these<br>things they can roll out they don't they<br>have DCd and one other inhibitor so now<br>the farmers don't have anything so that<br>means you can't convert sheep farms to<br>dairy farms I mean this is just huge I<br>just can't I mean for me it's just<br>totally open my eyes right so we've got<br>investment from Ravens our ministry<br>Prime Min to try and develop new<br>Inhibitors and we actually we've<br>actually found new Inhibitors that can<br>do this right the other one I've worked<br>on for a period of time is greenhouse<br>gas emissions right ruminant animals 50<br>L of methane and now 7 million dairy<br>cows do the math right it's potent right<br>we've partnered with aggr search MPI and<br>we've actually developed Inhibitors but<br>I can't show you but I can show you the<br>chemist who made them right these<br>Inhibitors work in sheep they work in<br>beef cattle they reduce methane and<br>guess what animal production is actually<br>increased right so this is where we need<br>to be heading right so these are three<br>programs that I've got on my lab at the<br>moment so I'm not going to talk about<br>those I really want to talk about TB<br>right so tuberculosis disease kills 1.5<br>million people a year 10 million new<br>cases of TB every year of these 10<br>million new cases 5% of them are already<br>drug resistant in China 30% drug<br>resistance so 30% of the strin in China<br>are already multi-drug resistant India<br>20% right we have 200,000 Chinese<br>tourists here a year right they're not<br>screen for TV right so this is why we've<br>got to engage globally right we can't<br>Stop Those strains coming in here very<br>difficult to diagnose incredibly<br>difficult to treat right difficult to<br>diagnose difficult to treat and very<br>very expensive this is a warehouse in<br>myamar right this was just at one Clinic<br>these are all the drugs in their<br>warehouse to treat multi-drug resistant<br>TB right it's just hu it's a huge huge<br>problem right TB is the leading killer<br>of people with HIV kills very fast so<br>you probably think oh well no one's<br>working on TB no one's doing anything<br>well we're spending $10 billion a year<br>to control TB right the problem that<br>we've got is that the incidence of TB is<br>slowing down the problem that we've got<br>is that the percentage of those strains<br>that are drug resistant are increasing<br>that's the issue right so like I said in<br>China That's 30% in New Zealand I think<br>it's 6% India is 20% right myanmar's<br>right up there 30% so it's not about the<br>incidence it's just the the more of<br>these strains are resistant that's the<br>problem right and we haven't developed a<br>drug for 40 years for TB and obviously<br>big farmer don't want to work on drugs<br>for poor people they can't afford it<br>right so that's what we can come in so<br>basically we're fighting a very old<br>disease people often forget TB killed a<br>billion people before we developed the<br>first<br>antimicrobial right so that's a serious<br>disease so we're fighting TB with all of<br>these old drugs that were developed in<br>the 50s if you've got TB that's fully<br>susceptible these are the kinds of drugs<br>that you get if you get mdrtb then you<br>start to get injectables if you get xdr<br>TB then basically we're starting to run<br>out of oxygen options now we have<br>totally drug resistant TB there are no<br>options there are no antibiotics right<br>so this is the problem what we're sorry<br>about the slide what we want with TB of<br>course is drugs that are not toxic many<br>of those old drugs for TB they would<br>never be FDA approved now they're too<br>toxic right they make you feel very ill<br>when you're taking them right so<br>toxicity is an issue they have to be<br>active against MDR and xdr TB there's no<br>point developing new regimens to treat<br>TB if they can't combat the resistance<br>strains the other big problem is how do<br>we combat latent TB you know two billion<br>people have been infected with this<br>organism right so these are the issues<br>that we face and obviously the question<br>is how are we going to find these drugs<br>and for people that have got xdr<br>HIV this is a Race Against Time for<br>their families right their life<br>expectancy is very short we need a game<br>changer<br>right we need to change the game how we<br>do this right so our hypothesis in our<br>group is that new drugs will be<br>developed through an increased<br>understanding of how bacteria metabolize<br>and persist in our bodies or how they<br>persist in the environment if we're<br>talking about environmental pathogens<br>right so if we can understand that then<br>we can actually develop new classes of<br>antibiotics people often<br>forget in bacteria We have basically<br>five essential targets right most<br>bacteria have got about 4,000 genes and<br>what I'm telling you is that we're only<br>drugging five of those essential targets<br>what we want to do is say why can't we<br>drugs so for example most bacteria have<br>a genome of about 4,000 genes so TB is<br>an example of this has 4,000 genes 614<br>of those genes are essential for its<br>viability so then my question is well<br>why don't we have 614 targets right so<br>that's what we want to think about we<br>want to get out of these old targets and<br>get into new targets but in order to do<br>that we need to understand what is the<br>organism doing in our body so TB is a<br>very tricky organism because it has a<br>very diverse pathology it actually sets<br>up in the very host cells that we that<br>we used to destroy it right so it's able<br>to disable that machinery and persist in<br>these<br>macres right and what you have to do<br>when you have TB drugs you have to take<br>the antibiotics for 6 months because you<br>have to kill the last remaining cell<br>because some of these cells are<br>non-replicating right so you need a drug<br>that kills a non-replicating cell right<br>so this is a big problem the good thing<br>here is that this is a metabolic<br>adaptation these bacteria don't go to<br>sleep right they interact with your<br>immune system and they metabolize toast<br>lipids so they're alive they're viable<br>which means if we can uncover what those<br>pathways are and develop drugs against<br>them we can kill them so that's exactly<br>what we've done we've figured out that<br>the most crucial part of this organism's<br>physiology or its Achilles heel is its<br>energy generating Machinery so the power<br>plant of the cell that keeps the cell<br>alive is its Achilles heel and so what<br>we did is we basically validated so this<br>is the machine here so this is the ATP<br>synthes this is the machine that the<br>bacterium uses to make its energy and<br>what you can see here is that this this<br>energy generating machine is powered by<br>these other complexes right so this is I<br>don't want I know this is Public<br>Relation I'll keep it simple but this<br>machine basically consumes protons from<br>respiration to make energy and what<br>we've been able to do is to do<br>mutagenesis and validate that many of<br>these complexes are essential for the<br>organism what we also know is that some<br>of these complexes are important in<br>persistence and resistance to other<br>antibiotics so we were working on this<br>complex for a number of years and we're<br>able to show that it was essential for<br>the viability of the organism<br>simultaneously while we were working on<br>this basically Johnson and<br>Johnson a company in Belgium Jansen Farm<br>Pharmaceuticals were doing a phenotypic<br>screen so basically what they were doing<br>is they were looking for new molecules<br>that inhibited the growth of<br>tuberculosis and and this is the most<br>significant Discovery in TB research in<br>the last 50 years and what they<br>basically found was that they found this<br>compound here called Dar Quinones and<br>they showed that this compound actually<br>hit the very machine that we were<br>working on right so we had validated<br>this enzyme as being essential for the<br>viability and the survival of this<br>pathogen<br>but we didn't have a drug against it we<br>actually never thought it would be<br>drugable right what Johnson and Johnson<br>did is they found this compound that<br>inhibited the growth of TB and then what<br>they were able to do is they were able<br>to show through mutagenesis that this<br>drug actually targets the ATP synthes<br>right this revolutionized the way that<br>we treat TB the reason for this was that<br>this is a target that's never ever been<br>considered for drug Discovery in the<br>history of antimicrobial<br>discovery right and the beauty of this<br>phenotypic screening is that the<br>compounds identify the Target right<br>we've been fixated on getting a<br>molecular Target getting the high<br>resolution crystal structure doing and<br>silico docking and trying to find<br>Inhibitors like that that's failed<br>measurably that's produced nothing right<br>these guys went back and just use<br>compound libraries just libraries of<br>compounds they screen they said oh we've<br>got a compound that inhibits the bug<br>what does it hit hits this target the<br>reason why this revolutionized the field<br>is that this compound Works in 8 weeks<br>right so instead of having a bacterion<br>that we've got to treat for months 6<br>months if it's fully susceptible 24<br>months if it's drug resistant this<br>compound is active against all drug<br>resistant strains right and it can kill<br>TB it can achieve sterilization in 8<br>weeks so suddenly this drug is the game<br>Cher so now we moveed from 24 months to<br>8 weeks and obviously what we want to do<br>with tib we want to move to two weeks we<br>want to treat this like any other<br>bacterial<br>infection right so that's our goal we<br>want to be here cuz if we're here we can<br>probably eradicate TB New Zealand's Got<br>one of the lowest rates of TB in the<br>world right but we still need to reduce<br>the incidence by 70 fold to get rid of<br>it and who is designated New Zealand as<br>a country that could become TB free<br>right that's got to be a goal to do that<br>we need better Diagnostics and better<br>drugs we were very lucky so we<br>collaborated with K andrees right from<br>the start because obviously we<br>identified the molecular Target<br>validated its essentiality validated its<br>role in the cell so we were given the<br>drug from day one and what that enabled<br>us to do was to partner with corn Andre<br>right what was also amazing is that this<br>drug was<br>fast-tracked right so this drug didn't<br>wait 18 years to get into the clinic it<br>waited about 8 years but it was actually<br>FDA approved in 2012 and the reason for<br>that is patients with xdr mdrtb they<br>didn't have any options right so the<br>drug does come with a black box label<br>right there's a few things that they<br>don't understand about it right it's a<br>very lipophilic compound there were<br>unexplained deaths in the trials but<br>this drug is actually being used in<br>hospitals all over the world and a lot<br>of clinicians I talk to they say there's<br>no issues Bill Denny very prominent um<br>chemist from the University of ockland<br>cancer researcher he's actually been<br>given the contract from the TB Global<br>Alliance to make analoges of this drug<br>so this drug is called<br>bacalan right and so what Bill's been<br>able to do he's been able to synthesize<br>analoges of this drug that overcomes<br>some of these toxicity problems<br>right so this drug is going to be a<br>massive success right it's going to be a<br>blockbuster for Jensen you talk to<br>Jensen scientists they tell you well the<br>bean counters are telling them every day<br>to stop working on it CU they're not<br>going to make any money out of it right<br>so it's a humanitarian effort right but<br>what's nice to see is that New Zealand<br>has played a major role in bringing this<br>drug into the<br>clinic so the big question about this<br>drug was this is the enzyme that it<br>targets and what it does it binds to<br>this rotary element of the enzyme and<br>what it does it stops the enzyme<br>rotating and therefore stops the enzyme<br>from making ATP so the so the the<br>molecule goes in here and basically jams<br>the rotation of this little rotary<br>engine that's how it works right and so<br>the the working the working model was<br>that basically the cells run out of ATP<br>and they die right but that didn't<br>really explain right we've got lots of<br>bacteria that we can deplete them of ATP<br>and they don't die so what we worked on<br>with Johnson and Johnson was to figure<br>out exactly how this drug works and so<br>what we were able to do is actually we<br>published with Johnson and Johnson on<br>the bacterio cdal mode of action of this<br>drug last year and what we were able to<br>show is that this drug actually kills TB<br>via an uncoupler mechanism and some of<br>you might recognize that name uncouplers<br>so back in the war when the they were<br>handling explosives a lot of the people<br>used to lose have chronic weight loss<br>and the reason for that was their<br>mitochondria was uncoupled right so<br>basically they couldn't produce any<br>energy so they just wasted away and in<br>actual fact some people use this as a<br>diet pill right dinitrophenol very<br>dangerous but if you take low doses of<br>it you can actually uncouple your<br>mitochondria and you lose weight so<br>maybe this is going to be a treatment<br>for obesity I don't know right so in<br>anyway pacin has a very similar mode of<br>action except that it doesn't do it in<br>mitochondria it only does it specific<br>for TB so it was very important that we<br>worked out this mode of action to<br>explain how it kills the organism what<br>we've been able to do is if we look now<br>at what clinical cadidates are coming<br>out so there's bacin if we look at the<br>the latest compounds going into clinical<br>trials they also Target other parts of<br>this complex and what we've been able to<br>show is that these compounds also work<br>as uncouplers even though they're<br>hitting different molecular targets<br>right so what we need to do then we know<br>that this is a fantastic pathway for<br>drug development but danin tells us this<br>in these new preclinical canons that<br>we're actually working on other<br>compounds that hit this and this is part<br>of my involvement in the mors wiing<br>center I'll skip over this so what we<br>rationalized was that this is the<br>structure of bacin I know this is way<br>too much chemistry but this part of the<br>molecule here is very important for its<br>mode of action and what we're able to<br>recognize was that there are other<br>molecules that have a very similar<br>structure right and one of the molecules<br>that we became interested was this<br>compound called aide so a myid is a<br>diuretic right it actually inhibit an<br>epithelial sodium channel right so it it<br>prevents s it prevents pottassium loss<br>but gets rid of sodium right so it's a<br>very potent diuretic so we thought well<br>maybe this molecule here might actually<br>have activity against TB because this<br>group right here is very similar to the<br>most important group in Balin except<br>this molecule is not very lipophilic<br>compared to<br>bacin so then we said okay let's see if<br>we can do this and what I can tell you<br>is actually the HRC really like this<br>Grant and I'll show you why they<br>probably did and we actually got funded<br>to work on this right so this is a Myer<br>ride it's been used clinically for 30<br>years to treat it's a it's a um<br>potassium sping diuretic and what it<br>does it Targets this um the sodium<br>channel in our kidneys right so what<br>that does it's used to treat<br>hypertension and congestive heart fail<br>so it blocks this channel right so it<br>promotes the loss of sodium and water<br>from the body without depleting<br>potassium right so that's very important<br>you don't want to treat a deplete<br>potassium so what we what we put for to<br>the see is can we selectively optimize<br>our myo structure for more potent<br>inhibition of the tuberculosis ATP synas<br>right and this would be a new therapy<br>for TB right the novelty of the<br>chemistry structures would make this<br>class extremely attractive for patenting<br>right it's a new class of<br>molecules so that's what we did so there<br>was a myid so we could show that it was<br>very poor inhibitor of TB about 256<br>microm this isn't very good right but<br>what we're able to show us if we start<br>to make modifications of this molecule<br>we can get quickly down to 32 we did a<br>whole lot more Med Kim and I can't show<br>you the structures but now we're at four<br>right so we've gone from 256 to 4 microl<br>so now we're starting to get to the<br>potency that we need to see and really<br>we haven't even started this project<br>what's really cool about these compounds<br>is that they actually inhibit so there<br>are already strains of TB that are<br>resistant to pacin these molecules are<br>able to inhibit these strains right so<br>they can overcome resistant mechanism<br>this is the chemist that I partnered<br>with a guy called Mike Kelo he's an<br>associate professor at the University of<br>wooling gong right so and he was<br>actually working on these compounds as<br>anti-cancer<br>targets they're very very effective<br>Inhibitors of ATP<br>synthes they're also bind to the targets<br>so remember the target of these<br>molecules of bacin is this rotary<br>element of the ATP synthes and our<br>molecules are also very effective<br>binders to this target so we know they<br>inhibit TB we know they bind to the<br>molecular Target with good Affinity we<br>know that they can kill TB inside macr<br>farges right so we've now got inv vitro<br>activity and what's really important is<br>they don't have any sodium Channel<br>activity so they're not diuretics<br>anymore which is important right we<br>don't want to be treating someone for TB<br>and the drug having a diuretic effect so<br>this is very very exciting right our<br>goal right my goal at the University of<br>Tara my goal in the part of the mors<br>wiing center is to get drugs into phase<br>one right we would like to get a drug<br>made in New Zealand into phase one<br>clinical trials right that's the goal of<br>our research right and so the goal of<br>the TB Global Alliance is to get 21<br>repurposed anti-tb drugs in here by the<br>year 2020 so these are our current drugs<br>in the pipeline and you can see there's<br>lots and lots of drugs in the discovery<br>phase so you can see for<br>tuberculosis even though we've got<br>totally drug resistant strains we have a<br>heap of compounds in development right A<br>lot of these are going to<br>fail right but the more that we can feed<br>in here then obviously we'll have more<br>success at getting in near therapeutic<br>for this<br>organism right so that's where I'll<br>leave it so this is my group at the<br>University of Oto and I've been very<br>fortunate over the last 20 years to have<br>some very good funding and I said I<br>think what this I remember Warren Tate<br>told me this when I came back to New<br>Zealand he said to me if you do good<br>work in New Zealand you'll get funded<br>and you'll have a fantastic career here<br>and he was absolutely bang on the money<br>so I never left and I've been well<br>funded and I want to thank you for your<br>time<br>tonight so thank you very much Greg for<br>a very um wide ranging talk and very<br>thought-provoking talk now I know that<br>Greg is happy to answer questions so if<br>anybody has questions we have a roving<br>mic<br>so thank you very that thank you and um<br>that was a great fascinating talk and<br>great to see that you are that you've<br>persisted uh with this research because<br>there was a while there when you were<br>looked as though you were about to give<br>it all up because you were a bit<br>dispirited about a decade ago but I just<br>wondering getting back to the animal use<br>of antibiotics and fantastic that you're<br>doing this exciting new research but why<br>are we still you know using some of<br>these antibiotics not to treat animals<br>when they're sick but<br>for you know just to prevent disease<br>spreading through um a flock of chickens<br>for example um so especially when you<br>were saying that in some of the research<br>you did a decade ago there was 97%<br>resistance so are there alternatives are<br>you looking at things like probiotics<br>instead of<br>antibiotics um you know are there you<br>know why can't we stop feeding them uh<br>to literally for example to millions of<br>chickens who are not sick and two other<br>quick questions are we looking in the<br>environment in the waterways for example<br>um for antibiotic resistant bacteria or<br>even because when you feed them the<br>chickens they go into the um you know<br>into the this what what's it called you<br>know the stuff the the that the chicken<br>that goes right through into the stuff<br>that is then spread around in the<br>environment the um you know chicken<br>manure for example so are they testing<br>the chicken manure the water and the<br>waterways that sort of thing I mean I<br>think yep great questions I think this<br>is really important so I think there's a<br>there's a couple of things to consider<br>here right the first thing is it doesn't<br>matter whether where we use antibiotics<br>we can use them anywhere and we'll find<br>antibiotic resistant organisms right<br>right so that's the first key point the<br>second key point is we don't have a very<br>good<br>understanding about what is the impact<br>of antibiotic resistance strains in<br>animals and those animal strains are<br>adapted to animals and so the the big<br>the big Smoking Gun is right can animal<br>strains and I could tell you the the<br>number of reports on this I could count<br>them on one hand where there's very<br>strong evidence that an antibiotic<br>resistant organism created in a chick<br>and a pig or whatever went on to cause m<br>disease in a human and some of that's<br>got to do with the fact that those<br>strains are adapted to animals and some<br>of those strains are adapted to humans<br>so the V was a fantastic example right<br>so I think we had over 300 isolates of<br>anomis resist in Acky right if we look<br>to New Zealand hospitals probably over<br>the same period we've probably had about<br>20 or 30 isolates right so we had this<br>massive massive reservoir of anomis<br>resis organisms but yet our hospitals<br>didn't have a problem with this right if<br>you went to the US they never used AA<br>Parson right so you would never find vom<br>resist inra Coco in their bro production<br>and if you would ask me who's the<br>country in the world that has the<br>biggest problem with v America massive V<br>in their hospitals right so this this<br>was always the issue that that clearly<br>if we feed antibiotics to animals we'll<br>create antibiotic resistant<br>organisms realistically those<br>antibiotics are sub therpeutic what I<br>mean by that is that they are levels<br>which give the organism a chance to<br>become resistant right when you go to a<br>doctor he doesn't tell you to go home<br>and take a sub therapeutic dose of the<br>antibiotic he probably gives you the<br>antibiotic it's probably 10 or 50 times<br>the mic basically he wants that<br>antibiotic to absolutely smash that<br>organism so it can't become resistance<br>so I think I think that's the issue and<br>of course if you go and look in the<br>environment you're going to find these<br>organisms you'll find them in the<br>waterways but but what is the true<br>impact of that and I guess the question<br>is we don't we don't understand what it<br>is right I mean we could and and and in<br>Europe right there's lots of studies<br>coming out of Europe now where they've<br>stopped using antibiotics and actually<br>what they show is that the the the<br>animals do better right but they've got<br>to have different farming practices so I<br>think it's a it's hard to know and I<br>mean I think what we were trying to I<br>mean if you talk to the poultry<br>production they're just doing what what<br>they're allowed to do they are allowed<br>to do this because math allows them to<br>do this there's regulations they have a<br>vet they prescribe the antibiotics right<br>so I think it's<br>we can't just point the finger and say<br>oh there's the problem right there<br>because in actual fact what problem has<br>that caused in humans so yeah it's it's<br>a very difficult question I mean we've<br>now done deep sequencing on all of those<br>strains and we look at them we say well<br>man these strains look the same but then<br>the strains in humans are not best<br>stration resistant the ones in animals<br>are so it's yeah I mean probably in the<br>next 6 months we might have a better<br>picture now that we're doing whole<br>genome sequencing on all those animal<br>isolates and all those human isolates<br>over that complete period so yeah it's<br>it's hard to know I mean I think yeah<br>watch this space but I think I even saw<br>an article today where I think a company<br>in America now I mean places like<br>McDonald's can takey Fri chicken they're<br>putting pressure on their supplies that<br>they will not accept meat from animals<br>that have been fed antibiotics so I<br>think public can apply this pressure but<br>but if you were have say me what's<br>what's the<br>cook I really uh enjoyed this immensely<br>um for all sorts of reasons I having<br>spent seven years as an HRC board member<br>it is fantastic to see um the impact and<br>the outcome of it so I'm delighted to<br>been uh had the chance to come here uh I<br>was the world's worst microbiologist<br>ever I did a degree in bney BG a million<br>years<br>ago my question is and one once again we<br>show my absolute<br>ignorance the new candidates that you're<br>developing mhm what is to stop those<br>then becoming subject to resistance<br>developing despite the very targeted um<br>mechanisms that you're looking for yep<br>so that's so I can tell you how are<br>we're going to find out how these drugs<br>validation of our mechanism of action<br>will be we will'll actually generate<br>resistant isolates in the lab to these<br>compounds so we can do that in the lab<br>what we'll do is we'll passage these<br>organisms at sub therapeutic levels and<br>then we'll look for mutants and then<br>we'll sequence the Genome of those<br>mutants and hopefully those mutations<br>will map what what they will tell us<br>they will tell us the types of mutations<br>that could arise when these drugs start<br>to be used in the clinic so we can<br>generate these mutants in the lab to<br>find this out I mean obviously what<br>we've got to make sure when we use these<br>drugs if these drugs get to be used with<br>TB one thing that's people don't often<br>realize that in TB you're often on for<br>drugs right it's a cocktail of drugs and<br>so people have this very simple notion<br>that you take one drug it hits this<br>Target and kills the organism you have<br>this drug hits a different Target and<br>kills the organism what happens when you<br>combine these drugs the mechanism of<br>action is completely different and that<br>was something that that that I didn't<br>realize but the studies are now showing<br>when you put these drugs together you<br>get a different mechanism of action you<br>get a lot of off Target effects so so<br>that will be the key for TB we will not<br>use these Amo and monotherapy we will<br>use them with other drug combinations<br>that are<br>synergistic right so that will be our<br>goal and obviously we have to we have to<br>reserve these drugs for people that have<br>got drug resistant TB because these<br>people don't have any choice so yeah we<br>just have to be very careful how we do<br>this mean bacin there's already<br>resistance but the problem with bacalan<br>and this is what really irritates me is<br>that the people during the trials they<br>refuse to take Balin and stick it in a<br>new regimen what what they do is they<br>take bacalan and they add it to four old<br>drugs and so they're adding it to<br>regimens where the organisms are already<br>resistant to it right that just makes no<br>sense and you talk to them I say well<br>you're an idiot don't you realize if we<br>change the regimen this is going to cost<br>billions and billions and billions of<br>dollars and we we don't we can't afford<br>it so that's what they're doing they're<br>taking the new drugs and they're adding<br>to them to the old regimens right okay<br>they're getting much faster killing but<br>I just it makes no sense to me<br>but that's what they're doing there's<br>one school of thought that they want to<br>completely change but this is going to<br>be billions of dollars and it's going to<br>probably take decades yeah so we've just<br>got to be really careful how we use<br>these and not mismanage<br>them Professor cook just as a followup<br>to the last issue um very pleasing to<br>see the uh sound research that you're<br>actually doing on as far as TV and<br>antibiotic resistance now I just sort of<br>wonder in terms of other<br>life-threatening diseases MRSA other<br>strap to cocky infection rheumatic fever<br>and other problems which New Zealand has<br>are similar developments in terms of<br>antibiotics<br>happening in New Zealand and elsewhere<br>to overcome you know other<br>life-threatening illnesses so romatic<br>fever and I was actually just a to talk<br>about this today the strategies there<br>are not drugs because that organism<br>remains antibiotic susceptible can treat<br>it with Penicillin so the key there is<br>uh uh they're basically telling me<br>Diagnostics<br>vaccines right I think sanitizers has<br>got to play a big role in there right so<br>in terms of group a strip there they<br>don't need drugs they need they need<br>these other tools right MRSA I mean drug<br>companies are spending a lot of money in<br>the space I mean we HRC came to the<br>party again so I don't know if people<br>saw the the big story was that one of<br>the last antibiotics that we used to<br>treat multi-drug resistant eolo was an<br>antibiotic called kistan right it was<br>very toxic we actually had our first<br>kistin resistant isolate in pigs<br>reported in China last year right soon<br>as they identified that mechanism of<br>resistance they found out very quickly<br>it was already in<br>humans right so these polymix and<br>antibiotics that Target the cell<br>membrane which is considered a very poor<br>Target right so we but but we only had<br>kistin left well there's resistance now<br>and we've gone back and screened some of<br>the freezers into needen hospital and<br>actually the clist KN it's already there<br>so HRC just funded a a pro a project for<br>Margaret brimble to develop poly mixing<br>analoges and what I can tell you is that<br>we've already screened her first six<br>analogs and they actually killed kistan<br>resistant eoli so I mean there's there's<br>a lot of exciting science here I mean<br>the chemists are going to be crucial in<br>this development right people that know<br>what good drugs look like what groups of<br>drugs are really important I mean we<br>need we need biologists need to partner<br>with chemist chemist underpin everything<br>and so that that's one good thing I've<br>never worked with chemist in my whole<br>career and I've started working with<br>chemist very closely in the last 3 to<br>four years and it's really opened my<br>eyes so so there's a lot of research<br>going in especially a bug like Eola<br>right because that cost that's going to<br>make a lot of money for the people<br>working in this area um so yeah there's<br>on thank you very very much for<br>enlightening presentation and good luck<br>for Success uh I guess my concern and I<br>don't think you're saying this is that<br>agreed we have to find new drugs and<br>this is a new drug or a couple of drugs<br>that may be effective against<br>tuberculosis my concern is that we don't<br>change our behavior and you did kind of<br>start to touch on this around prudent<br>use you know we use less we have bit of<br>infection control we use vaccines we<br>have bit of management in regard to<br>animals say that we will just get<br>veterinarians and doctors continuing to<br>use and the public expecting that great<br>this is another drug that's come along<br>we can continue to abuse it and you kind<br>of started to answer that in the second<br>to last question yeah you you're<br>absolutely bang on the money we need to<br>change our Behavior so I lived in<br>Switzerland for a couple of years um I<br>got sick there a number of times my<br>family got sick there a number of times<br>and I can tell you in the whole two<br>years we lived there not one of us was<br>given an antibiotic basically they just<br>said no not giving you antibiotic<br>whereas I can tell you um my family in<br>the last two weeks one of them has been<br>to the doctor and it's Come Away with an<br>antibiotic so and there was no swabbing<br>no nothing given an antibiotic cuz she<br>had green snot right so I think you're<br>right it's problematic I mean I'm going<br>down I'm going down to gore next Tuesday<br>to talk to the vets down there at vet<br>South and then I'm going to go somewhere<br>else down there and talk to more vets<br>and it's because I I mean i' unless you<br>go out there and talk to these people I<br>mean I'm an academic I sit in my lab and<br>I think they've got these problems and I<br>think I've got these Solutions but I<br>never thought for one minute they needed<br>a sanitizer I thought they needed you<br>antibiotics and they said no no we don't<br>we need sanitizers so that changed our<br>whole research Focus to sanitizers right<br>forget about antibiotics we need<br>sanitizers to actually prevent<br>mastitis right so I think it's really<br>good to engage and I mean I think what<br>was really disappointing for me 10 years<br>ago and so back me up on this we<br>actually had clinicians that weren't<br>supporting us clinicians are going<br>antibiotic resistance cooked stop<br>pouring petrol on the fire you're a fire<br>brand bugger off and that's kind of<br>really dis I was really disillusioned by<br>that and I've noticed in the last 2 or<br>three years guys like Mark Thomas Debbie<br>Williamson these guys have come out on<br>the front foot and said hey it's a<br>bloody issue we need to do something<br>about us and then suddenly now it's a<br>big problem because now the clinicians<br>are saying it's a big problem so that<br>irritated me a little bit but I'm really<br>happy that they suddenly said yes it's<br>an issue but it's not an issue with<br>every single bacterial pathogen it would<br>be wrong to say well every bacterian has<br>become resistant to every single that's<br>not true right TB is a good example<br>because we have<br>strains on the planet that are resistant<br>to all 10 antibiotics that's an issue<br>there are no antibiotics for those<br>strains right so so that's been really<br>pleasing to see that that we've been<br>able to get out there and realize it's<br>not just about feeding antibiotics to<br>animals uh yes I'm interested in the<br>balance between um antibiotics and<br>vaccinations I mean I understand why it<br>has to be so highly towards vaccinations<br>for viruses because they're using our<br>own metabolism I I I'm interested that<br>you've managed to get into the bacterial<br>metabolism that's also Central to our<br>own cells and not you know not to do<br>with their unique kind of cell wall but<br>um that's another question but when I<br>was in the third form at school we all<br>lined up and had our BCG and I I know<br>it's not 100% effective but has there<br>been decay in the protection of people<br>from TB globally I mean it's very<br>depressing that there's just so much of<br>it still when when there is a vac a<br>vaccine a vaccine it's it's the whole of<br>populations the vaccine doesn't work on<br>and so there's been millions and tens<br>and millions of dollars gone into<br>developing new vaccines and we're still<br>using a vaccine that's probably 100<br>years old so that's the issue and a lot<br>of people have stopped working on<br>vaccines so there are big groups in the<br>UK St I mean vaccine's what we want we<br>like for example those environmental<br>issues right methanogens we want a<br>vaccine Farmers don't want to be going<br>putting a bolus of Inhibitors into the<br>cow because then fonter are going to be<br>complaining about residues I mean we<br>want a vaccine right that's what we'd<br>love we'd love vaccines to vaccinate<br>against all these things but I mean for<br>TB we need vaccines drugs and we need<br>Diagnostics right Diagnostics alone<br>could save 500,000 lives a year right<br>being able because you know xdr TB we<br>don't we don't have a diagnostic apart<br>from second line DST which is basically<br>Phenix typic diagnostic we want a<br>molecular diagnostic we've got a<br>molecular diagnostic for ndr TV but not<br>xdr so that's the issue because if we're<br>able if we were able to diagnose that<br>guy into Hospital which took 66 days if<br>we could diagnosed him in 6 hours then<br>we could have said right we need to give<br>you these five antibiotics what we're<br>actually proposing to do and why we're<br>working in myamar is that we want to use<br>whole genome sequencing we want you to<br>come into the hospital we take a sputum<br>sample from you we amplify the genomic<br>DNA of PB that's in your sputum we<br>sequence it and then we'll be able to<br>tell you next morning you've got a<br>strain that's resistant to these six<br>drugs CU we know what the mutations are<br>and we need to give you these five<br>antibiotics that's our dream we could<br>actually do this in New Zealand because<br>we only get one isolate you know we have<br>one isolate of TV a day we could<br>actually use whole genome sequencing to<br>diagnose drug resistant TB in New<br>Zealand we could move towards<br>eradication of<br>TB<br>question um thank you very much for the<br>nice presentation my question is about<br>India and it's not one question only<br>because all questions are related the<br>first thing is you gave the stat about<br>um High use of antibiotics in India my<br>question is is that used on human or<br>it's also on animals is is the big um<br>data the big number isn't it yeah my<br>understanding it's human use yeah human<br>use second thing is like why the doctors<br>straight away give antibiotics in India<br>because the tests are so expensive I<br>think it's the cost like the TV gold<br>cost 3,000 rupees which is like $600 you<br>know and while the antibiotics would<br>cost like 15 rupees or 100 rupees so<br>every time you you get a cough you know<br>they think that oh it's and they<br>straight away give you antibiotics it<br>could be to treat pneumonia or any<br>anything like that you know so that is<br>the big problem there you know and you<br>can get the antibiotics straight away<br>you don't going to the doctor costs<br>money so you go to the farmacy say<br>straight away people just buy the<br>antibiotics straight away without even<br>going to the doctor right so now you're<br>the test in Myanmar is it very expensive<br>or is it like you know when the person<br>comes you know and then you tell him<br>this is the Genome of the bacteria and<br>how expensive that test I mean how is it<br>going to help the poor countries you<br>know yeah so great questions so for<br>example in Myanmar they have Gene expert<br>machines which are basically molecular<br>based tools to diagnose drug resistant<br>TB this is all funded by The Gates<br>Foundation wh so so obviously in Myanmar<br>no one could afford this right so it's<br>all funded internationally right and<br>they're rolling out these GX machines<br>all throughout<br>Myanmar right so that's never going to<br>work I mean that will work as long as<br>International people are prepared to<br>fund this right but soon as that dries<br>up then yeah who knows what's going to<br>happen so what we're trying to do is<br>we're trying to bring research to mamar<br>so that they can so for example they<br>couldn't do second line phenotypic<br>testing there they can now do this<br>because we've trained them how to do it<br>right so this is what we want to do and<br>that's it's great that I've got my<br>postto who's from miar cuz he's very<br>passionate about and he can go back and<br>communicate with the people but you're<br>right it's a massive International<br>effort in Myanmar and because people<br>realize if you don't it's like the<br>Australians they're totally engag<br>globally because the big threat for them<br>is Papa New Guinea right drug resistant<br>TV and Papa New Guinea is out of control<br>if you talk to Australian Physicians<br>they'll tell you you could go in there<br>with 10 new antibiotics tomorrow you're<br>not going to have any impact right<br>because you need Diagnostics you need<br>vaccines you need all three yeah so<br>great points y so I think we need to um<br>draw the formal part of the talk uh to a<br>close now but we would like to invite<br>you to come through and have some<br>refreshments with you with us and um<br>Professor cook will be there so you can<br>ask him questions oneon-one but I'd like<br>you now to just um thank Professor cook<br>talk time was it<br>perfect</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
