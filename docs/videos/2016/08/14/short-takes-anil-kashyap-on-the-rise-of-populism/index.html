School of Business discusses the economic dislocations fuelling today's populist movements.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>populism is very much on the rise if you<br>if you just look brexit is the the<br>latest flavor of the month but uh the<br>United States election has been you know<br>captured by two very different people Mr<br>Sanders and Mr Trump who seem to have<br>nothing in common except a lot of anger<br>uh you can see the popular parties uh<br>usually on the far right in Europe that<br>are on the rise Italy's got a very very<br>active movement there's been one in<br>Finland there's another one in the um<br>the Netherlands and so there are all<br>these different pockets of angst and<br>frustration that are present that I<br>would say 15 years ago were well below<br>the surface so I see all these different<br>movements being fueled essentially by<br>economic discontent if you look at<br>what's happened to the middle class over<br>say the last 15 to 20 years there's been<br>a growing Chasm between what's been<br>going on for the people at the very top<br>of the income distribution than what's<br>happened to the people in the middle and<br>it used to be the case that pretty much<br>anywhere in the advanced world you were<br>confident that your kids were going to<br>wind up having a better future than you<br>had or a better better future than than<br>yours was and better lives and I think<br>that has been lost middle class income<br>have stagnated pretty much everywhere in<br>the world um in the advanced countries<br>there's been massive progress in poorer<br>countries if you look at what's happened<br>in China in the last 15 years it's<br>probably been the greatest anti-poverty<br>program we've ever seen but that doesn't<br>matter the people in the M uh the middle<br>of the United States or in Continental<br>Europe or even in the UK all these<br>places you've seen slowdown in wages um<br>drops in productivity<br>uh gains only concentrated amongst the<br>most highly educated and and people are<br>very frustrated with that I think a lot<br>of the factors that are behind this are<br>here to stay so technology has has taken<br>away a lot of jobs the combination of<br>technology and globalization has meant<br>that a lot of activities have migrated<br>away from people that used to say finish<br>High School they'd go on and they'd work<br>in some sort of manufacturing job they<br>could could raise a family their kids<br>could go on to to more education if they<br>wanted you could have all the Comforts<br>of society and you could live a pretty<br>good life those jobs have been lost<br>they're not present in the United States<br>and Europe to a large extent anymore and<br>they're not coming back and I think part<br>of the driver for the economic<br>frustration is we haven't replaced those<br>jobs with new things so we haven't found<br>a way to put the people that would have<br>gone into those positions to work<br>elsewhere and so they're left looking<br>around saying you know what's going to<br>come for me I think New Zealand and a<br>lot of the commodity producing countries<br>may have benefited from a<br>one-time uh change in China so China's<br>gone about as far as it can with its<br>existing growth model in my view they<br>they've built all the highways and Roads<br>and infrastructure and and transform<br>their economy in a pretty serious way<br>and that required massive Imports of of<br>all kinds of Commodities and that<br>happened to be you know going on for the<br>last seven or eight years it's it's<br>definitely the case China's slowing I<br>don't think China's going to return to 8<br>to 10% growth for an extended period<br>ever again I think they're going to be<br>more in the five four six range and<br>that'll be felt around the world and so<br>some of the places that were insulated<br>temporarily from these forces I think<br>are going to be feeling them if you look<br>at what's happening in Brazil Brazil was<br>a country where when they were awarded<br>the Olympic Games and the World Cup it<br>looked like Brazil was on the rise it<br>was a country that had turned the corner<br>in fact we we see that they hadn't in<br>fact they were just riding a commodity<br>bubble and that covered up a lot of of<br>problems and now it's front and center<br>on the world stage I think the challenge<br>for policies to deal with the scenario<br>I've described is there's there's two<br>directions to go the first is to stop<br>looking backwards and prot prend that we<br>can return to the 1950s a lot of the<br>presidential campaign that's<br>anti-trade pretends that we can just go<br>back and everything's going to be okay<br>and that if we could just reverse some<br>things that that we could return to the<br>world we were once and I think that's a<br>farce there's no chance of that and it's<br>destructive because it focuses attention<br>and energy uh in the wrong places I<br>think what we need to do is work on<br>educational outcomes improving kind of<br>what what we economists call human<br>capital people's Readiness to be able to<br>embrace technology and work with it<br>we've just got too many people that<br>enter the workforce without the skills<br>they need to be able to get good<br>high-paying jobs this is a problem<br>everywhere the us maybe New Zealand has<br>an additional problem which is the more<br>diverse you are I think the harder it is<br>to get everybody to pull together Behind<br>these kinds of outcomes the the<br>countries where this is where there's<br>been less of this tend to be countries<br>that are more homogeneous where you can<br>do things that involve sacrifices in the<br>short run for the the long-term gain<br>because everybody kind of feels like<br>they're in it together if if there's um<br>political gains to be had from<br>ostracizing people and pointing you know<br>this guy's the problem that guy's the<br>problem it distracts you from getting on<br>with it it makes it harder to to take<br>the steps we need if the way that this<br>is put is we're going to do some<br>difficult stuff now to make our kids<br>better off uh I think that's an<br>achievable uh plan Germany offers one<br>case study a government fell in Germany<br>in 2004 and five because they enacted a<br>bunch of very difficult reforms to try<br>to stop defending uh the old types of<br>jobs that were moving away and create a<br>better partnership between the the<br>workers and the firms to try to move<br>into a a more 21st century style economy<br>and and the gains have been very<br>tangible Germany's doing better than any<br>other country in Europe in large part<br>because they had a really rough time in<br>the middle of the last uh decade and you<br>know the government fell so there's no<br>doubt that there will be some short-term<br>pain for enacting the kinds of changes<br>that we need but I think the alternative<br>is far worse stagnation for 15 years is<br>going to just generate more and more<br>discontent eventually you'll get a<br>political backlash like brexit or you<br>know the election of somebody who's a<br>really radical figure if you don't you<br>know take the steps now this doesn't all<br>have to be Grim if you can convince<br>people that the future is going to be<br>bright again that there is hope that<br>technology isn't just evil globalization<br>isn't bad that we can bring gains uh to<br>to everyone but we need to focus on<br>trying to get them ready for it that can<br>that can be a somewhat optimistic<br>message so I think if we've concentrated<br>on that and made that the priority<br>instead of getting distracted with all<br>achievable</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
