font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>on Mondays we have our professional<br>learning and during that time teachers<br>bring any writing that the children have<br>done and part of that meeting was that<br>we had to build our collective knowledge<br>we had to build our understanding of<br>acceleration understanding of what<br>practices brought about acceleration and<br>brought about success for our children<br>we bring along evidence of what we tried<br>and then the impact of those practices<br>the role of the other people in the<br>group is to listen to learn but then<br>once that person's finished presenting<br>we've got some questions that we can ask<br>to support that teacher to think<br>critically about their practice it<br>wasn't really hard to begin with we've<br>got much more comfortable around having<br>our peers challenge our practice and to<br>ask us really tricky questions and<br>through that questioning it helps us to<br>think was that very good or this had a<br>small impact but is it enough of that<br>impact collectively we were able to draw<br>out what practices caused acceleration<br>now this was really hard for us all to<br>do at the beginning I heard phrases such<br>as oh it's about spending extra time<br>with that child but the good thing was<br>is because I was in classrooms working<br>alongside teachers and we had leaders<br>having observed in the classrooms that<br>we were able to say ah hang on but this<br>was when you gave some really specific<br>feedback to that child didn't you and<br>that's when we saw the success here so<br>at the start was about supporting and<br>really drawing out for teachers the<br>practices that caused acceleration and<br>we got much better at it teachers were<br>able to just talk about explicit<br>practices we had a whiteboard that was<br>just full of writing of things that<br>worked for our children here and we were<br>able them to generalize those practices<br>and say ah so I wonder if that works<br>also in maths what about in reading hey<br>this child's not accelerating what are<br>you going to try here what haven't you<br>tried from our wall of acceleration and<br>we wanted a clicked of space that we<br>could have a record of our Lunas so that<br>they keep coming back and<br>is there still relevant for us so we've<br>created the space here when we feel like<br>we've got a really good shared<br>understanding of something then we'll<br>create a document this is how things are<br>done but while we are understanding and<br>grappling with these new things we start<br>with sticky notes and we keep coming<br>back to us we have a lot of discussion<br>and a lot of questions because it isn't<br>just about laminating something sticking<br>it up on the wall and saying well that's<br>there done it's about ensuring that we<br>do understand so the ones that are not<br>lemonade are still things that are in<br>the process of being understood and<br>figuring out the plg time gives us that<br>time to go and look at tried and true<br>techniques if one of the children is<br>really struggling teachers are often so<br>busy with so many other things that<br>being given and that support to be able<br>to say aha you could go and look here<br>for this or have you read this is<br>beneficial for my professional<br>development around writing and around up<br>what it should look like in the<br>classroom one of the things that we're<br>really effective was that once we had<br>gone out what practices were effective<br>in accelerating children we were then<br>able to collaboratively sit down<br>together and plan that next week's<br>learning for that child that built a<br>collective responsibility for our<br>children that even though that child's<br>and that teachers class I want to find<br>out how did they go how did they go<br>again and then the following Monday's<br>meeting so hey how did we do we were<br>going to try that did we achieve that<br>how did we go what helps them to achieve<br>that what did you do or what did you<br>need to change in order for that to work</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
