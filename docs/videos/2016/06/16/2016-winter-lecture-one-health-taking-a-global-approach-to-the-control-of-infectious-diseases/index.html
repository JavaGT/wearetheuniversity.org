here a very warm<br>welcome to tonight's winter lecture<br>series event and I would also like to<br>thank Minister Woodhouse on behalf of<br>the university for agreeing to host the<br>2016 winter lecture series<br>the university is honored to again be<br>able to host the series here at<br>Parliament buildings so thank you very<br>much for this opportunity minister<br>this year's series is presented in<br>association with the health research<br>Council of New Zealand as it celebrates<br>its 25th anniversary<br>looking beyond the immense contributions<br>to research funding within the New<br>Zealand Health sector in its 25 years<br>the HRC has played a key role in<br>creating the collective knowledge<br>Network New Zealand needs to be healthy<br>and strong<br>now with that said the University of<br>otago has a long association with the<br>health research Council and many<br>significant research projects have<br>benefited from the funding received from<br>the organization which have in turn<br>enabled otago's Health scientists to<br>take even greater steps in their<br>research endeavors<br>funding received from the health<br>research council is vital to the<br>continuation of the extremely high<br>standards of research that continues to<br>predominate at the University of otago<br>I would now like to introduce the<br>honorable Michael Woodhouse who will<br>Lisa thank you Cura everybody and to<br>those familiar faces in the room welcome<br>back it's my great pleasure to host the<br>2016 University of otago winter lecture<br>series which kicked off so emphatically<br>this time last Wednesday and I know<br>we're going to have a terrific evening<br>tonight continuing what has been so far<br>a health research theme which I think is<br>entirely appropriate because as I said<br>last week<br>I'm unashamedly proud of the work that<br>has undertaken the teaching and the<br>research at the University of otago but<br>I also think we have one of the world's<br>great health science faculties and we<br>probably don't say that often enough but<br>with medicine Dentistry Allied Health<br>Clinical Research into Immunology<br>virology You Name It We Do it pretty<br>well at the University of otago and I<br>think we should continue to say that<br>loud and clear I also want to<br>acknowledge the health research Council<br>the government sees health research as a<br>fundamentally important part of research<br>and Innovation and we're very pleased to<br>be able to give their funding a bit of a<br>boost in budget 2016. as we did in the<br>science and Innovation field more<br>generally<br>before I introduce our speaker for this<br>evening can I just remind you of our<br>emergency procedures if an alarm should<br>go or if security<br>team should ask you to vacate please<br>follow them and the exit signs the<br>Gathering Place for this part of<br>parliament is in front on the uh what<br>you would call the east side of the<br>Parliamentary Precinct by the uh by the<br>sedan statue<br>as you may be aware these lights there<br>are lights behind me on each side of the<br>stage they will flash if we're still<br>going for a short time at 20 past seven<br>and then for a continuous period from 25<br>past to about 7 29 that is the call to<br>the debating chamber for my colleagues<br>and tonight for me because I'm rostered<br>to be in the debating Chamber from 7 30.<br>so I do apologize in advance I I hope to<br>be here to lead question and answers and<br>hopefully different thank you I guess<br>speaker but I won't be able to join you<br>for Refreshments afterwards because of<br>Duty<br>nevertheless uh that will be my loss not<br>yours I'm sure it gives me great<br>pleasure to introduce the second of our<br>winter lecture Series speakers tonight<br>Professor David Murdock Professor<br>Murdoch is based at the University of<br>otago Christchurch Health Campus he's an<br>infectious diseases expert and one of<br>otago's Stellar researchers<br>he's currently head of the Christchurch<br>Health campus's latest<br>departments pathology<br>this department is home to many<br>world-renowned research groups and<br>involved in the teaching of fourth to<br>sixth year sixth year medical students<br>having dedicated 16 years to his work at<br>the Christchurch campus Professor<br>Murdoch has recently been named as the<br>next dean of the University of otago<br>Christchurch campus<br>Professor Murdoch has been involved in<br>some of the most significant infectious<br>disease research projects here and<br>overseas projects include a global<br>childhood pneumonia study funded by The<br>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a<br>new zealand-wide Legionnaires disease<br>surveillance program<br>Professor Murdoch also works for the<br>Canterbury District Health Board as a<br>microbiologist having been a Health<br>Board staff member for more than two<br>decades he's a strong advocate of<br>researchers and organizations working<br>together to achieve greater and mutually<br>beneficial outcomes he's one of the<br>leaders of one Health our Tri which is<br>an alliance between researchers working<br>at the interface between human animal<br>and environmental health<br>his lecture topic this evening is one<br>Health taking a global approach to the<br>control of infectious diseases during<br>which he'll discuss discuss the<br>inextricable link between the health of<br>humans other animals and the environment<br>in the fight against infectious diseases<br>ladies and Gentlemen please welcome<br>Professor David Murdock<br>let's do a sound check I think that's<br>coming through great thank you and and<br>tenakoto katoa and thank you Minister<br>for the for the kind introduction and<br>thank you for coming along tonight I see<br>a few familiar faces including a little<br>bit of fun our support as well<br>I'm an infection doctor what I do my<br>background is I'm trying to look after<br>patients with infectious diseases and<br>also to diagnose infectious diseases<br>in the laboratory as a clinical<br>microbiologist<br>and those of us who are working in<br>infectious diseases we're now faced with<br>um<br>a time where the challenges infectious<br>is we really need to do things a little<br>differently the challenges we're faced<br>with now are relatively new and there's<br>been a real more than ever a need to<br>actually look at things in a slightly<br>different way and tonight I'm going to<br>talk about one of those Concepts which<br>we tend to call one Health it's a little<br>bit of a it's one of those Concepts<br>that's been picked up by a number of<br>groups around the world and in a ways a<br>little bit of the flavor of the month<br>but as one that has it has some currency<br>it's also one that a lot of people when<br>they hear about it go well that's kind<br>of obvious because a lot of it is about<br>a holistic approach to tackling problems<br>in this case the control of infectious<br>diseases and also about working with<br>diverse groups people from different<br>professions so in a way it's kind of<br>obvious but in a way that something in<br>health that we don't always do well<br>now infections are in the media quite a<br>lot and these are just some of the<br>headlines from<br>um some recent Publications we've heard<br>a lot about zika virus recently and the<br>ongoing concern about how that might<br>affect the Olympic Games in Brazil we've<br>heard a lot about influenza over the<br>years and the concerns that we're going<br>to have another nasty pandemic we've<br>also heard a lot about Ebola in this<br>huge outbreak in West Africa that has<br>really shaken Us in terms of the scale<br>of it and then also quite recently a lot<br>of talk about antimicrobial resistance<br>so antibiotics that we've been using to<br>treat infections often are not as<br>effective as they used to be as a lot of<br>the organisms that cause infections<br>develop resistance to them so that's<br>been a big concern that we might be<br>entering an age where a lot of the drugs<br>that we use to treat infections we just<br>don't don't have the same<br>armamentarium as we do at the moment<br>now infectious diseases<br>um<br>and I know we've got a broad audience<br>here and I think that when we're talking<br>about infectious disease we're talking<br>about diseases caused by a variety of<br>microorganisms particularly bacteria and<br>viruses but we also have some infections<br>of humans that are caused by fungi such<br>as the the candida yeast that cause<br>causes thrush and also by some parasites<br>and there's a picture of a Giardia<br>parasite that can cause gastroenteritis<br>another example of a parasite would be<br>the malaria parasite causing malaria<br>and there are a number of features of<br>infectious diseases that make them a<br>little different from other diseases<br>one is the transmissibility here's<br>somebody who's sneezing and imagine if<br>he has a common cold or measles or<br>influenza how easy that would be to<br>transmit it and so a lot it's a<br>characteristic of infectious diseases<br>they can be transmitted some to other<br>people sometimes we acquire infections<br>from animals and I'll be talking about<br>that a little bit tonight and then<br>sometimes we even the other way where<br>animals may get an infection from humans<br>not so we don't talk about that so much<br>um<br>one of the other characteristics is many<br>of the infections have the ability to<br>cause large outbreaks that can have<br>devastating effects on society and on<br>psychological well-being as well so<br>a picture on the left shows there's an<br>old picture of of the plague and in the<br>Middle Ages it certainly had<br>devastating<br>effects on many Societies in Europe and<br>elsewhere and also it's created quite a<br>stigma and a fear in fact when the<br>plague is still around we don't feel<br>that there are a number of reasons why<br>we don't hear about it it's not as<br>common but there's an outbreak in 1994<br>in India you know that was relatively<br>small and we have antibiotics nowadays<br>to treat it the psychological effects<br>were quite marked and some Airlines<br>actually stopped flying into India just<br>because of the small outbreak because of<br>this stigma<br>and this is the the death certificate of<br>my great grandmother<br>she died age 49 in Sheffield in England<br>in 1918 and you can see that the cause<br>was influenza so she was one of many<br>millions of people who died in that<br>Spanish influenza pandemic in 1980 19<br>where there were in fact more people who<br>died of influenza than who died in the<br>first world war which of course it's<br>a lot of infections there's common<br>infections acquired from animals and as<br>I say I'll talk a little bit about that<br>and there are opportunities for<br>prevention for infections and<br>vaccination is one of the more obvious<br>means of prevention and if you get a<br>vaccine that's effective to an infection<br>that's often a very cost effective way<br>of preventing an infection and we've<br>used<br>vaccines also in the attempt to<br>eradicate infections this hasn't<br>happened very often and of course the<br>most well-known example is that of<br>smallpox and that was eradicated<br>declared eradicated in 1980 after a very<br>intense vaccination program that<br>interfered in Civil Wars and other<br>adverse conditions to actually vaccinate<br>the last people and eradicate it and<br>there is actually another human<br>infection we don't we haven't heard a<br>lot about it there are three main<br>strains of polio and polio 3 has<br>probably been eradicated so one of the<br>three strands of pulley that's probably<br>the second human infection that's been<br>eradicated in recent years<br>now my mother's a very fastidious<br>ex-school teacher primary school teacher<br>who kept my plunket book so this is my<br>plunket book and as you can see at the<br>she's written when I had all these<br>infections and childhood now I don't<br>think I'm necessarily that old it's not<br>long that long ago but this as you can<br>see within a a year and a half I had<br>measles chicken pox mumps and whooping<br>cough and that was really common at that<br>time in the mid-1960s just prior to<br>introduction a lot of the vaccines and<br>of course nowadays all four of those<br>infections they're a very effective<br>vaccines and three of them are part of<br>our routine childhood immunization<br>schedule and so for a lot of them we<br>don't see much nowadays we still have<br>occasional outbreaks of of measles and<br>whooping cough and measles particularly<br>in in populations who have not been<br>vaccinated but we tend to forget about<br>the severity of measles and this is in<br>fact a child that I treated about 20<br>years ago in the mountains of Nepal and<br>this child had measles and it was one of<br>the most horrible experiences I've been<br>in that was a measles epidemic the<br>vaccine program had broken down and it<br>and there was an outbreak and this was<br>one of the fortunate child a child who<br>actually managed to get to us with many<br>children who died<br>in in the community and we tend to<br>forget that measles has been one of the<br>large biggest killers of children and<br>still is in many parts of the world<br>and another characteristic of infectious<br>disease is their adaptability and I<br>think probably all the microbes that<br>cause them are very adaptable and one of<br>the more obvious ways that manifesters<br>and the ability to develop resistance to<br>antibiotics and so this has become a<br>real concern<br>um that the pace at which these<br>organisms are developing resistance and<br>the concern that we're not getting new<br>drugs to actually combat them now I'm<br>actually going to talk much more about<br>antibiotic resistance because actually<br>one of my colleagues Greg Cook from<br>Dunedin is going to be talking in the<br>series in a few weeks time just on that<br>topic<br>now in the late 1960s there was a lot of<br>optimism there's a feeling that the<br>vaccines were coming we've been<br>introduced and we're working antibiotics<br>we're still working and this man became<br>famous for this quote and he was the U.S<br>Surgeon General at the time he said it's<br>time to close the book on infectious<br>diseases and declare the war against<br>pestilence one<br>so he was famous because of how wrong he<br>was in fact he went to his grave saying<br>he couldn't remember ever saying it so<br>this is what we remember him for the<br>poor guy because this is of course the<br>how wrong that that is and there's a<br>very complicated graphic but what you<br>can see a man about I read all the words<br>but what it shows<br>is that examples of what we call<br>emerging or re-emerging infections that<br>have occurred over recent years and the<br>blue ones are ones that are newly<br>emerging we didn't know about them<br>before they may have been there we<br>didn't recognize them or they are<br>completely new<br>the ones that are in orange are ones<br>we've known about but have re-emerged we<br>thought they'd gone they'd come back and<br>there's one there which is kind of an<br>aqua which is actually deliberately<br>introduced and that was the anthrax that<br>was introduced in 2001 through the mail<br>in the us but as you can see it's a very<br>busy slide there's a lot going on those<br>of us in infectious disease are not<br>going to be without a without a job<br>during our lifetimes and so there's a<br>lot still happening now we don't have<br>zika virus on there because that slide<br>was made before zika came around and<br>there's another one that's not on there<br>as well and of course that's the Ebola<br>from this recent huge outbreak in West<br>Africa and this has really shaken the<br>world and and Global Health in terms of<br>the magnitude and the response and the<br>required response to this terrible<br>outbreak and this graph if you can read<br>it it shows a lot on it but what you see<br>over time from the 1970s to the present<br>time<br>it shows all the cases of Ebola since it<br>was first discovered in the 1970s and as<br>you can see the numbers are relatively<br>small over time and little outbreaks I<br>mean suddenly in that 2014-15 we get<br>this huge outbreak and mainly focused on<br>three countries in West Africa Guinea<br>Sierra Leone and Liberia<br>and when we look at it the virus seems<br>to be behaving exactly the way it's<br>caused by a virus and it seems to behave<br>exactly the same way as it has in the<br>past and so we suspect what's different<br>is something about human behavior that's<br>made that's been related to the<br>magnitude of this outbreak and probably<br>related to the contact with the animal<br>sources of the virus it may be the way<br>we get much easier to move across<br>borders to move into large Urban centers<br>that hasn't happened before and spread<br>the infection but it's something about<br>human behavior that's probably more than<br>the virus itself that's led to this huge<br>outbreak<br>now the the World Health Organization<br>and others have been majorly criticized<br>for their response to this outbreak<br>being a bit slow or not directed in the<br>right way and in response World Health<br>Organization uh put together this<br>meeting at the end of last year in<br>December and they invited about 100<br>people from around the world and I was<br>one of two<br>um from australasia to come to this<br>meeting the idea being to actually<br>brainstorm and look at ways that perhaps<br>responding to epidemics and actually<br>detecting them in the first place we<br>could do it better<br>and they're health professionals there<br>was there were vets they were there were<br>people there were meteorologists who<br>were good at predicting things the<br>people on the Travel industry there are<br>people from non-governmental<br>organizations and Charities it was a<br>hugely diverse group of people and that<br>basically put us in a room for two days<br>in each given 15-minute slots to talk<br>about designated topics and a lot of<br>time for the chat and it could have been<br>a talk Fest but actually it was a very<br>productive meeting and the minutes were<br>taken by this guy called this Canadian<br>guy called he's a graphic artist called<br>Sam Brad I think is his name and he<br>stood there with his back well everyone<br>was talking and just basically Drew what<br>was happening and here's the so I've got<br>a couple of this is just one of them<br>from one session these fantastic graphic<br>representations of what we talked about<br>and these are really busy slides you<br>probably can't read a lot but you'll get<br>a sense of the kinds of things they're<br>talking about this was the introduction<br>and it talked about<br>diverse groups and the importance of of<br>computer Community empowerment and<br>involving lots of people and decision<br>making and that the old ways are not<br>necessarily the right ways we need to<br>move on and be a bit more Innovative in<br>our thinking<br>and the session that I was involved in<br>again it's a bit hard to see there's a<br>lot of discussion about the human animal<br>interface what the vets were talking<br>about the importance of you know of<br>collaboration and talking with the human<br>health people and in the different<br>systems and types of research and<br>surveillance that was used and vote<br>people involved in the ecosystem so I<br>was really emphasizing the importance of<br>a diverse group of people trying to<br>tackle problems in different ways<br>and the last talk<br>um was by David Navarro and it and it<br>was a very it had a profound influence<br>on me<br>and in fact it'll I must say it also had<br>an influence on me applying for the dean<br>job I must admit I was talking a lot of<br>talk about leadership and<br>sort of the penny drop that week<br>but he David Navarro was the United<br>Nations special Envoy on Ebola and he<br>came from the Paris climate conference<br>just to talk to us at the very end and<br>he sat there and he gave so I'm going to<br>give you 13 Reflections on what I've<br>been through over the last while and<br>here they are I'm not sure if you can<br>see them he said never before have<br>presidents and prime ministers and the<br>media been focused on global Health<br>never before has has there been so so<br>many people really focused on looking<br>for people to say how can you how can<br>you safely get us through some of these<br>challenges<br>he talked about<br>um<br>health professionals needing to have a<br>better narrative needing to actually not<br>just be responsible for providing what<br>we think is the ultimate truth but for<br>actually communicating things in much<br>more digestible way<br>the idea of actually working with groups<br>and not being so siled the idea of that<br>we're we're much more and Broad with<br>nature and the fact that we have to look<br>at the whole environment and the<br>ecosystem we live in to actually address<br>some of the problems the fact that we<br>need to be better at facilitating the<br>um<br>others to do to be we need to be good<br>coordinators we need to show good<br>leadership we need to actually ethically<br>use the power we have to make change in<br>the right way we have to be sensible<br>about using data and not be concerned<br>about hiding it and protecting it and<br>dealing with the ethics involved in that<br>so basically we're saying we really need<br>to look at things in a different way<br>we've got to stop doing what we're doing<br>and you see basically you lot other<br>leaders that will take us through this<br>and um so one of the one of the ways<br>um one of the concepts that has been<br>talked about a lot in terms of this more<br>holistic approach is one that's called<br>one Health and this is often what you<br>see<br>um a diagram like this that involves<br>humans animals and the environment and<br>somehow it's either a Venn diagram with<br>them all circles interrelated or it's<br>arrows like this and there are a lot of<br>different definitions for one one Health<br>is but the basic concept it's the idea<br>of having a more holistic view that will<br>look at animal health look at human<br>health look at the environment that<br>they're living and try and work with<br>people who are dealing with these<br>different areas and to come up with new<br>Solutions not just to infectious<br>diseases but it very much applies to<br>infectious diseases and so this is one<br>definition the health of humans animals<br>and the viability of ecosystems are<br>inextricably linked this is a group<br>called The One Health Initiative have<br>this definition they say one house is<br>dedicated to improving the lives of<br>species human and animals though the<br>through the integration of human<br>medicine veterinary medicine and<br>environmental science it's a bit human<br>and animal focused in the environmental<br>side seems to be tagged on but you kind<br>of get the feeling of what what people<br>are talking about<br>and look to a lot of people this is kind<br>of obvious it's the elephant in the room<br>really you know this is something that<br>actually and to many cultures this is<br>actually just enormous the way health is<br>viewed in a much bigger scale but it's<br>not something that we've always done so<br>well in in the traditional um Health<br>Professions<br>um<br>and many of the many organizations have<br>signed up to one Health principle so<br>pretty much every Public Health<br>Organization in the world talks about<br>one Health and Endeavors to follow the<br>principles and to make things even more<br>confusing<br>is this term Eco Health as well and in<br>fact it's a very similar concept but<br>come about in a different way from<br>different people<br>so this has come about more from social<br>scientists from people involved in in<br>ecosystems and the environment<br>whereas one Health is very much<br>profession driven dominated by vets and<br>doctors<br>but in the end it's probably a very<br>similar concept and there's a belief<br>that actually the two areas are<br>converging quite rapidly and some people<br>choose which one they're talking about<br>depending on the purpose so if you want<br>to work more about social science in the<br>environment you call it Eco Health if<br>you're really talking about getting<br>different professions together might<br>refer to one Health<br>and this paper was written recently<br>they're saying well actually is it just<br>same wine in different bottles<br>um and so<br>if this year there is the first<br>conference that brings people together<br>the first big conference it's in<br>Melbourne and December and there'll be a<br>a very<br>um it'll be a very good meeting that's<br>trying to bring people with these<br>interests together<br>um<br>there are journals on each one and one<br>called equal Health one called one<br>Health now and I've had a very confusion<br>as to all these definitions the one of<br>the themes for Eco health is one Health<br>um so we're pretty much talking about<br>the similar sort of thing this more<br>holistic approach<br>and like everything nowadays there's a<br>day and this is the first time so<br>November 3rd this year it's the first<br>one Health day<br>I think it's the day before World<br>pneumonia day I think as well which is<br>November the 4th so it's you know every<br>day now I think has a disease or<br>something related to health so this is<br>so there'd be activities this year about<br>one Health<br>and just getting back to the logo I<br>think it's something that people<br>struggle with also I'm not sure this is<br>the logo that's right and people change<br>it because it really doesn't put the the<br>environment as a kind of overarching<br>um discipline and I think probably what<br>might be more like is something like<br>this where it's kind of got the<br>environment is is encompassing<br>everything else and then other people<br>fiddle around with other ones and add<br>other Concepts as well but in the end<br>pretty much talking about the same thing<br>it's the idea of having a more holistic<br>approach that takes into account these<br>variables and uses the skills that<br>people have who are expert in these<br>different areas to try and solve some<br>important problems now<br>one thing that's not just about zoonosis<br>now zoonosis are infections of animals<br>that are naturally transmitted to humans<br>and this has been a focus of a lot of<br>one health because it's been dominated<br>by vets and doctors and this is but this<br>is this is definitely not what one<br>Health is all about but this is a it's<br>an important part of it so I'm just<br>going to spend a little bit of time<br>talking about some sort of nurses and<br>show you some examples of them and also<br>through that probably see a ways of<br>which a one health approach looking at<br>the different elements are really<br>important in terms of trying to develop<br>solutions to control some of these<br>infections<br>now there's a whole variety of what we<br>call zoonosis and making the some of the<br>names you may be familiar with but they<br>can be some can be acquired from<br>Wildlife some from food animals through<br>the food chain and some from domestic<br>animals<br>um we tend to focus on The Human Side<br>this this graphic is actually from<br>animal medicines Australia and it has a<br>Veterinary focus and saying there's<br>actually a huge burden of disease<br>of among the animals and and livestock<br>so in terms of the expense in terms of<br>the actual illness itself and the lost<br>productivity and also the expense<br>involved in vaccination as well but we<br>tend to more focus on the human size any<br>of those of us in human health<br>and these figures have been banded<br>around a lot I don't actually know where<br>they come from but I think they're<br>probably reasonably accurate and it's<br>generally thought that about 60 percent<br>of non-human infections have an origin<br>in domestical wild animals and that<br>about 75 of what we call the emerging<br>infectious disease so these are just the<br>ones that have appeared over recent time<br>have some connection to animals and then<br>about 80 percent of the microorganisms<br>at a potential agents of bioterrorism<br>things like Anthrax for example<br>are ones that are often diseases of<br>animals<br>now in New Zealand like so many other<br>countries there is a list of notifiable<br>diseases these are diseases that if<br>they're diagnosed we need to actually<br>let the local public health units know<br>by law and this this is either because<br>it's a it's a disease that you need<br>requires an Urgent Response or it's a<br>disease where it's important to have<br>ongoing surveillance and monitor now you<br>won't be able to read it because I've<br>just taken it directly from one of the<br>Publications but<br>most of them are infections and what<br>I've highlighted there are those in<br>yellow are those that have an animal<br>Link in terms of a zoonosis so as you<br>can see there are quite a few of those<br>notifiable diseases<br>now I'll give you some examples of them<br>and again just to really illustrate<br>the types of areas that are one health<br>approach might be able to address in the<br>phrase now start with a really obvious<br>one and that's it fortunately a disease<br>that we don't have in New Zealand that's<br>rabies but people tend to think of that<br>as as a a typical infection you get from<br>an animal and this is a terrible disease<br>this is caused by a virus<br>it affects can infect many different men<br>probably all mammals we tend to<br>associate more with dogs<br>and when they get infected they be their<br>behavior changes that affects their<br>brain and amongst other things they<br>might have a greater tendency to bite<br>people and therefore transmit the<br>infection and if you get the infection<br>it's invariably fatal so it's a very<br>nasty disease as I say it's a great<br>thing that we don't have it in New<br>Zealand but there are ways to prevent it<br>through dog control through vaccination<br>and through other means<br>influenza is in that one perhaps with<br>something closer to home and influenza<br>has important links to a variety of<br>animals and we particularly think about<br>Birds and pigs and influenza as you're<br>probably aware as a as it was a group of<br>viruses that adapt very quickly they<br>change every year and app create creates<br>a real problem for us when we're trying<br>to develop a vaccine because it's<br>changed and so the vaccine that we have<br>this year may be better against the Vex<br>the virus we had last year than is about<br>the virus we have this year<br>and this Evolution we believe is<br>important stages are when they go<br>through stages and and particular Birds<br>and pigs as well so<br>in terms of the evolution and sometimes<br>the acquisition of these viruses the<br>animals play a very important role and<br>there are other respiratory infections<br>you might remember SARS from about 2002<br>this big outbreak out of this severe<br>acute respiratory syndrome we now know<br>it's due to a virus called a Coronavirus<br>it happened in great secrecy in southern<br>China there was a lot the information<br>took a long time to come out about this<br>mystery disease and then of course it<br>spread to neighboring countries and then<br>through air travel like we probably<br>hadn't seen it before it was trans<br>little epidemics occurred in other<br>places through introduced through<br>Travelers and the one in particular was<br>the large outbreak in Canada<br>particularly in Toronto<br>and we now know that this was a this is<br>a virus that probably has been around<br>for a while it's probably one in these<br>Civic cats in in Asia and bats probably<br>was a naturally transmitted between them<br>and there was something that brought<br>that cycle closer to humans and<br>introduced it into into humans and that<br>spread very rapidly<br>and there's a more recent one called<br>mirth these acronyms appear all the time<br>but this is Middle East Respiratory<br>Syndrome another coronavirus one that's<br>been focused in the Middle East and the<br>cycle it seems to be important among<br>bats and camels so close contact with<br>camels but if introduced into humans it<br>was transmission between humans and this<br>is uh these are where the cases have<br>occurred up up until fairly recently<br>mainly focused on the Middle East but<br>then we had in South Korea this outbreak<br>and this was due to a single traveler<br>who traveled from the Middle East back<br>to South Korea and there were there were<br>issues it's always easy in hindsight to<br>look at the problems but there were<br>clearly issues about border control and<br>recognizing that he was our mother were<br>clearly issues about infection control<br>in the hospital there's a lot of the<br>spread in the cases in South Korea were<br>transmitted among hospital staff and<br>other patients in the hospital where he<br>went<br>so that created a whole lot of problems<br>for us and so it's not just health<br>professionals that involved in this game<br>of trying to control some of these<br>infections<br>Ebola we've talked about and one of the<br>major Lessons Learned From the the<br>recent Ebola outbreak was that the<br>importance of social scientists and the<br>anthropologists and they weren't brought<br>in early enough and the factors to<br>actually convey in a culturally<br>appropriate way some of those important<br>infection control is how to deal with<br>dead bodies in a way that's going to be<br>acceptable and followed because those of<br>infection control measures are vital to<br>controlling Ebola so that that's a major<br>lesson was amongst others was involved<br>that other discipline that was something<br>we hadn't thought about before<br>and this Ebola has an important cycle<br>among animals as well again you can see<br>the Bats Bats feature a lot<br>for a variety of reasons and probably<br>from what we understand the virus has<br>been maintained in very remote areas of<br>Africa maintained and among bats and<br>other mammals like other like primates<br>and then occasionally these outbreaks<br>and humans occur through some contact<br>between humans where the humans encroach<br>on that environment and then spread it<br>back into<br>other communities<br>I have to mention zika<br>and of course this is very topical<br>mainly almost exclusively because of the<br>effect as a disease it's roughly mild<br>disease but because of the effect of<br>pregnant women in the and development of<br>of babies in utero that's really where<br>all the concerns come from and these<br>this is a graph so in the where recent<br>cases of zika infection have occurred<br>and this is Bruce aylward from the World<br>Health Organization shown a map of um of<br>the vine of the mosquito Vector that<br>transmits it so this is a virus that is<br>transmitted by particular mosquitoes and<br>so it's actual where this disease will<br>occur in the world among humans is<br>almost totally determined by where this<br>particular mosquito<br>there's actually more than one but one<br>mainly where it actually lives and this<br>is a map of potentially where zika could<br>spread in the world so it's actually<br>quite a a wide range of areas and again<br>there is the cycle where it's probably<br>maintained in remote areas between other<br>mosquitoes transmitted between<br>particularly other primates and somehow<br>it's jumped across<br>into humans<br>now back to closer to home<br>um just examples of some zoonosis in New<br>Zealand campylobacter is a bacteria or a<br>group of bacteria that cause their<br>illness which can often be very severe<br>it's been particularly common<br>disproportionately common in New Zealand<br>and this is a probably the most commonly<br>reported foodborne disease in New<br>Zealand it's typically associated with<br>meat eating meat or undercooked poultry<br>in particular in milk and empathy and in<br>New Zealand it's been particularly<br>associated with poultry<br>now Michael Baker's in the audience<br>today and Michael has paid a key role in<br>recognizing the increasing incidence<br>through the the past the previous decade<br>of of the incidence of chempalobacter<br>infection in New Zealand and then<br>um<br>rallying and trying to raise the um<br>raise the concern and get in<br>stakeholders interested and responsive<br>to try and<br>eliminate to try and reduce the impact<br>of this infection reduce the instance<br>rate because it reached the alarming<br>levels and it's and there was things<br>that could be done about it and I'm sure<br>Michael's happy to talk at the at length<br>about the problems that he encountered<br>and and the fight he very much laid<br>along with others and in fact this is<br>one of his papers where you can see<br>Nigel French as a as a vet and there are<br>other there's a it was a<br>multi-discipline approach and needed to<br>involve the obviously the the food<br>industry as well that wasn't until a<br>strategy was introduced<br>um that the incidents declined<br>just to mention another one that's<br>related to wildlife in New Zealand can<br>anyone remember all the sparrows dying<br>about 15 16 years ago in New Zealand and<br>this was related to a particular strain<br>of salmonella of course the bit of you<br>know it was worrying at the time people<br>didn't know what it was due to and it<br>was related to this particular strain of<br>salmonella called we called dt-160 and<br>this appeared in is largely transmitted<br>around New Zealand by sparrows and you<br>can see example this photography of a<br>sparrow how it might be transmitted to<br>humans this obvious way that there and<br>it was also a bacterium that eventually<br>um<br>was also introduced into other birds and<br>other and and other farmed animals now<br>I've got a graphql thanks to Nigel<br>French from Mass University this is the<br>data in the face and it's what it's<br>going to show there's a little movie<br>that shows the transmission through the<br>country which we think is largely due to<br>the activity of sparrows and<br>transmitting it and what we see is the<br>blue and the these are all individual<br>cases of salmonella infection and humans<br>that have been reported the blue and the<br>purple the ones that we've seen for a<br>long time that come up every so often in<br>this bright green one is this particular<br>strain the dt-160 and what you'll see is<br>that start around Christchurch in the<br>south island and very rapidly spread to<br>the north island and if the graphic<br>and then become established after a<br>while this is over about nine years has<br>a very common cause started to the<br>decline after about 2011 although it's<br>still around but as you can see very<br>another one I'm going to mention because<br>it's an occupational<br>infection in fact it's the most common<br>occupation the acquired infection in the<br>museums that's called leptospirosis and<br>this is a bacterial infection due to<br>this<br>leptospirobacteria which has this very<br>it's a spiral shaped bacteria<br>and it causes quite a nasty infection<br>with fever and headaches and can have<br>some nasty complications and this is one<br>that for most of the world<br>is actually one with is associated with<br>rodents<br>and rodents become infected they will<br>pass it in the urine and it's actually<br>exposure to the urine either when they<br>the urine is in the water source that<br>get people are exposed to or more<br>directly<br>and that's we think it we are humans are<br>quiet because they have a cut and they'd<br>be exposed to get through a cut or it<br>gets in their eyes and there are other<br>animals but it's the rodents that with<br>think of it the association most<br>strongly but actually in New Zealand<br>it's quite different it's actually in<br>some of our livestock<br>sheep cattle and so those at most risk<br>of acquiring it this viruses so those<br>who are exposed occupationally so<br>freezing workers<br>and<br>and Dairy Farmers and it's quite easy to<br>see with this fantastic New Zealand<br>inventions of milking sheds how if a cow<br>decides to pee how it might someone<br>might acquire<br>leptospirosis that comes out nicely at<br>and the Vets are very keen to eradicate<br>this so there's a lot there's a major<br>efforts in terms of vaccinating animals<br>and trying to to<br>minimize the impact of this infection<br>which is under recognized in this<br>country even though we know it is the<br>most common occupationally acquired<br>infection<br>now as I say it's not just about<br>zoonosis and I'd sort of talk about<br>another one which is something that I've<br>spent a lot of time thinking about as<br>Legionnaire season this is one where<br>they Associate's more of the<br>environmental side of things and<br>Legionnaires disease is a type of<br>pneumonia caused by specific bacteria we<br>call Legionella or group of bacteria and<br>it's often quite a nasty pneumonia it's<br>one we tend to associate with water we<br>think of it in terms of the water and<br>cooling towers and these outbreaks that<br>have happened all around the world where<br>there's been a suddenly a lot of cases<br>where people have been exposed to air<br>conditioning in a hotel through the<br>infected cooling tower or it's a spa<br>pool that's become infected and that<br>happens in New Zealand as commonly as it<br>does anywhere in the world but we also<br>have<br>the majority of cases it has another<br>risk factor and that's gardening and<br>this is uh due to a species<br>that is different a little different<br>called Leach now long beachy and this is<br>one that likes to live in soil<br>conditions and and compost in particular<br>and so we've demonstrated that the<br>exposure to compost and potting mix is a<br>particular risk factor and so here in<br>terms of trying to control the disease<br>we need to think about how to minimize<br>that exposure and of course this is a<br>very healthy activity gardening and only<br>a small proportion of people actually<br>become unwell with Legionnaires disease<br>so we really need to look at ways that<br>we can keep people gardening that can<br>protect them and that may be ways of<br>looking at how we can make the potting<br>mix in particular<br>safe if that's possible it might not be<br>possible or look at ways that we can<br>actually<br>advise people about how to handle<br>potting mix and this is actually the<br>current Ministry of Health<br>recommendations about how to handle<br>potting mix and some of the things like<br>wearing masks I mean you know how many<br>gardeners are happy to wear masks<br>there's not many so I think these have<br>been followed with variable rigor but<br>anyway it's something that this ongoing<br>work about and interestingly one of our<br>recent studies showed there might be an<br>association with with pets although<br>that's something we're exploring a bit<br>more closely so I won't talk about that<br>but there's it's interesting from point<br>of view of there have been associations<br>we haven't thought we hadn't previously<br>thought about<br>and in Canterbury we're hearing a lot<br>about the issues with dairy conversions<br>and the potential effects on the<br>waterways the potential effects on<br>Animal Health the potential effects on<br>human health and this is a a very as a<br>wonderful area that could have a one<br>health approach because at the moment we<br>have a lot of people concerned from<br>different sectors people interested in<br>water quality people interested in human<br>health there's not necessarily a lot of<br>talk between the groups but a lot of<br>concern a lot of very focused activity<br>and it's and so here's a situation we're<br>actually getting together and trying to<br>collect get good data<br>see with where the problems lie and how<br>we might be able to solve these problems<br>is actually imperative and certainly at<br>the moment I don't think I think we're<br>all looking for the narrowly at what the<br>problems might be and I think having the<br>more broader approach will actually get<br>the right sort of answers but this has<br>become as you might be aware of very<br>very hot topic in Canterbury at the<br>moment<br>and uh antibiotic resistance I'm not<br>going to mention much as I said before<br>but just to say there is a animal<br>connection<br>as antibiotics are used by humans and<br>overuse promotes resistance antibiotics<br>also used in the veterinary field and<br>often as a kind of growth promoter as<br>well and in fact New Zealand is an<br>interesting situation at the moment<br>where we actually<br>compared to other countries use a lot<br>more antibiotics than humans than other<br>countries we kind of think ourselves as<br>being kind of good but we're actually<br>not<br>whereas in animals we use a lot less<br>than other countries and this is an<br>interesting Association that's something<br>that has changed and there is a real<br>effort among the veterinary Association<br>to actually minimize the use of<br>antibiotics particularly as a routine<br>and the maintenance of health of of<br>livestock in fact there are plans to<br>abolish them all together for that<br>purpose by 2030.<br>so we have to move a lot further along<br>on the human health side as well<br>now what about New Zealand and is there<br>an opportunity for us working a bit more<br>along our one Healthline New Zealand I<br>think this is very obvious that yes<br>there is a lot of people a lot of people<br>interested in infectious diseases it<br>benefits the health of humans and<br>animals are also our primary produce and<br>our in our economy there are a lot of<br>reasons why we should be working a bit<br>more closely together not just<br>infectious disease but obviously that's<br>my focus and I think infectious disease<br>in particular lends itself to this very<br>well and so a group of us are trying to<br>develop this initiative we call it one<br>half hour to a row it's it's early days<br>and its foundation is collaboration<br>between Messi and otago and I should say<br>for start<br>that's not exclusive we're a lot of<br>other organizations and Crown research<br>institutes and other universities are<br>involved but the core has really been<br>the collaboration and I I put Nigel<br>French here who couldn't make it tonight<br>Nigel's a a vet and a professor from the<br>vet school at Massey and he is he is my<br>main partner in crime with this<br>initiative<br>um but we what we have in New Zealand<br>one vet school and it's a fantastic vet<br>school it has a fantastic International<br>reputation we have two medical schools<br>which are fantastic but they're all at<br>different universities and although<br>there are interactions there's probably<br>not as as much as they should be and<br>probably allows you related to the<br>distance so we're trying to rectify that<br>with a collaboration between the vet<br>school at Massey and otago medical<br>school<br>what we're trying to do is just get an<br>alliance of health professionals and<br>other disciplines all the interest in<br>infectious diseases and try and work<br>together to<br>answer some of these address some of the<br>the problems we're facing with<br>infectious diseases<br>and following the typical one Health<br>principles are aiming to attain optimum<br>health for people domestic animals<br>wildlife in the environment but I think<br>more importantly it's the kind of<br>holistic approach<br>um in providing opportunities for us to<br>discuss problems and to meet and to<br>develop as as the need arises for<br>collaborations and particularly focused<br>around research but not exclusively I<br>think it's a major leadership and<br>advocacy role as well<br>and the values we've talked about it to<br>have a commitment to the one Health<br>principles they have reactive<br>participation from the various groups<br>and positive engagement with<br>stakeholders and a lot of stakeholders<br>and it's actually more than positive<br>engagements actually involving<br>stakeholders that's probably a better<br>way to put it<br>um<br>making a difference doing things that<br>are actually going to have an impact and<br>and affect policy in the end be very<br>responsive that's the one thing about<br>infectious diseases things happen<br>unpredictably and so to actually be<br>nimble and be responsive I think that's<br>important to have a group of people who<br>know each other and can say well<br>actually this is where the expertise<br>lies and we can react in this way<br>um and I personally a Global Perspective<br>you can't really understand infectious<br>diseases properly without having a<br>global perspectives they don't they<br>ignore Bound for international<br>boundaries and and we need to know what<br>happens elsewhere but I think this is<br>something that we also have a lot to do<br>with New Zealand but I think we also<br>have a lot to offer on a world stage as<br>well there's a lot of expertise in this<br>country and we don't always in this<br>country have good leadership in<br>infectious diseases and I think here we<br>have a an opportunity to actually in a<br>constructive way show that leadership<br>in research and advocacy and training<br>and then also I think International<br>Leadership potentially as well<br>and sorts of things we're looking at is<br>just the opportunities to connect to<br>develop networks and collaborations<br>encouraging Innovation and an education<br>element as well now if we needed any<br>indication about<br>whether there's any interest in this Co<br>in the country it was from this meet we<br>have run two symposia the most recent<br>one uh uh was in March they've both been<br>in Wellington purposely so we engaged<br>for his government agencies and within a<br>short space of time we had nearly 200<br>people from 43 different institutions<br>come along talk about a wide variety of<br>aspects all relating to infectious<br>diseases from different angles and it<br>was an incredibly positive<br>meeting the networking opportunities<br>were were huge and that really blew us<br>away the response to this so this is<br>something we're very keen to run<br>hopefully it's an annual event and I<br>think maybe we'll take the opportunity<br>perhaps to engage politicians as well in<br>this in terms of always having it in<br>Wellington and getting keep people to<br>come along and present in front of the<br>group<br>and talking about the international<br>stuff I just mentioned one project and<br>this is a project with the acronym Hazel<br>it's based in tanzan there it's from the<br>from UK but it has some key people from<br>New Zealand and so John Crump<br>from Tiger medical school and Nigel<br>French from Massey vetri School the key<br>players in this project which is looking<br>at<br>zoonotic infections in Tanzania within<br>the um the livestock and meat pathway so<br>new zealanders as we tend to do get<br>involved in a lot of international<br>projects and here here is one example<br>and also on the education side Massey<br>have done some amazing things they<br>they've received funding from European<br>community and the World Bank to do<br>education training in South Asia on one<br>Health and epidemiology<br>among health professional human health<br>professionals and Veterinary<br>professionals key people people who have<br>influence in these countries the Future<br>Leaders in these countries in these<br>areas and they've run a program I've<br>trained to Master's level which has been<br>by all accounts enormously successful<br>and they have this cohort of of<br>ex-students throughout South Asian now<br>who are very very who know about New<br>Zealand the very strong supporters of<br>New Zealand particularly Massey for what<br>they've done and I had the opportunity<br>to meet a whole of the students in<br>Kathmandu earlier this year and some of<br>the brightest students I've encountered<br>anywhere these are people who are really<br>going to make a difference in their home<br>country there was Three Vets and one<br>doctor and one scientist who have been<br>trained in a very practical way and they<br>were going back they already had jobs<br>within the service within the government<br>many within the government and they were<br>making a difference and he was you know<br>a good example of what you know New<br>Zealand can offer and you know Massey is<br>a very special place they even have<br>their own time zone so this is in the<br>the work room in Kathmandu they<br>obviously work a lot at distance and so<br>they had Nepal time and messy time<br>and I'm just going to finally mention<br>um something else and it's something<br>that I feel very strongly about because<br>it's you know we often about global<br>Health as well and one Health and you<br>can get confused but Global Health<br>something I feel very strongly about and<br>we have<br>um<br>a a recent initiative which was started<br>in Christchurch<br>which we as a pilot which was actually<br>getting our medical students to work<br>real time with medical students in Nepal<br>and in fact we've also started in summer<br>as well without discussing cases with<br>each other that each bring from each<br>other's country so this is what they're<br>doing here of our teleconference with<br>with four places our students in<br>Christchurch who are on a pediatric run<br>and they're talking to students and and<br>and and four rural locations in in Nepal<br>and presenting cases where our students<br>were seeing the sorts of cases that we<br>wouldn't normally see in New Zealand<br>then they were learnings both ways and<br>this is a based around a true<br>partnership and a bi-directional<br>learning experience which we're trying<br>out and and we're hoping that this will<br>we call it Global Health classroom and<br>and we hope it's going to expand to<br>other areas but there's already interest<br>from the vet school in Massey to look at<br>actually how that can be done because<br>they have connections with Sri Lanka and<br>other places and actually how we can<br>combine the two and so we have the vets<br>and the Medics working together so you<br>know with with technology we can do a<br>lot more than we the time zones we can't<br>change and we can just manage this one<br>but um the technology is helping us do<br>this so I'm going to finish there<br>um I I you always come to problems with<br>acknowledgments because of the people<br>you miss out but I am going to a lot I<br>haven't and so I apologize for that but<br>what I have to acknowledge some people<br>and this is a core group who have been<br>involved many from Messi and otago<br>um to really get things going at the<br>moment and particularly with the<br>Symposium and other initiatives so just<br>to acknowledge them and apologize to<br>many huge number of others have shown<br>immense support for this initiative so<br>I'm very happy to to answer any<br>questions<br>David Thank you Lisa has a microphone so<br>if you do have questions please<br>introduce yourself and and direct them<br>I've got a specific little question<br>about Legionella and gardening<br>um I'm very good about putting on my<br>mask and gloves when I'm doing potting<br>mix and stuff but tend to be completely<br>the opposite when I'm up in the garden<br>pottering around<br>um is it promoted by somewhat anaerobic<br>conditions as in a plastic bag or should<br>I really have my mask on when I'm up at<br>my raised veggie bed yeah very good<br>question and and you wouldn't believe<br>how much we still don't know so if I<br>can't answer your question about the the<br>growing conditions and whether having a<br>bag out in the sun or it's been sitting<br>in there and in the Urban Garden Center<br>in a certain place for a certain amount<br>of time because we are trying to address<br>those questions at the moment but I can<br>answer them for you immediately what we<br>do know is that the compost is a is a<br>definitely is an exposure it is a risk<br>and we kind of knew that but actually<br>the definitive Studies have well defined<br>the bit good evidence of any is only<br>recently appeared and some of that work<br>we've done in Christchurch but<br>um we weren't able to show conclusively<br>about masks and gloves but that may be a<br>problem with the study itself so we<br>still think that's a good idea the one<br>thing that I do think is good and has<br>come out is washing your hands<br>so when you're handing potting mix do<br>wash your hands afterwards and that's<br>probably that's something as part of the<br>current recommendations but that's<br>something that we've found even that's<br>come out quite strongly that things<br>where your hand comes to your mouth<br>provides an opportunity for it to be<br>introduced so we're hoping to find out<br>some more information about the answer<br>some of these other more detailed<br>questions<br>but that's what the recommendations at<br>Professor Murdoch I was really<br>interested in your outline of one Health<br>ayatiaroy and how the veterinary and<br>medical sector are working together and<br>especially on a global<br>basis the Civic issue that I'm<br>interested in you made reference earlier<br>in your presentation to a goal<br>which you hope to achieve in 2030 was<br>that relating to lessening the amount of<br>antibiotics which are used<br>with by the medic by the veterinary<br>profession to promote<br>improved animal growth and the<br>consequential effect of that on<br>antibiotic resistance is that what is<br>absolutely so that's the New Zealand<br>Veterinary Association have done that<br>and that may surprise you to know that<br>um I mean obviously you know that a lot<br>of antibiotics are used in the<br>veterinary world as kind of growth<br>promoters as kind of thought to be<br>related to the well-being of of<br>livestock and so it's not just given to<br>treat an infection it's kind of given<br>routinely in some places<br>and that's been a major Focus because<br>the amount of antibiotics used and<br>that's in some sectors around the world<br>is this huge industrial quantities<br>and so that has been a major focus in<br>different parts of the world and so the<br>veterinary Association New Zealand has<br>really uh<br>been part of a process reduce that and<br>that's that's the rain by 2030 to have<br>none at all at the moment they've<br>reduced it considerably so such that in<br>New Zealand it's a lot less than a lot<br>of other countries but that's exactly<br>you hiking from that huh<br>yeah hacking on for Margaret's question<br>about the engineers I uh for years<br>always bars in them stuff so can one<br>accidentally incidentally immunize<br>yourself against it that's a very good<br>question and and you know we very rarely<br>see it among people who actually work<br>with it you know people who are in those<br>factories that produce it and the<br>companies of course say well it's<br>because we have they all wear masks and<br>we look after our staff really really<br>well<br>um and that may be right but it's also<br>intriguing because these people are<br>exposed to large amounts so I can't<br>answer your question but we ask that all<br>the time and so we're actually trying<br>also trying to think of ways that we<br>might be able to look at that and it<br>might be that you do you get exposed to<br>low you know amounts over a long period<br>of time and that you're able to develop<br>some immunity but at the moment we don't<br>know<br>could you tell me inside in some<br>countries some GPS may be forced to give<br>antibiotics for a mild cold in case they<br>get sued and I just wonder if there's<br>any pressure put on them to give them<br>antibiotic<br>there's enormous pressure put on GPS<br>I don't think in this country there's so<br>much the issue about<br>litigation other countries for sure<br>um but there are pressures and it's<br>particularly from the patients or the<br>parents<br>that's probably where some of the<br>greater pressures are or or just the<br>feeling like it is something you can do<br>and so with a with a common cold or<br>something where we think it's a virus<br>causing the infection where antibiotics<br>don't work the right right answer is<br>usually not to prescribe antibiotics but<br>it can be sometimes with the pressure to<br>do something so their GPS do find the<br>pressure and that is a major focus of<br>ways to get around that and to help out<br>in terms of what we call antibiotic<br>stewardship where we're trying to at the<br>more appropriate use of antibiotics and<br>so that involves a lot of public<br>education as well reducing the<br>expectation from people about getting<br>antibiotics but it's a very real effect<br>but probably not litigation so much in<br>uh I'm one of the vets that you've been<br>talking about<br>um however<br>would you like to pass a comment or do<br>you have any concerns about<br>um New Zealand's enthusiasm and<br>increasing enthusiasm to be willing to<br>um well of course I can't really condone<br>unpasteurize more um I mean that is the<br>standard I would have I mean I think<br>there is a there's a very good reason to<br>have to pasteurize milk and you know I<br>wow<br>yeah I actually have one last question<br>as well and it it kind of segues on from<br>last week we had a long discussion<br>around the nature nurture arguments with<br>Professor poulton around the social<br>determinants of<br>um of health and and other<br>um Behavior<br>and I looked at that map around the<br>incidence of infection and death in the<br>Ebola outbreak two years ago<br>to what degree is there a genetic<br>predisposition to the resistance of or<br>susceptibility to viruses like Ebola and<br>what do we know about how we can develop<br>an inherent resistance because it does<br>seem as though the<br>mortality<br>rates were random I mean what what do we<br>know in science about about sort of<br>genetic predecision predisposition we we<br>do know that there are some infections<br>where I mean there are there survivors<br>you know and HIV was one where people<br>there were people who seem to be despite<br>incredible<br>um exposure they seem to not require HIV<br>infection but it's also a lot of<br>interest in the survivors of Ebola for<br>sure<br>and so um<br>there are infections where there are<br>clear indications that there is a<br>genetic component and believe me there<br>are a lot of a lot of work at the moment<br>looking at those Ebola survivors so<br>we'll we're going to fight there will be<br>some information coming out but there<br>probably are some host factors usually<br>as a combination<br>you know so there are some most factors<br>certainly<br>I think that underscores the fact that<br>while uh there's much we do know there's<br>still a lot that we will learn and and I<br>think that's going to be thanks to<br>Fantastic researchers like yourself and<br>others at the University of otago so on<br>your behalf can I ask you to join me in<br>foreign</p></main><footer
