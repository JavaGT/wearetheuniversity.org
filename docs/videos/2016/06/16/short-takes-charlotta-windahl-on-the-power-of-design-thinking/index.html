font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>design thinking is a methodology let's<br>useful for companies wanting to think<br>outside their business as usual approach<br>and possibly address so-called wicked or<br>complex problems in order to disrupt<br>their business or perhaps their industry<br>it really is nothing new in terms of<br>tools and methodology industrial<br>designers have used this for years what<br>is a bit new is that companies have<br>started realizing that they can use<br>design thinking for more than just<br>product design traditionally many<br>companies focus on the feasibility and<br>the possibilities of the product<br>basically this is what you know we've<br>got this amazing product look what we<br>can do now we need to push it to the<br>market and some companies also focus on<br>the viability so how can we really sign<br>the business model win win contracts<br>performance optimization etc how can we<br>get paid for that and make it<br>financially viable what Design Thinking<br>does is is literally to say that okay<br>let's put that to the side a bit and<br>start with the desirability and start by<br>really understanding the latent and<br>unarticulated needs of the customers and<br>their behavior so it's really about<br>gaining deep empathy for what goes on<br>with the customer customer and the user<br>experience and and Design Thinking<br>starts their sodas I'm thinking almost<br>forces companies to think beyond<br>products and services because it puts<br>the human experience in focus rather<br>than the tangible offering an example of<br>design thinking in action is fisher &amp;<br>paykel healthcare some years ago and<br>they developed something called optic<br>optic flow juno which is a oxygen mask<br>for neonatal babies the traditional<br>approach to this would have been to just<br>take an adult-sized mask and make it<br>smaller for the babies in fact that's<br>what was kind of lived back then on the<br>market instead what they did<br>was that they they walked in and they<br>they shared old gnosis they did empathy<br>interviews with gnosis they prototype<br>and iterated and newest very iterative<br>design thinking approach to trying to<br>understand and what these shows the pain<br>points the opportunity areas were within<br>this product and what they could do to<br>help basically develop facilitate<br>neonatal care so an example from the<br>services industry would be a new zealand<br>they use the same thinking methodology<br>throughout the organization an<br>interesting example is the development<br>of the new interior of the planes and<br>this resulted in the sky catch together<br>with a wrench of new services and i<br>think this is the first time that but<br>where an air line actually develops its<br>in-house this involved setting up a<br>resize prototype of the interior of the<br>plane down in were caught they called it<br>hang on line it was done in the viaduct<br>here in Auckland and they brought in<br>actors to act out the experience of<br>being on a long-haul flight in order to<br>gain insight around the new the<br>prototypes of the head developed I<br>believe there are three crucial<br>components for a company to successfully<br>implement or work with the same thinking<br>methodology curiosity being curious is<br>key to be able to identify insights and<br>opportunities creativity a company needs<br>to embrace creative neutrals and use<br>multi-discipline attempts to solve<br>problems encouraged so companies need to<br>be prepared to fail and to learn from</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
