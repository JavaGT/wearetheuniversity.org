font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>this has been our third year as part of<br>the áall program we wanted to make sure<br>that the practices were spread right<br>across our school we had a wonderful<br>reading called coloring the white spaces<br>the purpose of that was to really make<br>us think about deep-seated assumptions<br>and beliefs that we might have and how<br>those assumptions and those beliefs<br>might affect our relationships with one<br>another our relationships with children<br>and then how those relationships and<br>those beliefs then affect our practices<br>we had some pretty challenging talk<br>around that but we then collectively<br>came up with a set of shared beliefs<br>that I wanted everybody in the school to<br>be able to say does that align with what<br>it is that we believe here it becomes a<br>collective way of being a collective way<br>of thinking for leaving and valuing you<br>know good readers are good writers but<br>also in the modeling and the shearing<br>was their peers as well we're so lucky<br>at the school that everyone is so<br>supportive of each other that we know<br>that feedback it's not always positive<br>but it's always critical feedback that<br>is relevant and it's going to support<br>your teaching that starts with a key<br>belief that every child can and every<br>child will learn in this environment<br>it's about us forming an effective<br>relationship with that child so they<br>show us what they know it's our job as<br>professionals here to really get to the<br>crux of what it is that that child needs<br>to be able to learn and part of that is<br>knowing our learners knowing our<br>literacy practices and knowing the next<br>steps for their child in knowing next<br>steps for us you may be supported that<br>with a little bit more than you know if<br>I'm not doing something that's helping<br>that child to learn what do I have to do<br>next to support that next step<br>being a group of eight or nine teachers<br>we can pull an every single person's<br>strengths if there's a puzzle that we've<br>stuck on or if there's some reading that<br>we think we should do I've very<br>purposely positioned myself as a learner<br>alongside everybody sometimes I sit and<br>let other people do the talking but it<br>was about making sure that I was reading<br>the readings with the teachers<br>the discussions and I was the lunar in<br>that classroom alongside those teachers<br>as well and I very much positioned<br>myself that I make mistakes I'm the<br>biggest and the biggest mistake maker in<br>this school and that's about learning<br>from it together as enough creating that<br>culture will we do have strengths and we<br>do have things that we're working on an<br>order for us to improve we all have to<br>improve and support each other to be</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
