Conrad Pilditch thinks it does. The Biological Sciences professor specialises in the processes that influence the structure and function of soft-sediment communities – in other words, a butterfly effect of how large changes can occur as a result of small actions.<br><br>At his Inaugural Professorial Lecture on 21 May, Professor Pilditch will discussed his current research on soft sediments, and why we should care about them. “Basically, if you value clean water, productive fisheries and collecting kaimoana, you should care about soft sediments,” he says.<br><br>The Inaugural Professorial Lecture Series at the University of Waikato introduces our newest professors to the community and gives them a chance to demonstrate how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.

join me in<br>welcoming to the lectern to deliver his<br>inaugural professorial lecture professor<br>okay I'm thinking this equivalent if you<br>do vice-chancellor Elsa Jones is Chad<br>Europe dean of the faculty science and<br>engineering friends and family thank you<br>for coming along tonight on the shortest<br>day of the year and I promise this will<br>not be the longest lecture of the year<br>I'm so in the last couple of weeks I've<br>fielded a lot of interest about the<br>title to my talk ecology and marine<br>sediments why soft bottoms matter so all<br>will be revealed tonight so what<br>actually spark was this idea of the<br>title of this talk was a car turning<br>that i found when looking through the<br>new yorker and it depicts a group of<br>ladies sitting around having tea and<br>once is the other i don't know why i<br>don't care about the bottom of the ocean<br>but i don't and so having spent here in<br>20 years studying the bottom of the<br>ocean i was a little bit perturbed by<br>this because these systems are important<br>and they do have value and we should<br>care about them so that's going to be a<br>topic of my talk today so if we take a<br>little less human view of the world will<br>see that most of our planet is blue the<br>pacific ocean that we see up here covers<br>about a third the surface of the globe<br>the oceans themselves covered nearly<br>seventy-five percent so three quarters<br>of the surface of our planet is covered<br>by oceans and water and almost in on<br>those seed beads like the sediments and<br>washed off the continents composed from<br>the skeletal remains of the animals in<br>the ocean and it is by far the single<br>largest most ubiquitous habitat and the<br>plant so it's important so no matter<br>where you go there are soft sentiments<br>everywhere if you go from the<br>Antarctica's and the soft sediment<br>communities they're very very diverse<br>community of shellfish starfish and<br>animals that inhabit the settlement to<br>the tropical oceans the dugong is<br>feeding here on the on the seagrass<br>communities soft sediments are<br>everywhere the deep-sea environments<br>down here are several thousand<br>because is lovely crinoids and that are<br>there on the CB and then to our coastal<br>habitats and the intertidal here is<br>where we must contact with so the soft<br>sediments that lie beneath their oceans<br>are everywhere they Harbor probably the<br>most of the undiscovered biodiversity on<br>the planet and they carry out important<br>functions but why don't people care<br>about the soft bit it's because they<br>don't link the processes and those<br>sediments to what they value from the<br>coast of systems so if you value as part<br>of your ecosystem clean water for<br>swimming and coastal habitats productive<br>fisheries being able to go out and catch<br>snapper enjoying watching seabirds or<br>gathering home alone oh then you should<br>be interested about what's happening in<br>these soft sediment communities because<br>the processes that are occurring in<br>there the interactions between the<br>animals and plants underpin the things<br>that we value from these ecosystems but<br>it wasn't always like this if we go back<br>to what the seabed look like some 540<br>million years ago it was a very very<br>different story in the Garden of Eden<br>kara we had microbial mats that<br>dominated the sediments these thick mats<br>made up of microbial communities kept<br>off the settlement there was no exchange<br>of water there was very little exchange<br>of nutrients between the sediments and<br>the overlying woodcock the only animals<br>grazing these communities were surface<br>grazers max scratches left leap off the<br>microbial mats there for me there's a<br>very toxic environment does a lot of<br>hydrogen sulfide produced by these<br>bacterial mats that's the right next now<br>that you get and muddy sediments very<br>poisonous to animals that need oxygen<br>then 540 million years ago things began<br>to change does an explosion of<br>biodiversity occurring in these<br>settlements and it was driven by their<br>advent of predation so other animals<br>moving across the settlement surface<br>eating is max structures drove the<br>evolution of a community that<br>again that began to barrel into these<br>scenes and that changed everything soon<br>as is microbial mats were broken down<br>and the burrowing activity of these<br>animals began to function exchange could<br>occur between them a water column and<br>the sediments the sediments became<br>oxygenated and that fundamentally<br>changed the bacteria that live in these<br>sediments and the processes that they<br>mediate so a lot of what we look at<br>today is dependent on the processes<br>occurring in these settlements and this<br>happened 500 years ago so if we move in<br>fast forward to today seabed it's a very<br>different story the species have changed<br>they've evolved the things that we're<br>familiar with shellfish worms and<br>crustaceans that burrow into these<br>sentiments but they're still carrying<br>out a very very similar role introducing<br>oxygen into these sediments they're<br>affecting the microbial communities that<br>are there and they have a fundamental<br>role in how these systems function and<br>the connectivity to the overlying the<br>water column so this is going to be<br>about as complicated as my toolkits<br>tonight I hope and there's just a couple<br>of things I want you remember from this<br>firstly at the sediments and the water<br>column are intimately mixed you can't<br>think about the water column and shallow<br>coastal environments without thinking<br>about the processes that are carrying in<br>sediments what happens in the<br>settlements and these coastal<br>settlements is that organic matter dead<br>plant material dead animals settle down<br>to these sediments the microbial<br>communities in these settlements break<br>down the stair and decaying organic<br>matter and by doing so they release<br>essential nutrients that support the<br>primary production and the water column<br>and under sediment the park community<br>that everything depends on so these<br>settlements because is it these<br>sediments regenerate the nutrients that<br>fuel the production and in coastal<br>environments about eighty percent of the<br>nutrients needed to sustain the plants<br>have come out of the settlements and<br>into the water call so what the activity<br>of what happens in these sediments<br>supports the primary production which<br>the risks of food<br>depends upon there's also another key<br>feature about these sediments they have<br>a very special via geochemistry and the<br>surface layers there's oxygen prison<br>what's so fast now of course a little<br>internal dooley that I'll go back here<br>we go they have oxygen present than<br>these surface layers and in these deeper<br>layers is an absence of oxygen and the<br>special biogeochemistry facilitates<br>microbial communities that have to have<br>the capacity to remove excess nutrients<br>in particular nitrogen so nitrogen in a<br>bioavailable form stimulates client<br>production if there's too much nitrogen<br>you get too much prior production and<br>you lead towards you JK shin and massive<br>algal blooms but the communities and the<br>cinnamon have a capacity and resilience<br>to burn off some of that nitrogen and it<br>depends on maintaining this oxic layer<br>and thus anoxic layer very close to each<br>other to allow the bacteria to remove<br>some of the spire available nitrogen<br>that fuels primary production and<br>convert it into nitrogen gas which is a<br>nerd and unavailable so these sentiments<br>carry out an intricate processing of<br>dead organic matter releasing nutrients<br>of fuel production they also have the<br>capacity to shift a little bit off to<br>the side and various them arrive as<br>unavailable nitrogen and this is<br>provides resilience against excess<br>nutrient so I guess what drives me and<br>what makes me want to study science so<br>I've always been interested in how<br>things work and I want to know how these<br>animals and typically led to their<br>environment and how these processes are<br>changing the supply of nutrients the<br>water column or burning off some of<br>these excess nutrients I also want to<br>know if we're losing animals from the<br>settlements and we're in the midst of a<br>global biodiversity crisis at the moment<br>where species of they're coming to<br>expect at rates that have never been<br>seen before since a meteorite smashing<br>the<br>and potentially wiped out with dynasties<br>that is of course but we're losing these<br>species so what are the consequences of<br>the species likes with changes in<br>biodiversity to how these soft<br>settlement systems function remember<br>their functionality is critical to the<br>things that we value from these coastal<br>habitats so this is these kinds of<br>questions are very very important in a<br>changing landscape in a changing world<br>and we're seeing things change over long<br>periods of time and other very quick<br>periods of time so globally the two<br>larger stresses in the coastal ocean are<br>settlements and nutrients and using on<br>really really good at delivering lots of<br>sediments into the coastal have coastal<br>environment we occupy about point 05 of<br>the sink of the land area on the globe<br>but we contribute over to the scene of<br>the terrestrial dry sediments than to<br>the coastal habitats now part of that is<br>related to geography we're in a westerly<br>wind belt that delivers a lot of rain<br>part of that's the doojoo geology we<br>have mountainous regions and volcanic<br>soils which you write very readily and<br>part of its due to the narrower long<br>shape of New Zealand which means when it<br>rains there's very short steep<br>catchments which deliver settlements to<br>the coast soon after its raining there's<br>no lakes to check that so this<br>represents humans have greatly<br>accelerated those rates of delivery in<br>two hundred years we've seen our<br>landscape change in Northland from virus<br>carry forests and kathia forest to a<br>predominantly pastoral landscape and<br>urban areas as well so these factors<br>these changes in land use have greatly<br>accelerated a natural process and<br>delivered lots and lots of settlements<br>into the system and these sentiments<br>cause stress on the soft sediment<br>communities not talk about how that<br>works in a minute the other big stressor<br>of course is the bigger increase of<br>intensification of agriculture happening<br>globally as we want more meat production<br>and a new zealand we've seen a tripling<br>of Cour densities for example over the<br>last 20 years or so we need more<br>nutrients and fertilisers to support the<br>grass to feed the cow<br>and we're starting to see some of the<br>deterioration in our lakes and rivers<br>associated with this intensification<br>those sediments those nutrients are on<br>their way to the coast and in systems<br>where the integrity of the sediments has<br>been compromised and the ability to<br>process nutrients has been lost leads to<br>state changes and very undesirable<br>outcomes this photograph that you see at<br>the bottom right as I'm can doubt which<br>was where the Olympic Beijing Olympic<br>your team do new works very very large<br>macro algal bloom associated with excess<br>nutrients that are coming into the<br>system so how do I go about during the<br>research well there's two main<br>approaches that have sort of driven on<br>how we've worked over the last 15 years<br>or so one is about understanding the<br>natural history okay what animals do how<br>do they behave how they function what<br>role are they playing in these systems<br>for understanding what these animals are<br>doing in the sediment how they're all<br>truly oxygen conditions how they're<br>processing the nutrients gives us more<br>information on what we can think about<br>if we lose their species from the system<br>the other key aspect to what i do is<br>empirical field research this means<br>going outside and working in natural<br>environments so what i want to do today<br>with the rest of the talk is give you<br>three examples of the type of research<br>that we've been conducting over the last<br>sort of five or six years or so as kind<br>of benchmarks with different sorts of<br>work research that we do and why it's<br>important so the three examples are<br>changing functional role of species<br>Muddy Waters and then why biodiversity<br>is important to resilience so the first<br>work is some work that hazel enum did as<br>a PhD student working with me and<br>colleagues at Neela looking at the<br>functional role of crabs everyone knows<br>what a crab is you've done in history<br>that bite your toes and run away<br>screaming but they call me burroughs<br>this is Australia's crecer and so common<br>mud crab go to sandy beach go to muddy<br>history these will be very very numerous<br>so what austra healers crecer does with<br>a burrow and mud crab<br>forms barrels as you might expect and<br>you can see the evidence of this bar is<br>on the same way so what hazel did as<br>part of our research was spent a summer<br>for encircled resin wax down holders to<br>see what the architecture of those<br>barriers were underneath the settlement<br>and this was an example of one of the<br>barriers excavated from Tyra history an<br>incredibly complex and to elect series<br>of Votto burrows that extended over tens<br>of centimeters and width and down to<br>about 30 centimeters deep in the city<br>this is the lungs of the settlement that<br>increases the surface area these burrows<br>are irrigated bringing in fresh water<br>and oxygen and that's stimulating in<br>microbial communities to turn over and<br>regenerate those nutrients faster and<br>faster so we thought right Krabs borough<br>builders Bob the Borobudur and this is<br>the role that they are signed and just<br>about every study let me look at them<br>crab things abarrach through a berry<br>builder they carry out certain functions<br>but what we are able to do is have a<br>look at what happens in Sandy sediment<br>and when the borough is born in sandy<br>sediments they clapped after a type they<br>just fall in on themselves they're not<br>consolidated and these various persist<br>for maybe a day or so in many sediments<br>there's intricately linked burrows<br>persist for weeks for months at a time<br>so the species form is doing a very very<br>different role as you move from a muddy<br>settlement adhesive sticky mud up tMI's<br>to a nice sandy settlement where you can<br>walk across the same thing they've got<br>some can very much at all and in the<br>muddy sediments their 4-0 builders and<br>the sandia settlements they're mixing<br>the sediments down to 50 60 centimeters<br>continually forming burrows and flexing<br>were able to show that had real<br>important differences for the role that<br>the crowd was planning in terms of how<br>to speed back into the primary<br>production and how this feedback into<br>nutrients this kind of research is<br>important because a lot of research now<br>is assessing functional diversity what<br>the animals do in see the most and they<br>assume they carry out a certain role and<br>if their present comes with that certain<br>functions now if the role of this animal<br>and environment is changing then those<br>assumptions<br>wrong and how we manage biodiversity the<br>second study I want to talk a little bit<br>as related to the last one because it's<br>about muddying the waters we've talked<br>about sediment inputs as a stressor and<br>after every time rain sorry this isn't<br>particularly clear but the rivers become<br>muddy and delivers fine silt clay to our<br>coastal habitats eventually the cities<br>to the bottom and has incorporated into<br>the sediment over time if we deliver an<br>athame the history shuts from sand flats<br>into mud flats and you've all<br>experienced that if you're walking life<br>certainly had a muddy patch up to your<br>knees and mud very smelly hard to get<br>out and then go on to the same things<br>again in a future world where we<br>continue to pump in large amounts of<br>sediments into our coastal habitats we<br>will shut histories from saying clean<br>sand wet environments and to maria<br>habitats so what might the spiritual<br>world look like so obviously we can't<br>move forward 50 years a hundred years of<br>poor land management practice to find<br>out but we can substitute space for time<br>we can go into our existing histories<br>and with long sedimentary gradients<br>where it's muddy and where it's andy and<br>look at what happens so what does happen<br>if we have a look at these two graphs<br>here and I promises as mother's<br>numerator going to get today across the<br>bottom as mud content from 0 to 30<br>percent hard xan-tu up to your knees and<br>muck that's the gradient okay and I've<br>got of two measures of diversity of<br>animals that live in the cinema one is<br>the number of species and the other is<br>Kalman until we had and the take-home<br>message for that says as we've increased<br>my content the d'oeuvre diversity the<br>number of macro foreign species are<br>number of species cheering up the<br>settlement and doing things and<br>processing nutrients declines the<br>abundance of those animals also the<br>clients so as we move to a future world<br>with Walmart we're going to have less<br>diversity of species and we're going to<br>have less numbers of species in this<br>settlement as well so what does this<br>mean for ecosystem<br>will the ecosystems function the same<br>will we get the same amount of primary<br>production at sports the shellfish<br>reports the snapper that we like to<br>catch well unfortunately not this is two<br>measures of ecosystem function from this<br>particular study again we've got our<br>same gray via of very low mud content to<br>our very sticky mud on the same plants<br>and on the left-hand graph is a measure<br>of nutrient processing this is the<br>inorganic nutrients that are coming out<br>of the settlement and to the work on<br>that's fueling the plants and what do we<br>see we see a steady decline a nutrient<br>processing capacity there's less<br>nutrients available to support the<br>primary production and in the second<br>graph here got our made content gradient<br>again we've got a measure of how much<br>permanent reduction is appearing in the<br>sediments this is by the microscopic<br>plants live right on the settlement<br>surface and these microscopic plants in<br>coastal environments and sediments<br>provide about eight hundred ninety<br>percent of the primary production for<br>the animals that are in these Eastern<br>habitats and what do we see we see a<br>strong decline in the amount of primary<br>production associated with this<br>increasing mode conti this is impart due<br>to the loss of species as mud increases<br>as in part due to the changing<br>characteristics of the settlement where<br>they become less permeable and things<br>don't move across the sediment water<br>interface in the same way so future<br>world with lots of mud could be a very<br>different place to what we have to<br>tackle so the last thing I'd like to<br>talk about is some very very recent work<br>around biodiversity and resilience and<br>this is related to some we're currently<br>underway with colleagues a new work and<br>and the University open so in this top<br>graphic top petrol are looking at here<br>is a stretch of the copra same thing and<br>the Kuiper just north of Auckland on the<br>west coast is the largest history in the<br>southern hemisphere apart from the land<br>use changes it's still a relatively<br>pristine condition so this is a what<br>looks like a relatively homogeneous seen<br>that there doesn't appear to be much<br>change going on across it it's about a<br>kilometer and a half between the<br>high-tide mark<br>in the low tide bag if we go out there<br>and map and find out what species are<br>prisoner in the settlement we get a very<br>very different picture so what we're<br>looking at here is a cross-section<br>across the beach starting here and<br>heading towards the ocean this is a<br>kilometer and then it's 300 meters why<br>so we were now and ecology involves<br>taking a lot of cause a lot of surveying<br>and a lot of idea but what we observed<br>and the darker the colors in this heat<br>map represents an increase in abundance<br>so there's some 112 species on the same<br>thing what about 40 of them are<br>important to processing nutrients they<br>max sediments they create burrows they<br>pump water down into the sediments and<br>do things and oxygenate settlements and<br>stimulate microbial communities so you<br>can see this areas on the shore that<br>have high abundance of these nutrient<br>processing species those wet dots<br>represent the number of species that we<br>have so the larger the black dot the<br>more nutrient process in which species<br>we have that back at the color the end<br>more numbers of these species so as we<br>can see this nutrient processing<br>capacity across the same facts not<br>uniform there's hot spots of activity<br>potentially because there's more<br>nutrient processing species of higher<br>diversity so our question is if we<br>stress the system what happens if we're<br>going into a future world we're adding<br>more more nutrients to these systems how<br>does a system respond what happens in<br>the system doesn't diversity in the<br>system provide resilience to change can<br>we maintain nutrient processing by<br>stressing the system if we've got a<br>diverse and healthy community the way in<br>which we did this and a lot of my<br>researchers the students and<br>collaborators will know involves buckets<br>and spades we were now onto the sand<br>plant at these 28 sites marked by those<br>white squares and we carried out at the<br>numbers of field experiment we added<br>fertilizer to the sediments and we added<br>a to dos tres we added a little bit of<br>fertilizer and then we added a lot okay<br>we've set it up before Christmas and we<br>came back several months later and we're<br>interested in a measure of nutrient<br>processing capacity and this measure is<br>related<br>how well the sediment rd nitrifying<br>nitrogen basically taking that bio<br>available nitrogen through into nitrogen<br>gas that can't be used by the plant<br>community pipeline community and this is<br>critical for into a unified system if<br>the seabed can convert those excess<br>nutrients into nitrogen gas we can<br>revert pond out and necro algal blooms<br>so what did we find well when we added a<br>little bit of nutrients the whole story<br>came down to one species it's a species<br>here Makka mona lily are many here will<br>Cena is the weed shell that's very very<br>common in histories it grows up to 2 to<br>3 centimeters in size and looks about 10<br>to 15 centimeters at that if you walk it<br>across the sand flea and you see what<br>looks like bird footprints these are the<br>feeding activities of this particular<br>enemy there's a long siphon that comes<br>up and it sucks up the sediment and then<br>this is the exhale and siphon where the<br>excess water and the sediment it has put<br>out so what we found was at sites that<br>had good densities of macaroni liliana<br>nutrient processing was maintained and<br>the denitrification activity was<br>maintained and no settlements had a good<br>ability to get rid of those excess<br>nutrients and we know why this occurs<br>because it would be interested in the<br>natural history of this animal so this<br>represents some work that was done with<br>some collaborators from the United<br>States at University of South Carolina<br>and involved taking these animals into<br>the lab and putting a very very high<br>resolution pressure sensor next month<br>and what you can see in this particular<br>time series over an hour is these<br>periods of high pressure low pressure<br>high pressure low pressure and high<br>pressure what this represents is the<br>animal pressurizing the sentiments they<br>take in water at the surface they bring<br>it down their process the food on the<br>guild and then they eject water now this<br>exhaling cipher is normally here at it<br>so it's pumping oxygenated water down<br>deep into these sediments and this is<br>the critical part about how facilitates<br>nutrient processing so what we're having<br>a look out here<br>as a as a side view through the sediment<br>water interface is a false color image<br>but it's showing you the distribution of<br>oxygen and you can see above the water<br>column there's plenty of oxygen yellows<br>and reds and then this is a cinnamon<br>order interface and then this is the<br>cinnamon beneath it there's some trials<br>taken from three species which<br>essentially can do the same thing so<br>what happens with these animals so if<br>you focus here on these purple blobs<br>that are occurring here this is the<br>oxygenated water that's coming out of<br>the exhaling cycle of these animals<br>active that oxygenated water facilitates<br>to microbial community and that makes<br>them more efficient at getting rid of<br>nutrients and converting them to into<br>gas while they are pressurizing the<br>cinnamon it's a little difficult to see<br>but you'll see these plumes of the<br>oxygenated water coming up out of the<br>sediment into the work on that<br>deoxygenated water that oxygen has all<br>the nutrients in so these animals and<br>the settlements are literally flashing<br>the settlements out through pressurizing<br>the cinema they're also facilitating the<br>microbial community to be better at<br>denitrification so what happens when you<br>add a lot of nutrients we add a lot of<br>nutrients so biodiversity matter but it<br>wasn't this particular key species<br>because what happened when we added a<br>lot of nutrients that basically wiped<br>out the mecca my own community so<br>overall the settlements ability to<br>process nitrogen or severely impaired<br>because they've lost those key species<br>nevertheless sites that had lots of<br>different animals lots of nutrient<br>processes in it still had a positive<br>effect and provided some resilience or<br>some ability to process those nutrients<br>so biodiversity manners and different<br>elements of biodiversity matter when the<br>system is under low stress and winners<br>under high stress okay so what does all<br>this mean let's take a step back so<br>we're living in New Zealand we have<br>relatively lack of movement is<br>relatively pristine histories with<br>healthy seagrass communities<br>cinema and we can end up like many<br>harbors and histories than Europe and<br>North America and these money method and<br>these muddy messes that had low<br>diversity and low ecosystem values to<br>most of society so we are we along this<br>continuum well question is we don't<br>really know but we do know from our<br>research that the biodiversity Hannah<br>means that you have any settlements<br>provides resilience to change so I'd<br>like to use this little ball model in<br>terms of describing ecosystem state and<br>transitions between different states<br>sands Mac muds that healthy ecosystem<br>necro algal blooms so when the<br>ecosystems healthy the system can be<br>prepared you can knock this ball you can<br>add a flush of nutrients and the system<br>will continue to function and won't<br>change into another state you need to<br>give it a pretty good nudge to get it<br>down to some sort of altered state now<br>what happens when we start reducing by<br>debussy we start stressing the system as<br>this hub and this epic this resilience<br>to change begins to be a writer so when<br>we have a reduction in the abundance of<br>shellfish in our harbors we begin to add<br>you mad that's got some species out<br>we're beginning to arrive this<br>resilience to change climate change<br>temperature stresses nutrient pulses<br>sediment coming in all begin to be a<br>rover way until eventually you might<br>hear a very small perturbation to move<br>it into an altered state and then we<br>could end up right down here in this<br>degraded state where to restore an<br>ecosystem is incredibly difficult and<br>hard to do so the question is where we<br>along a spectrum the answer is we<br>probably don't really know we're<br>probably not here in this original state<br>we've seen changes in our histories and<br>harbors associated with increase in<br>sediments and nutrients and we're<br>certainly not down at this modern state<br>year in these places as well so the big<br>questions become as what do we need to<br>move<br>system how sensitive are various systems<br>just tapping into alternate States how<br>does the interaction between increasing<br>nutrients and increasing mud content in<br>settlements or Odette resilience so<br>today we and most researchers globally<br>have been only focused on one stressor<br>at a time some provides our world we<br>deal with settlements we go into a<br>settlement study we do a nutrients we go<br>into a nutrient study what we don't do<br>is think about well what are the<br>combined effects of these two stresses<br>if we add sediment then we probably<br>degraded the biodiversity of it as<br>though see them as warm prior to a<br>tipping point or shifting into more tuna<br>to date and this is a focus of our<br>research coming up as part of the stone<br>disease challenge we have a large<br>program where we're going to be going<br>out into estrus throughout the country<br>adding nutrients to settlements again<br>but combining this with turbidity stress<br>and light stress in mud pointing and<br>involves a cast of thousands but will be<br>coming to an history near you hopefully<br>so this is what's this is where we're<br>heading in the future to understand them<br>and what's happening in the new zealand<br>landscape is that on man we're managing<br>often for one stressor we're managing<br>for nutrient loading you can only have<br>thus much nutrients going into a river<br>or thus much sediment and secondly we're<br>not thinking about the downstream<br>effects so what might be good for one<br>string one river by the time you apply<br>that over the entire catchment the<br>cumulative effects downstream in the<br>receiving environments in our harbors of<br>history's could be quite catastrophic<br>and we need to get this right not only<br>managing for our future and sit in these<br>limits and understanding of how these<br>ecosystems work but these ecosystems are<br>connected by over vast differences and<br>like to finish with this little example<br>here of the migrating God works we all<br>enjoy these birds in our histories and<br>harbors that just left in March their<br>journey up through Asia to their<br>breeding grounds and then the last end<br>they'll be reaching Alaska around about<br>this time of the year and then in<br>September they'll be back down into New<br>Zealand to feed on the same flex at<br>Miranda in the fifth<br>into example so management decisions we<br>are making here whether Esther's are<br>becoming more degrading will affect the<br>food supply of these birds it will<br>determine their success of reaching<br>Alaska and their breeding success once<br>they get there so these ecosystems are<br>connected over very very large distances<br>not managing just for ourselves or<br>understanding just breath cells it<br>connected over very very large<br>differences okay I think that's better<br>so obviously what I presented today<br>there's work of graduate students and<br>colleagues and I've been phenomenally<br>lucky on over the last 12 for some<br>wonderful students even will give<br>resemble one of them I've learned an<br>immense amount from and I'm not going to<br>name them like children County favorite<br>but you know who you are I'm the day the<br>technical support in particular i'm doug<br>labelle and peter Jarmo and the<br>electrons workshop have been phenomenal<br>and none of this would have been<br>possible without them a great team<br>collaborator Simon thrash Judy hood<br>newer drew vara and Carolyn one quest<br>and our colleagues overseas alphaville<br>co selling wouldn't date with E and<br>particular thanks I think deserves to go<br>to the School of Science in the<br>University of Waikato and Alan green<br>field pointing someone who never had a<br>PhD I promise I'll get it done so I<br>appreciate that and they've allowed me<br>to be and supported me with equipment<br>and facilities that are second to none<br>and I really appreciate that fund us of<br>course Marsden in be Regional Council<br>sports companies etc finally are my<br>family that's product with me the most<br>and that I thank you all and I like<br>leaving that slide most people are in<br>cura ladies and gentlemen tena koutou<br>katoa it's my task to summer and thank<br>Conrad for what has been a wonderful<br>talk tonight's was a compelling case for<br>why we should care about one of the most<br>ubiquitous environments on the planet<br>soft bottoms yeah as an aspiring marine<br>scientist growing up in California I<br>fondly recall the opportunities I had to<br>learn about marine biodiversity I also<br>recall that I enjoyed the rugged open<br>Coast the rocky shoreline I avoided soft<br>sediments at every opportunity largely<br>because I never mastered that<br>opportunity to walk on mud instead I<br>always had that sinking feeling which<br>makes working in these environments a<br>particular challenge and in fact<br>undertaking research in these<br>environments a very compelling case<br>Conrad you've shared the questions that<br>drive you and the extent to which land<br>use alters coastal function and created<br>a sense of urgency with the audience and<br>certainly in the New Zealand context<br>you've replaced butterflies with<br>bivalves and hurricanes with shorebirds<br>which is quite an act we appreciate the<br>contributions are making here at the<br>University of Waikato and to the New<br>Zealand science community I'd like to<br>you all to join me in thanking Conrad<br>for his talk tonight and sharing those<br>those elements and join us in the foyer<br>to ask those pressing questions about<br>soft bottoms that I'm sure you've all<br>saved up please join me in thanking<br>comrade</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
