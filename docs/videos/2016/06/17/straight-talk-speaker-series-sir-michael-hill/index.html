1979 in his hometown of Whangarei in northern New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I'm reading through the books I made<br>a number of notes on index cards and one<br>of my colleagues who's here this evening<br>said I haven't seen notes on index cards<br>in a number of years so there's there's<br>too many things I'd like to ask you this<br>evening but I'll start with one of the<br>quotable quotes that I liked in your<br>book which said that sales is a series<br>of seductions so I'd like for you to<br>talk to us a little bit about the<br>seduction process sales in general<br>retail what you think is the process of<br>seduction thank you Kevin<br>well it's a big question and I'm going<br>to give you a long answer unfortunately<br>because that's what we're here for<br>okay when I reluctantly joined my<br>uncle's jewelry business in Whangarei as<br>a salesman my father who was an<br>Electrolux salesman was my coach and the<br>jewelry business was made up of people<br>that usually were doing what your<br>jewelry is and my father was sort of<br>outside the box so rather than being<br>more interested in repairing the piece<br>of jewelry or the watch my father was<br>more interested in making a sale and<br>having to sell vacuum cleaners<br>Electrolux vacuum cleaners during the<br>Depression he had to be pretty good at<br>what he was doing because he'd knock on<br>the door and if his opening remark<br>wasn't sufficiently good at it be<br>slammed and it would close in his face<br>but he quickly learned to put his foot<br>in the door and could talk himself in<br>and he had ten steps of a sale that<br>stood me and very good it really made me<br>quite strong and because I was a young<br>boy with no expectations I really didn't<br>know where I wanted to go<br>I didn't believe I'd amount to anything<br>I stood there and listened to my dad for<br>23 years selling and but those steps are<br>still with me and then when we started<br>their own jewelry business we took them<br>to the next stage I guess really and<br>selling as a real art it's basically a<br>lost art and in in retail and it's funny<br>you go to these great firms like<br>Louboutin and Cartier and Tiffany's and<br>the salesmanship is because the<br>product sells itself because of the<br>manner of the hazards built up by the<br>founder and because we didn't quite come<br>from that we had to sell ourselves and<br>we have a system now that was based on<br>the American Freedman system which means<br>that every sales associate has to<br>achieve certain results in a week you<br>can't be a drone in one of our shops if<br>your drone you get a red dot so in other<br>words how it works is that if you<br>achieve the target your is sit for the<br>week you get a gold star if you achieve<br>only last year's figures you get a black<br>dot and if you don't achieve either of<br>those you get a black dot a red dot at<br>least and the red dot stands out very<br>clearly so every week your figures and<br>your dots are showing in the back office<br>on a little tiny wall and they're<br>showing and every sales associate has<br>space and everybody sees them and at the<br>end of the month you either get the same<br>you get the gold you get the black goo<br>you get the the red dot for the month<br>and then all those each month are then<br>whacked onto a big board in a head<br>office and you can see all the shops and<br>in it it it takes a percentage of<br>everything and the shop either gets the<br>red or the black or the gold for the<br>month and of course the red ones stand<br>out like measles are the ones that need<br>attention you see so they do get more<br>attention so so this the system works<br>like this that if you're<br>to red dot then we need to give you more<br>training and in the training becomes<br>more intense and the system is quite<br>complex but quite simple and the art of<br>selling is a stage is a lot of stages<br>before I leave the Freedmen's system<br>which we have slightly changed your on<br>the items per sale per hour the number<br>of add-ons you make in that sale and the<br>average sale you make and usually you<br>will find that if there's a weakness<br>it's going to sharpen one of those of<br>what they're not doing the best way to<br>train people in selling is to reenact to<br>sell once it's happened so the secret is<br>that if the shop is not busy and if it's<br>quite easy to see how the tip the shops<br>going<br>you can stand outside and if somebody's<br>in that shop and everybody's focused on<br>them even though the pretending to do<br>something else you know they're engaged<br>but if you look there and somebody's<br>selling say a ring here and the others<br>are polishing some jewelry and having a<br>chat over here and this one's not taking<br>a bit of notice you know the thing's not<br>working at all so in a roleplay you<br>reenact the sale whether it's made or<br>not and analyze it to death so everybody<br>turns around they walk we all have<br> the whole pack the whole selling<br>teams there and then we reenact up to<br>degree of even how they walked in the<br>door who came in if there's a couple who<br>came in first because the first one is<br>usually the buyer the second say hang on<br>you you you learn all these things which<br>window that it looked the window on the<br>left that they went on the right it was<br>the one on the on the on the left it's<br>the diamond rings on that on the other<br>side it isn't the pins on the Kuster<br>blows it's quite complex so when they<br>come and you have to be aware of<br>everything has happened where they came<br>to<br>counter what was the opening mark who<br>say I think anybody in our companies it<br>says how's your day been<br>and those inane questions that seem to<br>be like I've been came be under the lift<br>the other day at 5:00 in the morning<br>how's your day been so far I got a shock<br>like fellow I mean really it was that<br>now there's a bloody stupid comments we<br>don't want those sort of comments<br>we want proper comment so you've got to<br>come from the heart you've got to think<br>of something original this came to spark<br>a conversation if you can't do anything<br>at least give a nice smile and a wave<br>that you recognize them and it may be<br>all that's needed because you see when a<br>customer or appear coming to the shop<br>they can easily be spooked it's a bit<br>like duck shooting which is on at the<br>moment you can be in your my my and you<br>can see the Ducks come up and you can<br>stand up and bang and of course the<br>whole lot have gone straight away and<br>it's exactly the same and selling in the<br>shop so if you're on the wrong position<br>in the shop you're at a huge<br>disadvantage if you're out the back part<br>of the shop and you have to walk up to<br>the customer you all go to spook them<br>nearly a hundred percent of the time and<br>they're probably going to turn around or<br>either do a quick exit and they've gone<br>and you've lost them so what you have to<br>do in a situation like that is you have<br>to get like a some books or the broom or<br>something and walk straight past them<br>and get on the selling get on the<br>outside of them so they they it's a<br>little difficult from to get out but<br>if it's the same aesthetic flounder you<br>know you can you can you can nip your<br>flower you can have the more than the<br>bloody nip tea if you don't put a hook<br>in it and and and stop them the cinder<br>all go at the end so it's it's exactly<br>the same so so any out they you you you<br>get on the other side of them and then<br>you busy away and then you might just<br>give them a smile or something or and<br>then you could start up a conversation<br>that's the very difficult path is doing<br>the conversation without spooking it's<br>quite difficult but once we've done that<br>and then we find out what they're in<br>there for nicely and we it's all quite<br>relaxed we ask them what they're in<br>there for and and discover the situation<br>or the occasion and then we work through<br>the whole process and then we come to<br>the showing of the item it's very<br>important the showing of any item no<br>matter what you're selling is it's a<br>very important part so we have a little<br>stage a little little thing that goes on<br>the counter that goes under the light<br>and it's it's an ice cream display stand<br>there it's it's it's it's there and we<br>get the ring out and we hold it and we<br>disguise the ticket we hold the ring out<br>very carefully and we have a salvat and<br>just like a magician on the stage we put<br>that over the top and give it a slight<br>clean take it off and hand it to the<br>customer now the customer has to pick it<br>up because if a customer picks it up<br>they never get to buy it so we think<br>they hold it and we then we put it on<br>the finger for them so they put it on<br>the finger the weak salesperson at this<br>time is rattling off that this is an 18<br>karat gold it's got one carat diamond as<br>a VBS color there that's right and it's<br>got a small occlusion on the side sittin<br>18 carat guns they got these side<br>diamonds either we've got sixty very<br>thin to get on and on and on I agree to<br>the leadership you should not say<br>anything you wait for the reaction<br>because we don't know what the reactions<br>got to be is good or bad whether for the<br>reaction is it is good we can start<br>speaking slowly should never mention the<br>price to list the customer who is<br>irrelevant well is the coz where if they<br>don't mention the price to never get a<br>ride it is the<br>no interest for many hell so on these<br>goes and they've got all these steps<br>that carry on and then you get the<br>customer you will do you know they we<br>have a several items out when you've got<br>one that's out to say after about three<br>times it seems to have come back to one<br>item we then box the product and one of<br>our beautiful new pink boxes so we put<br>it in that beautiful box with a lid open<br>or looking at them beautifully in the<br>box there this is what you call a trial<br>clothes some must say what are you doing<br>that for you see so I mean it's can<br>sometimes get a reaction if not it's<br>standing there beautifully while we're<br>showing the other products if something<br>else was better we didn't swap it over<br>and put that in there and there's this<br>questioning goes on it's all fun little<br>they're all having fun and see if this<br>is no pressure in this incident and then<br>you get people to differ a lot of people<br>do it they just can not make their mind<br>up you know I mean a lot of people can't<br>make the mind about ending in bloody<br>life any of it we have to deal with it<br>so I used to have an interesting I'm<br>close if there's a couple of in the end<br>is a there's a guy who they always feel<br>awkward the men on the shot because in<br>New Zealand and Australia is different<br>than in North America but here the woman<br>actually knows where the ring is<br>she's done by home work generally and<br>she takes him into the shop so he's led<br>in and he's feeling very awkward to be<br>here but he know this the scenery's it's<br>game to get engaged so he's got to go<br>through this agony and he's standing<br>there and she's trying all these on and<br>it's in the box and everything's looking<br>in you get a sort of a sense after a<br>while that it's possibly the right ring<br>and I find it's got a nice and it is<br>Sammy Stanley and I say Sam this is one<br>hell of a day for you and a very special<br>occasion a remarkable day in fact I said<br>I picked the ring up I give it to my<br>thing and I get her head and I said I<br>well I tell you what if it's right the<br>ring goes on and there's a kiss and a<br>hug and that's it if it's wrong there's<br>an instant reaction she'll pull back a<br>finger and then listen because this is<br>where it smokes out the objection which<br>we want to hear well I saw one on the<br>other shop which I'm going to try it<br>again or it might be nice what I said or<br>there'll be something it will tell you<br>what's going on that all the truth comes<br>out so this is the wind wink and then we<br>can dig in deep and we can we can we can<br>erase that problem and then people say<br>well I'm going to able to look around<br>and have a cup of tea they've been<br>saying that for 40 years since I've been<br>but that's that's a sign that you can<br>actually then start selling because then<br>you need to do a 360 and find something<br>totally different they're looking at<br>because you're looking at a ruby cluster<br>and it's all ahead in mine but suddenly<br>you show them a solitaire or one of my<br>new Signature Collection with a little<br>things separate on the side and they<br>fall in love with something totally<br>different so the customer really doesn't<br>know until they try something on so<br>there's all these things that we go over<br>and then when you made the sale you give<br>them a card you give me a name you take<br>you take it for your on the internet so<br>you've got there for future occasions<br>and on it goes<br>so when you do the when the when the you<br>do the roleplay<br>everyone packs around and we think of<br>all the things could we have done<br>anything better in this whole<br>presentation you know you could have a<br>customer and she could ever a shopping<br>bag full of groceries it's heavy on her<br>arm she's trying I mean how ridiculous<br>that so we've got to free that up from<br>it if we can set a customer down<br>we're going back to seats it is this a<br>significant once you've got a person in<br>a seat you've got them far better<br>position than standing up they become<br>very comfortable and secure in it and<br>any enjoy the experience but without<br>going any further in it the great sale<br>makes a great customer for life a poor<br>sale could force one sale and we'll<br>never see them again which is<br>shocking and an insignificant sale is<br>just a ho-hum thing like you get most<br>weird so we have the opportunity to make<br>a customer and a friend for life I have<br>made so many friends when I was selling<br>it was such an amazing experience to<br>have people come in with pikelets and<br>cream cakes and pike boats for morning<br>sea and afternoon sea and come and see<br>us at lunchtime and it was just so much<br>fun and at one grade shop when we<br>started off there and we we we took that<br>the turnover from 225 to 1.3 million<br>which was which was the national level<br>dress 200 then sir it was it was amazing<br>times so selling is the lost skill and<br>at Michael Hill we still teach selling<br>as our main our main principle of and<br>anyone who starts in the business needs<br>to be able to sell so if any of you ever<br>wanted to join us you have to you have<br>to start by learning the basics of the<br>business on how to sell before you can<br>climb up the ladder and may I say the<br>ladders pretty pretty big now because<br>we've got so much expectation I'm<br>I don't think you're talking too much as<br>a matter of fact I want to compliment<br>you it's the first time in my experience<br>that out of the gate we've called the<br>audience ducks and flounders and I have<br>this visual of the male ducks and<br>flounders in agony so thanks for that<br>visual but but on that topic of agony in<br>our earlier conversations you talked<br>about your life is sort of a volume 1<br>volume 2 and the volume 1 included some<br>agony and out of that sort of was the<br>catharsis of volume 2<br>talk to us a little bit about it's a<br>funny thing isn't it really in life that<br>I mean my life is so extraordinary it's<br>ridiculous to think that for 40 years I<br>couldn't see out I couldn't see anything<br>and there was a bloody disaster and then<br>I have a house for I lose everything<br>except my children and my wife and it<br>changed me overnight and it's a funny<br>thing really though that heaven<br>experienced some awful times or<br>reasonably awful not that bad really if<br>you haven't experienced some toughness<br>or hardness I think it's very hard to<br>move upwards or onwards and one of the<br>fears I have and one of the things I'm<br>here tonight for is to perhaps tell you<br>that you live in the most wonderful<br>place I think in the world here in New<br>Zealand<br>we're privileged to be here but the one<br>thing you have to watch is it is<br>slightly easier than anywhere else as<br>well you may not think so but it is<br>actually and because of that we<br>sometimes don't need to challenge<br>yourself or push ourselves to achieve<br>your true full potential and you settle<br>something like else so I had forgotten<br>what the damn question was now is about<br>adversity all right okay so I tried the<br>gold sitting I mean I'd read Dale<br>Carnegie or what nightingale and I read<br>all the books and listen to all the<br>tapes and I tried to go sit and I<br>couldn't I really just couldn't do it<br>but as soon as we had the house fire and<br>I stood there that night watching<br>everything I had go and I already had<br>nothing else but the house which was<br>insured but not properly insured and<br>that night I said I was came to write on<br>a piece of paper I was getting around<br>because business all started in<br>opposition because I've never had the<br>guts to do anything like doing fault<br>because I didn't think I could do it so<br>it was just a fear factor but that<br>pushed me to do it and you see when I<br>was at school Jack Glanville told me<br>that I would never be anything in life<br>he was the deputy head of one great boys<br>high school a maths teacher and I was<br>Rogers<br>and he was the I was the worst math<br>students in that year and I was pretty<br>bad and took 403 but troubles I was<br>bullied at school you see and I couldn't<br>concentrate on any damn thing really and<br>I couldn't wait to get us school quick<br>enough and I wanted to be a concert<br>violinist and 18 months of that but you<br>know I was my uncle put me into the<br>family business because they thought I<br>shouldn't be playing the violin it was<br>probably the right thing actually<br>looking there but<br>yeah but I really couldn't see out and<br>then after the house fire<br>I just couldn't see anything but a<br>future and I started gold sitting so I<br>had a I had a that we would have first<br>of all I wanted that one shop in<br>Whangarei and then I thought we'll we'll<br>have 7 shops and by the time we had 7 I<br>went public in 1979 and we had a crack<br>at Australia and then I had 70 shops and<br>then I had 150 shops and then I wanted a<br>thousand shops so it's it's all it all<br>became back to to goal setting and goal<br>setting is something that not many<br>people do I always have 30 year goals<br>and it's a funny thing but if you can<br>visualize what you'd really like to<br>stand for in 30 years time and write it<br>down on a piece of paper and put an<br>envelope and think about it and then in<br>a year's time look at it again and<br>review it you allowed to look at it once<br>a year but no more it starts you want to<br>track that very few go on and if you<br>have a very audacious goal or a very<br>ambitious goal it's better to aim really<br>high because we don't quite hit it<br>we're gonna hit really high anyhow but<br>probably that's the best thing I ever<br>did was when I the house fire went down<br>I could gulfs it instantly so starting<br>to do it is the most difficult thing how<br>you do it without a house fire burn a<br>house down maybe that's the answer but<br>know that seriously but that that makes<br>all the difference so yeah from then on<br>as I say the second chapter started and<br>it's just going on from strength of<br>string and it seems to get better I mean<br>I have so much fun I mean imagine been<br>here tonight me talking to you it's<br>ridiculous but I mean what an experience<br>for me and I hope the younger ones of<br>you here we can perhaps give something<br>that helps you a bit as a sailor two<br>volumes which are a yin and yang it's a<br>quite quite extraordinary and in that<br>goal-setting process I know that you say<br>be very specific it's not lose weight<br>its lose this much weight by X date but<br>you also are a big fan of visualization<br>and meditation could you talk a little<br>bit about visualization a few key steps<br>I think if you will in fact I should<br>probably Anki and I probably should just<br>make sure they've got them ACC right<br>because they're quite important but with<br>the gold sitting comes a few other<br>challenges because the moment you<br>started doing it and if you can write<br>something down and you become quite<br>excited about it and it does set you on<br>your way and it it frees your mind up<br>because you see the neck top computer is<br>always trying to find out what the devil<br>you're up to and it'll be any of your<br>instructions and if there's no long term<br>and it's going to take the short-term<br>ones so whatever it is and it could be<br>negatives like me I'd weld on the bloody<br>negatives so it's talking of a negatives<br>or I'll rather than the positives but if<br>a long-term one the direction will be<br>firmly set their little it'll be like a<br>a laser beam putting you towards it<br>you've got to want what you need to want<br>it though you can't just put down a<br>dream and then sort of sided maybe I'll<br>shoot can't be bothered you've really<br>got to want what you do you really do so<br>the first thing I found out was that if<br>I was going to achieve something I<br>needed it by I needed my neck top<br>computer to be properly focused and by<br>chance I found that the best way to do<br>that was I did Transcendental Meditation<br>and it's a bit like if you've got a<br>computer with a virus<br>you reboot it and you can get it back to<br>scratch again and meditation does just<br>there and by practice effortless<br>practice non-judgmental practice am i<br>dead one can occasionally come into a<br>state of pure consciousness where we<br>transcend into the true inner self which<br>is the state of infinite wisdom and when<br>we're in that state of stillness and<br>quietness after that about Wells a well<br>a font of information for you that<br>before was disguised won't be that you<br>becomes uncovered and if you have a goal<br>your goal becomes searingly clear to you<br>the other thing about meditation I don't<br>know about you but certainly with me was<br>that if I get under pressure and there's<br>a lot going on and a lot of you today<br>are doing more things like some of you<br>are probably on WeChat and Facebook and<br>I can see a few texting away right now<br>and the thing is we actually can't<br>multitask we fool ourselves we can we're<br>only giving 50% to me and 50% of the<br>WeChat or whether they were on so we're<br>think that if one wants to keep things<br>simple which i think is important that<br>we should actually have a time of our<br>peak learning experience to have the<br>ability to switch off everything<br>electronic for that period so that you<br>can think so meditation will clear it<br>can be a quick fix if you under enormous<br>pressure your mind starts whirling you<br>become frustrated<br>there's so many things you've got to do<br>at the present time that you can't<br>decide which to do you're completely<br>uptight and all you have to do is go<br>into the bathroom and sit on the toilet<br>for five minutes and do your trends and<br>dental meditation and come out and the<br>answer is quite obvious what you need to<br>do so that leads to the next rule of<br>mine was the 80/20 rule which I'm a<br>great believer in you see I've come to<br>believe that the people who achieve<br>greatness on this earth seem to work the<br>least of all of us and what they do is<br>course is focus on the 20% of the things<br>that's catered take them to their target<br>and eliminate the other 80% easier said<br>than done I know but with practice we<br>can at least kill a lot of things off<br>that we do and if you look at a week of<br>what you do what do you really need to<br>do and what could you eliminate because<br>what I what I found I needed to do was<br>to eliminate it to give myself space to<br>give myself time and if I give myself<br>time I would have time to think and if I<br>could think we could achieve greatness<br>and if you're in harmony because you've<br>got time you'll have a chance to look<br>out and like ice coming in from the<br>airport I could not believe the<br>abundance of flex and native trees that<br>have been planted on the side of the<br>road and how beautiful they look this<br>morning coming in the light you know and<br>we can see the things but we can easily<br>be chick Singh the whole way in that we<br>don't see anything and we live in it we<br>the other thing I think we need to do if<br>you want to achieve something great you<br>have to walk in a different direction<br>and anybody's ever walked in if you copy<br>you can achieve reasonable greatness but<br>it's going to be very difficult but if<br>you tread and beat a new path that<br>knitted buzz is done<br>and in fact this means trusting in<br>yourself and having the confidence in<br>yourself that you can achieve something<br>quite remarkable because each one of you<br>here and me and we're all different and<br>in that little uniqueness if we can<br>snitch what it is and take that and<br>leave that Forge that's how you can<br>achieve greatness and in doing that the<br>next thing is make mistakes you've got<br>to make mistakes if you don't make one<br>mistake a year that hurts<br>you're not moving hard enough you're<br>playing live too safe so I want you to<br>push the boundaries of what you do and<br>start making mistakes but from those<br>mistakes I want you to learn your<br>greatest lesson because until you make a<br>mistake they'll hurt and you'll learn<br>severely from them and it'll bounce you<br>to a higher level that challenge is even<br>further but gives you in figuration to<br>go further forward so relish the<br>mistakes never make them twice but<br>bounce back from that to a higher level<br>there's a couple of other things but<br>those are the main things I think I've<br>got okay well while you're digging for<br>that I might have another question since<br>you're on the subject of challenges and<br>mistakes let's get you to talk about<br>some of your whoppers and I don't know<br>what those are but I know going into<br>Canada was rough going<br>I know going into the US has been a<br>challenge even the evening entry into<br>Australia I think there were some some<br>lessons to be there and so so talk about<br>some of the mistakes you made how you<br>bounced back from them how that<br>confidence that resilience played into<br>all that thank you Kevin the main the<br>main thing was seven going into North<br>America because to see if we were going<br>to have a thousand stores and we wanted<br>to become<br>they will chain we couldn't do it a<br>nostril agent we quickly couldn't put<br>that many stores and there wasn't the<br>potential sufficient potential to do<br>that so it means we had to go somewhere<br>else so we chose Canada I mean very<br>simply and naively because there's quite<br>a few New Zealanders were some of the<br>New Zealanders and it would be a nice<br>place to be I mean how stupid is that<br>yeah so that's we did it so so we shot<br>up there and we got some spaces in<br>Vancouver and we open some shop and<br>Emmet Hill my daughter who she actually<br>opened them that's another story about<br>him because there was no favoritism she<br>actually got the position by hard work<br>and she went up there and started and we<br>did the same as we were done the house<br>so he nice fit out prime space different<br>looking shot anyone else put our stock<br>in there and open and normally we would<br>open with a sale which was a mistake<br>possibly but we opened a sale and<br>normally in a sale and you see they<br>would probably take eighty thousand<br>something like that and I ring him on<br>the afternoon I said how's it going Emma<br>fair shot this is dead I cut close I<br>can't close no one's buying no went<br>blind I said what do you take it I've<br>taken $1,200 since that there's a<br>shocking I can't believe it so it was<br>like going to a different planet no one<br>knew as Canadians of reef loyal and the<br>family's loyal if they've been with a<br>jeweler 40 years ago they're still going<br>to the same jeweler and they don't want<br>to take on someone new and the whole<br>thing was different experience a lot of<br>our stock was not skewed to their liking<br>and sorry it was so we learned some big<br>lessons there but it's taken us nearly<br>15 years to get it right but we have got<br>it right now and we have an Australian<br>man running that it used to be in the<br>Navy he's running that he's doing<br>particularly well we've got 66 shops at<br>the moment and within two years we'll<br>probably have a tea shops and we could<br>be the number one player in Canada so<br>it's so we've got it right it's really<br>good and then we thought well we'll<br>we'll try the night<br>States of America's everyone says is a<br>great place to do business so we bought<br>some of the shops from the Whitehall<br>jewelry chain that was gone at the<br>receivership two months before the<br>global financial crisis which is bloody<br>brilliant timing am i dead sir we bought<br>haven't 70 cents to the dollar we<br>thought were doing really well so anyhow<br>so we we we started there and that was a<br>totally different planet than anything I<br>had ever experienced and the whole<br>company<br>yeah there were days there where the<br>staff are quite satisfied we you take no<br>money at all didn't matter and we were<br>horrified it we'd never had a day we had<br>took nothing in Australasia ever and<br>they're these people are willing to<br>accept where there's no turnover in the<br>day like it was quite a normal practice<br>so this wasn't going to work so so we<br>had this restructure and change a lot of<br>our stock and that's when we learned<br>that we had to become a brand it was<br>very apparent and it came to us very<br>quickly that we had to be known for<br>something we could not sell the same as<br>everybody else so that's when I had to<br>start the designing my own jewelry<br>collection so there's the Michael Hill<br>bridle and Signature Collection I have<br>all these collections of diamond rings<br>based on my love of music so that if you<br>go to the Queen Street shop you can see<br>them or elbonian things like that so<br>we've we've now had to do that which we<br>didn't have before Christine's done us a<br>collection on her on a totally Rochelle<br>called a spirit Spade collection it's<br>based on that shell the GU guards will<br>and their toggle lilius they're brown<br>scuff and put up and and and you people<br>with around their knickers of a shell<br>and sometimes have on the Rings so she's<br>done a jewelry collection of those those<br>are going particularly well so we're<br>having to do a point a difference but<br>the big difference is that 55 percent of<br>sales made to jewelers in the United<br>States of America are done on credit and<br>you are the credit provider so in other<br>words we have to become credit providers<br>and they have no deposit normally it's<br>unbelievable really<br>and so they'll buy a ring usually around<br>about you know the between two and a<br>half and five thousand dollars on credit<br>and take it away and pay that over<br>eighteen months we hope and that's the<br>way we've had to start doing the<br>business because it's fifty five percent<br>of the sales but the interesting thing<br>which we had no idea about is this<br>credit is so powerful that in 18 months<br>time you ring them back again the the<br>client and say all that your engagement<br>ring that you you bought it<br>congratulations your next anniversary is<br>coming up here and you speak to him and<br>say and we've just got the matching<br>pendant and earrings that go with that<br>and the good news is you can come and<br>click that and it'll cost you no more we<br>just keep the payment going and<br>apparently you keep that payment going<br>for life but once you've got them in on<br>that gauge of thing they're there for<br>the rest of your life on anniversaries<br>presents for honor goes on it's it's<br>unbelievable so it's such a totally<br>foreign way of doing business so we're<br>trying to get our head round there we've<br>opened two shops in New York they're<br>doing quite well but we're still not<br>making anywhere near the money that we<br>would make in Australasia the rents are<br>very expensive there's so much<br>competition and whether it's the right<br>way going forwards I'm not quite sure<br>but there's another brand we've started<br>called Emma and row and we've got ten of<br>those going in in in in Queensland and<br>they're going particularly well they're<br>based on a charm type like a Pandora<br>type thing but we've got a point a<br>difference with those and we feel that<br>we're close to be able to to say that we<br>can turn those out in quite big<br>quantities and could easily have 300 of<br>those in Australasia and then we could<br>we could license those out and even have<br>a crack at places like China and Japan<br>and Singapore and so so this could be a<br>much easier model so I might get to my<br>thousand stores in a totally different<br>model than what we were thinking of<br>because it's an easier model to to run<br>you mentioned Emma your daughter who's<br>now effectively in charge of the<br>organization and I know there are some<br>times that she thought maybe she was<br>ready and the organization told her she<br>wasn't ready and she stepped out of the<br>organization and came back how do you<br>manage that personal tension between<br>father business owner mentor difficult<br>difficult was there any tension between<br>him or myself basically because we've<br>always been good friends the whole<br>family's and you know always we're<br>always very open as a as a team but<br>because Emin wanted to go into the<br>jewelry business and I had a CEO I<br>couldn't really overstep him so it was<br>up to him to say that she could go in so<br>she applied and got refused that was<br>very hard for me I must say it was very<br>difficult but it made him as stronger so<br>she winter did an MBA and then she did a<br>MBA and she got the valedictorian<br>Dressen was in that MOOC course and she<br>did pretty well then she went to work<br>for our advertising agency which is a<br>cunning thing and she came back and she<br>picked for our account because we were<br>ready to pitch and so she said with all<br>the board everything else and the Lu<br>Deegan of Sydney it did this thing there<br>he wanted a mature front the adverts<br>like a Deborah Hutton in which was not a<br>silly idea really but he'd heard that it<br>wasn't going to get through so the last<br>minute he changed his tag to not such a<br>good one so him presented this and the<br>board declined that's the evening at we<br>was told she lost the feebs account as<br>well so I could remember even on the<br>phone you bastard you bust what are you<br>doing today I'm out there was one of the<br>hardest days of my life but anyhow she<br>eventually got in and then she was<br>chosen by her peers and their course now<br>she's the chairperson so it's really<br>cool it m is a wonderful young lady I'm<br>very proud of my daughter my son's very<br>different he's very artistic he's like<br>Christie my wife he's a sculptor makes<br>big works in court and steel but between<br>the two of them right there there<br>the business for the future because<br>Emma's not artistic and mark is very<br>artistic at an all great brands if we<br>become a grandpa brand eventually you<br>know we've got the artistic side with<br>marketers wife Monica and this mo with<br>her you know business brain which is a<br>makes a great package going forward and<br>without that I don't know whether I<br>would carry on I think I would probably<br>sell out and do something else with it<br>but it gives you the encouragement to to<br>carry on and and make this become<br>something pretty significant the other<br>thing we do which is quite interesting<br>and what you might find interesting that<br>four times a year we have a family<br>meeting we've now been doing this for<br>nine years so we have our lawyer and we<br>have our accountants and there's a<br>proper agenda and so mark goes and and<br>Monica is wife goes and and Emma goes<br>and there's obviously us and we talk<br>about anything we like but we all talk<br>about the main thing of course is the<br>jewelry business which is our main<br>interest the pin as the golf course and<br>there's the violin come and all the<br>other things and then there's their<br>interests as well and making sure that<br>we all understand and all working<br>together to achieve the same goals<br>because it's amazing the different<br>values of even mark and the Emma you<br>know I mean they're they're quite<br>differently driven and and getting<br>everything in coordination and I think<br>one of the big mistakes a lot of people<br>make particularly have accumulated a bit<br>of money is that they don't do that and<br>then when they've gone everything sort<br>of just falls apart really and it<br>becomes disenchantment and and and and<br>even enemies and we are a very closest<br>family our best friends they're our<br>family<br>and I think by the open communication<br>we've all become much closer and we all<br>work together I mean we've all got<br>problems I mean sometimes you say you're<br>getting far too smart you think maybe I<br>am so I better be careful of that so you<br>know you everyone's it is this you know<br>we can all say what we like to everybody<br>and there woody will take it as an<br>offence it should that's the way it<br>should be really and so we're all<br>driving for a for a better group of<br>people really and<br>and having a little fun yeah thanks for<br>that I've got two questions but only<br>time for one before I turn it over to<br>the audience so you talked about Emma<br>getting the MBA and for my MBAs in the<br>audience I hear that but you also have a<br>particular point of view about the use<br>of education and the need to be close to<br>the cold face and combining that so<br>that's one possible question or in a<br>completely different direction<br>I think subject to shareholder approval<br>you're looking at listing it on the<br>Australian Stock Exchange where as<br>you're already on the New Zealand Stock<br>Exchange so you can either talk about<br>the education process or talk about what<br>it's like the list on a different<br>exchange and at the at the face of it<br>might seem like but once you've done one<br>exchange they're all easy but maybe not<br>so well we'll ask the exchange one first<br>it seemed um our business somewhere<br>regretfully but our head office is now<br>in Brisbane and Australia we have a very<br>big manufacturing plant there we don't<br>do all their manufacturing because a lot<br>of intricate works now then in India<br>which is unbelievable all under<br>microscopes putting cos the size of<br>pinheads and making a beautiful job and<br>China's not far behind there as well<br>those two countries away but we do quite<br>a lot of setting and so we have quite a<br>big manufacturing division in fact the<br>biggest in Australasia so everything is<br>set up there we report an Australian<br>dollars and the other thing is our P is<br>far too low and I don't know it's<br>something if we we listed on a bigger<br>exchange I'm sure we will have a much<br>better P than we are because we're<br>highly underrated as a stock upon iron<br>I'm writing down my sector and and I<br>mean I we shouldn't be where we are so<br>and there's it's too difficult for an<br>Australian to invest in us because I<br>mean they've got so much paperwork and B<br>burocracy - it's a deal in new zealand<br>they've got about a 40-page think to<br>shout whether they've even wanted list<br>of the music ponies in stock so it'll<br>simple part of the whole process so<br>we're trying to get shareholders<br>approval and if we do we differently<br>will be floating there and it could be<br>as soon as<br>the snakes financial ear I think it will<br>be a good thing for us I really do<br>and the other question was the education<br>piece the coalface are you combining a<br>formal education with oh yes oh yes yes<br>yeah yeah well you can do a degree and<br>you can learn the theory of something<br>and that I poured you for doing that<br>I've never done it it must be amazing to<br>do that but you need to also have the<br>practical experience so it takes 10,000<br>hours to learn how to sell properly and<br>to run a jewelry business but if you do<br>that with what you've got then I think<br>in this room there could be some bright<br>young leaders that would perhaps could<br>join me in my challenges and we could<br>train you up but you still got to do the<br>10,000 hours to become one of the<br>hotshots in our business you see our top<br>people in more than you would be as a<br>lawyer in a partnership more than any<br>architect you could earn great money you<br>can own huge money but it's not the it's<br>still the money it's the Challenger you<br>would be seeing the world running up<br>running a place somewhere else like<br>running a country doing amazing things<br>and I just I just put it out there<br>because I dearly love one of you to join<br>me because it's a young people's world<br>and you're the ones we should be and I<br>shouldn't have to find someone that's to<br>Audrey and make them famous I'd like to<br>make you people super famous and I see<br>some great faces of here it's<br>interesting that in New Zealand this<br>sells people now are now gold club we<br>have we have different Platinum Club<br>Platinum Club Gold Club and silver Club<br>Platinum Club is a million plus and<br>we've got one ladies done two two and a<br>half million this year in sales and<br>she's Chinese we have a Russian lady<br>Indian lady<br>mainly all Chinese Chinese Chinese of<br>our best salespeople now and a lot of<br>managers Asians are good managers coming<br>through our agents I don't know why I<br>think it's because it's it's if they've<br>had it so hard they they have to prove<br>something and that's why if that's the<br>thing I say about you New Zealand you<br>just need to be careful at these people<br>that's you know because you're just as<br>good but you you let them heaven but<br>anyhow I love Asians as well and our<br>best I'd say most of our jewelry sales<br>are coming from Asians now - so we're<br>we're selling it's red hot Asians love<br>jewelry and they love us oh my god we're<br>doing a lot of business with them it's<br>quite incredible really I've lost the<br>plot of the question but there you go<br>your honor that's a perfect time to turn<br>the plot over to the audience I want to<br>turn it over to the audience for any<br>questions I've got a young lady here in<br>the future right there asking you a<br>yeah yeah he son didn't hear the last<br>bit oh yes biggest mistake I ever made<br>that's a very good point other than<br>tonight no no well the biggest mistake I<br>think was you see I was so naive when I<br>got a board I didn't know what a board<br>was I didn't know what people did on a<br>board was a purpose and I didn't have<br>the right mix of people on the board and<br>they turned against me but they went<br>through me nice and anyhow they set you<br>up you you you should go into shoes and<br>they put me at the bloody shoes and it<br>didn't work and so we had seven shoe<br>shops and very quickly and I was doing<br>adverts on Telugu Michael Hill jeweller<br>gold gold silver silver chain chain sell<br>sell gold gold silver chain just like a<br>little julep and then hello<br>Michael Hill shoes I've got these silly<br>row shoes here a duck welcome to<br>Palmerston North all of it and I don't<br>know where the hell I was coming and<br>going any other after seven shops we<br>closed all the shoe shops and<br>concentrated on on the core thing which<br>so we became too complicated and too<br>complex complexity is your enemy be<br>aware of it beware of it any fool can<br>complicate anything keeping things<br>simple is the answer<br>thanks for that on the back row here<br>you'll have to speak up my hearings not<br>well we have we have bonus systems for<br>everybody so on the sales floor<br>once you've in five times you're earning<br>your into a good percentage of what you<br>take so when the gold starring me doing<br>very well once the time they made<br>Platinum Club they're earning very big<br>money so platinum seller will probably<br>be making about one hundred and twenty<br>thousand dollars per annum the top girl<br>we've got the big there was a prize for<br>any we could do over two million so she<br>got actually a quarter of a million just<br>for doing it so we pay very well<br>managers get a percentage of the whole<br>profit of the shop of their shop and<br>managers canoe and more than a good shop<br>manager Kinnear more than a district or<br>area manager I which they sometimes do<br>we have a a very good girl in Albany<br>who's doing extremely well and was once<br>at Luke's and another one in in Medicare<br>those are very good shops for us were<br>they they earn seriously big money and<br>then once you get up to a manager of a<br>country and then you get bonus the<br>course on the whole executive teams<br>better but your your area also gets gets<br>a special bonus and then of course the<br>head guy gets the bigger bonus of all of<br>course they were like he's working for<br>your New Zealand whatever it is it's the<br>same sort of thing really but there's<br>the challenges I mean they they have to<br>perform and if they don't perform you<br>know they really looked at so and we're<br>always trying to push ourselves and make<br>sure that we have the best people it's<br>very easy to get people in the company<br>and the company to become comfortable<br>you know and it's easy to accept people<br>that are holding you back but really<br>they're doing an enormous disadvantage<br>it's like the read daughters<br>it's very something if you didn't have<br>the system like this you could be<br>repeating read read read replayed he<br>just they're they're like drones and<br>they sort of hide in a system but they<br>actually pull the whole thing down so<br>unless we can train them up they really<br>need they're in the wrong career they<br>need moving on to<br>and get someone that's Kim again because<br>if you have all gold or gold stars in a<br>shop that shops just getting her crazy<br>yeah well I guess the motivation was<br>that um I had nothing I had to have<br>something and I just had to succeed<br>there was no ifs or buts I was going to<br>I just had to do it so I had to find a<br>backer and I found the backer people to<br>put them honey up the only wanted 20%<br>which was amazing so what's an amazing<br>deal and in five years time I paid him<br>back and and then we went flooded so<br>that the main overriding goal was I just<br>wanted to be I just wanted to do<br>something that was sleeved to mark on<br>something I just I had to do it and here<br>so was a big goal but once we did it<br>it's a funny thing you know I never had<br>any fear from that moment on I mean<br>people said you wait till you don't have<br>a day where you take any money or you<br>got the worries of us never had a fear<br>from it at all yeah we actually we are<br>control of fear in here fear is only<br>what we make all their own decisions<br>really whether we're fearful or we're<br>confident or it's it's purely a nick top<br>computer that system really yeah and<br>it's just a matter of flicking a switch<br>I mean I find it amazing in them and I'm<br>pretty strict with a lot of heat but<br>people said well I can't give up you<br>know a teaspoon of sugar in my coffee or<br>I can't give up dessert so I can't do<br>that but it's just just flick the switch<br>and so I'm going to do it as simple as<br>that or can't give up see you can give<br>up these things that flesh if you really<br>want to and I think really one does need<br>to be if one's going to be really<br>successful you've got to be<br>you've got to start putting a stake in<br>the ground and doing some things that<br>are uncomfortable and just do it because<br>if you don't you know you're you're<br>gonna wimp along really thank you very<br>much yeah I think studying at your<br>father's hand you had all the skills<br>right yeah your dad was an expert<br>salesman it was just the catalyst right<br>and I'm not suggesting everyone go home<br>and burn their house down but whatever<br>your own personal catalyst might be<br>right but the silly part about it if it<br>hadn't been the house fire would I been<br>I mean I had a nice lifestyle that<br>lovely wife had two lovely children we<br>had a little boat we could draw out and<br>you know catch a flounder and catch a<br>snapper for dinner and I made my home<br>brew and I had sake as a brewing in the<br>bathroom I mean it was lovely we had a<br>great lifestyle and parties I think<br>would I have carried on doing that what<br>I've eventually brought out my uncle and<br>perhaps a couple of shots of Manggarai<br>oh no and the little boat it would ever<br>been it could have been could have been<br>or what a difference I mean the<br>difference between vets and what I'm<br>doing is just indescribable really and I<br>mean I wouldn't be here for a start I<br>mean how good is this I got a hand over<br>here yes here on the end thank you well<br>it's a quite a complicated question<br>question but and out in our position the<br>only thing that's going to make us<br>successful from now on if we want to<br>become something you know greater than<br>what we are and in fact they our next<br>goal is to take the company from half a<br>billion to one billion in about five<br>years so the only thing that's gonna<br>make a difference is that we can we've<br>got to walk a different path so we've<br>got to go more collections more original<br>product so in other words I like<br>two-thirds of our product needs to be<br>we got our own watches you sell about<br>65,000 watches a year but and we've got<br>our own starting but they're in jewelry<br>Christine's collection but we need to<br>grow on those so what we need to put<br>ourselves apart from the Pascoe's or<br>whatever it is you are selling exactly<br>the same product as everybody else<br>that's on a slippery slope downwards<br>because there's no end to people again<br>to find a cheaper price to this saw<br>there because it's exactly the same<br>product so if we have different and<br>creative product that's different then<br>we have the opportunity of standing<br>apart so until we become a brand and<br>when we do become a brand then we secure<br>ourselves as a permanent platform and<br>that's the secret to our success the<br>other thing is that a lot of people are<br>shopping on the internet now so there's<br>lots of you know it's changed<br>dramatically and people now will look at<br>this site before they come in the shop<br>we don't sell that much either it's<br>going to be have four shops worth of on<br>the Internet<br>but a lot of people look at it all the<br>world and they make their mind up<br>whether they want to come and see or not<br>so it's it's completely changing<br>platform but when they do come in the<br>experience has got to be an amazing<br>experience so that's the other thing so<br>if we have a lovely product at the right<br>price very competitive but nobody else<br>has got it can't get anywhere else<br>and then they have an experience which<br>is overwhelmingly marvellous not how's<br>your day been and ant-like they believe<br>it yeah you know then then it all<br>becomes easier said than done but that's<br>that's the principles for success for us<br>yeah thanks on the back row there<br>look project a bit more that'd be good<br>thank you<br>pursuing growing there in the jewelry<br>business is different from most other<br>product though that it's a product<br>fortunately we're very lucky that is<br>something we sell the most emotional and<br>probably sacred product that you can buy<br>really which is you know the key Center<br>life as the unit is your wedding band<br>and your your engagement ring which is<br>such emotional purchase any of the guy<br>who goes and buys it on Blue Nile or<br>buys it from the bloody warehouse I mean<br>it gotta be it's not a good start as it<br>really so so yeah so fortunately they<br>want to come into the store and if they<br>have a lovely experience so we're very<br>fortunate the the lower price product<br>like you know the chains and the<br>earrings and that sort of that's what's<br>selling mainly so we're not selling too<br>many of them but they get the idea of<br>what they see for the bigger product and<br>then will come in they'll have their<br>choice of shops to come in but it is<br>certainly becoming more and more while<br>there's no doubt about it<br>and we're very conscious of it and<br>trying to get our site a lot better it<br>well that's very funny isn't really<br>because I don't like golf it's going to<br>kill I built two difficulty golf course<br>but uh but it's a funny thing but you<br>see my parents used to play golf and<br>when I was at their State House of men's<br>street there I I had formed an 18-hole<br>golf course and put baked beans cans and<br>upside down and formed the red star golf<br>course and and charged one on sixpence<br>for the Whangarei voice I score boys to<br>be a member of this course and it's<br>funny that that idea sort of stuck with<br>me so when we built our house in<br>Queenstown I put a green out the front<br>and I got John Darby to design ID at the<br>golf course designer to design that for<br>me and I built that with green keeper<br>from Millbrook and we had a lot of fun<br>and then I thought well I'll put another<br>couple of greens in and I can make a<br>chip and putt and so we did that and we<br>it was quite nice and we had tournaments<br>with Millbrook where they'd play at<br>Millbrook and we call my place Hill<br>broken they'd come and have a shootout<br>on the hill brook you see him and we did<br>that Farrelly New Zealand's has sent<br>children overseas on adventure trips and<br>so we did that for a few years and then<br>my cost came from was rang me one day<br>from the radio and he he said I believe<br>you've got a chip and putt and don't<br>come looking forward to come and playing<br>next year I thought that sounds a bit<br>wanky so I rang up Derby and I said<br>could you put up a proper serious path<br>for Holland which is our dragonfly Lake<br>hole number six so we did that and we<br>were down there and I thought well I<br>said to Dobby we're down there it's a<br>bit ridiculous having a dear farmer just<br>know you might at least go back to the<br>house so he did that and there's a lot<br>of fun it was also a lot of heartache<br>but we did it and he said why don't you<br>build a full course I didn't really<br>thought about that I thought I could do<br>he said look I'll build you one for four<br>million no bunkers very simple million<br>for the irrigation I reckon I can do it<br>I shook hands done didn't tell Christine<br>as you do<br>eighteen million dollars later we built<br>it yeah but it was the best thing I ever<br>did they<br>it's amazing the land is unbelievable<br>and yeah it's such a special piece of<br>land and then of course I was up north<br>and I saw Ellen gives a sculptural park<br>and I thought goodness me this is<br>amazing<br>why can't I put sculptures on my Golf<br>Course and no one does sculptures and<br>golf together so we started putting some<br>amazing art and I've got these hundred<br>and ten wolves by Louvre Wang of Beijing<br>from 7-9 eight of the Art District and<br>I've got a few other big guys I've got a<br>big seated man when I'm looking at and<br>getting from Winchester in the UK going<br>to look up next month a huge seated<br>figure that looks realistic it's quite<br>amazing there's all these things we can<br>do and I'm going to build a par 3 course<br>but the silly part about it is that Emma<br>was running is running the clubhouse too<br>as well and three years ago she said<br>there do you realize you're losing<br>twenty-two thousand dollars a week I was<br>golf course so anyhow she's now got<br>she's out we're actually now making a<br>profit and it's a closed membership<br>we've got two hundred family memberships<br>and that's it we've got a waiting list<br>but seven on the waiting list and we're<br>going to eventually make it like on<br>August where we completely closed down<br>at least you're a member<br>that'll be it and it'll it's it's a very<br>special piece of land and we have people<br>of the members don't even play golf it's<br>funny I said the clubhouse this morning<br>to get that book there and there was<br>someone there at eight o'clock it<br>doesn't play golf I go there every day<br>just for breakfast and for lunch and<br>it's quite funny really but we're very<br>lucky to have that piece of land and<br>we've had the open for seven years which<br>is the longest anyone's in the history<br>of 100 years of the open so it's good<br>and it's nice to support New Zealand<br>golf which has had a hard time endure<br>but I've underwritten it for that time<br>and its cost me a lot of money so thank<br>goodness next year must issue from your<br>books and the writing is so I'll be<br>quite happy about there<br>yeah good I'm getting queued with<br>several more questions but I do want to<br>be respectful of your time as and again<br>thank you all for being here and thank</p></main><footer
