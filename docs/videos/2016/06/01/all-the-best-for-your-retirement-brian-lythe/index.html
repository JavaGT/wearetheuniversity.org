All the best for your retirement!</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Li Brian's departure needs a poem of<br>length one which matches his substance<br>his talents his strength it's so<br>important that we appointed the first<br>advisor dedicated fulltime to<br>International students at the University<br>of Auckland in<br>1972 we're just recently wishing<br>farewell to Brian Li who's retiring<br>after 44 4 years of service his<br>dedication is a model for all of us I<br>miss the student life because students<br>are so positive I mean I love students<br>because they don't muck around when they<br>come in to see you about something they<br>don't hang around about it they tell you<br>exactly what it is so you know straight<br>away what you're dealing with and then<br>we get on to it because I strongly<br>advocate for students and I'll miss all<br>of the involvement with students but<br>I'll replace it with 115,000 voters out<br>in the west of O and 100,000 bees in<br>fruit trees he'll support and assist you<br>and never will fail to be honest<br>outspoken principled Fair he embodies<br>the practice of pastoral care I can't<br>think of anybody in New Zealand who has<br>made a contribution of that duration or<br>that scale to the pastoral care of those<br>students and therefore to their<br>probability of success I frequently<br>travel to the developing countries where<br>the New Zealand aid program is offered<br>and one of the great Pleasures is to<br>meet our graduate and the first thing<br>people ask me is how's Uncle Brian and<br>the second thing they tell me are the<br>stories of how Brian made such a<br>difference to their experience he'll<br>find you a flat a fridge and a bed he's<br>generous thoughtful he's funny he's red<br>Brian has been one person person who has<br>been pivotal in my journey here in New<br>Zealand we call him like a Santa Claus<br>because he is really generous well for<br>me Brian is the best and the reason I<br>say that because he's the most helpful<br>and approachable um person that I have<br>ever met I would say Brian is a yes<br>person because he provided<br>me at any time anything he is always<br>ready to help student he never say I'm<br>busy come back later he's always ready<br>and he always have solution awesome is<br>uh perhaps an understatement and uh I<br>want to describe Brian and all those<br>fantastic efforts he he made for us all<br>in the first day I met him he served me<br>a coffee Outlander style of coffee and<br>then it's not about the taste but about<br>smile and fatherhood so I feel like it's<br>very how do you call it very touching<br>and he just grabbed me by the arm and<br>said we have to get your bank set up and<br>we have to get your books and how's um<br>the place you're living are you all set<br>up and just him being so nice and so<br>helpful and so worried that everything<br>was set up okay he gave me some tips on<br>schooling that I don't have to be<br>worried that it's a D1 or D 10 school<br>it's all the same in New Zealand every<br>every school is good so it's just very<br>reassuring and make things easy anytime<br>I needed help and I would just email him<br>and then he he said come to my office<br>and talk to me about anything and then<br>all everything was fine he gave me a<br>sense of welcoming before I came to New<br>Zealand he emails to me and he<br>introduced New Zealand cultures and and<br>I was I I felt so welcoming before I<br>came so I felt it's the best part of<br>meid Brian it was more of a fatherly<br>figure always there when things were<br>down looking gloomy sometimes I'm<br>thinking of picking up coming back to<br>Port Mosby said that's fine don't worry<br>s starting from trivial think like oh I<br>need roommate to big problem like oh I<br>think I cannot make it this exam he<br>always have the solution if even for him<br>I would be back home already then and<br>wouldn't finish my masters everything<br>from making sure that I was all right to<br>making sure that I had my studies and my<br>um uh teachers all in order he was there<br>so the support he gave to me and the<br>support that this University gave to me<br>was tremendous and I I can't imagine him<br>leaving I remember he talk about his<br>farming he talk about his grandchildren<br>and I love that so much because it's I<br>feel it's quite personal that he share<br>all his uh story with me so um yeah he<br>he's like uh he's like my grandfather<br>actually so um I love him so much I mean<br>like when I have difficulty in academic<br>he helped me too and then you know I've<br>never crying in front of the people but<br>last time I cried in front of the Brian<br>you know I mean like it's like father is<br>like I don't know I can open with him<br>anything I can talk to him it's me that<br>gets the greatest sort of nourishment<br>and fulfillment from knowing them<br>because the student questions are pretty<br>much the same a place to live sorting<br>out my study money to pay for things<br>friends to enjoy for me I want to know<br>what's going on in teore or what's going<br>on in Afghanistan or what's going on in<br>Peru or what's going on in Brazil like<br>just now there's a big issues in Brazil<br>so student came in yesterday I said give<br>me a tutorial on what's happening there<br>so I always say and I mean it that I'm<br>the person who benefits most because the<br>television can show you bombs being<br>thrown and things being exploded but it<br>doesn't tell you always or very often<br>the story behind that students will give<br>you the story behind them so my life is<br>enriched because of what they can tell<br>me Brian thanks a lot for being there<br>for me both when I was an international<br>student and now being employed in<br>international office being part of your<br>family Brian worked with you for 10<br>years it's been a wonderful experience<br>loved working with you all the time<br>loved your neck for working around the<br>system which has sometimes caused me a<br>few Shivers but has been fantastic we'll<br>really really miss you and wish you all<br>the best lots of love Brian one of the<br>things that I love about you is that<br>nothing is ever too much trouble for you<br>we're going to miss you so I wanted to<br>thank you for that contribution it is<br>really quite extraordinary to spend<br>almost the whole of your working life<br>making that contribution we are very<br>grateful for everything that you have<br>done for the University thank you um<br>Brian thank you so much um for being<br>there for me as a student as a staff and<br>give me the encouragement that I need<br>I'm privileged to<br>to know you<br>um and I'm thankful for the long years<br>that I worked with you I think one of<br>the greatest things I've learned from<br>you is
