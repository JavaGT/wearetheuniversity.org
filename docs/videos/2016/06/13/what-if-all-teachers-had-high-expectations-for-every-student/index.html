The project involved 2500 primary school students and 90 teachers and found that high expectation teaching raised the achievement in maths by nearly 30% - the equivalent of a whole term’s additional learning – irrespective of class level, decile, ethnicity or gender.  Christine suggests that increasing equity in our schools lies in creating and developing more high expectation teachers who can continue to have an impact on children long after the initial investment in their training has ended.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>little 5-year-olds bounce in the<br>classroom door and within two to 3 weeks<br>maximum they're in an ability group<br>where they're labeled and for the rest<br>of their school life pretty much they<br>remain in those ability groups it sets<br>them up for either achievement or<br>failure right through scoring the<br>teacher expectation project was based<br>around my research on high expectation<br>teachers where I identified particular<br>practices and beliefs of high<br>expectation teachers that differed from<br>those of other teachers High expectation<br>teachers are those who have high<br>expectations for everybody in their<br>class and they did things like not<br>ability grouping for example they used<br>flexible kinds of grouping they created<br>a very warm classroom climate so that it<br>became like a little Community where<br>everyone worked together and they set<br>very clear learning goals with their<br>students so the children knew exactly<br>where they were and where they were<br>going next but they didn't make ability<br>Salient in the classroom day after day<br>interestingly New Zealand has the<br>highest grouping rate of any oecd<br>country and we also have the highest<br>disparity between our highest and our<br>lowest Achievers I don't think that's<br>coincidence I applied for a mden fart<br>Grant and I was very fortunate to<br>actually win it that was an experimental<br>study where we randomly assigned<br>teachers to either the intervention<br>group group or the control group and<br>then the intervention group were trained<br>in the practices of high expectation<br>teachers and they also learned about<br>verbal versus nonverbal Behavior why why<br>you homor did your homework why didn't<br>you got your<br>tongs this one he's really happy he's<br>probably praising<br>morning like come on come on you know<br>angry telling off somebody telling off<br>somebody really angry if a teacher<br>expects you to do well she pushes you<br>and gives you work that's higher than<br>your like age she doesn't do anything<br>negative nothing like that there<br>everything positive to make you feel<br>better it definitely makes me feel more<br>confident she would let me do my best<br>and she will show me my gaps and<br>so I can work on it being part of the<br>teacher expectation project was actually<br>a real blessing like lots of things just<br>stuck with me for example the fact that<br>about 30% of students are actually in<br>the wrong group they are not being<br>assessed correctly or forever whatever<br>reason ability grouping is entrenched in<br>New Zealand particularly in reading and<br>interestingly we got the largest effects<br>in<br>maths um the students in the<br>intervention group gained 28% above what<br>the control group um gained over one<br>just one year that's more than a whole<br>term's learning in one year and it was<br>mostly I think because teachers were<br>more able to move away from ability<br>grouping in maths because it's not quite<br>as entrenched whereas in Reading they<br>really struggle teachers in New Zealand<br>just don't know how to teach reading<br>without students being an ability groups<br>I've been developing a proposal for a<br>project that I'm calling the height<br>project which is high teacher<br>expectation we thought that we would<br>train the mentor teachers rather than<br>the teachers themselves because those<br>are the the management people who can<br>then work with their teachers to embed<br>the practices of high expectation<br>teachers when we had Senior Management<br>people involved their students did even<br>better than in schools where management<br>didn't really take an interest the more<br>that teachers engaged in the practices<br>of high expectation teachers the greater</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
