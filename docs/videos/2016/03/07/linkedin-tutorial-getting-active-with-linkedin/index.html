here we're going to take a<br>detailed look at how you can stay active<br>with your network in though our session<br>we talked about building your profile<br>it's your brand it's your story but<br>LinkedIn is more than just a brochure<br>site it's filled with informative<br>content it's made up of millions of<br>members and companies so there's a huge<br>opportunity for you to learn stay<br>informed and to be a valuable member of<br>your network let's take a look at some<br>of this content some of the information<br>you see is going to be pushed to you by<br>linkedin based on your profile and your<br>behavior on the site for example and the<br>Activity Feed we might see suggestions<br>to view companies or jobs we'll see<br>advertisements connection suggestions<br>and groups to explore you'll also have<br>an opportunity to search for information<br>so let's take a look at how this works<br>at the top of the page you'll see the<br>search field you can search for anything<br>you like in here trading a name or a<br>company or a topic into the quick search<br>and link denville preview and then<br>return results from the site a word like<br>Auckland returns all sorts of related<br>results alternatively we can tune the<br>search to look for specific content if<br>you want to find a group in New Zealand<br>for entrepreneurs for example you might<br>search New Zealand entrepreneur and then<br>you go ask the join the group contribute<br>and your networks just become richer so<br>I've got ten suggestions for you for<br>staying active if you do these regularly<br>you're going to be noticed then you're<br>going to be making the most of your<br>network of information first up engage<br>with the content in your activity feed<br>so keep a regular eye on what's being<br>shared by your network like it comment<br>and share where you think it's<br>appropriate remember to keep the balance<br>by not overdoing it think quality not<br>quantity try researching and following<br>companies that inspire you maybe it's<br>because you want to work for them you<br>love the products or you associate with<br>the brand that not only is it valuable<br>to keep up to date with their news but<br>your activity feed will include content<br>that you might want to share at to your<br>network<br>same goes with University pages and<br>follow them learn and share from the<br>education institutions that inspire you<br>this one might seem obvious but you<br>should regularly search for and connect<br>with people from your network so you can<br>discover colleagues and clients and<br>classmates through the search link tins<br>also going to make suggestions and<br>people will be viewing your profile so<br>reach out with the connection request I<br>always think it's a good idea to provide<br>some context maybe a reminder of how you<br>know each other or why you want to meet<br>them one way to stay in contact with<br>your connections is to think about<br>sharing content tagging them into<br>postseason they might find interesting<br>use the @ symbol and you'll be able to<br>find people from within your network and<br>add this piece of content into the air<br>activity feed you can also send direct<br>messages to people using the in mail<br>feature so this is handy if you want to<br>reach out more privately though you can<br>use in males to introduce to context<br>together you can also include<br>attachments into these as well use the<br>group's to get involved with<br>conversations these are a great source<br>of information there's a huge number of<br>groups though so to choose wisely and<br>keep track of them remember find the<br>groups through your search make a<br>request to join and get involved at<br>groups do generate lots of notification<br>emails but you can keep these to a<br>minimum if you have your settings<br>correctly set think about recommending<br>people in your network if you said they<br>deserve it you can do this by visiting a<br>profile clicking on the little drop-down<br>and choosing recommend so I recommend<br>keeping this professional keep it<br>concise and you may even get a<br>recommendation and return which can add<br>to your credibility in your network for<br>more great sources of news and<br>information try accessing Linton's pulse<br>feature so from your homepage click on<br>pulse under interests you'll discover a<br>huge range of influences thought leaders<br>topic channels in content providers<br>think of these as blah<br>sori magazines that add relevant<br>articles into your activity feed you can<br>like comment and share these out to your<br>network and the more you think about<br>your network in terms of giving rather<br>than getting the more more value you'll<br>get from it which takes us to number 10<br>and probably the most important part of<br>being active on Linkedin that is posting<br>content this content could be your own<br>thoughts something shared from on<br>linkedin or sourced from another site so<br>you can add a short update using the<br>share and update link or a longer blog<br>type post from here choose publish a<br>post and access this rich layout feature<br>again my advice is quality not quantity<br>here try to stay on your brand and keep<br>an eye on the posts that get the most<br>attention from your network do more of<br>those so with these ten ways to stay<br>active I'm sure you'll stay busy but<br>think of this time as an investment in<br>your brand in your career they're done<br>right it will not be time wasted I try<br>to allocate 10 or 15 minutes at the<br>start of every day to link them activity<br>so it never ques up and I never let it<br>take over my day I hope this has been<br>useful thanks for supporting the<br>business school I hope you can do in the<br>next session where we're going to take a<br>look at some of the great tools that<br>have been specifically designed for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
