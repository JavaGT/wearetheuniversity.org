automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in terms of what we're going to look at<br>is basically how we actually use social<br>media we will give you some statistics<br>then we'll also talk about personal<br>brand and do you all know that you've<br>got a personal brand yeah so it's a<br>relatively recent thing it takes some<br>people by surprise but obviously with<br>social media it has such an impact on<br>social branding so Facebook one point 49<br>billion YouTube a billion users four<br>billion views per your day so and what<br>do you guys got for disadvantages first<br>week of it off what do you guys think<br>sorry for you distractions what does it<br>wondering that cyber bullying<br>cyberbullying yep multitasking not<br>really title aids yeah I hear you yep<br>yeah okay what about benefits them one<br>of the benefits of social media that a<br>little bear things were the great things<br>is she right here's worth it yeah and<br>you can keep up with what's happening<br>right you really turn a justice you're<br>freaking UK you totally so we had a few<br>most of those so can reduce privacy none<br>of you said about the time I don't think<br>it can take up a lot of time the whole<br>personal and professional thing can<br>become really intertwined yeah it can<br>encourage informality which my personal<br>branding point of view can be a little<br>bit tricky and information you put some<br>information on the Internet can be so<br>taken out of context and can be really<br>damaging so it's things like that we've<br>got to think about there is that whole<br>emotional connection and it can decrease<br>that and also communication skills then<br>of course you've got the whole bullying<br>then of course facebook is selling your<br>personal information so then they can<br>target those ads to you in fact yeah<br>it's not just Facebook a whole lot of<br>people are selling companies are selling<br>your personal information forward<br>identity theft all of that comes into it<br>but it does allow you to access a<br>community and if you do have people that<br>you want to keep in contact with<br>particularly people outs sort of outside<br>of Auckland it makes it so much easier<br>so that is an advantage that's the whole<br>social thing worldwide connectivity<br>people with common interests so we do<br>like to be with people who are like us<br>so it helps us find our tribe if you<br>like so that is a really good thing<br>about it and then the whole personal<br>brand and searching for a job so you can<br>be hit hunted justice linkedin is an<br>example so you can actually find context<br>on the air for informational interviews<br>so what was that it was 380 million<br>roughly on linkedin but just university<br>of auckland alone there's 80,000 165<br>plus so that's current students alumni<br>and staff so that's a huge network and<br>you can go on to linkedin and you can<br>actually see where they work what they<br>do and you can drill down further so if<br>you want to know about a job for example<br>so you're thinking about<br>changing changing roles and you're not<br>quite sure what people do in that role<br>you can go on to LinkedIn you can<br>identify someone from the University of<br>Auckland who may be studied something<br>similar to you you can find out what<br>they're doing you can make a connection<br>with them and ask if you can do an<br>informational interview so you can go<br>and talk to them about their job because<br>when you are trying to connect with<br>people it is good to find sums something<br>can common so I know someone she was a<br>law graduate so she went through all the<br>law firms through the partners trying to<br>find just one thing at least in common<br>so an example she gave me was she found<br>someone who spoke French and she had<br>just been in France so when she<br>contacted him she used data to hook to<br>get in and coincidentally that was the<br>firm she got the job with this person<br>has brainstormed all the different<br>things that they are involved in<br>interested in so they've got linkedin<br>they've got a fan page on Facebook<br>they've got Twitter they've got a blog<br>YouTube iTunes but they've got all that<br>stuff so how do they keep track of it in<br>hell news to they actually find the time<br>so ways that you can actually save time<br>as de setting up a schedule so actually<br>making a date with yourself to really do<br>it some people talk about just doing it<br>for half an hour ago stockpiling content<br>so you see interesting things come<br>through so actually just keep them in<br>the folder and then you can sort of like<br>send it through you can read your posts<br>to be seen to automatically then also if<br>you have a particular audience in mind<br>that say might be in the United States<br>you can actually Google what the best<br>time is to tweet or Facebook or whatever<br>it is and you can figure it figure out<br>like if it is overseas what the best<br>time might be it's quite often when<br>people are going homes they're like if<br>they use public transport they'll be on<br>their phones and doing it that way<br>dinner time is not a great great time<br>but you can research that information<br>even you came to get up a Google Alert<br>for unspecified topics how many of you<br>who do have a Google Alert yeah<br>so you just go on to google if you<br>google google it'll come up and it'll<br>actually if you've got a google account<br>it all sort of pop up straight away with<br>your gmail in your name but you can add<br>in different other alerts as well so<br>keywords for example and you can choose<br>to get those alerts they let you either<br>have it daily or weekly but no not<br>monthly or anything but you can get at a<br>digest form so you just get one email so<br>like once a week I'm so if anything<br>comes up about your name accompany your<br>colleagues who you work for whatever it<br>is you can actually get those alerts so<br>HootSuite is basically you can just use<br>that one platform and have all of your<br>social media accounts or most of them on<br>that one platform which is this is what<br>it looks like so it kind of is a little<br>bit crazy when you're first starting off<br>with it and my holiday project is to get<br>more to grips with HootSuite but this<br>person has lets their Facebook page<br>showing but the account showing they've<br>also got flicker they've got Google+<br>Twitter to wordpress blogs youtube and a<br>whole lot of other things as well so you<br>can post from this and you can also<br>schedule posts time them for when you<br>want them to send out so you can doesn't<br>just go to the one thing rather than<br>going on to all those individual<br>accounts so that's another way of saving<br>time so I think that steps what was it<br>ten million so it's not a lot that are<br>using it but for people with multiple<br>accounts once you've got to growth it<br>can be quite handy and if you're into<br>select States then you've actually have<br>really good analytics as well so you can<br>actually analyze and do spreadsheets and<br>if you're a nerd have fun like me so um<br>before we sort of go on to these and<br>sort of platforms people don't often<br>think like what is the purpose of thing<br>Oh everyone's like for me I know I go<br>onto facebook was everyone else did I<br>don't really have a purpose or goal in<br>mind but it sort of good you know<br>because there's so many out there to<br>think about you know what is your<br>objective what is your purpose but going<br>on to these platforms and<br>how often and reality are you going to<br>use it so considering upfront before you<br>join these things wildly and end up with<br>about 10 of these platforms that you're<br>never going to use what are you going to<br>use it for and health but in reality<br>will you use it and also you know is it<br>going to actually meet your objective so<br>talking to people running out doing a<br>bit of research more the spectacle makes<br>you work for you and what you're trying<br>to achieve those sorts of things does<br>anyone have a media plan yep all to<br>people it's fun cool yep and also just<br>deciding also who do you want to talk to<br>you as well you know who's going to be<br>your audience that you want to reach out<br>to and that whole mixing personal and<br>professional so do you want them tangled<br>up or do you want to keep them very<br>separate ok so we've talked a bit about<br>branding personal branding and when it<br>comes to social media what we're trying<br>to do is protect our brand so everything<br>that you put out there is going to be<br>seen it actually says stuff about you<br>without you knowing it's like when you<br>please go for that job interview the<br>first thing people going to see is you<br>and what you're wearing and it's the<br>same with a bit like social media how<br>you're going to come across everything<br>you say every single photo that's going<br>to speak volumes about who you are in<br>your personal brain which is why you<br>need to be really careful about<br>protecting it and so things like you<br>know images colors and what you say you<br>know slagging off your previous employer<br>as you all know hopefully is there's not<br>a not a good look and it's not going to<br>do your personal brand any good<br>especially if your boss is also your<br>friend on Facebook and you forgot for<br>example which has happened defriend that<br>person so yes everything you know you've<br>got to think yourself as a brand like<br>from now on you are around everything<br>say do we put out on social media your<br>CV covering letter all that sort of<br>stuff that's going to speak volumes<br>about who you are as a brand because<br>you're going to be out there on public<br>display yeah I like this quote I think<br>that sums it up really well<br>basically in terms of your profiles you<br>want to showcase your talent sort of<br>your values your strengths what you're<br>good at so all of those factors there<br>basically make up your brand your brand<br>your personal brand when it comes to<br>work will be a bit different from your<br>personal brand when it comes to friends<br>and family but even with them you do<br>have an image that they've formed of you<br>based on some of these things and other<br>things as well so from a work point of<br>view you're actually trying to showcase<br>all of these things you can specially do<br>this on LinkedIn as well they make quite<br>easy for you to upload the CV and show<br>you off your skills and things like that<br>in terms of employers they do actually<br>scream job applicants once again steps<br>are a little bit you know but it gives<br>you a really good idea so 70 bucks per<br>send they'll go on to facebook<br>53-percent Twitter 48-percent link done<br>I think that's much higher now so they<br>do check you out in terms of their<br>hiring process in which phase it's after<br>receiving an application would be<br>forty-seven percent four percent right<br>before making an offer so they're taking<br>you out yeah so in terms of rejecting<br>candidates eleven percent post it an<br>appropriate photos so these photos and<br>appropriate comments love it I just lied<br>about their qualifications but the flip<br>side is that can work on your favor as<br>well so thirty-nine percent they gave a<br>positive impression of your personality<br>and organizational fetch so just briefly<br>touch the 60s so it's it's not just<br>having the profile having a static<br>profile and doing nothing about it you<br>need to join groups and engage in the<br>conversation as well I know it's that<br>time thing isn't it yep so that's why<br>the plan comes into so you need to think<br>about where your time has been keeping<br>your profile up to date ask and answer<br>questions be strategic about who you<br>accept onto your profiles we talked a<br>little bit about that and then posting<br>regularly for different people let all<br>mean different things like you know<br>multiple times a day once a week<br>in terms of what you post about think<br>about what you're really interested in<br>what your passions are and also which<br>ones do you have a good understanding of<br>that means that you'll be able to<br>contribute something to the discussion<br>it doesn't mean you have to be an expert<br>but you know you can contribute to the<br>discussion and then think about what<br>actually excites you so you would want<br>to post about it at 2am if you happen to<br>be awake at that time and then also<br>think about how they complement your<br>personal brand so in the circles they're<br>just sort of like social media there's<br>marketing Auckland food and wine history<br>travel they all until link and overlap<br>so if you're trying to grow your<br>networks you'll try and sort of connect<br>that social media community to the<br>marketing community and combine them so<br>just a quick little thing about<br>Twitter's they're going back to those<br>circles so I've got social media their<br>marketing Auckland with Twitter they say<br>people will look at your profile and<br>maybe make up their mind about eight<br>seconds whether or not to connect with<br>you so eight seconds isn't a lot of time<br>so unlike some of the others you dont<br>have space to put in a lot of<br>information so what you put in the bio<br>is really important so that person their<br>beef heart has got marketing PR social<br>media consultant adjunct professor<br>history addict ever Drita art culture<br>buff fan of beer cowgirl boots and<br>brilliance so you get a really good<br>snapshot and a very short space of time<br>of what the cheese about then the other<br>one we were trying to figure this one<br>out when we're doing hmmm pet members of<br>Alyssa Faraday were a couple of dogs<br>nothing out new friends dogs cats humans<br>we love everyone I'm want to play for<br>speed yeah um we didn't get it either<br>like what yeah so you get a request to<br>connect with that person delete so your<br>bio for Twitter needs to be really<br>really really clear so Twitter is useful<br>for connecting a lot of people say it's<br>useful for connecting with thought<br>whatever that means its interest it's<br>actually really helpful for getting<br>information so I've got a friend who's a<br>writer so she just posted something and<br>Twitter she basically asked if anyone<br>knew about what happens when someone<br>stabs you in the neck yeah absolutely<br>and then I think it was a senior trauma<br>surgeon from one of the top American you<br>know hospitals actually almost instantly<br>responded and said you suck an answer<br>that question and then they went offline<br>and had a chat but before she actually<br>sort of she did actually check her out<br>to make sure that she was who she said<br>she wasn't she found a photo and<br>everything else that you can just send a<br>random question on Twitter and you'd be<br>amazed who actually will give the answer<br>so it's great source of information yes<br>so the trekkers hashtags so that you're<br>narrowing that down pinterest and<br>instagram next a lot of common ones that<br>we think of when it comes to our career<br>but if you think about once again going<br>back and think about your goal think<br>about who your target audiences if it's<br>american woman for example pinterest if<br>it's apparently English men so you think<br>about your users and think about where<br>they are if your users were sort of you<br>know teens you'd be on snapchat so you<br>do need to think about where the people<br>you want to connect with our Google+<br>predominantly men so it's things like<br>that so think about the users think<br>about their age groups as well and then<br>in terms of what to post you know these<br>photos so events so we could have taken<br>a photo with us to get on Instagram<br>office space even quotes of people who<br>inspire you lead reading list of books<br>so there are things that you can<br>actually do on these as well that will<br>help your career it'll help your<br>okay so what you can do with Facebook is<br>off by the way if you don't know if you<br>want to see what the public see if you<br>go onto your profile and where it says<br>view activity log and you've got the<br>three dots if you click on that and then<br>do view as you'll actually see what the<br>public see but if you want them to you<br>can actually fill out the about me page<br>so you could fill out the week and<br>education if you wanted for example so<br>you can use it to give them an<br>indication of you sort of person you are<br>from a career perspective places you<br>have loved family relationships you<br>might want to skip that one details<br>about you so you can fill out that<br>section and then it can be public so you<br>get a choice of whether it's visible to<br>the public friends or only me I don't<br>know why you'd do that but the other<br>alternative is to forget about all of<br>that and have a public page so a fan<br>page so the difference is if it's your<br>sort of its friends that's your pro<br>private profile but if you're liking a<br>page it's a public page it's a fan page<br>so on the left-hand comic and column of<br>your your profile there's actually a<br>section and caps that saves pages and<br>under that it says create a page you've<br>got like pages created create a page if<br>you click on create a page it'll bring<br>you to a page that looks a lot like that<br>with local business artist band or<br>public figure you could actually say<br>like be a business person a blogger and<br>author or see if there's a great big<br>long list so you could have your own fan<br>page and then you could put whatever you<br>like on their LinkedIn this is obvious<br>stuff so professional photos<br>recommendations but I find a lot of<br>people skip that's that step and terms<br>are getting recommendations from<br>colleagues and employers connecting with<br>a few people with a large linkedin<br>network means you actually have an<br>access to a really big network because<br>you have access to their connections so<br>that's been strategic<br>joining several groups and your career<br>field as well contribute to discussions<br>yep because I'm when you're contributing<br>because people often say to us you know<br>how can I stand out in LinkedIn and one<br>way to do those actually contribute to<br>those group postings so join a group but<br>make sure that you are active and<br>actually comment on things and if you<br>find an interesting article then post it<br>it can be just putting the Lincoln and<br>say that I just found it interesting<br>article about careers in our case that's<br>always a good thing to keep active and<br>just post things that's how people can<br>stand apart from this joining everything<br>you could also have your own website so<br>on the website you can have everything<br>connecting to the website you can have a<br>copy of your CV you can have examples of<br>your work so that's really powerful as<br>well so just general principles google<br>alerts so that you can track and see<br>what people are doing that's what it<br>looks like when you actually set up the<br>alert you can write in the Bardia what<br>you want to create the alert about it<br>automatically came up with my name think<br>about the fact that what you post<br>actually leaves a permanent record so<br>think about you know sort of in 20 years<br>time you know your family might see what<br>your part so yes you need to know who<br>owns your social media I want to<br>emphasize that and you can link it so<br>business cards for example you can link<br>everything to each other and that's the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
