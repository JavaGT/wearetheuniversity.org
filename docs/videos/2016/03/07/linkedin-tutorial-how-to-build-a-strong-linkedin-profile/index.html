learned that<br>LinkedIn is where you can build and<br>manage your professional network online<br>when others view you they'll be looking<br>at your profile so it makes sense to<br>spend some time on getting it right when<br>you click on the profile link in your<br>main navigation menu you'll be in edit<br>mode next to each section you're going<br>to see a little pin clicking on this<br>will allow you to edit the content in<br>that section for example here we can<br>change our location or industry in<br>addition to changing the content in each<br>of these sections we can change the<br>order of how things appear in this case<br>let's drag our summary down below our<br>job experience you've got complete<br>control over the layout so have it play<br>and to something that suits you from<br>time to time<br>LinkedIn is going to prompt you to add<br>additional information in some cases<br>they may ask you to add more information<br>about your education or professional<br>organizations so look out for these<br>prompts they're a great way to keep your<br>profile up to date over time as a<br>general rule the more of the available<br>sections that you make use of the beedi<br>of profile however don't feel the need<br>to add irrelevant content just to fill<br>things up information that you add<br>should be appropriate and valuable to<br>potential employers colleagues or<br>contexts LinkedIn searching is driven to<br>a large extent by keywords so try to use<br>the words and statements in your profile<br>that you need to have to have the right<br>people find you it should also be in a<br>tone that's appropriate yeah using<br>language you'd normally use so the right<br>words are important but there are other<br>ways to get the point across as well<br>using rich media like videos or pictures<br>or presentations are all ways we can<br>connect with people that are viewing a<br>profiles you will notice here that we're<br>given the opportunity to add media to<br>one of our roles if you have any<br>presentations video<br>photos that you want to add you should<br>definitely do so and there's a really<br>long list of supported providers from<br>YouTube for videos Spotify for musical<br>SlideShare for your presentations so<br>here are my top tips for must-haves on<br>your profile first up is a professional<br>photo so hidden shoulders is good you<br>know look the way people will expect you<br>to look in an interview you can also add<br>a background image in here I think it's<br>a nice touch to add a little bit more<br>personality to your profile this is your<br>headline statement and I suggest adding<br>a strong statement here that that isn't<br>necessarily your job title you should<br>have a think of a short elevator pitch<br>for you get creative it is really<br>important also to get your location in<br>industry right this stuff really does<br>drive search results so it's important<br>for it to be right at a summary section<br>that's human it reads in a tone that's<br>consistent with who you are and perhaps<br>provides a really brief overview of who<br>you are and what you've done in perhaps<br>what you want to do some advice are<br>other ways God as user summary the way<br>that you would introduce yourself if you<br>meet someone in person add as much<br>relevant work experience both paid<br>involuntary full-time part-time and as<br>much of that as you can same goes for<br>education IDI your skills to your<br>profile there's a really huge list<br>available here so type ahead and select<br>from that list perhaps you can look into<br>your coursework or work experience to<br>prompt you on some of the skills to it<br>have a good look through all of these<br>additional sections<br>edie languages Awards publications<br>courses up in the top section here we're<br>gonna get prompted on some of the<br>sections that we may not have filled in<br>so use these as a driver to add<br>finally you have the ability to add<br>contact information into your LinkedIn<br>profile ultimately it's up to you what<br>you want to share but if you're in the<br>game of attracting contact for a job for<br>sales or for building your network I'd<br>suggest you add an email or maybe a<br>phone number whatever you prefer<br>in here so at this point your profile<br>will be looking great for your network<br>to get an even better flavor for who you<br>are though you'll need to get<br>recommendations start subscribing to<br>content and start posting we're going to<br>cover these things in our session on<br>staying active though I say not mention<br>is that everything we've been talking<br>about doing with your profile is free<br>linkdin does offer some additional paid<br>profile options which we're going to<br>look at in our section on LinkedIn<br>settings now these don't change the<br>content you can add to your profile<br>I hope the sessions been useful take<br>some time to work on your profile and<br>keep it going over time I promise it'll<br>pay off thanks for watching I hope you<br>can do in the next session on getting</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
