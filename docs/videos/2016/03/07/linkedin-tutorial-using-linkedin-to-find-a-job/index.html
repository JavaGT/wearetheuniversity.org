using LinkedIn to find<br>a job you might remember from our<br>previous sessions that a couple of the<br>keys to leveraging Lync dinner building<br>a strong profile and making sure you're<br>staying active by building your network<br>and sharing information before you start<br>your job search this stuff is absolutely<br>vital so I suggest starting there recall<br>also that companies are using LinkedIn<br>to engage with huge audiences of<br>professionals one of the things that<br>they'll do is post their job vacancies<br>into the LinkedIn jobs network so let's<br>take a look at a couple of ways that you<br>can find them the first is by using the<br>job search you can use the quick search<br>bar here to type a word or words pet<br>search and you review the results use<br>these filters down the left-hand side to<br>drill down into more specific roles you<br>can apply or save the job to manage<br>later for the full job search and<br>management experience though click on<br>the jobs link in the main menu so from<br>here you can run a more advanced search<br>you can see jobs that you've saved or<br>applied for and you'd also see that<br>LinkedIn is suggesting jobs to you so<br>these are jobs that are being matched to<br>the information in your profile but<br>they're also driven by preferences that<br>you see here define your ideal location<br>company size and industry again if you<br>see a job you like open save or apply<br>from here now the application process is<br>going to be different depending on the<br>employer<br>it could mean applying with your profile<br>or uploading a covering letter or or<br>being taken off to an employers website<br>to complete an application form in all<br>of these cases though making sure you<br>have a sharp profile is vital because<br>chances are employees are coming here to<br>take a look at your professional<br>background on LinkedIn another way you<br>can identify potential jobs is by<br>visiting the company pages of the<br>companies you'd like to work for here<br>we'll see a couple of references to<br>careers in jobs first we're going to see<br>some relevant jobs<br>and then all jobs again we're gonna use<br>our filters to find the roles that are<br>right for us and we're gonna start to<br>notice that LinkedIn is suggesting other<br>roles for us here we see some of this<br>people have also viewed example remember<br>you're able to follow companies that<br>you're interested in if you follow zero<br>for example you'll get their jobs<br>directly in your Activity Feed this<br>thing is the third way to discover jobs<br>on LinkedIn in your activity fee you're<br>gonna get the jobs from these companies<br>that you're following and you're also<br>going to get suggestions based on your<br>profile and the preferences that you sit<br>up in your jobs page spend time<br>reviewing these and if you feel like the<br>suggestions are irrelevant you can also<br>tell LinkedIn where the jobs are<br>unsuitable just click here and choose<br>hide job for those of you that want to<br>keep tabs on jobs from your mobile<br>device consider downloading link duns<br>job search app you log in with your<br>normal LinkedIn credentials and you can<br>use the search you'll get matches you<br>can save and even apply for roles<br>directly from your mobile so that's<br>worth a look so job search on LinkedIn<br>is great there are loads of jobs to<br>discover however the way that companies<br>are hiring is always changing in a<br>growing number of roles are not even<br>advertised companies are using dedicated<br>recruiters to go out and find the right<br>person for the job at times by searching<br>on LinkedIn with this in mind I want to<br>talk about the hidden jobs Network and<br>give you a couple of tips to stay<br>involved making sure your profile is<br>accurate complete and looking good as<br>essential start there following<br>companies that you want to work for also<br>helps as recruiters are accessing these<br>followers as part of this search use the<br>company posts to research what's going<br>on and get involved in the conversation<br>show that you're interested and stay<br>informed you never know who's watching<br>another thing you can do is look into<br>your network and see who you know at<br>these companies connect start a<br>conversation maybe they can refer you to<br>a hiring manager or a recruiter so in<br>review your profile and your activity<br>are vital search<br>for jobs and companies and people that<br>interest you and put your best foot<br>forward whether there's a job advertised<br>or not the hidden jobs market is huge<br>and if you're not in the company's radar<br>you might miss out I hope this is all<br>been useful good luck with your job<br>search I hope you can join us in the<br>next session but we're going to walk<br>through a couple of the important linked</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
