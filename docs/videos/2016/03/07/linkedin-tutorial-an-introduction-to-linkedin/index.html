and that's<br>something we're going to look at a<br>little bit later so companies have<br>profiles on LinkedIn to provide<br>information on their products and<br>services they're gonna share news and<br>information on their employees careers<br>in the job openings people are connected<br>to these companies as employees when<br>they list a current position on their<br>profile now you can show interest in a<br>company by choosing to follow them we're<br>going to look more at this in a later<br>session but remember that companies are<br>posting jobs here they're using search<br>tools to identify potential hires and<br>the publishing content so it really does<br>make sense to look through and take note<br>of this stuff universities have profiles<br>- so these normally include information<br>about courses on offer their current<br>students and alumni you can follow a<br>university in much the same way as you<br>follow a company to stay up to date with<br>their news in a later session we're<br>gonna explore things like this alumni<br>tool where you can access all sorts of<br>detail on the LinkedIn members that have<br>studied at any University lastly let's<br>look at groups so a group is a<br>collection of members that are connected<br>together and in a discussion forum based<br>around a specific thing for example an<br>industry group or a set of event<br>attendees you can view these group<br>profiles make a request to join and then<br>get involved in the conversation<br>we can spend some more time looking at<br>your profile building your network<br>engaging with these companies and jobs<br>and groups and follow-up sessions the<br>last thing we're going to do here is<br>just take a minute to look more closely<br>at your Activity Feed this is where most<br>of your interaction with link dinner is<br>going to happen so let's have a look at<br>maybe there's a post in here from a<br>person in your network clicking on their<br>name or photo is going to take you to<br>their profile page maybe you see some<br>content from a group or a university or<br>company that you're following you can<br>also link directly to these pages from<br>here LinkedIn is also going to promote<br>content into your Activity Feed so here<br>we see some jobs that we might be<br>interested in you might find new<br>companies to follow jobs such as these<br>or groups to join sometimes you're going<br>to see something in your feed that you<br>want to comment on or like so doing this<br>is going to share it out to your network<br>and it's easy to do that and right from<br>within the feed we can like we can come<br>in so to contribute your own updates use<br>this share an update link you can<br>include text here photos or links to<br>external sites and contributing in this<br>way is a key part of staying active and<br>it ensures that people in your network<br>are thinking of you try to keep things<br>brief perhaps asking questions is a good<br>idea it's a great way to promote<br>discussion so in review LinkedIn is a<br>place where you can build a professional<br>profile develop your network discover<br>and stay connected to opportunities<br>that's all we're going to cover here in<br>this first session I hope I've provided<br>a useful high level overview of LinkedIn<br>we're gonna be going further in our next</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
