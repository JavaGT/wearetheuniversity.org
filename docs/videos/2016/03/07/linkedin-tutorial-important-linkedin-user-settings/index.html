about so to access you see<br>things you need to be logged in to link<br>them from your desktop on this homepage<br>hover over the photo of yourself from<br>the top right-hand corner of the screen<br>and choose the option that says privacy<br>in settings you might be asked to<br>confirm your longer than details again<br>here but when you do so you come to this<br>screen the whole host of options and<br>controls so up here in the top section<br>you can change your login password or<br>add and change an email address attached<br>to your account you can actually have<br>multiple email addresses attached but<br>one of them will need to be set as the<br>primary address with notification emails<br>are going to be seen there's also an<br>option here to upgrade your account to<br>one of the paid or premium options so<br>lots of the features across these<br>accounts are the same but there are<br>specific accounts for job seeking for<br>premium business for sales and<br>recruitment so this job seeker account<br>might be worth checking out as it gives<br>you the ability to send emails to people<br>outside your network to be a featured<br>applicant and gives you some more<br>insights on who's viewing you and who<br>else is applying for jobs you can<br>usually get a free trial month here too<br>so try it out maybe have a little look<br>and see what you think in the bottom<br>half of this page are a bunch of privacy<br>settings and I'd encourage you to carve<br>out some time to look through all of<br>these at some point familiarize yourself<br>with what you're signing up to I am<br>however going to highlight seven that I<br>think are particularly important so<br>let's start with this one turn on or off<br>your activity broadcasts this is where<br>you decide whether you want your<br>activity that has changes to your<br>profile following companies to be<br>publicised out to your network via their<br>activity feed so as they suggest you may<br>want this turned off if you want this<br>activity to remain private number to<br>select what others can see when you<br>viewed their profile do you want people<br>to know<br>when you've looked at their profile or<br>would you rather remain anonymous I<br>personally see the advantages and<br>letting others know I've viewed them but<br>obviously it's up to you and your<br>networking style be aware that if you<br>choose to view and complete private mode<br>you'll no longer see the details of<br>anyone that's looking at you there's<br>also an option here to select who can<br>see your connections do you want your<br>network to know who else you are<br>connected to remember your connections<br>may actually give you some credibility<br>during a job search though there might<br>be something you'd rather keep private<br>you decide we talked about filling out<br>your profile in our second session but<br>I'm clicking this link here edit your<br>public profile you can select the parts<br>that the general public can see in other<br>words the bits that people who are your<br>connections can see you might be happy<br>sharing it all or you may prefer to keep<br>things private the other great thing on<br>this page is the ability to set your<br>public profile URL this is a way to<br>claim an easy-to-read link to your<br>profile perhaps using your name rather<br>than a random string of characters click<br>the little edit symbol here and see<br>what's available save and you're done<br>you can then use this link on email<br>signatures on a blog or website or maybe<br>on your other social profiles under the<br>communications tab you can set how and<br>when you receive emails and<br>notifications from LinkedIn the one that<br>I'd recommend starting with is this set<br>the frequency of emails now this gives<br>you full control over all of the<br>possible emails that you might receive<br>from linked them as you get more active<br>these emails can really pile up so you<br>might choose to limit them here<br>particularly if you're logging in<br>frequently enough to stay on top of all<br>your activity anyway under this third<br>tab there are a host of settings around<br>your groups and companies and the one<br>which I recommend starting with is<br>asking to share your data with<br>third-party applications so I'd suggest<br>you read this to ensure you fully<br>understand it<br>are you happy to share your profile<br>information out beyond linkedin what<br>about sharing your information with the<br>developers that are building<br>applications on the devices that you're<br>sharing your data with that we've all<br>got different positions on how we feel<br>about data sharing so do what you feel<br>is right for you the last setting i'm<br>going to point out is under the accounts<br>tab manage advertising preferences this<br>is where you're going to give the<br>ability for linkedin to show ads on<br>other websites that are based on your<br>LinkedIn profile and LinkedIn activity<br>if you tick the box you will see ads<br>tailor the deal on other websites based<br>on your LinkedIn information if you're<br>not comfortable with that leave it<br>unchecked again ultimately it's your<br>call so I haven't covered them all but<br>it really is worthwhile looking through<br>all of these pages to check out all the<br>controls and there sit right for you I<br>hope it's been useful though to learn<br>about some of the more important ones<br>well that's the final session in the<br>series on using LinkedIn to build your<br>career thanks for watching in
