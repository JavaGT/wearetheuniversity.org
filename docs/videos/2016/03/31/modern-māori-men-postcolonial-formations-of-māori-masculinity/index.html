staunch, stoic, strong, and often silent.<br><br>But early colonial writers often talked of Māori men being very physical and more emotional, even more feminine, than the ‘Victorian Gentlemen’ they were encountering. <br><br>In this public lecture, New Dean of Waikato’s School of Māori and Pacific Development Professor Brendan Hokowhitu has researched what he calls Māori modernities, or how Māori have interacted, evolved or devolved in a postcolonial era, including in relation to masculinity.<br><br>For more information about our Inaugural Professorial Lecture Series, or to view upcoming

fighters early research was a<br>historical analysis into multi-sport and<br>rugby in particular and that in turn led<br>to his work in multi masculinity and<br>thinking about stereotypes surrounding<br>indigenous men he found out that<br>physicality was an underpinning idea<br>that was linked to colonial history in<br>general his more recent research has<br>been in multimedia and indigenous media<br>and how molding men are portrayed in the<br>media professor Hawker fee to has<br>written more than 40 peer-reviewed<br>articles and book chapters he was the<br>lead editor of

inaugural professor<br>lectures in this new format we are meant<br>to talk about our key research ideas<br>they spend our careers and give you some<br>key messages even though i'm new to the<br>University of Waikato is fairly<br>disappointed to hear that we are no<br>longer allowed to talk about our life's<br>journey and<br>a cool conference that I went to with my<br>nerdy indigenous buddies but the biggest<br>nono apparently is that we can't talk<br>about our cats the other notion of meant<br>to focus on is aha moments my research<br>career aha moments those existential<br>moments when I've exclaimed Eureka I've<br>found it hmm i can tell you when you're<br>an indigenous person working in the<br>field of post-colonial studies those<br>moments are very far and few between<br>indeed the moments that I've come up<br>with more like come on are you serious<br>and bloody help so I just wanted to<br>briefly talk about the my research<br>really briefly so I've looked into<br>sports physicality gender masculinity<br>indigenous critical theory and popular<br>culture but of course tonight I be<br>focusing on one area of that which is<br>well sport and and masculinity so<br>tonight I'll I'll do some some personal<br>reflections a little bit about<br>methodology I can see people are really<br>happy about that a section about<br>physical called physically educating<br>Jake and then also talk about Marty and<br>Victorian masculinity and lassie<br>tradition and existentialism so I'm<br>going to do all of this with my academic<br>work of course but also some<br>philosophizing and some poetry thrown in<br>there as well speaking of poetry I would<br>like to acknowledge my mother gain or<br>who is here who's a avid poet and she<br>travelled hit tonight to be with me with<br>her partner David also it took me<br>rangatira nalani she's here to my wife<br>is here that a few meet tonight as well<br>luckily she didn't bring the kids<br>because he'd be like all over the place<br>I should also tell you that i was born<br>and bred in a and scored a nap or turkey<br>we're both my parents for school<br>teachers however i'm naughty poking a<br>naughty pic and key market too also i<br>should forewarn you that this kind of<br>talk tonight kind of<br>is on narcissism you know that kind of<br>my life story but in my defense I am a<br>body man after all so here's the<br>narcissistic but that's me of course so<br>I'll start off the better poachy red<br>with cold Marty boy feat speckled with<br>blades of colonial green glued with jus<br>West water wet down from vogue kumara<br>mountains waft it up east from timona<br>Tim wanna new Akua anxiety and hbu<br>ambiguity madness so my physicality<br>begins as with many young boys of my<br>time before and after with rugby I see<br>morning dew upon my bare feet and legs<br>as my lasting memory of playing JB rugby<br>on Saturday mornings on poor tiki<br>college fields as my colleague ticker<br>who took an artistic the whip was cold<br>and exhilarating and with the right<br>skills that enabled evasion of captors<br>as they slid one way as I went the other<br>way towards greener pastures the feeling<br>i remember was one of liberation in<br>those moments where speed deception jus<br>in inertia combined to open up the space<br>for a headlong dash to the waste oil<br>marked tryline in the 1970s and 1980s<br>rugby was a central part of the<br>important key community and beyond i<br>compute a community that comprised of<br>equal parts descendants of settler<br>ancestors and indigenous ancestors i'm<br>not sure how it all worked thus thus<br>amalgam this rural community of effluent<br>and working-class pakia kids and marty<br>kids predominantly from a rural<br>underclass the history of colonial<br>disposition was not clear to any of us<br>except in our bodies freedom was an<br>embodied experience on a rugby field<br>that earlier had been part of a passive<br>lands dispossessed by canoe and justice<br>so let's go back a bit I want to firstly<br>acknowledge the work of renewing Walker<br>who passed away very recently he was<br>amongst many other things a preeminent<br>marty historian and an activist and he<br>was born close to a portkey and spent<br>his child<br>had their ends of course like a tool<br>here I want to draw from his 2007 book<br>for portugee mitre 40 the story of<br>factoria struggle to locate my brief<br>personal introduction in a bit of<br>colonial history in 18 this is a quote<br>from obviously from Walker's book in<br>1865 the government invaded reporter key<br>with an army of 500 troops to rest kitty<br>or potato a ho ho partisan of the Ottawa<br>tribe if I Couture here bore the brunt<br>of their invasion under martial law<br>including the looting and destruction of<br>property the wrongful execution of maca<br>maca for the killing of volkner the<br>confiscation of a porta he lands and the<br>confinement of the 511 to his<br>survivors of a native reservation of on<br>second class land at all puppy the<br>wrongful confiscation included close to<br>seventy thousand hectares of fur coat or<br>heal and that under the military<br>sickness scheme was taken up by mainly<br>settlers who as walk out lines became<br>the families the businessman and the<br>landed gentry of a poor turkey these<br>families and their descendants and the<br>descendants of maca maca another other<br> tool here they all featured<br>pretty prominently in my life being<br>raised in school dad put a tap or turkey<br>primary and then poor turkey college my<br>own left loved history told me that<br>colonization was not an abstract thing<br>for Marty people for me my mates whose<br>families ended up scraping in the state<br>houses of poor turkeys high street while<br>my other mates they owned multi-million<br>dollar dairy farms and cures fruit<br>orchards so 116 years after the invasion<br>was nineteen eighty-one I was ten years<br>old and looked forward to evading the<br>descendants of makkah makkah and the<br>prodigy landed gentry every saturday<br>morning it was also the year that<br>reporter keys one and only all black<br>Frank Shelford mustard on the all black<br>jersey after weeks earlier starring for<br>the Mardi or blacks against the touring<br>South African Springboks a toy as<br>shelford was called in to the All Blacks<br>starting lineup for the decisive third<br>test at Auckland's Eden Park<br>as you will all know the test has become<br>folkloric and New Zealand history due to<br>its violent protests around the game<br>including a plane that flew around the<br>park and peppered the field with flour<br>bombs and flees the tour split the<br>nation along ideological lines bypassing<br>racial lines in many instances with<br>Marty and Parker like both pro and aunty<br>the tour well those supposedly<br>protesting apartheid in South Africa in<br>the mold the mold une lead national<br>government the event signal New<br>Zealand's postmodern moment where a<br>decade of protest by by many groups<br>congealed to resist that rugby<br>establishment and oppressive<br>monocultural oligarchy a rugby racing<br>and beer society so as a ten-year-old I<br>watched the Springbok tour and followed<br>alongside a multi father whose passion<br>for rugby emulated my own my father's<br>bottom line that politics should stay<br>out of sport and supporting tour<br>contrasted my liberal and feminist park<br>our mothers stance against the tour<br>which align with discourses that sprung<br>from vervain centres and us in the US<br>and Europe the tour for her signified a<br>Broadus of suppression but my father<br>starts was not as simplistic as it might<br>appear born into a different era<br>educated at pulling our native school<br>and subject to various disciplinary<br>forms of racism he valued the inclusion<br>of Marty and rugby as a source of pride<br>rugby in particular was one of the only<br>institutions where Marty were able to<br>compete on a level playing field with<br>with Parker and I will outline a more<br>detail but throughout colonial history<br>it was a strategic Avenue into a<br>okay<br>so looking back it all seems like a fast<br>to me Marty and park here kids mauling<br>together on wrongfully confiscated lands<br>a mighty father supporting a racist or I<br>think these roots not only made me a<br>fairly confused we led but sow the seeds<br>of complexity that my research now Tim<br>stone pack it taught me that seldom is<br>life simple or even how it appears I<br>guess it was the murmurings of a<br>methodology concerned with how we<br>produced as colonized citizens I'm not<br>sure you could ever describe the<br>analysis of power as a our moment it's<br>more like a slowly growing appendage<br>they're kind of just takes hold of you<br>but there are two basic points I would<br>like to make in relation to power that<br>have helped in my research firstly in<br>particular a Shinto indigenous<br>masculinities typically we think of<br>power in terms of hierarchical imbalance<br>and oppressive vertical relationship<br>between say Parker and Marty or men and<br>woman the study of indigenous<br>masculinity is however enables us to see<br>power as productive in complex one of<br>the fresh and sites that enables<br>Indigenous Studies Michigan early<br>studies enables as it makes it possible<br>to understand power beyond the kind of<br>dialectic of a single binary or more<br>simply put indigenous mean have the<br>capacity at least to be both the<br>oppressed and the oppressor they have<br>been dispossessed in many ways due to<br>colonization but simultaneously they<br>have also gained access to power simply<br>by being a man with in a column colonial<br>system that has unquestionably been a<br>gendered project secondly when we talk<br>about colonization and Indigenous<br>Studies circles at least that is<br>typically described in oppressive or<br>suppressive terms for good reason but<br>I'm more interested in the productive<br>nature of colonialism how and why did<br>indigenous peoples become conscious<br>conscious subjects of colonization how<br>did Marty mean for instance interact<br>with colonization and modernity to<br>produce new forms of post-colonial<br>masculinity so does my belief that our<br>post-colonial indigenous subjectivity is<br>emerged from the confrontation<br>with death associated with colonization<br>Marty had to reconstruct ourselves a<br>culture in the face of death and when I<br>say death i'm not being flippant their<br>estimates that suggest from the 19th<br>century to the early 20th century that<br>the Maori population decreased by as<br>much as high as 90 percent and there are<br>other estimates that say well as low as<br>50 percent regardless it was commonly<br>expected by the turn of the century that<br>all Marty would die out over the course<br>of the 20th century again we often think<br>about colonization is systematically<br>oppressive but more than anything else<br>it was systematically productive I don't<br>mean productive and necessarily a good<br>way rather a strategic way given that in<br>order to survive colonialism Maori had<br>to become colonial citizens<br>post-colonial indigenous cultural<br>formations that is the things that multi<br>began to do when staring death in the<br>face with strategic industrious and<br>creative and multi masculinities were at<br>the center of that reconstruction so<br>that's power now I want to briefly talk<br>about genealogy as a method and I guess<br>again I apologize i don't think even the<br>atom methodologists among us could<br>honestly relate method to a 60-hour<br>moment but what i've done so far with<br>just a wee bit of help from others like<br>Foucault as work out a methodology that<br>attempts to comprehend the the nature of<br>power in the colonial context a method<br>that both niche and Foucault referred to<br>as genealogy now it seems odd to word to<br>use the word genealogy in relation to<br>power but I use it at least in relation<br>to the molecular descent of colonization<br>at the core of this methodology is the<br>rejection that materiality in the body<br>is somehow divorced from theory abstract<br>Thornton and history let us think about<br>genealogy as the past day of DNA the<br>physiology of colonization or possibly<br>in a last for a little license here the<br> a Papa of colonization where as<br>Foucault would say bodies are totally<br>imprinted by history the stereotype for<br>instance that Marty our physical race<br>produced sit in postcolonial ended<br>subjectivity whether that was in the<br>army and physical labor and physical<br>education sport and the laundry on the<br>farm and the kitchen or at the end of a<br>shovel an indigenous studies will become<br>hung up on representation<br>representations and anthropological<br>texts and paintings and postcards but<br>how do the sites of physical production<br>interact with these representations to<br>produce bodies sites of work leisure<br>domestic life schools and practices such<br>as eating cleaning and exercising how do<br>these material activities discipline the<br>indigenous body colonization wasn't just<br>me RAB strictest course Justin lead to<br>stereotypes bodies were produced in<br>relationship with the material existence<br>discourses were fleshed out so to speak<br>DNA was passed down and I was thinking<br>last night that this might be the place<br>where I lose people and people might<br>start nodding off but hopefully that's<br>not the case so I will go on to talking<br>about physically educating Jake and of<br>course I'm referring to take the most<br>hickey so yeah I want to discuss for the<br>next little part of my talk what I've<br>just talked about in theory Somali<br>people of my grandparents and parents<br>generation they acquired different<br>relationships to their bodies than the<br>educated settler's because native<br>schools in New Zealand firstly they did<br>not allow Marty to get academic<br>qualifications and secondly they trained<br>Marty and what I came to refer to as a<br>physical education and here I just want<br>to offer but one example of the<br>discourse of the day the headmaster of<br>ramadi boarding sorry yeah the<br>headmaster of ramadi boarding school<br>told the young Maori Party in 1910 that<br>Marty were not fitted to the various<br>professions he said and I quote about<br>999 out of a thousand could not be the<br>strain of high education and commerce<br>mighty could not hope to compete with<br>the Parker and the trades the Marty's<br>were splendid copyists but not originate<br>us as carpenters they would cope under a<br>capable supervisor but not otherwise<br>agriculture was the one calling suitable<br>for Marty's it was therefore necessary<br>to teach them the nobility of late of<br>Labor there's another example the<br>government appointed director of<br>education Thomas strong from the late<br>late 1920s the 1930s and he was<br>surprised and a third to find in some<br>schools Marty were allowed to learn the<br>intricacies of numerical calculations<br>and he warned and I quote the dark races<br>warned educating and encouraging the<br>dark racers to a stage far beyond their<br>present needs for the possible or the<br>possible future needs and that was a<br>fatal facility he said I think he was<br>obviously less concerned about the fsm<br>we are and so so it was that at least<br>two generations of Marty trying to<br>understand what it meant to be a New<br>Zealand citizen we're often home making<br>building furniture making cooking and<br>child rearing as a staple curriculum and<br>native district secondary schools also<br>with no sort of school certificate as I<br>said pupils could not gain<br>qualifications and thus they couldn't<br>compete in the broader workforce through<br>schooling and then through manual labor<br>itself Maori developed a certain<br>relationship with work and with their<br>working bodies being a manual laborer<br>came to represent an authentic form of<br>being Marty this relates to what I was<br>speaking about before in the relation to<br>production of subjectivities in terms of<br>masculinity unlike Parker men who<br>enjoyed a normal spread throughout<br>occupational strata by 1965 and I quote<br>this code Watson nearly ninety percent<br>of mighty men and were employed as<br>farmers forest as laborers transport<br>operators factory workers or another<br>skilled and unskilled occupations the<br>result of educational policy throughout<br>the majority of the 20th century was<br>that Marty would generally far less<br>educated than Parker for mighty men at<br>the develop a debilitated them and the<br>workforce and later led to an urban<br>underclass that was the catalyst for the<br>okay I wish I had a moment to pull out<br>now but can't find one let's talk<br>instead about New Zealand's most<br>favorite exports one of New Zealand's<br>most favorite exports I'm not talking<br>about dried powdered milk products<br>Hamilton I'm talking about director<br>Nicky carriers film Whale Rider so we're<br>Ida tells the story of a young gil pikia<br>who demonstrates many leadership<br>qualities but patriarchal tradition<br>supposedly prevents a grandfather pucker<br>from seeing pike here as the naturally<br>future leader of their ewee and a new<br>way I might add that has many strong<br>woman leaders in this part of my talk I<br>want to discuss not so much the films<br>and accuracies or they're plenty rather<br>like once were warriors is not so much<br>that men like Jake the muscle pakka do<br>not exist rather it as the privilege as<br>authentic representations of mighty<br>masculinity I'm most concerned with<br>sorry so the unfortunate things about<br>films like whale rider is that they<br>promote simplicity uninformed audiences<br>lose the distinction between the real<br>and the imaginary as one international<br>film reviewer suggested and a quote<br>director Nikki Cara shows a genuine<br>sympathy for the traditions of the<br>conservative patriarchal society who<br>film describes we come to appreciate the<br>rhythms of village life excuse me and I<br>guess this was the theme of a plethora<br>of various reviews about the film it was<br>a sexy film because coming of age but<br>also supposedly a coming of age of a<br>backward indigenous culture yet a<br>genealogical analysis of Marta me and<br>and patriarchy tells a far different<br>story the production of so-called<br>traditional male patriarchy via<br>colonization is a much more complex tale<br>than Kara has us believe admittedly it<br>would make for a pretty boring film she<br>was going to tell that story but it's<br>beside the point and and as<br>comprehensive discussion on pre colonial<br>and postcolonial mighty masculine<br>leadership mahad Iowa nieta outlines in<br>his 1967 book the changing role of the<br>the leader in modern society the kind of<br>inculcation of settler technologies and<br>methods of government within the chiefly<br>habits that's what he calls so this is a<br>quote the period and he's related to<br>1800 to 1840 as important as showing<br>traditional leaders keenly and actively<br>experimenting and the dealings with<br>Europeans the result was a general<br>widening and the horizons of the Chiefs<br>they now had before them a range of<br>European goods techniques codes systems<br>of value and institutions to consider so<br>as I've already stated late later in the<br>19th century it was a matter of survival<br>in terms of producing masc cultural<br>formations that could actually interface<br>and be effective with the largely<br>patriarchal colonial state maharani Otto<br>also makes it clear that Marty leaders<br>recognize the need for their political<br>bodies to include educated Marty men<br>whose Western education would enable<br>them to interpret and then help<br>administer Parker governance structures<br>the colonial policy of creating a<br>cultural divide between generations and<br>the increasing desire of Marty to be<br>able to converse with the colonial<br>system mean meant that at least a<br>significant portion of my team leaders<br>were schooled in Victorian style<br>boarding schools as a strategy these<br>leaders traditionalized the hybrid form<br>of masculinity that was part marty and<br>part Victorian it is important to<br>realize therefore that the hybrid<br>culture Marty produced was in<br>conjunction with the very particular<br>form of settler culture that we would<br>not even really consider to be Parker<br>culture today dominant forms of<br>Victorian masculinity were focused<br>around the rational achievement of mind<br>and body as John Byrne on outlines<br>reason and feeling was separated and<br>masculinity came to be associated with<br>the objective in the the practical<br>Victorian culture was in general store<br>achill with cleared gender division<br>lines determined by heterosexuality male<br>leaders of this time were also highly<br>concerned that the masculine would be<br>contaminated or made weak by the<br>feminine in turn the famous British<br>public<br>school system explicitly used sports<br>such as cricket and rugby to inculcate<br>boys with values of physical<br>assertiveness and stoicism in New<br>Zealand colonial authorities created<br>Marty boys private boarding schools an<br>attempt to recreate a mighty Gentry who<br>would eventually take those leadership<br>values back into their communities for<br>Marty it was a strategic investment and<br>to enable some of their boys to better<br>comprehend how the governor's governed<br>that enabled a very small segment of<br>Maori population insights into the world<br>of their oppressors this takes us back<br>to why Marty men in particular place so<br>much importance on rugby because it was<br>seen as inherently linked to leadership<br>attributes and more importantly access<br>to a park our world which remained<br>largely off-limits to most Marty the<br>hybridization of multi masculine culture<br>with Victorian masculinity produced a<br>stoic Mardi patriarchal figure who has<br>supposedly represented traditional Marty<br>masculinity as represented by of course<br>called a pucker and more recently in the<br>new film mehana in reality however the<br>cultural formation was strategic and<br>temporal yet I dunno what to paint Marty<br>Mina's without agency in all of this the<br>British society mighty face gave my team<br>in privileged simply because they were<br>men however it does not appear as if<br>mighty men were entirely resistant to<br>embracing this privilege it could be<br>seen said then that the traditional<br>ization of patriarchy was strategic at a<br>certain point of time but I question is<br>it anymore and so I ask perhaps<br>controversially who has now authorized<br>to speak on behalf of mighty people and<br>what forms of expression are even<br>registered as recognizable whilst there<br>is nothing inherently wrong with<br>tradition that is the fixated and<br>arrested nature of tradition when spoken<br>in relation to being indigenous that is<br>of concern this is especially the case<br>in relation to our academic history in<br>New Zealand where Marty culture was seen<br>to be dying out and therefore needed to<br>be preserved in academic circles the<br>anthropological drive to preserve Marta<br>culture<br>as has left a lasting impression and<br>academia and with an IT studies itself<br>that is often we have focused on<br>preserving traditions and the<br>authenticity of culture whilst giving<br>little thought in our research to the<br>here and now to the present to the post<br>co new formations of Marta culture to<br>the interaction of Marty with modernity<br>to the immediacy of Marty existence the<br>immediacy of just being of living and of<br>doing the the existentialism of Maori<br>culture so in conclusion the water flows<br>the water heals the water drowns waters<br>wet seeps like culture waters immediate<br>I like the water it doesn't tell me who<br>I am I want to conclude on a positive<br>note by saying that whilst mighty men in<br>particular receive a bad rap as deviant<br>and it is possibly patriarchal I guess<br>the hopeful point of the discussion if<br>you must it was that we have<br>strategically used culture before and we<br>can do it again what I find most ironic<br>about my research is that the central<br>aim of colonization in relation to Marty<br>masculinity was the divorce mighty men<br>from the culture which was seen to be<br>backward and to model them on forms of<br>British masculinity early<br>representations of mighty men portrayed<br>them as lacking the qualities of<br>civilized European men so I'm going to<br>read a quote by Edward Gibbon wait Phil<br>and this kind of really sums it up I<br>guess in terms of British stoicism but<br>also also the racism of the day he says<br>nothing can remind me more forcibly of<br>the monkey who has seen the world in<br>Ahmadi thus relating news here's an<br>encouraging said reader and swells each<br>man stance into Anna fear of state ok<br>this is seeming less positive then i<br>wont to originally imagined but the<br>point being that Marty men were said to<br>have woman like characteristics they<br>talked a lot where emanated were over<br>emotional and did woman's work even and<br>therefore they even wore women's clothes<br>and therefore in general were too<br>womanly and not stoic enough the irony<br>is that<br>any of these qualities are now<br>considered to be signs of masculine<br>maturity that is desirous for men to be<br>in touch with their emotions to be good<br>fathers to be expressive if colonial<br>history tells us anything it has that<br>culture is not frozen in time and that<br>we must look to Marty masculinities that<br>exists beyond the narrow space now<br>prescribed through colonial<br>constructions so in taking us full<br>circle I want to return to my to rugby<br>the style of mighty rugby has probably<br>be chained has probably changed recently<br>as rugby has become more and more<br>corporatized by the nzru and the teams<br>like the Maori team had been used as<br>more like kind of farm teams for the All<br>Blacks however and as probably possibly<br>lost now Marty teams of the past were<br>inherently unpredictable they had flee<br>as they say and this has kind of been<br>used to kind of racialized Marty as well<br>but this flare wasn't wasn't<br>unintentional and was continuously<br>developed through the history of Maori<br>rugby I'm telling you this because the<br>style of muddy muddy rugby intentionally<br>confounded the rational organization and<br>when at all costs that underpins New<br>Zealand rugby Maori rugby wasn't<br>entirely about winning it was about the<br>aesthetics of the game as Marty all<br>black to while he outlines and i'll<br>quote Marty play a particular type of<br>rugby it's spontaneous and exuberant and<br>rugby we celebrate the joy of living so<br>we're prepared to take risks and do<br>things just for the hell of it and our<br>day it wasn't whether we want to loss<br>but the way we played the game it<br>signals for me that even within the<br>historical oppressive nature of rugby<br>culture and New Zealand Marty men were<br>creative and guided by their own<br>philosophies if you would allow me to<br>finish the poem I followed his swagger<br>his bravado his claims to write so that<br>other other's bodies his assurance his<br>silent and staunch Clint Eastwood esque<br>Dirty Harry shuffled back to the rugby's<br>halfway line never completely though I<br>didn't follow him I followed him through<br>the Mayan to the haze enlightenment of<br>poor turkey stag and Baba eventually the<br>smoke cleared he's just an old
