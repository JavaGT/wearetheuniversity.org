He outlines a new, bold approach for resource companies to build sustainable, long-term value and maintain their licence to operate by ensuring a more equitable distribution of the wealth to all stakeholders.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>oh yes you should just like to<br>acknowledge the support ability to pay<br>to trust serious testing there are<br>speakers denied in a bright despite<br>living in California peter is a kiwi and<br>he's a Kiwi that's delivered to<br>consumers economic and social<br>development now configure as a senior<br>fellow at they give out information<br>included which is placed at the Killiks<br>commencement Northwestern University in<br>the Windy City Chicago he's also a<br>partner at the US based strategy<br>consulting to clear it up I marry our<br>partners are working on that which<br>apparently is a file agree so the Green<br>River clarity for clarity which we all<br>seek their lives like this is a business<br>strategist disabled through the years<br>experience working right across the<br>spectrum both originally the US Europe<br>PHP and so he is today I get the<br>pleasure of shivering Peter around the<br>tracks or Wellington the energy and<br>mining our stakeholders in particular<br>are within its shell and the usual<br>no here's our previous speakers to<br>enchant us grow up right so but the<br>contrast between meeting with business<br>people and then when officials was quite<br>might be Michael you can use with<br>enthusiasm lice anyway but that the<br>point is that I think Peter made a very<br>strong impression on on on business<br>particularly<br>and this message that we're going to<br>hear about tonight is very important<br>because might be wrong way business<br>working in a socially and<br>environmentally is possible so without<br>Thanks bezel so it's really good to be<br>here for the energy matters lecture<br>series and thank you basil and mentor<br>for allowing me to participate in<br>inviting me back back to New Zealand so<br>it's good to get back so what I want to<br>do today is really I guess walk you<br>through some thinking and notions that<br>we have and around a provocation called<br>for the resource industry and resource<br>industry is the minerals mining<br>companies in the oil and gas companies<br>and that is the necessity for them to<br>move from an isolated actor to one of a<br>truly integrated development partner<br>with society and what I want to do is<br>talk to you about what that means and<br>some of the work that we've been doing<br>with the industry and also maybe put<br>some vignettes from our discussions in<br>Wellington you say that were very<br>interesting sometimes basil was cringing<br>with some because I'm kind of candid<br>with what public servants say to me know<br>probably learning though I shouldn't be<br>right because I might get in trouble so<br>the first thing is what do we mean by<br>resources so it's kind of a general term<br>so just put a few pictures up there so<br>we mean open pit mining underground<br>mining shale gas shale oil and we'll<br>talk a lot about that you know<br>particularly because there's a lot of<br>discussion a lot of media coverage<br>around that and of course this<br>necessarily water which is you know<br>vital resource and if you think about it<br>the only resource that we can't survive<br>without there's water and we can do<br>without the rest so we talk around you<br>know the whole notion of the resources<br>and also the reconciliation of what<br>society wants to the supply of these<br>resources and I'm not going to share<br>with you any kind of bias towards clean<br>and versus carbon-based fuels that<br>that's not the discussion or climate<br>changing this because not what the<br>discussion is about so it's more about<br>how we do things to meet the needs of<br>society on a broad basis as an industry<br>so wanted to share with you four quotes<br>ok and these are for different companies<br>i want to just you know this aspect of<br>social licence and sustainability so i<br>want to level set that so when I talk<br>about social licence the definition I<br>and here too is social licence is where<br>Society provides a compact or allows an<br>organization to participate and be<br>active and whatever its offering a<br>product or service or an activity in<br>that region very<br>and that's distinct from the license to<br>operate licensed operators I do<br>everything legally you know that the law<br>requires me to do what my contracts<br>require me to do the social licence is<br>quite different and it's not something<br>that's in writing and it's kind of a<br>squishy notion and it's one that<br>company's particular in this industry<br>have a real hard time getting their<br>heads around and then the issue of<br>sustainability we talk about it not in<br>just a pure environmental sense it's<br>about social sustainability its economic<br>sustainability and its environmental<br>sustainability so we're not just talking<br>about it kind of green things so the<br>four companies here these are all<br>companies that intuitively understand<br>that the social contract is a very very<br>important element of doing business okay<br>so what we see the first quote is the<br>social contract between entering society<br>is fraying this is actually from Novo<br>Nordisk a leading pharmaceutical company<br>in the Nordic countries are acting upon<br>diabetes okay so they see the pharma<br>industry at the second quote is actually<br>from unilever from the CEO peter palma<br>okay the third quote is from the CEO of<br>anglo-american the third largest mining<br>company in the world and the fourth<br>quote is from coca-cola okay and I pick<br>on those quotes because if you look at<br>this whole issue of social licence and<br>sustainability I kind of think there's<br>four phases that you go through okay so<br>first and you see companies that all<br>across the spectrums and the first phase<br>is really what we would call kind of<br>greenwashing so they pay lip service to<br>the notions of sustainability and social<br>license the second phase of maturity is<br>then we go into CSR reporting you know<br>this is a world of compliance and<br>probably where most companies are stuck<br>in okay the third phase is when you<br>start doing these things because it<br>enables you to take costs out of your<br>business so if I lower the inputs of<br>water plastic etc so like sony has the<br>road to zero that actually goes straight<br>to my bottom line so it's kind of a<br>profit motivation and it has good<br>implications and impact on society and<br>in the environment in the fourth one<br>though and is commonly termed the Fourth<br>Estate as a term the Fourth Estate which<br>amanda shared with me yesterday which is<br>where companies recognize that they need<br>to act in a way to use it as a strategic<br>lever for growth and also to develop<br>their social contract with Society you<br>can what we see is this probably maybe<br>two dozen companies in the Fourth Estate<br>that are varying degrees of maturity and<br>you'll see<br>companies and exact leaders that are<br>different phases of understanding and<br>evolution if you like and around that<br>we'll talk about some of the forces that<br>are shaping this whole aspect of social<br>license so just show man who know who's<br>heard of and understand social license<br>was kind of in tuned with it okay few<br>people okay so hopefully will inform you<br>a little bit today about what it means<br>what some of the industries are doing so<br>what are the forces that are shaping<br>this first of all this very fuzzy slide<br>cord around investors so we spent in<br>august two days in the Vatican we'll<br>talk a bit more about that with 25 CEOs<br>from the resource industry oil and gas<br>and mining hosted by Cardinal Turkson<br>who's president of the pontifical<br>council of justice and peace and he<br>talked to us and we one of the things we<br>talked about was this investor activism<br>and there is a tsunami out there<br>somewhere that's going to come over<br>companies and we don't know when and<br>it's up to the industry to think about<br>do I wait for the investor activism to<br>hit me or do I act and take leadership<br>in the industry now okay and if you just<br>want to put that in numbers survey<br>Christian churches excluding the<br>seventh-day Adventists and what are<br>excluded but they are they invest 200<br>billion dollars in the stock market 200<br>billion out of churches and the Catholic<br>Church represent probably bout sixty<br>percent of that and they will<br>collaborate okay so that's a big number<br>then socially responsible investment<br>funds called s our eyes are investing<br>around a trillion dollars you can it's<br>1.2 trillion so far into companies and<br>then there's another about two trillion<br>and pension funds like CalPERS who are<br>more and more being asked through<br>government regulation to act in a more<br>socially responsive a from an investment<br>okay this is very important because the<br>Vatican told us that eighty percent of<br>public companies and nearly all resource<br>companies fail the filters that the<br>church's apply to them for investment<br>okay and they feel that's not okay so<br>they want to change that as well that's<br>pretty a stark statistic okay so a lot<br>of other industries are in the bad books<br>too so so it's kind of it's so there's a<br>lot of investor pressure that's mount<br>that will begin to mount so I think<br>that's an important thing to understand<br>because you know at some point money<br>the other thing I phone this this is a<br>big issue we have to and the industry<br>after that this hot we have to reconcile<br>to almost conflicting forces that are<br>going on and that is society's demand<br>for things like this okay an iphone<br>we'll talk about why that's up there and<br>a growing thought process is going in<br>bigger percentage of the population that<br>we can take oiling we can use carbon<br>based products we should stop mining etc<br>you know so we should stop all these<br>things but society is complicit and<br>asking for all these resources so if you<br>look at and this is a reconciliation<br>that needs to occur and there's an<br>education element so I mean they do<br>surveys in the US and it's the same here<br>most people don't know where electricity<br>comes from anymore really i turn the<br>light search and they don't know those<br>big trains that have black stuff in an<br>outgoing and burnt being burned for<br>cochlear for power so an iphone every<br>sense of the friend of mine at the<br>manhattan institute they did a study and<br>fair and came to the conclusion that an<br>iphone consumes the equivalent of two<br>massive refrigerators of power every<br>single day neyo born my iphone doesn't<br>do that but everything you do on your<br>iPhone is in the cloud okay there's<br>massive server farms at Google and<br>Facebook have who uses Facebook okay<br>good yeah we do so few people so every<br>time you're on Facebook that's driving<br>big Facebook server farms that are<br>usually housed in a state in the middle<br>of the United States that's one hundred<br>percent coal-fired or natural gas-fired<br>because it's reliable and it's cheap<br>because they've got a business to run<br>and every time we're adding and you know<br>we've got another billion iPhones coming<br>around the corner so that's demand on<br>energy and then we got a billion new<br>people coming into the unit of the<br>planet in the next 25 years and hundreds<br>of millions of people moving into the<br>middle class at want fridges tvs motor<br>vehicles they want our way of life so<br>this is a huge demand on steel iron ore<br>coal okay so so on one hand we're<br>demanding all these gadgets that demand<br>all these resources and plus they're 17<br>rare earth metals inside an iphone they<br>have to be mined okay demanding all<br>these things yet we're being very<br>activist against the very companies that<br>are trying to supply so yes so that's<br>really a reconciliation that needs to<br>occur in society and a education and the<br>other notion is there<br>yeah and I'll use electricity or powers<br>proxy for this is you know people want<br>for things out of their energy<br>accessible reliable affordable and clean<br>do you agree okay your energy boys on<br>reliable accessible sits in your house<br>you want to pay exorbitant manly for it<br>and you want it preferably to be clean<br>but people will trade out number four<br>for the first three they won't trade out<br>reliability accessibility affordability<br>for clean they won't there's a small<br>percentage of society that probably<br>would but the majority of people in the<br>developed world will not answer me the<br>developing world will not so that's<br>another reconciliation that has to occur<br>so that's a conversation that has to<br>happen okay and it's not an easy one and<br>you know so we'll talk about how you<br>know through creative coalition's and<br>and dialogue that we can bring people<br>that are antagonistic towards each other<br>normally into a conversation a dialogue<br>to try and solve some of these reconcile<br>these issues sewing so don't go through<br>your iPhone's away after this please the<br>other thing is this massive activism<br>that's happening your community pressure<br>it's happening so this is a picture know<br>who've seen this picture no you can get<br>to newseum this is two weeks ago in<br>canada five police cruisers torch rock<br>Canadian Mounties and full riot gear I<br>mean this was nasty and look at the site<br>no show guess it was all about first<br>nation tribes protesting about they<br>don't want shale gas production to<br>happen in their tribal territories for<br>these ones it was nasty was messy I<br>don't think Canada's had a right like<br>that in 30 years with that hand cruisers<br>torched etc so there's a lot of<br>community activism that's happening<br>because they fear some of the<br>uncertainties that shale gas has even<br>that's a huge economic multiplier okay<br>then we see all over the world you know<br>buddhist monks protesting in london<br>actually being you know beaten up i held<br>it you know and you know so all over the<br>world is the activism whether it's Burma<br>China Australia is activism other things<br>that are happening are you know<br>unilateral nationalization changing of<br>royalty and taxation arrangements and<br>countries including Australia South<br>Africa African countries companies<br>investing billions of dollars in a<br>resource and then the government turns<br>and says thanks we're nationalizing it<br>or thanks we think you're ripping the<br>country off with doubling your royalty<br>so and what that does is increase<br>massive risk and projects and investors<br>are getting unhappy okay so you know I<br>don't have to put my money in resource<br>projects so this brings another notion<br>and okay this is a provocation for the<br>mining companies themselves and we'll<br>talk about so i co-chair this effort<br>with the CEO of anglo-american mac you<br>define in australian they're based in<br>London anglo-american and he says you<br>know the problem is this the industry is<br>facing this massive issue and if we<br>don't resolve the issue as an industry<br>today what's going to happen is we will<br>not be able to provide at an affordable<br>level the resources humanity's asking<br>for to live the life that we are what<br>that means is supply shortages massive<br>increases in price okay and it is a<br>train wreck that's you know heading that<br>way if we continue to operate as an<br>industry in the way that's happened okay<br>and it's really about bringing parties<br>together so I put up you know every<br>presentation I said a social media slide<br>right I think that's important but the<br>point about this is social media is<br>enabled indigenous people around the<br>world to communicate to each other in a<br>very rapid manner so in the past where<br>all companies with you know it be apple<br>with their manufacturing in China<br>resource companies when there's an<br>incident it's out in them in the<br>Internet in a blink so companies have<br>lost the ability to spin control contain<br>whatever it is any insolent any in any<br>corner of the world does matter if it's<br>in the darkest corner of Africa up in<br>the backwards in Canada in province in<br>china that so far away nobody knows it<br>exists all these things are out and in<br>the media before you know it and it gets<br>bigger than this too so the First Nation<br>folks in Canada were telling us because<br>you're most of the digis people in<br>Canada pretty poor but they have I think<br>they have phones and had facebook<br>accounts and Twitter accounts and they<br>communicate with the mari's in New<br>Zealand the African tribes all over<br>Africa the aboriginals of Australia and<br>New Guinea tribes they're all sharing<br>stories how you going with that resource<br>company what's a good you know and so<br>they're sharing stories so they working<br>collectively to increase their<br>capability to negotiate with companies<br>and this surprises resource companies<br>how are these people in Africa getting<br>knowledge about<br>what we just did in Canada two days ago<br>how'd that happen okay and social medium<br>they're all surprised it's like so you<br>know it's kind of it's almost naivety<br>right you know like these people are not<br>going to be using facebook so and you<br>know Mary's are very active in that all<br>ue tribes I mean they're all very active<br>so something we as again all the<br>stakeholders whether the industry<br>themselves NGOs etc need to be very<br>aware of okay so what I'm going to do<br>now is kind of take you on so we at the<br>kellogg innovation network and your<br>basil mentioned that i'm a senior fellow<br>there the Callaghan innovation network<br>is basically a global community cross<br>sector across about 35 countries we<br>convene in different ways but what our<br>vision is to enable global prosperity<br>through innovation okay and we convene<br>in different ways and the kellogg<br>platform provides an independent no<br>hidden agenda safe environment for<br>organizations to come and join in a<br>dialogue and we embarked on a process<br>called the catalyst okay and we picked<br>on the resource industry first two<br>during this journey and that is to<br>through that platform is to create<br>creative coalition's which are very and<br>we'll talk about what those look like to<br>go into an entering a dialogue so we can<br>reconcile the differences understand<br>where everybody's coming from agree upon<br>an approach for transformation and then<br>move forward rather than fighting each<br>other okay find the common ground bring<br>them together and move forward and we're<br>going to talk about how we've done this<br>for the mining industry which start that<br>journey started in Brazil April last<br>year okay and we're about to them back<br>on it and starting in February the<br>michela campus in Miami okay and we're<br>doing it for the oil and gas industry<br>starting with the shale gas and oil will<br>talk about why shale gas is very<br>important so before I continue down that<br>path who knows what shape when I say the<br>word shale gas and oil who knows what I<br>mean okay well not everybody so here we<br>go so shale gas was basically its oil<br>and gas trapped in shale and the rocks<br>okay and you know and it was pretty well<br>assumed that we wouldn't be able to be<br>extracted for probably another 20-30<br>years okay but nobody told a guy George<br>Mitchell and Texas about that okay so<br>here's a wildcatter so he worked<br>people in the industry so he worked on<br>three technologies okay which one was<br>horizontal drilling okay when was the<br>process of fracking itself the fracking<br>is a really bad word actually been so<br>fracking and then the other one was<br>using geo software for understanding<br>what the resource body looked like and<br>he broke the DNA code of this so he<br>could do it at scale so essentially less<br>than five years the u.s. is the one<br>that's kind of impact on this with vigor<br>the u.s. is totally you know upset the<br>whole energy equation in the world okay<br>tremendously okay so you know to you<br>know within three years the US will<br>probably be a net exporter of oil based<br>products so we're talking like seven<br>eight years we've gone from importing 10<br>15 million barrels a day to shipping<br>five million barrels out natural gas is<br>dirt cheap okay three bucks of BTU<br>versus that twelve thirteen dollars in<br>Europe fifteen bucks in Japan so<br>competitive advantage okay but with that<br>has come a lot of issues okay and we'll<br>talk about those issues and I know you<br>know Europe's having a difficult time<br>particularly the UK with shale different<br>countries are looking at it and I know<br>there are potential shale deposits in<br>this country as well and you're in<br>Australia its coal seam gas so big big<br>issue Sony what we did with the catalyst<br>as we as I said we started in april in<br>brazil so this is kind of a photo<br>vignette of the group we brought<br>together 40 leaders and when I say<br>leaders this included people from senior<br>mining companies junior mining companies<br>the United leader from the un-habitat<br>president of Oxfam First Nation<br>representatives okay research people<br>academics suppliers who supply to the<br>mining industry already like caterpillar<br>and komatsu companies that were looking<br>to supply to the mining in Surrey like<br>GE and 3m so this is a pretty holistic<br>group and was representative of yeah<br>most of the stakeholders okay we trapped<br>them in a very remote part of Brazil for<br>four days there was no escape okay<br>really I mean we're like 55 miles from<br>the nearest airport and there was a lot<br>of nothing between us and the airport<br>and it was really really constructive<br>and what we were able to do was<br>understand where everybody was different<br>okay very important listened<br>okay this wasn't about a lot of<br>presentations is listening and working<br>together and we listened and we<br>understood where the differences and<br>then we work towards is there enough<br>ambition in the room to actually do<br>something different and there was so<br>that group collectively went and the key<br>thing as many of them said you know<br>we're usually antagonists we usually<br>come into a room or maybe a courtroom<br>with you people you know in fight so the<br>fact that this was a constructive<br>dialogue was pretty powerful and this is<br>what the group collectively came up with<br>to fundamentally change extractive<br>business model the mining industry from<br>an insular reactive to an integrated and<br>practice development partner this should<br>mr. word using the framework during on<br>economic environmental and social shared<br>purpose that's pretty powerful you might<br>say well that's easy I mean anybody<br>could draw that up the point was is<br>being able to take these people that are<br>antagonist together on a journey to come<br>up with a solution since Brazil we've<br>had a working group meeting on multiple<br>occasions and this is some of the photos<br>from the work that we've done usually at<br>the camp so you actually meeting again<br>next week actually for two days some of<br>the company's mining companies Family<br>Foundation's like the MacArthur and Ford<br>foundations Oxfam eden project from the<br>future research triangles resource<br>capital which is a private equity fund<br>so again a very diverse group and what<br>we've been working on the last 12 months<br>is something we call the development<br>partner framework and then want to share<br>this with you because there's<br>application to the oil and to the whole<br>resource industry I think it's a lot of<br>app and based on the talks we had<br>yesterday and wanting a lot of<br>application to New Zealand and I think<br>because I really feel that the mineral<br>industry and the oil and gas industry<br>here is kind of added turning at a pivot<br>point I could go either way frankly<br>after listening to the conversations yes<br>there's a lot of disconnects going on in<br>here and I want to bring up this point<br>of creative collisions what what we do<br>at ken is which is really really good as<br>creative coalition's again that's a term<br>that I've unashamedly stolen from Pascal<br>Lamy last week so Pascal lamb is the<br>former head of the WTO a career public<br>servant 30 40 years in civil service and<br>governor national government<br>international bodies he succeeded Mike<br>Moore former New Zealand Prime Minister<br>and now the US ambassador<br>and what he said last week quoted was to<br>say that and this is amazing from whom<br>he said that he no longer believes that<br>governments and international bodies are<br>able to solve the intractable problems<br>facing humanity and what is needed as<br>creative coalition's that form that a<br>cross-sector and a self form based on<br>common interest in common passion to<br>change and once they've created the<br>roadmap of whatever it is they<br>disassemble themselves is that they stay<br>together to become monolithic and open<br>to self-interest and lobby groups etc<br>it's a very powerful statement from him<br>he's a very sharp guy and so he that<br>taken came out of a group he convened at<br>the Martin school at the Oxford<br>University about how we're going to<br>solve the intractable problems facing<br>humanity so and i'm a total believer i<br>mean i have total I have zero confidence<br>and government at most levels except<br>city level okay national and state level<br>and silly intl ways to resolve anything<br>because it always gets dumb down to the<br>lowest common denominator I mean I can't<br>resolve something one of the former<br>speakers here so neat antoni Brenton<br>great friend we had him out at the kin<br>after we connected after this I mean he<br>says you know I mean climate changes the<br>single bloodiest embarrassment on the<br>globe our inability through the UN and<br>other mechanisms to actually come up to<br>any conclusion he said there's no one<br>country to blame because he said<br>everybody is operating in their own<br>self-interest and when that happens you<br>can't get agreement so it's a very<br>disappointing and then you might say<br>what in the world were we doing at the<br>Vatican who thinks that so his kind of<br>you wake so what happened in Brazil is<br>quite funny actually so all talking and<br>was Anna lecture theatres of a tiered<br>seating and the president Oxfam ray you<br>know one of those silent moments you get<br>in a group says why don't you guys go to<br>the Vatican they never liked end and<br>looked around what are you talking about<br>and he said well they're actually very<br>activist all around the world and they<br>don't like what you guys are doing okay<br>and in Latin America they're very out<br>front anti the industry not anti-mining<br>aunty the industry what you're doing in<br>Africa working behind the scenes in all<br>countries the Catholic Church's through<br>different religious orders and Catholic<br>NGOs are working<br>support their communities to get a<br>better deal and they don't like the<br>outcomes that are occurring due to the<br>mining and oil and gas industry is very<br>negative so through a series of meetings<br>with Cardinal Turkson in Rome we<br>convened the CEOs and Chairman's of all<br>those companies okay we represent about<br>thirty percent of the total revenue of<br>the resources industry and we had a day<br>of reflection and what a day of<br>reflection was I mean we stayed actually<br>just from a personal note it was made we<br>stayed in Santa Marta Hotel which laid<br>people don't stay in normally it's<br>inside the Vatican the Pope was one<br>floor above us because he lives in the<br>hotel because want to go to the papal<br>palace he had breakfast next to us table<br>next door walking around me very humble<br>person so that was kind of amazing kind<br>of experience but you know we actually<br>talked about how what are the problems<br>that we have we listen to church people<br>that on the ground in Latin America<br>Australia Africa about what they see is<br>very very powerful and we had you know<br>CEOs that were you know spiritually<br>moved through the process they said that<br>they became very vulnerable through the<br>process so what they now do in their<br>companies is another issue right but i<br>think we move the ball down the field<br>and recognition that something has to<br>happen the Vatican users language called<br>faith based okay so it's not about we<br>need to be like Catholic so we need to<br>be Christian they say how do we do<br>things in a faith-based way which is<br>basically translates into doing the<br>right thing particularly for the<br>disadvantaged people where a lot of<br>these projects are operating and so so<br>again this was part of the industry<br>engagement that we had you know case<br>plans so you got to take people on a<br>journey if you want to change an<br>industry okay which leads us to this<br>this is kind of 12-step program okay for<br>changing an industry so the form of the<br>future made it six steps because I guess<br>12 steps is to either too long or too<br>controversial so the first step like 12<br>steps is you have to recognize you've<br>got a problem ok so I would say the<br>mining industry believed 18 months ago<br>it's got a problem but not the whole<br>industry it's can get a whole industry<br>to move one leader one CEO Mark Cutifani<br>said we have to change him he was brave<br>enough to step out of his industry and<br>say we are failing society doesn't<br>languages we are failing on our<br>obligation to society we need to change<br>the industry or somebody will change the<br>industry for us and we won't like the<br>outcome okay so you need a leader to<br>step out<br>okay and in the case of oil and gas<br>baker hughes who joined us in this<br>process have also had the same wake-up<br>call and they have decided through their<br>CEO and these people go to their boards<br>to ask is that a okay to do this because<br>they're going to start using language<br>that a lot of their peer group don't<br>like so baker hughes is willing to step<br>out of the gang and say in the area of<br>unconventional oil and gas shale oil and<br>gas we are failing society again as an<br>industry we need to transform ourselves<br>otherwise this is a train wreck okay and<br>the problem is the the big oil companies<br>have been involved in shale gas because<br>it's a very entrepreneurial activity<br>initially SAT back as well that doesn't<br>affect us they'll kill themselves but<br>there is blowback because people don't<br>distinguish one oil company from the<br>other so BP and shell and all that are<br>recognizing that if things go bad in<br>shale gas and oil it's going to blow<br>back on them as well so they've become<br>interested so we're at with the mining<br>industry is we're kind of round creating<br>pioneering practices and we'll walk<br>through that now and with the oil and<br>gas industry in February going to start<br>the steps one and two okay such a<br>journey okay you show them the what you<br>show them the well-known it's up to each<br>company to drink from that well or not<br>and I'll tell you why and when we get<br>through this as to why you know once<br>certain companies start adopting things<br>and doing things differently it becomes<br>a competitive advantage and when a<br>company has a competitive advantage<br>other companies begin to change because<br>they start losing business as a result<br>so this very nice diagram so this is the<br>development partner framework okay and I<br>want to focus on two areas here one is<br>those three bright green areas shared<br>purpose flourishing ecosystems and<br>competitive communities and talk a<br>little bit about each of those and these<br>are fundamental to a social license okay<br>and then some of the things around<br>enabling companies to do this so shared<br>purpose is really the notion of you<br>don't do anything to you have all the<br>stake you convene all the stakeholders<br>so in New Zealand's close to be all the<br>Maori tribes communities national NGOs<br>international NGOs all levels of<br>government from you know Wellington<br>through to regional councils to the<br>mining companies suppliers business but<br>you know everybody in a room not<br>hall meeting not like this round the<br>table and you figure out what is the<br>shared purpose for this project and you<br>sit there and sit there till it's done<br>you don't start and the reason you do<br>this is because that it takes all the<br>company's perspective takes all the<br>risks out of the project is what happens<br>is when this isn't resolved you get all<br>this activism that just adds massively<br>to the cost of projects delays projects<br>by years so this is very very important<br>from a company's perspective to happen<br>and it's important for the indigenous<br>people because they have their issues<br>put on the table and the other nation<br>and within this kind of process is the<br>notion of conflicting rights so we have<br>to change or reconcile the conflicting<br>rights so it's an interesting 10 google<br>it but certain examples of conflicting<br>rights are for example ownership versus<br>stewardship so easily western mining<br>company even chinese going we you know<br>we own the resource whereas the Mary's<br>most tribal indigenous people are<br>custodians of the land and that's a<br>whole different notion okay economic<br>advantage versus preservation of the<br>multi-generational spiritual and<br>practices of a community and this is not<br>just indigenous people this is about<br>communities that have like four five<br>generations found in the united states<br>in the Midwest so this is about that<br>economic gain versus you know what's in<br>the community okay it's about who's at<br>the table versus the under represented<br>and the poor people okay so it's all<br>those conflicting rights if get to aim<br>the list is quite long so you have to<br>decide what are they and then work<br>through them very very important okay I<br>think this also provides a framework and<br>a platform so when you do have issues so<br>I learned in New Zealand when you have<br>an issue you go straight to court okay<br>you have a descrip don't go to<br>arbitration don't have a meeting get<br>caught because that's the way the acts<br>are set up and then you said in court<br>for five years I mean that's what I mean<br>that's not good for the company it's not<br>good for the mari's it's not good for<br>the communities and it's not good for<br>the country I mean that's ridiculous<br>sexually have you Frank you know but you<br>know that's the way the laws set up so<br>and note explaining to me wedding that's<br>why one in seven people in Wellington<br>lawyers right or something professional<br>people<br>I mean I thought that only happened in<br>the US but you know i mean the court is<br>the place of last resort not the place<br>you go to resolve initial dispute so<br>that's what happens in fact it's so it's<br>almost like they say we're going to have<br>to switch so let's just go to court you<br>know I mean fit so it's kind of kind of<br>ridiculous to me flourishing ecosystems<br>this is this whole issue of biodiversity<br>water okay that's one other big thing is<br>resources suck water do you take water<br>out of the food supply system and<br>therefore threaten food security okay so<br>this is the notion that when a resource<br>projects taps this is not about you<br>clean up and make it as good as or<br>better than it was when you arrived it's<br>about you make the environment better<br>from day one okay among the nations and<br>shared purpose is we want resource<br>companies and community stop thinking in<br>terms of life of resource because most<br>companies do a life of resource plan and<br>when the resources depleted that's the<br>end of the plan weakening so what we're<br>asking them to think an extreme 100 year<br>plan you need to think 10 20 30 years<br>out beyond when the resources depleted<br>what are you going to be doing and<br>that's putting a responsibility back on<br>the mining company and the oil and gas<br>company it's a big deal okay but i think<br>the leading companies and you know we<br>met with some of them yesterday I think<br>there are people there are leaders in<br>New Zealand all around the world that<br>are willing to do this and they need to<br>because they recognize the need that has<br>to happen if they want to get done what<br>they want to so we're important an<br>example that happened in South Africa<br>which is kind of around you know<br>conflicting right so this is amazing<br>because it's the South African company<br>so you think they know better so they<br>developed a mine in a village during the<br>community and there's a store and so<br>they've called pick and pay so<br>supermarket I woolworths etc it would it<br>be one of we put a pic and paste or hair<br>and and everybody will have choice I put<br>the pic and paste or in the town<br>supplied all their goods from somewhere<br>else and they totally destroyed the<br>livelihoods of all the villagers who are<br>doing you know cottage farming and so<br>the actually after one year of pick and<br>pay the community was worse off<br>dramatically worse off than it was<br>before pick and pay arrived so our<br>notion of I you know Gavin products and<br>blah blah they hadn't thought about it<br>so they should have been sourcing a lot<br>of their products from the local farmers<br>okay but that's not how pic<br>pay things so I mean that's just a<br>little example of you know how these<br>things can really throw out because i<br>love the Verge's they don't want pick n<br>pay's they just want to keep doing what<br>they do so what's the nation of<br>prosperity to us may not be the notion<br>that other people have so we've got to<br>be careful of that and the last one is<br>this whole idea of competitive<br>communities companies and countries this<br>is an obligation on the company to work<br>with society to make sure that when the<br>resources finished and depleted what<br>remains as a country that has<br>competitive infrastructure that has<br>communities that are competitive<br>educated and that accompanies that are<br>competitive what happens today normally<br>is either you import the load like<br>Chinese really bad ok so Greenland has<br>just approved the which is pretty<br>shocking because the economy's kind of<br>tanked an iron ore mine in Greenland and<br>they've done it to the Chinese and they<br>really excited but the Chinese going to<br>import 7,000 workers that's really yeah<br>into green land to do so no jobs for the<br>locals okay so that's not really that<br>competitive but the whole thing is that<br>you know what happens when the resources<br>depleted is the ecosystem usually<br>collapses because it's geared for that<br>resource so we're turning that notion<br>around and saying you need to actually<br>build industry and infrastructure that's<br>not just tied to your company and you<br>need to think thoughtfully about how you<br>do that and we're saying that it's not<br>good enough to write the royalty check<br>to the government and then say we've<br>done our business we sent the hundred<br>million dollars to the government and<br>we're facing it to Switzerland spend it<br>on the army and don't give it to the<br>committee that's not our business that's<br>the wrong thinking okay and plus most<br>communities connect the company with the<br>government and you are complicit in the<br>government squandering the funds so<br>interesting discussion in Wellington<br>yesterday it's kind of shocked me<br>government department not to be<br>mentioned thank you special as I said<br>you're doing this big development in<br>Taranaki and yes Taranaki is the richest<br>you know province in New Zealand so I'm<br>told and me and I said well what about<br>this notion of you know takes on the<br>royal you know the royalty flow tax flow<br>from the oil and gas production and<br>applying it to the community I know I<br>can't do that wouldn't do that couldn't<br>put in a Regional Development Fund it's<br>got to go into general revenue and then<br>we apply to the poor regions not just<br>you know<br>and we and then I heard from other<br>sources then the government says and<br>then you'll get trickled down which<br>nothing ever trickles down okay it just<br>doesn't happen and I'm just like God I<br>mean so poor people in Taranaki is you<br>know they the ones with the resource and<br>all the activity and people go where you<br>don't need the royalties because you've<br>got the economic activity etc so that's<br>just false thinking so but the company<br>has to have the dialogue with the<br>government I believe with all parties<br>and say that is a wrong notion full stop<br>okay so starbucks is famous they did a<br>thing in Africa where though having a<br>coffee bean plantation and it was in one<br>of those kind of funky African countries<br>with a military regime and they said<br>this is fantastic we want you your<br>contract will be with the import/export<br>shipping company in the capital city<br>which was run by the brother of the<br>president and that's where all the money<br>will flow and suboxone I'm not doing it<br>the money has to flow through the<br>community I'm not doing this development<br>in two years and then the government<br>buckled UK and said okay so cuz<br>starbucks recognized that their<br>reputation was on the line with the<br>community that's who's going to<br>bad-mouth and Layton so they forced it<br>so resource companies need to take the<br>same approach and have hard discussions<br>with government and say that's not okay<br>in terms of operating that way so let's<br>go you know I think that's going to be a<br>hard discussion in New Zealand as well<br>you know Australia's squandered its<br>resource wealth of 10 years so what you<br>think being it's basically poured the<br>money down the drain okay and there's no<br>lasting anything in Australia I think<br>from your billions and billions of<br>dollars of royalty so it's disappointing<br>so it's not just a plague on developing<br>countries I because our tendency is<br>white people in the developed world errs<br>odds their problem it happens in Africa<br>it happens in Latin America but we don't<br>have that problem that's wrong thinking<br>as well so just to be provocative and<br>last we just want to talk about enablers<br>so the big challenge for companies as<br>they go even if they go yep we want to<br>do that oops we don't have the<br>capability to do it we don't have the<br>people with the schools we don't have<br>the educator should we even if we wanted<br>to do this we don't know how to do it<br>and the people that we have in the field<br>are not equipped and the people<br>universities are pumping out to us are<br>not educated in this way so it has to<br>change so there has to be this whole<br>notion of<br>I think of re-equipping of the education<br>both in undergraduate degrees in post<br>grad degrees executive education to give<br>capabilities to existing management<br>teams that are in these situations<br>because most general managers of any<br>resource project have no idea because<br>our engineers and geologists to have it<br>interact with indigenous people have a<br>have effective meetings etc so and they<br>just try and tick the box and then those<br>kind of propellerhead people called<br>sustainability people fly in from head<br>office for a week and then they vanish<br>got through the sustainability meeting<br>so this way and that's just you know<br>sustainability is has to become<br>everyone's job social licence has to<br>become everyone's job so again that's<br>the thing so one this is not going to<br>happen without CEO leadership this is<br>not a bottom-up it's not middle<br>management the CEOs have to step out so<br>Mack you to fanny's stepped up gary<br>goldberg CEO of newman is stepping out<br>Sam Walsh has got one foot out the door<br>from Rio Tinto of stepping out okay so<br>we just see these people Baker Hughes<br>the CEO is willing to stepping out so as<br>these companies change in mark has an<br>interesting thought he goes we will take<br>this framework and they are beginning to<br>apply it to the strategy and tactics of<br>anglo-american okay and to become a true<br>development partner model and he says<br>it's that interpretation that is<br>proprietary to my company so this is all<br>I open-source it's out there for<br>everybody how we apply it is proprietary<br>and will give us competitive advantage<br>and as and then we will become the<br>partner of choice for countries and<br>communities that'll start locking out<br>other companies so what happens as the<br>market forces work either companies will<br>change or the market forces will push<br>them out and bankrupt them because come<br>countries will not want to deal with<br>these companies that are acting like an<br>anglo-american or a baker hughes and<br>that's very very important so this is a<br>joint statement mark a knife silence in<br>our framework no rear to you'd say we<br>are asking leaders of mining and we can<br>say and oil and gas companies and<br>communities take an active role in<br>reshaping our future to accept that our<br>long-term prosperity depends on the<br>strength of our relationships with all<br>of our stakeholders to recognize the<br>extent to which we all have skin in the<br>game and to believe that we have a<br>responsibility to work collaboratively<br>to realize our shared purpose we are<br>calling for courage<br>reset the way we operate to be willing<br>protagonists and redefining our future<br>it's time for us to lead and it is time<br>for us to act okay so and he actually<br>says these words and investor meetings<br>analyst meetings wherever he is this is<br>the city keeps drumming this drum okay<br>and you know his company's taking it<br>forward so so just kind of wrapping up<br>it's really important I think for<br>effective development of resources that<br>this kind of approach needs to occur and<br>there's got to be a much more kind of<br>radical collaboration between all<br>segments of society all people have to<br>be invited in room in people like<br>Greenpeace Sierra Club that all almost<br>anti oil and gas and he mining they<br>probably won't turn up but they have to<br>be invited and if they want to come that<br>you have we have them in because you<br>know if you have Union you know if these<br>this is my provocation to them if you<br>sit in a room and you've got unions<br>communities mind all these constituents<br>going we believe in doing it but in a<br>certain way you know they either start<br>reshaping how they think or they start<br>becoming looking like dogmatic and<br>unreasonable people okay so in the case<br>of shale gas and oil in the u.s. you<br>have the strange situation where the<br>unions who are left-wing are usually<br>side with these NGOs with business<br>because they want these high paying jobs<br>75 to 100 twenty thousand dollar per<br>person jobs and we're talking hundreds<br>of thousands of people okay so unions<br>are over here saying this has to happen<br>okay and a couple of just kind of<br>thoughts is shale gas is replacing coal<br>in the United States okay and if you<br>look at the statistics it is going to<br>have the single biggest impact in<br>reducing carbon emissions United States<br>of America than any other clean energy<br>initiative and history or any regulation<br>okay that's pretty big i'm not talking<br>about substantial reduction the US is<br>actually carbon footprints actually been<br>declining in the last ten years okay<br>without any carbon trading scheme<br>because there's companies are doing<br>things state governments are doing<br>things what's happening in Europe has<br>been upsetting because natural gas is so<br>how they say they are shutting natural<br>gas power stations in Germany and<br>replacing them with coal<br>and they are actually going to have a<br>carbon emissions spike in the next 10<br>years carbon emissions in Germany are<br>going to increase over the next 10 years<br>because they can afford natural gas at<br>$13 Abby to you and because already<br>paying somewhere between two and three<br>times the price of electricity is the<br>u.s. is so it's starting to become a<br>competitive disadvantage for their<br>industry okay so so these are the kind<br>of things you've got and it's a very<br>complex world there's lots of moving<br>parts as lots of interest that you have<br>to reconcile lots of people you have to<br>listen to it's a journey we all have to<br>go on I think it's important for<br>humanity that we do and do this and make<br>it a success otherwise you know i do<br>believe there is a train wreck because<br>you know nobody's going to be happy<br>paying twenty dollars a gallon for<br>gasoline because there's a shortage or<br>there is going to be happy when you know<br>houses a triple quadruple or you sorry<br>we ran out of iphones you can't buy an<br>iphone for six months because we got no<br>rarest left okay or sorry all the server<br>farms are shut down cuz you don't have<br>enough energy to run okay so you know<br>we're going to get unhappy right so so<br>you know i think we all have a part we<br>you know we're all voters will all<br>people that talk to other people so I<br>think in New Zealand's situation I I<br>really think you know government needs<br>to understand that this needs to happen<br>and they are not the people that are<br>driving the Train on this one driving<br>the bus they are a passenger in the bus<br>like everybody else okay and that's I<br>think hearing the language and working I<br>think that's going to be a very<br>difficult thing for the New Zealand<br>government to get there wrap their head<br>around so we will see I think it'll be<br>an exciting journey to do that here so<br>so I'd like to thank you for your time<br>and attention and I'd like to open it up<br>for questions and very are any otherwise<br>it's your question saying between us and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
