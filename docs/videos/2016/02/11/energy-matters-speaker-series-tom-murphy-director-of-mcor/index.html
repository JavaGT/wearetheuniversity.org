remediation, workforce and business development, regulatory protocols, impacts to existing industries, the economics driving the process and global energy trends.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you for the opportunity and thank<br>you for the chance to maybe talk about<br>some of the things that we're seeing in<br>relative to shale energy development we<br>can see more broadly in our case<br>specifically when we're talking about<br>Pennsylvania and we'll talk about a<br>number of issues that really go beyond<br>Pennsylvania talk about this from a<br>global standpoint we do a lot of work<br>around the world will highlight some of<br>that but also we think about this from a<br>North American standpoint so it's really<br>more than just about Pennsylvania the<br>reason we often come back to<br>Pennsylvania's was just mentioned we<br>have a mission as part of our outreach<br>effort within the university system as a<br>land grant as was specified so part of<br>our mission is to educate the many many<br>stakeholders in a variety of different<br>topics this will be broken out because<br>there's been such a high level of<br>interest and not just within the state<br>of Pennsylvania but contiguous states<br>around around the Pennsylvania and the<br>many other places around North America<br>as we think about gas development that's<br>going on or again or shale energy as I<br>said previously so we think about a lot<br>of shale oil development that's now<br>occurring in a number of different<br>states and also when we think about that<br>we also move into western parts of<br>Canada and now into even the eastern<br>parts of Canada and then down into<br>Mexico and Mexico is now starting to<br>liberalize there are policies and and we<br>look to do more in terms of outreach and<br>stakeholder engagement and certainly<br>some of the technical components as we<br>think about that marketplace as well so<br>tonight we'll talk in the timeframe that<br>I have and hopefully we'll get some<br>questions in the end too I always find<br>the questions are the most interesting<br>and probably the most telling part of<br>the opportunity to speak with people so<br>we'll get to some questions and<br>hopefully you've come with some and if<br>not hopefully will generate some<br>interest here as we go through the<br>presentation talk about some things that<br>might be of interesting interest to you<br>and they're in the global context during<br>your certainly national context here in<br>New Zealand so we'll talk about number<br>of different points that as we go<br>through I always frame my conversation<br>when I start a lot of the things whether<br>we're talking about regulatory<br>considerations weather<br>we're talking about transparency issues<br>whether we're talking about social<br>license relative to this topic certainly<br>all the environmental themes we always<br>start that process by talking talking<br>about what are some of the economic<br>considerations that are driving that<br>process of moving it forward so we try<br>to to use that as a foundational piece<br>and we'll use that in the same context<br>here this evening but we'll talk about<br>some of the other components where the<br>technology is going quickly this is<br>evolving and emerging one is a new part<br>of the industry the unconventional<br>component again it's the same industry<br>players or largely the same industry<br>players but a retooling in a<br>re-emergence and a different different<br>parts of the world different communities<br>when you get down to the very local<br>level and also some of the technologies<br>that are coming to bear as we see this<br>going and then also talking about some<br>of the risks it's really this<br>conversation in a lot of different ways<br>is really about risk and mitigating risk<br>or managing risk as we think about again<br>the impact of this development is<br>occurring in a number of locations a<br>little bit about our center as our name<br>would imply we do research and we do<br>outreach again our mission from the land<br>grant system is to do the outreach piece<br>but outreach without nesting that in<br>good research is really in our opinion<br>is not necessarily the best use of time<br>it's certainly not the best use of<br>information so we tried it to couple the<br>two of them together the research we do<br>covers a variety different things I'll<br>just give you a quick showing with three<br>quick slides give you an idea what what<br>we consider we think about research and<br>some of the work that we're doing in<br>that regard but we break this down into<br>what's below ground or the down hole<br>consideration typically what's thought<br>of is maybe the more technical side the<br>more conventional part the drilling the<br>hydraulic fracturing the you know all<br>the other considerations that would be<br>attached in between those two a lot of<br>the lead-up work and we think about some<br>of the assessment of the resource as<br>well the seismic work but also the above<br>ground piece so we think about the above<br>ground considerations or above ground<br>risk as we often refer to them we think<br>about community impacts we think about<br>long-term planning<br>we think about utilization again<br>thinking about this ever a long spectrum<br>of time not just the development of the<br>resource but what are we going to do in<br>the resource down the road or how we<br>going to retool or reorganize and move<br>from one type of energy source or<br>multiple types of energy source actually<br>but we think about fossil we think about<br>oil and gas we're going to go from the<br>conventional side to this unconventional<br>side how we going to utilize once we<br>discover what we have and a number of<br>other ones that i mentioned workforce<br>business development mentioned about<br>governance we think about transparency<br>issues many many considerations that are<br>that are tied in with that some of the<br>other things that as we think about the<br>research side so if that's the research<br>angle and the piece that we do and again<br>we're trying to to merge the research<br>piece in the outreach piece but we also<br>we have a number of different entities<br>that are on campus that look at very<br>specific parts of this so we're a pretty<br>big institution as well we have I think<br>there's ninety six thousand students in<br>all of our different campuses together<br>we have 22 branch campuses and then the<br>main campus where we have about half of<br>those we have 500 researchers that are<br>working in some aspect of energy so it<br>might be hydrogen it might be renewables<br>it might be nuclear it might be in<br>fossil it might be fossil broken out to<br>coal or oil gas whatever it might be but<br>again a variety of people looking at<br>different components we see with the<br>unconventional is it's it's generated a<br>renewed interest or an expanded interest<br>will say even in the legal side so we<br>have our legal school we have a<br>component within the campus system that<br>is training the next generation of<br>attorneys we find out that they have a<br>very deep part to play in this<br>particular story we also have the social<br>aspect or social science research<br>institute we're also training with our<br>top core group or training regulators so<br>thinking about who are going to be the<br>environmental regulators or that the<br>governmental regulator is watching this<br>process over the course of time so we're<br>also watching and training them for 38<br>states in conjunction with two other<br>universities Cairo school mines and<br>University of Texas so again trying to<br>put a lot of emphasis into not just<br>where we're at<br>at the moment that where this moment is<br>going to expand to going forward so<br>definitely interest in that and then<br>just a quick snapshot of some of the<br>issues that we see from a research<br>standpoint a place that as a state and<br>quite frankly I think it's a list that<br>would be a national list and again quite<br>frankly I think a global list when you<br>think about what are some of the issues<br>that are attached to developing<br>unconventionals you'll see a number of<br>issues there again just kind of a<br>generalized list but you'll see issues<br>there that would be very similar to<br>conventional but there's there's some<br>nuanced differences that we've broken<br>out and we're looking at very<br>specifically we think about in this case<br>the development of natural gas from<br>shale or oil coming or liquids coming<br>from the same but a number of issues<br>that are points of interest to us places<br>that we're already doing some work in<br>places that we're looking to invest some<br>money coming from some of the tax<br>revenue and from some other sources<br>corporate interest into some of these as<br>well very specifically we start breaking<br>them down we start to look at places<br>like water and you can't have a<br>conversation dealing with<br>unconventionals and thinking about gas<br>development without thinking about<br>impacts the water either on the surface<br>the groundwater or thinking about the<br>ramifications of things like well bore<br>integrity and we're going to see methane<br>migration from depth or fluid migration<br>from depth and is that going to impact<br>water in whatever type again either<br>coming to the surface or certainly<br>impacting groundwater and the<br>interaction that that would have with<br>the communities or people that are<br>certainly dependent upon those same<br>sources of water over time so we spend a<br>lot of time teaching about that again<br>outreach to the broader communities so<br>that the broader public sout there the<br>many stakeholders we have and we define<br>stakeholders in a lot of different ways<br>not just talking about the the general<br>public walking down the street we're<br>thinking a lot of work that we do with<br>elected officials with regulators<br>themselves we teach a lot of industry<br>players about the industry itself as<br>companies are making transition from<br>maybe coal companies to oil and gas or<br>moving through the timeline from a more<br>conventional type of a company<br>conventional oil and gas into<br>unconventional so we work with that as<br>well again maybe just to finish out the<br>list of some of the<br>points of interest to research topics<br>that we spend time on that we think are<br>important and again we see generation of<br>questions around this as we go forward<br>the other piece that we do is we spend a<br>considerable amount of time working the<br>outreach piece and I have a colleague<br>the other co-director Mike Arthur and he<br>does a lot more of the research a little<br>bit of the outreach I do a lot of the<br>outreach does a little bit of I do a<br>little bit of the research as well so we<br>see some value in sourcing that we have<br>a team of people again that are working<br>this but the outreach piece is a place<br>that we spend a lot of time and a point<br>that I'll make here tonight several<br>times as we think about that that social<br>license or that engagement with the many<br>communities that we deal with so again<br>you'll see me in bed that in a number of<br>the points that I make the engagement<br>that I talked about that this the<br>stakeholder engagement a short list of<br>some of the folks that we work with some<br>that I've mentioned already but as was<br>mentioned in the beginning we see some<br>of these poles we see some of the<br>dialogue that's occurring in the<br>community we've seen this over the<br>course of several years now as the first<br>shale while in Pennsylvania for shell<br>while and Texas was back in the 90s so<br>maybe again going back to the comments<br>that were made in the introduction Texas<br>is Texas I mean they've been developing<br>oil and gas down there for a long long<br>time decades and decades worth of time<br>so the mindset there is certainly go<br>forth and drill more holes and produce<br>resource and sell the resource<br>Pennsylvania by chance is in the states<br>is considered where oil and gas started<br>first well was fueled back in the 1850s<br>1859 i believe so it's been at it for a<br>long time we have a lot of wells but not<br>a lot of production so there's shallow<br>wells very little yield but a lot of<br>holes in the ground and that's generated<br>a number of issues and communities are<br>concerned about that express those<br>concerns and the work that we do and<br>again one of the one of the reasons and<br>one of the drivers for us in the work<br>that we do to try to provide science<br>based research science based education<br>of them so we do a couple hundred<br>outreach sessions in the course of a<br>year we think that's a very important<br>part of the dialogue we also as I was<br>pointing out to a group earlier we try<br>to teach specific<br>things as we're working with crowds of<br>people that we're dealing with either in<br>face-to-face sessions like this or in<br>some of the distance type learning<br>webinars and polycom conferences and a<br>variety different ways that we that we<br>converse with our publics out there one<br>of the things we talked about again as I<br>referenced to the group before was<br>dealing about risk and managing risk and<br>as I indicated several times here we<br>think risk is a big part of this<br>conversation and something that that we<br>think we need to keep embedding as we go<br>and I used this particular conversation<br>this particular picture for for a<br>specific reason if you look very closely<br>the the gentleman that's carrying the<br>site has a perception that there's risk<br>attached to the activity thinking about<br>hydraulic fracturing or fracking is it<br>typically referred to as people kind of<br>sum up the entire process so here's a<br>perception about that but if you look<br>very closely and a perception of risk<br>involved in that obviously thinking is<br>riskier II wouldn't be carrying the sign<br>or you would assume but if you look at<br>the gentleman very closely to see<br>smoking a cigarette so you know his<br>perception of one risk compared to the<br>perception of another risk you know you<br>can work through the dynamics of what<br>that actually means the point is we try<br>to teach about the science and we try to<br>teach about how you think through that<br>process in particular we also think<br>about as we're working through this<br>we're trying to broaden people's<br>appreciation for energy and energy<br>development where energy is source from<br>what it looks like every time and what<br>the impacts will be in a variety<br>different ways again you can look at the<br>pictures that are here and maybe see<br>some of the ironies that are there so<br>this is an upstate New York where there<br>is essentially no shale gas development<br>going on and there's a lot of impact or<br>conversation about impacts to their<br>infrastructure in a variety different<br>ways there's concerns there this is in<br>an area where there's a lot of wineries<br>there's a lot of agritourism it's an<br>area where there's a lot of lakes where<br>this particular picture was shot you're<br>trying to put in an lpg facility but on<br>yet so this gentleman obviously is<br>opposed to it but you can see on the<br>other hand he uses a lot of energy lpg<br>the same that he's opposed to the<br>storage he's also in favor of that<br>utilization piece so it's a matter of<br>trying to connect people to the energy<br>and the sourcing of energy that they're<br>using over the course of time that's<br>part of our mission and then more<br>broadly what is the impact so if you<br>don't do this and you want to use this<br>meaning making selection of energy types<br>what will that mean what will the<br>impacts be to the landscape while the<br>impacts be to communities only impacts<br>be two industries that are already in<br>place so we find quite often that people<br>including in this area or opposed to<br>natural gas they're interested in wind<br>turbine or wind power but they're not<br>interested in and there's a lot of<br>ordinances that are in opposition it<br>would not allow the siting of that same<br>wind power that they're in favor of that<br>habit generation so as we often say<br>they're in favor of wind generation as<br>long as it's in Kansas and you send it<br>in a wire and you understand that<br>dynamics of that but that is the reality<br>as we see it unfortunately so we're in<br>favor of science around all types of<br>energy development and as a nation our<br>policy is all the above whatever<br>whatever that might mean in different<br>contexts and certainly in different<br>opinions so the siting of sore out in<br>some of the drier areas some of the<br>areas that have been pre-designated for<br>the development of that same type of<br>energy development so we see people that<br>are interested but again maybe looking<br>at it not necessarily in their backyard<br>but in some of their other part of the<br>world that case maybe out in the desert<br>but what would the implications of that<br>be of any type so again as we go back<br>and we think well if you looked at<br>Pennsylvania and I think the<br>Pennsylvania scenarios may be an<br>indicator or something on a national<br>level and quite frankly a global<br>scenario these two pictures are shot to<br>different parts of the world but the<br>situation applies this these are<br>finished wells I think there's like five<br>of them they're finished wells from<br>conventional type development on one pad<br>draining several square miles of area<br>coming all that gas collected back<br>through horizontal wells and collected<br>on that pad versus the type of energy<br>development one of the other contrasting<br>types of energy development thinking<br>about solar and cited on another errand<br>this is actually down in the Crimea<br>down in Ukraine one of the larger solar<br>facilities out there if you're familiar<br>in our case I should just give you a one<br>more indicator so our number one<br>industry in Pennsylvania which it is in<br>a lot of different places is agriculture<br>so we're concerned about agricultural<br>impacts of Energy Development whatever<br>type of energy development is our number<br>two industry is tourism and they're<br>really they're neck and neck they bounce<br>back and forth so something that looks<br>industrial is not likely to be something<br>that's going to attract a lot of tourism<br>type dollars so what this looks like<br>over the course of time is of great<br>interest to us so we think about the<br>implications of of this compared to this<br>if you're familiar with the Crimea you<br>would know that some of that ground is<br>some of the best topsoil in the entire<br>world is in that region of Ukraine so<br>what are the implications of that and we<br>see that even within our state some<br>solar sighting of solar near one of our<br>better agricultural areas and the impact<br>and the pushback from the community that<br>we need to protect our resource in that<br>case our agricultural resource so this<br>is a very convoluted very polarized<br>conversation and we see it played out in<br>a variety of different ways so let's<br>move on from there we talk about some of<br>the other considerations that are<br>attached to this as we're thinking about<br>risk often break that down and what's a<br>possible risk and what's a probable risk<br>because in this conversation people talk<br>about well it could pollute thinking<br>about the fossil energy it could pollute<br>the groundwater or it could do it could<br>have a certain air emission component to<br>it or it could have well integrity<br>issues wells might leak variety of<br>different things can be pointed out and<br>we've seen issues that all those turn<br>out to be true the scenario is well how<br>often does it happen how high is that<br>risk and can that risk be managed can<br>you have good regulation can you change<br>processes can you read amp the<br>engineering or all the above you come up<br>with something that's going to reduce<br>that risk and reduce the the probability<br>of that occurring now often will say<br>it's possible this roof might fall down<br>but we're in here we feel safe because<br>we don't think that it's very probable<br>the same thing would apply in this case<br>so there's a lot of things that again<br>are possible that may not be<br>necessarily probable so you weigh that<br>against the value of the the the<br>resource being developed and that and<br>the benefits that are seen we've seen<br>some environmental benefits we've seen<br>green space that's being maintained for<br>instance we see more pad development but<br>we see less farms that are now being<br>converted as people and farmers retire<br>it might have sold land for development<br>because they could use the cash stream<br>and moved off the farm and move the farm<br>away from from agriculture we see some<br>of that now those trends starting to<br>slow anyway in some cases reverse we<br>also see obviously the economic piece<br>job development we see resources in<br>terms of dollars capital is being spent<br>within communities we see this talked<br>about a bridge to someplace else so this<br>displacing coal utilization for instance<br>is one of the big trends that we see but<br>other types of energy as well and we're<br>now even starting to see it this place<br>nuclear some of the smaller older<br>nuclear plants that are coming off line<br>and some other ones that aren't so small<br>and aren't so old that are now the<br>economics of running them compared to<br>gas becoming less favorable and some of<br>the utility operators saying well<br>they're going to they're going to<br>decommission those plants and move away<br>from them now I don't know that we're<br>going to see that wholesale in the<br>States but we do see some early sign of<br>that trend into some that's a worrisome<br>trend may be here in New Zealand that<br>would not be but stateside that's<br>considered to some degree at a worrisome<br>trend but a variety of things we also<br>see that the geopolitical we think about<br>energy security and not just thinking<br>about that certainly not thinking about<br>that just from Pennsylvania perspective<br>but seeing that as a global peace so<br>countries that were struggling maybe<br>balance of payments now might have a new<br>opportunity with different types of<br>energy development going forward we also<br>watch this trend about this this broader<br>move we think about this on a global<br>standpoint and this Golden Age of gas<br>and the and the many conversations are<br>wrapped around that as we see a variety<br>of countries that are moving in that<br>direction we'll show a map and there are<br>certainly some early movers in that<br>regard some that are that made some<br>early moves and are moving forward<br>seemingly with some speed<br>some other ones that have made some<br>steps that way or struggling trying to<br>figure out the geology or trying to get<br>their regulatory or their there are tax<br>schemes in order before they move any<br>any faster or certainly it's become<br>hindrance in some locations but<br>certainly some early movers that way we<br>see some of that in Europe and we watch<br>the UK and particular so at the highest<br>levels of government you have you have<br>spokesman so to speak that or that are<br>stepping forward and saying as a nation<br>we're going to develop this resource<br>we're going to go forward we're going to<br>drill holes we're going to tap the<br>resource we're going to see the economic<br>benefits as they frame the story and<br>we're going to move the story forward so<br>UK would be an example that Poland would<br>be another you could start to look at<br>something like France and say well you<br>know not so much not not sure it's the<br>right move politically not sure it's the<br>right move from an environmental<br>standpoint some social implications of<br>that tourism again we think about France<br>tourism is a big industry agriculture as<br>well so they're not so construe as to<br>how the impacts of something like<br>unconventional or shale would play out<br>in that type of environment so we see a<br>slowing we also see other ones that are<br>that are attempting and making some of<br>the moves and as we watch the country<br>ukraine for instance that's struggling<br>politically right now a lot of the<br>dynamics and we were having some<br>discussion even before we came down here<br>tonight a lot of those dynamics are<br>being played out because of energy and<br>the payment for energy to as they often<br>refer to the big brother to the to the<br>east of them and as we play that out<br>specifically we see those Eastern<br>European countries that in the past in<br>the submarine al beholden to where their<br>gas is coming from and the pricing<br>that's attached to that we see the<br>implications of that i mentioned Ukraine<br>but you could you could start up in the<br>Baltics and run all the way down to<br>Bulgaria and all those countries are as<br>well as countries to the west of them<br>are looking at sourcing their energy<br>from again that the big brother to the<br>east and what that might mean in terms<br>of an energy security is the energy<br>going to come through is it going to be<br>able to transit through Ukraine we've<br>seen some<br>several different times where that's<br>been problematic and what will that mean<br>in the long term we're now starting to<br>see you see Russia with guys from look<br>to the eastern markets and thinking<br>about supplying into Asia for instance<br>that change is a dynamic it opened up<br>opens up potentially a market for some<br>other countries to supply Europe it also<br>changes the geopolitical ramp<br>considerations are wrapped around that<br>the ramifications that would that would<br>be a piece going forward as we think<br>about what this might be when you look<br>at the u.s. you think about where gas is<br>being sourced we see some changes over<br>time I think that graphic displays in<br>and walks through they're pretty pretty<br>easily you see how much was coming from<br>shale initially obviously like I<br>indicated before you get back to the 90s<br>would prior to that you wouldn't seen<br>any it would have been essentially zero<br>and we've seen a big ramp that's<br>occurred since then and there's an<br>expected ramp as as we march forward<br>thinking again about this in the u.s.<br>perspective but I think you would see a<br>very similar type picture even if you<br>looked at the Canadian experience in a<br>number of different ways not always but<br>number of different ways and the<br>expected counting for shale gas being<br>about fifty percent of the marketplace<br>when you run out to the end of the<br>timeline but number of private forecasts<br>are looking at that could be closer to<br>seventy percent and when you look at the<br>quick ramp up which I'll show you it<br>when you look at some of the individual<br>states and we'll use Pennsylvania's as a<br>benchmark there we're seeing that that<br>could be attainable when you think about<br>that so where is the shale being<br>developed back to the US experience<br>we're trying to work this down from a<br>global down to a u.s. than down to a<br>more localized type of level help you<br>baby to put that into context or how<br>some of the conversations might be<br>playing out here and where there might<br>be some value in that regard but we see<br>where most of development is occurring<br>is is with the Marcellus anyway and the<br>utica shale is up here in the Northeast<br>eastern part proximity is a big driver<br>so again if we're looking at economics<br>you've got a lot of capacity in place in<br>terms of transmission in terms of<br>pipeline impression rise storage up in<br>that part of the<br>world as well but you also now have a<br>huge resource that's in close proximity<br>and you've got a big part of your market<br>your high-end part of your market<br>traditionally historically it's been up<br>in the northeast part of the of the US<br>now that dynamic has changed<br>dramatically because of the abundance<br>and the development that has occurred<br>now that's really starting to change<br>that picture also remember as I show<br>another slide here's the Haynesville<br>down here deeper wells not so close to<br>market higher costs to produce that same<br>gas and the Eagle fur down here closer<br>more liquids this is more gas some of<br>both but this is more liquids and some<br>oil a lot of that going into the the<br>processing and the petrochemical complex<br>that would be down in the in the Gulf<br>area so again there's some dynamics in<br>terms of location and where these<br>resources are actually located one of<br>the things that we're seeing is the ramp<br>up again as I referenced at that last<br>map and remember several the points<br>there we talked about the marsalis we<br>talked about this boost going forward we<br>talked about the Eagle fern and some of<br>the natural gas liquids in the oil that<br>has an opportunity to go to market place<br>in close proximity we look at the<br>Haynesville that maybe doesn't have that<br>same market outlet with LNG shipments<br>over the course of time assuming<br>permitting more permitting goes that way<br>that trend will likely turn around but<br>right now we see these patterns that are<br>very different than maybe what we would<br>have thought even a couple years ago we<br>also as we start to work this out if you<br>follow any of the shale development and<br>some of the different plays there's a<br>number of larger ones out there there's<br>some smaller ones as well we don't<br>mention the sum of the Niobrara and a<br>couple other ones in there that would be<br>fields of interest but you can see some<br>of the big ones and some of the quantity<br>that's coming out and if you look at the<br>marsalis there's a little bit of West<br>Virginia data that's corporated in there<br>you can see that it's turned out to be a<br>very big deal compared to again just a<br>couple years ago when there was no<br>development that was occurring in that<br>in that regard<br>and how much of even the u.s. gas is<br>being produced when you think about<br>shale gas coming from there the other<br>thing to keep in mind is we think about<br>those kind of numbers and some of the<br>trends will show is in Pennsylvania<br>about 7,300 wells will show a map but<br>about a third of the wells are not even<br>hooked in yet so they've been drilled<br>they may have been hydraulically<br>fractured or not going through a well<br>stimulation their process or not and<br>again they might not be online because<br>of lack of gathering capacity gathering<br>pipeline or transmission line to bring<br>that same gas to market so the market is<br>expecting that and the pricing we're<br>seeing the lower pricing of gas in the<br>States is partly dictated on a national<br>basis by the fact that we have a lot of<br>capacity there some places it's<br>constrained for movement other places a<br>lot of capacities being built we're<br>looking at about a hundred million<br>dollars about a 10 billion dollar build<br>pipeline build per year for ten years<br>that's what the expectation is by<br>industry estimates at this point in time<br>so a lot of capital still needs to be<br>spent a lot of pipe needs to be put in<br>the ground again a lot of when you think<br>downstream a lot of the implications of<br>that social implications is this reaches<br>into more communities environmental when<br>you think about more pipe more right<br>away more clearances more timber and you<br>know you get to start playing it out in<br>a lot of different ways a lot of<br>implications there this map will kind of<br>build and give some kind of an idea if<br>you're not familiar with where<br>everything is located you get New York<br>City up here Philadelphia down here<br>washington DC down here this is state of<br>Pennsylvania West Virginia and Ohio this<br>is New York you can see where there's no<br>development occurring up in New York<br>because their regulatory process is not<br>in motion they've been working through<br>redeveloping the regulations for about<br>the last five years now so a lot of<br>public comment periods a lot of<br>revisions a lot of other political<br>ramifications in that location so at<br>this point in time no movement forward<br>in terms of development their resource<br>marsalis and you<br>l both extend up into that area you see<br>a very similar situation here in the<br>western part of maryland whereas again<br>West Virginia Ohio and Pennsylvania the<br>politics and those three locations or<br>though surrey state said go forth and<br>produce the resource and we'll keep<br>evolving and updating and changing the<br>regulations as a development is taking<br>place so working from the benchmark of<br>what regulations were there for the<br>industry that was already in place in<br>modifying them again in parallel as the<br>development is occurring versus those<br>other two locations where not so much<br>there are some questions before the<br>group about well okay so if those wells<br>are being produced is this a process<br>where you have to keep quickly drilling<br>more wells because the wells that have<br>been drilled these shale wells are<br>declining rapidly and the reality is you<br>get about half the production and the<br>decline curves here indicate that you<br>get about half of the production in<br>about the first two and a half two to<br>two-and-a-half to three years depending<br>upon where it is in the marsalis or the<br>Utica that's what we're seeing okay<br>we're also seeing the productivity of<br>these wells over their lifetime is<br>actually turning out to be much higher<br>than most companies thought mid<br>single-digits the five to six billion<br>cubic feet again this is lifetime<br>production which lifetime of these wells<br>the expected life is twenty to fifty<br>years so it's a pretty long period of<br>time most of it like indicated coming in<br>in the beginning and this these are<br>roughly similar to declines that we're<br>seeing in shale wells across the nation<br>and crop including across Western Canada<br>as well so it's pretty similar and then<br>the other half of that production coming<br>in the latter part or the remaining<br>several decades of life as well that's<br>it starts to run run relatively flat but<br>if we looked at the marsalis we see this<br>slow belt and again this is a story that<br>we have different Shale wells different<br>different geology in different parts of<br>the world is not all the same so our<br>experience our politics our private<br>ownership and minerals a number of rigs<br>that we have operating or available to<br>develop this is different in<br>the state's as it might be different in<br>eastern or western europe or it might be<br>in africa parts of Africa or Asia or<br>potentially in this corner of the world<br>as well we have a similar conversation<br>like that in Australia last week so it<br>makes a difference we recognize that but<br>these are the numbers and the trends and<br>some of the changes that we've seen<br>based on all those factors coming<br>together and some would call a perfect<br>storm some would call a perfect disaster<br>those that obviously the twenty percent<br>that your reference that aren't so in<br>favor of this would see all those things<br>being problematic we also recognize and<br>in Pennsylvania we moved we were largely<br>an import state for a long time and now<br>we've moved to an export state and if<br>you look at the new numbers which just<br>came out this week we're now at three<br>point three trillion cubic feet that had<br>been produced from the state so a lot of<br>gas is being produced it was not being<br>produced before because the technology<br>to produce that gas was was not<br>necessarily known or being utilized and<br>we're seeing this consumption line here<br>really being influenced this is a gas<br>consumption line within state this is<br>being largely influenced by the<br>relationship between price of gas and<br>the price of coal because we have a lot<br>of coal that's used for power generation<br>so that interplay or relationship then<br>between different types of fossil energy<br>and the historical patterns of the past<br>or recent past including right up to<br>moment and a new emerging dynamic that's<br>there with with shale gas coming in we<br>also as we start to expand this back out<br>a little bit we can talk about some of<br>the issues that we have in terms of the<br>job build so you think about the broader<br>economic considerations or attached<br>number of jobs are there there's a lot<br>of controversy as to how many jobs<br>depends use assessment you use we've<br>done it done the one as well and ours is<br>is more midstream than maybe the other<br>extremes that are out there we see<br>revenue generation is going back to the<br>state in our case we do not have a<br>severance tax but we have an impact fee<br>so monies that are paid on a per well<br>basis back to the state redistributed<br>back out to communities and pay for a<br>variety of different things<br>environmental considerations if the<br>structure builds road repairs and a<br>variety of things there's 13 categories<br>that those dollars can be spent on and<br>number is about to jump the 600 million<br>when the next payment is made here<br>shortly and then lastly dollars that are<br>recirculating within communities so I<br>mentioned we have private ownership and<br>minerals so those royalty dollars that<br>are there are royalties are paid to<br>landowners that that that well might<br>have been situated on or participating<br>in that drilling unit there's dollars<br>then flowing back to those landowners<br>there's dollars being reinvested or<br>recycled will say back within many of<br>those communities and will show that but<br>in our case again as we start to expand<br>this back out we see a lot of gas is<br>being developed we see a lot of<br>infrastructure that's being built<br>roughly half of the transmission or half<br>of the pipe infrastructure a bill that's<br>going on in the states right now<br>nationwide is somehow related to<br>development that's that's dealing with<br>marsala so the merciless is really a big<br>pretty big part of the story the story<br>is not just about Pennsylvania in that<br>case but it's a matter of what is the<br>size of this resource and what is it<br>doing to the historical patterns of how<br>gas moves of energy is being sourced and<br>what the ramifications of that are<br>measured by Everett whatever metric you<br>that you'd like to use from economic all<br>the way through environment and<br>considering a variety of other things in<br>between but we know as we think about<br>that let me back up as we think about<br>that we also know that it we find the<br>dark constraints in the system will talk<br>about one of those in just in just a<br>moment those constraints would be for<br>individual users like Powergen which is<br>the point that i'll make or it might be<br>in other ways that some of the product<br>that's being developed as we think in<br>this case not just dry gas that's being<br>developed but also wet gas meaning it<br>has other hydrocarbons in it the other<br>hydrocarbons or natural gas liquids that<br>have another market think propane and<br>ethane and butane and other<br>considerations there other carbons that<br>are in there that are then utilized for<br>other industrial processes or we utilize<br>some place in our lives thinking about<br>propane for instance so we have to build<br>infrastructure to be able to deliver<br>some of those products to market and<br>again there's ramifications to that we<br>think about this in in a variety of her<br>ways some of the constraints so if the<br>price of gas was kind of cruising along<br>pretty<br>pretty level because of the influence<br>that I mentioned you've got a lot of<br>supply chasing a certain demand from the<br>market and all sudden it gets very very<br>very cold and the constraints start to<br>show up but the pipe is not made to<br>carry as much gas as the market is<br>calling for you get these spikes we<br>clearly see net and now we see more<br>political will and it you can see what<br>it spiked to US dollars this is actually<br>not the Eastern the up into the New<br>England marketplace look at Boston price<br>in that area paid by power generators<br>actually crested at a hundred dollars a<br>unit keep in mind these for just a short<br>period of time measured in days but keep<br>in mind that that same unit of gas was<br>selling for several dollars a unit three<br>$54 unit somewhere in that range just<br>prior to that so a cold spell can can<br>illustrate some of these issues so<br>constraints in the market constraints in<br>the politics that will allow more pipe<br>to go in the ground to utilize the<br>resource is something that we see as<br>well and again something that we enter<br>into in the conversation I would sum up<br>this graph by saying more out less in so<br>we're looking at we look at this on a<br>North American standpoint thinking about<br>Mexico and thinking about Canada as well<br>we see will be likely exporting more gas<br>we're already doing that sending gas<br>that we had not been sending nearly this<br>amount into Mexico or into Canada<br>especially in the eastern Canada we have<br>been buying gas from Eastern Canada that<br>was coming transiting across from<br>Western Canada now we're sending gas the<br>other way so reversing capacity to do<br>that expectation is that that will be<br>coming from marsalis or is coming from<br>ourselves will be for quite some time<br>and it's really more than a story about<br>marsalis there's other shales and again<br>the interconnect between these different<br>pipelines bringing you from other shells<br>or that are even below it blow us we<br>think about pennsylvania and less coming<br>in to our coast and maybe just another<br>illustration we think about mexico<br>scenario you can see the rapid bumper<br>increase in this and if you look at the<br>graph to canada you would see a very<br>similar type scenario this is the point<br>that we want to illustrate here so this<br>is the price of crude on a per barrel<br>basis<br>is the price of a unit of natural gas we<br>see this divergence we see this<br>separation between the pricing between<br>those two and the story as we think<br>about this is not just well that's<br>interesting graph time what does that<br>really mean to us what the story is<br>really talking about is talking about<br>well what's that trend likely to do and<br>what kind of decisions are being made<br>around that so we're seeing and I'll<br>illustrate that with some numbers here<br>we're seeing manufacturing patterns<br>change potentially we're seeing some of<br>the politics or that change around that<br>we're seeing new industries that are<br>sprouting up because of this type of<br>separation and we're the expectation of<br>where a unit of gas will be priced over<br>the course of time so as we start to go<br>down that road and segue in that<br>direction we see other units of energy<br>the price of them are the trend lines of<br>them and although some of the movements<br>might be small and time we can still see<br>that there's a relatively large drop we<br>think about the price of natural gas<br>thinking about that from a feedstock or<br>energy source and one of those trend<br>lines so if you back up to the graph<br>before you recognized that a lot of<br>companies are making decisions on where<br>they see that spray going or were those<br>trends seem to be going over time you<br>can look three years out in the futures<br>market and you can see that that that is<br>playing out in that same direction so as<br>we think that out our story has started<br>to switch from this part about a<br>development of gas to as were multiple<br>years into this now to the utilization<br>of gas so where is the gas going to go<br>who's going to use it what's it going to<br>be used for what value is going to be<br>added to it versus a commodity either to<br>go offshore which some of that is<br>definitely going to occur from from what<br>all indications are what permits of an<br>issue but again looking at some other<br>industries that are looking to utilize<br>this and looking even as this reshoring<br>is occurring looking at some of the<br>differences that other countries are<br>saying we need to develop our resource<br>and that's one of the conversations you<br>clearly hear when you're in Germany you<br>clearly hear it at the highest political<br>levels and certainly at the industry<br>levels when you go to you<br>we're going to lose some of our heavy<br>manufacturing or intensive energy<br>intensive industry to other parts of the<br>world in particular seeing it go to the<br>states and they're not interested in<br>doing that just like you wouldn't be<br>interested so trying to preserve<br>industry and having a resource develop a<br>resource if they see it and that's<br>largely the conversation that's taking<br>place so high energy costs whether it's<br>gas whether it's electric and some of<br>those locations and it does seem to be<br>driving this reshoring of industry<br>coming back stateside or looking at new<br>industry coming in and crank through<br>some other numbers as well again when<br>you think about some of the industries<br>are expanding their footprint or some<br>that are coming in and ones to some<br>degree that might not have been there<br>our president and his most recent state<br>of the union address was talking about<br>this 100 billion dollar number in terms<br>of announced projects in the next three<br>years so capital expenditures to develop<br>industries that will be utilizing this<br>that are directly reporting that's due<br>to the price of natural gas or the shale<br>energy is as it's moving forward to<br>highlight a couple of these quickly we<br>can see the power trend out there or the<br>power gen trend i should say the amount<br>of looking at where this is going and we<br>can look at an example and there's many<br>examples like this across the nation<br>pennsylvania was the easiest one for us<br>to pull out or maybe we thought it was<br>most illustrated the situation the best<br>and see there's nine plants you can see<br>the amount of megawatts that are being<br>generated by that it's very substantial<br>and these are located in close proximity<br>to where the resources developed so<br>again we're looking at a lot of<br>infrastructure build we're seeing Cole<br>come offline there's that question<br>what's driving it is the market force<br>driving it or as regulation driving it<br>at the federal level in that case and<br>we're seeing likely some of both so the<br>war on coal that were having or those<br>often talked about in the States and<br>certainly in Washington driving part of<br>that and then the market market forces<br>just like I mentioned about the nuclear<br>that's driving market forces that are<br>driving that look at environmental<br>considerations we look at some of the<br>conversions are taking place record<br>number of homes especially the<br>northeastern part of the US or a lot<br>Iran fuel oil<br>we see a number of those who are<br>converting over to electric because of<br>the lower cost of electric or the lower<br>price of gas and what we're hearing our<br>president was saying that the savings on<br>a per family basis with the lowering of<br>the price of gas if you factor that all<br>the way through the process and think<br>about all the ramifications and Industry<br>and power and other other considerations<br>there it's about a twelve hundred dollar<br>stipend on a per family basis so it's<br>playing out with a lot of different to<br>people in a lot of different ways and<br>even the change or the shift from<br>onshore or offshore to onshore another<br>big change we're seeing is this move in<br>the infrastructure so again on a<br>national basis and again at our highest<br>political the federal level but played<br>out from the federal level we down the<br>local level then certainly the private<br>sector as well finding an opportunity<br>from the utilizing natural gas into<br>Friday different ways for transportation<br>now it would appear that heavy industry<br>going to move that way a little quicker<br>we even see and we were talking about<br>earlier marine applications you think<br>about locomotives sort of running now<br>and some new interests from some of the<br>companies are building them to move to<br>LNG light industry or light<br>transportation i should say light<br>vehicles maybe not so much manufacturers<br>seem to be a little slow to that our<br>conversations with them not moving so<br>rapidly that way and then that the big<br>question who builds the infrastructure<br>you build the infrastructure and drive<br>the transportation conversion or you<br>start to convert the the transportation<br>and the infrastructure follow so the<br>chicken or the egg scenario played out<br>so you see a lot of different things in<br>that regard you see more rd for engine<br>technologies it certainly a place for as<br>we think about academia we think about<br>engineering we think about a number of<br>other considerations there we think<br>about material sciences and the changes<br>that will need in those in those regards<br>going forward but we also see that<br>entrepreneurial piece and this idea<br>about more investment in GTL so can you<br>utilize the infrastructure you have in<br>place can you make a can you take<br>natural gas and convert it which you<br>obviously can but can you convert it in<br>a<br>a way that is economically feasible into<br>a liquid fuel and into a liquid fuel<br>that you can dispense through<br>infrastructure that you already have in<br>place so that's then become a big part<br>of the conversation and we see that not<br>scale to the billion-dollar level but<br>scale to the tens of millions or<br>hundreds of millions of dollars in terms<br>of the scale of those type of GTL<br>processes and also those that we use<br>catalysts that can they can toggle back<br>and forth between biomass or natural gas<br>depending upon what the opportunity<br>might be so again seems like there's<br>investment opportunities and we<br>certainly see lots of research going<br>into that lots of R&amp;D L&amp;G which we'll<br>talk about number of projects have been<br>approved I think the question is well<br>how much will be in that regard going<br>forward again as we start to then bring<br>this back down so that's up at the<br>National what does it mean within<br>individual communities so a couple quick<br>slides may need to make some<br>illustrations in that regard I mentioned<br>about the 700 plus million dollars of<br>recycled royalties and lease payments to<br>landowners but we also see companies<br>that are now investing as you're<br>drilling those 70 300 odd wells in<br>Pennsylvania spending a lot of money<br>billions of dollars in Pennsylvania is<br>making an impact in terms of new<br>businesses is making impact certainly in<br>terms of workforce and such so there's<br>lots of statistics out there so there's<br>some pros and cons of this process again<br>it's a very polarized type of a<br>conversation but the economic piece<br>seems to be relatively straightforward<br>and you can you can clearly see some of<br>these gains over time and then new<br>industries are coming in here in<br>southwestern Pennsylvania as well as in<br>some of the surrounding states in that<br>corner of the world a kind of a regional<br>area looking at processing looking at<br>petrochemicals looking at intensive<br>energy like manufacturing thinking about<br>steel industry that had largely moved<br>away and now is moving back so again a<br>number of those announced projects other<br>types of chemicals rubber manufacturing<br>and things of that nature but things are<br>coming back into an area that had not<br>seen them ever or had not seen them to<br>the same time scale also broke this down<br>into three individual counties these are<br>up in the northern<br>here at pennsylvania or central part<br>where a lot of developments going on and<br>essentially 75% of the gas coming out of<br>pennsylvania right now is coming out of<br>six counties for in the north-central<br>northeastern park closer like new york<br>city and 22 the southwestern corner<br>which is where a lot of those ngl czar<br>the wet gas is and down near the<br>pittsburgh area if you go to that north<br>central where a lot of that volume is<br>coming from and look well what impact<br>has it had so we've measured things like<br>impacts to real estate values impacts<br>agriculture impacts airports measure<br>things like revenue generation so think<br>about new people coming in paying taxes<br>when they stay at a hotel where those<br>taxes are going in the impact then to<br>that that those specific locations these<br>dollars uniquely go towards tourist<br>promotion afterwards so the more dollars<br>more promotion the more you keep an<br>industry that was there in place before<br>this occurred in tact and that ramp has<br>largely occurred that's all occurred<br>inside of the shale development rail<br>traffic again some of those maybe off<br>the off the grid type conversations but<br>a place that we see impacts out there<br>and some very large ramifications you<br>look at lycoming number of rail cars<br>prior to the shale at work that we're<br>dealing with some of the same<br>considerations like stone coming in or<br>sand the proppant or pipe variety of<br>other things and you can see how big<br>those bumps are and you can see the<br>implications over time we also look at<br>things like sales tax collections so<br>again what are some of the barometers<br>that we use to gauge how big of an<br>impact this is in the many communities<br>or collectively into the state of<br>Pennsylvania this might be we see this<br>play out in a variety of state so this<br>isn't unique unique to Pennsylvania Ohio<br>has some really good numbers out to the<br>state to the west of us that would show<br>a lot of very very similar type of<br>trends out there and keep in mind this<br>is in a timeframe if you if you look at<br>the numbers up here are the dates up<br>here this isn't a time frame that our<br>economy has been struggling as a nation<br>but certainly struggling as a state so<br>we're seeing again some indications of<br>what this type of development looks like<br>I want to be very careful and say that<br>this is not plugging for an industry<br>it's indicating some of the trends that<br>we're seeing out there and I think it's<br>very important to recognize the<br>statistics and how their play<br>in that regard you also look at some of<br>the other considerations we think about<br>some of the environmental components we<br>think about training the workforce the<br>future we think about training those<br>regulators as I mentioned before so<br>working and training that group as they<br>come forward and also seeing that a lot<br>of those are transitioning over time as<br>they're trained often what we do is we<br>see them move to industry or move to<br>some other sector so you see that that<br>revolving door and it's important to<br>make sure that we're putting trained<br>people back in so if there is going to<br>be the social license out there in time<br>and public trust in that that there is a<br>training process to make sure that they<br>understand the latest techniques latest<br>technology or the geology and the<br>general understanding of what it is that<br>they're responsible for either in<br>permitting or inspection we think about<br>the regulatory considerations there and<br>a variety of other things what are the<br>true risks as I mentioned before in the<br>beginning trying to work through that<br>making sure we're documenting baseline<br>data one of the things we found in the<br>beginning of our process is most people<br>had not tested your public water or<br>their private water wells we had one<br>point two wells and pence private wells<br>in Pennsylvania most people had never<br>tested her water as hard as that is to<br>believe never tested their water so what<br>we found was forty percent of those<br>wells forty percent had some court of<br>eight a health-based parameter that had<br>been a federal parameter had been<br>breached forty percent of the wells we<br>also found the twenty-five percent of<br>them through this testing process had<br>detectable methane into water already so<br>before there was any drilling they<br>already had methane in their water so<br>you can see some of the ramifications of<br>that is that plays out from a legal<br>standpoint or people's appreciation or<br>understanding and they're trying to<br>understand this industry is it's moving<br>into their backyard it's the same place<br>or sourcing that water what do they have<br>the start with what are the baseline and<br>what kind of changes are there to be<br>monitored over time so important<br>considerations we also think about where<br>the gaps research gaps again come from<br>an academic standpoint what can we learn<br>from from where we are right now what<br>are we missing in that story what are<br>some of the issues that are raised what<br>do we still need to determine and the<br>last one I want to mention on there is<br>maybe an example<br>of some efforts coming together you have<br>the NGO community NGO community you have<br>some foundation support you have<br>government you have academia and you<br>have the industry all coming together in<br>that regard and putting together an<br>organization that will do provide look<br>at best management practices so<br>environmental best managed practices<br>good drilling practices and then do<br>environmental audits so the best<br>companies then we'll go through that<br>audit process and a very transparent<br>kind of a way and then float to the<br>public or float to the to the surface<br>where some other ones that either would<br>refuse to go through that process<br>although it's a voluntary process is a<br>voluntary process or go through and not<br>come out with necessarily the best of<br>audit again in a republic kind of way<br>then that would be known to to the<br>pressure the public pressure and the<br>regulatory pressure to change some of<br>the ways there so some good things that<br>have come from that type of grouping<br>together and lastly some of the<br>regulatory issues that we would see<br>thinking about some of the things that<br>we've discovered the date certainly<br>water we think about the quantity issue<br>but certainly quality issues a quantity<br>is not so much our problem we think<br>about Pennsylvania but when you go to<br>Texas that would be a major problem or<br>down in the arid Southwest we do some<br>work in parts of South America we do<br>some works in it's a work in parts of<br>Africa some dialogue in Australia as<br>well certainly some very arid parts of<br>the world so where would the quantity of<br>water that they would need what kind of<br>quality issues could be impacted or what<br>water quality issues could be impacted<br>over the course of time and a variety of<br>other things dealing with water all the<br>way down through thinking about the<br>waste and dealing with waste and<br>recycling some of the processes that<br>we've changed over time through good<br>regulation I think good regulation is<br>the fact that we've moved from surface<br>discharge of fluids in this case waters<br>to now recycling almost all the water<br>that's being used and what's not<br>recycled then going into disposal wells<br>and we have about ten percent of the of<br>the waste stream going in disposal wells<br>the levels of brine or salinity get so<br>high that has to be has to go in<br>other different process but we also look<br>at issues of norm a lot of questions<br>about norm out there so we think about<br>you know this black shale can yield<br>low-level radioactive waste is a waste<br>manageable waste does it have to be<br>disposed of in a certain way does it<br>build up in pipe does it build up in<br>other parts of the infrastructure and<br>some of the gaps again the research gaps<br>that need to be understood better about<br>that and also thinking about do<br>seismicity and it may be an issue that<br>would be of interest here in particular<br>but I think any place around the world<br>you talk about the potential for<br>inducing an earthquake people listen and<br>we're seeing in a number of locations<br>within the US where you have underground<br>disposal wells of the not enough is<br>known about the geology of microseismic<br>has not been done regulations are not<br>robust enough and you induce seismicity<br>and do small earthquakes some of these<br>are they're all measurable but some of<br>these are can be found at surface and<br>most of them cannot but still inducing<br>seismicity is not considered be a good<br>thing so looking at earthquakes that<br>from disposal wells that you have high<br>pressure high volumes for long periods<br>of time versus the hydraulic fracturing<br>that's not causing there's small<br>earthquakes because you have all the<br>same elements but you have much shorter<br>periods of time so again some of the<br>things we've learned in that process and<br>just going forward some of the very<br>ending points that I want to make here<br>we think about this utilization as I<br>mentioned one of the big trends that<br>we're seeing is moving although there's<br>still a lot of science to be discovered<br>about the sum of the down whole<br>considerations here including the ones<br>that I just mentioned I think more the<br>conversation is going towards the<br>utilization piece that's clearly what<br>we're seeing from a political level as<br>well as from the industry standpoint all<br>the way down to the exports some of the<br>legal and some of the regulatory and<br>permitting that comes to that and then<br>down to that social license piece what<br>have we learned in that process we learn<br>through these many considerations that<br>we've talked about here<br>how do we apply that into many<br>communities as people are trying to<br>learn understand the science and I think<br>there was a point made in the beginning<br>that even in Texas as well as nationally<br>most people don't if you ask them the<br>question do you know what hydraulic<br>fracturing is which is certainly a buzz<br>word out there or fracking and short<br>most people don't know what it is those<br>that do won't know what it is divided<br>very quickly into two different camps so<br>you know it's very important to<br>recognize there's still a lot of<br>education to go on relative to social<br>licenses people are coming to the store<br>is it shows up in their community and<br>then they want to know what does it mean<br>to us for all those different ways<br>environmental social some of the<br>technical bit of variety different<br>components that are in there and lastly<br>I'm going to leave you with these five<br>questions just some thoughts do to maybe<br>mall around or if you wanted to talk<br>about them quickly and we think about<br>when this starts out in a lot of places<br>shale development on conventional<br>development at a lot of places in the<br>world some some locations like New York<br>it's a it's a stop and hold and work<br>through the process and whatever length<br>of time that is and then start the<br>process potentially going forward<br>potentially because it may not go<br>forward politics again may not be right<br>social acceptance or social license may<br>not be right or a variety of other<br>factors might might step in there or is<br>it a matter of working in sequence or<br>work working in parallel with the<br>development as it's occurring and so the<br>question do you start with a blank sheet<br>or you use something that's already in<br>motion another one they are thinking<br>about this idea about predictability we<br>talk about investment of dollars<br>mentioned a number of times here about<br>the number of dollars we think about<br>this North America wise number of<br>dollars are being spent but there needs<br>to be some kind of commercial viability<br>or predictability therefore before<br>companies before they're going to spend<br>that money a no-brainer certainly<br>recognize that in any type of<br>development that would be the case we're<br>we're talking about in this in this case<br>where there is a social license piece<br>it's much harder it's not so tangible<br>not so easy to measure that then becomes<br>that unpredictability or the change of<br>regulations over the course of time that<br>might not seem so continual but might<br>seem jerkier<br>have a lot more cycle to them to<br>companies than they look at well what<br>are the other locations that we have to<br>develop the resource other than this<br>location so we see that what about this<br>longer-term strategy and is there are<br>the decisions made just about for<br>environmental reasons or is it that all<br>the above that we're looking at all the<br>energy development and what their what<br>the pros and cons and how to mitigate<br>risk and what are the ramifications of<br>one versus the other public involvement<br>how deeply do you involve the public and<br>I use two examples in Norway when they<br>put out something for public comment my<br>Norwegian colleagues will tell me<br>they'll get a couple hundred comments<br>back and a lot of those comments are<br>good comments that actually change the<br>regulations or change the process going<br>forward New York they did the same thing<br>they had several hundred thousand<br>comments so the idea how do you work<br>through that BLM the bureau of land<br>management in the US on public round did<br>the same thing my last comp less than<br>their frack rules the last comment that<br>I heard from then they had 1.7 million<br>comments come back so again how do you<br>work through that process if you're<br>trying to do this in some sort of a way<br>for that makes some kind of sense<br>measured in time or measured in outcome<br>and then the last one about building<br>some kind of stability or trust and<br>that's really comes down to the<br>transparency issue and then any parts</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
