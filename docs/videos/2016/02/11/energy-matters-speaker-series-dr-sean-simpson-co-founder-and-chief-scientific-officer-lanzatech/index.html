Shawn Samson is the chief<br>scientific officer and co-founder of<br>NASA tea and short has a PhD from the<br>University of you are not sure no it's<br>my simulator and his interest in five<br>developments lead him to work and<br>research facilities in Japan Switzerland<br>vienna before coming to New Zealand<br>tablets just yes I met me and then the<br>tip was founded in 2005 and sure Thomas<br>today that he has led for funding rounds<br>associated with bringing negative to<br>commercialization which I guess we will<br>hear about the presentation that's ahead<br>of us how do we also mentioned tonight<br>that Lanza tick is ranked and energy<br>industries in the United States selects<br>an amazing a couple look for a new<br>zealand-born company lens it takes in<br>our basement Chicago and Shawn travels<br>back to New Zealand frequently anteas<br>are really passionate supporter of<br>commercialization in the biotech space<br>so please first I should thank thousand<br>hardly for the invitation and members<br>things for the amazing coordination and<br>then clarify that my PhD really was into<br>my eyes so it was a time when I was one<br>of the ten the world's experts on power<br>to my writings which turns out to be<br>number interesting ok we let the true<br>so yes there with me on this so arrived<br>this morning at 5am as little bit on the<br>playing solo Chicago yesterday so i'm<br>kinda high on coffee and i've never<br>really knew this talk so pretty sure how<br>this is going to go but eventually i'll<br>present a little about trying to change<br>it reading as a presenter ideal about<br>climate change these days which is great<br>I'll talk there about the sustainable<br>fuels industry such as it is really not<br>not so much from the perspective of<br>technology we more from the perspective<br>of feedstocks I'll then present lands of<br>tech and do that in a completely<br>shameless way and then I'll talk a<br>little bit bad the aviation industry and<br>why renewable sustainable fuels are<br>important to it's up to the aviation<br>industry particularly and I'll finish<br>off with some sort of rambling thoughts<br>on what's next and what to think about<br>from from my personal perspective so<br>here goes so carbon carbon it's kind of<br>everywhere the the we're all carbon in<br>this room and hopefully and and and we<br>can't we can't live without it but we<br>know of course that it's problematic<br>when when we burn it was problematic<br>because when we burn carbon containing<br>materials we end up releasing co2 into<br>the atmosphere it's accumulate in the<br>atmosphere now to a point where it's<br>becoming dangerous to human health it's<br>becoming environmentally extremely<br>troublesome and it's going to have<br>serious economic impacts as we go<br>forward but not only that perhaps in May<br>areas of the world perhaps the most<br>immediate impact of the combustion of<br>carbon rich materials is actually<br>pollution so the release of socks knocks<br>etc and particulate matter that are now<br>really choking up the air in many cities<br>and that's becoming one of the major<br>drivers the major urgencies around<br>around invite<br>mental legislation the the as I said<br>climate change is happening it's very<br>clear no need to talk about it it's like<br>we don't need to argue about this and<br>say where we'd have to argue about<br>evolution and and we know that we know<br>that of course the the energy sector<br>that the fuel sector in particular the<br>use of fuels our alliance on fuels is<br>something that's going to have to is<br>going to have to change as we go forward<br>and we're going to have to find more<br>sustainable fuels to fuel our vehicles<br>because the combustion of fuels releases<br>co2 and therefore we have to find some<br>ways of producing fuels that have a<br>lower much lower co2 profile and in fact<br>the international energy agency is is<br>putting figures around there saying you<br>know really what we've got to do is is<br>dis place at least thirty percent of our<br>fuel pool with low carbon fuels they say<br>zero carbon fuels but we're talking low<br>carbon fuels for at least thirty percent<br>of our fuel pool what does that mean<br>what's that mean in practical terms and<br>and what's the challenge associated with<br>this what this means is that we've got<br>to find 450 billion gallons of very low<br>carbon fuels fast and and this is a<br>number i'm going to keep coming back to<br>and this number is derived from the fact<br>that today as as a globe we consume<br>around 90 million barrels of oil per day<br>consumed burn and that all goes in the<br>atmosphere and it's becoming problematic<br>thirty percent of that is 1.2 billion<br>gallons let's call it and all 450 per<br>day or 450 billion gallons annually so<br>that's a that's a that's a pretty<br>serious target and and and the<br>seriousness of that target and the<br>reason for me to focus this talk on<br>feedstocks for renewable fuel production<br>will become evident as a function of<br>that target<br>the use of sustainable fuels is being<br>incentivized globally so governments are<br>mandating that we need to include low<br>carbon or sustainable actually what<br>they're saying is biofuels and we'll<br>come back and I'll keep our kick I'm<br>gonna keep pounding on this word<br>biofuels and you'll see you highlighted<br>in red in this talk and the reason for<br>that will come to that at the end but we<br>the point of this slide is to say<br>governments are mandating the use of<br>sustainable fuels and that of course is<br>a great thing because it's driven an<br>industry driven and awareness and driven<br>a market for these fuels in many many<br>different countries around the world<br>today we really only have a limited<br>number of routes via which we can<br>produce low carbon or sustainable or<br>biofuels we have the fermentation of of<br>either of basically sugars carbohydrates<br>sugars into fuel ethanol or we have the<br>conversion of oils into biodiesel and<br>I'll talk about the relative numbers but<br>but let's be clear these are the only<br>mature technologies that we have<br>available today that's that's that's all<br>we got right now and I'll present that<br>industry but we are developing processes<br>that allow us to access a broader array<br>of feedstocks and they include league no<br>solos operas in a little on that waste<br>gases and that's the lens of tech<br>process and an algae and these between<br>them these that the use of these<br>different feedstocks is is being looked<br>at in the context of both transport<br>fuels for ground transportation and and<br>an end aviation I'll start with ethanol<br>world's favorite biofuel is produced in<br>in huge volumes around the world<br>relatively and it's produced it really<br>is produced globally and if you look at<br>a graph like this you'd be thinking that<br>it's made from all sorts of materials in<br>all sorts of different places in reality<br>three-quarter at least a half of the<br>fuel ethanol in the world is made from<br>corn in the u.s.<br>around a quarter is is made from sugar<br>in Brazil and the rest is made from from<br>wheat or cassava or sugar beet but these<br>are relatively small on these are<br>produced in relatively small amounts<br>compared to corn in the u.s. sugarcane<br>in Brazil and and so in the u.s. from<br>the the production set standard around<br>thirteen point something billion gallons<br>and in Brazil at around six point<br>something billion gallons per annum so<br>we're starting to get a sense if we go<br>back to our number a number is 450<br>billion gallons per annum we're starting<br>to get a sense of the the mountain we<br>still need to climb yeah by diesel<br>biodiesel is made today primarily from<br>from canola rapeseed oil soy oil some<br>palm oil actually when I was when I was<br>preparing for this talk I was surprised<br>at how little is actually produced from<br>from palm given the degree of<br>controversy around the use of that that<br>feedstock but majority is made from from<br>rapeseed all but the total global<br>production today sits at around five<br>billion gallons now you'll notice that<br>the feedstock I've been three stops I've<br>been presenting up until now are all<br>basically farmed foods yeah these are<br>these are the products of agriculture<br>and they are both expensive and they are<br>price volatile so this is this is<br>actually two graphs that present corn<br>prices and versus ethanol corners and<br>blue ethanol's in there whatever that<br>color is gold and in the u.s. from where<br>are we here from to theta from 0 9 to<br>early this year and this here's sugar<br>world sugar prices the world is is the<br>red and the u.s. is is in blue the point<br>being is that these prices are highly<br>volatile they've become increasingly<br>volatile recently which is which is<br>interesting and also I'll show<br>some data later that will go some way to<br>explain that I believe but the point is<br>they are price volatile they are<br>expensive their price volatile and and<br>they come with this incumbent of forcing<br>us to make a decision between the dinner<br>plate and the fuel tank so this is not<br>this is not an argument that's going to<br>go away this is this is a real argument<br>and and you know it's it's it's it's a<br>reality for these fuels if we're going<br>to scale renewable fuel production we<br>can't do it at the expense of food and<br>and why can't we do it the expensive<br>food because right now eighteen percent<br>nearly twenty percent of sugar in the<br>world is used for fuel production so<br>think about so think about get 'less<br>let's go back to our numbers here so<br>sugar today produces what was that six<br>point something billion gallons an hour<br>targets 450 billion gallons per annum<br>you know it's and and right now we're<br>using let's call it a fifth of the sugar<br>harvest for fuel production yet I'm no<br>math genius but we're not gonna get<br>there with sugar so is this is a cool<br>this is that this is a question of<br>feedstock this is this is a discussion<br>about feedstocks on what feedstocks we<br>can use for the production of fuels the<br>other staggering thing here is of course<br>that our population isn't going down<br>globally our population is going up and<br>our demand for fuel is going up over the<br>same time period that we're talking for<br>that people predict the world's<br>population is going to go from seven<br>billion to 8.6 billion over that same<br>time period people predict the<br>prediction is that the demand for energy<br>is going to go up by around forty<br>percent so out 450 billion gallons per<br>year number is a target that's moving<br>and it's moving in one direction and I<br>talked about a little bit about the the<br>price of oil to this probably explains<br>to some degree the price volatility and<br>what you see this is just stops in 2008<br>and I couldn't you know this is<br>talk that's been made by google yeah but<br>it's what I'm just highlighting here is<br>the the dramatic impact that<br>legislations had on global biofuel<br>production this presents both by ethanol<br>and diesel / over recent times and<br>obviously the production's gone gone<br>significantly up and for all the reasons<br>mentioned around around the mandates but<br>also the drive around climate change but<br>of course where we got to with despite<br>this dramatic uplifting in production<br>we've got to six percent of our target<br>of 450 billion gallons annually so we<br>need otherwise so who right now we have<br>a feedstock challenge yeah we need to be<br>able to use new feedstocks to be able to<br>use new feedstocks new inputs for for<br>fuel production low-carbon fuel<br>production we need technologies because<br>today's technologies are clearly not<br>enough because they access feedstocks<br>that we need to eat we don't need to<br>drive on and and ultimately of course<br>the lowest cost technology will dominate<br>reality so one of the ideas that's been<br>kicking down for a very long time I<br>remember going to biofuel conferences in<br>at 10 years ago and we were everybody<br>was tremendously excited about<br>lignocellulose and ice ago I go go's<br>conference every year and every year the<br>the the conference was kind of finished<br>with you know guys we're going to be<br>constructing a facility building<br>constructing a facility that makes<br>ethanol from lignocellulose in the next<br>two years and every year would say that<br>first ten years turns out this year<br>we're all right this year we really did<br>built them as facilities doing this the<br>point I wanted to make here is what is<br>lignocellulose lignocellulose is<br>basically any plant that's not either of<br>algae or a moss so any any plant that<br>stands up more than an algae or a moss<br>is made of lignocellulose lignin plus<br>cellulose it's basically sixty percent<br>celos celos think of solos as a chain of<br>sugar so it's a sugar polymer<br>polymer Henry saw those same thing and<br>lignin is effectively the closest thing<br>that that grows that looks like coal<br>yeah so and plants have evolved over<br>millions of years unfortunately to have<br>these two things intrinsically bound<br>together and inseparable as a defense<br>against the world and our challenge when<br>we want to use lignocellulose as a raw<br>material for fuel production is the<br>first step is to separate this thing<br>that has spent billions of years<br>evolving to become a inseparable mass so<br>first challenge separate it then<br>sacrifice on with a sacrificial mean it<br>means chopping the the celos into 2mon<br>america sugars and then we ferment the<br>same way we ferment any kind of sugar so<br>separation sector of occasion and<br>fermentation those are the three<br>challenges that that we as a scientific<br>or technical community of faced around<br>the use of league no sailors woody<br>biomass for fuels and so a plant that<br>that uses lignocellulose looks something<br>like this where by obviously you have a<br>gregation of the lino sodas and they<br>tend to concentrate on single individual<br>types of biomass so they'll tend to<br>concentrate on a particular type of<br>grass corn stover is a popular one<br>obviously in the states because it's the<br>stuff left behind after a field of corn<br>has been harvested and they'll<br>concentrate on particular type of<br>biomass they'll have a pretreatment that<br>involves blasting apart the<br>lignocellulose then they'll have an<br>enzymatic treatment to break that seal<br>lows down into into mono merrick sugars<br>and then the standard fermentation which<br>has to overcome the various difficulties<br>of of having this kind of commission of<br>a feedstock that's kind of got bits of<br>the breakdown products of lignin in<br>there and there's all kinds of<br>inhibitors there's been a number of<br>challenges faced along the way but these<br>have been overcome and this year some<br>bizarre coincidence three lignocellulose<br>to ethanol plants have been constructed<br>and will and by the end of this year<br>will be operational those three are by<br>dupont in nevada abengoa<br>a Spanish company originally actually<br>but built a place in Kansas and project<br>liberty don't you love that name in in<br>Iowa and that's DSM poet DSM is a<br>manufacturer so they're supplying the<br>sort of microbial and enzymatic<br>technology and poet are a<br>dyed-in-the-wool corn ethanol<br>manufacturer who are trying to get into<br>the lignocellulosic space these guys<br>have done it they've constructed plants<br>now these are the first of a kind yeah<br>so these aren't going to be the most<br>efficient plants in the world they're<br>not gonna be the best plants in the<br>world they are this is the this is the<br>first stake in the ground saying we can<br>convert would interferes at a reasonable<br>scale what do we mean by a reasonable<br>scale we're talking about 30 million<br>gallons 25 million gallon kind of scale<br>now this is small for a corn ethanol<br>plant corn ethanol plants that I are a<br>hundred million gallons scale that's<br>what that's what you build if you're<br>building a corn ethanol plant today but<br>we're not expect him to start off with<br>the hundred million gallon scale we're<br>expecting to start off something a<br>little more modest because we're trying<br>to perfect a technology the challenges<br>that face this industry still and<br>listener and again an industry starts<br>it's not gonna if that doesn't start<br>from with the most efficient process in<br>the world the most cost reduce prices in<br>the world it starts with a process that<br>works and then it gets better and and so<br>the challenges these guys face around<br>the operational cost the cost of buying<br>the the biomass of breaking it apart and<br>digesting it the capital costs some of<br>the capital costs here that have been<br>reported a high so we're talking ten<br>dollars an annual gallon so you think<br>about a plant producing 30 million<br>gallons a year that's three hundred<br>million dollars to build that plant now<br>that's that's a that's significantly<br>more expensive than a corn ethanol plant<br>of equivalent volume yeah breath so the<br>act of being the ability to access a<br>breath of lignocellulosic resource a<br>breath of feedstocks they tend to be<br>very very specific and the technology<br>they developed a process feedstocks<br>very specific to individual plant<br>species and yield the yield is also<br>always going to be challenged by the<br>fact that forty percent of your<br>feedstock cannot be used for fuel<br>production that forty percent being the<br>lignin component of that feedstock and<br>so that right now is generally just burn<br>fur for power so those are the<br>challenges but at but we've got we<br>started and the process of reducing<br>these costs or and overcoming some of<br>these challenges as really begun and I<br>think it's this is this is a<br>tremendously exciting time fuels from<br>Al's all there's a number of players in<br>this game facts a fire and ice a soul<br>design with some trepidation will<br>explain that to companies here of course<br>this is this is addressing a problem at<br>its source this is taking co2 directly<br>out of the atmosphere and and fermenting<br>and converting that co2 into an oil or<br>into an alcohol as I as I'll present<br>next using the pet using energy from<br>sunlight so it's photosynthesis for the<br>production of either an oil that can be<br>used for bio diesel or jet or an alcohol<br>that can be used this ethanol that can<br>be used to displace gasoline it's great<br>because of course it's directly using<br>co2 as the carbon source for fuel<br>production tremendous no competition<br>with food or feed tremendous and can use<br>co2 that's comes straight from the<br>source like a like a coal-fired power<br>station great I say I approached sole<br>design with some trepidation because<br>souls are on always in the news about by<br>the fact that they're using algae to<br>produce fuels the fact is they use LG<br>but they feed them with sugar so this is<br>not this is not a traditional alleble<br>process sign a bacteria or the other<br>this is don't you love this name Elgin<br>or we don't use LG we use a sign of<br>bacteria the bacteria are photosynthetic<br>by bacteria so there's two companies in<br>this space two major companies of the<br>these are just examples Algernon jewel<br>and both user sign of bacteria it's a<br>bacteria photosynthetic bacteria that it<br>doesn't accumulate oils to the degree of<br>analogy what it does is produce ethanol<br>and that ethanol the secure it into the<br>media and and and unlike algae you know<br>you're using co2 directly you're you're<br>avoiding any impact on on arable land or<br>food and so from that perspective this<br>is great this is a technology that's a<br>way off though and the part of some of<br>the reasons for for the distance to<br>commercialization here are the fact that<br>we've got to overcome some serious<br>challenges around water so these are<br>these are organisms that grow in water<br>and and you've got to separate your<br>product from water the the lipids have<br>to be separated from water you got OD<br>water a lot of stuff to get at your<br>lipids the alcohol has to be separated<br>from a lot of water they tend to produce<br>alcohol at very low concentrations in in<br>water land is a major issue we're<br>talking 7,000 gallons let's call it<br>7,000 guns some of the numbers I've<br>heard of it of of fuel production per<br>acre so now let's think about our modest<br>ethanol plant at 30 million gallons per<br>annum and again math isn't my thing but<br>I'm thinking that's a big number so land<br>is an issue and then location yeah so<br>you've got to find a location that's<br>Sonny that has a major source of a major<br>source of of co2 and so this is not this<br>is not something that's going to be<br>applicable in large swaths of northern<br>Europe or Russia or North America this<br>is not a technology that's the suitable<br>for places with with low incidence<br>sunlight it's it's it's it's highly<br>suited to Middle East or deserts in<br>Australia for example but there's some<br>good places to do this those that so in<br>terms of feedstock directly using co2<br>algae lignocellulose we're on that we're<br>on the road i'll talk about land second<br>you and you'll understand a little bit<br>about wife focused on feedstock because<br>lambda tech was a company our company<br>was founded not on the on the basis of a<br>technology but actually a better founded<br>with a feedstock philosophy if you like<br>sounds very grand but it was a it was a<br>conversation in a pub about what was the<br>best what's the best thing from which to<br>produce a sustainable fuel and we didn't<br>know what it was but we had a list that<br>kind of described it so Richard and<br>either who founded the company we sat<br>down we said right what well what would<br>be the feeder with the ideal feedstock<br>would it look like and and three pints<br>in this is the the list it's a<br>feedstocks available today so we're not<br>planting new crops that was that was one<br>of big bugbears we were both plant<br>scientists didn't have to go into crop<br>science it was available today it's<br>available in very high volumes its<br>abundant you know you're not making<br>small small quantities of fuel aren't<br>interesting it has to be point source<br>does that mean it has to be something<br>that's available in a single location we<br>didn't want have to deal with transport<br>costs transport costs are a real big<br>feature of any biomass whatever it is<br>corn lignocellulose to fuel process<br>because you get it there's a tyranny of<br>distance I as you get to a certain<br>distance a certain rate ratio a radius<br>around your plant after that you can no<br>longer afford to transport those crops<br>over so is that was it ten miles at 100<br>miles whatever it is you've got a radius<br>a butt and that defines your your your<br>capture area so points or stiff<br>everything's available in a single<br>location you're better off low value<br>turns out no one likes paying a lot for<br>fuel can understand that and so we<br>didn't want to be in this situation of<br>turning gold into silver and non-food of<br>course been torn on food makes sense and<br>so when you get this list together what<br>you realize that you're talking about is<br>is waste materials we're talking about<br>industrial waste gases we're talking<br>about municipal solid waste it's all<br>about agricultural waste all of which<br>fill that fit those criteria<br>and all of which are either available<br>right now or can be easily converted<br>into gases industrial waste gas<br>obviously exists as a gas both municipal<br>solid waste and and for example<br>agricultural residues can be gasified to<br>produce a guess and that gas is a<br>mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen<br>still male off gases for example a<br>pretty much only carbon monoxide whereas<br>was gasified biomass gasified missile<br>sideways it is is various mixtures of<br>carbon dioxide hydrogen so then we had<br>this challenge so then we have this<br>problem okay so we've decided to find<br>what we need to do we want to convert<br>gases into fuels and chemicals how do<br>you how do we do that and we were plant<br>scientist so we will instantly avoided<br>any kind of plant based technology be<br>was going to do that within your work so<br>so we went on this sort of hunt for a<br>biology and microbiology that could do<br>this and for this hunt is really a kind<br>of hunt through time and so here's is<br>the history of the earth here is the bit<br>is the part to talk to the history<br>lesson history of the earth so earth is<br>formed at 4.8 something billion years<br>ago then then we have the dinosaurs so<br>they came along so 400 million years ago<br>and they hung around for a while they<br>sort of left again about 100 million<br>years ago for reasons unknown and and<br>then we came along sort of 60 million<br>years ago just as a put it all in<br>perspective so so this didn't happen<br>yeah okay it disturbs me this woman<br>looks like Sarah Palin so over this<br>period over this period that the Earth's<br>had three atmospheres we started off<br>with a very reduced atmosphere and that<br>the really awake people in the orders<br>our son get a clue here then we went to<br>the carbon dioxide atmosphere and then<br>the through the the evolution there's<br>that word again of photosynthesis we<br>have we were we now luxuriate in our<br>oxygen-rich atmosphere but of course<br>we're busily trying to get back to that<br>former atmosphere that we liked so much<br>the carbon dioxide rich one but life on<br>Earth is the<br>begun around 3.8 ish<br>three-point-something I mean who's<br>really sure give or take a billion years<br>ago and it's thought of begun in a<br>certain type of hydrothermal vent deep<br>in the ocean where there's a confluence<br>of various metal ions hot gases and<br>gases that are both energy right so you<br>got carbon monoxide you've got methane<br>you've got hydrogen you've got hot<br>hydrogen sulfide coming together with<br>these various metal medals and and this<br>heat and in this kind of cauldron if you<br>like in the deep primordial sea complex<br>molecules start to form complex by<br>molecule saida form with regular<br>patterns those regular pattern decide to<br>interact and slowly over a very very<br>very very long period of time these<br>evolved into the early organisms and<br>these early organisms used gases as<br>their sole source of carbon and energy<br>the first organisms were gas eaters the<br>earliest biochemistry was one that<br>allowed gases to be utilized as a source<br>of both carbon energy carbon and<br>reducing equivalents and it's this it's<br>this biochemistry that it's still found<br>today in certain organisms these organs<br>call decisions that we leverage in our<br>process and these organisms are able to<br>use quite flexibly different mixtures of<br>both carbon monoxide and hydrogen and<br>that allows us to quite flexibly offer a<br>way of producing fuels from various<br>feedstocks from industrial waste gases<br>through municipal solid waste through to<br>agricultural wastes and and and they're<br>really good news is of course the the<br>primordial seat looked a bit like some<br>of the places I get to visit so this is<br>this is a picture of a steel mill<br>anywhere you like in the world and and<br>and it is an environment that's fill of<br>carbon dioxide hydrogen carbon dioxide<br>hydrogen sulfide and methane and and all<br>of these are manna from heaven for a<br>necedah genic bacteria so we've<br>developed a process and by devotes I<br>mean we develop both the biology and the<br>engineering to scale up approach<br>that allows gases to be used the sole<br>source of carbon energy for fuel<br>production and in the first incident<br>talking about fuel ethanol to limit<br>ethanol but we also produce a<br>four-carbon chemical called 23<br>butanediol which i can remember if i<br>mention here but we do just quickly<br>potted history of the company we've been<br>very lucky in raising funds companies<br>found in 2005 I think one of the things<br>that we've done we've been lucky we've<br>had a good opportunity to do and we've<br>when we've done very aggressively is<br>patent our technology when we entered<br>this space there were I think five or<br>six payments in the area of gas<br>fermentation and we went in very<br>aggressively and painted it patented<br>very hard and I guess one of the things<br>i find myself banging on about is that<br>painting is something that here in New<br>Zealand we need to do much better and so<br>that's that's that's a take home if you<br>like our CEO is dr. Jennifer Holmgren<br>she joined the company in 2010 and<br>really took what at that time was an<br>interesting technology through to<br>becoming a very exciting sort of closed<br>to commercial process and and it's been<br>a real privilege to be part of a journey<br>with Jennifer our process has been<br>proven with industrial off gases with<br>reformed methane with gasified municipal<br>solid waste biomass and in future we are<br>looking at the use of co2 as a source of<br>carbon and alternative sources of energy<br>such as hydrogen or even electrons and<br>I'll mention that briefly later on I<br>said that our organism produces this<br>peanut here that's the organism it<br>produces both ethanol and 23 butanediol<br>and and we can toggle between the two so<br>we can we can operate the process such<br>as we increase selectivity for ethanol<br>already increase selectivity for 23<br>butanediol so and that's without<br>modification in the first instance we<br>scaled the process up so we started off<br>with the process in the lab with a test<br>tube an organism we bought from a<br>culture collection we selected four<br>strains that performed had<br>had improved performance and we scaled<br>up firstly in our lab at sort of five or<br>ten leader scale then to a pilot plant<br>that we built in a little the steel mill<br>at glenbrook in New Zealand using in<br>glenbrook weren't easy answer in 2008<br>frankly we had no idea what we're doing<br>then imagine we started off in 2005 with<br>a test tube and no idea what we're doing<br>and then in 2008 we built the part plant<br>we definitely had no idea what we're<br>doing and but it was very very<br>successful because whilst we had no idea<br>what we were doing we'd built something<br>that was other decent size and we had to<br>fix it we had to overcome the challenges<br>and we had to overcome the challenges in<br>the context of a guess that came from<br>the steel mill and in the context of<br>scale and not in the context of a<br>beautiful white lab white-coated lab<br>with everything looking immaculately<br>clean and it turns out that when you<br>bring a Chinese steel maker over from<br>China and and you introduced them to<br>this process that's going to transform<br>his steel industry and you take them<br>into your beautiful lab and you show him<br>this bubbling reactor he looks at you<br>like you're mad so I don't know I don't<br>get it how does this work then you take<br>him to the steel mill which filthy and<br>noisy and horrible and he loves it and<br>he gets it because there's a steel mill<br>and there's your process that it's<br>working and so it became probably our<br>greatest marketing tools as much as as<br>much as they're our learning ground for<br>scale-up we then scaled up to a pre<br>commercial demo which we've actually<br>operated two of these in in China we<br>operate another demo in Taiwan and this<br>year we will be breaking ground touching<br>all things wouldn't in with our first<br>commercial operation we focused on the<br>steel industry in the first instance why<br>did we do that because there was a steel<br>mill in New Zealand that wasn't a<br>gasifier and so we had access to still<br>making off gases and we were desperate<br>to make our process relevant to an<br>established available feedstock and our<br>feedstock view of the world steel<br>industry is interested 300 billion<br>gallons of ethanol capacity go back to<br>our number that's annual ethanol<br>duction potential from the steel<br>industry alone now that assumes lots of<br>things like we get to build a plant at<br>every single Steelman in the world and<br>use all of their guess which is unlikely<br>but that's the potential it's it's it's<br>tremendous we've formed to joint<br>ventures in China with two major steel<br>companies bow still probably the largest<br>steelmaker in China and show goong<br>fourth largest steelmaker in China both<br>using different off gases decided to bit<br>or different gas sources decided they<br>wanted to build a demonstration plant<br>and we've operated those in the last two<br>years and they in each case hit the ball<br>at the park in terms of operations and<br>you know actually I don't know of<br>another process where the demo actually<br>performed beyond its its spec and and<br>and that was that was really satisfying<br>and not not that it was easy it was it<br>was horrible Hobart sir but we did it<br>and and here's some data so and this is<br>probably one nervous about the camera<br>but the this is two months of data<br>continuous production at one of our<br>plants and what I wanted to show here is<br>not that okay we've been producing for<br>two months continuously from a real live<br>feed from a steel mill what I wanted to<br>show is actually that you know<br>happens and and when you're operating a<br>plant in the real world that scale from<br>a process that you developed at a tiny<br>test tube in laboratory you have no idea<br>what you're going to face when you get<br>to the real world because it turns out<br>this is very frustrating that the steel<br>mill doesn't actually operate its mill<br>to help you they just want to make steel<br>and and so they keep turning the thing<br>off when it suits them and or changing<br>the process or having a new new<br>contaminant in the guess they didn't<br>tell you about and so you know when<br>you're operating therefore continuously<br>for two months you get to experience all<br>of this stuff and if you've got a great<br>team which fortunate we do we were able<br>to overcome those processes those those<br>challenges they occur we have another<br>operation in Taiwan same sort of thing<br>we've also dedicated a lot of effort to<br>maximizing the efficiency of the process<br>such that we consume the max<br>amount of gas gas in our specialized<br>bioreactor and a single pass very very<br>important because you don't want to be<br>recycling guess you ought to be<br>consuming it all in one go so now we can<br>actually consume sort of over ninety<br>percent of the feed gas and a single<br>pass in our reactor I went to a well<br>that now so environmental impact we have<br>a co2 impact we also have an impact and<br>I'll talk about about the co2 impact<br>later but one of the things I think is<br>really important that from a mention<br>this earlier is in places like China in<br>the major cities in China the driver for<br>environmental legislation turns out not<br>to really be global warming it turns out<br>to be the fact the airs toxic and and so<br>you've got to deal with you've got to<br>deal with air pollution before you deal<br>with anything else and legislation has<br>to be put in place to deal with that and<br>it's going to be and and one of the<br>things that we've been promoting of<br>course is that our process really does<br>that from the steel industry the steel<br>mill today has obviously it makes steel<br>producing a bunch of gases it can use<br>those gases for electricity generation<br>and and feed the grid or it can use<br>those gangsters in a process like ours<br>our process allows thirty-three percent<br>less co2 to be emitted per mega Joule of<br>energy recovered that's that's a good<br>thing but it also allows eighty percent<br>fewer particulates and forty percent<br>less knocks to be emitted from that<br>steel mill so now you're really talking<br>about having an impact on the immediate<br>environmental issues that associated<br>with with large-scale industrial<br>production greenhouse gas the all about<br>all of our carbon life cycle analysis<br>are done by third parties we've had<br>these validated by the round table for<br>sustainable biomaterials and and we see<br>a fifty to seventy percent reduction in<br>greenhouse gas or co2 emission through<br>the use of ethanol to displace gasoline<br>obviously displace oil from our process<br>and of course it's a good economic case<br>such that we can offer 2x the revenue<br>per volume of gas<br>process that can be offered for that can<br>be generated by power or the can be<br>derived from power generation we have a<br>we have a root two chemicals I won't<br>spend too long on this but the 23<br>butanediol can be used as an<br>intermediate for the production of 13<br>butadiene 13 butadiene is a very large<br>or is a chemical intermediate used for<br>the production of rubber so it's it's a<br>market around 22 billion dollars a year<br>and we have partnerships with the likes<br>of SK in Vista and a company called<br>aurochem to process 23 butanediol into<br>13 butadiene and and and supplied to<br>investor who are the world's major nylon<br>producer and we have a focus on on on<br>synthetic biology to engineer the<br>microbe to allow us to produce new and<br>exciting materials from the same gas<br>resources that we can access and I think<br>this is this is something we've put a<br>lot of effort into we've made great<br>progress the natural microbe makes<br>ethanol to jerry buting dale now we can<br>offer the production of for example<br>isopropanol which is a precursor for<br>propylene polypropylene plastics acetone<br>butanol 3hb so and so forth get the list<br>goes on so today we produced around 20<br>different molecules from this organism<br>by engineering the pathways in the<br>organism to redirect carbon into into<br>into into new products this to me is is<br>it's tremendously exciting why is it<br>exciting because we're able now if we're<br>producing for example plastics from<br>these gases we're talking about carbon<br>capture and utilization carbon capture<br>and and monetization carbon becomes a<br>feedstock a real feedstock and carbon<br>monoxide is very clearly the precursor<br>to carbon dioxide carbon monoxide only<br>ever ends its life as carbon dioxide<br>basically for a minute from industrial<br>source and so if you can monetize carbon<br>if you can fix carbon in materials that<br>that's a that's a huge win aviation<br>this is an industry that desperately<br>needs a biofuel why does it desperately<br>the biofuel because I would suggest that<br>no one in this room will get into an<br>electrically powered plane yeah we can<br>see electric powered cars got it yeah I<br>can trust that electrically powered<br>plane no way and and they get that yeah<br>no one's talking about electrically<br>powered planes for that very reason but<br>also and and so there's an industry that<br>fully loaded 727 consumes 16 tons of<br>fuel taking off so the volumes are big<br>yeah and so the the price of their gas<br>is volatile and legislation is coming in<br>place right now to penalize that<br>industry particularly in Europe that<br>industry is being penalized and so<br>they've motivated now to ensure and I've<br>got to get the wording of this right<br>though that formal commitment to be to<br>have carbon neutral growth by 2020 what<br>does that mean that as that industry<br>grows that their footprint will not grow<br>with it and and so they're desperate to<br>find routes to to new fuels there's a<br>bunch of routes that that are out there<br>these are depicted here SAS hole with<br>the first to develop a new type of gas<br>that didn't get there sorry a new type<br>of aviation fuel that didn't come from<br>from gasoline but it did use coal or<br>natural gas key or a coupling the states<br>the vote to pyrolysis technology they've<br>gone some through some rough rocky times<br>recently but they had a they have a<br>pyrolysis process to basically take<br>would turn it into an oil that can be<br>upgraded to aviation fuel the algae guys<br>of course want to use their oils for<br>aviation fuel and then you have the the<br>alternative alcohol producers such as<br>jebo and cobalt who are fomenting sugars<br>into butanol isobutanol n-butanol<br>respectively and ourselves who are all<br>looking at alcohol to get a new process<br>a TJ and we're looking to certify that<br>process in order to produce high volumes<br>of jet fuel for the aviation industry I<br>should quickly mention here amorous a<br>Marissa a company again they're<br>fermenting sugars to produce a 15 cub<br>molecule called partisan this is<br>fascinating p<br>here the penalty that's fanzine and<br>they're doing this in collaboration with<br>total they did a flight this year with a<br>goal I don't know the first week or goal<br>Brazilian airline flying from Atlanta no<br>Orlando to South Pole Oh within a plane<br>containing using fuel that was ten<br>percent fanzine so that's that's on its<br>way I want to quickly talk about a TJ<br>alcohol to jet that's a process that<br>we're we're heavily involved in in<br>looking to certify as RG boat and cobalt<br>they're using butanol we're using<br>ethanol the the alcohol is produced by<br>our respective technologies and then<br>that alcohol is dehydrated oligomers so<br>made into a chain and hydrogenated and<br>turn into a jet the really good news is<br>that the guys who certified jet fuel are<br>pretty meticulous a two year process I<br>fly a lot so I'm quite happy that they<br>spend a lot of time making sure that<br>feels good and we're going through that<br>process now to certify a process for the<br>production of jet fuel from from<br>alcohols the atj alcohol to jet process<br>and we're about I think two-thirds of<br>the way through that that certification<br>track now our partner or so our fuel<br>looks very good so the way you get this<br>this thing certify is one you get the<br>fuel analyze it meet your meats punch<br>suspects then you go through engine<br>testing various scales using various<br>volumes for batch consisting that's<br>because inconsistency in etc this is<br>just a slide showing the properties of<br>the fuel produced from ethanol are<br>matched those that the STM recommend it<br>or deem necessary for it for a jet fuel<br>we can do this because we can produce<br>fuel ethanol at very low cost and<br>obviously what we're looking to do is<br>take it ethanol molecules and join them<br>into end so the final a single molecule<br>of jet fuel will be multiple molecules<br>of ethanol joined together and you can<br>only really make that pay if you can<br>produce the ethanol low cost in the<br>front end<br>and we got some good partners on this we<br>have virgin atlantic as an offtake<br>partner and they're committed to buy<br>whatever jet fuel we produce through<br>through this process so a few closing<br>thoughts I've still got I've got two<br>minutes if you closing thoughts policy<br>so this will talk about bio what's bio<br>got to do with anything what why biofuel<br>why do we want to be why do we care that<br>a fuel is made from biomass personally I<br>think it's my personal view is it's it's<br>a kind of misguided focus it's a very<br>easy thing to sell politically but it<br>doesn't make any sense because actually<br>what we want to do is not consume<br>biomass for the production and fuel what<br>we want to do is produce a fuel that<br>emits less carbon so we should be<br>talking about low carbon fuels we<br>shouldn't be talking about biofuels we<br>should be much more policy should be<br>much more technology agnostic and it's<br>in its approach to this space allowing<br>innovators to develop fuels that allow<br>less caught the result in less less or<br>fewer carbon emissions today for example<br>we can produce electricity very cheaply<br>without terminal carbon production solar<br>today in many geographies is competitive<br>with electricity produced from coal<br>carbon is needed not for electricity<br>production it's not therefore we can we<br>can detach co2 emission from electricity<br>production to some degree in some places<br>but it is needed for chemicals it is<br>needed for energy dense fuels that are<br>in aviation and our our view is that we<br>should think about recycling cup we<br>don't think about we recently think<br>about recycling plastic bottles we don't<br>think about recycling carbon and that<br>needs to become part of our our lexicon<br>doesn't know whether it says our process<br>does that with every ton of fuel ethanol<br>we produce from a steel mill we have we<br>avoid the the emission of 1.8 tons of<br>carbon three tons of particulate matter<br>three kilograms of particulate matter<br>and numerous kilograms of of NOx and<br>socks and this is why this is important<br>this is the this is what the heirs like<br>in Auckland in terms of particulate<br>matter in the air PM 2.5 level of 10<br>that's what Auckland's like and we<br>lovely that's what it's like in Delhi<br>152 this is what it's like in major<br>cities in China and and so it's actually<br>these these issues are driving<br>environmental legislation in these<br>countries in the same way they drove<br>environmental environmental legislation<br>in Northern Europe and in the states in<br>the earlier part of last century why buy<br>our keep making this point why bio but<br>bio is irrelevant what is relevant is<br>what the fuel what the how the fuel<br>performs how the fuel performs in terms<br>of its impact on co2 emission and so we<br>we as a society shouldn't care whether<br>or not a farmer was employed to make a<br>fuel that's low carbon because our aim<br>is to avert climate change or slow<br>climate change and that's about low co2<br>so this quickly so one of the things<br>that we were working on Wednesday is the<br>direct use of co2 and that's a process<br>is very very this is a very as most<br>cutting-edge prices we're doing this in<br>collaboration of the University of North<br>America electro synthesis is the is the<br>is the process whereby electrons can be<br>used as a source of energy for co 2<br>fixation these organisms can can can use<br>electrons as a source of reducing<br>equivalents and a new co2 as a source of<br>carbon it's exciting its earlier stage<br>than algae so it's more than ten years<br>away concluding conclusion there for my<br>viewers we need we need to have ever we<br>need diversification we need a<br>diversification of the of the energy<br>options and we need diversification of<br>the feedstocks that we<br>access for the production of low carbon<br>fuels because the mountain we have to<br>climb is measured in hundreds of<br>billions of gallons of annual production<br>of low carbon fuels and the available<br>technologies we have today simply won't<br>get us anywhere near that there'll be an<br>order of magnitude off so we have to<br>think we have to think about<br>diversification and we have to broaden<br>our view as to as to how we approach the<br>area of sustainable boot fuel production</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
