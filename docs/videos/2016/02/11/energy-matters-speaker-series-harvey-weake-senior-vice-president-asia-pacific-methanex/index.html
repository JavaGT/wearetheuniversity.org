automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks a Basel very nice words there<br>I've got to watch my p's and q's tonight<br>I I have a former CEO in the room with<br>us tonight Mr Brian Hannon who is our<br>methan X's first CEO uh back in 1992 or<br>3 something like that so welcome Brian<br>uh so uh so the this evening I'm going<br>to be spending a little bit of time<br>talking about uh you know<br>you know supply and demand from a Global<br>Perspective uh and then I'll finish off<br>by touching on New Zealand so I was just<br>going to spend a few minutes talking<br>about methanex and what we do uh the<br>methanol that we produce where does that<br>go uh so I've got a 30 uh 30C uh sound<br>clip that I'll play there just to that<br>explains it much better than I can uh a<br>little bit about energy and planning<br>where we've come from uh back in the mid<br>2000s where we are today what have we<br>learned from that uh a little bit about<br>um a supply response to the changes that<br>are going on around us uh a demand<br>response<br>scenario uh and a little bit about what<br>we're doing in the space and perhaps<br>some takeaways or some ideas to consider<br>for where New Zealand should position<br>itself so on that I'll just uh play a<br>so yeah so we're A5 billion company<br>today we've got a th000 employees we<br>operate in 15 different countries uh we<br>produce methanol looks like just like<br>water um it's an alcohol it's a a single<br>carbon chain you can't drink the stuff<br>if you do drink it you only get to do it<br>once uh and uh it's a very versatile<br>molecule so it's used uh for industrial<br>applications all over the world uh about<br>uh so as I said it looks like water if<br>you burn it it looks it's colorless when<br>it burns uh you can only see it at night<br>time it uh glows with a with a blue<br>flame uh the nd500 races uh racing car<br>drivers use it for um the nd500 races<br>and they've been using that for for many<br>years um it's primarily uh consume<br>produced from natural gas about 60% of<br>the world's Supply comes from natural<br>gas 40% from coal uh and then uh that's<br>pretty much it really uh the traditional<br>applications about 2/3 of the methanol<br>produced goes into traditional<br>applications uh traditional applications<br>are things like form alide form alide<br>resin AIC acid methyl methacrylate um<br>all that sort of stuff uh and it goes on<br>to producing pharmaceutical drugs paints<br>solvents uh spandex gortex um polyester<br>fibers so that ends up in clothing uh<br>ends up as Vitamin B it ends up as um<br>adhesives uh laptops uh computer screens<br>um flat stream<br>TVs uh cell phones water bottles it's<br>all around us so so about 2third of the<br>world's uh demand goes into into<br>traditional<br>applications and that's growing at about<br>the rate of I industrial production so<br>if the world's growing at 3% that<br>sector's growing at just a little over<br>3% then you've got the energy sector and<br>that's growing uh at double digits a<br>year it's one of the fastest growing<br>commodity sectors in the world uh and uh<br>so the methanol that's going into energy<br>is primarily into uh gasoline blending<br>into into making biodiesel so 12% of<br>your biodel manufacturer contains<br>methanol uh it's used to produce<br>synthetic LPG which is a a<br>dimethylether it's used to produce uh<br>Olin an MTO process it's primarily in<br>China uh the Olan is used to produce<br>polypropylene uh mostly and polyethylene<br>uh which are used to make water bottles<br>and all sorts of stuff and then there's<br>a portion that goes into that's that's<br>developing Market is in Marine fuels to<br>replace uh bunkers if you remember the<br>Reena that ran ran ground in the Bay of<br>Plenty some years ago uh the bunkers<br>that came ashore was that that really<br>heavy stuff at the bottom of the uh<br>barrel of oil uh so we replace uh marine<br>diesel oil in the Baltic Sea uh in 2016<br>onwards with effectively methanol type<br>fuel so that's one of the threads that<br>we're looking at at the moment so so the<br>methanol molecule is is a very versatile<br>uh Beast uh with Incredible growth<br>applications and energy substitution of<br>oil products so as a company uh we need<br>to do a little bit of uh thinking about<br>how methanol fits into the broader<br>picture and so you know we make a<br>billion dollar uh bets each time we make<br>an investment in a methanol plant you<br>get no change out of a billion us today<br>it's a 20-year bet and and when you do<br>that bet you need to understand what<br>your feed stock is you need to<br>understand what the security of that<br>feed stock is you need to understand<br>what your Sovereign risk is and what are<br>your other commercial risks uh for such<br>a a large investment so for us you know<br>if you can see that uh if we're too<br>conservative in our assumptions we'll<br>lose our lead leadership position others<br>will invest in the industry and and we<br>become less and less relevant if we're<br>too aggressive we stand to lose our<br>shirts if if we uh get it wrong in terms<br>of uh you know making uh incorrect um<br>Investments based on incorrect<br>assumptions so there's a fine balance<br>between being too aggressive and being<br>too<br>conservative typical of of any other<br>energy companies in the space so it's<br>it's a it's a high stakes game and we've<br>got to spend a lot of time focusing on<br>on what we believe are good assumptions<br>going<br>forward so if we take a look back to the<br>mid 2000s just going back eight years<br>what did the world look like back then<br>uh clearly very very different from<br>where we are today so oil was at $40 a<br>barrel or or less we had uh a total<br>disconnect between the Commodities<br>market like methanol like ammonia Ura uh<br>from the oil industry we also had a a an<br>LNG Market that was this is liquefied<br>natural gas that was a a very very small<br>Club of suppliers and Niche customers<br>mostly in Asia that represented about 4%<br>of global oil supply in energy terms so<br>very small energy player in the in in<br>the world scheme of things we had coal<br>running at about $40 a ton uh with<br>Chinese coal consumption at 2.2 billion<br>I've picked out China because of the<br>change that's occurred so China's grow<br>was at 2.2 billion tons a year which<br>represented about a third of the global<br>oil supply and energy equivalent terms<br>to give you a sense of proportion so the<br>Chinese imported coal is basically you<br>know most of the coal around the world<br>is is a domestic uh commodity uh it's<br>not very well traded uh and China was no<br>exception so 1% of its coal consumption<br>was imported thermal coal oh sorry 1% of<br>global trade was was imported coal into<br>China Shell Gas back in 2005 wasn't even<br>heard of uh the shell phenomenon in the<br>North America wasn't even on our radar<br>screen uh and the US was forecasted to<br>grow by 10 million tons a year of LG<br>Imports so many players in the US were<br>busy building LNG uh re uh import uh<br>regasification terminals uh ready to<br>receive uh investment uh in<br>LG so here we are you know and gas<br>pricing was heading towards oil parody<br>or so the OPEC oil ministers had us<br>believe and so on the basis of these<br>assumptions we ended up we I mean the<br>industry went ahead and built tremendous<br>number of l&amp; plants mostly in ch in in<br>Australia and in Qatar so but also you<br>know a few other places around as well<br>and so this this forecasted boom in LG<br>was underwriting the Investments that<br>were occurring in Australia so and yet<br>some of the molecules obviously go into<br>the Asian markets but this underpinned<br>those those investment<br>decisions and now you sort of roll on<br>sort of 8 years and see how it's<br>different so we've got oil tracking at<br>just over $100 a barrel the uh<br>conventional oil supply remains<br>unchanged at about 81 82 million barrels<br>a day it hasn't really changed much in<br>total now that's excluding the<br>unconventionals like the Shale and the<br>and the tar Sands in Canada methanol Now<br>tracks oil on an energy parody basis so<br>energy equivalency of gasoline in terms<br>of the BTUs per per gallon or gig per<br>liter uh the the uh the it's it's it<br>trades on energy parody LG is now much<br>more widely U um uh there's a more<br>liquid market for it so there's a lot<br>more trades in in LG today more players<br>and it represents a you know it's<br>doubled in scale so it's now just under<br>300 million tons a year of of scale 8%<br>of the world's<br>Supply uh coal is now trading at $100 a<br>ton it's taken a little dip uh more<br>recently as as solid energy would ATT<br>test too<br>and uh China's coal consumption is<br>running at at 3.8 billion tons a year so<br>3.8 billion is about 50% of the world's<br>conventional oil supply in terms of<br>energy content equivalency so China's<br>grown dramatically it now represents a<br>quarter of world thermal uh coal trade<br>Shale has become significant I'll talk<br>on that in in in a little while and us<br>is heading for you know energy<br>self-sufficiency in the space of 8 years<br>it's gone from being an<br>importer that was expected by all the<br>experts in the industry was going to go<br>for an importer from import status to to<br>self-sufficiency status in the space of<br>eight years and here you are you know<br>making 20-year bets how do you reconcile<br>these Bets with this level of change<br>that's going<br>on so clearly you know forecasts are<br>wrong so doesn't doesn't matter what<br>anyone says you know your forecast are<br>never never right it's really comes down<br>to um getting some basic assumptions<br>correct<br>and just picking the trend is is<br>difficult enough as it is you even then<br>you got a one and two chance of being<br>wrong so you know that's really tough uh<br>you know there's incredible complexity<br>of factors uh we think of uh the oil<br>supply is being in a bit bit of a bubble<br>but but against that backdrop you've got<br>incredible complexity with regard to<br>what goes on with demand drivers and in<br>economies economic growth and<br>substitution effects that go on uh and<br>number of complexities that go on<br>between on the demand side in addition<br>to the supply side so you add that<br>together and it's not surprising that no<br>one can really pick what's going to<br>happen uh we completely missed the<br>global financial crisis I remember<br>meeting investment analysts in September<br>2008 and uh October it hit and uh<br>completely blindsided and and I'd say<br>everyone in our industry was was it's<br>easy in hindsight yeah we knew no we<br>didn't really know we were just we just<br>carried on until we were forced to adapt<br>to that new reality uh once the uh<br>months uh after October 2008 set in we<br>underestimated completely the Chinese<br>growth uh and we continued to over over<br>the years we continued to underestimate<br>uh how they would accomplish their their<br>objectives uh we got most of the<br>geopolitics right in terms of who is<br>going to do who what to who but uh we<br>got the timing wrong it it it's happened<br>much much faster the the Arab Spring has<br>occurred so much faster than we ever<br>expected and we've got you know a<br>billion dollar investment in Egypt so<br>every day for us is a bonus and then we<br>have uh you know clearly risks you know<br>risks in eight years risks have<br>definitely gone up uh and so how does<br>that how does that uh square with uh you<br>know investment<br>strategies so and and why is all this<br>occurring well you know some of you will<br>have heard of uh you know and read books<br>on peak oil and and uh you know peak oil<br>you know the end is nigh and and we have<br>to wean ourselves off oil and and uh you<br>know the world's a gloomy place and you<br>know this plot here just shows the the<br>fossil fuel endowment that the youth has<br>uh spread over 500 years I suspect<br>there's a fair amount of poetic license<br>in this graph this is taken from David<br>archbold's uh presentation I'm not sure<br>where he got it from uh but clearly you<br>know it does sort of roughly make sense<br>to me anyway but you've got oil natural<br>gas coal and natural gas in terms of the<br>consumption uh this is of deliverability<br>annual deliverability of of the product<br>expressed in uh uh barrels of oil<br>equivalency against time and it clearly<br>states that there's a it is a finite<br>resource there there's no getting around<br>the fact that you know these fossil<br>fuels are a finite resource they<br>represent historical<br>sunlight uh you know organic matter is<br>converted into into fossil fuels uh it<br>just represents historical sunlight and<br>so that historical sunlight has already<br>been so it is finite uh and uh what what<br>it shows really is today uh we're about<br>halfway through our endowment of oil uh<br>a little bit less on coal and a little<br>bit less again on natural gas so is this<br>what's causing the change uh that's<br>occurred since 2005 to<br>2013 so you know oil going from $40 a<br>barrel to $100 a barrel is it because<br>we've got scarcity of of fossil fuels so<br>my personal view is that this has got<br>nothing to do with it uh and and I think<br>you know there's a there's a heap of<br>fossil fuels around that's that<br>certainly in the next couple of decades<br>it's not about the story there is plenty<br>of reserves available the issue is this<br>in my view uh this is all about OPEC and<br>OPEC is uh you know it's it's you know<br>OPEC is the organiz ation of petroleum<br>exporting countries it's the biggest<br>Monopoly cartel in the world if it was<br>companies doing what OPEC does would be<br>in jail so you're not allowed to do what<br>they do if it's private Enterprise but<br>because our sovereign states this<br>represents the biggest cartel in the<br>world and so this Monopoly power gives<br>rise to incredible amount of conflict<br>and and uh and there are all sorts of<br>issues going on behind the scenes in<br>terms of power play and man there's a<br>lot of stuff goes on here here so so<br>OPEC represents about 30 million barrels<br>a day of oil supply so the world's<br>consuming give will take about 90<br>million a day today so about a third of<br>the oil supply comes out of OPEC today<br>and yet they have 78% of the oil<br>reserves and we think oh okay that's<br>doesn't seem so so right so the oil<br>reserves so in the industry in the<br>Upstream industry you measure the one of<br>the key uh um metrics that people follow<br>is reserves to production ratio r2p so<br>in the western world or in the in the<br>non OPEC world you have about 11 years<br>of coverage for the production that you<br>produce and the reason for that is that<br>why would you have 20 years or 30 years<br>of coverage because it doesn't make<br>economic sense to be putting investment<br>into into getting a capital return in 20<br>years time so you put in enough Capital<br>to have enough cover in front of you as<br>you're going along so in in the non-opc<br>world you you're governed by a lot of<br>financial discipline and a lot of um you<br>know the weighted cost of capital is a<br>really very strict criteria so in OPEC<br>you've got um 80 years of of cover now<br>the implications of 80 years of cover so<br>it represents 78% of the oil reserves<br>worldwide and 30% of the<br>production and over the next couple of<br>decades that reserves to production or<br>that the the remaining reserves after 20<br>years are going to be about they<br>represent about 90% of the remaining oil<br>reserves in the world in 20 years time<br>so do you think the power of OPEC is<br>going to increase with time or decrease<br>just just figure that one out and if you<br>think it's going to go up should we be<br>do doing something about it and and what<br>should governments be doing about it and<br>you know we're just blindly blindly<br>following along if if we just assume<br>that this is okay and and you know I<br>hate monopolies doesn't matter who you<br>are you know but government monopolies<br>are the worst of all and governments get<br>banned together and for Monopoly that's<br>got to be the worst of the lot so you<br>know so these are not necessarily my<br>friends so this graph here is a is a<br>graph that's taken from David archal uh<br>this is a graph that represents the cost<br>of oil the price of oil in in constant<br>$210 over two time periods the first<br>time period is is 1994 to<br>2004 uh and it's against cumulative uh<br>production you know World production of<br>oil so the first uh the blue line just<br>represents the fact that we increased<br>the production Supply around the world<br>for not a lot of uh change in price it<br>seems reasonable and then you've got the<br>red line that shows from 2004 to 2011<br>you've got this big big increase in the<br>price of oil so you'd expect you know<br>economics 101 price of price of oil goes<br>up you'd think Supply would follow<br>wouldn't you most people would do that<br>well of course it's happened in the<br>western world it's happened in the<br>non-opc world but in OPEC the flight the<br>the the supply is constant at 30 million<br>a day through that time so if that's not<br>Monopoly behavior in action don't know<br>what it<br>is so what we've seen so I've talked<br>about OPEC now what about non OPEC well<br>let's just take a look at the US for a<br>second and so the US is is a very<br>competitive very transparent economy<br>it's probably the most efficient economy<br>in the world uh you've got here the the<br>uh here's this little are is so so this<br>is uh oil equivalency production so 15<br>million barrels a day going all the way<br>up to 21 million barrels a day so from<br>from the 1980s right through to 2005 it<br>it it dropped down and reached a low of<br>15 million barrels a day of of oil uh<br>production and then something happened<br>so in 2005 2006 we had this massive<br>increase you know there's clearly a a<br>response to high oil price these guys<br>had got off their chuff and actually<br>gone ahead deployed new technology uh<br>horizontal drilling uh hydraulic<br>fracturing of of shower Rock uh<br>deploying new technology and Innovation<br>uh in a very very competitive<br>environment and and everyone's going<br>hell for leather so you've had this<br>massive increase in oil supply and and<br>natural gas supply in the US driven by<br>this Innovation that's driven off the<br>high price of oil so here we have is a a<br>supply response to a high priced<br>environment in a in a well run<br>competitive open transparent economy<br>this is what happens so you got a 5<br>million barrel increase in the space of<br>you know five six seven years uh and<br>that trend is set to continue so by 2020<br>we're expecting you know but like the<br>earlier slides we're expecting the US to<br>be self-sufficient in<br>energy so you know maybe that will<br>change but certainly based on what we're<br>seeing so far that trend is still set to<br>continue so the sh gas resource is<br>absolutely<br>enormous so You' think okay well does<br>that you know collapse the price of oil<br>you know if if that keeps on going so<br>Saudi Arabia alone produces 10 million<br>barrels a day for export this is now 20<br>so it's twice the size of Saudi Arabia<br>so the oil that's going on the oil<br>production and gas production in North<br>America is is absolutely enormous so so<br>what's happening is that the incremental<br>demand that's that's being expressed in<br>in China and India and and some of the<br>growing economies around the world uh<br>basically the oil is being re uh the<br>supply chain is being rejigged and so<br>what's happening is that the volume of<br>oil that's displaces here is going into<br>the developing world<br>economies so so you know if you look at<br>the sh gas in North America and say okay<br>would would that apply elsewhere you<br>know can that apply in other parts of<br>the world is is there sh Rock just in<br>North America or is it everywhere well<br>actually I don't know whether you can<br>see that too well but uh you know North<br>America clearly has uh you know about<br>you know of the order of about 100 Years<br>of supply of of sh gas uh there we've<br>got uh the horn River Basin and in uh<br>Northeastern British Columbia and Canada<br>uh big resource there uh since we've<br>since this graph's been put together<br>we've got uh there the big resources in<br>Argentina there's now resources in<br>Northeast England uh there's Eastern<br>Europe uh we've got South Africa's got<br>big resources of shale China's got big<br>resources in the west of China uh<br>Australia's Got resources in the coopa<br>Basin sh gas and little old New<br>Zealand's Got uh resources as we're<br>figuring in out now in the uh east coast<br>of the north Ireland so there's clearly<br>a lot of sh around now the question then<br>is that the the value that and the and<br>the change that's occurred in the US<br>could that be replicated<br>everywhere so so my view is that<br>probably not there are three things that<br>are very unique to North America or<br>unique to the US the first is property<br>rights so the land owner owns the<br>resources below the ground pretty much<br>everywhere else in the world that<br>doesn't occur so where that doesn't<br>occur the the land owner and the<br>resource companies are usually in a bit<br>of conflict because well don't mess with<br>my land it's and we see that pretty much<br>everywhere we go except in America and<br>the America in America the land owners<br>are are are really pushing hard at this<br>because this is a lot better than<br>farming uh<br>grain so so that's one factor the second<br>factor is uh there is an incredible<br>complexity of pipeline infrastructure<br>and and gas processing facilities in<br>North America that no other continent<br>has or no other country has so anywhere<br>in North America you're not too far away<br>from a pipeline you can get pipeline<br>liquids and pipeline uh gas into that<br>connect it up and it's an inter<br>interconnection agreement right across<br>the US economy so you can find gas in<br>North Dakota and have a customer in New<br>York and yet the molecues not don't<br>necessarily follow that way but they'll<br>just balance out into the network<br>nowhere else does that so you can get<br>gas to Market very very quickly so<br>that's a second competitive Advantage no<br>one else can replicate that<br>today uh and the third one is<br>competition so you've got unbelievable<br>amount of competition in the oil<br>industry in in the North American uh<br>scene if anyone's been to Houston you'll<br>get an appreciation of the scale that<br>you're talking about there but the uh<br>the the level of competition and<br>Innovation and the number of players<br>you're talking about thousands of<br>suppliers here you know thousands and<br>thousands of of suppliers of services<br>Niche Services you know and and all of<br>them have their own specialty and<br>they've got so much scale they can<br>specialize and really you know no one<br>else can actually beat that today now so<br>so that's why our viewers that you know<br>it's unlikely to be replicated elsewhere<br>at least for some time it might<br>eventually but not for some<br>time so there are three constraining<br>factors that basically say that this is<br>really more a North American story than<br>than a global<br>story so I've talked a little bit about<br>Supply uh just switch gears and just<br>talk a little bit about a demand<br>response because what I wanted to do is<br>is is give you an idea of the<br>interlinkage with oil and and what else<br>is going around on around us very few<br>people would give any comprehension to<br>the fact that oil has a relationship to<br>food and it's a very very tight<br>relationship so the world produces about<br>2.2 billion tons of grains a year to<br>feed 6.6 billion people on the planet<br>now of the 2.2 billion tons of food<br>about one and a 1.1 billion tons of that<br>would not exist without nitrogen<br>fertilizers of some sort or another you<br>know different different types of<br>fertilizer but fundamentally it's<br>nitrogenous fertilizer produces half the<br>world's protein and you can't get away<br>from that fact and so and when we call<br>it agricultural productivity call it<br>what you like but fundamentally you've<br>got nitrogenous fertilizer going into<br>producing food nitrogenous fertilizer<br>comes from two sources either coal or<br>natural gas natural gas is linked to LG<br>LG is indexed oil not surprising that<br>the price of fertilizer is linked to the<br>price of oil not surprising therefore<br>that the price of food is linked to the<br>price of oil and in fact about 60% of<br>the operating costs of making wheat is<br>the cost of energy and the same is said<br>for whether it's rice whether it's soy<br>whether it's coin uh corn uh they all<br>got a very very big uh energy component<br>fertilizer pesticides<br>insecticides the processing facilities<br>that convert it from from bushels to to<br>liquid uh and the distribution system<br>moving trucks and tankers from A to B it<br>it or pipe lines whatever it is it all<br>consumes energy and so when you look at<br>all of that in total about 60% of the of<br>the food uh cost of food is the cost of<br>energy so what you're really seeing here<br>is is that food is a is a is a magnifier<br>of the effects of high energy and and<br>you know that to be true in your<br>supermarkets you know that be to be true<br>you know when in 2005 when in New<br>Zealand when you know fuel was a dollar<br>a liter uh you know you had your you had<br>your your power bills and your utility<br>bills you had your food bills from your<br>Supermarket you look today you got your<br>food is is nearly twice what it cost in<br>2005 oil is now twice what it cost your<br>power bills is twice what it was do you<br>think there's a correlation between any<br>of these and so you know fundamentally<br>uh food has the effect of amplifying uh<br>the effects of<br>energy and the reason this is important<br>is that it affects different people in<br>different ways so this is a plot again<br>from David archbold's uh uh presentation<br>in in<br>Australia this this graph is is a is a<br>representation of um how much of your<br>GDP per capita is spent on food and so<br>for each country we have a a percentage<br>of food so it's pretty noisy slide but<br>you can see that in the lighter colors<br>these two colors in here uh not to 10%<br>and 10% to 20% in the oecd world we just<br>arbitrarily cut off at 20% so if the<br>price of food per capita is less than<br>20% of your per capita income you would<br>consider yourself to be in in the oecd<br>world and so you know so North America I<br>think is the lowest at 6.9% of GDP is<br>spent on food a little bit more<br>expensive in Canada the UK is whatever<br>it is I can't read that is8 8 point<br>something and uh New Zealand's running<br>at 12 something per there so you know<br>there's that there's a correlation there<br>and what this says is that if you look<br>at the Middle East uh many of these<br>countries here you're running nearly<br>half the per capita GDP is spent on food<br>half of the income is spent to survive<br>it's not that surprising that the Arab<br>Spring occurred it's not that surprising<br>people are so in in in such a tight spot<br>they've got nothing to lose by creating<br>Anarchy from from the regime that's<br>there in place at the moment anything<br>would be better so they think anything<br>would be better than what they had until<br>it happens and then the current is way<br>worse than what it was but that's that's<br>a process that you know so you've got to<br>you end up with a social upheaval when<br>when the price of food is is<br>considerably higher than than say 20% of<br>your GDP per<br>capita so how this plays out is that in<br>in different countries uh everyone's<br>going to feel the pain in different ways<br>so in a high high energy so this is this<br>is a graph that that represents the<br>income per capita relative to the US per<br>capita so the US is obviously 100% so in<br>the oecd world we typically have about<br>you know up to you know down as low as<br>70% of incomes across Europe you know<br>Japan New Zealand somewhere and here<br>between 70% and 100% of the per capita<br>income is is uh represents the oecd<br>world over the last 40 years from 1969<br>through to<br>today the rest of the world with a few<br>exceptions sit down here at n to 20% and<br>you can see China here you up until 1999<br>was only a couple of percent of GDP it's<br>now climbed to a staggering sort of 8%<br>so it's had a big big economic growth<br>but man it's a long way to go and so you<br>can see that there are kind of Two<br>Worlds here you've got the world where<br>you've got the effects of high energy<br>that impacts Food Supplies that impact<br>ta uh you know where where the the<br>earning capacity of the economies are<br>far far more constrained or far lower<br>than than this this you know it's almost<br>like you've got a have world and a have<br>not World almost you know you got this<br>and that's that's getting magnified with<br>time not it's not closing with time and<br>it's not to do with being good neighbors<br>and good citizens it's just I don't know<br>it's just just the way it is it's you<br>know we're pretty lucky to be in this<br>country country I'd have to say so but<br>what this represents is risk and so as<br>the price of energy keeps on<br>Rising how does this play out and and do<br>you want to put your investments into<br>these sorts of countries or do you want<br>to put your investments into these sorts<br>of countries if you're going to be<br>making a 20-year bet where you going to<br>put your money and how do you factor in<br>the risks that might arise from social<br>upheaval associated with uh you know the<br>masses uh not getting a you know getting<br>access to you know lowcost food and a<br>lot of those economies uh which by the<br>way there's there's a number of OPAC<br>countries that Survive by virtue of<br>their their um subsidy on food and<br>energy that keeps their agms in<br>place so<br>um so what I so the the takeaways on<br>Supply the first thing is that uh OPEC<br>dominates so we talked about the Shell<br>gas phenomen that's occurring in North<br>America unlikely to be replicated<br>elsewhere maybe maybe that's maybe<br>that's true maybe that's not but we<br>think it's not going to be replicated<br>anytime soon and so what's opec's<br>response going to be so if you look at<br>opec's previous history and in recent<br>history you've got to think that they're<br>likely to back off the throttle a little<br>bit to keep the price of oil High why<br>would they be interested in doing that<br>so Saudi Arabia has 28 million people<br>today and and generates 10 million<br>barrels a day of exports for o of oil<br>it's got a very very rapid population<br>growth along with many of the OPEC<br>countries and so by 2030 they're going<br>to have another quarter again population<br>and they'll be in a position not even to<br>be exporting 5 or six million barrels of<br>oil by then and the rest of it will be<br>required for domestic consumption so<br>they require by 2030 and I'm just using<br>S as an example they'll require over<br>$300 a barrel of oil to balance their<br>books why is that important well the<br>regime needs to balance its books in<br>order to keep the subsidies in place for<br>for its population which is growing like<br>crazy and the subsidies come in the form<br>of two two forms one is energy subsidy<br>and the second one is food subsidy so<br>they need to keep the subsidies going<br>and they need to keep their their<br>regimes legitimized by virtue of a high<br>Revenue stream so they got a very strong<br>incentive and you can plot every<br>individual company country uh within<br>OPEC against what its Break Even point<br>is with with oil I've just used Saudi<br>Arabia as one example but it's probably<br>at the lower end of the spectrum there<br>are plenty of other countries like<br>Venezuela and Iran that require far<br>greater levels of return to sustain<br>their regimes or sustain the status quo<br>it's not to say the status quo won't<br>change but that's what's going through<br>their minds they need to keep that<br>Revenue going in order to sustain their<br>position so you know clearly the Shale<br>is in the US is going to continue to to<br>boom that's that's pretty obvious uh at<br>the stage that may have some sort of<br>moderating effect on the price of oil so<br>Saudi might want to jack up the price of<br>oil fairly quickly uh that might be<br>moderated so how it plays out is is<br>going to be a a tug of- war between you<br>know how what's the psychology of and<br>and uh you know the position of OPC<br>versus the position of the US and and<br>that's going to I don't know how that's<br>going to play out<br>exactly uh coal and gas consumption will<br>continue to grow those Peaks have yet to<br>be achieved on on both those two fossil<br>fuels over the next 20<br>years and clearly you know there are<br>disruptive innovators that might you<br>know bite us so methane hydrates the<br>Japanese have been looking at meth<br>hydrates for forever and haven't found a<br>commercial way of extracting methane gas<br>from liquid Crystal uh hydrates at the<br>bottom of the sea or just below the sea<br>bed so that would be quite a challenge<br>how to get it out but the world's got a<br>lot of methane hydrates floating around<br>so you know uh so that's that's one<br>disruptive innovator that might occur<br>the other one might be thorium<br>technology so the US developed thorium<br>reactors this is molten salt it's a bit<br>like nuclear energy but it it uses<br>thorium instead of uranium and uh far<br>safer uh but there are materials of<br>construction and and uh containment that<br>are pretty tricky challenges but the US<br>did uh develop some degree of of you<br>know piloti of of that uh technology the<br>chines have bought that technology and<br>and now spending billions a year on<br>trying to commercialize that for elves<br>they'd like to prototype that worldwide<br>and become a leader in that space would<br>that disrupt all this maybe maybe not<br>who knows um you know there there are<br>you know uh you know renewable fuels you<br>know what happens with renewable fuels<br>do you think they they're going to take<br>off and and are they going to are they<br>going to displace crude oil not anytime<br>soon but uh in our view but uh you know<br>the disrupt the the disruptors you know<br>need they need a Level Playing Field in<br>terms of it's got to commercially or<br>economically make sense and pretty much<br>all of your renewable fuels doesn't<br>matter where you are on the planet they<br>don't really make sense unless you<br>subsidize them someone's got to pay so<br>it's either taxpayers or or mandates<br>which is really taxpayers or the<br>motorist someone has to sort of uh<br>balance the box and if you don't balance<br>a box and just let the market decide<br>you'll have no Renewables virtually no<br>Renewables so it's it is a challenge and<br>and as the price of oil goes up the cost<br>of Ren Renewables goes up because<br>Renewables is largely some sort of food<br>so the index that I talked about at the<br>60% on oil to food correlates also to<br>Renewables so as the price of oil goes<br>up it's not that surprising the price of<br>cost of Renewables also goes up but the<br>the oil might go up at a far steeper<br>rate than the than than Renewables so<br>some point they should intersect but at<br>the point that they intersect might be<br>at a point where<br>there's a demand<br>response and I think the demand response<br>is going to beat the Renewables response<br>because I think the demand response is<br>is going to come down to first of all<br>how much can can Nations actually afford<br>to pay for oil and and seven out of<br>eight of the<br>last um uh eight of the global<br>recessions that have occurred in the<br>last 50 years have been preceded by<br>spikes in the price of oil it's not that<br>it's not that it's not rocket science<br>really so you know that that as as a as<br>the price of oil goes up worldwide<br>you're going to be followed by a<br>recession you know 7 out of eight is not<br>a bad<br>correlation so clearly you and there's<br>obviously an amplifier effect on food uh<br>and what happens to GDP consumption<br>patterns so if you look go back to two<br>you know from 2005 to 2013 and look<br>around you and look at what's happened<br>with retailing New Zealand just just in<br>our own backyard you'll see that retail<br>patterns have shifted you know more<br>interet internet online uh consumption<br>uh there's been a shift away from<br>consumables to<br>durables um similar to what our parents<br>might have had you know back in you know<br>the the days during following World War<br>II um where we've been very wasteful<br>since I'd have to say uh but clearly you<br>know you're going to end up with a trend<br>back towards<br>durables now you know again with a<br>rising energy price what happens is that<br>um you get a loss in disposable income a<br>loss in disposable because a lot of that<br>income is going into the energy systems<br>that support you so so uh that that that<br>means that there's less economic<br>activity that means that there's less<br>taxation collection by government it<br>means that government's going to debt<br>and what's happened in the in the oecd<br>world pretty much every country in the<br>world in the oecd world anyway has gone<br>into debt in the last since<br>2008 why because of this it's all it's<br>all linked to to what's going on with in<br>my view I'm I'm probably very biased on<br>this but in my view I think it it links<br>back to energy it's not the only link<br>but it's it's a core link and I think at<br>the end of the day uh who adapts quickly<br>and how is is really the question that<br>we need to be asking ourselves we will<br>all adapt whether we like it or not it's<br>just a question of whether it's whether<br>it's um um whether it's uh you know fast<br>and painful or whether it's sudden and<br>brutal but either way it's going to<br>affect everyone so higher oil price<br>means that we have to adapt the question<br>is for an economy how do you collect all<br>of the and bring all of the population<br>with you so that you don't make it<br>someone's you know it's the oil<br>company's fault or it's the it's the<br>utility oh I know what it is uh the<br>electricity Market's not working Ah<br>that's what it is let's regulate it you<br>know that's not going to solve anything<br>at the end of the day you know you're<br>pointing these these blind fingers<br>trying to assume that that's what the<br>problem is the problem is very very<br>fundamental and it means what it this<br>means is that you actually have to<br>figure out how the economy is consumes<br>less energy to do what it enjoys doing<br>that's the that's the fundamental trick<br>when it comes to the demand side what<br>are the innovators well you know<br>you know I think Oakland University's<br>got some uh you know smart people that<br>are figuring some of the stuff out but<br>you know the nanotechnology you know<br>you've got graphine that might replace<br>aluminum or replace uh steel and in<br>construction of vehicles um who knows I<br>mean there's there's there's all sorts<br>of uh things that might occur in terms<br>of innovation<br>um uh in in demand space but you know<br>lots of lots of smart uh ways of uh of<br>so methanex what are we doing um so you<br>know we're we're a little old uh Global<br>methanol company that's all we we do we<br>focus on methanol we don't focus on<br>anything else and yet we've got our<br>fingers in a lot of different pies so<br>we're working with a with some Partners<br>in Iceland that's making uh renewable<br>methanol from geothermal waste<br>CO2 so you convert the waste CO2 into<br>into ethol by capturing CO2 from the<br>atmosphere mixing with hydrogen mix the<br>two together when I say mix it's kind of<br>a chemical reaction so you mix the two<br>together to produce methanol that<br>renewable methanol goes into the<br>gasoline system in Europe today so that<br>that's that's the top leftand Corner<br>doesn't make economic sense not really<br>someone has to pay so the European Union<br>is is paying these great subsidies and<br>you know anyway so but what we're doing<br>in the meantime is we're learning a lot<br>about the space you know what are the<br>economics how do they work you know can<br>you refine it can you innovate better<br>ways of making that<br>work uh in New<br>Zealand where's my little pointer here<br>so this is our monoi plant just north of<br>New Plymouth and then in the background<br>you've got the white Trav valy plant so<br>uh they were mothballed back in 2003 uh<br>we were on our last legs in fact my my<br>uh my uh orders at the time were to you<br>know have an orderly shutdown in New<br>Zealand shift the assets offshore and uh<br>wind everything up so I didn't quite<br>follow instructions so we've now got uh<br>the monoi plant running at at full<br>capacity uh we're spending about $250<br>million of capital this year to uh<br>refurbish one of the plants here and<br>start up the second or third unit over<br>there so between those three plants they<br>make up 5% of the world's methanol<br>Supply as that comes on coal-based<br>methanol and that's produced in China<br>comes off so we've got a pretty<br>competitive advantage in New Zealand uh<br>it's a great sovereign country to be<br>investing in very low risk if you go<br>back to some of the earlier slides you<br>can see why I'm very excited about New<br>Zealand so in that context you know you<br>might have complaints about you know the<br>resource management Act is inefficient<br>and blah blah blah H that's that's<br>trivial really and the scheme of things<br>New Zealand's actually a fantastic place<br>to<br>invest uh down here on the uh bottom<br>right left hand side you can see these<br>big pre- assemblies uh we're shifting 2<br>to 3,000 ton pre assemblies as we speak<br>uh we're shifting two methanol plants uh<br>these are these are big plants these<br>will be the some of the biggest<br>relocation kit in the world uh we're<br>shifting two of these plants at a cost<br>of about 1.1 billion to the US to<br>Louisiana putting them up the<br>Mississippi River we'll unload them over<br>the levy and onto the site uh and we're<br>going to be taking advantage of that<br>show gas over the next couple of decades<br>so that's very exciting we can do it<br>faster and cheaper than anyone else can<br>do it why because we've got a couple of<br>methanol plants that are sitting there<br>not not uh running at the moment we've<br>got four plants that are not running<br>right now uh so we're shifting two of<br>them and we're deciding on the other two<br>uh we've got a little picture in here<br>there a picture of a ship uh we've got a<br>uh we've got Partners in Scandinavia<br>that we're working with uh company's<br>called Stenner but one of uh a whole<br>bunch of companies along with a swed<br>government and we're looking to convert<br>uh ships in Europe in 2016 the European<br>standards for for atmospheric pollution<br>from ships in the Baltic and North Sea<br>is going to get tighter and so they're<br>going to have much much tighter uh<br>emissions standards for particulates<br>sulfur and and and nox nitrogen oxides<br>and so those standards can be met by<br>either very very ultra low sulfur marine<br>diesel oil which means that the<br>refineries have to upgrade their<br>refineries to to remove Trace sulfur<br>from the desert oil or they can run the<br>ships on methanol so what we're doing at<br>the moment is is uh running some uh<br>trials running a ship on on uh methanol<br>to replace uh so you don't run on<br>bunkers in that part of the world you<br>run on marine diesel oil you shut down<br>your Marine Diesel run on methanol so<br>methanol is effectively substituting<br>diesel so another diesel substitution<br>and then in Australia we've got a a uh a<br>vehicle testing program just out of<br>Melbourne place called jalong it's the<br>Ford testing facility uh and we're<br>testing a range of uh Ford Focus<br>commodor uh Holden commodor uh and<br>Toyota Camry's and and Falcons and XR<br>sixes or eights or something so we've<br>got about uh we've got a a range of<br>vehicles that have being tested on a mix<br>of gasline ethanol or methanol so all<br>the way up to uh I think it's 85%<br>ethanol and 56% methanol uh so different<br>mixtures different cocktails and what<br>we're doing there is demonstrating the<br>efficacy of alcohol fuels and transport<br>that's what we're trying to do and once<br>we've proved it's been done for the last<br>15 years in China China's now<br>manufacturing 60,000 Vehicles a year on<br>pure methanol<br>engines so biggest car market in the<br>world today is China growing at just<br>under 20 million Vehicles new vehicles a<br>year<br>the US is about 15 million Vehicles a<br>year so the China is where it's all<br>happening and all your big vehicle<br>Manufacturing in the next two decades<br>it's going to be in China so you know<br>it's not surprising that gad's upset in<br>in Australia with the closure of forward<br>um anyway it's that's going to happen in<br>China they've got the scale they've got<br>the uh capability that's on a on a on a<br>scale that the rest of the world hasn't<br>seen other than perhaps the US in terms<br>of GM and for there so you've got these<br>this this very exciting testing program<br>that's underway there we'd like to be<br>able to import that testing program or<br>the results of that into New Zealand<br>into the New Zealand context uh and and<br>leverage there so these are just some of<br>of the examples that you know here we<br>are methanex producing methanol and<br>we've got our fingers and all sorts of<br>different pies uh uh indirectly related<br>to to our<br>industry so I'll just leave on a on a<br>slide that uh provides a few insights<br>into the New Zealand economy uh you know<br>what what could New Zealand do to<br>position itself I would start off by<br>just saying that there's a lot of things<br>that we're doing<br>already that has being done really well<br>so the government's actually embarked on<br>a program of of of improving the way<br>acreage is is allocated in New Zealand<br>this is exploration acreage for for<br>accessing oil and gas<br>reserves and so they they've gone<br>through and streamlined that process<br>some could argue that it's a step<br>backwards I would say it's a step<br>forwards because it it means that<br>players that can participate in that<br>have got to have reasonably Deep Pockets<br>to and and you and it weeds out some of<br>the players that have got way way less<br>capability and it's got to be good for<br>New Zealand in terms of standards of of<br>uh<br>performance the second element obviously<br>of that is is good environmental<br>regulation and I I think I mean my<br>belief is that we've got a you know a<br>pretty good balance you know is it<br>perfect does it satisfy everyone you<br>know you're never going to satisfy<br>everyone but I think I think they've<br>struck a pretty good balance so the<br>government has you know through uh the<br>ministry of business Innovation and<br>employment uh it's a bit of a mouthful<br>it replaces Meed it's it's uh but anyway<br>so that uh that organization or that arm<br>of uh government has completed the<br>process of of rationalizing the uh<br>permitting process and adopting the<br>process of adopting pretty tough<br>environmental standards so now they're<br>in the process of going out and<br>promoting New Zealand as a destination<br>for oil and gas explorers<br>worldwide so I think we watch the space<br>I think uh I think that's you know<br>they're doing really well there I think<br>that's a tick there the next one is<br>creating an endowment fund for all new<br>new oil and gas royalties this is a<br>challenge so do you do you fund the hip<br>operation today or do you fund a child's<br>education for 20 years away and it's the<br>Dilemma that all governments have idea<br>you know in an Ideal World which is what<br>Norway had they ended up striking a<br>bipartisan agreement between the left<br>and right of parliament 40 years ago and<br>it's somehow<br>stuck and it would be good for New<br>Zealand to to have a a bipartisan<br>agreement between both sides of<br>parliament uh a bit like the<br>superannuation Accord that never<br>occurred but you know could you actually<br>have some sort of uh agreement a cross<br>party agreement that takes us off the<br>political agenda and says you know<br>shouldn't we be putting some of the<br>money that we earn from these fossil<br>fuels into a into a fund that's<br>intergenerational because what we're<br>really doing at the moment is using all<br>of the spoils that we create on the<br>current generation and who you know<br>what's for the next so so and what<br>Norway's done is it's gone from being<br>one of the poorest countries in Europe<br>to one of the wealthiest nations in the<br>world and one of the things that clearly<br>they got a lot of oil and gas from the<br>North Sea but fundamentally what they've<br>done is created an endowment fund which<br>makes it the second biggest endowment<br>fund after<br>Dubai and you know if New Zealand had a<br>big oil and gas reserve you'd think<br>wouldn't it be a neat idea to put a<br>chunk of that money aside for future<br>Generations so that's kind of that's<br>what we think anyway uh the the third<br>item is opening up transport to<br>competing liquid<br>fuels you know I think the the shest way<br>to to sort out OPEC is is competition<br>how do you create competition you have<br>you create competition and transport<br>fuel right now and the oil dilemma in<br>the world today is a transport issue<br>it's not a power issue as in electricity<br>you can make electricity from Renewables<br>nuclear coal fossil fuels you name it<br>you can make it from it doesn't matter<br>what source where it comes from as long<br>as it gets into the grid you know<br>consumer doesn't really care but a car<br>car runs on petrol and Diesel everywhere<br>in the world it doesn't run on anything<br>else so while we keep focused on our<br>cars running on only those products<br>we're beholden to<br>OPEC so clearly New Zealand is not going<br>to lead the way in in opening up the<br>fuel standard and making us uh<br>completely alcohol compatible that feels<br>like a step too far for New Zealand it'<br>be good if we did it but I don't think<br>we'll do it but we should be a fast<br>follower<br>now fast follower so so here we have<br>Israel that's just you know just<br>mandated 15% alcohols and and fuels for<br>the for the nation they want to wean<br>themselves off uh off oil uh and plenty<br>of other smaller countries around the<br>world are following suit uh so you know<br>the the the country that's that's by far<br>streets ahead of anyone else in the<br>world today is China and they don't have<br>I should I should use my words carefully<br>here but they<br>they have a group of people um that uh<br>are technocrats you know they professors<br>and and and economists and what have you<br>they you know Basel you know economists<br>so so they they've got these group of<br>smart people that figure out what's best<br>for China and they're not beholden to<br>Pork barel politics or anything else<br>they just figure out what's best and<br>then they get on and do it and the rest<br>of the world argues because of all the<br>stuff that goes on in democracies which<br>is fine but it's very it makes it a bit<br>slow for us so here we are you know<br>China's tuning out you know it's it's<br>got this alcohol regime or methanol<br>regime in China it's the fastest growing<br>alcohol Market in in the world uh and<br>they're now even producing cars to to<br>run on the stuff on a dedicated basis<br>and what they're up to is trying to wean<br>themselves off opic that's what they're<br>up<br>to and and the rest of the world should<br>be taking note and doing the same sort<br>of thing now New Zealand do make cars we<br>obviously import our cars so we can only<br>go at the pace at which some of the<br>super economies can go at but we should<br>be pretty fast behind not not a lagard<br>and I think this is part of our<br>competitive advantage to to if we can<br>keep in there as a as a fast follower um<br>you know I think that's that's really to<br>the benefit of of new<br>zealanders continuing to promote Energy<br>Efficiency e could do a fabulous job you<br>know they the the insulation and homes<br>program is brilliant<br>um you know should be you ramped up and<br>and continue to make new Zeal New<br>Zealand homes are pretty damn cold so<br>you know anything that improves Energy<br>Efficiency is a good thing uh and last<br>but not least is investing in<br>sustainable public transport we all talk<br>about electric trains and electric uh<br>this that and the other thing and uh<br>until someone sees the capital cost of<br>doing these things and the capital cost<br>is is phenomenally huge and<br>uh but it's a case of inter<br>internalization of cost versus<br>externalization of cost so while we sit<br>on the motorway and it takes you know an<br>hour to travel 6 km and we're competing<br>with every other man his and his uh dog<br>on the<br>road uh you know someone's paying for<br>that and if you could take into account<br>the effect of of loss of congestion and<br>factored the value of that into the<br>economy or facted that into the<br>economics of mass<br>transport and I'm not advocating let's<br>do it all tomorrow but we should be<br>chipping away at this thing year after<br>year after year extending the<br>electrification extending it extending<br>it extending it I'm a bit of a fan of<br>electric trolley buses like we have in<br>Wellington uh I don't know what it would<br>cost to string up those lines to to run<br>them down the main you know like great<br>South Road and and uh new North Road and<br>you know some of the main areas where<br>the corridors where the buses typically<br>run and and just run them on trolley<br>buses I mean trolley buses have been<br>around for 50 60 years 70 years so<br>pretty low Tech but man I'm very<br>effective I don't know what the<br>economics of that is but it seems very<br>sensible to me so you know we've got to<br>keep investing in in U sustainable<br>public transport uh I'm a I'm a I think<br>well first of all I don't think there's<br>any Silver Bullet te of this it's going<br>to be a lot of lot of activities Each of<br>which will make some difference uh<br>you're not going to be if you're looking<br>for some sort of Nana in the space<br>you're not going to find it you're going<br>to be<br>disappointed um my view is that the the<br>um uh I think that the Battery<br>Technology is is is a long long way away<br>from from Mass deployment and transport<br>batteries are expensive batteries are<br>heavy uh and they don't give you very<br>many miles per gallon or or very many<br>miles of on a on a on a battery<br>charge so you need to store energy some<br>other way and if you want to get away<br>from Petrol I think the most economic<br>way to do that from a very objective<br>standpoint is is using<br>methanol so you use methanol you have an<br>alcohol uh fueled you have an alcohol<br>engine uh the alcohol engines are very<br>light they got no water system on them<br>very high compression very high<br>efficiency and you only run them to<br>charge the battery so you have a small<br>battery you have a hybrid plugin hybrid<br>alcohol<br>engine whether it makes economic sense<br>you know you know time will tell um but<br>you know clearly it's a way it's a<br>lowcost way of of extending the battery<br>so if you're traveling around the city<br>and doing small distances you can just<br>use the battery and use the grid to<br>charge up if you want to go for a long<br>distance uh how do you charge up you<br>know so you need something to carry you<br>that that extra distance and if it's not<br>petrol what else would it would it be so<br>it could be methanol could be ethanol<br>ethanol is quite expensive to make<br>because it's a fermentation process it's<br>slow methanol is a is is an industrial<br>gasification step or or you know<br>chemical reaction that's that's a<br>thousand times faster so so there are<br>inherent fundamental reasons why<br>methanol makes economic<br>sense so I think I think that was uh I<br>just want to acknowledge these<br>individuals and these organizations uh<br>nothing that I've said is actually very<br>unique uh it's just a collection of<br>ideas from other smart people around the<br>world and open to questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
