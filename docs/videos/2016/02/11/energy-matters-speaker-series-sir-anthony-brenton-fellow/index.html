and natural gas, has played in global politics in recent decades.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you thank you very much puzzle I<br>am audible am I I I must say I'm a New<br>Zealand ur by this scent so it's great<br>pleasure for me to be here I'm<br>astonished that 150 or so people are<br>here rather than on the beach and let me<br>tell you a nice story about New Zealand<br>which happened to me a couple of days<br>ago actually which some of you already<br>heard I came over to the business school<br>for breakfast last week and it was a<br>crack of dawn well I'm staying in<br>devonport with my mother crack of dawn<br>when I rushed down to the ferry terminal<br>to get on the boat and I got on the boat<br>and went down to buy my ticket as we<br>sailed off from the pier and they said<br>sorry sir this bug did go into waikiki<br>and i thought oh dear i'm going to miss<br>my breakfast but they turned around and<br>took me back they didn't quite say we<br>get idiots like you all the time but<br>this can be the only country in the<br>world where they treat you us like that<br>and it's great to be here I am I have<br>however spent most of my career as a<br>British diplomat and one of my favorite<br>definitions of a diplomat is a man who<br>thinks twice before saying nothing so<br>I'm rather hoping to disabuse you of<br>that impression of at least this British<br>diplomat this evening and what you're<br>going to get is effectively a very rapid<br>tour through my career and the energy<br>implications of it and let me just give<br>you the highlights of that tour in<br>summary first I started my career in<br>Egypt in the Middle East they taught me<br>Arabic and I was there over the time<br>thats adapt made peace with Israel and<br>then was killed but being in that part<br>of the world at that time you could not<br>but be conscious of how important it is<br>in energy terms and how deeply unstable<br>and unpredictable the politics there are<br>and those two facts of course interact<br>like it individuated times of that I<br>then went back to London and eventually<br>Brussels and worked in the european<br>commission on environmental issues and i<br>find myself envy engaged in the first<br>round of global negotiations about<br>global climate change which is obviously<br>a subject intimately related to our<br>energy policies<br>and I'm going to devote a little bit of<br>time to that probably most frustrating<br>negotiations I have ever taken part in<br>but it was really good for my bridge and<br>then thirdly towards the end of my<br>career they sent me off to Russia I<br>don't know if I'd misbehaved at some<br>stage but they taught me Russian Russia<br>was changing dramatically and Russia was<br>in particular at that time turning into<br>what they themselves describe as an<br>energy superpower Russia is currently<br>the world's largest producer of oil and<br>largest producer of gas and I'm going to<br>say a few words about that but before I<br>get on to the particular particular<br>chapters of my talk let me start off<br>with my title a world in flux why is the<br>energy world today different and the<br>answer is there's a graph of crude oil<br>prices over the last god knows one<br>hundred and something years and it comes<br>in sort of three phases look at the red<br>line which is real prices around the<br>blue line which is nominal prices for a<br>long time they remain pretty stable at<br>about 15 or so dollars a barrel you then<br>hit the oil shock of the beginning of<br>the 70s and they go up to about 30 or so<br>dollars a barrel and we lived with that<br>for another 20 years or so and then<br>recently within the last 10 years we've<br>had a second in effect oil shock and<br>they've shot up to order of magnitude<br>ninety dollars a barrel we're in a world<br>today of expensive oil in historic terms<br>and that is why the world is in flux<br>we're still adapting to that fact and<br>our global politics are also adapting to<br>that fact now why have the price has<br>gone up at a time actually when the<br>world economy is a bit of a mess when<br>oil demand is down in lots of places the<br>answer is that while demand in developed<br>countries like New Zealand and more<br>bigger in economic terms the United<br>States in the UK is pretty flat the<br>non-oecd notably China India Brazil is<br>taking off that's where all the extra<br>demand is coming from so when you read<br>newspaper stories saying the u.s. is in<br>recession all price is going to go down<br>don't believe it the real driver of<br>prices today if you have to identify one<br>place is China that's a very crucial<br>shift in the balance of forces<br>in global energy markets and it's a<br>shift that unless China implodes which<br>is not impossible but is unlikely is<br>going to go on for the foreseeable<br>future and the other thing that you tend<br>to read in the newspapers is any case<br>oil gas they're yesterday's story Cole<br>they yesterday's story it's renewable to<br>the coming along it's wind it's all of<br>that this also you should treat with a<br>certain amount of portion that is the<br>current breakdown of global energy<br>consumption and if you look at the three<br>big big chunks of the circle it's all<br>oil coal and natural gas the rest up<br>there in the corner is all the rest<br>including nuclear hydro all the rest and<br>if you read things like the BP you've<br>recently produced a 30-year energy<br>forecast that's roughly how it's going<br>to stay over the next quarter of a<br>century there'll be a slight expansion<br>in renewables but frankly we are stuck<br>with all of these tedious and troubling<br>old energy sources for certainly the<br>rest of my life and for quite a lot of<br>your lives out there so that's the<br>energy picture there is one big<br>uncertainty which I must mention now<br>both about the price prospects and about<br>the shape of demand and that is<br>something which has happened really very<br>dramatically in the United States in the<br>last decade or so which has been the<br>emergence of what's called shale gas and<br>also shale oil this is gas and<br>eventually oil produced by<br>unconventional techniques oil men who<br>don't like big words call it fracking<br>it's hydraulic fracturing and the effect<br>is that the United States which was a<br>region of steadily declining oil and gas<br>production suddenly it has a vast new<br>source of gas and eventually of oil and<br>this is a development which is pregnant<br>with quite serious political potential<br>consequences shale gas has moved in the<br>US from one presenter production in the<br>year two thousand to about twenty<br>percent now projected to be forty six<br>percent nearly half by 2035 there<br>already gassed self-sufficient so lots<br>of countries in the Gulf and elsewhere<br>that planned to export their gas the<br>United States now arms and they look<br>for other markets for their gas and<br>indeed in the United States itself coal<br>producers are exporting their coal to<br>Europe and elsewhere because it can no<br>longer compete with gas prices this is a<br>very serious potential change you will<br>read about it in hyperbolic terms in the<br>energy and the business press half<br>believe it certainly there's been a huge<br>change in the United States certainly<br>that may carry big further changes<br>elsewhere these are estimated shale gas<br>deposits around the world very big in<br>China therefore potentially very<br>important quite big in Europe but when<br>you read any of this stuff you have to<br>aim off a little bit for the hype nobody<br>really knows how much of this stuff is<br>generally extractable nobody really<br>knows outside the United States how much<br>of it is going to be blocked by<br>environmental and other concerns nobody<br>really knows how good the estimates are<br>the story from Poland is actually rather<br>a compelling one when first the polls<br>identified their shell gas deposits<br>which this was a great way of getting<br>out from under the Russians for whom<br>they buy all their gas at the moment<br>they were estimated about 110 trillion<br>cubic feet which is vast then a year<br>later someone did a rest emit and cut<br>that number by ninety percent the<br>numbers are still all over the place so<br>I'd be a little bit cautious about<br>seeing a total revolution yet but<br>there's certainly the potential for a<br>revolution out there and that will be<br>one of the shadows hanging over the<br>reliability of everything i say to you<br>from now on okay i'm going to start bout<br>now my tour around the world i'm going<br>to start with Russia I know Russia is a<br>long long way from New Zealand but I'm<br>slightly obsessed with the place and<br>Russia exemplifies in all sorts of<br>splendid ways issues in the global<br>energy politics which are then<br>reproduced very much in other places now<br>I want to go back to my price car at<br>graph and the reason I want to go back<br>is to underline how important energy is<br>in Russia what this graph is is apart<br>from a graph of global oil prices it's a<br>graph of Russian history over the last<br>30 years if you look at what happens<br>here you look at the collapse<br>after 19 at the beginning of the 1980s<br>what you're looking at apart from<br>anything else is the fall of communism<br>you're looking at a government that runs<br>out of oil revenues has to reform its<br>system in order to make itself<br>economically competence in other ways<br>and therefore destroys itself you then<br>look at the Yeltsin period not a great<br>period in Russian history no money total<br>internal collapse you look in particular<br>this deep dip you look at the moment<br>when Russia went through four prime<br>ministers in a year when Yeltsin finally<br>faded out when the country hit absolute<br>bottom and as you look at the recovery I<br>like to think not because of him but in<br>cutting in his company you look at the<br>arrival of Vladimir Putin and you look<br>at a man who however awful the press he<br>may get here and elsewhere in Europe in<br>the United States is extremely popular<br>with the Russian people because he was<br>there at the time the price went up<br>again and he was therefore able to dish<br>out lots of goodies to his people and<br>even despite all of the stuff they've<br>had recently the demonstrations and all<br>of that who remains a very very popular<br>president of russia the first point<br>about russia an important concept as you<br>look at politics and energy is the<br>concept of the oil curse which is<br>governments which have vast amounts of<br>oil or rent ranchi a economy a funds of<br>one sort in another and therefore don't<br>have to worry very much about popular<br>opinion because they are not dependent<br>on taxes Russia is a splendid example of<br>the oil curse we have an authoritarian<br>on the whole rather incompetent<br>government which nevertheless remain<br>solidly in place because of this great<br>influx of oil revenues and the oil curse<br>we will come back to when we get to the<br>Middle East the other important fact<br>about Russia is that of course if you've<br>got all these or revenues coming in you<br>want to keep your people happy you dish<br>it out in terms of extra social spending<br>of one sort of mother which Russia has<br>exactly done that and the consequences<br>that the break-even price for oil for<br>such a country the price below which you<br>cannot let the oil fall because you<br>haven't got enough money for a real<br>social spending in the case of Russia is<br>now of the order of 100 120 dollars a<br>barrel<br>Russia cannot allow the price of oil has<br>enough control over it to fall below<br>that value and we'll come back to the<br>issue of the break-even price for oil<br>for other major producers in a minute<br>but the main point I want to make about<br>Russia is that with all these oil<br>resources they have been eight they have<br>been able to become and immensely<br>troublesome component on the world scene<br>first time i was there 1994 to 1998 with<br>the Yeltsin period the period of the<br>bottom of the graph they were dependent<br>on the West for support for finance for<br>all of that they therefore kept quiet<br>even when we did things they really<br>hated by the kosovo evasion like the<br>expansion of NATO when I went back there<br>as ambassador 2004 to 2008 they had the<br>money and they were suddenly very<br>self-confident indeed and we had a whole<br>string of massive problems and you will<br>no doubt recall the Georgia war I<br>vividly recall in effect the forceful<br>takeover of two major British energy<br>exercises going on in Russia saqlain to<br>which is a big gas project on the sacral<br>in ireland in the east and tnk-bp which<br>is a very big BP investment they're all<br>sorts of hideous things happened and<br>because not only do they have all these<br>are these at these assets but also their<br>exports go very largely to europe about<br>twenty-five percent of Europe's gas<br>production and thirty percent of<br>Europe's oil consumption come from<br>Russia other European countries are very<br>cautious about alienating them so I<br>don't know the name Litvinenko means<br>anything to you this was a Russian<br>citizen actually British citizen at that<br>time poisoned in London with polonium in<br>a very unpleasant way I had the<br>misfortune to be british ambassador in<br>moscow at the time this was described as<br>the low point in anglo-russian relations<br>since the end of the Cold War one of the<br>things we did in order to register with<br>the Russians that it really wasn't the<br>way you behaved was we went to our EU<br>partners and said come on join up with<br>us and let's put in a complaint and they<br>didn't and the reason that they didn't<br>is because their dependence on Russian<br>oil and gas made them very wary about<br>provoking the bear so having oil having<br>gas gives you international clout I want<br>to talk briefly about two other<br>geopolitical factors flowing from<br>Russia's changing situation 1 i'm going<br>to very quick about the<br>but it is fascinating is the Arctic and<br>this is also related to climate change<br>of course even as we speak the Arctic<br>sea ice is steadily melting there is a<br>graph of the extent of Arctic sea ice<br>over the last 20 years and you see it is<br>it is steadily diminishing this is<br>opening up the Arctic first of all for<br>Navigation routes which people died to<br>try and find their way around in the<br>eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the<br>Northwest Passage in the Northeast<br>Passage and now opening up more and more<br>for super tankers first what no super<br>tankers went around the north of Russia<br>three years ago two years ago for went<br>round last year 50 went round a whole<br>new transport route is opening up up<br>there of immense advantage to the<br>Russians but what is also opening up is<br>a vast oil and gas province that's a map<br>of the oil and gas resources in the<br>Arctic there's a lot of them they're<br>scattered around and sadly there are<br>some contention about where the borders<br>lie that's a map of you can see the<br>Russian claim up there in the north<br>there are various disputed areas there<br>are some rules it's very easy to decide<br>who has what inside territorial waters<br>but there is a big argument impending<br>about where territorial waters extend to<br>and I want to introduce you to a friend<br>of mine at this point this is our tour<br>chilling gaurav used to come to my<br>drinks parties in Russia real old pirate<br>russian arctic explorer he is the man<br>who planted a russian flag under the<br>North Pole you will remember five years<br>ago as a symbol of Russia's expectation<br>that when the claims are sorted out they<br>are going to take a lot of the lot of<br>the money I will come back to him as<br>well wonderful guy and the sign of the<br>way the world is changing but we're in<br>for a really serious argument about<br>what's going on in the article ii the<br>Arctic Council which sorts of resides<br>over the Arctic is one of those bisous<br>international organizations which worked<br>wonderfully well when nothing very<br>important is going on but is suddenly<br>facing a very serious demand on its<br>services as people like Chinese the real<br>real international hoodlums try to join<br>okay<br>the other geopolitical effect of course<br>of Russia's growing energy strength is<br>indeed their relationship with China<br>China needless to say very fast-growing<br>huge appetite fast growing appetite for<br>energy there's Russia sitting next door<br>with vast oil and gas fields they've<br>already done a 25 billion dollar deal<br>there's going to be a lot more of that<br>and a lot more pipelines I'm not going<br>to draw any immediate conclusions from<br>that but a world in which Russia and<br>China move together as they have in so<br>many other ways it's obviously an even<br>more challenging world for the goodies<br>like ass and the United States and so on<br>then it might otherwise be ok let's move<br>on then from that rather troubled part<br>of the world to another troubled part of<br>the world the Middle East now the first<br>thing I want to say to you about the<br>Middle East having spent quite a lot of<br>my time on Middle East policy is that<br>not all politics in the Middle East is<br>actually about oil I was heavily<br>involved in the invasion of Iraq and all<br>that which didn't prove an entirely<br>successful venture but we have been<br>accused since of doing that for oil<br>related reasons and that is simply<br>untrue the challenges posed by Saddam<br>notably in terms of weapons of mass<br>destruction were as we thought at the<br>time real and required response and I'm<br>very happy to discuss this afterwards<br>since I know it's not entirely<br>unconscious territory but having said<br>that not all the politics in the regions<br>of our oil and gas an awful lot is here<br>are the world's top oil exporters<br>Russia's actually bit bigger than that<br>now but you will see that this is that<br>of them Saudi Kuwait the UAE and Iran<br>are all Middle Eastern countries<br>fundamentally future global oil and gas<br>policy is about the Middle East that's<br>estimates of current reserves the big<br>yellow bit at the bottom is the Middle<br>East fifty-six percent of current<br>estimated recoverable reserves are in<br>the Middle East this is where energy<br>politics really hits its its crisis and<br>the Middle East various things you can<br>say about it but let me remind you first<br>of all it is a prominent example of the<br>oil curse it is full of or was up until<br>last year full of unreformed very<br>difficult to reform dictatorships and<br>King<br>on the whole very unwilling to become<br>democracies at the time well the world<br>is becoming more democratic i should say<br>there were 12 democracies in the world<br>in 1945 at about 120 now the Middle East<br>did not follow that trend the Arab<br>League States very few of them are 16<br>out of 20 Arab League states are in fact<br>autocracies at the moment if you look at<br>the list of the 10 richest countries in<br>the world two of them are not democratic<br>those to use this example of my students<br>so it's good to be democratic so it<br>makes you rich look at the list of the<br>twin of the ten richest countries in the<br>world because more than 10 probably 15<br>only two of them a democratic are not<br>democratic those are the UAE and Kuwait<br>they're both Arab states so the the<br>resistance in the region to going to mak<br>democratic is very is very strong that<br>is combined with and I find this very<br>hard to explain but the world's most<br>dynamic forward pressing religion which<br>is of course Islam a youth bulge and a<br>whole concatenation of really quite<br>dangerous political pressures coming<br>together in the region and that has<br>already let off various explosions the<br>first was in Iran in 1979 the revolution<br>they're producing a really very<br>difficult to deal with state a state<br>with nuclear aspirations you remember<br>the hostage crisis back straight after<br>the thing if none of you has seen in the<br>film Argo currently or just recently<br>released I strongly recommend it for<br>giving you the flavor of Tehran straight<br>after the Revolution and the US is<br>concerned to get its its hostages out<br>and things went very badly wrong across<br>in Tehran and if I had to predict a big<br>crisis for late this or early next year<br>it's Iran Iran is working very hard to<br>acquire a nuclear weapon they are bust<br>but but rested by very large oil<br>revenues and they show no sign of<br>stopping despite external pressure from<br>the United States and other places and<br>very clear Israeli hints that if nothing<br>else works then military means we'll<br>have to be used you go for Iran there's<br>a threat to the Straits of Hormuz<br>through which eighty percent of the<br>world's oil travels you are really<br>facing a very major crisis so keep your<br>so that the iran was the first outbreak<br>the second outbreak was well let me show<br>you this picture it's very hard to find<br>slides which get over the reality of 911<br>I was in America I was in Washington<br>when it happened and it is impossible to<br>overstate the powerful effect that that<br>terrorist attack had upon the United<br>States and the United States attitude to<br>the world as I say the pictures don't<br>capture it and I thought it best this is<br>a picture of course of the New York<br>waterfront with lights where the World<br>Trade Center used to be this has been a<br>real wrench to our history and as we<br>looked at it as we worked on it in<br>Washington at the time that all that had<br>happened one of the clear conclusions<br>was that the Arab world had gone wrong<br>there was there were various reports<br>done at the time a thing called the<br>world development report which contained<br>all sorts of eye-opening statistics such<br>as that fewer books have been published<br>in the entire Arab world since the<br>invention of printing then are published<br>in Switzerland every year this is a<br>place which has gone culturally very<br>badly wrong princess of Islam I've<br>already mentioned and so on and that<br>translated itself via River anger at<br>what they saw as Western imperialism in<br>to 911 into these events and we began<br>asking ourselves what can we do about<br>this the policy of keeping the Middle<br>East quiet up until then had basically<br>be put up with the dictators keep them<br>in place they're fundamentally friendly<br>because on the whole they're<br>anti-islamic the policy changed after<br>nine eleven believe it or not too much<br>more pressure on people like President<br>Mubarak of Egypt and so on to begin two<br>democracies their government sees it was<br>a varying effect on the whole it was<br>pretty ineffective the Arab world as<br>I've already said remain a thoroughly<br>undemocratic place until we get to the<br>end of 2011 when suddenly technology<br>catches up with the whole region and the<br>Arab Spring takes place a whole string<br>of autocratic governments fall in Egypt<br>in<br>in Tunisia in Libya we help it fall the<br>war is still going on in Syria all of<br>that now that sounds a long way from the<br>oil-producing end of the of the Arab<br>world but isn't actually that far the<br>cultural and social links are very close<br>the the people move between the two<br>things and watch each other and indeed<br>it has to some extent affected the<br>oil-producing Gulf kuwait has had<br>immense problems and has had to become<br>substantially more democratic there is<br>you probably read about in the papers<br>this week a renewal of the insurgency in<br>Bahrain Bahrain is an effective part of<br>Saudi Arabia just across the Straits<br>from the oil-producing Eastern Province<br>of Saudi Arabia and was potentially<br>exactly the same problems it's a sheer<br>Sunni problem in Bahrain as it could<br>easily be in Saudi Arabia as well so<br>this conflagration hasn't yet seriously<br>hit oil production but it's burning at<br>the edges it's there it's very close it<br>could very easily tip over very quickly<br>let me show you this man mohamed mursi<br>who in the sentences at the center of it<br>the new president of Egypt you have seen<br>the problems he has had he's an Islamic<br>brother one of the hawaon trying to<br>impose a more Islamic way of government<br>in Egypt the country is virtually<br>unguardable at the moment if he falls<br>who knows what will follow his fate is a<br>reflection of the fate of an awful lot<br>of the Arab world after him so there are<br>real threats out there to to to our oil<br>production gas production the Middle<br>East it's under control at the moment as<br>I say it's burning around the edges and<br>to come back to a point i made about<br>russia to deal with this in the gulf the<br>way they've done it as the Russians did<br>is dish out money to their people social<br>spending throughout the Gulf has gone to<br>immense links and these are the<br>break-even prices for oil now in the<br>Gulf you'll see that Saudi Arabia cannot<br>run its government if the oil price<br>falls below eighty four dollars a barrel<br>guitar $65 Kuwait eighty eight dollars<br>and so on again you have key oil<br>producers who cannot let the price fall<br>too far because the consequence would be<br>social disruption<br>and potentially revolution in their<br>countries another reason why I'm<br>inclined to believe whatever happens<br>with shale that we're living in a high<br>price oil world for the foreseeable<br>future and there are big big questions<br>about the whole future of the region is<br>it turning Islamist what's going to<br>happen the Middle East dispute with<br>Israel will the the troubles of Egypt<br>and Tunisia and so on in fact Saudi<br>Arabia and guitar and the Gulf Coast ins<br>and this is important because there's<br>one external player who has been crucial<br>to maintaining stability believe it or<br>not in the Middle East and guiding the<br>place in roughly the right direction<br>which is the United States and the<br>United States people are beginning to<br>worry actually doesn't have the<br>incentives to maintain the same interest<br>the same grip that it has had in the<br>past as I've said shale gas shale oil<br>increasingly are moving the United<br>States toward energy self-sufficiency BP<br>are now predicting that the United<br>States will be energy self-sufficient in<br>the next 30 years now if they're<br>self-sufficient why do they need to<br>worry anymore about defending the oil<br>passages defending the world's seaways<br>keeping as far as they can some peace in<br>the major oil-producing areas of the<br>world there are good answers to that<br>question they obviously have other<br>interests in see passages apart from oil<br>they have a very real interest in Israel<br>in the region but at the very least I<br>think the pressures on the United States<br>to be out there doing things diminish<br>and the United States coming has a<br>president mr. Obama who in his<br>inauguration speech and others has<br>visibly pulled back from u.s.<br>involvement in in the outside world he's<br>withdrawing from Afghanistan pivoting to<br>your region of the world because China<br>is increasingly dominant in the way they<br>view the world and therefore odds-on and<br>also reducing their armed forces as a<br>whole so the odds are very much that the<br>United States is going to be less<br>concerned and less interested in<br>maintaining stability in this region<br>than has been the case up until now and<br>that's a worry say what you like a bit<br>but the big brutal fascist United States<br>we depend on them we you know they are<br>the guys who keep the peace there the<br>sheriff no sheriff and anarchy follows<br>finally let me turn to Mike the third<br>chunk of my career which I promised you<br>climate change now when I came here I<br>assume good green New Zealand I wouldn't<br>need to justify the facts of climate<br>change to an audience such as this and I<br>find myself at a family barbecue a week<br>ago talking to my family who I can sure<br>you're very civilized people who<br>expressed skepticism so I thought it<br>important to take you very quickly<br>through the facts just so that we are<br>quite clear that this is a real problem<br>and a real challenge that's a graph of<br>greenhouse gas concentrations in the<br>atmosphere over the last 2,000 years and<br>you can see what happens at the end<br>there it goes off the scale that's<br>already happening I've been inventing<br>this that's a real change in the<br>composition of our atmosphere that and<br>the science linking greenhouse gas<br>concentrations in the atmosphere to<br>global temperatures is incontrovertible<br>nobody argues about it if it didn't<br>exist they've kept the the planet we<br>live on will be uninhabitable the<br>planetary temperature we've got minus 15<br>it is actually six on average and the<br>reason for that 21 degree difference is<br>because there are greenhouse gas<br>concentrations in the atmosphere as a<br>result therefore of the change in the<br>composition of the atmosphere global<br>temperatures have also gone up this<br>takes you back from pre-industrial times<br>up till now and climate change skeptics<br>I have to say who made great play of<br>this flattening out over the last few<br>years but the reality is that the world<br>is now already significantly warmer than<br>it was significantly point 8 of a degree<br>that doesn't sound like much but that<br>contains a lot of extra energy in the<br>atmosphere contains the potential for<br>droughts in the Midwest as we've just<br>seen for hurricanes and Europeans we've<br>just seen and so on the sea is higher<br>it's quite striking that in the UK we've<br>redirected the splendid thames barrier<br>which is designed to prevent tidal<br>surges hitting london when we built it<br>we expected to raise it about once every<br>two years we're now raising it six times<br>a year and that is entirely the<br>consequence of much bigger wins over the<br>north<br>see combined with a higher North Sea you<br>sit you have the consequences in this<br>part of the world coral bleaching your<br>course in the on Great Barrier Reef all<br>sorts of things I'm going to come back<br>the Antarctic of the Arctic but I've<br>already mentioned it there the ice is<br>going so climate change is real again<br>I'm happy to come back to this<br>afterwards but that is an unavoidable<br>fact and therefore what are we doing<br>about it what we doing about is we've<br>had a great negotiation which I was an<br>early participant in it started at the<br>Rio so called Earth Summit back in 1992<br>and he's been going on ever since and I<br>this is a very patent Tony Brenton graph<br>this is my graph of the progress of the<br>climate change negotiating process<br>because I like sure about this to<br>Cambridge students we start off back<br>here what is up here is the level of<br>commitment by governments and what's<br>along here is time of course so we start<br>off back here with nobody really<br>believing in it at all then a think all<br>the IPCC the Intergovernmental Panel on<br>Climate Change produced a report a<br>worrying report back then which pushed<br>us all into the go skating or rather<br>meaningless agreement at Rio the<br>so-called climate change convention<br>whereupon everybody cheerfully lost<br>interest and the attention fell away<br>until the IPCC produced another even<br>scarier report in 1995 which then shoved<br>us into a really quite demanding<br>negotiation which produced what looked<br>like a pretty good agreement at Kyoto in<br>whenever that whilst 1997 except that<br>the Americans instantly recused<br>themselves and said we're not going to<br>do what we're committing ourselves to<br>here in terms of global greenhouse gas<br>emissions so we all lost interest again<br>the IPCC we then got caught up and this<br>is a ridiculous story in getting Kyoto<br>into force even without the United<br>States but the IPCC then produced two<br>more reports of growing levels of<br>scariness about sea level rises as I say<br>hurricanes droughts the whole works and<br>that kicked us into another round of<br>negotiation which produced in particular<br>the famous Copenhagen meeting where<br>Obama found himself in a room with a<br>deputy Chinese Foreign Minister at the<br>end and and brings us on to Durban which<br>is the most recent meeting that we've<br>had now that all looks quite encouraging<br>you start off very low and you end up<br>quite high but this 20 years of<br>negotiation actually has not produced<br>any measurable effect at all<br>on the on the shape of the atmosphere<br>over those 20 years atmosphere<br>concentration at Mysterio emissions of<br>global health munoz gases have in fact<br>gone up by forty five percent why<br>developed countries as I pointed out in<br>an earlier slide the air emissions are<br>roughly speaking flat the answer of<br>course is China again there are Chinese<br>versus u.s. emissions over the period<br>since 1990 and this means the whole<br>negotiation has changed what started off<br>as a negotiation between developed<br>countries about getting their emissions<br>down with the developing countries<br>saying you put it there you sort<br>yourselves out our business is is<br>economic development and we're going to<br>burn as much coal and oil and gas as we<br>need to achieve that we are now in a<br>world where that no longer works where<br>the developing countries have to make a<br>contribution to getting emissions down<br>because otherwise with China emitting in<br>the way they are any agreement is<br>meaningless and that's one reason why<br>going back a minute one reason why this<br>graph does rise optimistically at the<br>end because China and India and so on<br>are finally coming on board and green<br>optimistic there that is 20 years<br>negotiation no tangible product it's<br>going to take a long long time to turn<br>this gruesome process into really<br>binding cats in the atmospheric layers<br>in an atmospheric concentrations as I<br>say this whole exercise was very good<br>for my bridge because the developing<br>world used to go off in the thing called<br>the g77 and have vast discussions among<br>themselves we were left sitting around<br>doing nothing so I played bridge with<br>the Americans and all the other people<br>and I think I can even stand up to my<br>mother now so are we facing real<br>disaster possibly as I say this<br>negotiation even if it gets some way<br>it's going to get there too late there's<br>one rather optimistic thing which I<br>cannot resist mention any however which<br>is a concept which is arisen recently<br>concept of geoengineering the idea that<br>even if the governments of the world<br>can't agree to get their emissions down<br>you can somehow tinker with the<br>atmosphere in a way that limits the<br>amount of sunlight coming in there's<br>some crazy ideas like mirroring over the<br>Sahara Desert so the sunlight<br>to be reflected back but they're also<br>some quite sensible and cost-effective<br>ideas if you so the upper atmosphere<br>with sulfur that reflects back the<br>sunlight and you can get I mean this is<br>something that volcanoes do anyway after<br>Krakatoa blew up global temperatures<br>fell by about half a degree for about a<br>decade so that is a possibility and one<br>other possibility is feeding the ocean<br>plankton with iron filings because that<br>makes them grow and they each carbon<br>dioxide the problem is that<br>environmentalist hate it because of<br>course you're tinkering with a global a<br>global one of the global Commons in a<br>very profound way and also it's<br>uncontrollable in individual government<br>the United States or China actually<br>could afford to sew the upper atmosphere<br>the sulfur without any international<br>agreement at all so let me introduce me<br>to the third bearded man in my in my<br>gallery Russ George story last year he's<br>an American entrepreneur scientist what<br>have you he went off to the Pacific last<br>year with a hundred tons of iron sulfate<br>in the puttin in the bowels of his ship<br>and so a load of plankton with his iron<br>sulfate huge outcry The Guardian and<br>similar places said this is awful he's<br>playing with it but that sort of<br>individual intervention in the climate<br>is now more and more possible and more<br>and more likely the longer it takes us<br>to get a proper international agreement<br>on it so where do we end up at the end<br>of that rather miscellaneous tour of<br>global energy matters I hate these sorts<br>of slides when I thought I should write<br>this down anyway firstly Energy's going<br>to remain a key driver of world politics<br>as we go become more energy dependent as<br>we burn more whether or not we put<br>carbon dioxide at the atmosphere and we<br>worry more about where we're getting<br>from it it's going to be there front and<br>center of global politics as I have said<br>a graph of global oil prices as an<br>effective graph of Russian politics over<br>the last twenty years and that's going<br>to be about fossil fuels the estimate is<br>that by 2030 they will still account for<br>eighty-two percent of global use by then<br>secondly the key producing countries are<br>going to remain the same troublesome<br>bunch that they are at the moment we're<br>going to have to live with a Russia<br>which is very big in the energy<br>producing field and in particular<br>middle east which in if anything is<br>going to loom larger and larger it's<br>been estimated that ninety-one percent<br>of the growth in global oil production<br>up to 20 25 is going to be in the Gulf<br>so we can have to carry on worrying<br>about these very worried producing<br>countries third the pattern of<br>consumption is changing as I showed you<br>on an earlier slide seventy percent of<br>the growth is now taking place in<br>non-oecd countries particularly in India<br>and China now this has real political<br>consequences it means that countries<br>like the US able to worry less about<br>international see passages it means it<br>countries like China are going to worry<br>more and I perhaps going to get more<br>involved in policing the global sea<br>passages and so on it means as I've said<br>there's every prospect of Russia and<br>China drawing even closer together at a<br>time when that is not a very attractive<br>prospect for the Western nations and of<br>course as I've said the achievement by<br>the US of energy independence which<br>gives them the ability to step back if<br>they want to I suspect they don't want<br>to but I suspect they would be less<br>interested so we have a partially<br>disengaged sheriff with all of the all<br>of the implications that that carries<br>fourth point we're not going to solve<br>climate change in the immediate future<br>or even in the non immediate future for<br>a few decades we're going to going to<br>live in a world which is going to get<br>warmer where the seeds are going to get<br>higher where plankton are going to get<br>fatter where coral is going to continue<br>to die where we're going to have<br>hurricanes droughts all of that I'm not<br>predicting Armageddon but I am<br>predicting a world which is going to be<br>significantly different we have paper<br>and cafes all over London when did that<br>happen a world which is going to be<br>significantly different from the world<br>we now live in and it's a world since we<br>can't stop it that we're going to have<br>to adapt to and finally having made all<br>of those bland bland but broad<br>assertions about the world energy world<br>there are very big uncertainties out<br>there I've mentioned a couple shale gas<br>and geoengineering either of them could<br>knock any of all of these predictions<br>sideways if they're if shale turns out<br>to be as big as it looks as in the<br>United States then that's going to have<br>a serious effect and if people start<br>seriously geoengineering then thank God<br>we can forget about the UN<br>and carry on with other things but<br>there's a danger lots of side effects so<br>I would treat all predictions in the<br>energy world including the ones that I<br>have offered you with skepticism and I<br>couldn't resist putting that thought in<br>a rather more colorful way I remind you<br>of archer chillin gaurav Mohamed Mursi<br>and grant Russell avoid men with beards</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
