middle of the solution.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>right thank you very much for those kind<br>words bezel what I would say actually<br>just on bit about market capitalization<br>or your capital markets actually zed is<br>the largest capital listing that's a not<br>a government SOE type things since<br>telecom in 1991 I think some of us might<br>forget that much as we think telecom is<br>owned by the government they were<br>actually sold to American shareholders<br>and then eventually listed so as much as<br>we're proud to be able to bring you know<br>some exposure to our sector to the<br>capital markets in New Zealand it sort<br>of says something about our capital<br>markets where you know zeid can come to<br>market and with the biggest listing for<br>20-odd years so certainly something to<br>think about and I'm sure when you run a<br>series on capital markets I'd like this<br>they have someone speak a little bit<br>about about Zed so I'm really pleased to<br>be able to share a few thoughts with you<br>today I will say some things that I will<br>introduce that may sound like I'm taking<br>a position on something and I just like<br>to say i'm not i'm just trying to share<br>some things that would provoke thought<br>so but for example i talked a bit about<br>fracking and I know that's particularly<br>controversial I'm not declaring whether<br>I think it's good or bad and some<br>respects I don't know enough to have a<br>real opinion on that but I want to<br>introduce some things to actually<br>provoke thinking and to stimulate<br>discussion because one of the reasons<br>that we choose to do things like this or<br>me in particular is because I think New<br>Zealand could do with some thought<br>leadership in this space so in a role<br>like mine particularly when we are a<br>public company I get even yesterday had<br>three invitations of speak at various<br>conferences and what we do in zere is we<br>limit what we speak about because we<br>actually want to provide ad I think I'm<br>going yep I want to provide thought<br>leadership can everyone hear me okay yep<br>I want to make sure that we provide<br>thought leadership and clearly any<br>company can't provide thought or I think<br>it shouldn't provide thought leadership<br>on everything so we choose to provide<br>thought leadership on a limited number<br>of things and certainly our focus in the<br>last two years is to be it is to be<br>available to provide thought leadership<br>around yeah fossil fuels and<br>sustainability and again that thought<br>leadership isn't here at our ideas and<br>everyone must believe them it's actually<br>we want to stimulate discussion so as I<br>talk today<br>please engage with me on on that basis<br>and equally when you think about it yeah<br>why would you want to listen to me<br>anyway because I am one of the world's<br>filthiest polluters now in terms of the<br>products that we sell we contribute to<br>about ninety percent of consumers carbon<br>emissions and about twenty five percent<br>on average of company carbon emissions<br>in New Zealand so why the heck would<br>someone like me want to come along and<br>talk about fossil fuels given the<br>pollution that I spew out and<br>sustainability well part of it is you<br>know we've got to do something about<br>this I come from a big oil background I<br>spent 25 years with BP 17 years outside<br>of New Zealand and I learned a lot of<br>stuff I learned what companies like that<br>do well I learn what companies like that<br>fail on and how other people think about<br>companies like that and was it given<br>that we're you know we're only so small<br>we only care about New Zealand and<br>actually we have no upstream interests<br>so we don't have billions of dollars<br>invested in upstream production where<br>we've got to find a way to monetize the<br>oil that we produce all the guests that<br>we produce we just happen to sell<br>transport fuels and the transport feel<br>that we sell at the moment is a fossil<br>fuel and that seems to be the one that's<br>most economic but actually as a company<br>we r ambivalent about whether we sell<br>fossil fuels electrons hydrogen biofuel<br>any other type of liquid fuel if it<br>requires a distributed network and its<br>most likely to be a high fixed cost low<br>margin business well we already have a<br>business model around that right so<br>again we're really ambivalent around<br>actually what we sell and when you start<br>to frame up a paradigm and again you see<br>from the title of my talk today it is<br>about you know existing paradoxes or new<br>paradigms we work a lot in sides it to<br>try and reframe things or put it into<br>another paradigm to open up an avenue<br>for us to explore to us to inquire into<br>for us to provide thought leadership on<br>and ultimately for us to do something<br>about so I'm not here today as a<br>representative of big oil I'm here today<br>as somebody who sells transport fuels<br>and recognizing the need that that has<br>for the energy requirements in New<br>Zealand and actually is a chance for us<br>to do something about that because we<br>really are the gatekeepers to the<br>industry if we don't if we don't change<br>or the government doesn't force us to<br>change nothing will change and I'm just<br>not too sure that I want to sit around<br>and wait for whatever else happens<br>forces the change which I guess many<br>people would think particularly after<br>the IPCC report on for on Friday says<br>probably is going to be more cataclysmic<br>that will finally cause a change rather<br>than people getting committed about<br>about stuff so we want to be responsible<br>and become accountable for what we do<br>because we believe we have this really<br>unique set of circumstances we're here<br>in New Zealand we only care about New<br>Zealand we're ambivalent about what we<br>sell provided we can make a return for<br>our shareholders and an actual fact<br>there's a lot more that we could be<br>doing and they're up there is a list of<br>things that said holds to be true and we<br>actually embarked upon a bit of<br>listening when we first started the<br>company and yeah we took over from shell<br>and april 2010 and we conducted one of<br>the largest pieces of research ever<br>conducted in New Zealand and we<br>effectively listen to what 17,000 people<br>had to say but that's the equivalent of<br>stopping everybody in ashburton often in<br>a cup of tea and thus gone and sitting<br>down to listening to go to what's on<br>their mind and after all of that we had<br>a great deal of feedback about what we<br>could do or couldn't do about our<br>service stations our customer offers but<br>our participation in commercial markets<br>all the stuff you'd expect but equally<br>we've got a lot of feedback around how<br>people view a company like us what they<br>think about our brand what their<br>expectations are of us around our<br>environmental impact our social impact<br>not just our economic impact so we put<br>all that together we said actually<br>there's a bunch of things we could do<br>here and we can we also did and I'm sort<br>of contents of Duncan's is here in the<br>room I am I along with my general<br>manager of corporate who deals with our<br>strategy stuff we put our hands out<br>after all that research we settle up<br>with yeah if you like that people in New<br>Zealand have spoken but actually we need<br>to get a bit of expertise so we went out<br>and we had what we call sustainability<br>dinners and I invited a number of people<br>most of whom wouldn't want to be seen in<br>the same restaurant as myself frankly to<br>sit down and say could we talk about<br>sustainability so we invited people from<br>the Green Party we invited people from<br>our in NGOs we invited the X<br>parliamentary commissioner for the<br>environment we invited our Morrison from<br>our dock and so it goes on and these<br>would always comfortable invitations to<br>issue so in many cases I<br>she wrote a two-page personal letter to<br>all of those people almost pleading them<br>to put along put to the side their bias<br>against someone like me to engage in a<br>conversation and so we got we had four<br>of these dinners of gatherings about<br>four to five five people and we just sat<br>down and we said like I will what do you<br>think we could do and we just got all<br>this wonderful expertise and feedback<br>and it wasn't always comfortable but<br>what we do at the end of the night we'd<br>sit down with my general manager<br>corporate Linda somebody sit down and we<br>just we did document up everything that<br>we'd heard and so when those people got<br>back to the offices or their<br>organizations the next day they had a<br>documentation a written record of what<br>we'd heard so they had the chance that<br>we had a chance to check that we'd heard<br>things correctly and that really helped<br>inform us a great deal that we<br>eventually said this is what we stand<br>for so there's these evidence out there<br>that says you know climate change is<br>real and it's caused by human activity<br>well that's one place to start but we<br>equally said these are the things that<br>we stand by and we're happy to be held<br>accountable for that and that form the<br>basis of it's about two pages i think<br>our sustainability policy which we have<br>published on the web that we've put<br>we've sets and long-term goals around<br>that and we make ourselves accountable<br>through the annual review about how well<br>we're doing on those things so give from<br>the very very GetGo by the end of this<br>would have been the end of 2010 we're<br>already in the game and what i mean by<br>we're in the game as we made public<br>statements and now if we back off those<br>we look like idiots yeah and then we<br>undermine our reputation and<br>particularly our brand which eventually<br>became the zine brain wasn't said in the<br>beginning the key thing is we're in the<br>game we are gatekeepers to the industry<br>and nothing will change and it's a<br>company like us does something about it<br>so we had four pillars for<br>sustainability first word is useless and<br>waste less my view there is if you don't<br>take care of your own back garden then<br>you're not really in the game well you<br>don't really have the right to work with<br>your customers or work with other parts<br>of New Zealand business community and<br>talk about what you could do so what<br>we're doing there is all the obvious<br>things that you would expect us to do<br>yeah we've got a waste no longer going<br>to web landfill we put 40 tons and the<br>last year 40 tons of food waste has gone<br>to compost rather than landfill<br>we're replacing all the under canopy<br>lights on our service stations two and<br>half million dollar spend will save a<br>fifty percent of our costs and energy<br>will reduce our carbon emissions for<br>that part of our business by sixteen<br>percent and effectively create enough<br>free up enough energy to power 350 homes<br>across new zealand all of our company<br>cars are hybrids yeah so as they as the<br>leases on the old vehicles run off<br>they're all moving into into hybrid<br>vehicles so we're doing a bunch of stuff<br>that you'd sort of expect us to do but<br>here's the real kicker if if you thought<br>about the carbon emissions that are a<br>result of our activity and you you<br>called them seats on an aeroplane so<br>seek 1ae is everything we do in our<br>offices and all of our service stations<br>that's how much carbon we a bit sick won<br>a seat 1 B is the carbon that gets<br>emitted from our entire supply chain<br>from boats that bring crew to New<br>Zealand for the boats that move products<br>around the country and all the trucks<br>that deliver those products to service<br>stations and commercial customers so 1a<br>and 1b if you then took the next four<br>rows that's the equivalent of the carbon<br>that gets thrown out of our share of the<br>New Zealand refining company so 1a was<br>just us one busy our supply chain for<br>more rows is what comes out of the<br>refinery and it's another two and a half<br>planes of seats that actually come from<br>the carbon emissions from the products<br>that our customers eventually use so<br>though it's important to get after you<br>know seat 1a and making that if you like<br>as small as possible if you if you stick<br>with the metaphor the really big issue<br>is actually at how customers use our<br>products so we're going to use listen<br>waste lists we are going to reduce the<br>carbon intensity of what we do and the<br>products that people use and we've got<br>some ideas and I'll share a couple of<br>specifics later on about how we actually<br>get customers to use less of our<br>products now most people say to me Mike<br>you must be an absolute idiot why would<br>why do you want people to use a list of<br>your products because that sort of seems<br>to be the antithesis of what company<br>should do they want people to use more<br>of their products or services because<br>that's where profits come from but again<br>here's it here's another way to shape<br>the paradigm inside zid our post tax<br>profits are about 3 cents a litre<br>right now you multiply it by two and a<br>half billion liters and it adds up to<br>quite a large amount of money but it's<br>three and a half cents a litre so what<br>we said to ourselves the paradigm we've<br>created is we could sell twenty percent<br>less but if the price of our products<br>were not by five percent we're actually<br>more profitable so I'll say that again<br>if we sold twenty percent less of our<br>products but we put the selling price up<br>by five percent we would be more<br>profitable so if I could find some way<br>to come to you and say I've found a<br>technology or some other thing that<br>enables you to save twenty twenty<br>percent of of the consumption of our<br>products but I'd like you to pay five<br>percent more per unit well you'd be the<br>idiot not to take up that option so<br>again this whole notion of reshaping the<br>paradigm allows us to open up our<br>thinking so we've now said our success<br>doesn't have to come from selling more<br>our success comes from actually getting<br>our unit margins up so whole lot of<br>things open up to us when we think that<br>actually well what would it will be like<br>if we sold twenty percent less and we<br>made five percent more per unit and by<br>the way of our industry sold twenty<br>percent less across the whole industry<br>our commitment or the lack of commitment<br>took the kyoto protocol would be met and<br>full so that's why the twenty percent is<br>not just that number we dreamed up it's<br>actually it has some other meaning<br>beyond that so we don't fear I'm<br>reducing our customers carbon intensity<br>we clearly want to get the one wean them<br>off fossil fuels and as I mentioned<br>before we don't really mind what people<br>buy as long as it's a transport energy<br>we have a business model in Abel's us to<br>be effective and efficient and generate<br>returns for our shareholders for the<br>risks that they take so we actually want<br>to reduce New Zealand's reliance on<br>fossil fuels and the last one is we<br>actually want to support new zealand so<br>we think we have some very special<br>responsibilities by being a new zealand<br>company that sets change a little bit in<br>the last wee while originally we were<br>owned by infertile and go half owned by<br>the new zealand super fund so you know<br>many all of New Zealanders had an<br>exposure to us through the New Zealand<br>super fund yet but now we're a public<br>company here we've got more than 10,000<br>young mums and dads who actually own a<br>piece of zeid today so that only<br>changing on the 19th of August when we<br>listed the company so we think by being<br>a key week at me we have a lot more<br>responsibilities and indeed the research<br>told us that<br>what the research says well look we're<br>willing to give you guys a break as a<br>Kiwi firm competing against the global<br>guys but gr tell you what you better<br>front up to some of the responsibilities<br>so if something goes wrong we expect you<br>to step in and sort it out we expect you<br>to take leadership on the things that<br>really matter to us beyond just giving<br>us the goods that provide us a utility<br>we need to use your products so things<br>like environment and the social outcomes<br>they have greater expectations of us<br>than they do have some of the largest<br>companies in the world against whom we<br>compete so how do we do that well we<br>when we rebranded yeah we changed<br>everything from shelters said we went<br>out of our way to actually use New<br>Zealand signage manufacturers so rather<br>than just going to China and buying it<br>cheap like a lot of things that you do<br>when we went to the New Zealand<br>manufacturers some of them couldn't do<br>it and some of them certainly couldn't<br>do it at the prices we were looking for<br>but we partnered with him and we found a<br>way to get it down it wasn't as cheap as<br>buying it from overseas but it was<br>within a reasonable range but with your<br>hope if you if you lead your business<br>from that commitment again a lot more<br>things become possible to future if you<br>change the paradigm so we work very very<br>closely at doing what we can to support<br>new zealand probably the most visible<br>aspect of that is the good in the hood<br>program where we actually said i find<br>out that's fantastic for me now i get so<br>many requests to sponsor things and i<br>say to people and so i don't have the<br>authority to do that our customers<br>decide where our sponsorship or our<br>community investment dollars go I don't<br>I don't I don't get to do that anymore<br>and equally we've done a lot of work<br>around the two and a half thousand<br>people who work on our service stations<br>to actually help them upgrade their own<br>skills so we've recently had some<br>graduates come through that program<br>where they have some NZQA recognised<br>qualifications now by there on the job<br>experience with us and how we work with<br>them to develop their own skills so<br>again we very much focused on equally<br>social outcomes in the sustainability<br>space as we are around the environmental<br>outcomes so what we do is we have set<br>goals for all of those through the 2015<br>we've published them there in our annual<br>review and I got to be honest with you<br>half of the goals we set when we set<br>them we didn't know how to do it right<br>so you imagine what conversation that's<br>like I should have one of my directors<br>in the room and she wasn't a director at<br>the time but even the directors didn't<br>even know about that it was like we've<br>just got to stand for something bigger<br>and put it out there but what has opened<br>up for us as a whole lot of things one<br>is we have to be a lot more innovative<br>we have to be a lot more participative<br>and cooperative with people because if<br>you don't know what you don't know well<br>you don't know how to get something done<br>you've got to go about it in a really<br>really different way because working<br>harder is not going to solve it so I<br>fully expect that you know of the 16<br>goals that we've put out there there's<br>probably four or five of those that we<br>will not meet I wouldn't necessarily<br>class that as failure because we'll have<br>made substantial progress but actually<br>when you take a risk like that you are<br>going to end up with a certain amount of<br>failure if I could call it that so when<br>it comes to sustainability and it sort<br>of sort of cut to the the guts of the<br>whole fossil fuels debate I think there<br>are three things that are on the go that<br>cause change in the world and any one of<br>these and you know clearly that the<br>metaphors there around around the gears<br>any one of the gears can turn but it's<br>only through the interconnection of all<br>three that actually you start to affect<br>change so if you take sort of the one<br>down the bottom here which is that you<br>clearly has made big 40 for a reason the<br>whole environmental thing is really<br>important and as I said you know the<br>IPCC put their report out on Friday and<br>yeah there's further scientific evidence<br>or more people believing a higher<br>probability that actually fossil fuels<br>cause climate change equally got this<br>whole thing around the sort of the<br>social aspect of things so there is a<br>small group of really committed people<br>there might be many when you put them on<br>a global basis but actually as a<br>proportion of the population it's still<br>quite a small proportion of the<br>population that are in action around<br>doing something for environmental<br>sustainability and then when it comes to<br>this whole economic thing there's been a<br>heck of a lot that's changed in this in<br>the space that I think profoundly<br>affects what was what the path we were<br>on around moving away from fossil fuels<br>and you get the whole global financial<br>crisis has has fundamentally changed<br>things it's changed the company's<br>willingness to take risk it's changed<br>people's affordability around it it's<br>caused people to think twice about how<br>and where they invest money how much<br>risk there personally willing to take on<br>this is what companies may want to take<br>on and you've got this whole notion that<br>yes sort of and I can recall because I<br>used to run a trade and oil trading<br>business<br>and I can recall being in the middle<br>east with you know the people in the<br>Middle East that the sheiks and all that<br>when oil went through forty dollars a<br>barrel and I can't and that was in<br>October of 2004 and they were not happy<br>about that because they thought that was<br>going to be the end of their business<br>because that that high price was going<br>to completely crater demand and it would<br>force people into alternatives I go back<br>a year later and oils about seventy<br>dollars a pound it's a completely<br>different conversation now a lot of<br>people have forgotten but in July of<br>2008 we were on our way who had one<br>hundred forty seven dollars a barrel US<br>oil so the whole notion around<br>alternative fuels and all that stuff<br>they had this massive momentum behind it<br>that caused a whole lot of money to go<br>into the sector whether it be solar or<br>alternatives to liquid transport fuels<br>and that's completely gone in my view<br>it's not just the GFC but the whole the<br>whole theory around peak oil I think has<br>changed a lot and indeed I think the<br>price points around crude are<br>fundamentally different to where they<br>were back in 2008 so things have changed<br>quite a lot is actually a quote I'd like<br>to read from it was a BBC hardtalk<br>interview with am the one of the the<br>chief economists from the the<br>International Energy Agency and he talks<br>a bit about subsidies on fossil fuels<br>because you may not know this is<br>whatever the price point is there's<br>quite a lot of countries in the world<br>that are subsidizing fuel and I'm not<br>talking about the Middle East but I'm<br>talking about India China Malaysia<br>Indonesia so some of the world's highest<br>growth demand points for fossil fuels<br>are subsidizing the product and he says<br>our fuel subsidies are the number one<br>enemy of climate change ninety percent<br>of fuel subsidies go to the middle and<br>upper classes whereas we tend to think<br>about subsidies being things that<br>subsidize that poor people in those<br>countries they can't afford fuel they're<br>still burning wood or coal or some other<br>product to actually meet their needs<br>they are they can't afford a car they<br>don't necessarily use LPG for their<br>cooking so it's a really really got this<br>mess of price spike that might have been<br>there but as powder that's always been<br>insulated from the market because of<br>what these countries are doing for their<br>own good reasons and you think I was<br>going to say that our<br>and taxes are necessary to change<br>behavior as oil gas and coal markets do<br>not and will not give sufficient price<br>signals so I don't always agree with<br>what the IEA had to say and in some<br>respects they're much more experts at<br>what they do than I am I tend to think<br>they're a bit behind the pace they get<br>there but they're usually two or three<br>years behind you know with a market set<br>but it's really interesting for me that<br>the chief economist talks about the<br>impact of fossil fuel subsidies where<br>the demand is strongest and he also<br>talks about the need for price signals<br>around carbon to cause a change in<br>behavior so those gears are all grinding<br>away so I want to talk a little bit more<br>about why things are changing so getting<br>pretty simple slide the way it was in<br>the way I think it is now and do i think<br>it is now again i'm offering this up as<br>a place to think from rather than it is<br>the truth that's sort of the generosity<br>i asked for early on so before we still<br>live in a world of peak oil and oil was<br>on its way to two hundred dollars a<br>barrel what I point to today is actually<br>we are growing these non conventional<br>oil supplies you know and again there's<br>a consequence to that but tar sands in<br>Canada shale oil and gas in the u.s.<br>deepwater drilling you know they go down<br>for miles now and the Gulf of Mexico<br>will West Africa or they go down a<br>little bit and they go for miles<br>horizontally before they drill down and<br>get the stuff again there's a lot more<br>non-conventional supplies that come onto<br>the market and they're called<br>non-conventional because they weren't<br>the way it was 20 years ago but when<br>some of these technologies or sources<br>are available and they've been there for<br>20 years I'm not sure you can call them<br>non-conventional anymore because they<br>are very much part of the mainstream the<br>others whole notion of the rise of what<br>is now called Saudi AMERICA AMERICA used<br>to be the world's largest importer of<br>crude and and products by 2017 they will<br>produce more oil than Saudi Arabia by<br>2020 they will no longer be importing<br>any oil now you've got to think about<br>what does that do to the world's<br>geopolitics when the u.s. don't really<br>care what happens in the Middle East<br>anymore right they spend a billion<br>dollars a year on a carrier group in the<br>Middle East making sure things are<br>settled enough for oil to continue to<br>flow to the US now 2017 is not that long<br>away I mean I was really clever I tell<br>you how many days<br>but you know it's about 1250 odd days<br>isn't it it's not that long before they<br>become the world's largest all produce<br>it actually read some research yesterday<br>that said they could be there by 2015 so<br>they're fundamentally the world's<br>changing so this whole notion around<br>Peak Oil theory or price points driving<br>the move towards renewables or<br>alternatives to fossil fuels in my view<br>has greatly diminished the second point<br>is yeah businesses and yeah I happen to<br>be responsible for one we're like a<br>certain amount of certainty will me when<br>we get into stuff and a lot of that<br>thing a lot of day has become uncertain<br>so you got the situation now where you<br>know what is sometimes called the the<br>Great Recession yeah the world has<br>changed and I gave you some evidence for<br>that earlier on but equally and again<br>dr. burr rollin in this hard talkin have<br>you said in 2012 the year-on-year<br>investment change in renewables declined<br>for the first time in over a decade<br>there are even though we are now four or<br>five years after the Great Recession for<br>the first time there's been this year on<br>year declined an investment in<br>renewables compared to the previous<br>decade so I come from a market<br>background so you know markets speak the<br>market is saying actually investment and<br>alternatives to fossil fuels less<br>favorable today than they were a year<br>ago and have been for the past decade<br>sort of kind of interesting at the same<br>time you've probably got more evidence<br>around the need to do something about<br>fossil fuels given the impact on climate<br>change then we come down to sort of the<br>regulatory space there's quite a lot<br>quite a big move away from nuclear<br>options and what I mean by that in a<br>very tragic tsunami in Japan but it<br>actually happened at a time there are a<br>number of nuclear plants around the<br>world that we're up for real I f---ing<br>and now I think even in Germany they<br>decided they're going to close down some<br>of their nuclear capacity you Japan<br>certainly closed it down so again I<br>don't have a strong view on whether<br>nuclear's better or worse but think<br>about an alternative to fossil fuels is<br>actually there's much less capacity or<br>demand sorry supply that's coming on<br>stream there I mean clearly Kyoto too<br>has been a failure and New Zealand's<br>sort of put its colours to the mast and<br>said we're not committed to that in the<br>way that we were previously as well<br>you've got a situation where carbon<br>prices have absolutely collapsed New<br>Zealand brought an emissions trading<br>scheme at price carbon units at $25 a<br>ton and kiwi dollars I wasn't that many<br>months ago that I could have gone out<br>and bought that and met my obligation at<br>twenty cents so point one percent of<br>what was put in place to drive behavior<br>change nothing I point out is that that<br>behavior change it equates to about 3<br>cents a litre $25 a ton now you I know<br>that actually it's not so much the<br>amount that causes the change in<br>people's demand for our products it's a<br>price point so the first time prices go<br>through two dollars a liter you can<br>really see about 5% of demand backs off<br>but the second time you go through two<br>dollars later because you do oscillate<br>then people are okay I've got used to it<br>a bit and then it becomes 220 and so on<br>so for there to be a material change in<br>consumers behavior in New Zealand the<br>carbon impact would have to be a heck of<br>a lot more than 33 cents given that we<br>typically cycle through maybe fifteen to<br>twenty cents from top to bottom as you<br>go through any particular year this is<br>the US which is the the foundation of<br>all these free markets is some really<br>weird stuff happening over there they've<br>recently it has always happened in the<br>same week they brought in legislation<br>that said all new cars had to be at a<br>consumption rate of six litres per 100<br>kilometers down from the previous nine<br>which is like great it just brings them<br>into line with what had been in Europe<br>for many many years and at the same week<br>there were a couple of states in the<br>u.s. that started taxing electric<br>vehicles now I could be that those<br>electric vehicles are powered by coal<br>produced electricity so maybe that's a<br>good thing to do but again you think<br>there's sort of really odd that the<br>signals that the regulator the<br>government are sending to the market are<br>causing causing confusion we want lower<br>fuel consumption but actually we're now<br>going to make it harder for you<br>economically to get into using your<br>electric vehicle and clearly there's in<br>consistency across New Zealand<br>governments yeah when I came back to New<br>Zealand I I think just after the<br>government changed their the previous<br>Labour government had put a mandate in<br>place for our biofuels is said to the<br>industry whatever you sell five percent<br>of it has come from a biofuel so it's a<br>bit of a club but it's one way to get<br>change and then before they had barely<br>had time for the ink to dry the National<br>gum<br>came in and see we're going to put a<br>biodiesel incentive in place so no<br>mandate but if you want to get after it<br>will pay you an incentive to do that so<br>a lot of projects had stalled between<br>government changes so some projects go<br>to start up the government then set up<br>no one's access the biodiesel grant<br>therefore clearly there's no need for it<br>so we're going to stop it completely so<br>it's like we got to go that way now then<br>you got to go that way now that ways<br>even stopped as well so the whole point<br>about this thing here is that all<br>businesses really want or through the<br>eye as a business leader really want<br>there's just a certain degree of way a<br>reasonable degree of certainty across a<br>reasonable degree of time because<br>whether it's your favorable to me or<br>unfavorable it enables me and my team to<br>make good decisions for us to bring our<br>talents and skills to bear on whatever<br>the regime is that we have to work<br>within but it's a certainty that I think<br>is really important so one of the<br>disappointing things about the move to<br>alternatives to fossil fuels is that<br>it's subject to this is certainly in New<br>Zealand this government change now I<br>have to hear that phrase you know<br>bipartisan politics particularly out of<br>the u.s. well why can't you know the<br>government's in New Zealand the big<br>decision makers in and get some<br>agreement on how we could deal with this<br>that would span more than the three-year<br>election cycle so it's not particularly<br>flesh in terms of yo market impetus to<br>change things if I talked a little bit<br>about Shaolin it's going to show a<br>couple of quick slides here I happen to<br>I speak at a conference a couple of<br>months ago I think you might even in<br>February and John love head from the UK<br>Energy Research Council put this map up<br>and that's a map of the black shale<br>deposits in the UK so again were a lot<br>of people think about shale oil and gas<br>as being a an American phenomena it's<br>happened more there because they not<br>only found the stuff but they had an<br>existing pipeline of gas and oil<br>pipelines to move it around the country<br>really quickly the UK has some of that<br>but you know that looks like a<br>reasonable chunk of the UK when you<br>could go off and do your own shale<br>exploration and production and here's a<br>bit of data around the u.s. the first<br>figure there is just what they call the<br>five states of Oklahoma North Dakota<br>that sort of cluster in America and<br>you'll see how yo oil has declined and<br>then in very recent times through shale<br>oil and gas exploration<br>how has gone up through the roof and the<br>bottom graph just really shows you<br>what's really happening around our crude<br>products and important see here that the<br>u.s. is now importing is as little or as<br>much depending on your perspective as<br>they were back in the mid 80s and so<br>we're only a couple of years you just<br>follow that graph that's why maybe why<br>by 2015 they are not importing anything<br>so that's really hard evidence of<br>actually what's physically happening in<br>markets and again I say whether you like<br>fracking you don't like fracking and all<br>the issues around it and there are<br>clearly some issues around it the<br>physical markets are fundamentally<br>changing and so that's why I'm not a<br>believer of peak oil and and i think<br>that the price point pressure towards<br>the Turner's the fossil fuels is just<br>not this is not going to be there okay<br>in the u.s. today it costs about<br>forty-five to fifty dollars a barrel to<br>extract shale oil and gas there's<br>there's people who whose opinion I<br>really value who suggest it will be down<br>to twenty-five dollars in the next five<br>years just through breakthroughs and<br>technology so you majan what that could<br>do in terms of people rushing to produce<br>even more of the stuff so not it's not a<br>favorable environment really is it for<br>for the supply side of the equation to<br>cause some shift in the demand side so<br>we move on to something now even more<br>positive I was he friends so believe it<br>or not I mean kuba kuba PD and South<br>Australia most people know it as an<br>oil-producing area this company link<br>energy and I mean I had to dig to find<br>this actually they've had a discovery<br>that could be anywhere between three and<br>a half billion barrels of oil and 233<br>billion barrels of oil the size almost<br>of Saudi Arabia now they're currently in<br>the market looking for about 150 to 300<br>million dollars to fund the next round<br>of exploration to really prove out<br>whether it's three and a half billion or<br>233 but in you can imagine what that<br>does the Australians don't think twice<br>about digging out their country and and<br>monetizing minerals so you just really<br>want to share those two with you to let<br>you know the whole shower oil and gas<br>thing is much more than an American<br>phenomena and as I said I mean it is<br>absolutely huge and it's got no air time<br>here at all I see are made of mind<br>to be saying do you realize and do you<br>want to participate so actually no we<br>are that's not what zeal is all about<br>but gee I find that really interesting<br>in terms of what it may mean for New<br>Zealand talking about that the practical<br>steps that we are taking because clearly<br>I painted a relatively do me and gloomy<br>situation so there's no there's no real<br>pressure on me from a supply side to do<br>anything about this but there are some<br>practical steps that we're taking so<br>we're currently in looking at a tallow<br>to diesel project and this is where we<br>take an edible animal fats so you're<br>that what's left over from dead cows and<br>what's typically at the moment gets<br>exported to China for the use of making<br>candles and soaps but actually there's a<br>technology that's available in New<br>Zealand and it's a common technology but<br>there's a variant of it that's that's<br>pretty unique in New Zealand and so<br>we've got the IP now that enables us to<br>take that that animal fat and turn it<br>into a very high quality biodiesel so we<br>can build a plant and we would make<br>about 20 million litres of biodiesel a<br>year or what's called be 100 so a<br>100-percent biofuel and we would then<br>blend that into diesel at about a five<br>percent and that will enable us to<br>supply about two-thirds of our service<br>stations across the North Island and a<br>number of our commercial customers it's<br>a very small step but actually you well<br>worth it i cost about 20 million dollars<br>about 15 million to build the plant and<br>about five million dollars to actually<br>upgrade our supply chain to be able to<br>protect that product and blend it and<br>blend it in so that's not a lot of money<br>yeah we're over one yeah we got 1.3 odd<br>billion dollars with assets we spend<br>this year about 100 million dollars with<br>the capital so 20 million isn't a heck<br>of a lot really sad thing is it doesn't<br>make any money so and actually it's<br>quite hard to predict yo in the classic<br>NPV or internal rate of return since<br>yeah what's it worth so we do that's<br>clever stuff called Monte Carlo analysis<br>where you take all the potential<br>variables and you model them and you<br>tumble them a thousand times so you take<br>the extreme of the crude price top and<br>bottom the extreme of diesel price top<br>and bottom the extreme of tallow price<br>top and bottom you come up with a<br>thousand combinations you put it in a<br>big computer 1 the handle and out the<br>bottom comes the answer that says we<br>have a sixty percent chance of losing<br>money<br>so what do you do if you know consumers<br>aren't prepared to pay a premium for<br>this product if you know there's a<br>compelling reason to do it from an<br>environmental and PAP's even a social<br>perspective but economically it's an<br>absolute bust so what you do is you try<br>to change the paradigm and you don't do<br>that in the way that fools yourself but<br>part of the way that I relate to it and<br>we'll make a decision on this project by<br>December so we actually just finding and<br>finalizing the engineering work right<br>now to know whether it will cost 20<br>million dollars or even more but i<br>probably wouldn't think twice about<br>spending 20 million dollars on a<br>marketing program over a five or six<br>year period actual fact we spend about<br>20 million dollars a year on our<br>marketing programs so perhaps one way to<br>relate to this is to say this is about<br>building a brand it's about pioneering a<br>technology it's about proving out<br>something in our supply chain ahead of<br>when a more economical turn ative might<br>come along so sometimes you know<br>business leaders and boards relate to<br>capital as being different to marketing<br>budgets I mean it's all just cash at the<br>end of the day and there's a different<br>accounting treatment i'll concede that<br>but again there's the whole notion of<br>changing the paradigm now I wouldn't<br>want you to hear that as being as loose<br>as a goose on money or we don't really<br>care about this stuff or another<br>incarnation of solid Energy not that at<br>all I'm all I'm doing is saying that we<br>have a natural reason for being in this<br>market there's more at stake here than<br>just the economics and how can we frame<br>it in a way that doesn't make us a<br>responsible as business leaders but<br>actually gets us into the game so we'll<br>have something to say about that<br>probably early in the new year the<br>second thing we're doing is we're<br>partnered with norske Skog and what we<br>are very cleverly call our stump to pump<br>strategy and this is where we take woody<br>biomass so sawdust and and waste on the<br>forest floor and we put it through a<br>very clever technology you squeeze it<br>really hard you apply a whole lot of<br>heat to it and at the back end of that<br>comes either a a feedstock that you<br>could take up and put into the refinery<br>so it like a green crude if I could use<br>that expression or you treat it a little<br>bit more and you turn it into a diesel<br>or even maybe at some type of petrol at<br>the plant we're very generously<br>supported by a government grant around<br>that primary growth partnership grants<br>that didn't come to us as the oil<br>industry it went to norske<br>in terms of trying to actually do<br>something in the forest space which is<br>clearly quite an important industry for<br>New Zealand and so between the<br>government grant norsk in ourselves were<br>spending 13 million dollars undertaking<br>a commercial and technical feasibility<br>study that will complete in about a<br>year's time about whether or not we<br>should go ahead with the project and<br>going here with the 30 million dollars<br>in itself is a lot of money because if<br>you do decide to go ahead it might cost<br>anywhere between 80 to 100 million<br>dollars to build the plant but the<br>really cool thing here is not only do<br>you get the a the cleaner products in<br>terms of what we sell at the back end<br>but you really start to deliver some<br>significant social outcomes and other<br>enviro comes so you imagine and summits<br>this is all still being scoped but<br>perhaps if this really did become<br>commercially and technically feasible<br>you could maybe build about 10 plants<br>around New Zealand like this that would<br>maybe substitute ten percent of the<br>crude that we important in New Zealand<br>so as a profound effect on balance of<br>payments and all that sort of stuff<br>probably helps the exporters kezia we're<br>not shipping so much stuff or buying so<br>much stuff into the country but equally<br>you mentioned what it's like to a town<br>like Colorado which for years and years<br>has had a declining commercial basis<br>that is the mill you know the pulp and<br>paper side of the business has been<br>shrieking shrinking and credibly that if<br>you start to build these plants in car<br>Widow husband etc places that have been<br>shrinking you can start to really<br>deliver different sorts of social<br>outcomes as well so again I think if you<br>think about those gears as much as I<br>talked about those gears being available<br>for change equally they can be available<br>for generating benefits for New Zealand<br>so that's what we're into as well that<br>is a long term thing as I said we'll do<br>the study and if it takes off it might<br>take us three or two or three years to<br>build the plant and you know you might<br>be another decade or wall before New<br>Zealand has your more than one plant<br>even if we get to the point of making<br>the decision to build the first one so<br>that's what it's that's<br>second-generation biofuels and part the<br>reason why that's a bit tricky it's a<br>little bit like the debate between VHS<br>and beta I look around the room probably<br>half you don't even know what I'm<br>talking about oh yeah like old people's<br>technology when we used to do things on<br>videotapes and so there is a lot of<br>technology out there around how you<br>can't convert these these waste<br>materials into a bio product but<br>actually yeah we want to be carefully<br>picked the winner<br>we want to make sure we get in the VHS<br>route rather than go to build a better<br>plant and eventually it dies out because<br>it was a better plant as opposed to it<br>was a great idea we just applied the<br>wrong technology and because we got the<br>big challenges you know as I mentioned<br>earlier no government mandate or<br>incentive there's no consumer pull for<br>it people won't pay a premium for it<br>I've got be responsible as a business<br>leader in terms of the economic outcomes<br>I have to deliver to my shareholders and<br>now I don't I don't just have to I've<br>got you know thousands of shareholders<br>that I have to make sure that I'm<br>responsible for and the economics on<br>this stuff are really really poor below<br>one hundred dollars a barrel and I've<br>spent part of my time with you tonight<br>tell me about why it's not going to be a<br>hundred dollars a barrel anymore yes<br>again it's a bust but part of the reason<br>why we want to provide thought<br>leadership and take advantage of being<br>invited to forums like this is to let<br>people know that we're open for business<br>in the space that we don't know how to<br>get a lot of things done and we very<br>much like to work with innovators<br>technologists venture capital people<br>protagonists NGOs people who care<br>consumers I mean so the list goes on<br>we'd very much like to work with a wide<br>diversity of people because I believe<br>that that diversity might open up our<br>way through this stuff because it won't<br>be as simple as just you know put the<br>numbers in a discounted cash flow and<br>that will give you the answer there's a<br>lot more at stake here an example of how<br>we're reducing the use of fossil fuels<br>and this is this is really really clever<br>stuff we've got people who consult on<br>how to help companies run their trucking<br>fleet we've got technology that enables<br>us to monitor what drivers are doing and<br>we can go out there and package that up<br>on a web-based service that gives all<br>captures all the data through the stuff<br>called telematics which is a fancy way<br>of saying the GPS in your car and modal<br>is what truck drivers do and there's<br>some amazing stuff that we've already<br>uncovered around this we've got 12<br>pilots underway at the moment and in<br>some cases we went again when you go<br>along to your customers and say please<br>can i partner with you because I want to<br>find you a way to use this of my<br>products so you know when to come you<br>didn't were truck drivers once you get<br>past the invective that comes screaming<br>back at you you think at a so now but<br>I'm serious so in some cases we've gone<br>to customers and we've we've not only<br>indicated how much we can save them<br>we've underwritten it we said we think<br>we can save you two<br>two thousand dollars a year in fuel and<br>if we don't deliver on that will write<br>you a check for the difference but what<br>we'd like you to do is pass more per<br>liter because we're going to save you so<br>much of your consumption so in case you<br>got to go out then you go to put a<br>guarantee underneath it to get people<br>into the game might you've got enough<br>people into the game then you've got<br>more data more empirical evidence that<br>you can that you can call upon so at 12<br>pilots underway at the moment and<br>there's some fascinating stuff I do you<br>realize that for every ten kilometers<br>are now and you drive if you're on the<br>open road extra ten kilometers an hour<br>you drive you consume ten percent more<br>fuel so every extra 10 kilometres<br>consumes team percent more fuel there's<br>wow there's one particular experience we<br>had where we've we've discovered that<br>this one particular truck driver was<br>consuming thirty one percent more fuel<br>than he needed to because of hash<br>breaking stop-start stop-start yo<br>driving much more aggressively than it<br>needed to so again one of the benefits<br>of this when you get people to use this<br>of your products as they drive safer and<br>again you lead to some superior social<br>outcomes so this is this is a really<br>really cool cool stuff here we've got a<br>we participated the sustainability<br>business showcase it happens down at the<br>cloud every October I think a couple of<br>weeks time we're down there again and<br>we've got this piece of kit it's an eco<br>driving simulator and you get in there<br>and it teaches you through six videos<br>how to drive how to improve your driver<br>behavior and you learn twelve driving<br>techniques and it will enable people to<br>change your behavior and reduce the use<br>of our products so again really really<br>good stuff we have a couple of<br>challenges around that I wonders if you<br>go out to New Zealanders and tell them<br>particularly consumers and say look I<br>found a way for you to do use this in my<br>products but you have to do this you<br>sound very much like nanny state and the<br>size of the shower head and all that<br>sort of stuff so that doesn't get you<br>too far so we're trying to find a way to<br>think actually what's the gamification<br>that we can bring to this because Kiwis<br>love to compete against themselves<br>against their mates against some<br>benchmark so trying to find a way to<br>take the behavior change that we need<br>turn it into a game and maybe that's how<br>we get to where we get to so that's the<br>first challenge is how do you get<br>consumers into this in a way that<br>doesn't sound like nanny state then the<br>second thing which is much more profound<br>for me<br>how do I do this in a way with both my<br>commercial customers and my consumers<br>that having taught them and got them to<br>use less of our products and pay me a<br>slight premium for it they then don't<br>say thanks Mike now I'm going to go<br>across town to the other guys it didn't<br>teach me that because they're going to<br>sell it to be cheaper anyway so there's<br>a competitive aspect to this as well<br>again that's what I mean this is where<br>we're stuck we know we can do this stuff<br>we know it would help but G we could be<br>competitively disadvantaged should we<br>really do that or not but some very very<br>good stuff that we're doing here we<br>found one guy in in Southland and<br>summertime who ran his truck all day<br>long right he'd he'd go to work he was<br>part of a contracting company to go to<br>work pack the truck up all day long and<br>leave the truck running because it was a<br>was a chilly boom you're right he didn't<br>want two sandwiches to curl up so he<br>kept the air conditioning on in the<br>truck all day long I tell you what the<br>fleet manager didn't know about that<br>because he'd been doing it for years and<br>years and years there was no change<br>there's no increase in consumption but<br>when you put this clever stuff in there<br>and you have consultants and you in your<br>web based the whole thing it's all real<br>time then you get to start to make<br>better decisions about how to manage<br>your fleet so weird action around all<br>the stuff and it's all good value but as<br>I said we have to be responsible about<br>things and here's a here's a great way<br>to put it i think so even if we even if<br>we've got this completely wrong that<br>there is no such thing as climate change<br>and and we don't need to work our way<br>away from fossil fuels yeah as the<br>speech bubble says you know what if it's<br>a big hoax and we create a better world<br>for nothing so there is more on the go<br>here then just reducing carbon intensity<br>winning ourselves off fossil fuels<br>there's a bigger game that's available<br>to us but that's still in that paradigm<br>called I've got yeah I on my team have<br>to run a good business we have to be<br>responsible to our shareholders and we<br>have to be economically sustainable so<br>it's pointless us being socially and<br>environmentally sustainable if we're not<br>economically sustainable because that<br>means it won't be here in the long term<br>to really take whatever steps are needed<br>to go beyond where we are today so thank<br>you very much for your time<br>you</p></main><footer
