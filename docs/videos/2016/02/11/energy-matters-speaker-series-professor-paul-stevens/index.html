very much for that<br>introduction I wish my parents had been<br>here my father would have been proud and<br>my mother would have believed you I'd<br>like to thank the energy center for the<br>invitation this is my first trip to New<br>Zealand and after four days I'm<br>determined it's not going to be my last<br>trip so it's been a very good<br>opportunity to come and tick one of the<br>things off my bucket list which was a<br>sort of visit to New Zealand below to do<br>it in six days is hardly doing it<br>justice the topic I want to talk about<br>despite the rather enigmatic title which<br>I promise I will explain is I really<br>want to talk about the prospects for oil<br>prices and in the process of this I'm<br>afraid I'm going to have to turn you all<br>into economists won't hurt very much<br>some of you may feel a little indecisive<br>for a few days afterwards but that will<br>that will that will eventually pass let<br>me just talk about the outline what I<br>want to do I want to start by talking a<br>bit about the context and talk about the<br>prospects for oil demand and the<br>prospects for supply and then when I<br>have a little bit of look at history and<br>in particular look at the changes to the<br>global oil market since the 1970s and<br>the logic for looking at the history<br>comes from a famous quote by otto von<br>bismarck who once said only a fool<br>learns from his mistakes i learn from<br>other people's mistakes and so if you<br>look at what went on in the past you<br>might have a chance of not repeating the<br>same sorts of errors I then want to<br>introduce you to something that I've<br>been calling opex dilemma which sets the<br>scene for the future level of prices and<br>the conclusion I come to and i'll give<br>you the conclusion straight away is the<br>oil market is in for a period of extreme<br>price volatility over the next 5 10 or<br>15 years and so I want to finish off and<br>this this is the bit that is rather<br>presumptuous of me having been here for<br>all<br>for days I want to look a little bit at<br>what the implications of this might be<br>four for New Zealand in the hope if<br>nothing else of starting a bit of a<br>discussion afterwards in terms of the<br>the Q&amp;A session so let me start then<br>with the prospects for oil demand this<br>is estimates from a number of sources<br>including the International Energy<br>Agency the NPC is their new policy<br>scenario the CPC is the current policy<br>scenario the energy information<br>administration of the United States at<br>sorry hyung doing the wrong thing here<br>and and BP and it's basically looking at<br>the prospects for growth of energy<br>consumption from twenty ten to twenty<br>thirty and as you can see in terms of<br>total energy the bulk of the increase in<br>energy demand is going to be coming from<br>the non-oecd countries what BP calls the<br>emerging market economies which is what<br>we used to call the developing world but<br>also the transition economies as well<br>and as you can see the the in terms of<br>total energy there is going to be an<br>increase in oil team and I don't think<br>anybody is going to to dispute that<br>however having said that let's look at a<br>little closer at the IAS estimates now<br>as I say this comes from the IAS new<br>policy scenario and it shows the<br>increase in oil demand from 2011 up to<br>twenty twenty and twenty thirty five now<br>what's interesting is of course OECD oil<br>demand is going to fall we have peak oil<br>nothing whatever to do with the peak oil<br>months and some geologists but peak oil<br>because people don't want it anymore in<br>the OECD so all of the growth is<br>basically coming from the non-oecd and<br>here the key of a mix you've heard of<br>the BRICS Brazil Russia India China<br>those of you following eurozone crisis<br>will have heard of the pigs portugal<br>island greece spain meet the mix mid<br>East India China and together they<br>account for sixty-eight percent of the<br>non-oecd growth in oil demand now there<br>are very few advantages to getting old<br>but there are two advantage one is you<br>can say I yes I remember I was there I<br>was involved in that and the other big<br>advantage is you collect stuff you<br>accumulate things and one of the things<br>I have accumulated is the first world<br>energy outlook that was published in<br>1977 by the OECD not the IEA the OECD<br>and this document is a very small thin<br>document consider any of you know the<br>current I ea's world energy outlook it's<br>sort of a four and that thick you drop<br>it on your foot you break your toes this<br>one was sort of about that size and<br>about that thick so it's more like a<br>pamphlet and in there they projected<br>what all demand was going to look like<br>in 1980 and 1985 and as you can see the<br>view was oil demand will go Rising<br>forever and ever and ever the actual<br>turnout was completely different that is<br>what they were projecting in 1985 in the<br>US Japan and the rest of OECD that's<br>largely order and the actual turnout was<br>a level of oil consumption that was way<br>below the level in 1974 and you ask<br>yourself the question why did they get<br>it so wrong what did they forget and of<br>course what they forgot was prices now<br>I'm proud of a number of things in my<br>life one of which is teaching my cap to<br>do a high five one of the others is this<br>slide which took me over a month to<br>actually put together and it shows you<br>for 12 developing countries now South<br>Korea of course is part of OECD but<br>we're looking here at the 1970s 1980s<br>these are 12 developing countries and<br>for each country I gather the final<br>price of the oil product so this is like<br>I turned it into an index are you<br>looking at an index of the weighted<br>average price of final oil products to<br>the consumer<br>so we all start together at the same<br>level in 1970 going along going along<br>the first oil shock of 1973 only three<br>countries passed on that higher price to<br>their consumers and that was Korea<br>argentina and brazil the rest of them<br>decided that they were going to<br>introduce subsidies rather than pass on<br>the higher prices the logic they said<br>what we don't want to hurt the poor that<br>was dishonest nonsense because the poor<br>wasn't weren't using oil products they<br>were frightened of the political<br>reaction if they started to increase<br>prices going along again the second oil<br>shark 79-80 and again this time only two<br>countries argentina and brazil oh sorry<br>korea and brazil passed on the higher<br>prices to their consumers so what well<br>the so what is in the next slide and<br>it's measuring the energy intensity is<br>commercial energy intensities in a<br>number of countries here we have the<br>OECD countries Japan Germany France UK<br>profligate United States with all the<br>energy that they use this is the amount<br>of energy is required to produce a<br>dollar of gdp it's not PPP basis I'll<br>have that argument with anybody who<br>wants it later on okay now remember the<br>three countries that passed on to their<br>final consumers the higher prices were<br>Brazil korea and argentina lo and behold<br>they have similar levels of energy<br>intensity to the countries that did pass<br>it on the countries that didn't pass it<br>on the countries that kept subsidies<br>have very high energy intensities indeed<br>now this is a simplistic argument<br>there's a lot of other things going on<br>there but the point I'm trying to make<br>here is the prices do matter prices make<br>a difference and the significance of the<br>mix are sixty-eight percent of the<br>non-oecd oil demand growth is that in<br>all cases they've had highly subsidized<br>prices to their final consumers that has<br>finished in India or it's finishing in<br>India starting in 2002 it's finished in<br>China at the start of 2009 in other<br>words in both countries<br>higher prices are being passed on to<br>their final consumers in the Middle East<br>are talking about it but now is not a<br>particularly good time to increase<br>energy prices because of political<br>problems but nonetheless what I'm saying<br>here is that a lot of the conventional<br>views of future oil demand are making<br>the same mistake the IEA made in the<br>1970s they're neglecting the price<br>impact so I'm suggesting that the growth<br>in oil demand is going to be less than a<br>lot of the conventional wisdom suggests<br>now don't get me wrong I'm not saying<br>that Chinese oil demand is going to<br>disappear clearly it's not it will<br>continue to grow but I suspect not at<br>the sort of levels that a lot of people<br>are expecting so the future of oil<br>demand basically is uncertain is the<br>first message I want to leave you with<br>what about supply what are the prospects<br>for oil supply well this is estimates of<br>conventional oil is rare done<br>conventionally as blue these are<br>estimates of proven reserves proven<br>reserves are defined as oil that will be<br>produced given current economics and<br>technology and as you can see it looks<br>like this now this is a pretty useless<br>slide it reminds me of the story of<br>George W Bush being briefed by Rumsfeld<br>on the situation in Iraq at the end of<br>the briefing he said oh by the way mr.<br>president I think I should tell you that<br>yesterday three Brazilian soldiers were<br>killed in Baghdad and George said 03 /<br>oh that's terrible how many are in a<br>Brazilian million billion trillion<br>Brazilian okay think about it large<br>indeterminate number so what we have<br>here is Brazilians of battles it doesn't<br>really tell you anything at all so what<br>we need to do is to say well how does<br>that pan out in terms of how much is<br>actually being used and to do that one<br>tool is the reserve production ratio so<br>you take the estimate of reserves you<br>take the production in any year and that<br>gives you the life of the of the<br>reserves and as you can see for oil it's<br>about 56 years for gas 57 years for cold<br>it's over a hundred years now you have<br>to be<br>with this number as well it can be a<br>pretty useless number if you do the<br>arithmetic and I've done the arithmetic<br>and take the results of the sort of<br>nearest you know to a lot of decimal<br>points you find out the oil runs out in<br>20 65 on the twenty-sixth of January at<br>0 8 55 gmt I'm glad you laughed because<br>it illustrates what a stupid number it<br>is you can imagine the nine o'clock news<br>guy saying I've just been handed a piece<br>of paper that says the oils run out i<br>wonder how I'm going to get home okay<br>it's much more complicated than that but<br>the issue from the supply side really is<br>not so much the resource space we know<br>that is huge it's a question about the<br>willingness and ability of the operators<br>to invest in and produce that or oil and<br>this is the key issue now before the<br>1970s the Seven Sisters dominated now<br>for those of you are not familiar with<br>the term the term Seven Sisters was a<br>term almost an abusive term invented by<br>a guy called n Rico Matai in the 1950s<br>who was head of Eni the Italian national<br>oil company and the Seven Sisters were<br>five American companies one British one<br>Anglo British and often CFP companies<br>won't say the patrol is included to make<br>up the majors the sort of only eight<br>sister now these companies today the<br>question arises are they willing to<br>invest and put the amount of money that<br>is needed in a world where their<br>financial strategy is based upon<br>value-based management now I don't get<br>into the technicalities of this but very<br>simply explained it says if you're a<br>company investing in a project if your<br>project can't earn at least as good a<br>return as other projects in the same<br>sector you should give the money back to<br>the shareholders and that is what the<br>big companies have been doing in droves<br>and it's quite interesting because<br>Bloomberg two days ago produced the<br>report that showed that the exxonmobil<br>several BP and she'll the remaining<br>seven sisters or were all announcing<br>increases in capex the only company that<br>was<br>bouncing a full a cutting capex was<br>total guess which company saw the<br>highest increase in its share price it<br>was total okay the shareholders don't<br>want the oil companies going out the<br>problem is they can't get access to the<br>low-cost reserves that's a another issue<br>now since the 1980s the six brothers<br>have dominated okay this is the other<br>bits of the other title so meet the six<br>brothers the six brothers are the six<br>national oil company is the dominate oil<br>production in the Gulf Saudi Aramco<br>Kuwait Petroleum Corporation abu dhabi<br>national oil company the Iraq national<br>oil company National Iranian oil company<br>and Qatar Petroleum what's the<br>significance of the six brothers well<br>again I'm going back to the I ea's new<br>policy scenario and they have said<br>basically between 2010 and 2035 the<br>world will need an increase in oil<br>production of a little over 13 million<br>barrels a day of that increase 91.2<br>percent is coming from the six brothers<br>that's such a frightening number i<br>checked the arithmetic about ten times<br>this raises the issue then about the<br>willingness and the ability of the six<br>brothers to convert their resources<br>their reserves into battles of oil not<br>interested in battles of oil were<br>interested in battles of gasoline or gas<br>oil or whatever you want to think of it<br>into above the ground resources the<br>willingness concerns the depletion<br>policy issue 40 years and two weeks ago<br>on the sixteenth of October 1973 was the<br>first oil shock two weeks before that I<br>rocked up in Beirut to start my first<br>job as an assistant professor of<br>economics at the American University of<br>Beirut the timing was perfect because I<br>was the old<br>academic economists in the region<br>outside of the oil companies who knew<br>anything about the international oil<br>business because all my postgraduate<br>work had been done on oil so I spent a<br>very interesting two or three years<br>going round the capitals of the oil<br>producers of the region talking to the<br>policymakers and they used to say to me<br>you know Paul we thought about this a<br>lot and we've come to the conclusion<br>that oil in the ground is worth more<br>than money in the bank in other words<br>we're going to leave it in the ground<br>because it's going to be worth more in<br>the future now over the last few years I<br>go back to the Gulf a great deal again<br>I've been going around the ministry is<br>talking to the policymakers some of them<br>are still the same policy makers that<br>were there so many years ago and they've<br>got more sophisticated now and they say<br>you know Paul oil in the ground is worth<br>more than money in the bank if the bank<br>has subprime mortgage assets in other<br>words why produce the oil give it to<br>these institutions we don't really know<br>what the hell is going on what about the<br>ability of these companies well the<br>record is mixed I've just finished a<br>major study that has been done by<br>Stanford University funded actually buy<br>BP looking at national oil companies I<br>commend it to you if you're interested<br>in national oil companies and the<br>conclusion we came to was that in terms<br>of the six brothers Saudi Aramco is an<br>excellent company in terms of its<br>technical engineering ability at his<br>first race add knockin katha are okay<br>but three of them kpc nioc and ina a<br>disasters not the fault of the people<br>running them it's the fault of the<br>political system that they're operating<br>in and I look at this sort of a thing<br>here and I think to myself mmm time to<br>think about buying an electric car so<br>what I'm saying is the supply side is<br>significantly uncertain okay little bit<br>of history global oil market since the<br>1970s before the 1970s the market was<br>dominated by the Seven Sisters plus c FP<br>and these companies were all<br>operationally vertically integrated<br>economists love jargon the reason we<br>love jargon is because if you use a lot<br>of it somebody has to pay you large sum<br>of money to interpret the jargon and the<br>priests and the lawyers got there before<br>the economist's but we're trying to<br>catch up on this now all that means is<br>an operationally vertically integrated<br>company is the company has oil fields<br>refineries marketing distribution<br>networks their oil goes from their<br>fields to their refineries the refinery<br>supply their products their marketing a<br>distribution network now if you think<br>about that these are all in through<br>affiliate transactions that ain't no<br>price ok the price is effectively the<br>figment of some accountants imagination<br>as a transfer price from your oil field<br>to your refinery to your marketing and<br>distribution network and the result of<br>this was that you have to have some sort<br>of price to determine tax and so the<br>industry introduced posted prices this<br>was a tax reference price now what this<br>means is the oil price was effectively<br>an administered price and it was<br>determined because a group of men in her<br>room politically incorrect but<br>historically Acuras a group of men in a<br>room set a number and providing those<br>outside the room the refiners believed<br>in the number that was the oil price it<br>really was it sounds ridiculous but that<br>was how the oil price was determined now<br>before the 1970s the men in the room<br>were from the Seven Sisters and guess<br>what the guys outside the room the<br>refiners were from the Seven Sisters<br>what a lovely system do you like the<br>price I loved the price deal ok and it's<br>not for nothing that this was called the<br>Golden Age of the oil industry gives you<br>an idea of who writes they the sort of<br>the history of these things now in the<br>nice since 1950 what I'm saying is the<br>companies could have had any price they<br>wanted they actually chose to say a<br>relatively low number it's interesting<br>to us why well the answer was first of<br>all they<br>frightened of competition from other<br>energy sources the thing that kept the<br>CEOs of the Seven Sisters awake at night<br>in the 50s and 60s was nuclear so cheap<br>we won't have to meter it they felt if<br>they push the price of oil too high then<br>the demand for oil in generation and in<br>the 1960s the increase in electricity<br>generation was fueled almost entirely by<br>oil the choices were oil oil or oil then<br>if they put the price too high this<br>could this could stop us the other thing<br>they referred frightened about is that<br>the OECD countries were going through<br>their so-called economic miracle growing<br>eight ten percent per year this was<br>based upon cheap energy if the companies<br>had started to get greedy then the US<br>and he trusts people British government<br>friends would have come down on them<br>like a ton of bricks so they were<br>relatively moderate and if you look at<br>the history of oil prices this is in<br>real terms so it's in twenty twelve<br>dollars here's World War two the end of<br>World War two in 1946 as you can see up<br>to the early 70s the real price of oil<br>was falling and was quite low then of<br>course things change 1970 a young man in<br>the uniform of a colonel of the Libyan<br>army walked into a room where the oil<br>company men were talking about what<br>number they were going to say and said<br>hang on a minute guys we want to say in<br>this this was the sort of start of the<br>first oil crisis and the result was that<br>the government's and the company's sat<br>in the same room and said a number and<br>in October 1973 the Arab OPEC members<br>and the Iranians bit of poetic license<br>here suddenly looked at each other and<br>said hey guys women in a room why do we<br>need the oil company people it's our oil<br>will say a number and on the sixteenth<br>of October they did and that was the<br>first oil shock the International price<br>of oil quadrupled with the following<br>meeting in Tehran in December about four<br>times<br>and you can see that here that's the<br>first oil shock then 79 80 the second<br>oil shock so how is the oil market<br>different today it's very different the<br>first point is the market is now<br>dominated by the six brothers they are<br>the main players the oil price is now a<br>market price based upon spot prices<br>fifty sixty seventy percent of the<br>world's oil is priced off Brent or a<br>Brent blend however the men in the room<br>is still relevant but the men in the<br>room are now the OPEC governments and<br>they say a number but the number they<br>say is not a price the number they say<br>is a production level not a price so<br>those are the men in the room who's<br>outside the room well you still have the<br>refiners operating in what I will call<br>the wet battle market were real people<br>buy real black sticky barrels of oil and<br>sell black sticky barrels of crude oil<br>okay so they're the same not dominated<br>by the majors in the way they were in<br>the 60s because refining is a lousy<br>business to be in and the majors have<br>been desperately trying to get out of it<br>and give all these horrible loss making<br>things to somebody else however there is<br>a new set of players and this is what I<br>will call the paper battle markets this<br>is the market where people exchange<br>promises to buy or to sell written on<br>bits of paper but talking of course<br>about nymex in New York v IC e in London<br>futures markets now what are the<br>linkages between the two markets<br>essentially the linkage has to do with<br>perceptions so if you are in the wet<br>battle market and you're negotiating to<br>buy or sell a battle of oil you have to<br>write the contract one of the things you<br>need to put in the contract is the price<br>so you start a negotiation you have to<br>start the negotiation from somewhere and<br>so you look at what the price in the<br>paper battle market is and<br>you start your negotiation from there<br>now be clear what I'm saying I'm not<br>saying the paper battle market sets that<br>the price of oil in the wet battle<br>market but it certainly influences it<br>very strongly equally if you're<br>operating in the paper battle market and<br>the main the most important operators<br>that are what I call money managers the<br>days of speculators are sort of the term<br>speculators doesn't have any meaning<br>anymore in this context the money<br>managers for people managing very large<br>portfolios of assets these are the<br>people looking after my pension least I<br>hope looking after my pension and<br>they've got a portfolio that ranges from<br>the very safe and secure Treasury bonds<br>through stocks shares equities into<br>commodities so they look at commodities<br>and regarded as an asset class and<br>they're always looking thinking well<br>what's going to happen in the wet battle<br>market is that a surplus of oil a<br>shortage of oil is the price going to go<br>up or going to go down I need to have a<br>view on this so I can take a position to<br>make money so one influences perceptions<br>about surface and shortage and the other<br>signals what price might be now what<br>this means is price determination now is<br>doubly complicated and uncertain in the<br>good old days the men in the room said a<br>number with a dollar sign in front and<br>if people believe that that was the<br>price very predictable today however the<br>first thing is the men outside the room<br>have to believe the production number<br>and secondly assuming they believe the<br>production number they then have to<br>decide how is it going to affect price<br>this is where it starts to get<br>complicated believing the production<br>number is difficult the market data on<br>supply and demand are absolutely awful<br>we have no idea what world oil<br>consumption was last year or in 2012 or<br>in 2011 why how do I know it's bad<br>because it keeps getting revised you<br>only have to go and look at BP stats<br>review and compare year-on-year to see<br>how the numbers change is more in<br>information comes in so supply and<br>demand a very poor this is why one of<br>the first things the International<br>Energy Forum did when it set up its<br>secretary I think of the ad was to<br>introduce something called Jody was then<br>called the joint oil data initiative to<br>try and improve the quality of data if<br>you think supply and demand days are bad<br>the inventory stock data is ten times<br>worse okay we really haven't got a clue<br>only the OECD comes out with numbers we<br>know that there's a lot of stock<br>building going on in Asia but if anybody<br>tells you they probably have to kill you<br>because it's all state secret stuff and<br>of course even if the data was perfect<br>we know OPEC cheat so they'll say the<br>number in the room and then go out and<br>do something completely different added<br>to that uncertainty is then okay let's<br>suppose you believe the number how is<br>that going to translate into a price and<br>here we have a serious problem there is<br>frequently a disconnect between<br>perceptions in the paper battle market<br>and the reality in the wet battle market<br>and the disconnect arises because the<br>money managers don't understand the oil<br>industry they don't need to understand<br>the oil industry they're not in the<br>business of doing that all they need to<br>do is to to quote the famous phrase of<br>John Maynard Keynes on this is they have<br>to anticipate what the average opinion<br>of the average opinion is likely to be<br>they need to try and outguess what the<br>market is doing this may sound a bit<br>strange and it did to me for I put this<br>view forward I also felt a bit<br>embarrassed got it implied i was saying<br>these guys are stupid and they're not<br>very smart there's certainly richer than<br>I am anyway I was giving this lecture in<br>Oxford a couple of years ago and one of<br>the professors of economic said to me<br>afterwards do you any done any work on<br>foreign exchange markets I said no he<br>said what you're describing in the oil<br>market is what we've been looking at in<br>foreign exchange markets for you we call<br>it scapegoat three theory and it<br>basically said if you're a Western<br>trained economists trying to predict<br>exchange rates and you look at the sort<br>of metrics that a Western trend<br>economists would look at it will get you<br>nowhere because the guys<br>seeing the foreign exchange rates the<br>traders are looking at a totally<br>different set of numbers and different<br>set of metrics so it's not as wild as it<br>sounds what happens when they realize<br>they've got it wrong is you get a rapid<br>and dramatic adjustment and you can see<br>here this is the monthly price of oil<br>this century from 2000 it's the OPEC<br>basket and you can see on a number of<br>occasions when the moneymen realize<br>they've got it wrong they pull out the<br>market and the price goes down my<br>favorite example for reasons I'll<br>explain happened at the end of 2006 when<br>they were pushing the price up and up<br>and up and i was going round the city of<br>london talking to the money managers i<br>had one meeting with them and i said why<br>are you pushing the price up and they<br>said because the shorties royal so how<br>did you know there's a shortage of oil<br>and they said because the price is going<br>and they didn't they didn't smile there<br>was this was dead true in other words of<br>course of the shortage the price is<br>going up and everything we do is pushing<br>the price up so that's a bit of<br>background let me now turn to OPEC's<br>dilemma and explain what it is it starts<br>as a legacy of the Arab uprisings the<br>kicked off into this year at the<br>beginning of 2011 it spread very rapidly<br>too many parts of the rest of the region<br>Middle East and North Africa and<br>producer government suddenly realized<br>they had a major problem on the hands<br>and what they have to do to solve that<br>problem was to throw money at it and<br>they had to throw money at it big time<br>to try and keep people off the streets a<br>good example here in Saudi Arabia the<br>blue line shows you the number of Saudi<br>nationals employed in the Saudi<br>government sector and the red line is an<br>estimate of Saudi current expenditure<br>and both are rising dramatically because<br>in the last few years every time the<br>King goes abroad and comes home he<br>invites his people to benefit from in<br>2011<br>firstly was 37 billion dollar handouts<br>two months later at 93 billion dollar<br>handouts which involved dramatic<br>increases in public sector pay that's<br>fine and dandy the only problem is you<br>got to pay for it which means<br>effectively the supply price has gone up<br>estimates suggest that in 2008 Saudi<br>needed fifty dollars a barrel to be able<br>to pacify its population the estimate<br>for 2012 was ninety-four dollars a<br>battle and you can see here estimates<br>for some of the other OPEC countries as<br>well Saudi Arabia is the green bar the<br>average weighted average for OPEC was<br>104 dollars a battle so what well they<br>can get the higher prices and live<br>happily ever after but and this is a big<br>bus higher prices will lead to demand<br>destruction meet the mix again alright<br>remember the mix sixty-eight percent of<br>the increase in oil demand is coming<br>from there look at what's happened to<br>price since 2002 the world oil price has<br>been with a bit of a hiccup here but has<br>been as been rising dramatically that is<br>going to kick in an effect demand<br>particularly now that the big consumers<br>like India and China are passing on<br>these higher prices to their consumers<br>so you're going to start seeing demand<br>destruction at the same time you're<br>going to see more supply in particular<br>because of the technological legacy of<br>the shale gas revolution in the United<br>States the use of horizontal drilling<br>and fracking has meant that you're<br>seeing a dramatic increase in US<br>production not just in the US but<br>elsewhere in 2011 the joke amongst us<br>oil analysts was that the next member of<br>OPEC would be North Dakota at the end of<br>2011 North Dakota was producing more oil<br>in Ecuador and more oil and Qatar okay<br>in 2012 last year US oil production<br>increased by a million barrels a day<br>that's the biggest increase in the<br>history of the industry in the US since<br>it began in 1859 so<br>on the one hand this illustrates the<br>problem of opec's dilemma they need a<br>high price to survive politically but<br>that's going to lead to a market<br>reaction which we will need lower weaker<br>demand and higher supply that is<br>unsustainable you only need to do<br>economics 101 then though you can't have<br>a situation where if demand is going<br>down and suppliers going up you cannot<br>maintain high prices and so the question<br>then arises are we looking at a rerun of<br>the oil market from nineteen eighty to<br>eighty six and that resulted of course<br>in the nineteen eighty six price<br>collapse again you can see here this was<br>the second oil shock this is what I call<br>the third oil shock because it seems to<br>be natural justice if you call something<br>a shock because the consumers are hurt<br>if the producers are heard that also<br>deserves the title of the shock so what<br>are the similarities between 8286 81 to<br>86 and now first of all in that period<br>Saudi Arabia was acting as the swing<br>producer what that meant was Saudi<br>Arabia was manipulating its production<br>to absorb the error on the data and OPEC<br>cheating in order to get the price they<br>wanted the problem was the call it a<br>swing roll is a misuse of language<br>because instead of going up and down it<br>just went down so in 1980 Saudis<br>producing ten and a half million barrels<br>a day by the summer of 85 it was down to<br>two and a half million barrels a day and<br>it stopped doing it that led to the 86<br>price collapse now in the last 12 months<br>it's been clear to me although the<br>Saudis would vehemently deny it that<br>they have quietly resumed that swing<br>rule they are manipulating their<br>production in order to try and balance<br>the market to get the sort of price they<br>want again 81 286 new oil province is<br>lurking to come on stream but needed a<br>higher price the North Sea North Slope<br>Alaska a lot<br>non-opec countries we have the same<br>again today so with press a button<br>something happens we have the same again<br>today only now it is deep offshore and<br>it's unconventionals or both of which<br>need high prices to bring them on stream<br>and finally in the early 80s very<br>bullish outlook on oil demand which<br>ignored price effects already talked<br>about that we have the same thing again<br>today the forecasters are making the<br>similar sort of Arab that was made at<br>the in the 80s there are however some<br>differences and price determination now<br>as I've tried to explain it's much more<br>complicated than it was there then men<br>in the room said the number fine that<br>was the price now it's much more<br>difficult then there were no papers or<br>futures markets small gas oil futures<br>market in Chicago the beginnings of a<br>paper forward market in North Sea oil<br>but unregulated now of course you have<br>all-singing all-dancing futures markets<br>and that means the prices can move and<br>change much more quickly prices are<br>going to be much more volatile also then<br>the idea that there would be revolution<br>in the streets in the Middle East was<br>virtually unthinkable this might the<br>Iranian Revolution now there's much<br>greater threat of political unrest if<br>you get that that is going to spook the<br>markets so if the price does go down a<br>lot 86 and the government's can't get<br>the revenues and you're going to get<br>riots in the streets the prices are<br>going to shoot back up again also you<br>now have much greater divisions within<br>OPEC OPEC has always had problems always<br>been divided but since 2003 and the<br>American intervention in Iraq you now<br>have a much clearer a division between<br>Sunni and Shia in OPEC in a way that you<br>never had in the past so what<br>conclusions on future prices well I<br>think a lower price is very likely a<br>much lower price unfortunately I don't<br>know what the timing is if I did I could<br>make a great deal of money out of it the<br>reason I don't know what the timing is<br>because I don't know how long<br>Arabia is willing and able to play the<br>swing role how much wriggle room do they<br>have how much financial cushion do they<br>have that if they do need to start<br>bringing down their production they can<br>still meet their budgetary requirements<br>when the price falls as I say political<br>unrest in mena is likely to lead to a<br>price rebound written by the money<br>managers and of course lurking in the<br>background all the time in this<br>situation is the potential for more<br>geopolitical outages don't forget this<br>year we've lost a million barrels a day<br>from Libya 800,000 barrels a day from<br>Nigeria 300,000 barrels a day from<br>around 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq<br>that is quite a lot of loss now why<br>haven't we noticed much impact on price<br>because Saudi Arabia has turned the taps<br>of them while they're turning the taps<br>up that's okay but as these things come<br>back on and there are no more<br>geopolitical outages that Saudi has<br>reduced its production rice last couple<br>of slides and this is where I am<br>treading on very dangerous ground indeed<br>okay so I I ask your indulgence what are<br>the implication of oil price volatility<br>for a country like New Zealand let's<br>have a little look at the energy picture<br>here which I'm sure you're familiar with<br>that shows you a new zealand energy<br>consumption from 65 to 2012 and as you<br>can see oil is a pretty important part<br>of the story in 2012 it accounts for<br>about 36 35.5 percent of primary energy<br>consumption and and this is an important<br>point the vast majority of that in New<br>Zealand is in the transport sector the<br>significance of that of course is that<br>you have limited alternatives if you're<br>using oil to generate power or there's<br>other things you can use but if it's in<br>the transport sector then unless you're<br>going to start doing interesting things<br>with electric vehicles or CNG or other<br>things then you're stuck with that also<br>as well it's worth pointing out you have<br>a very large and other energy<br>consumption in New Zealand and that of<br>course is largely hydro a little bit of<br>wind and other<br>geothermal and biomass you know there<br>was essentially renewable energies so<br>what about the economic picture that is<br>a picture of New Zealand's balance of<br>trade as you can see the start of the<br>century in surplus in middle of the<br>century goes into deficit and then<br>towards the last few years it's gone<br>back into surplus again so whilst well<br>let's look at the net oil trade that's<br>the net petroleum imports for New<br>Zealand in other words it's significant<br>in terms of your potential balance of<br>payments now what's this got to do with<br>volatility well if you going to have oil<br>price volatility those blue bars are<br>going to look like yo-yos as they're<br>going up and down it's going to be very<br>difficult to have a sensible<br>macroeconomic strategy in that sort of<br>the world there's also the problem that<br>if you have volatile prices then this<br>inhibits investment investors don't like<br>volatile oil prices you are interested<br>in trying to develop right for good or<br>evil depending on which side of the<br>fence you're on oil and gas resources in<br>New Zealand if you're serious about that<br>and you're trying to get people to come<br>in and explore you're going to have to<br>remember that in a volatile price world<br>a lot of investors are going to be very<br>very uncertain about investing and in<br>particular you're going to be competing<br>for up stirring dollars with a lot of<br>other potential areas for investment<br>which means that if you are serious<br>about trying to develop the resources<br>you're going to need a fairly attractive<br>fiscal regime in order to attract those<br>upstream investment dollars competing<br>with other people thinking for example<br>if Iran manages to come to some sensible<br>deal with the United States the oil<br>companies will be like flies around a<br>honeypot in that particular one and<br>there's lots of other areas of the world<br>as well that are open there's another<br>point is well and<br>that is New Zealand and I go back to the<br>point about the advantage of you do a<br>lot of renewables which means you have a<br>lot of renewable technology which you<br>are in the position to then sell abroad<br>and an export earnings on it the problem<br>is in a volatile oil price world which<br>also by the way means a volatile gas<br>price world then there are question<br>marks about people's willingness to<br>invest in renewables and this could<br>again threaten it on that cheerful<br>little note i will stop thank you very<br>much indeed for your attention I hope<br>you got something out of it i'll be
