so it's just me for seven<br>minutes<br>my career to date is defined by the<br>history of neutrality a word for that<br>for most of you will conjure up pictures<br>of Switzerland and chocolate ski slopes<br>looted Nazi gold perhaps the Red Cross<br>but also blandness sorry if there any<br>Swiss in the audience non involvement of<br>sticking your head in the sand and<br>avoiding international attention or as<br>my TV heroine of the 1990s Ally McBeal<br>explained it and I quote everything is<br>neutral in Switzerland people are even<br>emotionally neutral in Switzerland all<br>they do is drink hot chocolate work in<br>banks nobody gets hurt and they get in<br>lead nice lives right up to the point<br>Neutrality today is often defined by<br>passivity and inaction and one of my<br>students rather daringly suggested in a<br>class that he didn't believe that<br>neutrality was a thing for how can a<br>state be uninvolved or uninterested in<br>the affairs of its neighbors and there's<br>the rub because of course it can't<br>no state exists in isolation from the<br>world or from its neighbors<br>the neutrality historically considered<br>was really a policy of state of<br>abstention ISM and non involvement<br>rather neutrals were countries to<br>declare their non-belligerent see at the<br>start of a war and in so doing they<br>promised to behave in certain ways that<br>promised not to provide military<br>assistance to any belligerent they<br>promised to protect their territorial<br>integrity and to a spouse of relative<br>degree of impartiality<br>in returned a neutral hoped and at some<br>times could reasonably expect<br>that its neutrality and its non<br>belligerency would be respected by<br>people<br>particularly in terms of its trade in<br>terms of access to the open seas almost<br>to go about its ordinary business as if<br>there was no war on<br>so before the 20th century before the<br>first and second world wars particularly<br>neutrality was not a policy reserved for<br>small weak states in fact during the<br>long 19th century that stretched from<br>1815 to 1914<br>neutrality was the most common foreign<br>policy option adopted by the great<br>powers when others went to war<br>so one of the ongoing tasks I have as a<br>historian is to revise people's<br>expectations of what it meant to be<br>neutral for it's not only in the popular<br>mind that neutrals are deemed irrelevant<br>most historians of warfare seem to think<br>so too or at least they don't ask<br>questions of neutrals very often and<br>neither do many political scientists and<br>I ask scholars although there are of<br>course some<br>so above all I spend a lot of my time<br>explaining that neutrality is complex<br>and evolving and it has been complex and<br>evolving since ancient times further<br>while I want to argue and I do argue<br>that without neutrality we can't really<br>understand the nature and scope of<br>international relations either today or<br>in the past<br>now I stumbled upon neutrality when I<br>was in PhD students at the University of<br>Canterbury I wanted to do something on<br>the Netherlands and war preferably the<br>Second World War because of course<br>that's the only war that has any<br>relevance today and my brilliant<br>supervisor Vincent orange suggested that<br>before I pursue this path I might write<br>him an essay five thousand word essay<br>out of the blue he gave me three weeks<br>on what the history of neutral are what<br>what the history of the Netherlands and<br>the first world war looked like because<br>according to him you can't understand<br>the second world war without<br>understanding the first so I did this<br>and I realized there was virtually<br>nothing written on the subject and<br>certainly nothing in it virtually<br>nothing in English<br>for unlike much of the rest of the world<br>the Dutch managed remain neutral the<br>Dutch state remain retained its<br>neutrality throughout the war and the<br>convergence of its neutrality and the<br>fact that the topic was so little<br>studied struck me as important so my PhD<br>which was entitled between the devil and<br>the deep blue sea the Netherlands<br>neutrality in the military in the Great<br>War was subsequently published as book<br>called the art of staying neutral my<br>Amsterdam University Press in 2006 it<br>made as one reviewer put it a major<br>contribution to the history of the great<br>war because it showed how active the<br>Dutch state and its armed forces had to<br>be to police monitor and manage their<br>neutrality<br>neutrality politics involve not only<br>maintaining good economic and diplomatic<br>relations with the belligerents but also<br>monitoring and mobilizing the Dutch<br>population<br>to persuade them that upholding the<br>neutrality and the territorial integrity<br>of their state were key ideas and were<br>really quite important now one of my key<br>arguments was that by 1918 by the end of<br>the war the Netherlands was in a<br>precarious position and that it suffered<br>many of the same consequences and social<br>inequity in pacts of war as the<br>belligerence did in other words what I'm<br>trying to say it's not only that the war<br>impacted a neutral state but also that<br>the question the answer to the question<br>what does neutrality mean or what does<br>it mean at what in 1918 was something<br>quite different from what it was in 1914<br>was not a constant idea so the PhD also<br>brought up another fascinating question<br>what did neutrality mean before 1914 now<br>I intended to that to be a study of<br>known neutral countries so all of them<br>small all of them weak like the<br>Netherlands like Sweden like Switzerland<br>like Belgium and my research eventually<br>appeared as a book with the title an age<br>of neutrals great power politics 1815 to<br>1914<br>it really showed that new he was not a<br>policy for the small and weak in fact it<br>was a policy for all states throughout<br>the century based on archival materials<br>in Britain in the Netherlands and in<br>Belgium as well as a host of<br>contemporary publications and legal<br>publications political publications<br>newspaper publications from around<br>Europe the book offered offers a new<br>history of the 19th century and argues<br>that neutrality underpinned the<br>diplomacy of the era the economics of<br>ended uh sterilizing empires had formed<br>the basis of the strength of the British<br>Empire and its existence helps to<br>explain why the 19th century was as<br>han-shan Morgenthau put it a golden age<br>of international law now it's a big book<br>covering a century of complex diplomatic<br>international economic imperial legal<br>and cultural developments rated ranging<br>from the neutralization of the small<br>territory of mores net wit which has 300<br>people in a zinc mine to the legal<br>president set during the American Civil<br>War from the conduct of the Crimean War<br>to the origins of the First World War to<br>the idealization of neutrality as a<br>national and international estoy deal<br>this research in turn helped me to<br>inspired me to secure another milestone<br>grad but most of all to focus on a new<br>research project which I'm working on<br>right now which is another big book a<br>global history of the two Hague peace<br>conferences of 1899 and 1907<br>but I really we should say is that it<br>would seem that neutrality is not so<br>irrelevant after all thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
