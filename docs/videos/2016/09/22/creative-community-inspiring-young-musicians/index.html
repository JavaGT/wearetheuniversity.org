There's seven <br>brothers. They have no sisters.<br>So all the seven brothers,  <br>they got instruments and stuff and put <br>us together. We formed this brass band.<br>I am the voice teacher for the Academy. <br>We give out free lessons to kids.<br>You know, some people don't have the <br>chance to learn, have lessons and stuff.<br>We like to help out other people, you know,  <br>keep them occupied, keep them busy <br>by making use of their talent.<br>I'm the piano teacher at the Academy.<br>I started playing the piano when I was six.<br>Now, I'm passing it on to my students.<br>The fun thing about it is teaching the little <br>kids, teaching them things that they've  <br>never seen before, you know. Reading music is <br>definitely something different from reading words.<br>Just to see them want to come to their lesson, <br>have fun, see the smile on their face, you know,  <br>and the encouragement from their <br>parents, the support that they get.<br>The parents are really supportive, <br>bringing them to their lessons on time.<br>I am the string teacher for the Academy. <br>The violins keep running out because  <br>parents are really excited at the idea <br>of having a child who's a string player.<br>I teach drums. I have a lot of <br>students from the ages six to about 17.<br>I'm looking forward to coming to university <br>next year to study classical music.<br>I teach theory lesson. It's basic <br>teaching how to read the notes.<br>In the future, I would like to be <br>a conductor â€”orchestra conductor,  <br>and also compose my own music.<br>With the contents that we have, the kids <br>definitely improve because they're so into it.<br>When you look, you can see it in their <br>face that they're really enjoying it.<br>Some of the kids that I <br>teach, they struggle in school  <br>so I think music is a way for them to <br>make a path for them in the future.<br>I wanted to become involved with this because <br>there are many Islanders out there who want  <br>to learn a string instrument. To learn a <br>string instrument, it's really expensive.<br>I really understood that struggle.<br>There's always this wow moment in <br>every lesson and it's just like,<br>when they say, "oh, I didn't know that. Now I <br>know that," I'm just like that's why I do it.<br>I really enjoy that feeling.<br>I'm really there to teach them how <br>to sing, how to use their voices.<br>It's up to them whether if they <br>want to pursue a career or not.<br>When you know that they've learned something,  <br>it kind of becomes the best feeling. <br>If they're happy then you're happy.<br>So I kind of like teaching <br>it because they're good,  <br>and I feel like what they learn <br>will be good for them in the future.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
