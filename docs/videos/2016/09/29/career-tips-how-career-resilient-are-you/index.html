In this session, we will look at practical advice about how to be positive, flexible and resilient in a quickly changing environment.<br><br>The world of work is rapidly evolving. Throughout our lives we will encounter unforeseen career opportunities, challenges and disappointments. Career resilience is an important skill that allows us to cope, and even thrive, when life throws us a curveball.<br><br>How career resilient are you?  Are you able to adapt to adversity in your career development and make use of your life experiences and relationships to help guide your decisions? Are you open to opportunities (and sometimes create them)?</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi everyone we might get started I think<br>we're two minutes over<br>but you're all very resilient so I'm<br>sure you fine with that hey we are to<br>cope with it my name is Peter so I'm a<br>career development manager here in the<br>business school and this is my colleague<br>Tamsin hi I'm career development advisor<br>in the business school hmm that's the<br>introductions<br>sorry this evening can talk about how to<br>be positive flexible and resilient in<br>this very quickly changing environment<br>things are just changing seems to be<br>quicker and quicker doesn't it September<br>and people are already talking about<br>Christmas have you've made your<br>Christmas plans yes that's a time where<br>we really need to be resilient isn't it<br>so we're going to actually address what<br>resilience really is and then how to<br>respond to events particularly adverse<br>ones and then the impact of our thoughts<br>our thoughts have a lot to do with<br>resilience and we'll give you quite a<br>few helpful resources as well you don't<br>have to worry about taking lots of notes<br>because we will make our PowerPoint<br>available to you so you'll get an email<br>ok so just a pretty dog picture really<br>so stuff does happen so this poor little<br>dog my world is spinning<br>so resilience helps us cope when our<br>world is falling spinning and in terms<br>of why it just seems to be a very<br>topical thing these days doesn't it<br>we're seeing quite a lot about<br>resilience in the media there are<br>workshops about resilience I think it's<br>the pace of change the economy has a lot<br>to do with it<br>when we were doing workshop for this<br>research for this workshop<br>and Christchurch came along a polite<br>didn't it certainly did here yeah heaps<br>year yeah and other sort of significant<br>world events like things like fear of<br>terrorism and those sorts of things<br>which may not have been so dominant in<br>the past yeah yeah um the global<br>financial crisis seems to have had an<br>even now they're talking a lot about<br>that just economy and Jim general and<br>technology the pace of change the<br>internet digitization all of that is<br>having a big impact and making us sort<br>of have to be more resilient to cope<br>with it there are greater expectations<br>in the workplace there seems to be this<br>thing where we have to do more with less<br>and short-term contracts part-time work<br>are becoming more and more common and so<br>the idea of sort of a job monday to<br>friday 925 is slowly diminishing and<br>then stress and burnout is increasing<br>because of all of us so resilience is<br>very important and just seems to be<br>becoming more so here and that burnout<br>one of the fits of<br>having all that technology is that now<br>do you do you ever feel as though you<br>get away from work are you always<br>contactable most of us are we've got our<br>phones we've got computers and people<br>are expecting us to them to work later<br>in the evening on weekends and things<br>like that they're expecting us to be<br>present in the workplace even when we're<br>not present in the workplace another<br>issue with them with Millennials is that<br>whole fear of missing out so people<br>putting stress on themselves because<br>they want to do anything and there's<br>been a lot written recently about how<br>Millennials are burning out earlier than<br>the previous generations because they<br>just they want to get everything done<br>they want it they want to be doing the<br>gym at five o'clock in the morning and<br>they want to be socializing at eleven<br>o'clock at night and in the end your<br>your resilience can um can weaken and<br>so I mean one of the things that I can<br>affect our resilience as some sort of<br>myths that we lived with<br>and one of those things as happiness as<br>a natural state that we should all be<br>happy all of the time well actually no<br>evolutions lift lift us with a fairly<br>strong fight or flight tourism response<br>so happiness is something that we have<br>sometimes but it's certainly not<br>something a state that we are naturally<br>programmed to be in all the time<br>there's also the sort of myth that if<br>you're frustrated then you're actually<br>defectives that that you um you<br>shouldn't be frustrated well again<br>that's um it's being frustrated as as<br>normal as being happy so there's nothing<br>wrong with that<br>this is there's a sense that<br>in order to be happy and a little bit to<br>be create a better life then we have to<br>get rid of all those negative feelings<br>that we have to exclude them from our<br>lives but actually I'm doing that can<br>actually do you more harm than good so<br>not not such a wise idea and and there's<br>probably one of the greatest myths of<br>all the myth that you can control what<br>you think and some we may think that we<br>can but but it's actually what we our<br>control over what we think is actually<br>so what's resilience it's the ability to<br>to bounce back from adversity I think<br>you said Peter it's at some like a a<br>tree rather than on rather than breaking<br>you've been down and then you come back<br>again so it's a sort of a visualization<br>that you can um that you can hear it's<br>the ability to work through through<br>challenges to not be overwhelmed by them<br>and it's the ability to overcome<br>obstacles not to be stopped by them and<br>as i see did fall down seven times<br>bounce back and get up there date<br>so I've got some examples here so<br>Starbucks<br>so how would shorts he gave if he had<br>given up after being tuned down by banks<br>242 times there might not be starbucks<br>some people you know may think that<br>might not be a bad thing<br>just depends JK rowling if she'd stopped<br>me after being turned down by multiple<br>publishers we wouldn't have Harry Potter<br>there's another harry potter coming out<br>well not harry potter but another movie<br>season that world in november if you're<br>fans i think it's mid november it's it<br>80 80 years before the harry potter<br>world in new york which will be<br>different<br>well Disney can you imagine a world<br>without his Newland<br>300 in two times he had to try and get<br>as<br>concept<br>through and get the money in the funding<br>for it<br>ok so just going to show you where I'm<br>DVD so Steve Jobs is very sort of<br>he's a well-known person with a lot of<br>resilience<br>okay so what have you been listening to<br>that you probably sort of determined<br>some factors that made and resilient so<br>I'm so it's each of your tables just<br>take a couple of minutes to discuss the<br>factors that you identified in that<br>video that made Steve particularly<br>resilient during those what we are quite<br>challenging and difficult times so at<br>each of your tables<br>in<br>okay it would be great now if you'd<br>actually share with the room so could<br>each table just shout out one what you<br>thought was a how he showed resilience<br>during those times hard times so stop<br>October at the front there<br>one particular<br>was it reddit it yep absolutely<br>he talked quite a bit about trust didn't<br>he yes yeah is what I thought that it<br>would all work out<br>and that and that faith that yes things<br>would be things might be hard now but<br>they would be better in the future<br>and how about this table at the front<br>here<br>mother's situation<br>yep<br>mmhmm<br>yeah<br>actually putting himself and that really<br>difficult situation yeah mmm<br>indeed and having the intestinal<br>fortitude to know that if he walked that<br>was at seven miles just to get a really<br>good meal and one day a week so so yeah<br>but so you really putting it out there<br>yeah i mean that's Sean through didn't<br>it and that Sean threw in his message<br>there at the end about don't settle<br>but also the fact that he he sort of<br>learnt from loot so much from his<br>mistakes I think that also came through<br>a lot de not anything you noticed it he<br>talked about curiosity and intuition and<br>he talked about having the confidence to<br>follow your heart<br>so those things still for me hmm<br>absolutely so so<br>he was able to regulate his emotions he<br>didn't sort of let the fear of failure<br>or embarrassment and things like that<br>stop him from actually trying and even<br>if he failed he just picked himself up<br>after a while quite quickly actually and<br>started again and tried something else<br>and he did that multiple times hmm he<br>seemed to sort of embrace challenge he<br>didn't sort of see it as a barrier he<br>actually accepted it and embraced it saw<br>it as an opportunity I think<br>then of course you've got persistence in<br>the face of setbacks he's also I think<br>some failures sort of like basically<br>helpful feedback and these are all<br>things that help when it comes to<br>resilience<br>positive thinking he did sometimes you<br>know things did get him down but then he<br>would sort of reframe it and think<br>positively about the situation<br>because how many of us could actually<br>feel that being set but from one of the<br>most major companies in the world was<br>actually in the end a really good thing<br>hindsight helps though true hindsight is<br>a find a thing yes yeah so these are the<br>factors that do help with resilience<br>positive thinking<br>sort of been able to regulate your<br>emotions those are probably the key but<br>the other ones as well I think the other<br>ones really do fall out of those fears<br>mm<br>so what about you so we just like you to<br>sort of like take a moment talk about it<br>on your tables if you want think about<br>what do you observe about yourself when<br>you are resilient and then what do you<br>observe about yourself when you're not<br>and the impact sort of you know mentally<br>physically socially emotionally when<br>you're not being resilient just take a<br>couple of minutes to think about there<br>okay I think we wrap up your just brute<br>discussions now this one's a lot more<br>personal so I'm not going to pick on<br>tables but if anyone's happy about<br>cheering cheering any of these<br>answers to these questions<br>with the group<br>I'd encourage you to but it's very much<br>voluntary because this is a lot more<br>person or this than I'm they're talking<br>about Steve Jobs<br>so does anyone anyone happy to share<br>perhaps what what they observe about<br>their self when they are particularly<br>resilient<br>first open we're passionate about Rosie<br>or about somehow achieving that goal<br>so that passion enables your resilience<br>yeah<br>experience<br>mm-hmm okay so sorry versity being<br>actually an advantage because you've<br>been able to better cope with them<br>adversity in the future and it's<br>stretching and growing your boundaries<br>as well what you're able to do you to<br>stretch each time a little bit more<br>hmm so that comfort zone expends each<br>how about that that's that second time<br>what what what do you observe about<br>yourself when when you're not so<br>resilient<br>well for me sometimes that's we're not<br>tired I tend not to bounce back so<br>quickly if I'm physically exhausted or<br>mentally exhausted<br>not you probably the same itchy i think<br>tiredness has quite a big impact on it<br>it can affect mode definitely so if<br>you're not feeling resilient i think<br>it's out of balance<br>that's how I tend to describe it these<br>days I'm not quite balanced<br>so I might be feeling anxious or unhappy<br>or whatever it is but I just got out of<br>a lot of this is about emotional self<br>awareness and understanding our emotions<br>and how things have an influence on<br>emotions also sort of think seeing<br>things about like Steve Jobs sort of<br>seeing things don't sort of dwell on the<br>failures just it's an opportunity to<br>learn and instead focusing on success if<br>we go back to sort of what we were<br>talking about before from an evolution<br>perspective we're actually programmed to<br>notice our failures because it's through<br>noticing the failure that our ancestors<br>actually survived those who didn't<br>notice failures and didn't notice that<br>there was a line on the wash the other<br>ones that died so our ancestors were the<br>ones that dwelled on the failure and the<br>negative and the scary things that might<br>be in the bushes so it's kind of an<br>unbuilt thing that is really hard for us<br>to cope with<br>understanding choice that we do have<br>choices being aware of other people<br>around us<br>being able to deal with conflict is can<br>be really hard and understanding that<br>there is a really big link between sort<br>of what we think our thoughts our<br>emotions and our body<br>so what we think can have a big impact<br>on even to something like your heart<br>rate our autonomous autonomic nervous<br>system there's a big impact on that<br>so all of those things just emotions<br>have such a big part to pay income<br>controlling them or maybe managing them<br>as a better word hmm absolutely<br>there was someone mentioned that that<br>when they were not feeling so resilient<br>often though the motivation to exercise<br>the motivation to get out and do stuff<br>that you usually do and I think that's<br>also part of that that whole physical<br>connection that you you lose those<br>there's those motivations and then<br>you'll your body doesn't get the<br>exercise and then that goes back to the<br>brain so it can be a bit of a vicious<br>one of the things we're combating is<br>that I've liked that whole lift right<br>brain conflict so your right brain tries<br>to say the color that your left brain is<br>insisting on reading the word so trying<br>to control our thoughts is actually<br>really difficult because that battle is<br>going on within us you had a good yeah I<br>was at a workshop recently talking about<br>a particular part of thought thought<br>control and he looked i love this<br>example and he said so if you can think<br>about a box<br>think about what colors that box<br>what shapes that box is it rectangular<br>is it a round box<br>does it have any particular exciting<br>features as it preps blue with polka<br>dots<br>does it have something poking out of the<br>box<br>now don't think about the box<br>but any dough and what and what what are<br>you thinking about now yes probably<br>you're starting to think about that box<br>because I told you not to so that's what<br>the whole thing is that it's really<br>really hard to control your thoughts<br>because your thoughts do not want to be<br>controlled and also our brain doesn't<br>process the word not so if you tell<br>yourself don't fall over you're going to<br>fall over and so if you tell yourself<br>you know things like don't not do not<br>anything like that the negatives their<br>brain doesn't really process negatives<br>so as soon as you start thinking don't<br>fall over don't trip don't trip your<br>truck<br>you're stretching the body in the brain<br>and the brain<br>okay so yeah so it's more effect of<br>managing your thoughts than controlling<br>them so they could because you can<br>manage aspects of your thoughts but it's<br>actually that level of total control<br>that some<br>that that's a lot more difficult extra<br>frankly I'm almost impossible<br>but it's also realizing that there's<br>nothing that's actually good or bad<br>except you thinking that it's good or<br>bad so it's actually thinking about the<br>effect that your thoughts are having on<br>you on your end you're on your<br>resilience so when it comes to managing<br>your thoughts<br>it often starts with self talk if you<br>think about the things you actually tell<br>yourself so you do something that is<br>wrong and then you beat yourself up<br>about it you tell yourself you're an<br>idiot you're stupid what were you<br>thinking and we actually talk to<br>ourselves in a way that we would never<br>talk to another person we're criticizing<br>ourselves blaming ourselves putting<br>ourselves down quite a lot some of us do<br>it more than others and that's sort of<br>based on whether you're a sort of like<br>more of an optimistic person or more of<br>a pessimistic person but we all do it it<br>goes back to that to the evolutionary<br>thing where we're programmed to be<br>negative but unfortunately we beat<br>ourselves out quite badly<br>it is possible to practice positive<br>self-talk and just be aware of our<br>thoughts monitor our thoughts and when<br>we catch ourselves being rude to<br>ourselves sort of just you know stopping<br>and sort of thinking about what we're<br>actually saying and being kind to<br>ourselves essentially it's hard to do<br>but it's a thing that it's really good<br>to practice and get in the habit of<br>doing<br>so when you find yourself sort of<br>thinking negatively challenge those<br>thoughts work to replace them with<br>so looking at that what what what do you<br>okay so we have we have an optimist than<br>the audience oh yeah from the laughter I<br>would say most of you<br>what's actually was quite reassuring to<br>me as I'm the pessimist on their own and<br>jensen's the optimist the Thames and<br>also read opportunity is no real which<br>made me feel so much better<br>sorry Jensen that's perfectly good<br>basically optimism is associated with<br>way better health outcomes<br>just from a health perspective trying to<br>be an optimist is actually a good idea<br>the other type of people you know life<br>gives you a lemonade you make margaritas<br>to get the lemonade yeah sorry life<br>gives you lemons they make margaritas<br>not lemonade boring<br>so it has a positive effect on your<br>mental your physical health it helps you<br>respond better when it comes to sort of<br>chronic diseases as well wait these<br>studies that show way better outcomes if<br>you're a optimist and this is also<br>something that can be learned and you<br>can actually practice it and train<br>yourself to be being more optimistic and<br>you think of a career context what how<br>incredibly different those two<br>statements are if you're actually<br>thinking opportunities now here yeah<br>so this is another way of looking at the<br>optimism and the plasm as peers ilysm so<br>I'm definitely trying to teach myself<br>that the glass is half full not half<br>empty but sometimes it can actually be<br>quite good because cheer bunnies like me<br>sometimes like to look at things so<br>positively that we don't see the preps<br>and some downsides and some<br>disadvantages so in any work team it's<br>really actually good to have a mix of<br>optimists and peace lists<br>because it might be that pessimist that<br>actually makes you realize that such<br>what sounded like a fantastic idea you<br>might have to actually look at this risk<br>and counter that risk before you<br>actually carry that idea out yes that's<br>a spectrum so if you know some people<br>away there some people are there you're<br>trying to sort of be an optimist with a<br>little dose of realism<br>indeed<br>putting positive thinking into practice<br>so you can actually reframe what you<br>think so if you sort of i'm not going to<br>do that I've never done it before and<br>did reframe it to think that it's an<br>opportunity to learn something new<br>you know you might think that it's too<br>complicated so just you know sort of<br>once again it's thinking outside the<br>square or tackle it from a different<br>angle so it's just reframing your<br>thoughts and making them more positive<br>and this is really important in careers<br>because how often do we actually not<br>take advantage of an opportunity because<br>we have actually self-taught our way in<br>a negative way into thinking that we<br>can't do it so we just reham we won't<br>take advantage of that opportunity<br>you know if Steve Jobs had a thought<br>it's too radical a change and Heather<br>what let's take a chance yeah yeah I'm<br>not going to get any better at this you<br>know he just yeah I'll give it another<br>try<br>yeah so acceptance and commitment<br>training is a way of increasing your arm<br>your resilience so the acceptance part<br>of it is except your internal right life<br>and try not to struggle with it and be<br>present in the moment rather than<br>spending all your arm or your life<br>looking looking backwards and thinking<br>oh if only I'd done this just just<br>accept that and move on thus the sea is<br>the commitment is choosing the direction<br>and life that you value and then to<br>taking action to live the life that you<br>really want so it's a it's a it's a<br>combination of a few different things<br>practices to actually help you to become<br>more resilient<br>but by cracky<br>of course as we talked about your your<br>your your brain and your body is often<br>fighting against you so you've got the<br>whole I want to control my life versus<br>evolution where where your body is doing<br>the whole fight and flight<br>because that's what's worked in the past<br>it may not necessarily work now because<br>because the don't often as often have<br>those sorts of situations but but in a<br>in a career context we can we can take<br>flight strategies we can we can take a<br>day off because we just can't be going<br>in to face neck difficult situation orem<br>or in them in the and the fight<br>strategies<br>you might find that<br>that you're trying to force thoughts<br>away force feelings away but accepting<br>them and actually just moving on as a<br>better way of coping with that if you<br>think of it like a pressure cooker if<br>you keep trying to sort of suppress the<br>thoughts the feelings the emotions<br>at some point there is going to be an<br>explosion mm-hmm and yeah and as you<br>were talking about the another fight<br>strategies is that whole self bullying<br>that whole beating yourself up so every<br>time you find yourself doing that think<br>actually<br>would I would I would I give this advice<br>to a friend if you wouldn't impress<br>perhaps you shouldn't give that advice<br>to yourself<br>and taking a charge<br>another sort of the fight-or-flight<br>thing using some affirmations to replace<br>those negative thoughts can can be a way<br>of overcoming that sort of that fight<br>response<br>and also challenging the thoughts as<br>well and challenging the thoughts indeed<br>Deacon yeah I'm just reading arguing<br>countering or challenging thoughts I can<br>just imagine you having a fight with<br>yourself<br>sorry imagination anything so I'm so<br>another aspect of acceptance and<br>commitment training is actually two to<br>sit down and think okay what is the<br>actual issue because sometimes when we<br>when we actually step back a bit and and<br>clarify that issue or that problem in<br>our mind we actually realize that what<br>we thought was the issue might not be<br>the major part of the issue at all it<br>may be something else entirely so so<br>making sure that that that what you're<br>struggling with is there is the actual<br>the core issue and then thinking about<br>it okay are my feelings unproductive and<br>unhelpful<br>yeah is there anything that I can do<br>about this situation<br>if I can't do anything about that<br>situation then actually just accepting<br>that's that that you might actually just<br>have to find a quiet space just to do<br>that step back and make room for those<br>bad feelings don't shut them away just<br>just accept them and then set them aside<br>because if the if there's actually<br>nothing you can do about the situation<br>then there's no point in going over and<br>over and over on the situation again so<br>accepting those feelings and then<br>placing them aside this is from the<br>executive coaching centre sorry reading<br>sideways they do workshops<br>here in Auckland on the sort of staff<br>and one of the examples you gave is a<br>place where you could find a quiet spot<br>we're sort of driving and from work<br>you're alone presumably in your car so<br>that would give you a chance to actually<br>sort of be able to sort of think about<br>what happened and make room for the bad<br>feelings and there's no one around that<br>you could possibly scare<br>and it that can be taking yourself away<br>from other people can also stop the UM<br>the EnOcean emotional backlash that<br>could happen if someone disturbs you<br>while you're still doing that processing<br>of those those difficult feelings<br>however if they affirm that and that<br>consideration of the problem you<br>actually realize that your feelings are<br>productive and helpful and that you<br>actually can change the situation then<br>then working taking that committed<br>action based on your values to address<br>that situation<br>then then that's that that's something<br>that you can do so there's there's a<br>couple of different options<br>in how to cope with those difficult<br>situations I think the key is just<br>stepping back and analyzing it and don't<br>letting the emotions get in the way<br>beyond so taping it taking a deep breath<br>and you just to think about that so this<br>is choosing one's attitude here yeah so<br>this is something we do have a choice<br>over said like Viktor Frankl so in the<br>Holocaust he um chose a very positive<br>attitude which must mean been hard and<br>hotter cost you a lot of the time he was<br>thinking about his wife<br>and it was getting back to his wife that<br>was holding them together so having<br>someone or something like that that<br>okay so some positive strategies for<br>developing your resilience nutrition and<br>sleep it may it may sound obvious but<br>but making sure that you're well-fed and<br>that you're well-rested are actually<br>incredibly important in resilience is a<br>lot of studies that show that if you're<br>neither of those then your resilience<br>really does dip<br>to actually practice activities that<br>increase your energy so so sorry<br>actually identifying those those<br>activities and practicing those more and<br>conversely<br>activities that really that deplete your<br>energy that you're kind of dreading and<br>it's that's really taking you down see<br>if you can minimize those activities um<br>we've talked about practicing that that<br>positive self-talk and and talking to<br>yourself like you're a friend not an<br>enemy<br>focusing on the issues that are within<br>your control<br>and I think<br>that I've I've read a little bit over<br>the last few days about the Christchurch<br>earthquakes and and how the people who<br>actually struggled most with the<br>resilience during the earthquakes were<br>the ones that required within themselves<br>a high level of control because they<br>they actually didn't have them they<br>didn't have control over what was going<br>whereas those that actually were able to<br>both mostly be resilient were those who<br>were able to accept that they didn't<br>have to have control over all events in<br>their lives and so that's this has been<br>a lot of work done on studied studies on<br>the arm of the Christchurch earthquakes<br>a lot of interesting reading out there I<br>was um having coffee with a friend over<br>the weekend on Sunday and she's talking<br>about how she went into the office she<br>started off talking about a lot of<br>things that were happening at work and<br>it was mainly run people issues and<br>personnel and a lot of change of staff<br>and Bessie she didn't have much control<br>at all<br>so then she was talking about how on<br>Saturday she went in to the office and<br>she cleaned up her office so she threw<br>out a whole lot of paper she spent seven<br>hours tidying up her office so we were<br>as we do analyzing that and it was<br>because she had control over that she<br>could decide whether to throw that piece<br>of paper out or not and that was about<br>the only thing that isn't who control at<br>the moment at work so seven hours just<br>basically recycling the whole of a paper<br>but it made her feel better because it<br>did give her that sense of control hmm<br>and connecting with others were also<br>really important and begin to use the<br>Christchurch earthquake example a lot of<br>fun activities that happened during that<br>their Christchurch earthquake was<br>because people wanted to help other<br>people you know krept was going on all<br>around them but connecting with other<br>people made everyone feel much better<br>and so they became much more resilient<br>as a result of the UM the feedback<br>positive feedback that others gave them<br>one that's I like is the fine three good<br>things and I do notice that if I don't<br>do that on a regular basis I do start to<br>get out of balance and that's one of the<br>ways I get myself back in balance and<br>you can do it at any time but I tend to<br>do it at night just after I've gone to<br>be it and I just think about the day and<br>I don't limit myself to three but it it<br>can be just minor little things so like<br>one day I was waiting for the bus and I<br>saw a bird who seemed to be sort of just<br>digging and digging and digging and<br>digging in the garden and it was just<br>yeah just lovely watching it or it might<br>be a rainbow or the other day I had five<br>to ease and Michael I tree I'm just<br>little things like that can make all the<br>difference and part of that is being<br>present<br>so not they told mindfulness it may<br>sound like a buzzword now but it's a<br>it's actually been present in the moment<br>and noticing what's going on around you<br>rather than letting yourself be taken<br>over by your thoughts and your feelings<br>actually bringing yourself out of that<br>and starting to notice the world because<br>we tend to focus on the past and the<br>future but we don't tend to folk on the<br>present<br>and it's on all those racy coloring in<br>box who would have thought a couple of<br>years ago that that the biggest seller<br>last Christmas would have been adult<br>coloring in books so go figure but a lot<br>of people get a lot of benefit out of<br>them because they have to concentrate on<br>coloring and they have to really focus<br>on that and that allows them to exclude<br>other stuff that's actually intervening<br>in there I'm in their mind and just have<br>some some mental peace that's why some<br>people like gardening for example it<br>does the same thing for some people and<br>my sister I could never understand it<br>she liked hanging out the washing but it<br>was the mothers weird it was it was the<br>only time at home where she could be on<br>her own she was sure that the children<br>wouldn't turn up at the clothesline<br>because they'd get a job but also to it<br>was just the whole meditative rhythmic<br>thing of doing that and being outside as<br>well mmm another great thing as far as<br>some improving your resilience oddly<br>enough as being nice to other people so<br>being kind to others can actually help<br>boost their resilience but also your<br>resilience and visualizations someone<br>told me years ago so I practice this<br>every morning I<br>visualized that it's going to be a<br>really good day and then I give myself a<br>big beam and them and the mirror every<br>morning and so the first thing really<br>that I do every day is a really nice<br>positive thing so those sorts of the<br>visualizations they can be all sorts of<br>different visualizations but but that<br>can assist you as well then just bring<br>out a cope with life frankly can be a<br>goal seen yourself actually achieving<br>the goal some people do vision boards so<br>they actually do cut stuff out and have<br>a overboard that they look at every day<br>one thing to remember though is get help<br>if you're struggling or even if it's<br>just a share with friends or family or<br>colleagues what's going on that can be<br>very helpful as well and your effort if<br>things are really overwhelming you seek<br>professional help<br>that's what the professionals are<br>therefore to assist you through times<br>where you adjust our account really cope<br>and so we have talked a bit about<br>optimism and things like that if you<br>actually want to take it online to<br>figure out with you're an optimist or a<br>pessimist I usually do that test I<br>thought always been a realist I don't<br>know<br>but they have lots of different tiers<br>University of Pennsylvania so authentic<br>happiness so they have lots of different<br>tiers you can figure out what your<br>strengths are they've got one about 24<br>core strengths a general happiness scale<br>they've got the grip test and so if you<br>enjoy that sort of thing you could<br>always go and have a look you've got to<br>register but don't worry about that<br>they're very happy if you don't have to<br>go to the University of Pennsylvania<br>nativities they're happy for everyone to<br>do it because it's just more<br>information for them for their research<br>there's another website that I<br>particularly like which is called action<br>for happiness and this is just an<br>example of some of the actions at work<br>so they talk about sort of focused find<br>your strengths focus on using them at<br>work really listen to what people are<br>saying and we do have a tendency to not<br>listen so much get happiness on the<br>agenda at your workplace so this is<br>particularly if you're a manager that's<br>that's an idea look for the good and<br>lows around you create a heavier<br>environment at work so when you click on<br>one of these actions what it does is it<br>takes you through gives you a little bit<br>of an introduction and then takes you<br>recommended box different sorts of<br>surveys and various other places there's<br>an app there were a number of apps that<br>I saw so lots of different resources<br>that you can use to help with this sort<br>of thing<br>so the URL is the earnest I see we are<br>going to send you the powerpoint so<br>sorry besides work they also head damn<br>checks for family and friends how you<br>can sort of in your local community as<br>well I'm not quite sure how many they<br>so one of the resources is the calm<br>website with it which was actually being<br>developed here at the University of<br>Auckland it was developed for the mid<br>school students but it's evolved beyond<br>that now so anyone who wants can have a<br>look at that website they have a lot of<br>resources on there they have<br>quite a lot of like meditations that you<br>can download I can't meditate I'm really<br>yeah I just can't do it I'm totally<br>thinking about other things but I<br>stopped feeling so bad about that<br>because the author of Eat Pray Love who<br>spend all that time in India trying to<br>learn how to meditate she can't meditate<br>over so that made me feel a lot better<br>about that however that website does<br>have a walking meditation which I can<br>kind of do so these you know different<br>strokes for different folks I think it's<br>called as I already talked about<br>Pennsylvania University Mental Health<br>Foundation has resources as well it's<br>got some fantastic website with heaps of<br>stuff<br>inspirational stories are<br>recommendations for books and these<br>sorts of things and one of the books<br>that I've got here tonight some came<br>from their website so so so really<br>really rich resources<br>and a lot about Brazilians<br>action for happiness resilient scale<br>there's something called the happiness<br>Institute and then positive psychology<br>is very popular now so that's been<br>around since the late 80's I think it<br>was<br>these are just three of a whole lot of<br>different books that are out there so as<br>terms and said there's this one even<br>under pressure which you're welcome to<br>come and have a look at feel the fear<br>and do it anyway so I first read that i<br>think it was probably the 80s so it was<br>kind of before computers so i read it<br>re-read it just recently it's quite<br>funny from that perspective but it has a<br>lot of really good stuff in it and<br>then the 7 Habits of Highly Effective<br>People that's also a last century book<br>but it's a classic and just updated a<br>little bit the happiness project by<br>Gretchen Rubin she has two children she<br>lives in New York she's a writer as she<br>feels guilty about wanting to be a bit<br>being more happy and so she sort of<br>talks about that in her book but what<br>she did is each month she took just one<br>thing that she wanted to address so it<br>might have been cutter so one month she<br>just worked on her pleasure another<br>month she pretty much said yes to<br>everything and so it was things like<br>that so each month it was just a<br>different thing which i think is a nice<br>manageable way to do it she has another<br>here's my and one of the reasons that<br>we've given you all these resources is<br>that resilience often is not something<br>that you just are going to achieve<br>sometimes you actually really need do<br>need to work at it and that's why we've<br>given you all those resources to assist<br>you if you're struggling to fit you're<br>not feeling resilient to give you some<br>techniques to assist you in their<br>process I think for all of us it's<br>something different like I see it you<br>know some people can't meditate some<br>people can so there are sort of like<br>different techniques that suit all of us<br>okay so we'll just leave you with this<br>final thought<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
