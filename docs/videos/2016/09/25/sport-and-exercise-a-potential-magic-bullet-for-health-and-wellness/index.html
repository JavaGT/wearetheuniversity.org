get into<br>the top topic of the talk<br>my family it's really great to see a<br>Catholic in Helen in the frontier a<br>big component of my life obviously and<br>with a product of an academic career my<br>son Luke was born in Cape Town 11 years<br>ago<br>my daughter Helen was a Geordie for nanu<br>castle upon tyne and the United Kingdom<br>for eight years we walked to worked in<br>the northeast of England<br>the last two and a half years in the<br>farming heartlands of bloom can type<br>we've simply chosen some beautiful<br>places and perhaps beating them all is<br>the beauty of the wakita region of New<br>Zealand it really is beautiful we really<br>excited to be living here<br>just you will know that a great affinity<br>for New Zealand this is actually I've<br>got I've coming on my third attempt in<br>1992 is the first country after I've<br>finished my medicine i applied to as an<br>orthopedic registro applied for a<br>hospital in christchurch to be a whole<br>thing's orthopaedic registro they turned<br>me down which is perhaps for cheers from<br>the fact that are really enjoyed a<br>career in science and academics<br>applied for in our two thousand and six<br>thousand 93 90 93 in 2060 editor<br>partners porn exercises in oakland<br>university they offered me the job so it<br>was 10<br>and i turned that went down for my UK<br>job and then i'm very fortunate to be<br>offered this job now so on the third<br>time i'm finally in one of the most<br>beautiful countries in the world<br>I've actually got a strong sporting<br>background that's me a number of pounds<br>latter and with more hair I was a<br>reasonably good peddler and kayaker I<br>still trying cycle we went cycling on<br>Sunday on the Quran you gorge it's<br>really really beautiful and I already<br>love to use my support as I can around<br>my family and work commitments<br>now my issue is I need to catch and<br>watch my diet and this I love built on<br>the story she and I wanted near three<br>built on shops which is good and bad<br>better that's we all got work on the<br>health and wellness and that's my<br>challenge to avoid those shops<br>in my career I've chosen teen worked in<br>a diverse array of Kenya yami sorry<br>you're not diesel okay in anniversary of<br>different technical university research<br>environments and leadership roles of<br>increasing complexity over the last 25<br>years I did my medical training in<br>Tunisia of cape town at the critter<br>skier hospital complex it's well known<br>actually for the first heart transplant<br>there in the 1960s with chris barnard<br>we are great the medical class practice<br>of statins forces ever again event for<br>the rest of the world a we all over the<br>world I've acted knowledge my colleague<br>Chris Dewey it was awkward with on<br>Sunday he's a highly rated respect to GP<br>in Martinsville and it's so nice to have<br>a colleague sitting there an audience<br>that Chris it's wonderful we working<br>close to you it must be said they was<br>available training in MA Chris Marta<br>disagree but we didn't have a lot of<br>trading in population health or wellness<br>and we were very high level technology<br>curative surgery and medicine that<br>Barbie in the partner legacy but we<br>didn't do much primary health care or<br>wellness it was all about curative<br>interventional medicine I<br>certainly worked as an intern and it is<br>a surgical medical officer in rural<br>hospitals and Italian South Africa in<br>darlin graves in hospitals to be honest<br>again there was no wellness in that part<br>of my career it was a high level of<br>trauma management as much in most of my<br>couple of years there it is the heart of<br>the the end of the apartheid regime that<br>is almost a civil war there was just<br>violence the whole time when we were<br>doing a last nasty traumatic reparative<br>operational work on gunshot gunshot and<br>stab wounds was interesting in a very<br>sad time<br>it working those hospital environments<br>caused me I'm moist be one of those<br>people that ask the question why and how<br>so in the hospitals are asking why are<br>we doing this what does this do and I<br>think I realize quite soon that research<br>rather than the clinical medicine was<br>going to be for me actually one of the<br>main things I've got to be interested is<br>off to a fractured femur because we had<br>not enough money in the rural hospitals<br>instead having an internal fixation we<br>used to put the news very older types of<br>links and most of the time I didn't make<br>them better the patients they got worse<br>and worse they lost muscle mass at<br>eventually died and some of them got<br>really debilitated over the months there<br>something only I realized that mostly<br>perhaps at HIV we didn't taste as much<br>of them as we should it's a big problem<br>in Northern Attell and it's l it's also<br>a disused atrophy and that got me going<br>into into research I knew someone called<br>Tim Noakes and kept up and he encouraged<br>me to do my PhD and looking at the<br>causes of neural atrophy and neural and<br>muscular atrophy sonar PS he looked at<br>after a cruciate ligament operation what<br>happens to the quadriceps and a trophy<br>or muscle you get a lot of vector field<br>innovation damage<br>my medical doctor I moved into more<br>brain top research and that was on<br>chronic fatigue and athletes and<br>athletes they push themselves to the<br>utterly break down again their muscles<br>get damaged in and then the<br>neuromuscular system breaks down the<br>hypothermic pituitary access breaks down<br>these these guys rent too much indexer<br>to my sister huge drive to win<br>netherlands pathological and leather my<br>work was looking at an elite athletes<br>what's happening in the child that's<br>creating them there's a need to push<br>themselves so hard and networks been<br>going on the last 10 or 15 years there<br>was my medical doctor it<br>this period I did most of my son's<br>outputs I was a chair of integrative<br>neuroscience again a few kilograms<br>lighter and more hair I did a whole lot<br>of integrative neuroscience looking at<br>EMG EG spec Tillich stimulations animal<br>work human work the nice thing about if<br>you want to see what I published there's<br>my papers are out on PubMed you can have<br>a look at them we've developed a theory<br>that's caused a bit of interest about<br>integration of multiple systems in the<br>control of exercise that's cause the<br>most of my citations are in this area<br>but it was there this is the first time<br>after all this time I learned about<br>wellness and health and I tracked her<br>knowledge when Damon and modern wellness<br>and a teacher in Swat I work part time<br>helping their practices wellness<br>prevention many with cardiac patients<br>you were recovering making them improve<br>their their health and wellness and<br>sporting activity<br>subsequently I worked at the foremost<br>biomedical research into the national<br>suit of Health I went back into basic<br>research for a while more Canada is an<br>astonishing man is one of the best<br>academic in religious he's published<br>over a thousand papers and I think 28 of<br>30 nature and science papers it was a<br>mess of its the best far biggest<br>biomedical Center in the world we did<br>something called transcranial magnetic<br>stimulation when you put in pulses into<br>the brain that was me being practiced on<br>by my colleague vintage voila<br>we did some interesting work on for<br>example stroke patients where we put an<br>anesthetic with an ether just put an<br>aesthetic that would reduce the muscle<br>activity in the shoulder for example and<br>we are trying to improve the function in<br>the hand scavenging brain function from<br>the any thought a step compiling salamo<br>assassin any work wasn't completely<br>successful but was a good effort I<br>then from our sins perhaps in 2006 went<br>into management we are still there now<br>at issues director research and then as<br>a header Department of Sport exercise<br>and rehabilitation at North Emory<br>University in the UK<br>in these roles we worked hard to<br>increase the energy I'm what's called an<br>ENTJ which means I'm an extrovert I give<br>a lot energy to my work we turn around<br>what there's a little bit of an<br>underperforming in a place that didn't<br>have a lot of good equipment and turn it<br>into a<br>research rich and quite a dynamic<br>department there was probably when a mom<br>are successful ideas of my career to<br>diets read stuff i worked with there<br>for the management we built a working CD<br>management we built a 34 million pound<br>new sport health and wellness built that<br>will be pushing for something similar<br>here<br>yeah<br>with a whole suite of labs at sporting<br>facilities inside<br>it's a good circle one see what<br>something not yet so we encourage some<br>of the topper young academics in the UK<br>to come and work with us some of the top<br>/ sports work because of the fact that<br>we were moving in going places in<br>Northumbria we built up a very big PhD<br>at postgraduate group of great young<br>folk guitar now world leaders in the<br>exercise science field around the world<br>and we work very closely with the NHS<br>hospitals up in the Newcastle about Tom<br>and gets it a doctor knowledge d kada<br>getting money from companies and things<br>I've got to sponsor the researcher we<br>did<br>the last job before this i did a top<br>five medical school as we as robin said<br>with 28 a big a big year one of the big<br>pinnacle schools back in South Africa we<br>basically looked after all the different<br>components of the business the academic<br>business what most senior university<br>managers would lead I think the<br>important things I learnt is like a<br>weave rawson and the team have talked<br>about it once you get into these fields<br>you whether we're pretty close with your<br>department of alpha your dhb and get<br>your contracts right and a lot of our<br>time we're spending on memorandums of<br>agreement we had a great senior<br>management team that we all work<br>together to get this right we<br>restructure the the management of the<br>whole medical school<br>we are quite part of this one Annette<br>South African bikinis everywhere and<br>apply she worked it is very conservative<br>and 20 years after the end of apartheid<br>the medical school in tech was still<br>eighty percent white South Africans<br>which was completely unacceptable and we<br>very quickly changed that when I came in<br>to you can see it swung around to 50 50<br>and up to eighty percent ethnic blackest<br>of arrogance and that's probably one of<br>those I'll be most part of a matamata at<br>the end of my career it caused a lot of<br>issues political and psychosocial issues<br>the medical school because of these<br>changes within the press in bluffington<br>every day I think I was a bit of a<br>persona non grata for some other<br>sections of the community and in era and<br>others it's incredibly political the<br>things that you work in Russia will<br>again it made send it two ways political<br>not quite to hopefully to the extent to<br>hear that you constantly got if you want<br>to make changes you've got it gets quite<br>hot<br>we also worked on a community based<br>education into professional development<br>and the smaller towns and rural free<br>states for my sins I also was given a<br>job of developing a campus-wide sport<br>health and wellness strategy with<br>nanotech ccrt we looked at integrating<br>the health and wellness of the entire<br>campus making things like health trails<br>you can see doorjambs encouraging stuff<br>with the staff cards<br>to have a component set from Clemson<br>University we got the idea in the States<br>so there's your staff quad you knock on<br>to it and it shows that you've got a<br>record that you doing exercise work you<br>get some benefit from that<br>so help support in exercises there for<br>being the core business and interest of<br>my career for the last 31 years<br>integrating in different parts of it in<br>a great period and I'm really excited to<br>be taking it on ya at the next step in<br>developing something this is a new<br>challenge from use developing something<br>from very new and building up from that<br>experience I've had something similar to<br>one of these different components here<br>working with a lot of you in the<br>audience<br>going to the substance of the exercises<br>of magic bullets the sad thing is of its<br>noticed it run the world from a general<br>perspective health and wellness appears<br>to be worsening rather than improving<br>worldwide a casar with all this work on<br>sport exiles and wellness event been<br>doing the spot the prevalence of sport<br>in our society in research into this<br>paradoxical rapidly develop a beastly<br>and chronic illness epidemic in the<br>developed and also interesting in the<br>developing world this is called diseases<br>of lifestyle or non communicable<br>diseases as a policy seminar HIV or TB<br>which is called communicable tap<br>diseases so these are lifestyle it's<br>from eating too much it's from not doing<br>enough exercise from having too much<br>junk food around these are creating<br>problems for the community and society<br>unfortunately it's not all good news in<br>New Zealand and he's hidden sauce<br>catching up us as the leader of problems<br>of chronic disorders her health obesity<br>obesity for example USA and some parts<br>of the the error barriers there it's<br>very high but you can see from the<br>colors you see them in Australia<br>catching up as are most of the Western<br>Western world countries<br>there you can see that the VC red fur in<br>New Zealand is going up on a yearly<br>basis which is worrying<br>and also in most countries children it's<br>going up in children too and that's<br>really wearing our kids are becoming<br>progressively more obese so as the years<br>are passing by and and what you do in<br>your childhood very much a lot of<br>factors believe stay with you<br>unfortunately to your habits that you do<br>in a doubt it<br>the and it is that Kelly are linked that<br>you could have a whole election debate<br>on that but it's like a link here and<br>most people's minds between the the<br>prevalence of obesity and increased food<br>intake and not in our sport with chronic<br>disorders and diabetes for example<br>there's a massive increase in diabetes<br>in the world in the last 20 or 25 30<br>years<br>diabetes is a very much there's<br>different things reasons why the bee<br>gees occurs but taught to which is late<br>onset diabetes generally we are mean we<br>put again took a whole lecture about<br>what causes diabetes in the<br>pathophysiology but it really is just<br>too much sugar you have in a burnout<br>your incident and there's too much sugar<br>clogging up your small arteries<br>compared to what ish what you should<br>have if you don't need to mention<br>exercise these causes microcirculatory<br>damage to your arteries and you get<br>things developing my foot asses that<br>done heal you get in your are increasing<br>blindness from a blockage of the<br>arteries you get multiple new kidney<br>failure your kidneys are very really<br>prone to getting damaged from diabetes<br>and it's something that we now call the<br>metabolic syndrome where there's a whole<br>host of diseases of Las top heart<br>disease lipid problems hypertension type<br>2 diabetes<br>non-alcoholic fatty disease and this<br>some links with dementia are cancer and<br>polycystic ovarian disease and a few<br>other things that are thought to be<br>diseases of a non-communicative<br>non-communicable diseases and that are<br>perhaps linked to these lifestyle<br>the bad news also is that the top 2<br>diabetes these are the general figures<br>here and you can see unfortunately now<br>in the Pacific here there's a huge<br>amount of diabetes huge pop a large<br>population of diabetes yeah and again<br>Ross on the conditions in a more varia<br>and but there's a huge problem I know<br>him and a lot of the team are doing a<br>lot of work in the field looking at this<br>therefore what we can do and that's<br>important from our background is to<br>understand the reasons for these changes<br>but to assess an intervention programs<br>and these are often last dollar Satya<br>changes apart from the drugs and<br>injections we can start looking and we<br>need to look a lot more lifestyle<br>lifestyle exercise and nutrition<br>unfortunately there still is a very much<br>a focus on operative repair and drug<br>therapy rod in health and wellness most<br>of the money is still going into drug<br>work men operations to to fix leg houses<br>kidney transplants when perhaps that we<br>should be looking upstream at getting a<br>wellness and health fixed before we get<br>these symptoms and side effects of<br>chronic diseases of lifestyle they are<br>obviously hugely expensive one of these<br>operated in and a clinical the drugs the<br>objections are very expensive in the<br>long term and you can imagine the cost<br>is rocketing as more and more people or<br>diagnosis of disease according to soda I<br>really love roses sorry Russell to<br>mature a lot better was a very much we<br>linking in with the health and wellness<br>with your work i love you know Europe<br>there's a problem two is that and Chris<br>you'll probably see this a bit too this<br>is the GPS are becoming increasingly<br>rare in these hidden it's a problem but<br>around the world too so this is<br>paradoxically taking a lot of doctors<br>are choosing to go and do these<br>cardiothoracic surgery and these are<br>very much a hard technology tap work<br>which is very structured and focus<br>laughs but actually you need those GPS<br>in the and health practitioners in the<br>community working in certain other<br>communities I'm sure to sort out these<br>problems and my perception this is a gut<br>feeling it's not data-driven that this<br>loss of GPS is also affecting health on<br>the communities in and they get away I<br>have to mention this because it radiates<br>I'm seeing it as a more and more of a<br>problem is the increased technology my<br>father never turn on a computer nurse<br>all laugh i turn on my face computer for<br>my PhD at age 24 my kids<br>brilliant I mean a very healthy tea and<br>informal well in a better state and I<br>better my kids at eight can do move the<br>computers in our camp and this is the<br>generations are doing a lot more work<br>and laugh and living into another<br>computer screens it's quite arresting at<br>women did have gym where car two hours<br>ago and someone was doing stomach<br>crunches next to me and actually<br>treating what they're not reaching a<br>texting wherever you walk whenever you<br>walk down the street people are looking<br>at the at their phones while they walk<br>okay you can't get to a meeting without<br>people looking at the fair nine or ten<br>times so there's a bit of a joke<br>crackberry freezer there's clearly an<br>addiction happening here and it's an<br>addiction to know your your computer<br>devices and I think that that's going to<br>be a separate problem and not something<br>for this tool but it is an addiction ma<br>what I do when I'm when I'm at work<br>around you can actually count the number<br>of times people look at their phone that<br>where the fact that I reaching<br>politicans another one getting a<br>probably an anxiety disorder and 2 i've<br>got an addiction to their friends it's<br>different but it's also unfortunately is<br>leading to a lot more time spent acid<br>injury occupation instead of getting out<br>people are looking at their computers<br>all day and there is also the mental<br>side effects of heaviness constant on<br>button next to you<br>so with all these problems that is we<br>got these problems of chronic lifestyle<br>disorders and they're growing we've got<br>the intervention of personal electronic<br>devices so while scorned ex has sounds<br>the next magic bullet and I'll start<br>back to saying what a better sport makes<br>our sons<br>bouticks a sansa discipline that studies<br>the application of scientific principles<br>and techniques related to sports with<br>the aim of improving sport performance<br>and health and wellness and<br>understanding the human body's response<br>to exercise and laugh and environmental<br>stressors it's understanding how the<br>body works when you stray sit and<br>exercise is a good stress reducing your<br>food intake is a good stress<br>it's being it's been looked at a long<br>time it's not like we suddenly starting<br>sports hands now the gladiators they<br>knew that their chances of survival were<br>improved if they were fitter and I it<br>better so there was training for Gladia<br>it is to presumably not in more chance<br>of living<br>the first labs looking at sport next our<br>science and health and wellness was the<br>Harvard anatomy lab that we can pick up<br>in about eighteen ninety one at open<br>which is specifically looking at a<br>performance of individuals when they're<br>doing exercise and when they're doing a<br>stressed body stretched full activities<br>most of the early sports and research<br>was carried on an animals they put dogs<br>on treadmills and looked at what<br>happened to their blood glucose and<br>things like that<br>it was interesting he was in the 1930s<br>and 40s there was a big search before<br>world war two there was a big n in World<br>War two there was used sports science<br>was to make more fitter<br>soldiers and more healthy soldiers<br>it was on pushing was a natural<br>sociology comes in appropriated by a lot<br>of Italian states that we need to make<br>our our people<br>as Philadelphia as possible as part of<br>the doctrines<br>the 1950s and 60s boredness our sons<br>took over what we know testing breathing<br>testing energy expenditure testing a lot<br>of things that we look at to look at<br>your parameters of health and fitness<br>we now are considering increased our<br>capacity to examine humans and all these<br>different techniques hot cold pressure<br>mountains up and down it's wonderful to<br>see that sooo some of the team EF ramon<br>manga nuit we've got a wonderful<br>environmental chamber out there we were<br>some nasty philippine kit and we'll keep<br>on working out getting that with it 34<br>million pounds of building equipment in<br>the next five to 10 years<br>never we've got some great stuff that we<br>really got in the labs that we got and<br>we could also look in the field and work<br>out how much energy people are spending<br>when they're doing different activities<br>of daily living<br>split knees are sounds just it now too<br>and this is for our poster Robin you be<br>keen on this that we were to develop<br>courses to train people in different<br>areas of sport a thousand health so<br>there's for technology development<br>looking at how we can enhance<br>performance and activity there's<br>obviously spot next hour sunsets from<br>elite sport to understanding sport<br>itself sports coaching is growing is<br>there's a understanding what makes a<br>good coach and sport coaching is a big<br>thing on what makes successful teams<br>sports management sport has become a<br>multi-billion billion dollar industry so<br>there's a lot of her courses<br>particularly the UK is focused on sports<br>management and as a job out there going<br>out there and growing the profile of<br>sport across the country in the nation<br>it's put sociology we've got some top<br>sociology Sierra working it in a faculty<br>of education the moments Holly Thorpe<br>olinda at an Fe up there a class a<br>little gray trachea it's really<br>important to understand where sport fits<br>into society and what it does it's not<br>always for good as I said that some some<br>country use it for their own Gestalt way<br>of laughs and for their own political<br>gain and this is really interesting this<br>is what really hit me it is one of our<br>big WOW San hours I think my son Luke<br>sage 10 or 11 you can remember perhaps<br>some of you had it when when the<br>Springboks came and played and I think<br>the late seventies early eighties there<br>was me mess sorry anyone there was<br>massive a between New Zealand there was<br>a very sad to see there was a lot of a<br>debate and conflict about whether there<br>should be they or not it really hit me I<br>was watching at four o'clock at my daddy<br>was a hidden rugby player we washed and<br>I remember as eleven-year-old there were<br>planes with flower bombing near the<br>fields they were very sad there were<br>people running on very brief Academy<br>rife and this really got me thinking and<br>I'm really really sure that it changed<br>salary yet played its part and the New<br>Zealanders can be very proud of them at<br>the what they did which change doesn't<br>ever get to be a better place that was<br>for a lot of people it was well we can't<br>play sports against these hidden without<br>people hating it and it made changes<br>that made it celebrity a much better<br>place now<br>but social it is understanding why and<br>the dynamics behind what sport is done<br>obviously for where we going with this<br>talk and we want to develop this put<br>development to nestle pediatrician dot<br>and health top courses and work yes it's<br>good that we play sport but often the<br>people that watch sport or the least at<br>least healthy and for example that's the<br>owner of newcastle united full team and<br>as the base supporter that perhaps you<br>to go and able to support themselves and<br>obviously exercises mansion has become<br>really big sports medicine and getting<br>and that's a big concept I'd like to<br>push one on my exercises medicine it<br>really is the bigger big thing you can<br>do to change your life if you do<br>exercise in many ways and improve your<br>health and social parameters<br>so the variety of disciplines assessing<br>the sports ounce is indicative the<br>pervasiveness of sport in a growing<br>understanding that health and wellness<br>in modern society exercise and food is a<br>big place in it<br>it's become increasingly obviously<br>attrition exercise of the most relevant<br>requirements and things you can do for<br>example if you overweight with your<br>exercise you've shown to have far better<br>a future health history so it's better<br>to do sport even if you're carrying<br>weight<br>it is increasing cause to alter<br>community behavior from the individual<br>health board member one's junk food ban<br>people are getting more vocal now we<br>have to change things look at Tom the<br>last year two years have been to front<br>articles myth about exercise what this<br>was saying that exercise needs nutrition<br>and this is what exercises are cure<br>their speeds are modeling done and it's<br>estimated in the UK<br>2012 that a ten percent increase in<br>cycling walking in urban centers could<br>set the energy is 1 billion over 20<br>years so just by getting some people to<br>exercise a drop so some of these<br>diabetes and blood pressure problems<br>that that we have to somebody has to pay<br>for someone has to pay for the treatment<br>of a diabetic or a cardiac patient so if<br>you get people exercises been clearly<br>model that you actually can save money<br>as a government<br>because it's a public lecture I'm not<br>going to get too much in a sense of it<br>but Matt relish admin the better year we<br>really showed me a great article here 26<br>different chronic disorders that<br>exercise is beneficial for so instead of<br>going to show you 26 you'll have to<br>believe me that just about every chronic<br>disorder said easily shown an exercise<br>benefits from you've got to be a little<br>bit careful though if you've got a<br>cardiac patient you make them go and do<br>a five kilometer race you might kill<br>them from auto sector you better watch<br>the Nets we are training our students to<br>be people that can<br>and really look after people with health<br>challenges carefully<br>there's also mental health and community<br>wellness benefits to perform an exercise<br>and master behavioral modification<br>exercise benefits people's mental health<br>it's got social it brings community<br>together okay it really does people are<br>playing sport when they get out the idea<br>together<br>so while just to finish off now so why<br>is the University of Waikato ideally<br>suited to exclude this exploit this<br>importance of sport health and wellness<br>what can we do and what are we going to<br>benefit from all this<br>firstly obviously when I was running a<br>medical school everyone wants to do<br>medicine alpha the guy at 4,000 students<br>each year applying for 160 places but<br>there's also sporting exercise health<br>and wellness is also a very very popular<br>program oh of getting people to study in<br>it for example in the UK it's the eighth<br>two most popular disciplines porn<br>exercise I mean it's quite sad to see<br>but all a lot of the physics and<br>chemistry the all traditional Pulis's is<br>not quite puts answers I've attacking it<br>it's a good thing as an opportunity for<br>the last year in this field the vision<br>they've appointed me the boss he's<br>appointed me so what you really do need<br>if you want something to grow you need<br>to have your CD management support and<br>by appointing myself and some really<br>good stuff in the last few months and<br>encouraging the growth of a new faculty<br>there's a push from the top that we want<br>to<br>this work ERT flourish and you really<br>are love this thing that's marketing tea<br>some great marketing run with it agree<br>and it gets you further that's marketing<br>we need to build marketing and and<br>just having the management support<br>compared to some place our query does<br>help if you were interested senior<br>management and what you developing there<br>it is a strong base we got some top<br>stuff are really some of you in the<br>audience you are really are but a small<br>but a great group of people to start<br>with and you are will reading area and<br>we've got a really good group we've got<br>a program you're going to develop more<br>programs it needs a bit of work but<br>we've got a base that we can develop<br>from<br>we've got on our doorstep some of the<br>best hospitals again Ross sorry again I<br>really but no you showed me the best<br>hospitals on Wednesday I've ever seen<br>you've got fantastic conditions that all<br>of them seem to say they want to work<br>and grow health wet wakita so we've got<br>an outdoors deep end with Ross himself<br>we've got some of the best conditions<br>working here we need to develop and firm<br>up those links and make them courses<br>research programs things like that too<br>they are already the DHB yeah we already<br>have gotten in a dhp and they already<br>are exercising health programs happening<br>around the Wakita we need to link in and<br>work with them have been used in as<br>placements so we really have been a very<br>innovative thb that's doing a lot of the<br>workout that I've talked about we as<br>academics need to build in our training<br>programs that works with the DHB I in<br>there in Iraq at our region<br>we've got that watching rob couldn't be<br>a but we've also got from the sport is<br>really important to have no role models<br>and though arquetta is so rich with<br>successful athletes I mean my Helen and<br>Luke 80 at goodwood and they had three<br>or four Olympic gold medalist in<br>silverman is coming to see them that's<br>the circus rotya at the ratty drab<br>pariet taronga Haskell helpers in a trot<br>the 405 made an illness and yachting<br>with the school there so this place<br>really is the bed breadbasket of<br>athletics shouldn't the growing to<br>alicia lake karapiro we want the bread<br>boss at a sport that is an important<br>driver as an example and as an<br>integrative link with what we were to<br>develop whether it's health wellness or<br>exercise or elite sport provision and<br>her sisters<br>I've never seen that I've lived in a lot<br>of beautiful places in the world to the<br>northeast into theater Maryland kepta<br>but we really in our catcher some of the<br>most beautiful areas I've seen in the<br>world and I've always been surprised in<br>the UK what well they're such good<br>athletes they could as always rains and<br>it's it's very hard to do sport outdoors<br>there I hope it stops raining here<br>sometime but I do you remember I came<br>from an interview this warmer and some<br>blue skies but we can get out there and<br>there's beautiful environment see other<br>people thats easy he had to do sport<br>having a look and the crystal me going<br>on sunday the caterpillar henkka<br>gorgeous one of the most beautiful<br>places I've ever suckle them it's out<br>there we just got to get people one more<br>people using it and training people to<br>help people work out there I've been<br>really expressed by the community spirit<br>the Mahdi spirit the integration of<br>communities and people wanting to work<br>together which in South Africa we still<br>need a little they still need to be a<br>lot of work for example in that area I<br>let this idea that it's the holistic<br>view of of spirit not just physical<br>family mental and spiritual I do you<br>think that that's really important<br>you're just not going to get help from<br>this country in the physical it has to<br>be something that's you bring your<br>family involved every Sunday I trying to<br>soccer with my kids but are the<br>highlights of my week that good as the<br>Box are coming over from Illinois to<br>equal to you have to get the patterns<br>going and I think that's really<br>important that we understand the<br>reporting of health and wellness from a<br>community and not just individual<br>perspective<br>so we need to work together to<br>understand as a team the university the<br>clinicians<br>everybody the sociologists we need to<br>understand too we're together the<br>barriers preventing exercise and the<br>reason why third point exercising our<br>choosing the wrong lifestyle options<br>this is it we research we academics we<br>need to do research and get PhDs masters<br>understanding why are people turning<br>away from sport rather than to where<br>towards it and healthy practice we need<br>to work together to understand what are<br>the best ways to get people to exercise<br>and eat healthily not everybody likes to<br>go to the gym what is the best way<br>everybody different people like<br>exercising and tailor it to what people<br>really want to do some communities and<br>some folk like to play team sports some<br>people have to do sport on the end you<br>need to understand that we need to train<br>people that will understand their<br>difference<br>we need to work together to work out the<br>best wellness strategies about<br>individuals and communities as I've just<br>said I<br>look forward to working with all of you<br>to improve our trading research<br>community engagement and help provision<br>in the field of sport exercise our third<br>wellness answering these questions<br>building programs that can train people<br>to do health and take and improve the<br>health of wellness of the Waikato region<br>an integrated in the board in New<br>Zealand and Internet community in the<br>field<br>let's make a University of Akita<br>Hamilton the Waikato region and New<br>Zealand an even better place to live in<br>be I love this question on a wall<br>somewhere in New Zealand I think let's<br>walk the walk promote physical activity<br>at smart diabetes to live longer and<br>healthier<br>so just to finish off my second last<br>slide what a Sputnik sounds and was it<br>the next magic bullet hopefully I sort<br>of answered it in the last half hour or<br>so<br>but really that these are the RET things<br>as you've got the majority sportin and<br>and what you eat and what your export<br>you do are you to tease you really were<br>to absolute control over you can decide<br>to get up there and run or cycle or swim<br>or canoe whatever your dark doing and<br>you can choose your nutrition patterns<br>and once it gets beyond a certain stage<br>then you in the hands of your GP and<br>then your specialist and those choices<br>get less in this the more you go on the<br>wrong path but if we can make people<br>understand that this is assuming it's a<br>choice that will affect him in 10 or 20<br>or 30 years time and that's really good<br>personally I've worked my sport right<br>I've gotta work on the belt up on the<br>nutrition thanks all of you attending<br>for your support in my first two months<br>here from in our family for helping us<br>to and happy that helped us in the next<br>five to eight years I'm working here at<br>Eastern students participation in the<br>sport exercise health wellness and<br>medical fields in the time I hit it's<br>really nice to see so many much more<br>than I expected I thought I'd have four<br>people yeah being you yeah thank you so<br>much whatever your raft it's a son I<br>think if that health is important sports<br>important exercise finicum work is<br>really important we've got a good<br>nucleus of people we've got a supportive<br>senior management team and I think and I<br>hope that the wood there's going to be<br>some hard times we've got to develop<br>things from scratch it's Anna's<br>challenges involved in that but a very<br>confident in some exciting times ahead<br>in the next five or ideas i'm looking<br>forward to working all of you taking<br>this area forward thank<br>then i go to-- couture i'm bruce<br>clarkson he did levi's chancellor<br>research here at the university of<br>waikato and tonight standing in for our<br>vice-chancellor professor neil Quigley<br>who gives his apologies for not being<br>able to be here tonight so it's my<br>privilege to make some closing remarks<br>following this impressive inaugural<br>lecture by professor Ellen sand clear<br>Gibson or zig as we've come to know him<br>already<br>so it's clear to me that sig is<br>operating at the critical interface<br>between disciplines<br>it's attention zone often between<br>disciplines but it's also the place<br>where innovation occurs where the<br>greatest innovation occurs and the<br>greatest solutions to current problems<br>can be developed<br>here at Waikato University we pride<br>ourselves on new approaches and<br>innovation and you can now see for<br>yourselves why we have appointed Zig<br>he's multi qualified he's multi-talented<br>he's operating across a range of<br>disciplines which are normally<br>had very strong boundaries between them<br>medicine sports science sociology the<br>demography of health and he clearly<br>understands the importance of<br>stakeholders and partnerships in<br>developing new programs<br>our strategy here at Waikato in recent<br>times has been to build our expertise at<br>this critical interface where we know<br>that significant gains and human<br>well-being and health can be made<br>Zig eloquently explained to us the nexus<br>between<br>lifestyle<br>nutrition exercise and modern chronic<br>ailments which paradoxically are leading<br>to a shorter lifespan for the generation<br>he also managed to raise the specter of<br>the South African victory in the World<br>Cup without dwelling on it too long and<br>we did note his thinly veiled request<br>for a building and a whole lot of<br>equipment<br>having said all that though that we do<br>look forward to his upcoming<br>contribution here at Waikato and for him<br>to be able to help us make a difference<br>regionally and nationally to improve the<br>health and well-being of New Zealanders<br>with his focus on prevention<br>so please join with me now to thank him<br>and to finish off please join us at the<br>bar to celebrate his inauguration and<br>ask him the questions that his talk has<br>undone doubtedly provoked from his first<br>class lecture<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
