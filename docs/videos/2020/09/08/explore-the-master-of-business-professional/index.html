business<br>professional is what subjects and<br>courses you can take while you're doing<br>that program<br>i do have my colleague behind the scenes<br>here her name is charlotte<br>and she'll be

questions are going to be<br>answered through the webinar later on<br>then we might just hold off from<br>answering those and we'll answer them<br>live<br>but do definitely send through some<br>questions and we will get to them as we<br>go<br>the first thing is though i would love<br>to know uh who you are<br>where um whereabouts you're located and<br>so we do have a poll just to get us<br>started<br>so charlotte's going to pop that up for<br>us on our screen and if you can say<br>whereabouts<br>you're joining us from whether it's in<br>new zealand and whether it's overseas<br>and whereabouts that might be so we'll<br>give you a little bit of time to answer<br>a couple coming through quite a few in<br>wellington fantastic<br>brilliant a little bit longer<br>oh there we go i think we've got most<br>people answered now so we have a mix<br>we've got a couple of people<br>uh in wellington and overseas so what<br>we're going to do is there'll be an<br>uh oh you can um sorry it still joins<br>there so<br>there's a second poll which asks you<br>about uh where that's from overseas<br>you're joining<br>us if you are from overseas so um we do<br>have people joining us from india so<br>welcome um i'm i think it's a morning<br>there maybe for you as you can see out<br>my window here<br>it's uh we're just losing the sunlight<br>so we are in the evening so<br>thank you for joining us no matter where<br>you may be<br>brilliant so like i said i'm going to<br>talk a little bit about the university<br>and the professional programs before we<br>kick into what the master of business<br>professional<br>is so i i'm not sure how familiar you<br>might be with the university so<br>we are from the wellington school of<br>business and government<br>and that is a faculty here at the<br>university<br>but the university in the whole is uh<br>situated in wellington<br>and you hopefully can see that lovely<br>picture at the bottom of my screen there<br>which shows you uh where we're located<br>around the the capital city<br>so if you can make out the pipette<br>campus i know it will look quite small<br>on your screen<br>down in the bottom um there pippety<br>campus that's where we're located<br>that's the the business school but we do<br>have some other campuses dotted around<br>the city<br>the university itself has about 22 000<br>students uh really diverse range of<br>students from about 16 years old or<br>up to about 92 i think is our oldest<br>student<br>and in the professional programs we<br>we've got a<br>range as well so we're our younger<br>students about 20 and our oldest is<br>uh in in their 70s i believe so we are<br>quite diverse in in our students<br>across the university and in particular<br>so wellington we're for our lovely a<br>couple of overseas people if you don't<br>know wellington i do encourage you to to<br>look it up and and find out a little bit<br>about the city<br>we are the capital city here in in new<br>zealand<br>and so there's some links on the screen<br>now to find out some more information<br>but although we're a capital city it is<br>quite compact<br>it's a really easy city to get around<br>and explore<br>it's got a mix of um being really<br>creative and then<br>um really entrepreneurial and very<br>strong in the business sector so<br>do definitely look at where you might be<br>living and and studying<br>but i'm going to talk like i said about<br>who we are so<br>being the wellington school of business<br>and government and i've zoomed in now on<br>that picture that i was showing you<br>before<br>and hopefully if you do know wellington<br>and know the city you'll be able to make<br>out the beehive which is our um<br>parliament building<br>you might also recognize it it's the<br>building behind me if you can still<br>sneak a peek through the darkness there<br>but about in the center of that picture<br>you'll see the beehive and parliament<br>buildings<br>just behind that building you'll see a<br>tall office looking building<br>and that actually is the wellington<br>school of business and government<br>it's in a pretty amazing place to study<br>and work and and be really in the center<br>of that the business district here<br>so there's another picture zoomed in<br>again so hopefully you can see a little<br>bit more<br>of where we're located so it's the tall<br>building that you can see just just by<br>the beehive and parliament<br>so we really draw on the capital city<br>connections that we have here at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>what you'll find when you're studying<br>your academics will be really heavily<br>involved<br>in um either working in industry or had<br>a really strong background there<br>or they might even be feeding in and<br>shaping policy that's happening<br>and being made just across the road we<br>also have<br>internships in our programs or<br>consultancy projects as we typically<br>call them<br>and that will be where you get hands-on<br>experience going out and working with<br>organizations around the capital city<br>and really developing<br>or utilizing what you're learning in<br>class and putting that into a<br>if you haven't been to the campus before<br>i do encourage you to check it out<br>so like i said we're in rutherford house<br>at the pipeteer campus<br>it's a very modern building the top<br>image there is our library<br>and and we do we're quite lucky for our<br>professional program students<br>we do have dedicated resources and<br>spaces for you to use<br>and so that picture at the bottom that<br>is our dedicated student study space<br>so that space is there for our students<br>for<br>no matter what program you might be<br>studying there's individual study quiet<br>areas there's rooms you can book out<br>there's there's room space for<br>collective study there's a kitchenette<br>free printing<br>everything there to support you while<br>you are studying<br>what we typically find is our students<br>might be working while they are studying<br>about 80 of our students are studying<br>part-time due to<br>having other life commitments and work<br>commitments so this<br>the dedicated space is a really nice<br>area for you to be able to shut away<br>from the world<br>and really focus on your studying and<br>get to network with your other<br>so that's a quite a quick background<br>into who we are and<br>please do ask more questions if you do<br>want to find out more<br>i have done quite a few other webinars<br>though that i do go into more<br>information about what professional<br>programs are<br>so if you are wanting to get some more<br>information i encourage you to check<br>those out as well<br>but we're going to delve a little bit<br>more into the academic side of our<br>programs<br>what are the professional programs and<br>and why you might be interested in<br>joining us in this webinar this evening<br>so when we talk about our professional<br>programs they are professionally focused<br>postgraduate programs here at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>we have 10 programs that fall underneath<br>that heading<br>and we tend to categorize them or we<br>find they suit students particularly<br>in certain career levels or certain<br>career goals<br>so the first one that we have is a<br>career stage for people who are wanting<br>to kick-start their career<br>the programs that fall underneath this<br>category are typically for<br>recent graduates who might not have work<br>experience<br>or people who are wanting to to move<br>into a completely different area but<br>they don't have a background in that at<br>all<br>then we have our change category and<br>that is for people who are<br>working you might have some years of<br>work experience behind you<br>but you're interested in moving into a<br>very different career<br>or you're interested in moving into an<br>industry that you don't really have an<br>academic background or a work experience<br>background<br>and want to move into that so the master<br>of business<br>professional does fall for some people<br>in this category<br>we then have our enhanced category so<br>this category is for people who do<br>have work experience behind them they're<br>currently working in an area or a career<br>that they're really interested in<br>but they're looking at upskilling<br>building on their academic knowledge<br>building on any professional career that<br>they might have and really enhancing<br>that with this<br>with their future qualification to help<br>them move up that career ladder<br>and again for some of our students the<br>master of business professional will<br>fall really nicely in this category as<br>well<br>so i'm going to talk about all of the<br>the options there and why it might suit<br>you whether you're thinking about<br>changing your career<br>and also why it might suit you if you're<br>thinking about and enhancing and<br>upskilling<br>so we're going to talk now like i said<br>about the master of business<br>professional<br>so this program like i said right at the<br>very beginning<br>it is new for us starting in february<br>next year<br>we're really excited about it because<br>we've been doing a lot of research<br>behind the scenes<br>looking into this program and reshaping<br>some of the old ones that we have<br>offered previously<br>so if you have been looking in the past<br>and you've been you're interested in<br>professional economics applied finance<br>and information management<br>and and you've seen that those<br>qualifications might have started to<br>disappear from our website<br>this is a qualification that is is<br>reshaping them<br>and bringing them into this fold now the<br>reason we've done that with these<br>qualifications<br>is we were getting some feedback that<br>students wanted a little bit more<br>flexibility in their program<br>they wanted to specialize in particular<br>subjects maybe pair them with a<br>different specialization<br>but also build a really strong<br>foundation in in business and and<br>leadership<br>and skills in those kinds of areas so<br>that is how our business<br>professional was born<br>so the qualifications that we'll be<br>talking through tonight they all fall<br>under this family that we<br>call the master of business professional<br>but what it means is we have three<br>stages that you can move through or<br>three qualifications<br>and you sometimes might see us we talk<br>about this being called staircasing<br>and that's because your first<br>qualification here the postgraduate<br>certificate<br>it's four of the master's courses so you<br>can decide to enroll into the<br>postgraduate certificate from the<br>beginning<br>complete this set of courses and you<br>could finish there if you were<br>interested<br>if you did though want to keep moving up<br>through the staircase<br>you can then add four courses so eight<br>in total<br>and end up with the postgraduate diploma<br>and finally if you add an additional<br>four courses you can end up with<br>the whole masters so the main difference<br>between these different qualifications<br>is really the number of courses that<br>you'll be completing<br>so all courses are masters courses<br>they're all from that level<br>but it's just if you decide to take<br>fewer and then you would be doing the<br>postgraduate certificate or postgraduate<br>diploma<br>you can enroll in in either of these<br>options or any of these options<br>and and if you don't actually have a<br>bachelor's degree<br>we do still consider people who have a<br>really strong professional background<br>but we do ask that you enroll in the<br>postgraduate certificate first<br>so entry into the business professional<br>qualifications<br>we do require or we do ask you to have a<br>bachelor's degree<br>for most of them and like i said to<br>enroll straight into the masters that's<br>what you need<br>but we can talk to you if you're shy of<br>that<br>and talk about enrolling in that<br>postgraduate certificate<br>now you'll see a little bit of asterisks<br>there which is next to our bachelor's<br>degree<br>and what that refers to is that for some<br>of our specializations<br>in particular the ones that have<br>replaced our professional economics<br>applied finance and information<br>management program we do require you to<br>have<br>academic knowledge in those areas for<br>some of our other specializations and i<br>will go through those uh a little bit<br>later<br>you don't have to have any academic<br>knowledge in those areas<br>so we do the the bottom line is we want<br>you to have a bachelor's degree<br>but definitely talk to us if you're not<br>sure if you meet their entry criteria<br>you'll see as well we do require you to<br>have at least two years of professional<br>work experience<br>so this is why when i was talking about<br>before we had those different career<br>stages<br>we do require students to have uh two<br>years of professional work experience<br>and that helps us shape your your<br>courses and your learning<br>our classes are really interactive and<br>although<br>you're learning academic content we're<br>also teaching you professional skills<br>and building on the professional<br>knowledge that you already have<br>so it is a requirement for us for to<br>have students with that work experience<br>and the asterisks again does indicate<br>for certain specializations<br>we do ask you to have a professional<br>work experience<br>in some particular areas for our<br>international students who are joining<br>us this evening you do also need to<br>provide proof of english proficiency and<br>that is listed on our website if you're<br>not too sure about that<br>this qualification it starts like i said<br>in february next year<br>so our applications are just about to<br>open for that one so they're open in a<br>now i'm going to talk a little bit about<br>the structure of the qualifications and<br>and i did say before that you can do<br>your certificate diploma or masters<br>and and how it works is that the<br>programs overall have a mix of core<br>courses<br>um and elective courses now the core<br>courses they're there to give you a<br>really strong foundation<br>in problem solving organizational skills<br>leadership skills<br>things like that to really help you with<br>your professional career<br>the electives they're courses for you to<br>take um<br>interest courses or even you can that's<br>where you bring in your specialization<br>so for the postgraduate certificate if<br>you are interested in this qualification<br>you're required to complete one of the<br>core courses and then you get to choose<br>three electives<br>for a specialization is typically three<br>courses you need to complete<br>so you could do a specialization in the<br>postgraduate certificate<br>for our postgraduate diploma you need to<br>do<br>three of the core courses we have<br>available and then five elective courses<br>and finally for the full masters it's<br>four core courses<br>and eight electives so in the master's<br>qualification students can choose to<br>take two specializations<br>and i know i keep talking about<br>specializations i will show you what<br>they are<br>um a little bit further now the courses<br>that we have on offer<br>they can be taken in in a flexible order<br>so we don't have for most of the<br>subjects we don't have set courses that<br>you need to complete before others<br>for some of them we do so we do<br>recommend that you come and talk to us<br>about<br>course planning if you are interested in<br>this qualification<br>and but most of the time they are quite<br>flexible<br>so here are the core courses that i keep<br>talking about<br>so like i said for the masses you need<br>to complete four<br>of them you will see five on on my<br>screen<br>so the courses are there to to like i<br>said before to give you that really<br>strong foundation<br>in in business and and you can pick and<br>choose what ones might suit your career<br>goals better the one at the bottom there<br>the interdisciplinary project<br>this one is a little bit different from<br>the others where i said you can take<br>them in a really flexible order<br>we do ask that you take your<br>interdisciplinary project<br>at the end of your qualification and the<br>reason for this is<br>that this quality this course is there<br>to<br>build on the knowledge the academic and<br>the professional<br>knowledge that you've learned throughout<br>your program and then you go and work<br>with an organization<br>typically in a group with people from<br>different specializations<br>you who work on a project brief for them<br>you do a report<br>and and then at the end of it you you've<br>got that<br>hands-on work experience as well so we<br>will find students be most successful in<br>this course<br>if they do take it at the end of their<br>qualification<br>so here are the specializations and i<br>appreciate there's quite a bit of<br>writing on the screen<br>so hopefully you can read that but there<br>is more information on our website<br>if you do go to our master of business<br>professional web page<br>under the study details tab it will give<br>you some more information about these<br>specializations here<br>and i will say before i go into more<br>information about them<br>please have a look see what ones<br>interest you<br>we are really fortunate that this<br>qualification is a reality<br>because it's a new one we do have some<br>uh<br>scope to make it what students are<br>really looking for<br>so we did do a lot of research before we<br>bought this qualification out<br>and but we still have some scope to to<br>offer certain courses<br>and it's in particular if we do get a<br>lot of students enrolling in particular<br>ones<br>we we can shape the course and<br>qualification a little<br>bit so we're really grateful you're<br>joining us tonight we are going to put a<br>couple of polls at the end of when i've<br>spoken through the specializations<br>just to find out a little bit more about<br>what you're interested in<br>and potentially the way that you're<br>wanting to to learn through<br>online delivery and in person and things<br>like that<br>so i will now talk about the<br>specializations<br>so the first one here is financial<br>analysis<br>now you'll see my asterisk again and<br>that's because<br>you do need to have a background in<br>finance or or<br>um particularly maths and things like<br>that to be successful in this<br>specialization<br>so you'll look at things like global<br>financial markets<br>and risk management and sorry<br>international corporate finance<br>so you'll see some of those courses<br>listed on my screen<br>we also have investment management so<br>again it's a<br>similar one in the applied finance range<br>and that's looking at financial modeling<br>um portfolios um and other subjects like<br>that and it does also require you to<br>have<br>a financial background and work<br>and academic<br>now we're moving on to our contemporary<br>economics so these next three<br>specializations i'm going to talk<br>through are from our professional<br>economic subjects<br>and but the contemporary economics is a<br>little bit different to the other two<br>that i'm going to talk about<br>because this doesn't require you to have<br>a background in economics<br>so uh you look at things uh that cover<br>so look at economics and things areas<br>like psychology or<br>government public policy geography and<br>so you do take a variety of different<br>courses here from a variety of different<br>disciplines<br>the next one in our economic category is<br>economic thinking<br>and this is what people traditionally or<br>typically might think of with economics<br>so you're looking at macro your<br>micro economics and looking at the<br>applications of it<br>and then we have macro economics which<br>is our final specialization in the<br>economics pathway<br>and this one here is looking at areas<br>like international trade<br>and welfare business cycles and the<br>courses they do<br>reflect those typical areas so<br>i will before i keep going i will<br>reiterate so for a specialization<br>if you are interested in these subjects<br>you do need to take three courses<br>from the the specialization area but you<br>can also mix and match and take elective<br>courses from different areas<br>under the master of business<br>professional<br>now the next two specializations i'm<br>going to talk to are information<br>management<br>specializations so the first one is<br>applied data analytics<br>so as the name suggests you're looking<br>at data analytics and then about<br>storing and accessing data and you're<br>looking at machine learning automation<br>all of these things which are really<br>quite innovative and fast paced<br>in the information management area<br>and we also have digital transformation<br>and leadership<br>so this these courses are looking at<br>cyber security<br>looking at digital systems um and then<br>looking at things like governance and<br>the i.t<br>sector and and looking at how you can<br>grow businesses<br>with thinking about i.t and digital<br>tech and<br>my final two specializations that i'm<br>going to<br>touch on tonight are two qualif<br>specializations that don't require you<br>to have work experience<br>in these areas so the first one is<br>entrepreneurship innovation and<br>commercialization<br>and you'll see on the screen that's a<br>really wide range of things that do get<br>covered here so you'll look at things<br>like management and marketing<br>and some uh legal courses or<br>topics uh financial so it's really<br>giving you the scope and the skills to<br>be successful in in what your business<br>venture might be<br>and we also have the sustainable<br>business so again this is uh<br>uh interdisciplinary you're looking at<br>sustainable business courses you're<br>looking at ethics and governance<br>and you're looking at sustainable<br>business in the digital world<br>so you will see that some of these<br>courses have have appeared in different<br>specializations<br>and and in the ones that they're being<br>taught in as well so<br>it is a really flexible qualification<br>you can<br>pick and choose like i've said the<br>courses and the subjects that you're<br>interested in<br>you can also pair specialization so you<br>could be really interested in<br>a digital leadership and transformation<br>you have the it background<br>which is two years of working in<br>information management and i.t<br>sectors but then you're also really<br>interested<br>in combining it with sustainable<br>business and you compare those two<br>now something that we're quite proud of<br>and and the professional programs<br>is that we we want your qualification to<br>be<br>really valuable to you we want you to<br>take courses that you're actually going<br>to build from<br>and and really help your career so<br>because we look after all of the<br>professional programs here<br>we can be really flexible with looking<br>at what courses that you're interested<br>in taking<br>now like i mentioned at the beginning of<br>this webinar we do have 10<br>qualifications that fall under the<br>professional program<br>umbrella and if you are really<br>interested in subjects that technically<br>fall from a different qualification<br>for example our global business<br>qualification you can actually take<br>courses from there<br>and bring it into your master of<br>business professional<br>so i've popped some other subjects on<br>the screen here<br>of of cour subjects that people have<br>been asking me about lately<br>so don't just look at the<br>specializations uh you<br>you definitely can but there are other<br>options and we can work out<br>other specializations for example you<br>could look at specializing in marketing<br>as well<br>so the specializations i've gone through<br>in more detail<br>they are particular to the master of<br>business professional<br>but you can definitely widen your scope<br>and have a look at what's available<br>throughout the whole wellington school<br>of business and government so<br>hopefully that's given you a little bit<br>of an understanding about the<br>specializations<br>i appreciate i talk quite quickly um and<br>i'm giving you a lot of<br>information to digest in in one go what<br>we are going to do though<br>is is take a break so you don't have to<br>listen to me for a little bit longer<br>and we're going to do some polls just to<br>find out<br>has there been anything that sparked<br>your interest from the specializations<br>this evening<br>so what might interest you and also um<br>how you're interested in learning if<br>you're are you<br>interested in coming on campus to do<br>this qualification<br>um or are you interested in doing it<br>online through<br>recorded lectures or live lectures<br>so we do just want to get your thoughts<br>so we're going to pop<br>two polls up they are separate i believe<br>so we'll do one poll first<br>get everyone's thoughts and then we'll<br>we'll lead with the other one so we'll<br>well we've got a quite quite a range<br>actually coming up<br>um perfect quite a few in that<br>information management space<br>also same in in financial analysis<br>sustainable business looking quite<br>popular<br>oh in contemporary economics i think<br>we're ticking off nearly all of the<br>specializations<br>so it's really exciting for us to see<br>that lots of people are interested in<br>lots of<br>lots of different areas we are going to<br>i think we still have some people who<br>haven't answered but<br>um we'll give it 10 more seconds and<br>then we'll move on to the next poll<br>which is just looking at how<br>perfect we'll shut that poll off now and<br>we'll put the second<br>so this next poll like i said is about<br>how you're interested in learning<br>whether it's online<br>um whether it's which is a live delivery<br>so you're zooming into classes<br>dealing uh working with the academics<br>and other colleagues<br>um we've got recorded self-paced so<br>that's where we'd put it up<br>and you'll be able to interact with it<br>in your own time or on campus<br>face to face so you're in your classes<br>and with with your other students<br>you've got quite a mix of results coming<br>through there<br>um<br>face-to-face looking pretty popular and<br>but then people are interested in the<br>other two<br>options and you are welcome to click all<br>that applies if you're<br>you're happy with whatever then feel<br>perfect we'll give this one 10 more<br>seconds and thank you so much for<br>for giving us your feedback we do<br>encourage<br>uh you to do that with us so if after<br>the session you<br>you do want to talk a little bit more<br>about your options you might be not<br>based in wellington i see a couple more<br>people have joined us from since<br>we started the webinar so if you are out<br>of wellington and interested in<br>exploring your options<br>let us know because then we can um we<br>can talk more and and find out about<br>what<br>what you're interested in how you are<br>interested in learning<br>brilliant so for the last uh 10 minutes<br>before we break for<br>questions it's just thinking about your<br>next steps<br>what you need to be doing if you're<br>interested in pursuing this<br>qualification<br>so there are a few things to be thinking<br>about here<br>so we do have um five kind of areas that<br>we're going to talk through this evening<br>the first one is thinking about<br>international students<br>now i know that we do have a couple of<br>international students joining us this<br>evening<br>um and that we're getting a lot of<br>questions at the moment<br>about visa requirements entry<br>requirements<br>our borders all of those kinds of things<br>we have an amazing team called the<br>wellington university international team<br>and they're there to answer all of those<br>questions for you<br>they can talk about entry requirements<br>uh the english<br>proficiency requirements that i<br>mentioned but then also coach you<br>through or help you with visas<br>connect you with agents if you find that<br>an easier way to go through this<br>and also talk about scholarships so on<br>the very last<br>slide that i'm going to put up i'm going<br>to put up our contact details<br>which will have contact details for me<br>but then also our wellington university<br>international team<br>so if you are an international student<br>and do want to find out more about<br>anything i have listed<br>on the screen here i do recommend<br>definitely get in touch with them<br>and they'll be able to help you the next<br>thing though is looking<br>at financing your study and looking at<br>how much it might cost you to do this<br>quite these qualifications<br>now the fees that i have on this uh<br>screen today they<br>are for um sorry i've realized i've put<br>20 20 on there they are actually in fact<br>2021 um fees and<br>you might not find them on the website<br>just yet they've they've just<br>been announced today so there are<br>approximate fees and we will be putting<br>out more information on the website<br>shortly<br>but the fees that i have here they are<br>for our masters program<br>so if you are interested in doing the<br>certificate and the diploma that i've<br>mentioned a couple of times you you'll<br>pay<br>you pay per course that you complete so<br>and they are a little bit cheaper but<br>again you can find out more information<br>on the website<br>but thinking about how you're going to<br>fund your study we do get asked this a<br>fair bit<br>and we recommend that first you look<br>into scholarships<br>now the scholarships link that i have on<br>the website<br>that that link shows you all victoria<br>university of wellington scholarships<br>and even some private scholarships that<br>we find out about and we put it in our<br>scholarship database<br>i recommend that you have a look into<br>this and see what's available<br>and we do actually have scholarships<br>that tend to appear<br>and so i do recommend if you have a look<br>today and can't find anything that that<br>suits you right now<br>keep having a look um because you never<br>know what is going to come on the<br>website<br>another thing that we recommend people<br>look into is<br>looking through study link so this is<br>for our domestic students<br>if you are interested in um get seeking<br>a student loan<br>that's quite a common way for our<br>students to fund their study<br>then study link other people to do this<br>through<br>they support undergraduate but also<br>postgraduate students<br>so if you did get them for your<br>undergraduate qualification<br>you'll know them very well but jump on<br>their website<br>fill out a survey and it will tell you<br>what you're eligible for<br>typically what happens with our students<br>is they get a loan from from study link<br>up front to pay for their fees<br>and but what happens is you pay your<br>loan back through<br>through working so they take a certain<br>amount out of your pay<br>and a lot of our students do actually<br>pay their qualification off<br>um or nearly paid off by the time<br>they've finished studying<br>through that system um and the final one<br>i will mention because i've had a couple<br>of questions about this lately<br>is the fees free scheme now this is for<br>people who were<br>right at the beginning i said you might<br>not have a bachelor's degree<br>so if you haven't got a tertiary<br>qualification before<br>and but you have a wealth of work<br>experience and you're interested in<br>studying one of our programs<br>then have a look on the fees free<br>website and see if you're eligible for<br>there are um other ways to thinking<br>about finance as well<br>it's quite good to talk to your employer<br>if your employer is supportive of you<br>doing further study<br>and and we will have a publication<br>coming out shortly with some things<br>or ways to approach your employer and<br>how to ask them to<br>provide support that might be financial<br>support<br>but what we do find quite common is<br>people say<br>you can have some time off to go and and<br>do your study<br>and or more lenient around if you have<br>busy<br>um exam periods or assignment periods<br>and things like that<br>now looking at the application side of<br>things so<br>we do have two different application<br>processes whether you're an<br>international student<br>or whether you're a domestic student so<br>international students we ask that you<br>apply with wellington university<br>international<br>you then have your admission approved<br>you receive a thing called an offer of<br>place<br>and then we wait for you to accept your<br>offer of place and say yep you're<br>interested in starting<br>and the program with us now applications<br>for the<br>trimester one start which is our<br>february start for this qualification<br>they do close on the 1st of december<br>for our domestic students it's similar<br>and you<br>also have to apply but you do this by<br>applying online<br>we then ask you to submit some documents<br>and that's your<br>your cv and your academic transcript<br>you then also get your admission<br>approved um and we send this to you<br>and we send something called an offer of<br>study<br>if you're happy with your offer of study<br>you click accept and<br>and then that comes back to us and<br>you're fully enrolled in the program<br>so
