this<br>physical space here at old government<br>house at<br>university of auckland or elsewhere<br>wherever you may find yourself<br>hopefully you're ready for an engaging<br>discussion on<br>river futures in aotearoa that's the<br>event that we're orchestrating here<br>before we start i'd just like to ask dan<br>hickarow to come up to<br>okay<br>um thanks immensely dan for<br>um opening words<br>on behalf of the head of school julie<br>roland<br>and the research committee for the<br>school of environment<br>here at the university of auckland i'm<br>delighted to welcome you to this event<br>my name is gary briley i'm chair of<br>physical geography<br>i'm a professor in the school of<br>environment here at the university of<br>auckland<br>um in light of a crazy<br>2020 a uh ever-changing circumstances<br>as we've certainly had experience of<br>just this very week<br>the research committee at the university<br>of auckland in the school<br>decided to replace the annual invited<br>lectures<br>for this year to make this one<br>event this research forum so this<br>research forum replaces<br>the bathroom lecture for earth sciences<br>for 2020<br>the cumberland lecture for geography for<br>2020<br>and the hay lecture for environmental<br>sciences for 2020. so we put<br>everything together in one grab bag<br>so that's what you're going to<br>experience for the next 90 minutes or so<br>this um research forum entitled river<br>futures in aotearoa<br>encapsulates the kinds of breadth of<br>issues that we<br>study in the school of environment right<br>the transdisciplinary practices<br>governance framings alongside our role<br>in the faculty of science here at the<br>university of auckland<br>the event is something of an experiment<br>right as we try things out<br>in multiple ways here and obviously we<br>hope that you find it both<br>interesting and useful<br>as a starting premise we'd argue that<br>many people in aotearoa care com<br>care passionately about our rivers and<br>the state of our rivers<br>the well-being of rivers their aura<br>provides a measure<br>of our own well-being somehow it seems<br>part<br>of the kiwi psyche this relationship<br>it's perhaps appropriate that for those<br>of us who are<br>here in person we're in<br>or adjacent to old government house<br>because<br>this provides me us a reminder<br>of how past institutional framings<br>shaped what happens to our river systems<br>today<br>the state that they're in and the<br>trajectories of those river systems<br>and at the same time the institutional<br>frameworks that we come up with<br>shape what the future of rivers is going<br>to be like<br>in this country so we have an<br>opportunity and a prospect<br>to look at those shame<br>this type of event and the range of<br>speakers<br>prompts us to reflect upon ancestral<br>connections<br>to river systems to respect<br>their diversity to consider the rights<br>of the river<br>to consider the role of rivers<br>i hope during this event we can engage<br>in generative discussions<br>to consider what steps we need to take<br>to look after our rivers and to enhance<br>their condition<br>in global terms aotearoa is a very<br>special place<br>for looking at these kinds of issues in<br>fact a whole range of institutional<br>responses to<br>across the world people are looking to<br>people here<br>for guidance a sense of hope in how we<br>can<br>shape future agendas there's a growing<br>river<br>a growing movement in different parts of<br>the world for river cultures<br>and aotearoa should lie at the heart<br>in these fast changing and uncertain<br>times it's important to see river<br>management as an ongoing commitment<br>the way we relate to river systems not<br>as a series or a collection of projects<br>in this light it's important to look<br>after<br>the values of each river system not<br>setting out to make river systems the<br>same<br>respecting the inherent diversity and<br>values<br>of each and every river system<br>this entails use of best available<br>knowledge<br>to support the manage of each river<br>system looking at this<br>in alongside local knowledges and<br>connections<br>to local values and relations for each<br>of our river systems<br>but we're in adverse land how do these<br>issues play out<br>in urban and rural settings<br>how will such framings be reimagined<br>within revised versions of the rma<br>how will we enhance prospects for rivers<br>to speak for themselves into the future<br>these are some of the themes that will<br>be discussed<br>in today's workshop the inspiration for<br>this workshop<br>was seeded a couple of years ago at a<br>conference in kirikori roller<br>right it was a conference on the<br>organized by the international society<br>for river science when it was on<br>integrating multiple values in river<br>management that was the theme of the<br>conference<br>but the most important thing that i<br>noted at that event<br>was just how many young<br>passionate enthusiastic individuals were<br>in that room<br>just what what can we do to shape<br>prospects for that next generation of<br>practitioners<br>to engage generatively in looking after<br>our river systems<br>what kind of work will those people be<br>doing in the future<br>what kinds of roles and what kinds of<br>institutions will they be a part of<br>how will they be supported to fulfill<br>their ambitions their aspirations in<br>that work<br>what knowledge bases will inform<br>practice what policy and legislative<br>frameworks will they be working within<br>we're constantly reshaping those agendas<br>and that presents<br>lots of opportunities for us to move<br>forward so hopefully<br>this event can move into some of those<br>spaces right in the time that we have<br>the format for the event is as follows<br>we have five<br>invited panelists that reflect a range<br>of different perspectives<br>and background interests and on these<br>issues<br>and i've asked five colleagues past or<br>present from within the school of<br>environment to provide brief<br>introductions right for each of these<br>panelists just to<br>give a bit of idea um for the spread of<br>interest in the school<br>and i've also approached um protagonists<br>or<br>colleagues to ask questions towards the<br>end to give some focal point for the<br>discussion right as we move forward<br>through this<br>um that will take place after all of the<br>presentations have occurred so we'll go<br>through the five panelists first and<br>then we'll<br>have chance for some general discussion<br>and<br>those questions will be posed and there<br>will be an opportunity<br>using a function called slideo or slido<br>or whatever it's called<br>for others who are outside to put<br>questions forward and then we can<br>um sift through that to get a sense of<br>what<br>general interest may be on particular<br>topics or themes<br>anyway that's enough from me i'll want<br>to move on<br>as quickly as i can i've used my<br>allocated time so<br>let's get into this and we have the<br>first<br>of the introductions um that will be<br>made by naremu and we can proceed<br>my name is and<br>i currently am doing honours in<br>geography um learning from john tunney<br>cliff<br>and gary braley which has been an<br>absolute privilege<br>and learning lots about rivers so i can<br>love heal and protect my<br>hour and they asked me if i could get<br>gerard albert along<br>for this talk tonight um who has<br>been a lead negotiator in the legal<br>personhood<br>of the women river and so much more than<br>that<br>um one of our eb leaders and really<br>knowledgeable<br>and a really great person to have my<br>life<br>foreign<br>um and i greet everyone that's gathered<br>together in auckland to light<br>as i sit in winery<br>inside my house and stare out at the<br>river<br>um i'm sorry i can't be there in pearson<br>tonight but<br>this is the next best thing and in any<br>sense<br>both the single lanes on our bridges are<br>working at the moment so<br>i'm going to try and share screen now<br>and present a<br>short presentation of less than 10<br>minutes<br>sorry<br>now back everyone normal um i have to<br>figure out how to share the screen sorry<br>ah<br>i might have to pass it over to the next<br>speaker and come back<br>so i can sort out my um my share screen<br>2020 moment i think that we've all been<br>forever adjusting as we<br>contemplate complex adaptive systems and<br>that adaption word is certainly a very<br>uh integral part of how we're<br>approaching things right now<br>um i think we will as gerard just<br>suggested we'll just move<br>directly on to the um introduction<br>for uh and salmon so i think hopefully<br>chris<br>you've got that in place and we can just<br>move on to that<br>it is an honour and a privilege to be<br>able to introduce professor dame ann<br>salmon our next speaker this evening<br>but it's not without its challenges my<br>instructions were to keep it short<br>which feels like an almost impossible<br>task given all of her accomplishments<br>and achievements<br>so arahamai for having to rush this<br>introduction<br>which does not do justice to a woman of<br>such high esteem<br>professor dame ann salmon is a<br>distinguished professor of maori studies<br>and anthropology<br>here at te fari wananga o tamaki makoto<br>she is an author historian<br>anthropologist<br>public scholar working beyond the<br>academy environmentalist<br>the recipient of numerous awards and<br>honours including new zealander of the<br>year in 2013<br>and she even has her own wikipedia page<br>through her work she has sought to work<br>across<br>time space and worlds to explore and<br>understand who we are<br>as a nation of different peoples<br>to understand where we've come from how<br>we fit in the world<br>and where we might be headed<br>i am personally inspired by her work on<br>ontological<br>difference and inconsistencies and what<br>this means in terms of thinking about<br>how we relate to other people<br>things and beings so i'm very excited<br>that she is able to be with us here<br>tonight<br>and um i'm looking out<br>at what to kill the local mona<br>i have a stream on one side of me the<br>way to here i've got another stream on<br>the other side the waikido<br>they both run into the waimata river<br>which is flowing<br>just just behind me and so i feel<br>completely surrounded by waterways and<br>the topic of<br>this research forum i was<br>kind of thinking that gerard would be uh<br>introducing us to maori but um i'll say<br>a few<br>a few words which i know that he will be<br>able to speak to<br>in much greater depth in detail um but<br>in tia maori um as i've learned over<br>many years<br>of instruction by people like gerard<br>and tomato like edwardo sterling and<br>others<br>rivers are born from the primal parents<br>from<br>uh the sky father<br>mother and<br>they are a being from whom all life<br>descends<br>and at the beginning of the world where<br>nanny and papa were forcibly separated<br>by their austin they went<br>before papatuan<br>and his tears became the rivers that<br>flow upon the land at least in some<br>accounts of what is in lakes<br>and so here i am surrounded by waterways<br>and jarrod was saying to be on the tap<br>before<br>he was saying um<br>the whale water flows in all directions<br>off the whales back<br>and our rivers need to flow clear and<br>clean<br>and he's talking about i guess uh the<br>great fish<br>which is maori he's on one fluke<br>and to say how low do i am on the other<br>inside opposite the other side of the<br>island<br>and in this kind of way of thinking<br>humans and rivers are linked up with all<br>other life forms<br>and landscape elements in a very complex<br>web of relationships sucker papa<br>genealogy but it's<br>not really genealogical genealogy in the<br>in the western sense because it improves<br>all lifetimes<br>and the rights and responsibilities<br>between the different elements in the<br>world<br>are derived from these ancestral<br>relationships<br>the nurseries the plants and animals the<br>irrigators and producers of kai<br>food dwelling places of punished by the<br>powerful<br>ancestral beings and their mature<br>highways to eels and fish and for people<br>in their goods<br>and markers of memories of boundaries<br>connections events and ancestors<br>indeed their ancestors themselves<br>and at the same time people identify<br>themselves with rivers<br>introducing themselves with the names of<br>their ancestors<br>rivers and mountains and they can look<br>from here and<br>that zero would use it first but he'll<br>be coming soon<br>uh in these ways of thinking these ideas<br>of order and muscle<br>um sickness degradation<br>is dying so am i but also order<br>they're easily grasp these kinds of<br>ideas and they operate at different<br>scales<br>so they can apply design complex dynamic<br>networks of relationships<br>among individuals communities<br>with within ecosystems in nations<br>or the plant the plants itself can be in<br>a state of muscle<br>many people would think that's exactly<br>what's going on at the moment<br>so i thought i'd talk very briefly um<br>about<br>a project that i'm involved in with gary<br>with dan<br>um had some links with gerrard in some<br>of this work as well<br>and a number of others uh the voice of<br>the river project<br>where we're seeking to understand the<br>lives of rivers<br>based on exchanges between different<br>not just different knowledge systems but<br>different<br>ways of being in the world and different<br>and the one hand<br>and science on the other<br>so the framing of our project is<br>relational<br>and interconnected with a whakapapa<br>framing<br>on this side and ideas of<br>so that engaging with rivers as<br>ancestral beings<br>and with a complex systems approach on<br>the other where we're seeing<br>rivers of living communities of land and<br>water<br>and trying to trace their trajectories<br>through space<br>and time and this philosophical approach<br>is grounded in the colonial history of<br>altera<br>and it's aiming to transcend the limits<br>of modernist science<br>by creating dialogue between scholars<br>and practitioners<br>to draw on different cultural<br>the urgency of this kind of inquiry is<br>provoked by what i see as a causal link<br>between fractured siloed approaches to<br>river science and management<br>based on ancient western dichotomies<br>and ideas about rivers<br>and other living systems as resources<br>created for human purposes<br>and waterways on the other hand that are<br>increasingly polluted<br>choked by sediment nearly all the rivers<br>including the way nepal on the east<br>coast and said after<br>choking to death degrading and dying<br>so we have a master proposal that we<br>we're waiting to hear about<br>um which is called let the river speak<br>and here we are trying to foster<br>innovative exchanges between different<br>ways<br>of thinking as well as different<br>disciplines so this is not really a<br>transdisciplinary project<br>it's between different ways of being and<br>knowing<br>about brothers as well as about<br>different disciplinary approaches<br>and we're trying to work<br>at the same time very hand-in-glove with<br>local communities<br>including local and central government<br>agencies<br>farmers foresters riverside residents<br>businesses and those who paddle rose<br>swim<br>fish in our river<br>um in the rivers and also<br>on a range of practical interventions<br>that are aimed at restoring<br>rivers to a state of order thriving<br>prosperous full of life<br>uh and that's not just the river itself<br>but its plants its animals and its<br>people<br>we we are hoping that this kind of<br>relational<br>outcome focus kind of research might be<br>able to transcend<br>modernist divisions between theory and<br>practice<br>people in the environment culture and<br>nature<br>and to re revitalize overlooked<br>genealogies<br>including those in in western science<br>that link<br>the arts to humanities technology<br>we've already had a pilot project with<br>gary and<br>quite a number of staff and students<br>from the<br>school of environment where we've worked<br>on the weymouth tower among other rivers<br>in jesbourne<br>and gary and his colleagues and i've had<br>a role in this and so has dan<br>have come up with some very innovative<br>analysis and analyses of the<br>geomorphological<br>rights of rivers very much inspired by<br>the whanganui river<br>the te awatupua act and its flaming<br>but also new approaches to rivers<br>governance<br>and we're now in the marsden interested<br>in expanding these relations and<br>connections to investigate topics that<br>include<br>links between river pollution and the<br>health of all the lifeforms<br>in and around the river including people<br>forest ecology and new ways of working<br>with river communities<br>to restore them to a flourishing state<br>um and we're working as i mentioned with<br>the waimata river in just form<br>graduate students working with local<br>farmers with foresters<br>experts waka-ama paddlers<br>kayakers swimmers and surfers to try and<br>bring<br>this river community land water plants<br>animals<br>foreign<br>thank you very much kia ora good<br>afternoon everyone my name is christiane<br>allen<br>and i am the associate director of<br>koitu the center for informed futures a<br>new research center here at the<br>university<br>but through the vision and<br>strategic approach of your own hod<br>here at the school of environment jr i<br>also get to spend some time<br>here at the school of environment and so<br>i<br>am very pleased to be part of this<br>discussion<br>today um one of the things that i work<br>on is<br>issues of policy dynamics for really<br>difficult entrenched difficult<br>long-term sort of slow burn problems<br>where there are complex<br>societal values on the one hand and<br>technical issues on the other and i dare<br>say that<br>river futures in aotearoa is qualifies<br>as just such an issue<br>and so i have the pleasure of<br>introducing someone whom i think<br>really has sat at the the epicenter<br>of um just how complex this really gets<br>for a long time so trish kirkland smith<br>is now the head of environmental<br>partnerships at fonterra<br>and before that she had had led the<br>company's approach<br>to environmental and sustainability in<br>new zealand and globally so now she's<br>heading<br>it's really spearheading that whole<br>approach and came to that<br>uh from being the national manager for<br>the living water partnership which was<br>as i understand it a a a public-private<br>partnership between fonterra and doc so<br>had previously been on the dock side<br>and now looking at the fonterra side so<br>i think she's probably seen<br>seen it all so we're really delighted to<br>have you here and look forward to<br>hearing what you have to share thank you<br>thank you for the kind introduction<br>definitely at the epicentre<br>it feels like thanks gary for the invite<br>to be on the panel um a real privilege<br>and i hope i can offer just a small<br>contribution which is<br>to a really um big discussion and<br>i've i've taken the questions quite<br>literally that we were asked<br>and hopefully we can work our way<br>through that<br>don't know how to get the presentation<br>up<br>so gary um asked us what could the<br>future look like for<br>our rivers in atera and new zealand and<br>i was thinking well that's quite a<br>refreshing and positive thing for me to<br>ponder<br>because normally we're just looking at<br>all the problems<br>i'm just doing at full speed just go<br>down that one there that one<br>so what could it look like<br>for me this you know this is my personal<br>view<br>i would like it to be a future where<br>we've reframed our<br>relationship with nature we would have<br>realized that<br>caring for nature regenerating nature is<br>needed<br>for our survival not the survival of the<br>planet actually the survival<br>of our species and that healthy water<br>healthy ecosystems are needed for um<br>for people to be healthy and for<br>communities to really thrive<br>it would be a future where our<br>extractive business models<br>no longer existed um our institutions<br>and our<br>legislation um and our policy settings<br>would actually reflect that<br>and there would be a strong<br>katyakitanga approach to resource<br>management<br>i think we would have embraced diversity<br>that's of<br>we would have easy ways for people to be<br>involved in determining<br>what the future of our our our<br>regions and our communities looked and<br>felt like<br>we would have built resilience into our<br>natural systems<br>into our communities and and also into<br>our businesses<br>we would have looked to nature for the<br>solutions<br>instead of just engineering and<br>dominating nature<br>and in in relying on technological fixes<br>and fundamentally our landscapes would<br>look and feel different<br>there would be space for nature our<br>rivers<br>our streams would meander in natural<br>courses there would be biodiverse<br>ecosystems<br>in rural landscapes and urban landscapes<br>and that's the kind of future that i<br>personally kind of want to<br>live in and i would hope that that would<br>also be doing the right thing<br>for our rivers so we were asked to think<br>i think we should be embracing our<br>unique history<br>our culture we need to learn the stories<br>of the land<br>from the people of the land we need to<br>learn<br>through we need to learn the the place<br>names the<br>you know the names of our waterways that<br>that muddy have them known for<br>you know all of this time that you know<br>we can dismiss<br>and not reflect on um<br>i think we need to<br>we need to resolve our grievances and<br>and really at the end of it it's<br>it's as simple as honoring the treaty<br>i think we should be acknowledging the<br>past and<br>and we need to learn from the past it<br>wasn't that long ago that we were<br>incentivizing<br>the draining of wetlands and the damning<br>of rivers<br>and you know it's<br>you can't blame the people for but for<br>behaving in the context that they were<br>in<br>but we can learn from that and<br>it's taken us generations to get to<br>where we are now<br>and it's really going to be<br>it's going to take a while to unwind<br>that we have<br>we have had narratives and reinforced<br>mindsets<br>and that's really difficult stuff to<br>work on for people<br>but we do need our mindsets to change<br>and<br>we need to do that faster than they've<br>ever changed before<br>we should employ new frameworks<br>frameworks that recognise<br>ecological and social<br>dimensions not just economic so<br>framework like<br>kate rowers donut economics we need an<br>ecological accounting system<br>that's fit for the future we want we<br>need to<br>true cost things we need to true price<br>things we need to<br>truly incentivize in the right ways<br>and we should be embracing um<br>transparency<br>and the the verification of how we're<br>progressing<br>as a nation that relies on our<br>biological economy<br>for for growing food and for tourism i<br>think<br>you know this is really critical that we<br>we show the progress we're making and<br>i think it could be a huge advantage to<br>us as well<br>and i think we should be racing to<br>restore and regenerate<br>rather than what it feels like right now<br>which is racing to<br>the bottom lines and the minimums i<br>personally think we've<br>we've put too much energy in fighting<br>over the minimums<br>and we actually know we all know that<br>more needs to be done<br>for restoring our rivers and our water<br>bodies but we've been just focusing on<br>being<br>a bit less bad minimising our impacts<br>mitigating around the edges so<br>we really should be thinking about how<br>how can we be doing more good<br>how can we be regenerative um<br>how can we race toward aspiration rather<br>than<br>minimums but what do we have to do to<br>get there well<br>there's a lot um it's a big question<br>thanks gary<br>um and i've got a bit of a shopping list<br>and i am going to<br>basically read it so bear with me um<br>signals we need the right signals from<br>leaders from policy settings from<br>communities<br>from consumers there are two main<br>factors that drive<br>change in the farming sector that's<br>price<br>and regulations there are social and<br>cultural factors that also impact that<br>i'm not<br>just you know discrediting that but the<br>big drivers are prices<br>price and regulation and so these are<br>critical signals that we've got to get<br>right<br>i think we need some new language we<br>talk about drains not streams<br>we talk about primary<br>sector not the ecological economy you<br>know and the definition of primary<br>sector is<br>industries involved in the in the<br>extraction<br>and production of raw materials and that<br>doesn't sound like a sector that we<br>um mindsets so i've spoken about we need<br>to be curious<br>we need learning and growth mindsets we<br>need to be open to changing our minds<br>and respecting the people who do rather<br>than just saying see i told you you were<br>wrong<br>understanding we needed to understand<br>the problems we need to under<br>seek to understand how they how people<br>are impacted<br>others not just ourselves we see this in<br>river catchments<br>where we have the upstream and the<br>we have to recognize that there are<br>different impacts for different people<br>and different groups<br>um and around the different values that<br>we hold<br>and you know there's going to have to be<br>some hard compromises made<br>depoliticizing can we de-politicize our<br>environmental challenges i'm no expert<br>in this but what i do know<br>is business-like certainty and the<br>political swings<br>aren't helpful for long-term investment<br>to making those decisions<br>businesses need the certainty people we<br>need people to really champion and get<br>behind<br>our our river our you know our<br>aspirations for rivers and for the<br>environment<br>we've seen things like predator free do<br>that<br>how do we do that for water you know<br>they've shown that when people actually<br>form a tribe around achieving a really<br>brave goal<br>that they can accelerate change<br>so seeing that in the water space and<br>you know we're starting to hear those<br>catchment stories like anne was talking<br>about<br>with communities really setting those<br>aspirational goals for themselves<br>science we need to follow the science<br>the science needs to be agreed<br>automated and accessible to land<br>stewards<br>i think there's a big gap here between<br>urban and rural<br>with the actual size of the rural area<br>making the cost of the science that's<br>required to do catchment planning<br>and make those investments decisions<br>it's actually really expensive<br>so we need to figure out how to automate<br>that better<br>systems and talked about this but we<br>need to kind of stop being reductionists<br>and siloed<br>we think about nitrogen and sediment and<br>climate and<br>biodiversity separately most of the time<br>and this causes us issues<br>and we also need to acknowledge that<br>there's different scales for addressing<br>these systems<br>there's the farm or the individual land<br>parcel there's the waterway<br>there's the water network and the<br>catchment<br>there's habitats and there's ecosystem<br>scales<br>in the rural space a lot of the focus is<br>on the individual and puzzle<br>and i don't think focusing on just that<br>is going to be enough for the<br>regenerative<br>work that we need to do capability<br>we need to build capability across all<br>players things are moving fast and the<br>change needed in that education and<br>training<br>you know needed for these challenges is<br>actually too slow<br>we talk a lot about collaborating and<br>you know working together but do we all<br>have the skills needed to be able to do<br>that be that<br>you know facilitate that process or even<br>just participate in<br>a collaborative process from our<br>experience then<br>you know on the ground we're really<br>struggling in that space around having<br>the capability to do that work<br>and finally just support like support<br>each other and<br>enable the support that of the change<br>that's required<br>um you know there's a saying that we<br>will go you know faster and further if<br>we go together<br>and that support comes in extension<br>programs and storytelling and<br>data and information sustainable finance<br>and<br>simple and streamlined requirements and<br>processes<br>so that's the end of the shopping list<br>um<br>finally the one of the questions we were<br>asked is if the approach is<br>incremental transition or radical<br>transformation<br>and i'm just going to say it depends<br>and isn't it a combo um i think it<br>depends on the situation<br>we can be quite transformational if<br>there is a crisis<br>in the now like covert or an earthquake<br>i think we absolutely are facing an<br>environmental crisis but it isn't<br>hitting us in that same way<br>as the in the moment shocks of covert<br>and earthquakes<br>so how do you motivate a crisis-like<br>response but without the big ugly<br>shocks maybe it is a combo then<br>maybe we need some transformational<br>thinking supported by<br>realistic and just transitions<br>so i'll leave things there for now and<br>thank you<br>thanks immensely for that we're now<br>going to<br>move on and kevin simon is going to<br>and it's a pleasure to be here i'm a<br>freshwater ecologist and associate<br>professor in the school of environment<br>and so naturally i and all the wonderful<br>students that i work with in my lab<br>we're excited to see this<br>topic so thank you gary for organizing<br>it and the many people who've<br>helped pull it off so i have the<br>distinct pleasure of being able to<br>introduce our next<br>speaker colleen brent colleen comes to<br>us from auckland council<br>she's an environmental scientist who's<br>worked for auckland council for 10 years<br>in several different roles<br>her specialty is in freshwater<br>management in the urban sector<br>in particular stream restoration and<br>watercourse assessments<br>colleen has worked in catchment<br>management team generating catchment<br>management plans<br>and developing projects to mitigate<br>flooding improve water quality and<br>protect waterways<br>during her time working with the<br>operations team she managed the<br>maintenance of five<br>public water courses in central auckland<br>including weed control debris jam<br>removal<br>and riparian planting in her current<br>role<br>colleen's primarily in the urban space<br>and she's working on assessing and<br>remediating<br>stream bank erosion and providing<br>support to the stormwater management<br>plans<br>with technical knowledge of freshwater<br>systems as well as management<br>of the watercourse assessment program so<br>colleen thank you much<br>for coming<br>so many photos guys so many photos<br>security alert<br>thank you it's such a privilege to be<br>here to represent healthy waters and<br>to be alongside all my extinguished<br>panelists so thank you very much<br>um in my presentation i'm just going to<br>give a brief introduction about healthy<br>waters and what we do<br>and we do there's lots of different<br>aspects to us but i'm just going to<br>highlight three<br>aspects um and give an overview on them<br>and then give an<br>example or a little case study about how<br>we do that i'm going to<br>give you a quick summary and then we'll<br>talk about what everyone out there<br>can do to make sure our streams are<br>healthy<br>so when i started the storm water<br>department back<br>10 years ago i was donning my waders and<br>my macro invertebrate net and i was out<br>doing stream surveys<br>my team was primarily hydraulic modelers<br>catchment planners and civil engineers<br>and i was basically the lone<br>ecologist but healthy waters had our<br>stormwater unit has evolved into the<br>healthy waters department<br>and that is because we realize that we<br>need to support a more holistic approach<br>to stormwater<br>we still want to protect our people and<br>our property from flooding<br>but we also realize that we need to<br>preserve the health and value of our<br>waterways and our harbors for future<br>generations<br>so now i am supported and on a team with<br>other scientists environmental engineers<br>and ecologists<br>so we get to collaborate together and<br>learn from each other which is great<br>because we have a big job in front of us<br>this is a map<br>of all the waterways in auckland lots of<br>blue up there<br>we are blessed to have 474<br>rivers and streams throughout our region<br>that's over 16<br>000 kilometers of streams that flow<br>continuously year round<br>just to give some perspective the<br>coastline of new zealand is fifteen<br>thousand kilometers<br>we also have another four thousand five<br>hundred streams that<br>um are um we see for short periods of<br>time<br>and then we have many many others that<br>we see just after a rain event<br>a lot of our streams are small and<br>narrow but we do have some big river<br>systems like the hotel which is 28<br>kilometers long<br>so we have a big job in front of us and<br>managing streams in you know our<br>pristine environment<br>like the white chocolatey rangers or the<br>hanuas is a little bit easier but when<br>we have the demands<br>like we do in auckland with growth it's<br>a different story<br>right now there's 1.6 million people<br>living in auckland<br>and the next 30 years is supposed to go<br>up to<br>2.4 million and as aucklanders we really<br>value<br>you know our our water and our<br>environment<br>so we really need to take the time and<br>energy to protect them<br>and so that's what we want to do in a<br>few ways and of course<br>the way we have to do this is we have to<br>know<br>our streams and catchments and we<br>realize that all of our streams and all<br>of our catchments there's different<br>there's no one-size-fits-all solution<br>that's going to solve all our problems<br>up here on the slide above me it's very<br>busy because we've got a lot going on<br>it shows what healthy waters and the<br>rest of council<br>has developed we have numerous tools and<br>models and databases<br>to help us understand our waterways<br>across the region and<br>and also our attachments so we can<br>better inform our water course<br>management strategies analyzing all this<br>information<br>across all these platforms we can<br>determine well-informed mitigation<br>options<br>and appropriate and management approach<br>so we hopefully won't cause any more<br>damage in the future so one of these<br>which is near and dear to my heart our<br>databases<br>are the water course assessments so<br>these<br>surveys and reports provide baseline<br>information on the existing<br>condition of our water courses so in<br>the past uh um 15 years we have surveyed<br>every inch of 2 000 kilometers of stream<br>so as you can see on this map behind me<br>um<br>primarily in the urban area we've looked<br>at we're also expanding to the rural<br>landscape also and also the green fields<br>areas<br>so this gives us a good baseline<br>information but we also use<br>the data and the information we get from<br>here to help with our management<br>choices for these streams and one thing<br>that has become<br>clear through some through these<br>watercourse assessments is where we are<br>experiencing<br>um significant stream bank erosion<br>across the<br>region and so we realized all right well<br>we need to do something more about that<br>so we're<br>in the exciting time we're developing<br>new tools and new models to help us<br>evaluate the best way to manage our<br>stream make erosion<br>across the region we also are conducting<br>some research<br>on root tensile strength of 11 native<br>plant species to help us with that too<br>so as you can see we're still learning<br>so the next is how do we implement all<br>this knowledge and everything we have<br>so here we have some unfortunate photos<br>from<br>which can be sometimes a common scene<br>around auckland<br>and i like how ann said it and she said<br>where where are the plants<br>where are the animals where are the<br>people and<br>i mean we can't blame the people that<br>made these decisions back then because<br>back then the objectives were conveyance<br>and flood management we need to get our<br>water from point a<br>to point b as quickly as possible or<br>let's put in a pipe<br>that way it's really going to manage all<br>the flooding<br>um but yeah where are the people where<br>are the plants where are the animals<br>so instead of having these two<br>objectives which we do agree<br>we are informed for urban streams we<br>still need<br>conveyance and we still need flood<br>management but what else can we do<br>so this is an example of our oakley cree<br>restoration project which started off as<br>you can see in the upper<br>smaller photo which is 1.3 kilometers of<br>concrete line channel and<br>we just we decided that let's let's<br>let's let's look at this in a different<br>way so we've had<br>a cycleway that's been put in we have<br>community spaces for gathering we have<br>artistic expression<br>um we have um areas<br>where there's outdoor classrooms there<br>we have all these native plants<br>and we also have a inspired playground i<br>believe the first of its kind that's<br>based on maori play so we're having<br>multiple objectives throughout here and<br>also a huge<br>focus of this project was looking at<br>wider<br>social and economic values<br>by implying by starting up a stewardship<br>program and also starting a nursery in<br>here where a lot of these plants that<br>are in the ground<br>so this restoration project offered<br>multiple functions and multiple benefits<br>and<br>it didn't have to have just a concrete<br>line channel so we want to take this<br>same approach<br>so next as we know we have all these<br>waterways across<br>auckland so and we know that improving<br>the water quality is not a one-time fix<br>and it requires our unwavering<br>commitment not only from<br>ourselves but also from multiple<br>organizations<br>and auckland communities throughout the<br>region<br>healthy waters is dedicated to working<br>alongside our ewe partners<br>community groups developers and our<br>private<br>private landowners to enhance protect<br>from the outset we are partnering with<br>manifenoa<br>and our watercourse management projects<br>to seek direction<br>to understand their aspirations for the<br>project and also opportunities for<br>integrating their ideas into design<br>in this picture are two of our kaitiyaki<br>from our erosion management program up<br>in the hotel and their<br>involvement is to monitor the progress<br>of our project<br>and also to look at all the outcomes<br>that we want from them<br>we also there are numerous community<br>groups throughout the region that are<br>trying to improve their local waterways<br>and we have a dedicated team in healthy<br>waters to support<br>and engage with these groups up here on<br>the picture we have one of our y care<br>groups that is monitoring the water<br>quality at this little<br>reach of stream and just doing their bit<br>to look after it<br>we are also providing guidance for our<br>developers<br>on how to use water sensitive design<br>with a specific focus on<br>storm water and fresh water management<br>and up here on this<br>picture we see one of our bio<br>infiltration devices<br>while auckland council and eoe do manage<br>streams across the region a large<br>portion of that 16 000<br>kilometer of streams are on private<br>properties<br>and we need our private property owners<br>to look after them<br>one way the healthy waters is supporting<br>this is through the waterway protection<br>fund<br>and this is uh or this was created to<br>encourage our rural land owners<br>to fence their stream for stock<br>exclusion and to plant<br>over the course of this fund we have<br>restored over 50 kilometers of stream<br>by fencing which is uh equates to almost<br>60 hectares of riparian habitat that's<br>been restored<br>so in this picture here we have our<br>before<br>shot of a stream that is in size and<br>having some erosion<br>issues and the recipients of the<br>waterway protection fund said<br>this doing this with just plants is not<br>going to solve the issue<br>so instead the banks are battered back<br>to a gentle gradient and then planted<br>with over 12 000 trees<br>protecting over 300 430 square meters of<br>riparian habitat<br>so not only is the stream corridor<br>protected<br>you know and improving the aquatic um<br>and the riparian vegetation but also we<br>have landowners<br>that are engaged with maintaining and<br>so just to summary what have we what<br>have we done here<br>a healthy stream to us is one that's<br>resilient<br>and it has enduring mitigation solutions<br>and practices<br>and we determine those by using all of<br>our models and our data and our<br>knowledge and our information<br>to put forward robust management<br>strategies for the water courses<br>we also for a stream a stream is<br>healthy a healthy stream is more than<br>just its physical attributes<br>a water course can deliver a range of<br>outcomes<br>environmental social economic and<br>cultural<br>and a healthy stream is looked after not<br>only by council and ewe<br>but aucklanders all take a role in<br>guardianship<br>so what can all of you do<br>out there near net land and over here<br>in this lecture hall well<br>you can share your knowledge with us um<br>i think you know tris said make science<br>available that's and that's vice versa<br>we want to know we would like to share<br>our knowledge with us all those<br>tools and databases that we have we<br>would love to share that with you all<br>around streams and also if you're doing<br>something interesting with research come<br>talk to us<br>or if you even see an outfall in your<br>stream that's suffering from erosion<br>come talk to us these are things we want<br>to know so let's share our knowledge<br>about<br>streams and catchments next go visit<br>your local stream<br>we have 16 000 kilometers of them there<br>can't be one that's far away from your<br>house<br>so go visit it and do so with an<br>enhanced awareness of not just<br>the ecology but what what's it doing for<br>your<br>the amenity and the spiritual side of it<br>and<br>those kind of things so really take a<br>holistic view of your water course<br>and lastly advocate for your water<br>course go out<br>and join a community group look and see<br>what's going on for stream-sized<br>plantings get out there with a spade<br>and i know if we're all working in this<br>together we can get some good healthy<br>waterways across the auckland region and<br>across ayatora<br>thanks very much um i think we're gonna<br>go<br>now we're going to go brendan's<br>introduction for<br>there is a lot of talk these days about<br>an excess of negativity<br>too much anxiety if only everyone were<br>more upbeat<br>they say we could solve a whole array of<br>social and environmental issues<br>while also having a great time it seems<br>to me though<br>that we are not short of positivity<br>rather we are deluged with snippets of<br>upbeat information<br>companies planting trees to offset<br>carbon emissions<br>birds returning to the streets during<br>lockdown and ministers for the<br>environment who can turn rivers<br>swimmable overnight by revising water<br>sometimes in the face of this relentless<br>positivity not my phrase<br>we need someone to remind us that<br>actually quite a lot of things are<br>pretty crappy and we should probably do<br>something about it<br>our next speaker takes his role as<br>critic and conscience of society<br>very seriously dr mike joy is a senior<br>research fellow in the school of<br>government<br>at victoria university welling of<br>wellington<br>his research and public advocacy<br>regarding the state of our freshwater<br>are well known in this country<br>i knew mike before he was knew of mike<br>before he was famous<br>first becoming aware of his work with<br>russell death on freshwater fish and<br>stream invertebrates<br>during my year of honors study a<br>combination that tends to stick in the<br>mind<br>joy and death developed a series of<br>tools for assessing<br>and understanding the ecological<br>condition of new zealand's waterways<br>since then mike has become a household<br>name known for his tenacious commitment<br>to highlighting the declining state<br>of freshwater in aotearoa he has<br>published in a wide range of venues<br>from aquatic ecology journals to the<br>journal of urgent writing<br>his 2015 book polluted inheritance<br>is described as a call to arms for new<br>zealand's fresh water<br>perhaps rather appropriately it also<br>shares its name<br>with the death metal band from the<br>province of zealand in the netherlands<br>in recent years mike has been the<br>recipient of a number of awards<br>recognizing this work<br>including the royal society of new<br>zealand charles fleming award for<br>protection of the new zealand<br>environment<br>the morgan foundation river voice award<br>the new zealand university's critic and<br>conscience award<br>and he was a semi-finalist for new<br>zealand of the year in 2018<br>not bad for just another scientist golda<br>dr mike joy<br>that's fantastic i don't have to say<br>anything now do i<br>doctor doom i and that's my other name<br>um thanks very much gary for inviting me<br>and um<br>you know to be with these esteemed<br>panelists<br>um to ann as well i<br>hope she's still listening out there<br>somewhere um<br>okay i've just come uh i haven't done my<br>homework<br>i didn't read the questions<br>so i've come totally unprepared i spent<br>a day<br>at waitangi tribunal for a<br>cross-examination yesterday<br>down in wellington and um<br>that was waiting to claim for for<br>nothing cover for the southern<br>part of native and i've also been<br>involved with the<br>y2358 the water ownership claim um<br>as a witness for the murray council as<br>well<br>and really if i could summarise what<br>came<br>out of that work a couple of<br>hundred pages of reports that i wrote<br>with the team there was really the<br>failure to protect freshwater<br>is with the agencies the failure of the<br>ministry for the environment<br>and the failure of the councils and and<br>it's just<br>everywhere we go that's what comes up<br>and it's<br>i i'm not i don't want to um i've got<br>some of my best friends and students<br>work for councils and from ministry for<br>the environment<br>um and i'm not i'm not trying to<br>disparage them they are<br>these organizations are less than the<br>sum of their parts<br>you know there's fantastic people there<br>but somehow what comes out of them<br>is i guess that i'm particularly<br>angry about it because having<br>told my students for the last 20 years<br>that<br>governments don't change we give<br>governments the mandate<br>and then they change um so having spent<br>20 years<br>highlighting the freshwater issues in<br>new zealand and giving this government<br>this coalition government the best<br>mandate possible where 80<br>of new zealanders say that freshwater is<br>their number one issue<br>to work on the science technical<br>advisory group that was instigated by<br>this government<br>and tell this government they'll tell<br>the minister what he needs to do<br>as far as the science side of things to<br>protect fresh waters<br>how gutting it is to have that have them<br>completely fail at that<br>so my faith in democracy has been has<br>been<br>you know sort of damaged or jarred by<br>this process so<br>um you know and and so i i<br>you know there's there's this<br>frustration with<br>the council's failure to do that and<br>it's about<br>priorities i mean i i'm struck being in<br>wellington and working downtown<br>seeing parking wardens everywhere<br>running around doing great job on<br>parking<br>if we had as many people in new zealand<br>monitoring our waterways as we do<br>parking wardens then we wouldn't have a<br>problem<br>the failure is not with the legislation<br>it's the enforcement it's the<br>monitoring enforcement that's not done<br>the rma is<br>really clear that we can't do what we do<br>to rivers but no one's enforcing it<br>that's where the failure is<br>and while i'm in auckland i can have a<br>go orphans where they have<br>a healthy rivers group but my friends<br>who are working in okura<br>and there's a new subdivision going in<br>there and massive amounts of sediment<br>from from what's happening with that<br>housing subdivision going<br>out into the okra bay and destroying the<br>habitat in there<br>and trying to get auckland council to do<br>something about that<br>and just being incredibly frustrated so<br>you can't fix a problem while you still<br>allow it to happen planting up waterways<br>whatever<br>you know and totally agree with<br>everything that trish said in her talk<br>but you can't clean up a river while<br>you're still<br>polluting it we have to go to the cause<br>of these things we have to put the fence<br>at the top of the cliff not the<br>ambulance of the bottom of the cliff<br>and so that's that's where i see our<br>problems and<br>we need to to kind of um to change that<br>way of thinking<br>and i guess i'm particularly frustrated<br>because seeing this<br>instant response of this government to<br>the covert<br>crisis and and so why do epidemiologists<br>get listened to when freshwater<br>ecologists and geomorphologists don't<br>get this into<br>and it's obviously about timeline and<br>immediacy isn't it it's like<br>here's something that's going to hit us<br>right now this is something that we can<br>sort of kick down the road for a bit<br>longer<br>um you know i mean i could and i<br>we have huge issues with freshwater and<br>new zealand and we're<br>not addressing it we're not getting<br>we're not stopping it<br>we haven't decreased the damage that's<br>being done despite all of the talk<br>councils and administrative environment<br>have got really good<br>at pr and comms and<br>covering up and dropping monitoring of<br>sites in the worst places<br>we've just seen that our national river<br>water quality network 77<br>sites that are monitored and have been<br>since 1989<br>only half of them are downstream sites<br>half of those have been dropped since<br>2015.<br>so that's how you make a problem go away<br>you stop measuring it we need to know<br>about that<br>and the other thing in an area that i'm<br>working in quite a bit now where i<br>thought that we would get more happening<br>was that the connection now is really<br>obvious between what we're doing<br>on the land to human health so i don't<br>know if you have been following any of<br>my work around<br>with michael baker from the otago school<br>of medicine and others around colorecal<br>cancer<br>so colorectal cancer is the second<br>biggest killer<br>you know as far as cancers go in the<br>world we have the highest rates of<br>colorectal cancer of any country in the<br>developed world in new zealand<br>the highest rates of colorecal cancer<br>and they're really intensively farmed<br>parts of new zealand where<br>drinking water comes from groundwater<br>we've just<br>been doing some work around that and<br>like<br>we had it's not published yet but a very<br>high proportion of new zealanders<br>we now have the data on nitrate levels<br>and drinking water for four million new<br>zealanders and a very high proportion of<br>new zealanders<br>are receiving drinking water that had<br>levels of nitrate that are higher than<br>the significant increase in the risk of<br>getting<br>a colorectal cancer which by the way is<br>10 times<br>less than the ministry of health's<br>maximum allowable value of the nitrate<br>because this is emerging science<br>we're still working on maximum allowable<br>value from 100 years ago<br>and and and the sciences is so but we<br>haven't changed those limits these are<br>the kind of issues that are coming<br>to us that nitrate is coming from fossil<br>fuels<br>via intensive dairy farming and<br>horticulture in new zealand<br>so there is just negative negative<br>negative uh process there<br>and it's going to harm not just it is<br>harming not just fresh water ecosystems<br>but also human health and this is going<br>to become<br>a much bigger issue in the next few<br>years when people become more aware of<br>that<br>um am i running out of time two minutes<br>okay cool<br>all right so what we need to do<br>in the future is we have to think about<br>and and i think um trish touched on this<br>the multiple<br>impacts in gains okay so if we look<br>across the biggest impact is intensive<br>farming as far as<br>length of rivers in new zealand by a<br>long shot and urban<br>streams and waterways are less than one<br>percent of the waterway length in new<br>zealand so it's that intensive farming<br>that we need to do something about<br>if we take and and it's greenhouse gas<br>working and issues as well as<br>sedimentation as well as nutrients going<br>into waterways that affect lakes rivers<br>groundwater estuaries<br>oceans we have to to have a complete<br>rethink of that<br>and if we silo things and mention this<br>we're always working in silos greenhouse<br>gases<br>nitrate pathogens as if they're all<br>separate things<br>if we do something like the which is the<br>the farming kind of view is let's do<br>something about methane emissions by<br>by say coming up with some um you know<br>treatment that will reduce methane or<br>they can eat seaweed and that will be<br>less meat than that fixes one problem<br>half the number of cows in this country<br>you fix all<br>of those problems and it's not half<br>means half the impact<br>it's way more than half the impact<br>because<br>the exponential rise in impacts means<br>that it's a negative exponential you get<br>rid of half the cows we get way more rid<br>of way more than half the problem<br>so we have to we have to think about<br>that<br>you know when we think about that's<br>radical change yes we need<br>radical change that was what's the last<br>question incremental or radical we're<br>way<br>past incremental it's radical and we're<br>talking about rivers<br>but that is a subset of the kind of<br>change we need to have the bigger issues<br>around climate change and all the<br>multiple impacts that are coming at<br>civilization at the moment<br>if this country can't do it with<br>nitrogen<br>we're not going to be able to do it with<br>carbon with greenhouse gas emissions so<br>so we when we gave this government the<br>mandate they had the opportunity<br>they we've been through all the normal<br>processes and it didn't work so<br>um we need radical change but i also<br>want to mention and remind people that<br>radical change what we're doing now<br>is radical okay we have to realize that<br>how we live now and what we do now what<br>we do on the land<br>is radical what we have to shift to is<br>nowhere near as radical as what we're<br>doing at the moment that will leave it<br>there thank you<br>so thanks very much for that and um i<br>guess it's uh<br>it's not 2020 if you don't have some<br>kind of technical hitch somewhere along<br>the way so unfortunately<br>uh the circumstances with gerard have<br>not been resolved in the last half hour<br>or so um but we<br>uh hopefully it's still available online<br>and if we want to ask questions<br>for jira then we'll get the chance to do<br>so<br>so um i i did ask<br>people for questions and i've had the<br>great fortune<br>in my time here at uh university of<br>auckland to work with some<br>very provocative and challenging<br>individuals who've gone through<br>the classes that we've taught here in<br>the last few years<br>and um one of these fellows is a guy<br>called mark tadaki who now works at the<br>port rock uh institute and um<br>in nelson and uh mike he has a question<br>for you<br>right and and i'm gonna switch things<br>away a little bit from the doctor doom<br>kind of ethos<br>right and it's it's a thorny one right<br>it's not an easy one<br>what kind of democratic institutions<br>do you think we need to be working with<br>if we're going to create healthy rivers<br>yeah that's a good one um<br>i think i know i'm not sure i know what<br>the question is<br>but what it means but obviously my<br>faith in democracy has been severely<br>shaken by<br>what's just happened but i see that the<br>solution<br>is so the problem with the councils and<br>the ministries<br>uh is the politicization of them it's<br>not because<br>the people there don't want to know you<br>know what don't want to do the right<br>thing<br>it's the politicization of those<br>councils so somehow<br>we have to get independence<br>and and and i think there's two<br>possibilities there<br>probably my choice would be<br>i would like to see maori take over<br>managing fresh water in new zealand<br>and and that would be um<br>that would be my my my favorite solution<br>my favorite solution but<br>but the other part of that would be if<br>we can't have that or if we can have<br>partially that we need to have<br>independence<br>so something along the lines of<br>parliamentary commission for the<br>environment is one<br>possibility but we have to we have to<br>take that political<br>aspect away because we can see<br>how politicization just means we never<br>take the tough decisions because it's<br>always trying to please<br>maybe i could suggest that um you know<br>in some ways democracy might not be the<br>answer around levels<br>you know we're taking papa seriously um<br>maybe you know i i think in a community<br>like ours for example<br>we can build the kind of whanau around<br>our the weymouth river<br>we can get people seeing that they've<br>got the sense of kinship<br>with their river but with the plants and<br>the animals and the people<br>that they share it with as well because<br>any of these other<br>institutional framings are going to<br>leave a lot of people out<br>and they're not going to include the<br>plants and the animals it's you're going<br>to go back to a technocratic approach<br>and i think the fuckability's got a lot<br>to teach us<br>and one of it's about how do you build<br>those relationships with each other<br>with the plants you know having thriving<br>forests around rivers<br>with the animals in the rivers but the<br>birds decided and so on<br>um we're doing it through programs with<br>i can see a future for rivers<br>which relies on kinship perhaps<br>lovely response um is gerard available<br>yeah so<br>gerard i think um can uh offer<br>a very timely sort of follow-up comment<br>in relation to these issues so<br>um when we can pass over to him right<br>now<br>thanks gary here um yeah i think it is<br>time<br>and i think i can chip in here because<br>my presentation<br>uh which i was just on the cusp of<br>achieving um<br>this picture is that the family place um<br>how can we bring<br>a total view about what a river is<br>and so um and i will do it this time<br>sharing screen um<br>powerpoint put up and examines them<br>and it talks about our river settlement<br>and the creation of this reality<br>a legal status that's different to any<br>other river in new zealand<br>um the world for that matter so<br>i call it changing heart changing mind<br>because at the end of the day<br>and that's what it's about it actually<br>works on people<br>and it asks us to be more<br>in tune with one another<br>in a<br>communal way and then<br>of course then it will change our mind<br>about what we need to do<br>of course we need to focus in on our<br>rivers directly um<br>mike's right i think so that<br>perhaps democracy is not the best way to<br>actually be treating<br>a river and dealing i'll explain<br>um most of us have kind of built the<br>government before and of course<br>you know things are simple propositions<br>we want to do best by our river and we<br>say can you give us<br>the tool there is an example here a<br>report<br>the crowd says yes yes yes government<br>local government<br>is the same because they're captured by<br>the same engine<br>and the crowning and um<br>you're amazed we've got this for a long<br>time we'll do something really simple we<br>need football purpose solution<br>the ground says great take that content<br>and we'll give it back to you this is<br>what you get<br>i said no we've broadened it out we've<br>actually provided<br>more platforms to actually address it<br>and um so we get more bang for buck<br>really what they've done is<br>complicated very simple proposition that<br>very simple proposition<br>is just to have this of course they will<br>complicate it constantly<br>by delivering this to us and that's of<br>course that critical machine<br>and we're in the throes of a general<br>election<br>and campaigning and of course voting uh<br>in a very short time and of course this<br>is what it will always get you<br>so we need to have community around that<br>rhythm<br>when i was younger a very knowledgeable<br>man very wisely<br>and it was he who said to us in 2008<br>isn't he he said we must go back to the<br>things that we know<br>and instead of arguing uh through the<br>constructs that krampus think that for<br>us<br>uh presents up to argue through our own<br>understanding of what a river is<br>this is where we come back to legal<br>prison who is not the<br>people for foreign arrangement legal<br>person in the vehicle<br>but it's not the actual function the<br>function of course is to uphold<br>coal which is the communal view<br>held by a community for whatever reason<br>and that's our law system that's what<br>we've grown up with and lived with<br>for many many centuries from millennia<br>in this country<br>if we can share that with the community<br>which we have in this project<br>will be in a much better place so<br>is that the river is now a physical<br>admin physical entity<br>so no argument without being able to<br>emote and have a relationship and an<br>emotional<br>spiritual thing for the river whether<br>you are coming from anyone<br>or whether you are people who come<br>afterwards<br>it doesn't matter if we're going to do<br>what's best by the way<br>you need to be able to address it<br>through both its metaphysical as well as<br>physical thought<br>and of course most of the attaching have<br>only gone with the physical<br>the water the banks and the land that<br>drains into it<br>there's the rma dover and you cover it<br>there's a holistic<br>approach in its most basic scene<br>a river is like a person and you can't<br>address the child<br>or person by only talking to their left<br>hand<br>or their writing and of course<br>governments listed up that way as well<br>in a very disjointed way and they will<br>try to strive towards integrated<br>management<br>has never actually happened because the<br>integrated management<br>speaks of trying to get council in<br>bodies and<br>for interest in working together whereas<br>in the older people<br>created an indivisible entity we have a<br>great<br>voice-over view but we've created that<br>law now another visible<br>entity which people are compelled by to<br>actually addressed as a whole<br>so you focus them on the women and<br>whatever it is so those first two<br>polarizers<br>what the river is in its fullest thing<br>is the physical<br>and metaphysical entity and it's an<br>indivisible one<br>then of course you've got to deal with<br>and of course none of them have actually<br>captured<br>the death nature of our relationship<br>with the women<br>so by going back to colorado and<br>establishing that we're actually an<br>axiomatic<br>part of this river we don't need to<br>or section 16 7 8 8 of the result<br>management<br>will tell us we have a relationship with<br>the driver it's a given<br>it takes a metric doesn't need to be<br>programmed<br>it just does and then of course we get<br>across<br>a lot of the uh the best issues that<br>have<br>emptied us and encompassed um through<br>history<br>now the fourth column is that we need to<br>obligate the community into the theatre<br>and so this is where the communal view<br>stbr held not only what opportunity<br>but by the whole community and it's<br>compelled at law now to uphold<br>the obligation to build tupor to the<br>holistic rhythm<br>and not just the parts of the ribbon<br>compartment that's been broken<br>down through um in statute<br>so you see we've actually established a<br>way to actually share the middle view of<br>them and compel people at law to<br>recognize it<br>a legal person just gives that status<br>outlaw<br>uh that you can enhance this too so you<br>can defend it<br>speak for it and uphold it uh in the<br>what i want to go on to just quickly is<br>a view that a um an academic<br>from university of british columbia she<br>wrote a piece in<br>2012 namely elaine<br>and she said the story of the woman<br>named and<br>one of so many narratives olympic times<br>struggle<br>for decolonization of both people in<br>nature<br>because what she's getting to is exactly<br>what i think some of the panels have<br>been talking about tonight<br>is that so often we bring a colonised<br>view to what a river is<br>and of course we colonized as well what<br>that means is that we can<br>accept that the river is a right to be<br>and of course those of us who belong to<br>this<br>river understand the nature of the<br>relationship the correct relationship<br>which is through the sovereignty of the<br>liver itself<br>and so we've all been colonised we've<br>all been sucked into thinking<br>that uh contestability around the use of<br>natural resources is the way<br>priority here that we must control<br>nature<br>of course that's been the wrong approach<br>and so we need to colonize our stalk and<br>so<br>a few pointers we have to get their own<br>direction with it but she saw it from<br>the plant<br>in 2012 well before he signed the<br>demonstration<br>in 2017. now she also said<br>that the principle when she was<br>referring to jupiter<br>clearly demonstrated the relationship<br>between the river and its people<br>but also the interconnectedness of their<br>sovereignty<br>so if we want to program ripple we need<br>to end that problem<br>we need to distribute ourselves back<br>from the encumbrance of government<br>um of the disjoint and desperate nature<br>of government and see the river as a<br>constant<br>so in establishing watercolor the law<br>system for our river<br>what we've established is that in<br>essence<br>everything else can operate around us<br>so david parker produced reforms around<br>freshwater management<br>as the three waters none of it is<br>compliant with double dipole<br>if it didn't come true um<br>but the confidence here and of course in<br>a few weeks time we might have a<br>different makeup to government who knows<br>but of course that's always going to<br>change we need to see our rivers and our<br>communities<br>as the continent and ensure that we have<br>a communal<br>um way of approaching dealing with their<br>rules<br>and i finished on this point um there's<br>a picture of myself<br>and my son on the right via um<br>it's actually permission on geographic<br>and i political pictures<br>and so we took this photographer from<br>national geographically from europe<br>and he wanted to see uh tuna and see you<br>took him down and went to you and of<br>course my son my understanding myself<br>we tried to uphold the values of people<br>through all our practices and our<br>relationship with the river<br>on the left um a picture of a people<br>known as his name is<br>and if we had the fire and a little<br>child that's my grandmother<br>and this picture was taken about 1895<br>somewhere towards the end of the<br>19th century and of course you can see<br>there<br>being lucky you can see and where their<br>library would come<br>came from and of course to continue to<br>uphold the values that they had<br>and i don't think it's a stretch to<br>think that we can go back to israel<br>they look for simple lifestyles they<br>lived on their land<br>and my grandmother's adopted father who<br>wrote off<br>the gentleman standing he was at all my<br>own level of the people<br>and he was a very lended man he didn't<br>put on in years that's the best clothes<br>that he had for their photograph and<br>his diamond that he carried the<br>knowledge that he carried was all about<br>the relationship with nature and you see<br>that he looking<br>in the focus and his relationship with<br>his ex is coming from<br>so no it's not a strict when you look on<br>the right there um<br>the photo i saw with my thumb that we<br>can go back and put these block holes in<br>there<br>so i'll stop here but i do want to make<br>the point<br>and i support all of the discussion<br>tonight and<br>the presentations they're around the<br>biophysical river<br>and water waste and that's important but<br>i think might<br>and are driving back to where we need to<br>be we need to treat<br>that river as a communal focus<br>and ensure that we strip ourselves from<br>the incumbencies of government<br>and see the river what it is an act this<br>community not government<br>yoga<br>um sometimes<br>the ways that we didn't plan things end<br>up better<br>the ways it actually is a perfect place<br>i think for us to finish i think it<br>gives us a remarkable sense of<br>togetherness<br>this this sense of indivisible entities<br>the ways that we relate to river systems<br>that is where my aspiration lies for the<br>future and i think that's what<br>many people that many of the comments<br>heard today reflect upon that issues<br>around<br>kinship technomatic solutions but our<br>relations to<br>river systems um so we could have said<br>that we planned that and i couldn't have<br>hated it but<br>at least that is a wonderful place for<br>us to end up<br>um we are on time um i just wanted to<br>thank um various people that have sort<br>of helped make this happen<br>uh samantha has been amazing as a sort<br>of like the the go-to person and bree<br>from the marketing people at the uni<br>and john and the technical people that<br>from university of auckland have really<br>helped us<br>arrive at this point right where we can<br>wrap this thing up<br>and i'd just like to ask dan just to say<br>a few words of fun farewell before we<br>head over to<br>um<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer
