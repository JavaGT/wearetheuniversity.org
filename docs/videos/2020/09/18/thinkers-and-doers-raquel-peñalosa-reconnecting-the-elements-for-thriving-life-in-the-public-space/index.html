From the traditional design practice that sets its design production in a certain distant and "controlled" process by the designer, to the integration of exploratory approaches such as the living lab approach—which envisions the open space as a laboratory of public life, or social innovation—as an innovation practice to pursue the social needs of the space beyond its sole formal resolution. It is also an exploration of the practice that departs from the "expert" posture to going out into the field to understand people's experiences and allow the voice of the collective intelligence to be an active actor in a co-creation process. <br><br>The presentation explores how emerging public space is at the core of public life when using open/ derelict spaces, such as "urban vacant lots", as territories of "new possibles", as spaces of temporality that have meaning allowing for citizen participation. It will share both project interventions, the hard design, as well as the design process, soft design, to explore what makes people happy, or rather what spaces create a connection for people to first use it, then take ownership, and ultimately transform it as need it or experience it.<br><br>A practicing Landscape Architect for more than 30 years, Raquel Peñalosa works at the confluence of Landscape Architecture, Urban Participatory Design, Active Citizenship and Social Innovation. She is currently practicing participatory design and integrating collaborative processes to bring into the design conversation the active citizenship practice for more thriving and human oriented cities. Through her practice, she has developed public space projects and events, in Canada, California and France. She has acquired a distinctive practice and a fine sense of Landscape and its diversity of expressions. <br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students, and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's a great pleasure<br>to welcome you to our lecture series uh<br>wherever you are based in new zealand or<br>from all over the world<br>um and it's my pleasure as well to<br>introduce you to<br>raquel penalosa as part of our thinkers<br>and doers<br>lecture series for those that don't know<br>me my name is brenda marquez<br>and i'm the program director for<br>landscape architecture and<br>tearing waka university of wellington<br>if it's the first time you are attending<br>our election series<br>it aims at bringing together<br>practitioners<br>scholars students and a wider community<br>of landscape architects<br>and affiliated build environment<br>disciplines to basically share ideas<br>on latest innovations and all the<br>challenges that we are currently facing<br>together<br>um so this is an initiative between the<br>new zealand<br>institute of landscape architects our<br>wellington branch<br>and the program at victoria university<br>it's my great pleasure to introduce you<br>to our 10th<br>speaker raquel penalozza apart from<br>being a good friend<br>and knowing each other for many years<br>she is a practicing landscape architect<br>for more than 30 years<br>and her work explores the synergies<br>between landscape architecture<br>urban participatory design active<br>citizenship and<br>social innovation she is currently<br>practicing<br>participatory design and integrating<br>collaborative processes<br>uh to bring into the design conversation<br>the active citizenship apprentice for<br>more<br>thriving and human oriented cities<br>through her practice she has developed<br>public space projects<br>and events in canada california and<br>france<br>raquel was also the 8th america's<br>region president from 2014 2018<br>and she led a very important document<br>called the americas<br>landscape charter and she was also the<br>president for the canadian urban ecology<br>center in 2014.<br>currently she is the president in<br>leading the<br>community an open innovation<br>organization<br>who is leading the coming to of the fab<br>city summit<br>to montreal this year in 2020 for those<br>that don't<br>know if you won yeah i'm 21 sorry<br>no no no because that was what's<br>supposed to be this year yeah oh yeah<br>yeah it makes sense the fab city<br>is a movement to transition cities<br>in 2054 into greater autonomy<br>of a model of resilience and local<br>production<br>which places the city and its citizens<br>in the middle of creation distribution<br>and reuse of the large majority of what<br>they consume and produce<br>so this lecture will be titled<br>reconnecting<br>with the elements for a more thriving<br>life in a public space<br>and will look at the practice of<br>designing public space from experiential<br>perspective from the traditional design<br>practice that sets<br>its design production in a certain<br>distance and controlled process<br>by the designer to the integration of<br>exploratory approaches<br>such as the leaving a lab approach to<br>envision the open space as the<br>laboratory<br>of public life or social innovation as<br>an<br>innovation practice to pursue the social<br>needs of the space beyond<br>its sole formal resolution recalls<br>presentation<br>will be showing us how emerging public<br>spaces are at the core of the public<br>life<br>when using open related spaces such as<br>urban vacant lots as territories of new<br>possibilities<br>and spaces of temporality that have<br>meaning<br>allowing for citizen participation<br>so raquel uh will very soon be sharing<br>her screen with us uh so please keep<br>this window open so you can actually see<br>her slides and i was also recommend you<br>to keep<br>yourself muted throughout the talk and<br>don't forget that at the end there will<br>be<br>opportunity to post questions either<br>verbally or you can actually write them<br>in a chat box<br>without further ado please welcome uh<br>raquel all the way from montreal canada<br>thank you bruno i'm very happy to be<br>here and<br>um yes i will go in uh right now and<br>put my presentation on um<br>oh okay so i have to do the sharing<br>sorry<br>yeah yeah i thought i don't see you<br>anymore<br>so um since um<br>i'm going to share something that i<br>really have not<br>done in this manner with this community<br>um as far which is the professional<br>community<br>so i wanted to experiment something that<br>is<br>uh i know a lot of you probably know<br>storytelling<br>uh and as a practice of how i'm going to<br>uh present the the to do this<br>presentation<br>as a practice of of really um being very<br>um<br>uh in tune to a process that i have been<br>going through in the last<br>i would say 10 years or so um<br>and so as i mentioned departing from the<br>traditional practice<br>uh and exploring other practices and and<br>seeing<br>how how they connect and how they become<br>one because this is really<br>difficult to be always in in two worlds<br>so uh this is what i'm exploring and<br>this is the<br>the in between space that uh or the echo<br>tone that we can color or the<br>the between the cracks where<br>something new can happen so the way i'm<br>going to share this<br>is both true um projects that are<br>done in a traditional manner and<br>questions that come out from this<br>project and what makes it um<br>triggers what um might have been<br>um a shift to to to to<br>to explore other ways of of dealing with<br>this territory which is this public<br>space and how<br>as designers we can also learn and<br>and and embrace other ways of doing this<br>and we all<br>i think uh the posture that i would like<br>to<br>throw here uh for all of us that we are<br>all citizens sometimes we talk these<br>citizens but we are also citizens so how<br>do we embrace<br>our contribution to the environment of<br>of public life<br>um being directly connected to it and<br>being part of<br>and not as a producer of the space so<br>the notion of reconnecting uh with so<br>it's reconnecting the elements and<br>reconnecting with<br>the elements so that's the the opening<br>so<br>uh yeah i'm in montreal um so i'm<br>connecting through the virtual space<br>auckland and and montreal i'm uh<br>originally from bogota colombia this is<br>where<br>my sister and brother are from now i'm<br>so i'm i'm i'm<br>i'm still in this uh american continent<br>but<br>this is something that interesting just<br>to to say how<br>how when you move from a different place<br>into a new place what are the elements<br>what what are you searching for and i<br>think this is a<br>search for belonging and identity so how<br>this<br>is this comes into the question in on on<br>public space which is really<br>so just for all of us to set on the same<br>space<br>um this is montreal which is an island<br>in the saint lawrence river<br>uh bruno was here in 2017 when the world<br>design summit<br>um and this is our our world<br>of being surrounded by water and having<br>what we call the mountain on the<br>backdrop and so this duality i've always<br>been<br>from from uh the bottom looking at the<br>mountain being on the water and from the<br>mountain<br>um looking into the city<br>so this is so which is a pretty flat<br>level<br>uh because we are on the champlain um<br>um uh the champlain valley<br>which is uh it was covered in the<br>quaternary by so<br>very uh this is why uh the indigenous uh<br>movements came<br>uh montreal was one moment of happening<br>and settlement for the the indigenous<br>uh communities here so this is montreal<br>from our mountain and<br>so montreal is a city of street activity<br>as you can see uh the mountain is again<br>in the backdrop<br>um montreal is also a city where<br>things happen there is a it's a small<br>scale cities a scale where where we can<br>have the<br>the ability to meet the other montreal's<br>city of neighborhoods but also<br>is a city of vacant lots<br>and sorry for the color of this this<br>photo but this<br>uh this image this this is amazing<br>i realized that anything be before 2000<br>was in paper which is not a slide so<br>this<br>is what i'm going to tell you about<br>because we we talk about the<br>vacant lots also has been the territory<br>where um<br>anything can happen we can explore uh<br>how we live and or we<br>we create uh public spaces<br>for uh a thriving life in the city<br>so a lot of vacant lots uh this is back<br>in the 1990s<br>uh end of 1990s um i was working for the<br>city<br>when i came back to montreal and i was<br>working for the city<br>um the whole city was<br>i mean it was it was it was just uh in a<br>very<br>it was a it was a economical oppression<br>so a lot of<br>vacant lots and difficulties<br>so this is a space um where<br>since i was working for the city and<br>being involved as the<br>landscape architect um uh responsible<br>for<br>um landscape landscape architecture in<br>the in the in the around this month<br>the course the core uh on this from all<br>montreal and the core<br>of the center of the city i was involved<br>on the<br>uh regenerating uh<br>or thinking about open spaces and<br>breaking lots and so this is one project<br>so the reason why i'm bringing this here<br>is<br>is how the use how vacant lots<br>uh how do we work with them from the<br>traditional perspective of the landscape<br>architecture profession so this is<br>um this is the metro the chandeliers<br>metro which is at the at the connection<br>between the new<br>the the modern city and all montreal<br>and this is the state of the the space<br>um and as the entrance to<br>the heritage city and and all it was<br>really<br>uh not very attractive and it was more<br>uh functional space for<br>uh more uh parking and<br>for the for the metro employees so this<br>is a beautiful building uh with<br>uh work from marcel ferran<br>and so it was very inspiring for me so<br>this is really really derelict space i<br>mean this is where in the middle of the<br>of the<br>of the tourist city at the same time so<br>the idea was to uh do<br>and it was a temporary intervention<br>because the lot was not<br>a public space lot but it was a to be<br>built this is how<br>most of the of the metro projects are<br>they did the metro uh outcome and then<br>it was going to be uh uh development<br>afterwards but this<br>was left like this because of the<br>economical depression so<br>i came in and this is the project it's a<br>project that meant to connect<br>uh the different features of the of the<br>of the<br>of the of the old montreal and the new<br>and the new city<br>but it was also an exploration it was<br>the first time perennials were using<br>exploration on on the experience<br>on just promenading you know just<br>walking through the space um<br>and and in a very simple manner you know<br>traditionally here<br>but with uh so this this was a<br>transformation of<br>of this vacant lot that had a a<br>a very interesting impact on on people<br>on on the experience of going through<br>the space<br>so uh since it was a temporary project<br>um so here's more of the planting<br>playing with the colors and you know<br>very<br>uh straightforward but powerful project<br>um not geared to have people sitting in<br>it they didn't want it but<br>people started using it and you know<br>very very uh uh so he created an<br>interesting impact that again<br>is a vacant lot transform as we do you<br>know we design<br>we program and then we it was<br>beautiful this is fall again the the<br>so then from that vacant lot we're going<br>to<br>vacant lots in san catherine street<br>which is the main<br>uh commercial street in montreal very<br>patrimonial and<br>and again this is the 1990s uh<br>this uh signage that you see here is it<br>was a uh<br>to be built this is 1995<br>and the the building that was supposed<br>to be there was 1990<br>you know opened in 1992 and<br>nothing was happening we're here in the<br>middle of concordia university<br>main trooper i mean this is this is a<br>very vital<br>street in in montreal and um and and san<br>catherine street so it had<br>at least 20 25 bacon lots like this one<br>so<br>uh since since all these uh vacant lots<br>were<br>um to be um<br>to become uh building uh spaces<br>as they became after um<br>so what do we do what was the temporary<br>so the notion of temporality coming into<br>into<br>the the the resolution or at least a<br>temporary<br>uh environment of the the very depressed<br>uh uh location that we had here and<br>so there was one empty lot here on the<br>back there was another one and another<br>corner<br>was another one and these are all<br>theater beautiful<br>all theater that disappear afterwards<br>so um yeah this is this is very uh<br>a situation that is typical of all<br>this is interesting this is the that<br>what happens when you leave a space like<br>this<br>uh untouched and so<br>a lot of native or or<br>spontaneous vegetation that we will call<br>in certain ways<br>like not very novel you know not not the<br>ones that we would like to use but it's<br>i think it's it's it has a meaning you<br>know<br>and so here this is uh another view<br>not the other lot so what happened<br>so we intervened in a very uh<br>it was it was interesting because we<br>were able to maintain to<br>to deal and see and say hey we have to<br>maintain this vegetation<br>so it was because it was a deep hole<br>so it was protected a lot of sidewalks<br>were built through<br>and so it created this little pocket<br>of enlargements from the street so<br>it really became so another kind of like<br>a transition less<br>um formal and less impossible<br>on the side so working with what<br>whatever was there than the other one<br>so but this this was the site so i'm<br>gonna show you something that is<br>part of this notion of storytelling<br>something that that strikes you and says<br>hey what's going on here so this this<br>was the scene from the street<br>and then vegetation we could see it<br>happening we know it was going inside<br>i mean there was a not a hole happening<br>inside<br>this is in the middle of the city this<br>group of i mean we can say whatever we<br>want to say with this but<br>this is amazing these people created<br>their own<br>salon you know the living room<br>i i went into the space through a little<br>entrance<br>and i just i just caught this and i<br>thought<br>ah my god we walk outside<br>and we feel that this is nothing is<br>happening that there is no life here and<br>then this is<br>and then these people which are the<br>street people<br>are having their own world and there was<br>fire<br>peak in there and i mean they didn't<br>want me to be there so i had to<br>run outside but i think this is a new<br>possible<br>and this image stayed with me uh for the<br>longest time<br>so i think this is a breakup moment this<br>is something happened there something<br>made me think that what's out there you<br>know how do we<br>these people have a knowledge of the<br>space that we<br>are not seeing because we're looking at<br>it from the outside<br>and from the perspective of it should be<br>something else<br>so moving from that um<br>i really not that this image that i move<br>directly right after that but at the end<br>of the 2000s<br>i i there's something happening in my<br>brain and and also i just wanted to add<br>and i'm looking at time bruno um that um<br>i had done research uh in bogota<br>colombia uh 1990s there was an amazing<br>uh citizen movement led by antanas mokus<br>transforming the city i mean where did<br>we we're dealing with the eight million<br>people city<br>real problems montreal has no problems<br>they connecting uh uh referring to that<br>and not to go through the whole process<br>that probably a lot of you know about it<br>but i think what it was<br>interesting was that he developed not<br>this is what i'm talking about soft<br>design<br>it was not only uh creating a<br>better public space but he created a<br>culture a citizen culture<br>that was called that culture<br>so citizen culture was to say we are<br>citizens of the city so all of us<br>are citizens of the city we have a<br>direct<br>uh who have rights but also we have<br>responsibilities so creating a<br>relationship<br>so i said so i was i was doing a<br>research on public space and<br>so it says public developing the public<br>identity so what antennas marcus<br>was able to do in bogota was to connect<br>territory<br>and the people and this is when you<br>develop identity so what are the<br>processes that allow us to do this<br>so i started moving into completely<br>outside of<br>our world of the practice the<br>traditional practice moving into the<br>social innovation practice<br>and seeing what was going on and how<br>what was<br>um how can i learn to<br>to see and and have new perspectives and<br>new approaches to<br>allow me to be more human and more<br>connected<br>so this is art of hosting which is uh<br>you can you can find it is an approach<br>that brings into the conversation uh<br>um a more humane uh uh<br>center it's not only people-centered but<br>human-centered you talk from your heart<br>so there are four pillars that are based<br>on the base of this<br>approach that are you host yourself so<br>you're present<br>uh you host the others so you are<br>actively listen to the other<br>so this is a little bit of what we're<br>doing here<br>uh you participate so you are our<br>present you know you're you're you're<br>actively actively participating<br>contributing and listening and then you<br>you co-create so these are the<br>conditions<br>um that you can you can develop to to<br>really have<br>powerful and and and and sense making<br>um uh situations so<br>just you know just talking about what<br>was it what are the relationships what<br>are the so<br>in the processes a lot of workshops that<br>we did that uh<br>things started to to to<br>to appear you know what to say space how<br>how to create the safe space where we<br>can all have a voice<br>and not just having the voice of the<br>expert<br>designers but just you know there is a<br>collective intelligence<br>out there that we have to learn to to<br>to to to appreciate and because there is<br>a knowledge on<br>the place that we probably don't have<br>if we just stay distant with our<br>processes all the time<br>so these are all based on the process of<br>co-creation but uh<br>it was interesting to see how all these<br>became kind of like<br>all these concepts and understanding and<br>i think what the most important thing is<br>to practice<br>to be a practitioner so i became a<br>practitioner and i'm a<br>an advantage so i'm a learning so what<br>i'm doing right now<br>is i'm and the process also learning and<br>conveying to you<br>um what moved me to to to bring into<br>this<br>uh way of doing so from this<br>first event in 2012 emerged this project<br>that i had<br>is just to say come to the table and<br>let's have a conversation<br>i'll do a little bit so there was a um<br>a newly designed space in the city<br>and my neighborhood and again by the<br>metro and and so<br>you know done as we do all the time<br>really well done<br>very excellent so i was wondering what<br>else can be done you know what what's<br>the other how do we<br>spark this as so people can<br>empower themselves and you know<br>appropriate themselves in ownership<br>take ownership of the space so the event<br>was um so what makes people think about<br>so that's them just doing a capture of a<br>video that we did<br>there um how public space decision<br>making happens in the city so<br>one of the core um um questions<br>for the project was is it was a citizen<br>initiative born from a dream of giving<br>voice to the citizen<br>as part of the municipal elections in<br>montreal<br>we're having another time and with the<br>goal of collectively creating a citizen<br>manifesto<br>inspired by kitchen table conversations<br>at a table situate<br>was done in collaboration with uh two<br>other groups<br>and so we had what what happened is that<br>we had<br>we set ourselves to have conversations<br>with the people<br>um so we were sitting conversations<br>so it says you know in this place i<br>dream of<br>and so we had um called a lunch uh<br>hanging you know the for for your<br>clothes<br>for hanging like your clothes and people<br>were putting their their dreams you know<br>we have this clothing<br>and you know i dream of my children and<br>my family<br>to have a community garden um<br>and so it was the first collection and<br>first contact<br>uh um for me to to to see how how<br>wonderful it was when you give the the<br>the<br>the citizens when we give ourselves the<br>opportunity to to<br>to um to say what we're dreaming of and<br>where we are<br>and dreams become uh uh reality and how<br>we<br>do we tackle that so this is a project<br>um<br>la danza reference which is a<br>participatory process to transform a<br>local street<br>so this is uh one project where we kind<br>of like<br>we use the the the uh<br>social innovation and the living lab<br>also<br>approaches to um really now come<br>into uh actual um public space<br>uh project transformation so we we were<br>um<br>i was with the group we were we we uh we<br>were invited by the mayor of this<br>uh uh borough uh to<br>do a participatory process in order to<br>have the voice of the citizens in order<br>to<br>do because the whole street was going to<br>be renovated and we are we're in a<br>in a diverse neighborhood with<br>newcomers and the the older generation<br>and uh very you know as you can see um<br>street you know we can say that this is<br>right you know there's people<br>but there were things happening so uh<br>what i'm going to do with this one is<br>just a little bit of you know how the<br>space is<br>and so we the the process just just<br>quickly<br>the first um<br>it was interesting i would mention that<br>the first thing was that the mayor of<br>this borrower<br>was willing to go into a process like<br>this<br>you know politicians always are a little<br>bit fearful of<br>opening too much and so i think this is<br>a first<br>step that we'll see it in another<br>project so<br>the first we we went out to the street<br>so we set ourselves on the street uh<br>and uh talking<br>there were questions and so we were<br>asked the people you know what<br>what what's and and the questions were<br>geared to<br>to see what what was the relationship<br>with the streets you know what was for<br>them<br>that was important for them on the<br>street what was<br>uh uh memories from the street so this<br>was done<br>uh on the two-day um process that we sat<br>on the street um and then<br>the second part was uh to do workshops<br>so we<br>the way this workshop worked we had our<br>first session of workshop<br>uh i'll just do it quickly and then we<br>we we see what comes out of this<br>workshop and we do a second one<br>so um the way that and also<br>how do you bring a citizen you know<br>we're so used to uh<br>with our language and the way we do<br>things and then how we amalgamate you<br>know<br>because of our uh the way we we<br>you know we we understand everything at<br>the same time but when you talk to<br>people<br>you have to change your language and you<br>have to change what's a street you know<br>what's a sidewalk what's the crossing<br>what's a landscape what's so<br>bring down to with a in a level of<br>communication<br>so you know this where paper uh<br>the grays the street the uh<br>purple is the sidewalk and so how you<br>play with it so<br>it was just you know how how you have to<br>shift also<br>when we are communicating and visit uh<br>our uh way of of doing<br>um this is how<br>they were explaining after and then<br>making sense so after we collected all<br>this information and see what the people<br>would say<br>we go back and then we try to uh<br>um to make sense to see what was<br>important to them what's the<br>what what's their understanding of<br>public space<br>and what are the needs you know what's<br>what are what is the knowledge that<br>comes from the street what happens on<br>the true what's the<br>what's the the the story that we don't<br>know because we<br>don't live there but they live here so<br>the diversity of people that come into<br>this<br>meetings are important so after making<br>sense<br>we went back and started drawing<br>but drawing in a manner that was kind of<br>like<br>you know whimsical uh what's the<br>crossing you know what's that and so<br>after we did this this went into<br>these boards that serve as the<br>communication<br>uh on on on the meeting and also uh<br>i forgot to mention that all this was<br>happening also<br>on the web so even the questions from<br>the first phase were on the web so<br>people could<br>answer if they were not able to come and<br>all these uh these panels were also put<br>on some<br>uh uh storefronts so people could come<br>in and there was some<br>somebody uh facilitating and bringing so<br>the entrances what are the entrances so<br>the street the two<br>anchors from the street what are what do<br>they look like what are they<br>you know this is so the drawing that<br>um i was the one who did these grinds<br>the drawings that came back<br>had to done in a very simple manner had<br>to be done<br>in uh and um uh<br>so we did the entrances we did the the<br>crossings<br>each one each element had to be<br>separated the<br>the the sidewalks uh circulation<br>uh so was there because there was an<br>issue of do we<br>bring a bicycle pad here how do we do it<br>there was a lot of issues with<br>uh some of the crossings here that were<br>very complicated you know they had to<br>put somebody to help<br>uh because there was always the children<br>had to cross so how do we solve that<br>so i think it was a quite interesting<br>so this is the plan so i mean when we<br>come out<br>and then there is a plan like this in a<br>transitional manner uh you know this is<br>what we do all the time but i think this<br>plan<br>in a certain way reflected uh uh in a<br>certain very certain way<br>what people wanted so we thought uh and<br>so<br>after this process this was brought in<br>we were not the ones who who did the<br>project<br>and i didn't bring uh photos of at the<br>end but but it really uh uh is a it's a<br>very um<br>i think it it did help uh to to<br>understand where were the issues for the<br>for the citizens and the things that<br>they wanted to have<br>so it's a very little uh a lovely uh<br>street now<br>and um we hope you can<br>uh we can have more of these processes<br>so now i'm talking about another project<br>with now we're going back to vacant lots<br>this is a<br>shonde posible uh uh possibilities<br>um uh field of possibilities<br>so it's a citizen-driven project this is<br>a now in a<br>more um residential neighborhood<br>that's where you live in the plateau and<br>this is a<br>huge empty lot uh you can't have a full<br>structure place<br>and then just wait for people to test to<br>it i think this is a<br>very interesting notion so this is a uh<br>as we call it we will call it a<br>brownfield um<br>creating public space is a continuous<br>and dynamic process<br>then now our co-creation models are<br>viable for design but also tool for<br>implementation and continuity and site<br>change<br>through the history of each community<br>this is a very engaged<br>citizen community um and what happened<br>here<br>is a site that was<br>in a industrial area this is the whole<br>site<br>we were standing right by here and this<br>is uh a first<br>what triggered the project was an<br>integration by an artist<br>it's a piece<br>is a project that that is i think it's<br>been done<br>throughout the world so this is the site<br>this is a a<br>uh uh brownfield leftover from you know<br>you have the railroad here and then this<br>is the industrial buildings and now<br>being transformed also this is there is<br>there is a lot of uh clothing<br>manufacturing here<br>so the artist comes in and starts doing<br>this<br>and so then it triggers the interest by<br>the citizens<br>and as you can see they're very built<br>around so<br>what is interesting in this project is<br>that it then you become<br>a a project that is brought by these<br>citizens<br>and uh it's good to say that uh you know<br>what is this<br>project what is happening here um<br>then there is the whole process this is<br>all all but it's<br>all uh citizen driven uh and what is<br>interesting in this project is that<br>um the new the the the we have<br>at this moment in montreal and in this<br>neighborhood uh progressive uh<br>politicians<br>so this is a project this is uh the<br>biologists explaining what was happening<br>and the whole uh how uh<br>the whole plan as we can see it here<br>they were doing identifying and then in<br>order<br>to uh continue uh the the ecological<br>process<br>of the sites because because this um<br>there was a<br>joint um um<br>process with the the the mayor's<br>office and uh and they declared this<br>space<br>public natural public park<br>it was a natural uh public park and so<br>in order to uh uh recognize the the<br>the value of the biodiversity in this<br>area and<br>and everything the ecological corridors<br>and the citizen-driven evidently it is a<br>contaminated project<br>uh site so the whole piece here that<br>has been uh decontaminated at this<br>moment<br>um and then there is you know the<br>intervene<br>of of uh the development or of of a<br>design project that is<br>all uh uh based on as we can see<br>so it is uh uh well this year has been<br>much more difficult but is a place where<br>anything can happen they have a<br>a season of<br>programming and um so it's been<br>it remains a very powerful and very um<br>uh citizen driven uh project<br>well now um let me just jump back to a<br>project that<br>i i am developing right now is with the<br>idea<br>of uh less co2 by design so that was<br>kind of like trying myself<br>again to using uh social innovation<br>processes<br>to uh bring it back to us how do we do<br>design<br>uh and in time of climate change and so<br>this project<br>it was a project that i call on friends<br>and said you know<br>my question was um<br>how do we bring um<br>connect uh climate change<br>and the citizens because um uh in your<br>local environment<br>the question was that you know we talk<br>about climate change and it remains a<br>high<br>level i mean and the citizens we said<br>you know what can we do in my<br>environment what can<br>can i change things so that was that was<br>a question<br>so we can gain power and take action and<br>so this is<br>citizen scientist project and the idea<br>was to to tackle<br>uh pollution has been the first element<br>for this project<br>to tackle pollution uh and um<br>uh as as as uh as a way of understanding<br>what's you know how i don't know i yeah<br>it smells bad or<br>you know i don't i don't know how to<br>deal with it so<br>we the the process is that um um<br>you walk the there's there's a walk in<br>your neighborhood and you use your body<br>as your primary sensor<br>for the primary sensor to to see what's<br>uh uh<br>you know what's uh disrupting the<br>natural systems<br>uh what's smelling what you know is<br>there a lot of noise<br>car circulation and<br>at the heart you know be connected to<br>your own territory and be engaged in it<br>so at this moment uh<br>if we become more sensitive to our<br>environment again<br>we build measurement tools to quantify<br>our senses and then we can collect and<br>complete this data<br>and then analyze the results and then<br>bring them back to the politicians and<br>said yes you know this<br>is proven that in my neighborhood there<br>is pollution because of this and this<br>and that<br>and so see it is a citizen science<br>project is a project that is supported<br>by<br>by a community of scientists there is a<br>methodology<br>so it empowers the citizens to have a<br>clear voice and<br>acknowledge that yes it is um<br>it is uh it is polluted and it is<br>causing me<br>problems health problems so um<br>the uh sensor to do this is the<br>project there is one part which was the<br>the the walks and then the canary<br>the sensor to detect uh air pollution uh<br>became the project of one of our members<br>annie<br>that works with community and and she<br>took it<br>as a development of the of the sensor in<br>the fablab<br>you know is the fablab uh um<br>also and i saw why canary because<br>canaries<br>were used on the mines to detect the<br>quality of air<br>so they um they<br>uh they were the first if they were<br>nothing anymore that means the air was<br>really bad so that's why we<br>call the project energy and canary is a<br>prototype<br>of a sensor um<br>and what he wanted to do was to make a<br>sensor that was<br>more um more accessible to the children<br>more accessible to the everyday citizen<br>so they could use it<br>and the idea was that um so this is what<br>what<br>happened uh and he developed<br>the the sensor<br>and the forum of a canary<br>and uh the idea was to do<br>uh uh prototype uh the walks with the<br>citizens at the fabla<br>of the fab city uh event that was to<br>happen<br>in montreal in july last this year but<br>not no<br>it did not happen but uh the event<br>happened online uh fabrics live<br>so the 31st of of july we<br>did a prototyping of the the whole uh<br>uh process so there was a group uh<br>making the censors and then there was<br>another group we were having<br>a conversation about citizen<br>participation<br>and the acknowledgement of of the<br>citizen science uh<br>process that could give the the citizen<br>the ability to<br>uh have a uh um scientific knowledge<br>of the quality of the air we we're going<br>to you know we're going to talk about<br>the water<br>all the different elements that can be<br>involved<br>in the understanding of the impact of<br>climate change but we started with this<br>one<br>so this is this is the online process we<br>are all online<br>and then here's we're having the the<br>conversation<br>in community which is the key<br>the kitchen that is the conversation<br>piece and so we're doing this online<br>um while they are fabricating the the<br>sensors<br>outside<br>and then we went out to prototype so we<br>went out<br>to the street with the sensors and to<br>see<br>uh how we were going how how they were<br>working<br>so how to be connected from local to<br>global i'm almost finishing<br>um climate change is a global issue but<br>we need to solve it locally but we need<br>to be connected<br>so this is what is interesting on on<br>being on the<br>citizen sign project because it allows<br>to to<br>you know the local data to be uh sent<br>out<br>into this into the into the web and so<br>this opens<br>uh to me to talk about the next project<br>which is the fab city<br>a fab city is a movement that emerges<br>from<br>um from the fab lab communities which is<br>uh fabricating that we're able to<br>fabricate almost anything we<br>we can we need to but also a flaps<br>fab lab is a is a it's a third year it's<br>a it's a it's a<br>it's again another uh space for<br>empowering the<br>citizen to use technology uh as<br>us<br>as a way of fabricating everything we<br>need to but also<br>creating the collective intelligence<br>around uh uh<br>bringing the citizens with you know<br>there is a lot of people<br>uh experts that come to the fab labs<br>because they like it and then they<br>there is an exchange so there is a<br>community that that comes to that so fab<br>city<br>is uh uh 2054<br>um uh imagining that a city that can uh<br>produce and uh is a shift<br>on on how we we can live in the city so<br>what i wanted to mention here was that<br>we<br>in order to create the event<br>and there is going to be during the<br>event there is going to be a campus<br>of prototyping and experimentation<br>and this is going to happen uh right<br>where where<br>our community is and so we use<br>a living lab process the living lab is<br>again gathering the community and asking<br>the community<br>what do you want what do you see here so<br>we gather more than 150 people<br>so the process has been going on since<br>started in<br>september last in may of this year<br>last year last year so we've been having<br>this circles<br>uh gathering and and creating<br>co-creating<br>both the event and and the the the<br>prototyping of the campus uh<br>in montreal so i think this<br>is uh possible this is maybe a little<br>bit off from what we are traditional<br>doing in our world of landscape<br>architecture but i think his empowers is<br>that<br>it's a way of of of is the soft design<br>as i have mentioned<br>and it gives us i think it changed uh uh<br>uh produces a new culture of<br>collaboration and i think this is what<br>is important<br>all of the people that are invited here<br>are the people that we feel that are<br>part of it and then we ask<br>the others is there somebody else that<br>tell the project what the the process is<br>called uh<br>imagining cap city montreal so it's uh<br>this is what comes out there is a<br>graphic facilitation so we we we harvest<br>everything that is that is said and then<br>it<br>we make sense again so we use this to<br>make sense<br>and so here we go back to bacon lots<br>so this is the old uh this is not our<br>building but it's similar to that we are<br>in another uh<br>part of the city where uh industrial<br>area uh where they were the the<br>clothing uh manufacturing and this empty<br>lot<br>that is sitting here uh is um<br>is again another uh um opportunity<br>for exploration so in principle the<br>campus is going to be<br>gathered here for the summer if it<br>happens next year and<br>um uh this is interesting because this<br>site here was um was a uh<br>the manufacture the the building that<br>was demolished from the side was a a<br>building uh um armament<br>um uh building that was built uh for the<br>second world world and and women most of<br>women were<br>were working on this as they were on the<br>manufacturing here<br>so this site is um<br>the city the the the borough wants to<br>build their new uh<br>city hall so with the idea of developing<br>a a project or prototyping the site<br>uh for the campus we were also uh<br>be involved with them on on on imagining<br>what will this site will be<br>for a city hall that is connected to its<br>citizens<br>so this is just a first plan that was<br>drawn<br>on the process using the same process<br>as i was describing before we had uh<br>small groups<br>gathering conveying around different<br>topics<br>so there was a one group talking about<br>the design of the site so this will be a<br>temporary site<br>for uh the the different people that<br>will come and prototype<br>around fab labs and the fab city but<br>also<br>we'll be thinking okay what's there what<br>what<br>how can we uh prototype or or explore or<br>practice how uh the next iteration of<br>the site could be<br>and um it's a<br>very interesting so as a as a<br>conclusion please um<br>well i thank you first for listening to<br>me and and and<br>and allowing me to to to share<br>with you uh this notion of uh<br>reconnecting<br>and uh i think um<br>in our um what comes from this whole<br>process and my own experience is<br>um the the need for for maybe<br>consider and and really embrace in ours<br>and our profession<br>to be the stewards of the land as as<br>really as as a way of<br>working as being more as a facilitator<br>of the processes and the the the<br>collective uh<br>intelligence that is out there and and<br>um so<br>i i this the definition of stuart was<br>tours of the of the commons<br>so we we are there to service so that's<br>i think to me<br>that's an interesting posture how do we<br>put ourselves<br>in service off and and and develop<br>and and go through the process of<br>deconstructing ourselves on what we had<br>learned from and and and be uh an active<br>um uh contributor to the to our cities<br>and to our environment so<br>really is my computer or your or the<br>line because i'm<br>your your sound your voice is coming<br>really<br>i don't know i'm hearing it<br>no<br>i don't know what's going on no better<br>better better<br>that's better yeah yeah it just happened<br>all right<br>um i was just saying thank you very much<br>for the inspiring lecture<br>and for taking us through the beautiful<br>city of montreal<br>um i very found memories of the time<br>visiting<br>montreal back in 2017 and having you as<br>our host was great<br>um rickell while<br>people prepare their questions i would<br>like to kick start<br>with at a landscape architect<br>and you know myself also having a lot to<br>do with participatory design<br>yes uh it's quite an interesting thing<br>to bring communities together and to<br>brainstorm with them<br>what are the biggest challenges that you<br>faced while dealing with communities as<br>well as with the different stakeholders<br>such as<br>uh city councils and and you know and<br>politicians that tend to be um<br>very afraid of of precipitatory design<br>yes<br>well i i think i think we<br>we have to be very humble<br>and we have to think that um whatever we<br>can do<br>we will do it the best we can and uh<br>because you know at the beginning you<br>think you can change uh the whole thing<br>the whole system<br>and uh no it's i think it's a culture<br>change<br>it's a real it's deep i mean this is um<br>this is not something that is just uh uh<br>uh<br>a superficial or or another tool is a<br>deep<br>uh uh a change in culture so<br>um as as you can see you know when when<br>you when<br>you have like we had in notre dame uh<br>the the mayor<br>being so open to to uh<br>to go through the process and even you<br>know i didn't mention that but<br>uh when we did the first workshop<br>there was a group that held back<br>and started talking to a lot of people<br>saying don't go there because this is<br>the politician<br>and they want to bring so we had to deal<br>with that<br>and we said whoever is coming is coming<br>and then you know he had to deal with<br>his political<br>background and and said it do you know<br>shift that but i think<br>i think it's um it's uh it's a culture<br>change<br>there is even in this project for um<br>for the shounder mass at this moment<br>there was a competition<br>um uh for a completely different project<br>is<br>is resolving a major infrastructure<br>problem that i had<br>been there for a long time so um<br>uh i was i was invited as a jury for the<br>for the for the competition and also<br>i we were three uh professionals that<br>work with the the winner to continue uh<br>follow up on the development of the<br>project<br>and um uh<br>i knew that that another group had done<br>some participatory processes on the<br>project to to see what people saw and<br>wanted to<br>have and when the when we were talking<br>and developing the project<br>they completely evacuated that<br>information<br>so it was uh it was interesting because<br>i knew<br>i knew that was because i kept on asking<br>you know what came out from the<br>the citizens process and you know what<br>what how is this<br>going to inform uh the designers and<br>they said oh<br>it was not important so i think it's a<br>it's a it's a time for<br>you know you just have to do it the more<br>we do it and the more we probably<br>to make the small changes um i i think i<br>have this<br>um from ezio manzini from from uh he's<br>a social innovator and and he has a<br>program in a<br>polytechnic or milan and he said that<br>the forwards are<br>small local open and connected so<br>you know be close to the community and<br>then<br>make will change but stay connected<br>because there are other communities<br>doing the same things all over the place<br>and when all these get connected then<br>it becomes um the capacity to change the<br>great answer questions from our<br>participants<br>okay so there is one on a chat box<br>raquel<br>i'll read it to you from email<br>by line i want to ask what do you mean<br>with prototype<br>and how do you see it i did not figure<br>out because<br>um prototype prototype<br>just another the more um um<br>easy way of of of<br>conveying that in industrial design<br>is where you see it about the most you<br>know you prototype you design something<br>and then you make the object and you<br>prototype it<br>in order to see how it works you know uh<br>oh what is uh how it functions is this<br>the right form is it<br>so you prototype until and then you do<br>iterations<br>and then until you find the best because<br>you have<br>uh you have make it function and you<br>have seen you know what's not working<br>or maybe the material we use is not good<br>so that's<br>prototyping and an object prototyping<br>uh uh as uh as um in a in<br>the universe that we're talking about<br>which is public uh uh<br>participation prototyping is um<br>i'm gonna refer to a project that that<br>was on another um<br>uh imagino uh san marc which was uh<br>transforming<br>a a church so during three months<br>there was a huge living uh lab process<br>that was put on ta<br>on the table and every two weeks uh<br>um so with uh processes of every two<br>weeks<br>two weeks you you will make sense and<br>then you come back<br>so it was the idea the first was to to<br>say<br>uh to ask the citizens what were they<br>dreaming about what was the the whole<br>community<br>that was imagining how do we transform<br>this church you know what can we become<br>of this church and then there was all<br>different people coming in<br>people you know escalating and making<br>the market so all these different things<br>were the dreams<br>so for these two weeks we were holding<br>workshops and inviting the community at<br>different times to come<br>and deposit their their dreams<br>and then we make sense and then we come<br>and come back<br>and we will prototype a market<br>have you ever seen a market in the<br>church not really but let's prototype it<br>let's make it happen you know<br>and experience it so when you make<br>things then you see oh this<br>is great i've never imagined that we<br>could be sitting selling uh you know<br>fruit in in the church or<br>whatever whatever you want to do<br>there is another project um and and so<br>by prototyping<br>what is interesting and and and and this<br>uh<br>uh living lab or social is that you<br>iterate<br>there's always there's never like a you<br>know you build something once you build<br>this done you know<br>how do we transform that also how do we<br>you know usually we we get the project<br>we build it and we go<br>you know it's really hard to be involved<br>but we should be involved because<br>people will use the space in manners<br>that we have not<br>thought about it so it would be<br>interesting to prototype to set the<br>space<br>in a certain manner with information<br>that we have and then<br>facilitate or be in the in the space and<br>see if there are other uses that we're<br>not<br>thought about it and then we can make it<br>happen you know there's a lot of<br>what we're calling the acupuncture uh<br>interventions<br>so you you do a temporary intervention<br>to see<br>how people are using the space what are<br>the needs you know do we need um<br>more seating here what kind of seating<br>do we need do we need shade<br>you know so so to be able to um to<br>experiment i think this is the word<br>so prototyping will be um there is<br>another<br>if i fma event that i didn't mention<br>uh is called 101 days this is a citizen<br>project that was born in bogota uh<br>by connection from from amsterdam and<br>and this every year<br>hundred activities were happening in one<br>day<br>and this was to make the citizens<br>activate themselves and sometimes the<br>citizen uh<br>looks outside and says oh my god you<br>know there are no flowers or there is no<br>planting or there is no sitting area<br>around<br>and you know or the crossing is really<br>bad you know how can we make this<br>crossing better<br>but you don't act because this is not<br>what he you know we're brought into you<br>know<br>the city you complain to the city you<br>know you go to the<br>to the city hall and then he says you<br>know you haven't done this i voted for<br>you<br>so how can you transform that energy<br>into an active energy<br>so during three months<br>we will do workshops with the citizens<br>about the dreams<br>and and then and make it prototype of<br>uh i will give an example that is a<br>beautiful one about this kid that was<br>nine years old<br>and he was he he lived in an area where<br>he had to cross this really through fair<br>every day to go to uh his his school and<br>and he was just a nightmare you know he<br>couldn't go alone back<br>because you know he had to be with his<br>mother because he was<br>he felt insecure so his idea was to do<br>uh you say a doc duck crossing you know<br>when you see ducks<br>crossing a family of dots you see cake<br>crossing everybody stops so he<br>prototyped<br>huge dogs uh um<br>uh and and the whole day that one day so<br>the whole family had this<br>images of the dog family crossing the<br>street<br>so for the whole day he played diet you<br>know he prototyped<br>a way of showing to the to the cars<br>that he wanted to he was he wanted to be<br>seen and to be respected and be in a<br>more secure<br>uh way so prototyping is making<br>something experiencing iterator until<br>he responds to the needs of whoever<br>is using it thank you very much<br>i i understand no okay<br>thank you um ricardo one last question<br>from a participant tina<br>can you talk about how professional<br>practice can make time for engaging<br>different fields<br>like the fab lab or does this kind of<br>work<br>exists outside of private<br>practice can you repeat the question<br>again<br>can you talk about how professional<br>practice<br>can make time for engaging different<br>fields<br>like the fab lab or does this kind of<br>work<br>exists outside of private<br>in brackets for profit practice<br>uh i think this is a it is<br>a challenge i think it's a challenge of<br>of there is there is a lot of people<br>doing this now<br>there is a lot of groups that are<br>involved and then they<br>they the group that i work with is the<br>percolab which is a<br>more facilitator so they we do the<br>project but<br>coming directly from our practice um<br>uh<br>it does exist and i think<br>there are some other groups<br>practitioners that have decided to work<br>but it is it is a challenge to to shift<br>and to<br>because sometimes this is not where the<br>the<br>the paid uh commissions are going to<br>come<br>you know so so it is um i think i think<br>the more we do it the more<br>uh the more it will become uh i will i<br>hope not mainstream but<br>it become uh a way of doing it in a way<br>of<br>and not a separate um because this is<br>a little bit of of you know my practice<br>i do and sometimes i said okay i'll do<br>this traditional project<br>and then i come back and i do this<br>project so i'm i'm i'm still<br>kind of like navigating between these<br>two worlds and<br>so the more i you know at one point is<br>just to<br>just to see how we can you know make it<br>happening<br>just in in in one and and and be<br>well
