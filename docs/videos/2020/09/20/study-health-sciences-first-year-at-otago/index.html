kerman<br>with us and we also have a<br>student from pharmacy isabelle at<br>mclaughlin so welcome<br>to you both thank you yeah kiara and uh<br>can we start with you joe please tell us<br>a little bit about health sciences first<br>year it's a very popular program<br>great so health sciences first year is<br>really a gateway program to our<br>professional<br>health science courses so things like<br>medicine dentistry<br>pharmacy radiation technology<br>oral health there's many many different<br>pathways that you can go to as well<br>and also for students who are interested<br>in the health sciences in general so<br>thinking about biomedical sciences or<br>health science degrees<br>wonderful thank you very much um<br>isabella can i ask ask you next what's<br>it like being a health sci first year<br>student<br>um i think you can expect that it is<br>going to be a hard year you know you're<br>being thrown into<br>a deep end most i'd say majority of<br>students coming straight from high<br>school so it's a lot different<br>you know you're probably living living<br>away from home you're living in a hall<br>lots of different social events going on<br>as well as trying to juggle all your<br>studies and<br>you know it's four papers in the first<br>semester so it is a big step up and i'd<br>say it's a lot different from high<br>school especially with the studying<br>techniques as well so looking back on<br>your experience you were well supported<br>doing healthside first year<br>yes of course so i was in one of the<br>halls in otago and the halls offer great<br>support they offer tutoring<br>even the course coordinators as well if<br>you're struggling with certain areas you<br>can always go in and talk to lecturers<br>if you make the time<br>there is tutors being run through the<br>past<br>papers as well so the uni offers a great<br>support system for students wonderful<br>thank you<br>joe back to you i wonder um not every<br>student who does healthside first year<br>will want to or will be able to do a<br>professional program<br>what else can healthsci first year lead<br>on to so<br>as i mentioned earlier they can go into<br>health sciences in general so there's<br>biomedical science degrees but there's<br>also<br>many many different health science<br>programs that actually teach into the<br>health science first year program and so<br>i think one way i look at this program<br>is it's a bit of a smorgasbord of<br>different<br>um different aspects of biomedical<br>science and so you can<br>learn about things like neuroscience or<br>immunology<br>you can learn about biochemistry as well<br>as chemistry<br>and physics so you get a really nice<br>perspective of the different sciences<br>and now even we have a little bit of<br>humanities in in the course as well<br>so students get this real really nice<br>taste of many many different aspects of<br>health sciences and more broadly<br>speaking sciences and even now in the<br>arts<br>and so there's a lot of directions that<br>you can take from that base<br>fantastic thank you actually i was<br>talking today with a student who's doing<br>the population health paper<br>his name's aj um and he was saying how<br>exciting he was to be doing this because<br>with this world of covert<br>it's more relevant than ever so he was<br>really buzzing about that and it was<br>just lovely to<br>to have a word with him earlier today<br>isabella can we go back to you for a<br>second now and<br>can we say what advice would you have<br>for healthsci first year students<br>coming in next year um i think it would<br>be to keep your mind open to the<br>opportunities that the health science<br>course can lead to<br>like joe said there are a lot other a<br>lot of other options that can be taken<br>from the health sciences program there's<br>a lot of different pathways you can go<br>i think another good piece of advice is<br>to set your own goals so set personal<br>goals for yourself<br>you know you don't want to be setting<br>goals that your roommate or your next<br>door neighbor has in the hall it's<br>really important that you set ones that<br>are going to make you happy and are<br>going to help you succeed in your<br>university career<br>thank you good advice joe i know that<br>one aspect<br>of the health sciences program is youcat<br>can you<br>tell us a sentence or two about that<br>please to provide information sure so<br>you cat i think probably<br>um a lot of students hear about it and<br>are a little bit nervous about it it's<br>the university clinical aptitude<br>test and it's basically testing um<br>it's a it's a test that gets used to<br>measure certain qualities in people<br>who are going into clinical programs and<br>so that would be medicine and dentistry<br>for example<br>and um it looks at reasoning it looks at<br>making judgments and it looks at making<br>learning how to make decisions<br>and you can't study for it but you can<br>prepare for it and it's<br>held outside of the university and so<br>students get the opportunity to get some<br>practice with that it's not as<br>terrifying as what it may appear<br>i like hearing the fact that it's not<br>terrifying because you know sometimes<br>out in the community we do hear how<br>scary it is so joe what would be your<br>best advice<br>for students coming into healthside<br>first year next year<br>my best advice would be to be organised<br>bring your a game<br>but also try and be balanced and so and<br>get some down time<br>enjoy the social aspects of being in a<br>residential college<br>and try and stay on top of your material<br>so engage whenever you've got the<br>opportunity to engage<br>wonderful thank you so much indeed so if<br>you have further questions about<br>healthsci first year<br>join in the virtual chat<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
