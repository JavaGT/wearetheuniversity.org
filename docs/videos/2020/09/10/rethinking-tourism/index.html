Her work focuses on social justice issues in tourism, hospitality, and events. She has worked with communities, non-governmental organisations and businesses that seek to harness tourism for human rights, justice, and equitable futures.<br><br>Topic: Socialising tourism: A reset agenda<br><br>Crises of overtourism, protests over tourism impacts and actual shutting down of tourism locations suggest that pre-COVID 19, tourism was reaching social and ecological limits. The proposal to ‘socialise tourism’ offers a way forward by re-centering tourism on the rights, interests, and needs of the local community where tourism occurs. In fact, Indigenous cultures (such as Māori and Aboriginal Australians) offer us examples of such socialisation as protocols and ceremonies were used to socialise the stranger and set the terms of welcome and engagement. This proposed agenda resets tourism to serve the public good and situates it within a context of social and ecological limits. Such an approach better ensures tourism supports rather than undermines equity, social justice, ecological justice, and well-being.<br><br><br>Dr Chris Bottrill<br><br>Dr. Chris Bottrill is a Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington Tourism Management graduate and is the current elected Chair of Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA). Chris is the current Director, International at Capilano University, Vancouver, BC and past Dean of three different Faculties overseeing schools of Tourism, Business, Motion Picture Arts, Outdoor Recreation, Human Kinetics and others. He has taught a wide array of tourism and management subjects in universities in Canada, New Zealand, USA, and Austria, and has designed and facilitated seven youth symposiums with over 20 universities in the Asia Pacific over the past four years. Chris has strong interests in human capital development in the tourism industry and has focused of late on the future of work and education and has presented on these topics at conferences and events in Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Canada over the last two years. He has completed over 50 tourism development projects around the globe. Recent activities include directing an acclaimed Vietnam Community Based Tourism project aimed at protecting ethnic hill tribe culture through tourism, and leading a Pacific Asia study on Indigenous Tourism and Human Rights.<br><br>Topic: The future for human capital development in tourism<br><br>Will my job in tourism be taken over by a robot? It’s a fair question, because in many cases, it already has. We would like to think that tourism is a people industry, so how do we make that case in the future? We have some tough challenges ahead to build our industry with relevant, progressive, and accessible training and credentials that are of value to the sector and individuals that invest in them. This session will look at the future of jobs in our industry and the challenge and opportunity that disruptive innovation presents through AI, robotics, big data, and other digital transformations in our sector. We will explore the future and needs of human capital development and the way that COVID-19 has accelerated and changed the way we educate and train and will need to, in the future.<br><br><br>Professor Karen Smith<br><br>Karen Smith is Professor of Tourism Management and Associate Dean (Learning and Teaching) for the Wellington School of Business and Government.

She is Chair of the Tourism Educators Forum Aotearoa and First Vice-Chair of CAUTHE – the Council for Australasian Tourism and Hospitality Education.<br><br>Topic: Cultivating tourism ambassadors in our communities<br><br>Interactions with people and cultures are core elements of what makes an outstanding visitor experience. Yet a community’s engagement with tourism can’t be taken for granted and negative impacts can bring tourism’s social license to operate into question. A commitment to quality jobs and decent work is important, as are volunteering opportunities in order to nurture tourism ambassadors who can enhance the experience of tourists and positively engage communities in tourism.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so<br>sorry that's a very quick um rehash of<br>my brief me<br>to welcome you to this um<br>webinar and i should have checked my my<br>mute button<br>so welcome to this final webinar in a<br>series of webinars hosted by<br>um the school of management at victoria<br>university of wellington<br>and it is about rethinking tourism and<br>it is our final<br>seminar in that series and<br>rethinking tourism is important because<br>the shock that we have experienced<br>that's affected all sectors of<br>the tourism world in new zealand and<br>elsewhere has of course<br>left a huge trail of destruction but<br>also provides<br>a platform for us to really rethink<br>reconsider where we want<br>tourism to go and<br>in that framing i would like to<br>introduce our speakers today<br>which will talk broadly about<br>how they would like to reimagine tourism<br>and in our series of webinars we've had<br>many different<br>perspectives presented and as a summary<br>of today's webinar i would<br>say that it is very much um a social<br>element that will come through quite<br>strongly from communities<br>and the social aspect and element of<br>tourism that is<br>so the the session will be chat by<br>myself<br>and we will have three excellent<br>speakers that are<br>experts in their fields joining us from<br>around the world we have<br>dr freya higgins devoe from<br>the university of south australia and<br>um tourism and then we have dr chris<br>watrol<br>who is one of our alumni and he will be<br>talking about<br>the future for human capital development<br>and he's joining us from canada<br>from capilano university in bc<br>and finally we will have professor karen<br>smith<br>who is of course our professor of<br>tourism management here at victoria<br>and she will be talking about<br>cultivating tourism ambassadors<br>so welcome to all three speakers it's a<br>great pleasure to<br>have you join us particularly seeing<br>that there are very different time zones<br>involved<br>and i really look forward to bringing<br>these three wonderful perspectives<br>together<br>that undoubtedly will lead to some<br>interesting discussion<br>okay um so i would like to briefly<br>introduce<br>freya before i hand over to her freyja<br>is a senior lecturer in tourism<br>management in the business unit at the<br>university of south australia<br>and her work focuses on social justice<br>issues and tourism hospitality and<br>events<br>she has worked with communities<br>non-governmental organizations and<br>businesses<br>that seek to harness tourism for human<br>rights<br>justice and equitable futures<br>over to eufreya thank you christian<br>and thank you everyone for joining us<br>today<br>i'm really honored to be in this series<br>where we've had such good speakers<br>presenting ideas on what we might do<br>to rethink tourism after covert 19.<br>so my name's freya and i'm speaking to<br>you in adelaide from<br>garner country it's garner land here<br>and we acknowledge the traditional<br>custodians of country<br>as a way of understanding the<br>relationship between people<br>in place and honoring the care that<br>they've done for country<br>over millennia and the really important<br>point to understand in this<br>is about relatedness my concept of<br>socializing tourism which i'm going to<br>introduce to you today is about this<br>idea of relatedness and with that comes<br>responsibility<br>and possibly an idea of reciprocity<br>and i also honor the maori people of new<br>zealand<br>as i'm speaking today because indigenous<br>knowledges<br>have helped shape some of the thinking<br>of what i'm doing<br>i'd like to thank the people who have<br>organized this and this includes<br>christian for being the moderator<br>and ian for doing a lot of the footwork<br>as well<br>as colette and abby for making these<br>things happen<br>and the speakers that have gone before<br>particularly people like anna carr who<br>spoke<br>in the last session and who really<br>impressed me with their thinking<br>um christian could you go to the next<br>so my question is why socialize what is<br>it that brought me to this thinking<br>and i'd like to note that in a 2018<br>survey in hawaii there was an item that<br>surveyed the question<br>our islands are being run for tourists<br>at the expense of locals and this was in<br>2018 by the<br>hawaii tourist authority so this alerts<br>us to a problem with tourism and that's<br>really the context i'd like to situate<br>this idea<br>of why do we need to socialize tourism<br>so that's the presentation i'd like to<br>do first is just to lay this<br>understanding<br>that something's wrong with tourism and<br>that we need to change it<br>so my images here include venice at the<br>top and we do know some of the stories<br>coming out of the places<br>experiencing overturism about<br>communities having grave problems with<br>the imposition of tourism upon them<br>so in a place like venice you've seen<br>things like the cruise ships and day<br>trippers<br>being accused of extracting um from<br>venice and giving very little back and<br>in fact leaving<br>negative impacts i've also written about<br>the cruise ships as one of the problems<br>of tourism with<br>about 70 to 80 of that market being<br>based on what i call<br>exploitation and i give an analysis of<br>that that the profit model is actually<br>at the expense of<br>the crew who are not in good working<br>conditions frequently<br>in this mass model that i'm talking<br>about<br>secondly there is use of the<br>destinations with giving too little in<br>return and that's where some of the<br>controversies come from<br>from and thirdly the environmental<br>impacts that they have<br>the last example i'll give is the recent<br>20<br>august 18 2020 statement by the u.n<br>world tourism organization<br>pushing for a restart of tourism and<br>claiming it's no time<br>for timid leadership i was actually<br>quite disappointed by this<br>statement particularly with the world<br>health organization a sister body of the<br>unwto<br>in the human system warning to be<br>cautious as we face second waves<br>so what these things show me is that<br>tourism is out of balance and in fact we<br>emphasize<br>tourism at the expense of societies in<br>these cases<br>so that's the basis for my thinking on<br>this christian could you please go to<br>the next slide so<br>what i'm arguing is tourism matters and<br>it's worth struggling for<br>while we're encoded we know this because<br>we've seen border shut<br>and truism hospitality events and arts<br>and cultural industries shut down<br>and what it's done is it's shown us just<br>how reliant we are<br>on these industries for our jobs and our<br>um economic growth and our incomes and<br>so we're hearing some statements um<br>estimating there might be an 80<br>decline in international tourism um as a<br>result of covert 19<br>that there's going to be a one point<br>trillion u.s dollars loss<br>coming to tourism export revenues and<br>with this will come a loss of<br>some 120 million jobs in tourism<br>as a result of this so this is grave but<br>i'd also like to point out that there's<br>some things that we need to be<br>thoughtful about<br>for instance bali which is a<br>tourism-dependent economy<br>is finding people really struggling and<br>so to me this raises the question about<br>tourism dependence<br>and there's been a talk about people<br>returning to the rice fields and their<br>farm farm family farms in this situation<br>to try to survive and of course i'd like<br>to ask why the cruise<br>industry um mistreated many of its crew<br>labor<br>um in the crisis here in australia as we<br>watch the ruby princess<br>and these other stranded ships there<br>really was a pronounced<br>lack of concern by the wider community<br>and by governmental authorities in my<br>opinion<br>with some thousands of crew who were in<br>grave difficulty as a result of this<br>could i have the next slide please<br>so in socializing tourism i've used that<br>word as a provocation<br>you know in uh australian and british<br>and american politics to call somebody a<br>socialist is actually<br>a pejorative um term so i'm using it as<br>a provocation<br>but it's actually a very rich term to<br>think about what socializing might mean<br>so from the dictionary i've pulled these<br>ideas about<br>the idea of spending time with other<br>people the idea that we're socializing<br>people to behave in a particular way<br>that society considers good<br>and it could also mean provided for by<br>the government and<br>all of these things challenge our<br>thinking about what we might do<br>but i do want to note with coping 19<br>what we've seen is a really<br>important moment when we've seen that<br>neo-liberalism doesn't deliver what we<br>need and the market doesn't deliver what<br>we need<br>what we've returned to in this crisis is<br>idea of community<br>and our societies and caring and<br>well-being within<br>within this so it gives us a really<br>thought provocative moment<br>to ask what do we want to do when we<br>emerge from this situation<br>so could i have the next side please<br>christian<br>i'm calling socializing tourism is an<br>effort to make tourism responsive and<br>answerable<br>to the society in which it occurs this<br>is<br>based upon putting tourism in its proper<br>place and so going back to that u.n<br>statement that that unwto statement that<br>it's no time for tibbett leadership<br>that's prioritizing tourism over the<br>well-being of people and societies so<br>that's what's important about this<br>definition that i'm offering<br>and tourism's proper place is at the<br>service of the local community<br>could you advance the sides please<br>christian<br>so with this i've given a definition in<br>some of my work<br>which moves away from a definition<br>centered on the tourist or the tourism<br>industry<br>and to emphasize the local community as<br>the basis<br>of tourism going forward so in<br>socializing tourism what i'm proposing<br>is we make the local communities rights<br>interests needs and benefits<br>the center of tourism and you can see in<br>this model<br>um and it's in my writing to look at<br>more detail that it then demands things<br>of every other player in this such as<br>government<br>supporting community interest in tourism<br>that the tourists come as guests and not<br>as demanding<br>customers that the tourism industry<br>changes its attitude<br>to seek a social license to operate now<br>we do already have examples of this<br>um in our current situation so for<br>instance<br>maori protocols of welcoming people to<br>the mirai<br>actually socializes people in how to<br>behave in a respectful way<br>on the country on the lands of<br>indigenous peoples<br>we have leery tourism here in um arnhem<br>land in<br>northern territory of australia which<br>actually has a set of principles that<br>says<br>you come and you visit according to our<br>principles and it actually sets it out<br>to say<br>tourism is not our priority we welcome<br>you as a visitor but other things may<br>take priority as a result of this<br>i also think new zealand's chiaki<br>promise<br>is a great example of this in that<br>campaign<br>of asking visitors to come as conscious<br>custodians of the<br>new zealand beautiful environment rather<br>than as takers<br>and receivers of the beauty of the<br>country<br>that you actually are invited to be<br>custodians<br>so when you look at this together i'm<br>proposing a process of how we might<br>socialize tourism<br>it starts with that redefining tourism<br>and then what i'm asking for is that all<br>public monies used for tourism<br>go to tourism for the public good and<br>that's in a contrast<br>to what i see at the moment for instance<br>in national parks<br>where we're seeing privatization and<br>private companies making profits off of<br>our industry<br>and actually being subsidized by the<br>government to do that<br>so i'm not saying we get rid of<br>commercial tourism but what i am saying<br>is that public monies promote tourism<br>for the public good<br>and with that then we socialize tourism<br>to serve the local community<br>and what we might see is some things<br>being fostered that have been<br>overshadowed in recent years such as<br>tourism for<br>education things like school camps and<br>exchanges<br>or citizen science and tourism for<br>conservation<br>and we've also got exchanges and the<br>regenerative work that can be done that<br>we heard about in the last session<br>that was offered here so i've come to my<br>end of my talk<br>my main statement is tourism serves the<br>society and that we need to change it<br>and reset the agenda<br>so that it does actually become a<br>service to the communities in which it<br>operates<br>and then we won't see these problems<br>that i started out my talk with<br>i'm looking for collaborators in this<br>work and i hope that this talk has been<br>interesting<br>because i invite people to join me on<br>what should be an exciting<br>reset agenda thank you all very much<br>thank you very much freya um thank you<br>for that<br>very interesting and very<br>thought-provoking discussion<br>and i think it really resonates with a<br>lot of feelings<br>in certainly in new zealand and<br>australia<br>where also a lot of academics are having<br>similar conversations as we look at<br>resetting tourism<br>so thank you very much for for kicking<br>us off in this way and i should point<br>out that<br>we have got the q a<br>tab open so please post your<br>questions there that would be preferred<br>over the chat option<br>which is not modest monitored as much<br>and we will reserve<br>the q a session right until the end<br>until all three speakers<br>have had an opportunity to share their<br>their different insights and their<br>research<br>so i would now like to um focus<br>on our second speaker dr chris paltrow<br>and he will talk about the future for<br>human capital development and tourism<br>sorry a topic also very close to my<br>heart<br>and i would just like to briefly<br>introduce uh<br>chris before i give him the stage<br>so chris is of course a graduate<br>of ours and i don't know which is more<br>important that or the fact that he's the<br>current elected chair of<br>the pacific asia travel association i<br>think probably equal<br>equal importance and he is also the<br>current director<br>international at capilano university in<br>vancouver bc<br>and the past dean of three different<br>faculties<br>overseeing schools of tourism business<br>motion picture arts outdoor recreation<br>human kinetics and others wow i'm<br>interested<br>in the human kinetics one and he taught<br>a<br>wide array of tourism and management<br>subjects and universities in canada new<br>zealand usa<br>austria and has designed and facilitated<br>seven youth symposia<br>with over 20 universities so i think in<br>summary this is a really good<br>introduction<br>to why chris talks about human capital<br>development from his experience<br>over to you chris thank you very much<br>christian uh it's a uh a real pleasure<br>to<br>be here and participate today i had the<br>good pleasure of connecting with uh<br>ian yeoman at the uh unwto part of<br>guilin forum just a couple of years ago<br>and so thank you for that ian it was<br>wonderful connecting and to reconnect<br>with the<br>uh the school again is terrific a<br>special<br>hello to doug pierce if you're out there<br>um<br>doug's my supervised my masters my phd<br>or my mentor<br>uh thank you so much doug um i am a new<br>zealander i'm a canadian<br>as well and i'm speaking to you from<br>vancouver on the traditional territories<br>the squamish<br>mosque seashell slay with truth and<br>little coastal salish pupils here<br>so this presentation is designed to<br>prompt some thoughts about the<br>challenges that exist<br>for us as educators really and uh the<br>future of work in our industry<br>and the way that we need to educate<br>as the future of work changes and our<br>education models change so radically<br>into the future<br>next slide please christian<br>so a little while ago uh the wttc<br>conducted analysis of talent trends<br>and um in this they suggested that in<br>the major<br>leading destinations of the planet which<br>actually were about 90 percent of travel<br>on the planet<br>there's a talent deficit shortage of<br>about 14 million people<br>and uh 600 and that equated to about 610<br>billion dollars over the next 10 years<br>this by the way is about 105 times the<br>box office sales of the lord of rings<br>trilogy<br>and two hobbit movies so it's a decent<br>chunk of change<br>and it was a pretty promising outlook<br>for us all in the business<br>next slide please christian<br>but um as we know uh there is so much<br>uncertainty ahead<br>uh not only has the industry lost about<br>100 million jobs due to covet 19 but<br>automation and new technologies are<br>replacing jobs and creating new ones and<br>we're just not entirely sure in what<br>field or how many jobs those are<br>how do we figure all of this out next<br>slide please<br>the oecd has put some numbers on it<br>actually<br>and a 2019 report on the future of jobs<br>estimates that 14 of jobs could be<br>completely automated just in general<br>terms<br>and a further 32 likely to be<br>significantly<br>changed that's half the jobs so which<br>ones are they and how does this affect<br>us in tourism<br>next slide please christian in new<br>zealand<br>uh the trends were identified some time<br>ago um<br>some interesting work has been done with<br>data of which really reflects the oecd<br>numbers<br>what we know is that uh laborers<br>operators clerical administrative sales<br>fields are under<br>really significant risk um there are<br>many fields of work to fall into these<br>categories and tourism such as<br>kitchen staff hotel operations drivers<br>of vehicles and so on<br>it was my first job in the industry by<br>the way as a tour driver as diagnosed<br>what is uh faring a little better jobs<br>with personal service attributes<br>which is good for tourism and managers<br>and professionals but it does beg the<br>question of<br>who are these managers and professionals<br>supposed to manage<br>robots perhaps go to the next slide<br>um in the jobs of the future uh which<br>are changing<br>we need to ask our question are we<br>teaching the right things<br>well the jobs such as the student here<br>who's training at<br>hong kong poly technic university's<br>hotel icon<br>which is an incredible place by the way<br>and a<br>fan a wonderful program run by kate chon<br>um will the student have a grad have a<br>job when she graduates<br>or the five years after she graduates<br>is a robot going to take her job<br>next slide please the answer actually is<br>that<br>it already has the one on the left there<br>is a customer service robot that i met<br>at taipei airport<br>and this provides flight information<br>directions and so on<br>and it also asks you to hold its hand<br>and it will tell you your age<br>it told me i was 25 so i really like<br>this particular<br>robot but then i was in the visitor<br>information center in copenhagen<br>and who should be there but that sneaky<br>robot again<br>telling its lies and charming<br>unsuspecting visitors like me<br>no doubt i think harris is telling this<br>little boy<br>uh you know the world of travel and the<br>future will be fantastic no concerns<br>about<br>anything like climate change pandemics<br>nationalist protection or anything<br>like that so these robots are being used<br>for all kinds of purposes<br>retail travel hospitality financial<br>services restaurants<br>health care other customer facing<br>applications<br>and it's not the future it's the present<br>according to the robotic industries<br>association<br>in 2018 sales of robots grew 53<br>customer service robots grew on a<br>robot's channel<br>grew 53 and no this is customer service<br>i'm sorry grew 53 over previous year<br>which is about 7<br>000 units in the next two years they<br>estimate 40<br>500 of these customer service robots<br>will be sold and nearly half of these<br>will be in the asia pacific<br>so it's not quite filling the 14 million<br>talent gap that<br>wtt says but certainly edging on the way<br>towards it<br>a distinct value-added characteristic of<br>these robots is that they're data<br>collectors as well and they can add<br>information about you<br>now in terms of uh the data projections<br>for new zealand the same patterns exist<br>in in the us and as you can see in this<br>data sheet from mckinsey and company<br>2016<br>a lot of the jobs are in in<br>in automated or in<br>areas which are traditional which<br>what we consider traditional repetitive<br>industries are going<br>and uh even in food and beverage and<br>areas like that in areas that we thought<br>that there was<br>a lot of customer service activity those<br>are going to<br>there's now fully automated hotels such<br>as fly zoo<br>hotel which is alibaba and a marriott<br>collaboration in china<br>which uses facial screening for<br>elevators accessing<br>rooms and payments the robots serve you<br>they clean the hotel they make drinks<br>um and various other things like that<br>in nagasaki japan hinna hotel<br>is a little more creepy actually and<br>this one's fully run by robots<br>you can be checked in by a humanoid<br>receptionist<br>with a rubber face or a dinosaur with a<br>porter hat<br>they'll take the bags to your room and<br>the whole thing is cleaned and signed by<br>zumbas which read our houses along with<br>alex's series and google<br>and so on already in terms of uh<br>data uh collection and data processing<br>we would have thought those areas were<br>quite safe<br>but in fact uh those are also changing<br>as well<br>dorchester hotels for example has<br>implemented ai system<br>which can read 7 000 reviews in a minute<br>and pinpoint exactly what customers want<br>i took this photo two years ago on a<br>subway in seoul in south korea<br>as you might notice no one is<br>interacting with anybody else<br>this is not an unusual scene it's a very<br>common scene of course<br>it's just their phones um<br>if i could ask you if anybody knows when<br>the iphone was announced<br>uh i would be it'd be interesting to<br>know your answer<br>but just if you said it 13 years ago<br>you'd be right<br>january the 9th 2007 just 13 years ago<br>in that time frame everything has<br>changed and it's changed for the future<br>of work<br>and with it the future of education and<br>how this applies to us<br>we're not sure yet what's coming next is<br>equally if not uh um<br>uh silly if not equally then certainly<br>highly significant<br>elon musk's spacex and starlink is um<br>is already being launched with 11 000<br>satellites going into the sky there are<br>already 700<br>this will have uh easy online access<br>for anyone around the world and<br>especially<br>uh for emerging economies where we know<br>the populations are large<br>this creates increased opportunities but<br>increased competition<br>changing jobs and we have to ask<br>ourselves the question who's going to<br>adapt the quickest<br>subtly in fact amidst all this<br>uncertainty and the difficulty that<br>covert 19 has presented it's also thrown<br>us into the future for education<br>delivery<br>in a matter of two weeks uh one billion<br>people<br>a seventh of the planet moved to online<br>education<br>it's astounding that that would have<br>that had happened<br>normally that would have taken years to<br>implement<br>next slide please until then<br>uh some institutions were adapting but<br>they were not to the extent currently or<br>at the extent in the private sector<br>in the business community there's long<br>since figured out that people want to<br>learn<br>anytime anywhere and on their schedule<br>now this<br>is cucumber it's a boutique organization<br>member of potter actually<br>and uh it's a good example of one which<br>is just catering directly to<br>uh to the business sector needs<br>but large tech companies have<br>increasingly become<br>involved in online delivery 10 cent go<br>scott and<br>just got made major additional<br>investments<br>and the industry is projected to reach<br>not before covert 19 did we understand<br>about<br>zoom teams webex and blue jeans but we<br>know all about it now<br>the changing education landscape is<br>directly linked to this future of jobs<br>and how we prepare the for the next<br>generation of the workforce<br>managers are not sending anybody to<br>university<br>night schools or anything like that<br>anymore those kinds of<br>continuing education programs are not<br>not doing well<br>in large part they're not even sending<br>the four-year degrees in many cases<br>they're sending to lynda.com to get an<br>art skills upgrade or maybe udemy<br>which has 295 million course enrolments<br>and teaches 50 million students around<br>the world<br>now the fourth industrial revolution has<br>brought these changes and there is<br>advice out there and it's consistent<br>advice in some cases<br>10 skills that are suggested to survive<br>in this world are<br>complex problem solving critical<br>thinking creativity people management<br>coordination with others judgment<br>decision making service orientation<br>and what we do really well in in<br>our education spheres are these kinds of<br>things<br>where we focus on cognitive<br>interpersonal and interpersonal skill<br>sets<br>this is the kind of thing that we do<br>really well<br>but we are going to have to think about<br>how to<br>upskill in a very short time frame and<br>give the kinds of uh<br>skill sets that people need to excel in<br>their in their fields<br>there's one youtuber tidal wave<br>commented on the future jobs with all<br>the uncertainty<br>he had three suggestions focus focus on<br>yourself<br>and find out what it will take to<br>succeed find out what you're good at<br>and want to keep getting better at and<br>do it<br>better at forever and explore one thing<br>that can be valuable to others<br>not bad advice with that foundation then<br>your skill<br>from there now tourism uh<br>as you as we know there are really three<br>things i want to suggest that we need to<br>think about<br>we need to stop in tourism education we<br>need to stop teaching courses<br>that will be useless in four years and<br>really think about the structure and<br>length of our programs<br>we need to focus on how we think<br>interact with others and communicate and<br>collaborate<br>and apply this to different dynamic<br>skill sets on as needed basis<br>and we need to figure out how to make<br>sure that human interaction<br>is going to be an essential component of<br>our industry and decide<br>that a robot is not going to take the<br>job over the previous picture<br>had a picture of a suitcase and as one<br>global<br>leader mentioned tourism has not had a<br>particularly good reputation for being<br>an innovative it took us 30 years to<br>figure out<br>after humans had landed on the moon that<br>it was a good idea to put wheels on a<br>suitcase<br>but as you see from the next slide<br>we are definitely getting better so<br>thank you for listening i hope that was<br>of interest i hope it sparks some<br>thought on the matter are we doing the<br>right thing in education<br>are we keeping pace and what are we<br>trying to keep pace with<br>thank you thank you very much chris um<br>sorry i was<br>uh taking you along a little bit with<br>the slides um<br>because i think we were beginning to go<br>over time a little bit<br>but thank you very much for that really<br>thought provoking discussion because i<br>i have very similar thoughts about the<br>future<br>well even current education it's not<br>even the future<br>of education anymore there's something<br>very profound that we need to look at<br>particularly if we<br>take on board what freyja talked about<br>and then if we take away what<br>karen will talk about all of this has<br>significant implications<br>for our education so on that note i<br>would like to now introduce professor<br>karen smith<br>and she will talk about cultivating<br>tourism ambassadors<br>in our communities and karen is<br>professor of tourism management<br>and associate dean for learning and<br>teaching at wellington school of<br>business and government<br>at the herrenger and her research<br>focuses on people and work and tourism<br>and events<br>and volunteer management across a range<br>of sectors<br>and we are proud to say that in 2019 she<br>was made a member of the new zealand<br>owner of merit for services to<br>volunteering and<br>education and she's also the um<br>currently the first vice chair of coffee<br>who will be<br>what will be familiar to many of you as<br>the council for australian tourism and<br>hospitality education<br>and i would now like to hand over to<br>thank you christian and curacao everyone<br>uh thanks to ian and the team for<br>putting together this really interesting<br>webinar series and inviting me<br>uh to speak uh today um<br>it's been really great to come third<br>here because i'd like to pick on<br>up on some of the themes that we've<br>heard in freyja and<br>chris's um uh presentations but i'm<br>going to bring you back to new zealand<br>and i'm going to take an unashamedly<br>new zealand focus uh to argue today that<br>the reimagining of tourism<br>and we have a vital opportunity to<br>better cultivate our communities as<br>supporters and ambassadors for tourism<br>as we've already heard today we know<br>more broadly the impacts of the global<br>pandemic<br>and have had massive economic impacts on<br>tourism<br>we've seen massively reduced tours and<br>numbers job losses<br>business closures destinations reopening<br>only to lock down again and so on<br>and we've had some different statistics<br>i've the when i picked out was the world<br>tourism<br>travel and tourism council who back in<br>june were forecasting more than 197<br>million<br>travel and tourism jobs globally being<br>lost to a prolonged travel restrictions<br>but i think that what i want to<br>emphasize today the impacts are not just<br>about the numbers they're actually about<br>the people<br>so there's business closing closures and<br>retrenching<br>are the product of years of investment<br>and commitment by the owners investors<br>and staff<br>the reduced hours and job losses are the<br>product of um<br>our people losing their income<br>livelihood and often a key part of their<br>identity in their community<br>this impacts on their families<br>economically and socially through<br>reduced incomes and well-being<br>but it also impacts on the communities<br>and where they live especially in<br>regional areas heavily dependent on<br>tourism<br>so um i'd like to go to the next<br>slide please thanks christian<br>and um talk about how in recent years um<br>we've heard an increasing use of the<br>phrase social license to operate and in<br>fact erin freya's already mentioned it<br>today<br>and i want to use it to think about how<br>we can reimagine um<br>tourism so writing and policy quarterly<br>in 2018 kevin jenkins in the new zealand<br>context<br>talks about how social license to<br>operate concept originated in the mining<br>sector but has been adopted more widely<br>in various industries including tourism<br>now partly this has been a reaction to<br>communities experience or at least<br>perceiving the negative impacts of<br>tourism<br>and so that might be in new zealand from<br>things like freedom camping<br>overseas drivers crowding and so on<br>but the fact that tourism social license<br>to operate has always been linked to the<br>rapid growth of tourism and<br>inadequate responses to managing that<br>growth<br>um however the turn towards thinking<br>about social licence to operate has also<br>been proactive in a strategic direction<br>and here i'd like to acknowledge the<br>leadership of the tourism industry at a<br>row in this regard<br>so for example in their tourism 2025 and<br>beyond<br>document they talk about the importance<br>of managing tourism and growth<br>and ensuring that new zealanders<br>continue to offer manakitanga or respect<br>and welcome to our visitors<br>and they talk about how industry<br>socializing to operate is intangible<br>but it's a very real asset that we need<br>to measure and manage<br>we also see this in the new zealand<br>tourism sustainable<br>and commitment which i think is a world<br>leading example of how we can put<br>different aspects of sustainability<br>together<br>and here we're placing host community<br>sustainability<br>alongside economic environmental and<br>visitor commitments<br>and alongside the sustainability and<br>commitment comes<br>industry goals so for example new<br>zealanders are happy with the level of<br>tourism activity<br>and support growth and tourism<br>businesses are desirable and responsible<br>employers<br>and leaders in engaging and supporting<br>vibrant communities<br>now of course next slide please<br>christian<br>so in doing this i'll be thinking about<br>um<br>how rethinking tourism and its social<br>license to operate<br>i want to think about communities as<br>tourism ambassadors<br>because actually those businesses and<br>those individuals in our communities<br>aren't just um working and taking part<br>in tourism<br>they're already active participants in<br>their communities so we think of for<br>example tourism businesses<br>who um are huge parts of their<br>communities in terms of fame<br>sponsoring local sports teams and clubs<br>donating funds<br>um in kind and support for charities and<br>good causes<br>and they're part of the communities that<br>they live<br>that they live in because these tourism<br>owners<br>investors and staff are also their<br>community civic leaders volunteers and<br>all-round goods<br>and goods sorts so what i want to do now<br>is think about four ways we can continue<br>to get communities<br>on side with tourism and further<br>cultivate them as ambassadors for our<br>sector<br>rather than just as critics so next<br>so first i want to think about our<br>communities as domestic tourists<br>so domestic tourism has been recognized<br>as a key component<br>of the short-term recovery both here in<br>new zealand but we're also seeing<br>similar trends overseas<br>while we've seen visitors in leading<br>tourism destinations such as queenstown<br>there's also been a push for new<br>zealanders to discover new places and<br>experience beyond their usual<br>school holiday hot spots this will<br>hopefully give new zealanders a deeper<br>insight into the role of tourism play in<br>our<br>plays in our communities and we hope<br>support the industry's social license to<br>operate<br>we've long recognized the importance of<br>word of mouth<br>in generating new and repeat visits and<br>as new zealanders just<br>freshly discover their own backyard we<br>need to deliver those outstanding<br>visitor experiences so that kiwis become<br>ambassadors for what new zealand has to<br>offer<br>not just to share with their neighbours<br>back home but also longer term to<br>international visitors once borders<br>start to reopen<br>vfr visiting friends and relatives has<br>always been an important part of our<br>international arrivals and the impact of<br>border restrictions has perhaps been<br>particularly heartfelt on families who<br>are separated<br>when borders start to open it's likely<br>this will be a significant cost both<br>financially and time wise<br>and the ongoing of travel in a post<br>covered will world<br>may well mean that reuniting family and<br>friends will play a significant role in<br>the<br>re-emergence of international travel we<br>need new zealand citizens and residents<br>to be ambassadors when they welcome<br>their friends and whanau<br>and to be sharing their outstanding<br>experiences that they have had of local<br>travel<br>and to be ambassadors for our tourism<br>regions and start to rebuild these<br>tourism communities<br>but it's not just as tourists that we<br>need to get new zealanders on site<br>next slide pete christian<br>um communities can also be ambassadors<br>in other ways<br>i'll start by first talking about<br>volunteering in tourism<br>so when people link tourism and<br>volunteering they typically think about<br>volunteer tourism or perhaps<br>voluntourism<br>people traveling to volunteer now<br>although this is not a sector without<br>its challenges<br>volunteer tourism can be a really<br>valuable way for new zealanders and<br>potentially<br>eventually international tourists to get<br>more deeply involved and contribute to<br>the destinations they're visiting<br>right now we can be identifying<br>promoting opportunities for kiwis<br>to lend a hand and to contribute to the<br>environments and communities that as<br>part of domestic tourism experiences<br>now this needs to be done really well to<br>ensure that neither the volunteer<br>tourists<br>nor the communities are exploited but<br>there is huge potential to grow this<br>aspect of domestic tourism<br>but i also want to highlight another way<br>that volunteers can be ambassadors for<br>tourism<br>by volunteering in their own community<br>to enhance the experience of visitors<br>we see this in the thousands of kiwis<br>who volunteer in conservation heritage<br>organizations for example<br>and while supporting tourism might not<br>be their motivation for volunteering<br>and that through their work that the<br>tourists and the tourism sector are<br>benefiting<br>from preserved landscapes and sites<br>upgraded tracks protected wildlife and<br>so on<br>and while the events sector has been<br>particularly hard hit by the current<br>alert level restrictions<br>the event sector and non-profit visitor<br>attractions are hugely<br>hugely supported by bands of dedicated<br>volunteers and i can't miss a<br>shout out to a program i've been<br>involved in the wellington city<br>ambassador program<br>and which for over almost a decade has<br>been a group of local community members<br>who've been meeting and greeting<br>visitors<br>to the city and i'd like us to think<br>about how we can build on these<br>initiatives to further engage<br>and communities in volunteering as an<br>ambassador for tourism<br>next slide p christian now chris has<br>talked about work so i'll just touch on<br>that very briefly but again<br>thinking about workers and how they act<br>as ambassadors for their communities<br>recent statistics new zealand data<br>showed the impact of tourism job losses<br>has disproportionately affected maori<br>and particularly maori women's jobs in<br>tourism<br>there's also been a significant drop in<br>hours worked and<br>coupled with low at weekly earnings in<br>tourism it's a significant concern<br>so as we think about cultivating<br>communities ambassadors<br>we also need to think about resetting<br>tourism so that it provides<br>meaningful and decent work in line with<br>sustainable development goal 8.<br>this is about making and promoting<br>tourism as a desirable sector to work in<br>and a first choice career not just a job<br>it can include positioning the positives<br>of tourism work<br>but also thinking about decent work that<br>recognizes the value of soft skills and<br>emotional intelligence<br>and rewards them in appropriately and<br>that leads me onto my fourth and final<br>aspect of communities as ambassadors for<br>tourism<br>this is communities as lifelong learners<br>and investing in education and training<br>as a lifelong commitment<br>i'm part of a relatively new group<br>called tourism educators form arteroa<br>and with this we're working with<br>educators across the secondary schools<br>in the<br>public and private tertiary sector to<br>work with industry and govern<br>government to challenge and change the<br>perceptions of tourism work in education<br>and to recognize the value of investing<br>in training education<br>we need to see communities value the<br>opportunities that to learn about<br>tourism and develop skills<br>that will enable new zealand to offer<br>the world-class vista experience as<br>tourism re-emerges<br>now more than ever we need that educated<br>and trained workforce to contribute and<br>lead to that post-covert tourism<br>industry<br>that'll be central to new zealand's<br>economic and social recovery<br>and it's not just about young people<br>here and businesses that need to<br>um invest all our whanau the mums the<br>dads the aunties and the uncles really<br>need to recognize the value of tourism<br>education and training<br>and support those who want to pursue a<br>worthwhile career in tourism<br>and actually this down period as chris<br>has touched on is actually a really<br>important opportunity for individuals<br>communities<br>to invest in upskilling and human<br>capital development<br>so in conclusion while many of our<br>communities already support tourism<br>we can't take this for granted and we<br>have a real opportunity<br>to think more mindfully about how we can<br>positively engage<br>our communities and harness their<br>support as domestic tourists<br>workers volunteers and learners and<br>really nurture them as tourist<br>ambassadors who can recognize the<br>opportunities that tourism can bring<br>okay thank you very much also to karen<br>um clearly there are some themes running<br>through all three<br>presentations which i think is actually<br>a real<br>a real synergy because it does connect<br>the different perspectives and the<br>different voices and obviously<br>i think a lot of the motivation comes<br>out of a similar desire to see<br>changes um so now<br>we have about 15 minutes what<br>13 minutes now to uh open for<br>for q a and before everything gets a bit<br>rushed at the end i would also<br>just like to take the opportunity to say<br>thank you to<br>ian for pulling all of this together and<br>for getting the speakers on board<br>and abby and colette who have done<br>a lot of the preparation to make these<br>webinars<br>possible and they have reached extensive<br>audiences around the world over the last<br>three months so they have really been a<br>great way<br>to connect um if any of you have in<br>wellington post covert 19<br>do pop by all right now over to the<br>questions<br>um we'll start with the first question<br>that was potu freya<br>from share knights who says thanks freya<br>how do you see this approach<br>so socializing tourism as different from<br>regenerative tourism<br>over to you freya thank you christian<br>and thank you cher for that question<br>i'm interested in regenerative tourism<br>because it moves us beyond<br>sustainability<br>but what i'm talking about is a very<br>strong<br>reorientation in tourism to not define<br>it<br>by the tourist or the tourism industry<br>but instead define it by<br>local community rights benefits and<br>interest<br>and continual opportunity<br>to give consent to things that are<br>occurring in their place<br>so regenerative tourism asked to turn<br>tourism<br>to ensuring that it improves the places<br>in which it occurs<br>but in my view it still centers tourism<br>as the priority<br>rather than saying tourism serves the<br>local community<br>so i think that what i'm saying is a<br>very strong<br>new concept and a reorientation in our<br>thank you would anyone like to um add<br>anything<br>to that although obviously it's not the<br>concept that you have proposed but<br>um in case there are any thoughts um i'm<br>happy to add them now<br>alternatively we will move on to the<br>next one which<br>comes from johan edelman from japan<br>and he i suppose asks a very similar<br>question so i would have to call on you<br>again freya to<br>defend against is this different<br>um when looking at socializing tourism i<br>can see that the ethos it carries<br>is a continuation of sustainable equal<br>responsible<br>or community-based tourism is there not<br>a risk that people will see this<br>as just a new brand of concerned tourism<br>which again might be misused<br>misappropriated<br>by tourism booster so i suppose a<br>different angle<br>not so much on the concept but how it is<br>being perceived<br>by the various audiences<br>yes thank you johan for that comment the<br>fact is the tourism industry really<br>doesn't want to<br>engage with things that change the way<br>that it makes its profits so we have to<br>be clear<br>that some of the corporate tourism<br>industries model is about<br>exploiting people and places and<br>cultures<br>to make money and that's why we have the<br>problem with over tourism in places like<br>venice<br>where there's an extractive model and<br>tourism is imposed upon communities for<br>that<br>and yet all that time they'll be using<br>the language of responsibility you know<br>the cruise ship<br>industry claims that it's one of the<br>most responsible forms of tourism<br>possible<br>which i find really astounding with what<br>i accounted before<br>so yes the tourism industry and tourism<br>supporters boosters<br>will try to co-opt any of these concepts<br>the u.n world tourism organization<br>is using the words of transformation at<br>the moment<br>but the integrity of what i'm saying is<br>a very very different way of approaching<br>things<br>the question that comes to challenge me<br>um and karen and chris can definitely<br>post<br>this um in their own work is how<br>practical is this you know i've had<br>questions about<br>exactly which communities are we talking<br>about because there are<br>factions within communities and we do<br>have things like the tourism workers<br>but i do think that the pressure that<br>we're seeing on complaints about tourism<br>are essentially the fact that<br>communities are disempowered by tourism<br>being imposed upon them<br>karen's um view of uh communities as<br>ambassadors is a beautiful example of<br>what could be done and the only place i<br>have of disagreement with karen<br>is that tourism is the priority rather<br>than the community in its interest being<br>the priority<br>so it's a difference of emphasis on our<br>views<br>wonderful now clearly you're not known<br>to disagree with anyone freya<br>but it's good to get a little bit of a<br>bit of spike in there<br>um karen would you like to respond to<br>that<br>before i would like to point out a<br>question about<br>education and workforce development<br>well i i think um i really like but<br>freya i've covered a page of notes from<br>your<br>from your presentation and i really like<br>what what you were talking there<br>um around kind of where the emphasis<br>goes and and one of the sort of the<br>words i<br>am highlighted partly because i found it<br>really hard to say is we're soft<br>right see i can't say it a reciprocal<br>relationship here<br>um and i think for me that kind of um<br>sort of sums up actually the two<br>bookends of today's<br>um today's webinar that actually that we<br>took we're both talking about the idea<br>of a relationship that is actually uh<br>beneficial for both and the emphasis is<br>in slightly different spaces<br>but in both cases it's about not<br>exploiting in either direction and i<br>think that's really kind of the big<br>change that both of us are actually uh<br>asking for perhaps demanding is that it<br>this is not a one-way relationship that<br>we actually need to look at this so<br>that's this is more<br>mutually beneficial and and that's<br>really hard because i think you're<br>completely right for air that<br>that this is not how the sector has<br>developed<br>in its huge growth period and actually<br>at the moment i think it's probably a<br>wake-up call<br>that is not that is actually really<br>valuable to have in many ways despite<br>all the<br>the challenges it's creating that it<br>actually opens up questions and debates<br>that<br>have been really hard to get to the<br>forefront and i know<br>a lot of your work you know um these are<br>not new things that that freya is<br>talking about but<br>actually what they're doing is being<br>listened to in a different way<br>because we have an opportunity to<br>rethink um<br>we think tourism and i think that we<br>really need to grasp that opportunity<br>because<br>there's only a small window i think in<br>terms of<br>um that space where we can actually<br>think so um<br>yeah thank you really much for for<br>prompting those ideas freya<br>thank you karen and freya and i would um<br>we do have a couple of other questions<br>um but i just want to throw something<br>out there<br>about what this means for us as<br>educators they will clearly be members<br>of<br>industry and general society in the<br>audience but they will also be educators<br>so um chris over to you what does that<br>mean<br>for us as educators<br>maybe standing in the classroom maybe<br>sitting in front of a computer however<br>we now engage<br>with our students so the next generation<br>thank you christian i you know it's<br>actually thinking about the<br>the the responses that we've just had<br>and and the issue about socializing<br>tourism and uh<br>freya you spoke to over tourism i i've<br>we've been involved in<br>the issue of overtourism imparter for<br>some time um<br>we don't particularly want to call it<br>overtourism we want to refer to<br>something more along the lines of a<br>a management issue with uh with tourism<br>but the reality is that<br>where we see all the issues is where we<br>reach thresholds<br>and uh thresholds of uh of community<br>um acceptance uh of tourism and of the<br>impact it has on on<br>on the on the communities it's a um<br>this term threshold is an important one<br>because it's<br>very interesting that in different uh<br>economic contexts<br>that threshold is completely different<br>uh you see a very different threshold<br>in these highlighted cases of fairness<br>and<br>barcelona and madrid than you do in<br>hanoi or beijing or<br>or bangkok where<br>there is not the same kind of social uh<br>organization or the name same kind of<br>community based organization the same<br>kind of resources available to<br>do the management you're talking about<br>so we have to be careful in the context<br>of true of educators christian that<br>we're not too<br>altruistic that we're actually quite<br>practical and realistic about<br>the fact that um jobs are jobs and<br>people need jobs<br>and uh the uh<br>we have to find this very difficult<br>balance of making sure that<br>people have incomes in these in these<br>different<br>situations there are a range of<br>different<br>ways that we can frameworks we can use<br>to educate and educate in the right way<br>one that comes to mind and it's again<br>speaks to the socializing context is<br>um is human rights as a framework in<br>which we can actually look at how<br>tourism should be developed the united<br>nations declaration on the rights of<br>indigenous people for example has<br>a remarkable framework which we do we've<br>actually utilized this in some<br>research we've done with pada we've<br>looked at human rights and<br>indigenous communities and tried to use<br>that as a framework to actually<br>make sure that the impacts on<br>communities are not<br>profound but they are respectful and so<br>on and so forth<br>so where i'm getting to with all of this<br>is that as educators<br>we've got a lot of different frameworks<br>it is our responsibility to<br>to share this to try and build the<br>critical thinking knowledge that is so<br>essential<br>to then be able to apply to all these<br>different circumstances<br>as how this how this works in each<br>different context<br>is there are always tools but the<br>fundamental is critical thinking<br>is problem solving is cognitive<br>uh deep deep learning about the<br>different issues<br>and then how do we find solutions<br>but we we can't we have to be pragmatic<br>this is an industry of jobs and it's an<br>industry of people making a living<br>and we have to be respectful of people's<br>need to make a living<br>and find out how to accomplish that for<br>everybody<br>thank you chris um did either karen or<br>freya want to respond to<br>chris's points<br>yup freya i'd love to christian um<br>i hear your words to be pragmatic and<br>i've heard this on china on<br>the debate over the war on tourism and i<br>responded to that<br>uh with an article about the war over<br>tourism as a result of it<br>and i'm concerned that in saying we need<br>jobs<br>we're not looking at the issue of the<br>fact that often in tourism we've<br>accepted the fact<br>that the jobs are poorly paid that they<br>limit people in the skills and the<br>promotion levels that they can attain<br>and that often people are forced into<br>this i found really great analysis from<br>a<br>native american scholar in the us that<br>talked about indigenous tourism as<br>a mutually arranged exploitation<br>saying that indigenous communities are<br>so desperate for<br>economic opportunities that they allow<br>tourism to exploit them and they become<br>agents in their own exploitation so<br>that's my critique of some of these<br>things<br>so i hear you but i'd really like to see<br>one of our things in our education<br>that's emphasized<br>is caring and empathy so that we'd say<br>it is not acceptable that a person<br>cannot make a living<br>off of one job in tourism and<br>hospitality<br>and that's what we tolerate in this is<br>we say that some people<br>aren't worth paying properly and<br>ensuring that they're not precarious<br>and we're not limiting the things like<br>the gig economy and the desperation<br>because with the coven pandemic what<br>we've actually seen<br>is that most of the countries around the<br>world can take care of their citizens if<br>they choose to do so<br>so we actually create these systems of<br>economies and societies<br>that are built upon exploitation and<br>then tourism takes advantage of it<br>that's my view but in agreeing with you<br>i agree totally chris with the<br>um things we need in tourism education<br>but i'd add<br>caring and empathy on top of that thank<br>you<br>if i could i i would just like to say i<br>totally agree with you on that too<br>um i think that we're at a really<br>interesting phase where we do have this<br>opportunity of a reboot<br>how do we do it better we just have to<br>also be cognizant of the fact that it's<br>um<br>there's a lot of people hurting out<br>there and we know<br>we we deal with we know those people and<br>we know their<br>their uh the changes that they're going<br>through in their in their<br>uh employment right now it's a tough<br>time so we have to be thinking about<br>you know how do we cater to how do we<br>accomplish a reboot possibly in a better<br>way and when we ask about what we can do<br>as educators we've got frameworks to do<br>this<br>but we also have to build those skill<br>sets so people can excel and that and<br>that environment is shifting<br>and that was the point i was trying to<br>make in my presentation<br>so it's an interesting and challenging<br>time for all of us<br>um thank you very much um there are some<br>other interesting questions that i would<br>encourage the speakers to look at<br>and unfortunately we are i'm out of time<br>but just because doug pierce is in the<br>audience<br>there's a question for you chris is<br>there a future for tour coach drivers<br>uh i'm sorry i didn't hear the last<br>piece of christian but i did hear about<br>the two of coach drivers well doug<br>i i think you have to ask that question<br>yourself was there a future for tour<br>coach drivers<br>um i don't i hopefully there was<br>um and uh i think<br>in reality that's changing though so<br>i don't know the answer to that one but<br>uh i hope there are more in the future<br>thanks doug thanks i think we might have<br>vr headset operators in the future who<br>can do a similar job<br>it's a bit of a cheeky suggestion um<br>thank you very much to all three<br>speakers uh it's been wonderful to<br>have this opportunity to continue the<br>conversation that we started back in<br>june when it feels like the world was a<br>different place and we were still<br>talking about the first waves and not<br>the second waves and maybe the third<br>waves<br>so clearly this thing is going to hang<br>around for longer than anticipated<br>um all these wonderful thoughts are much<br>appreciated<br>i would like to say thank you to freya<br>chris<br>and karen and also to all those who<br>posted questions<br>as usual we will summarize um the<br>questions and the video recording of the<br>seminar will be made available<br>via the website so thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
