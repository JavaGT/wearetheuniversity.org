In a world looking for evidence based policy driven decisions, data loggers (sensors) are making it easier to monitor the IEQ of buildings.<br>Using the New Zealand Ministry of Education property portfolio as a case study, measuring IEQ at scale (in many buildings) will require deploying a minimum of one multi-variable environmental sensor (IoT devices) in each space.<br><br>Managing the big data retrieved from these sensors and interpreting it in a way that makes sense (visualised and reported) and representative of the IEQ performance of an entire space has proven challenging.<br><br>This talk presents a methodological approach for assessing IEQ at an unprecedented scale to diagnosis building performance (triage good and poor buildings) for early discrimination from hundreds or more sensors to inform on the prioritisation of remediation works, design, asset management, maintenance and evidence-based policy decisions.<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thanks very much rebecca and welcome and<br>warm greetings to everyone who is<br>joining us here in new zealand<br>and across the globe my name is annabeth<br>abassi ackley<br>i hold a master's degree in sustainable<br>architecture<br>from the university of portsmouth in the<br>united kingdom<br>in the last three plus years i have been<br>carrying out a doctoral degree in<br>architecture at the victoria university<br>of wellington<br>from my research and using real life<br>projects<br>i am going to discuss in this seminar<br>the measurement of<br>ieq at scale in a large property<br>portfolio there is clear evidence<br>that with poor ieq conditions there is a<br>decrease in human performance<br>and the acceptability of the indoor<br>environment<br>research has shown that while there are<br>many variables<br>that impact on the comfort the health<br>and well-being of students in schools<br>lighting performance thermal performance<br>acoustic performance and indoor air<br>quality are the four leading<br>environmental variables that do not only<br>define the quality of the<br>indoor environment was significantly has<br>an effect on students health<br>and learning performance when we<br>calculate the time a child spends in a<br>classroom<br>it is about 15 percent of their working<br>lives<br>these has attracted teachers parents<br>policy makers you and i to be interested<br>in the monitoring of these variables in<br>schools<br>to understand the combined influence on<br>learning performance<br>and to guide proactive asset management<br>and investment<br>decisions in a world looking for<br>evidence-based data policy decisions<br>data loggers are making it easier to<br>monitor iq of buildings<br>in the past we usually have individual<br>data loggers for co2 measurement for<br>temperature measurements<br>but in recent years there is an emerging<br>technology<br>of combining these individual data<br>loggers<br>into a single sensor to simultaneously<br>measure<br>all the ieq variables together<br>these type of data loggers may likely be<br>cost effective<br>and will minimize the use of these<br>individual data loggers<br>for example in new zealand the ministry<br>of education<br>have at least one of these multivariable<br>sensors<br>in about 90 selected schools across the<br>country<br>the aim is to understand the indoor<br>condition of new zealand schools to<br>inform proactive asset management<br>decisions<br>if this is to be a nationwide tool<br>collecting thousands of environmental<br>data<br>and considering that each ieq variable<br>like the daylight variable<br>or the co2 or even the thermal<br>environment can vary<br>in a classroom this informed the<br>rationale to research into ieq<br>measurement strategy<br>to find answers to questions such as<br>where what and how to measure<br>ieq in a national property portfolio<br>i began researching these questions by<br>carrying out a literature review<br>of over 300 related ieq papers<br>the table shows a selection of<br>studies that measure thermal environment<br>and carbon dioxide<br>measurement in schools we can see the<br>number of sensors<br>and the measurement height of the<br>sensors while there appear to be some<br>agreement with the carbon dioxide<br>studies of the use of a one point sensor<br>there is a variance in the thermal<br>measurement studies<br>and this was consistent with the<br>lighting variable as well as<br>the sound level variable<br>in the height of sensors we see that the<br>various researchers<br>have used different heights from 0.6<br>meters to<br>up to about 2 meters these<br>indicate the variance in the number of<br>sensors<br>used for ieq measurement and the<br>different measurement height either on<br>the wall or at the center of the space<br>in all data collection projects the<br>location of a sensor<br>is often the most important criteria for<br>obtaining<br>reliable and useful data for example<br>the lighting expat usually measures<br>desktop illuminance<br>but in any occupied classroom it could<br>be practically impossible<br>to put multiple sensors to measure ieq<br>variables<br>because of the various activities of<br>students and teachers<br>within the space therefore the<br>use of a one point sensor will suffice<br>i proceeded to look at the relative<br>importance of<br>each ieq variable and found these many<br>references<br>that looked into the four iq variables<br>in different settings using a scale of<br>0.1 to 0.5<br>the bar chart shows how important each<br>of these ieq variable is<br>relative to the order the aim was to<br>ascertain<br>whether there is a consensus among<br>researchers in<br>offices that differs from that in<br>schools<br>the red boxes shows that there seem to<br>be a little consensus<br>that thermal performance is important<br>but not convincing to say it is the most<br>important variable the overall trends<br>indicate that there is no consensus<br>of on the importance of each ieq<br>variable<br>relative to the other factors so<br>i proceeded to explore where will be the<br>best place to locate<br>a one point data logger in the classroom<br>and how will the amount enormous amount<br>of data<br>be analyzed due to time constraints<br>i will briefly discuss the insight of<br>only the lighting findings<br>and a high level summary of the order<br>variables<br>i modeled a two-sided classroom<br>and a one-sided lit space where i put an<br>array of sensors<br>on the horizontal plane at a height of<br>0.8 meters this is about 24 cents<br>sensor points and a one point sensor the<br>green<br>cycle on the long wall and on the short<br>walls<br>i carried out a climate-based daylight<br>modeling<br>of the whole year to a certain whether a<br>one-point sensor on the wall<br>could be representative of the daylight<br>quantity<br>and quality across the whole space<br>the tiny illuminance graphs<br>shows the green boxes shows the<br>illuminance button<br>on the long wall illuminance pattern on<br>the short wall<br>and the red boxes shows illuminance<br>pattern across<br>each of those different spaces on the<br>horizontal plane<br>the interesting trend here is that there<br>is<br>a variation if we look at the luminance<br>pattern of sensor<br>f2 in comparison to other illuminance<br>points<br>we see generally that there is a<br>variation<br>in the daylight levels across<br>the space but one interesting trend i<br>found<br>was that the illuminance pattern on the<br>sensor on the long wall<br>has a relationship with the illuminance<br>pattern<br>of the lighting levels across the center<br>of the horizontal plane<br>these strengths and pattern was<br>consistent in the two-sided classroom<br>and in the one-sided class classroom<br>where the illuminance pattern of the<br>sensor in the long wall<br>and of the short wall had a relationship<br>with the lighting levels across the<br>center of the horizontal plane<br>i went for them to investigate these<br>trends<br>using three experimental classrooms with<br>different<br>orientations with different space<br>occupancy<br>and you and usage in three different<br>schools<br>and i carried out physical measurements<br>using a single point sensor<br>the red sensor is the sensor at the<br>center of the space<br>and the b sensors are the sensors on the<br>wall<br>i found that approximately<br>90 percent of the variation in the<br>horizontal plane sides of the red sensor<br>can be accounted for by the variation<br>in the vertical sensors on the wall<br>which corresponds to the result of the<br>simulation modeling<br>i have just shown in the previous slide<br>i applied<br>the same approach to temperature levels<br>relative humidity levels sound levels<br>and co2<br>and the findings indicated that<br>measuring<br>ieq at a single location or height<br>may not be an accurate indicator<br>or a true representation of the<br>environmental conditions<br>across a whole space this was due to the<br>factors of variability<br>such as the configuration of the window<br>the movement and intensity of the sun<br>at a point in time and occupant activity<br>and space usage but<br>the overall findings indicated that a<br>one point sensor<br>strategically located at the center of<br>an unglazed vertical wall<br>at a height of 1.5 meters where the sun<br>is unlikely to shine and away from any<br>sources of heat<br>could provide a useful benchmark to<br>predict the ieq performance<br>of the most frequently occupied parts of<br>a classroom<br>provided these factors of<br>ieq variability are taken into account<br>the use of a one point sensor gives a<br>general indication<br>of ieq trends and patterns it can<br>suggest<br>that ieq highs are way too high or the<br>lows<br>are way too low or the extremes are too<br>broad<br>it cannot pinpoint problem causes or<br>specific<br>local issues but it is useful<br>to trash good and poor classrooms for<br>early discrimination<br>from hundreds of sensors of how to<br>direct<br>the maintenance and the refurbishment<br>programs<br>for large groups of school buildings<br>an additional level of information could<br>be picked up better<br>by using multiple sensors building<br>modeling that just as i've illustrated<br>in the previous slide<br>or in combination with other qualitative<br>methods such as survey of cocoa pumps<br>especially for large open plant spaces<br>it is one thing to deploy an<br>environmental sensor<br>into a space to collect data and it is<br>another thing<br>to be able to make sense of the big data<br>that has been<br>collected so i proceeded<br>to develop a logical a simple and an<br>insightful method to easily analyze<br>this model is developed based on three<br>steps of data analysis the first step is<br>the ieq scale<br>which uses a scale of one is to five<br>with<br>green the amber and red and the<br>analytical framework i have used here<br>shows how<br>i translate various ieq variables into<br>scores of 1<br>being good and 5 of 1 being poor and<br>five being very good<br>and this scale is based on the degree<br>to which empirical studies in the<br>literature predicted<br>the factor in a classroom that would<br>support<br>learning performance a common problem<br>with combined indices like this is that<br>it is possible for very poor factors<br>to be easily hidden by other factors<br>when<br>aggregated to a single number so<br>i created a second analytical step<br>which um is useful to red flag<br>the individual ieq variable that has a<br>poor rating<br>and also to graphically represent<br>the combined iq model using a spider<br>plot<br>to effectively apply steps one and two<br>i went further to create a third<br>analytical step<br>which has a four-phase iq<br>prioritization category with<br>recommendations<br>to take actions using the analytical<br>framework discourse so far<br>and working with two developers i have<br>built<br>a proof of concept of an ieq<br>intelligence building application<br>my initiative imagines a building<br>industry<br>that is empowered by access to real-time<br>building performance data<br>that is based on well-defined and<br>scientific and practical models very<br>briefly<br>i will take you through the dashboard<br>of the application the dashboard<br>i have got four major menus<br>the first menu is the deployment if for<br>example a project manager or<br>an individual goes on a school site to<br>install a data logger<br>you will need to key in the informations<br>of the school<br>the building id the room id the sensor<br>id<br>the date and it's going to automatically<br>give you a summary of how many sensors<br>are active<br>or how many are inactive the next is the<br>surveymen which has what i call<br>the occupant iq assessment tool this<br>is will be given to the school and with<br>to fill out for each of the buildings<br>which has a predefined uh questions<br>of for example rating the overall<br>facilities in the classroom<br>also has questions for each of the ieq<br>variables like lighting thermal comfort<br>noise and indoor air quality the next<br>level of data is<br>information about the institution you<br>could add<br>informations about the institutions such<br>as the school role the block number<br>and the institution number the next<br>level<br>is the building information where you<br>could add<br>informations about the year the<br>buildings were built the<br>the die the dimensions of the buildings<br>and most<br>okay we are not seeing the screen you<br>can see that you are sharing<br>yes okay sorry i will just<br>again can wondering if you can see the<br>can can you see the screen now no<br>no okay i'll just stop sharing and<br>reshare again<br>okay i'm resharing can you see the<br>screen now<br>yes you can see the screen now<br>okay so i was referring to the<br>deployment menu<br>that has a summary of all the active<br>sensors and inactive sensors<br>and the next level of data is the<br>occupant assessment tool<br>which has the informations about the<br>lighting quality<br>the thermal quality and all the other<br>environmental variables<br>the next level of information is the<br>institution data<br>where you could add informations about<br>the institution<br>and information about the bill the<br>the the building where for example you<br>have informations about the roof type<br>the gliding type<br>and all of this most large um<br>organizations may already have these<br>informations in their<br>assets register and it will just be to<br>pre<br>populate them prior to um going to the<br>school site to install<br>a sensor the relevance of all these data<br>is<br>to make sense of the ieq data<br>in terms of the trends and pattern the<br>context of the building<br>the way the occupants use the building<br>needs to be taken into record to be able<br>to make sense of the data<br>i will come to the room information<br>it's possible to add informations about<br>the orientation of the building<br>and the glazing element and<br>the observations of the things that have<br>been found on the space for example if<br>you want to add an observation<br>based on my research for lighting i've<br>already pre-populated the possible<br>things that<br>could be found on the school site where<br>we could say um the<br>classroom the students were using blinds<br>for a screen activity<br>for acoustics i've already pre<br>pre-populated some information that may<br>be<br>required and then you can click save<br>under actions you could also add the<br>floor plan you could add 3d<br>images and this is where i hope to<br>install the functionality of bim the<br>building<br>information modeling tools which will<br>help to provide more context about the<br>building<br>and we proceed to visualization under<br>visualization<br>you could add a sensor which has been<br>populated<br>tracked to the school name the building<br>name the sensor id<br>if you've got a json file or an excel<br>file you could browse in here<br>and you could load it to view the data<br>or if you've got an<br>api you could put the link here and you<br>could track the data<br>and we moved to visualization for in<br>visualization you've also got the<br>characteristics of the different spaces<br>and then we could click on the school<br>for example have pre-populated for the<br>bob light school<br>having the building name the room name<br>you could view individual ieq<br>variables in this instance let's view<br>all the variables<br>and we could click visualize it's just<br>going to take about<br>ten to five seconds for us to see a<br>visualization of the data<br>and boom here we go and on that for<br>example<br>under the lighting data the the<br>framework i have used is a light levels<br>of<br>300 to 2000 lux which sits in the scale<br>of four or five<br>and anything out of that out of these<br>zones may be either in the scale of one<br>or two<br>same applies for other scales i've used<br>for sound for relative humidity for<br>for temperature and we see the radar<br>chart showing the combined iq rating<br>for example if a property uh ceo has<br>2 000 build buildings they may want to<br>know to have a report for each of the<br>buildings that has been<br>monitored all you need to do is to click<br>on generate<br>a report and it's going to populate the<br>information of the school<br>information of the building an executive<br>summary which is going to be a detailed<br>text<br>using the framework i have created of a<br>scale of one is to five<br>depending on the trends and patterns in<br>the graph you could edit this to see if<br>the building is sitting on scale one or<br>on scale five<br>and the images of the floor plan that<br>has been added will up would appear<br>and the line graphs for all the<br>different ieq<br>performance rating for lighting for<br>acoustics<br>for indoor air quality and the summary<br>will appear and recommendation in this<br>instance is sitting on a sweet spot of<br>four<br>and five so no further action is<br>required a ceo will also want to know<br>what is the overall report for i have 2<br>000 buildings<br>which of them falls under a<br>a category of buildings where um the<br>lighting is poor or it is good<br>so these will now pop up to show the<br>individual<br>variables for the 2000 set of monitored<br>build<br>buildings that are either poor lighting<br>or good<br>lighting and will help for them to make<br>an investment<br>this decision the next level is the<br>category<br>a category of building in either in<br>skill one or two<br>will be of a high priority and the<br>recommendation will be further<br>assessment<br>or investment may be re re<br>required the next category will be one<br>and two for the individual variable that<br>has a poor rating<br>same recommendations and then for<br>categories of buildings in skill three<br>four and five no further action<br>so with this high level summary report a<br>ceo will know where to invest or where<br>to put in their funds<br>to be able to say we want to lift the<br>buildings that are in<br>category one to category three or four<br>i will just go back to the powerpoint<br>slide and you let me know if you can see<br>can you see the powerpoint slide you<br>have to click out of it<br>and then click back into the powerpoint<br>okay<br>so the powerpoint slide can you see it<br>now<br>yep so i do want to stress that<br>the ieq app is a work in progress<br>some of the interpretations may change<br>and as we get more evidence-based data<br>the analytical framework i have<br>developed may improve<br>but what i have presented is a proof of<br>concept<br>that it is possible to measure ieq at<br>scale in a large property portfolio<br>and that there is a scientific mechanism<br>to<br>easily analyze and report ieq big data<br>in a way that makes sense<br>i thought um that<br>that is a really good message to share<br>with you<br>given the potential of this app i am<br>open to discussions with individuals<br>individuals that organizations who might<br>be interested in the work that we are<br>doing<br>these are my contact details please get<br>in touch<br>for an offline conversation that may<br>likely facilitate<br>the development of this very fascinating<br>iq building<br>intelligence application what i can<br>promise is that we will have an<br>application that has a robust<br>user-friendly interface that will<br>collect real-time data<br>and it will provide evidence-based data<br>to inform policy<br>and investment decisions suited for use<br>by organizations with a large<br>property portfolio it's time for me to<br>finish<br>and to acknowledge the people who have<br>contributed to the series of experiments<br>underlying this research permits me to<br>acknowledge the contributions of my<br>supervisors professor<br>michael dunn and dr jeff thomas i want<br>to also thank the ministry of education<br>for providing the data loggers<br>that we use for my experiment and also<br>to thank professor louise turkey of the<br>school of education<br>for her contributions i see that<br>my parents have zoomed in i want to<br>thank them for their support<br>and i want to acknowledge everyone from<br>the other side of the world<br>who have stayed late into the night to<br>join this seminar thank you to everyone<br>for<br>listening<br>thank you for that really fantastic work<br>good job<br>yes thank you eckley and um<br>thank you everyone for for joining the<br>conversation<br>um and it's great to see we've got<br>people from the other side of the world<br>on<br>on zoom that's the value of the um if<br>anyone had any uh<br>questions we've got a few minutes<br>yeah um sure go for it<br>yeah um my name here is um from madison<br>university um thank you actually for<br>your presentation<br>sorry about the background noise i'm um<br>i'm in the road please<br>um i've got one question for ugly which<br>is more or less like a future thoughts<br>your app is mainly based on the indoor<br>environment quality<br>that you've looked at the four main<br>aspects of individual quality that's<br>temperature and so on<br>do you have do you um fbch your app<br>um including other aspects of the<br>environment like the social aspect or<br>um yeah like um<br>things like and distractions<br>interactions and so on other things that<br>that could affect students<br>in in the classroom and<br>that is one question and also um can you<br>obvious<br>handed or extended to include other<br>buildings there are no schools like<br>office building or<br>hospitals and so on yep thanks very much<br>dr<br>eziaku for that very interesting<br>question<br>um the app is actually the first<br>attempt to build um a<br>application that has a robust<br>ability to analyze many ieq<br>variables as one as regards other things<br>such as um<br>occupancy or how the space is being used<br>that is being<br>put into the air the aspect of the app i<br>called<br>observation note where if someone goes<br>to a school site to put<br>a sensor and they could take note of<br>some of the things that they have<br>found on site and also the form where<br>would be given to the schools or to the<br>users of the buildings<br>to feel about how they use their<br>buildings and the different trends<br>all of that is to be used to make sense<br>of the<br>data but as we develop this folder<br>we are very open to add more um<br>things into the app and then for the<br>the question about the app the app is<br>not just for schools i've only used<br>schools as a case listing<br>case study in india so<br>we can tweak it to be able to fit into<br>any organization that<br>let's say is trying to look at<br>residential homes we can also tweak it<br>for<br>other organizations that are looking at<br>let's say health<br>buildings and the rest so basically the<br>analytical framework i have developed<br>has been done in a system systematic way<br>that could<br>actually be adjusted to fit any type of<br>setting<br>i don't know if that answers your<br>yes he does thank you very much i i<br>think we'll have an offline<br>conversation because this fits perfectly<br>um to some aspect of the work i'm<br>currently working on<br>and yeah so you'll be good that we<br>collaborate somehow and see what we can<br>get out of your research thank you very<br>much thanks yeah it sounds very much dr<br>ezekie<br>i got one oh yeah actually i was<br>wondering whether um whether you're<br>in your work with you you've been able<br>to connect the<br>indoor environmental quality aspects to<br>the actual learning outcomes of those<br>students in those classrooms that you<br>looked at<br>thanks very much prof um when i set out<br>to begin this<br>re this research the aim was to look out<br>for the combined<br>effect of each of those environmental<br>qualities with um the learning<br>of how of our students learning spaces<br>but what i found was that<br>there is no metrics to look into the<br>combined influence of these variables to<br>now do a<br>comparison with um achievement records<br>so these now moved my view in terms of<br>the app<br>and the framework i am building trying<br>to build a methodological<br>approach where we could monitor and use<br>evidence-based data to look at the<br>combined influence of ieq in schools<br>where we can now relate that into the<br>learning<br>assessment data so the next line of<br>things i will<br>that will follow will be when we have<br>been able to use this<br>metrics to actually um analyze all those<br>environmental variables as one then we<br>can now use that to compare to<br>achievement data to find and the<br>combined influence of ieg<br>thank you and if i could comment<br>actually um<br>the the issue is around me around<br>measuring<br>student performance is around consent<br>particularly<br>informed consent uh in a highly<br>federated model each<br>each school in new zealand is<br>effectively its own<br>agent um agency so<br>coordinating that informed consent<br>okay any any final and a final question<br>tasmania um i didn't join<br>the beginning of the discussion but i<br>was just wondering<br>uh how this uh<br>research can be looked into<br>real time climatic data<br>from the um maybe<br>the the the closest yeah<br>meteorological uh station yeah<br>so that i think it will help<br>this kind of research to to getting<br>real-time data<br>so have you considered that or you uh<br>taking you are only relying on how<br>they they they met data that<br>were measured in the in this in a<br>particular station<br>and are you looking at how you are<br>calibrating that with<br>what the real-time climatic data from<br>the weather station<br>is saying thanks very very much um<br>that's a very great<br>great one so in the experiment i did we<br>didn't just put the sensors<br>in inside the classrooms we also put<br>some sensors<br>up outside because we have an<br>understanding that the<br>external variation in the weather could<br>also have an<br>effect on what is happening in<br>inside the classroom so we also put the<br>sensors<br>outside to track the whole data from the<br>outside and also from the inside<br>and also we also um got some data from<br>the neva which is the weather station<br>here and we also<br>analyze that in comparison with the<br>sensors we had outside and the inside<br>so for the app we will work on a<br>functionality<br>that can track um the external weather<br>data from source and also so there's<br>always<br>we can talk about that there's always a<br>way to<br>extract uh to extract and<br>impute such that kind of data into what<br>we are using in our<br>timer simulation so we can incorporate<br>such into<br>your research thank you yeah thanks<br>thanks thanks very much<br>thank you very much again um for your<br>talk acne<br>and um and if people could give them a<br>a virtual clinic that would be fantastic<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
