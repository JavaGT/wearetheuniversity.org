Therefore, a holistic approach to the resources, values and change processes of the landscape has become an increasingly important issue. Understanding the landscape as an arena is an important basis and starting point for both long term strategic planning and in continuing spatial planning. Drawing from the Swedish experience over the last seven years, this lecture will discuss an interdisciplinarity methodology by providing a toolkit to obtain a holistic understanding of the dynamics of the landscape. This methodology is now used in big and costly pending infrastructure projects such as high-speed railways in Sweden. Emily will describe a method for Integrated Landscape Character Assessment that can be used in long term planning.<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um warm greetings<br>everyone who is joining us um not only<br>here in new zealand but<br>across the globe and it is a pleasure to<br>welcome you to<br>our lecture of emily white as part of<br>our<br>thinkers in doers lecture series for<br>those that don't know me my name is<br>bruno marquez<br>and i am the program director for the<br>landscape architecture<br>degree at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>so the thinkers endure selection series<br>aims at<br>bringing together practitioners<br>academics and students that are<br>interested in a topic and and<br>the discipline of landscape architecture<br>in order to share ideas and to hear the<br>best<br>uh and the lightest innovations in the<br>fields<br>so this initiative is between the new<br>zealand<br>institute of landscape architects our<br>wellington branch<br>and victoria university of wellington<br>our eighth speaker emily white is a<br>landscape<br>architect practicing in sweden and she<br>is a partner<br>at the office of once cup sluggett<br>sorry emily if i mispronounced it<br>in stockholm um working with landscape<br>architecture landscape and urban<br>planning<br>and since 2010 she is the co-author<br>of several guidelines connected to<br>planning of landscapes in public open<br>space<br>she has an international outlook through<br>engagements at the international<br>federation of landscape architects and<br>she's<br>also teaching at the swedish university<br>of agricultural sciences<br>slu her lecture is titled<br>integrated landscape character<br>assessment a toolkit for long-term<br>special planning<br>and looks at sustainable transport<br>systems and the considerable<br>impact on the landscape as a result<br>of the building and management of roads<br>and railways<br>therefore a holistic approach to<br>resources<br>values and change processes of the<br>landscape has become an increasingly<br>important issue<br>understanding the landscape as an arena<br>is an important basis and starting point<br>for both<br>long-term strategic planning and in<br>continuing special planning<br>so drawing drawing from her swedish<br>experience over the last years<br>and this lecture will discuss an<br>interdisciplinary methodology<br>by providing a toolkit to obtain a<br>holistic understanding<br>of the dynamics of the landscape such<br>toolkit has been widely implemented in<br>sweden especially in high-speed railway<br>systems<br>and emily will be describing the methods<br>that can be used in long-term planning<br>just some very briefly housekeeping<br>rules and don't forget that emily will<br>be sharing her screen<br>so don't forget to keep this window open<br>so you can actually see the slides<br>and also please remind me to try to talk<br>just minimize any background noise and<br>at the end there will be<br>an opportunity for questions you can<br>either ask them verbally or you can<br>write them in the chat box<br>so without further ado please join me in<br>welcoming<br>emily all the way from sweden<br>thank you very much um<br>okay so bruno what i'd like to do is to<br>share my screen<br>but i wonder i'm not that accustomed to<br>zoom<br>yes good okay so here i am i'm emily<br>i'm calling you from stockholm<br>which is sort of on the other side of<br>the world from wellington<br>which is very nice so that means i've<br>just said good night to my children<br>and uh it's a bit later than usual<br>that i spend time at the computer<br>actually<br>but it's very very nice that you invited<br>me i appreciate this very much and i've<br>i've also been very curious at this<br>series that you<br>this initiative of thinkers and doers<br>which is really<br>made available also to a lot of people<br>who are<br>uh aware of that this is happening so i<br>thought<br>i'd um i'd start off by<br>sharing my my other screen uh<br>to introduce you to the topic<br>yes so let me just confirm<br>that you are seeing my screen<br>yeah it's working perfectly well good<br>and are you also seeing um a bar with<br>different faces on the right yeah<br>yeah should i move that somewhere no<br>that's fine just keep it like that okay<br>okay<br>i'll just uh this is just kind of<br>starting up the starting up<br>part good okay<br>so um i was invited here to<br>talk to you about something that i've<br>engaged myself in for some years now<br>a method called integrated landscape<br>character assessment<br>and<br>to start off i thought just to fill in<br>some of the details that bruno started<br>with<br>um this is my office<br>well one day at the office uh<br>we don't always work like this but we<br>are an office<br>of landscape architects and urban<br>planners that have really<br>uh started to take initiatives to<br>um make things happen in the public<br>space where we where we are<br>so uh the 40 there's 40 employees<br>and there's a lot of engagement from the<br>different<br>specialities within the office that<br>leads to this kind of<br>happy interaction with other local uh<br>people<br>in the city so this is just just to show<br>that<br>uh the vicinity of my office really<br>um i thought i thought i might start off<br>by introducing<br>i think in a way it's fascinating<br>because<br>scandinavia which includes sweden has a<br>lot of similarities<br>to new zealand if you<br>talk about sweden this<br>is kind of a very<br>wide broad image of what we do in sweden<br>as you see on the right a lot of sweden<br>is covered with forests<br>it's 69 so you can imagine<br>that the forest industry is also a very<br>important part<br>of sweden's economy<br>eight percent consists of arable land<br>which is also very concentrated to the<br>southern parts of sweden<br>so most of these 69 forests appear<br>in the north and the eight percents<br>appear in the south<br>and only three percent percent of<br>the whole area of sweden is uh<br>considered to be<br>areas which are settled with the urban<br>urban areas and<br>where where i come from where i live<br>here in the stockholm<br>area i guess we have<br>a climate which is a cousin of the<br>southern island<br>of new zealand we also have a temperate<br>broadleaf<br>forest yet we don't have any rainforests<br>where i am<br>and the the pine trees have kind of been<br>they're more mixed with other forests as<br>well<br>we have a bedrock which is extremely old<br>so the image you see here is<br>you could say new zealand in a few<br>billion years time<br>it's all worn down it's cracked it's<br>shaped by uh really the the turns of the<br>time<br>so this means that uh the structure of<br>the landscape has<br>a lot of a lot of layers uh it has big<br>structures like<br>faults it has big structures coming from<br>the ice age like eska's<br>uh yes but you know what as escazar<br>the whole country is kind of draped with<br>moraine<br>and in the arable areas there's clay and<br>sand<br>and the city of stockholm of course as<br>every city has been placed in a very<br>strategic location<br>this was where two big water bodies met<br>it was the baltic sea uh which is<br>connected<br>to uh sorry there's a bit of night<br>flying animals here<br>uh it was connected to well you know<br>russia finland<br>poland germany and on the other side we<br>have the<br>the great lake of mayer ladam<br>so this means it's an very interesting<br>spot<br>where a lot of things happens and<br>there's a mosaic<br>of all these different nature types of<br>water forest<br>arable land and this means that it's<br>been inhabited<br>and the power the center of power for<br>about<br>thousand years now<br>this time as we're speaking this is the<br>most densely populated area<br>in sweden and uh<br>it's still it's it's not in the middle<br>of sweden<br>what i thought i would introduce you to<br>today<br>is a project which was<br>initiated by the swedish transport<br>administration<br>someone at this administration quoted<br>this<br>the swedish transport administration is<br>creating the largest landscape<br>transformation<br>since the ice age okay so then<br>you understand the the scope of<br>uh of of this organization or maybe it's<br>the image of its its own uh role and<br>persona<br>and to just get this into kind of<br>monetary terms uh i thought i'd<br>translate it to something which could be<br>called<br>national investment plan in roads and<br>rail we have<br>a 10-year plan which<br>is decided by the parliament<br>and the last one that was decided uh<br>added up to uh well it's<br>622 billion swedish crowns which<br>it's it's about the equivalent of 110<br>billion new zealand dollars<br>or 66 billion euros so<br>at least in swedish terms this is a lot<br>of money<br>really a lot of money and at the same<br>time<br>we have these huge challenges that are<br>coming on<br>that we realize that we need to<br>prepare for climate change we don't need<br>to prepare we are preparing we're doing<br>it right now<br>and we we have a desperate need to<br>strengthen biodiversity<br>so you have this incredible<br>development where there's a lot of<br>urbanization a lot of need to build new<br>infrastructure<br>and at the same time we're finding a<br>self<br>understanding we need to make way for<br>for the resilience of the the changing<br>landscape<br>um so the<br>um transport administration<br>uh they presented this plan of six to<br>six billion uh<br>six yeah a euro and um<br>the government gave them uh homework<br>they said okay very good we<br>we appreciate all these investments<br>but how are you affecting the<br>environment<br>how are you infecting how are you<br>affecting the landscape<br>a proper demonstration of this<br>and so the transport administration they<br>decided<br>okay maybe maybe it's because we're<br>doing it the wrong way maybe we<br>we're asking the wrong questions<br>and i thought i'd show you this image<br>because today in sweden a lot of<br>planning goes on<br>in the left<br>the corner in the left down<br>down here we have within the national<br>spatial planning which also includes<br>planning for<br>for road and rail uh we have very<br>specialist<br>uh planning we have planning for a<br>natural recreation areas we have<br>planning for infrastructure for energy<br>for biodiversity for cultural heritage<br>it's all kind of specialized and i think<br>this picture actually is not just unique<br>for sweden<br>but we've we've achieved a great<br>specialization within<br>a lot of developed countries so<br>when we apply a new measure like<br>a new high-speed railway or a road<br>uh our legislation is<br>uh focused on avoiding<br>uh too much damage and avoiding<br>uh to mitigate or to<br>uh not sort of<br>create too much problems for each of<br>these sectors<br>so this is a problem in itself that you<br>are you're starting with a negative<br>starting point that you're going to<br>inflict damage<br>and that it's a very diverse and<br>divided sectors so<br>one of the kind of main aims in this<br>project that<br>i participated in was to change<br>this perspective from not<br>not damaging but to see is there<br>potential<br>to instead have a sustainable<br>development could we plan in a different<br>way<br>could we interact in a different way<br>could we collaborate<br>to find new solutions and this went also<br>very well with<br>uh the european landscape convention<br>which is a convention that we've<br>rectified in sweden we have many<br>countries in europe which<br>leads lives by the european landscape<br>convention<br>um and uh if we<br>if we look at the planning the planning<br>um<br>outcome or the planning situation<br>without the elc the european landscape<br>convention it's a lot about this<br>if we see this base plate as the<br>landscape<br>and we have a measure we already know<br>there are some areas which may be<br>designated for example<br>which have been described valued<br>within these different sectors so when<br>there's a lot of different<br>new investments being made like<br>maintenance new investments<br>trimming blah blah blah if we only look<br>at if these affect the areas which are<br>already designated we will only get<br>a certain type of answer so<br>in this change of perspective we need to<br>build an understanding that will give us<br>answers between the designated areas<br>so we need a holistic understanding of<br>the landscape<br>and that means that we need to work more<br>interdisciplinary<br>to find what is the landscape what does<br>it consist of<br>and the kind of challenge in this of<br>course<br>is that if you look at a timeline<br>where we in sweden have strategic<br>planning<br>preliminary studies you evaluate and<br>then eventually you<br>land in construction and design it's at<br>the stage of the strategic planning<br>you know you often know very little<br>of the landscape but in fact<br>your ability or possibility to<br>influence what's going to happen is<br>actually the greatest<br>a process here which is actually counter<br>working in in two different directions<br>so<br>one of the aims of this um the the<br>project or the method that i will also<br>get back to in a little while here is to<br>try and expand this knowledge about the<br>landscape<br>early in the planning early in the<br>spatial planning so when the next<br>investment plan of x million<br>crowns comes at is laid at the table<br>we can at least say something about what<br>implications they will have about the<br>landscape but that means we also need to<br>find knowledge about the landscape<br>earlier on in the process so there was<br>this<br>identified need to find a method that<br>could help us<br>find this kind of knowledge on a very<br>large scale<br>context very early in the planning<br>strategic planning<br>and still have a holistic approach<br>so i guess most of you who are listening<br>to this<br>talk today you are probably well<br>acquainted with landscape<br>but when i have lectures both for<br>my students but also for professionals<br>within the transport administrations<br>that are not landscape architects<br>i usually start off by<br>just briefly talking about what the<br>landscape is<br>and i think this image that's been<br>produced by val kirby<br>from natural england gives a very good<br>kind of<br>overview that if we want to talk about<br>landscape<br>we need to know different things about<br>the landscape<br>we need to know about the landscape form<br>we need about<br>no we need to know about the ecosystem<br>that goes on on the surface<br>we need to know about the land use we<br>need to know about the time depth<br>and we also need to acknowledge the<br>experience or relationship that people<br>has<br>to the landscape and all of this of<br>course goes very well<br>with the european landscape commission<br>vention<br>so the land the european landscape<br>convention<br>it states that man is a part of the<br>landscape<br>and the landscape is part of man that<br>man creates his history and landscape<br>and landscape its history shapes man<br>so basically it's it's a very democratic<br>um convention<br>it means that we're all responsible<br>but we're also all we all have the right<br>to influence our common environment<br>but even if this is the convention<br>we take the landscape for granted<br>and we don't acknowledge all these<br>different aspects of what a landscape is<br>and that it belongs to everyone and when<br>we then<br>plan infrastructure<br>it often ends up like this and it<br>doesn't have to look like this<br>this is not making anyone happy besides<br>maybe the railway people who<br>uh work with maintenance at this<br>specific stretch so<br>if we not if we are taking the landscape<br>for granted and not<br>acknowledging all the layers and all the<br>knowledge that we need<br>it just ends up like this and eventually<br>we will have a landscape which is<br>very ugly very fragmented<br>all kinds of bad things are going to<br>happen<br>so uh this image is kind of<br>showing you the the vision of this<br>integrated landscape assessment method<br>you could say that it consists<br>of different building blocks<br>that by putting these building blocks<br>together<br>you acquire this knowledge that you need<br>to be able to make wise decisions on<br>on how the landscape is affected so if i<br>very<br>sort of briefly tell you what this means<br>it's<br>that we need to describe the landscape<br>as a whole<br>and a good method of doing that is to<br>use the landscape character assessment<br>as a method so the landscape character<br>assessment<br>it talks about areas like this and areas<br>that have a lot of similarities<br>and a lot of similar history similar<br>land form and and so on so we<br>we need a character description a<br>descriptions that can be communicated<br>and to to have the aim to create an<br>arena<br>you could say arena for speaking because<br>these<br>this um image these lines these borders<br>in the in a landscape<br>character assessment they're not made<br>because the area is<br>a legal border it's just a descriptive<br>border<br>it it gives us an opportunity to to say<br>okay what goes on within these within<br>this area<br>has these uh these qualities or these<br>functions<br>so that's that's kind of the the core of<br>this method<br>to use the landscape character<br>assessment as<br>a way to be able to communicate about<br>the landscape<br>but then there are some other very<br>important things<br>that interacts with the landscape<br>character description<br>and that is that we need need deeper<br>understanding for the different aspects<br>of the landscape<br>as i said there is a very kind of<br>specialized<br>knowledge and information about the<br>landscape in sweden<br>and to assess what<br>rather to to approach these different<br>specialized bodies they could be<br>authorities<br>we need to understood and describe say<br>the historical time depth<br>we need to be solid in our knowledge of<br>what the landscape's<br>historical context is<br>we also need to be very well<br>acquainted with the form of the<br>landscape its<br>geomorphological uh development<br>appearance all the things that landscape<br>architects usually are<br>the professionals of you could say and<br>we really need an<br>understanding about the landscape<br>ecology because the ecology is<br>it was there first you could say and uh<br>especially with infrastructure we're<br>always<br>affecting systems because infrastructure<br>is a system<br>and ecology is also always a system<br>you could say and now i'm talking about<br>the structures and the connections which<br>are not just<br>uh specific<br>nature types but uh<br>habitats and networks which which work<br>together<br>so the thematic uh<br>the thematic studies the character<br>description<br>and something that i'll get back to<br>pitching in it a little and observing<br>what are the development trends can we<br>see<br>uh sensitivity and potential in in these<br>landscapes<br>because if you say for example the<br>forests<br>i mentioned there was a lot of forest in<br>sweden<br>because of a lot of decisions that's<br>been made<br>over the last 50 years we have very few<br>biological very little<br>biodiversity in our forests and you<br>could talk about<br>uh a destroyed<br>landscape and it's a fragmented<br>landscape<br>uh it's a landscape that's been altered<br>through drainage<br>and through the use of how we plant and<br>stuff so<br>already in this landscape we have a<br>sensitivity for things<br>uh that could put an<br>extra um strain on the landscape<br>but in that specific landscape we also<br>have a potential to perhaps<br>help some of the damage we've done<br>before and um<br>while we're investing in<br>so in um introducing the sensitivity and<br>potential<br>is to put the finger on structures<br>and characters that may be on the<br>on the border of of breaking down<br>and how we could avoid that and the<br>potential is about<br>how we could strengthen those<br>aspects of the landscape which may<br>actually<br>could be improved in some way<br>so if we simplify it the landscape<br>character assessment<br>is focused on asking these four<br>questions<br>what does the landscape look like and<br>why<br>what's going on in the landscape<br>what are the development trends what is<br>the ongoing processes<br>what are the sensitivities concerning<br>for example this with a fragmented<br>forests<br>and is there potential to enhance to<br>restore or create<br>values and functions in the landscapes<br>which makes it more resilient<br>in the future so this this set of<br>questions<br>is kind of the objective<br>and the the guideline to uh<br>to make a landscape carry the integrated<br>landscape character assessment<br>so one example is<br>just to show you that the scale can be<br>very<br>very big is<br>we we did uh integrated landscape<br>character assessment<br>of southern sweden<br>so this is about 100<br>000 square kilometers i don't know if<br>if you it's difficult just to say it's a<br>a number but anyway uh here in the south<br>of sweden stockholm is up<br>beyond this map uh there's a city of<br>gothenburg here for no<br>for those of you who may be acquainted<br>with sweden<br>and in the south we have several towns<br>where malmer copenhagen on the other<br>side<br>denmark is is the closest so<br>um through<br>making this following this method<br>uh we could characterize<br>uh the whole of this area to prepare it<br>uh for uh pulling or planning the<br>high-speed railway and<br>something that's interesting to observe<br>in this picture is that<br>if you want to characterize uh we often<br>find that the number of landscape<br>character types which contains<br>character areas which are specific they<br>are often<br>similar whether you're working on a huge<br>scale or small<br>small scale so in this case we found<br>that there were eight<br>landscape character types these are the<br>ones on the left<br>and that means they're kind of very<br>typical very clear landscape types so<br>if i just translate the first is like<br>the great plains<br>the plain landscape the second is the<br>mosaic landscape<br>the third is the esker landscape because<br>it's<br>characterized by a lot of structures<br>which are these eskas and so on<br>so and within each of these landscape<br>character types you will find specific<br>unique<br>uh character areas so um<br>if you look at the yellow ones for<br>example down here at the<br>the bottom of the map they are all part<br>of the plains landscape<br>but there are different character areas<br>so even on this very big scale<br>you are very planning very early<br>planning very strategic planning<br>you are able to to kind of start<br>somewhere and actually find<br>a way to characterize an area<br>so what we wanted to do within the<br>characterization was to<br>put a very easy way to co<br>an easy way to communicate these<br>different characters<br>uh even if this is just like a<br>simplified version of it<br>but just to show you uh we want to<br>make sure we know about the content the<br>physical features<br>the context what's going on what are the<br>functional networks for example the<br>spatial context<br>and what are the ongoing processes both<br>the natural and the man-made<br>so all of these things should be<br>included and by working with images like<br>these<br>two for example uh now this is in<br>swedish<br>uh but what it says is different kind of<br>elements like<br>um the the relative heights in this area<br>is<br>is a big uh it's a important part of the<br>character<br>it's close to the big cities so the<br>uh the green wedges<br>are actually used for urban recreation<br>for example<br>whilst in this area for example this is<br>a very regionalized<br>plains landscape where we've because of<br>the farming<br>uh gradually<br>produced problems in this landscape we<br>have no<br>almost no water left uh the the by<br>the small uh islands of biodiversity are<br>very scarce<br>and there's a social problem because the<br>the farms are kind of scattered<br>so we have like uh a depth almost you<br>could say<br>so in this type of landscape we have a<br>potential which differs from this type<br>of landscape<br>and the characters can also be very<br>clearly described<br>and to do this in a systematic way we<br>always use a kind of checklist<br>while we are out in the field<br>and even in this scale that i showed you<br>in the south of sweden we do field trips<br>it's a very very important part of the<br>method that<br>when you've done your field studies and<br>observed kind of the the different<br>aspects you could look at you always<br>need to go<br>out in the field and with an area like<br>this of course<br>and with a budget you don't have<br>budget and time that ends forever you<br>need to be sort of clear what you're<br>doing<br>so we usually put the the whole gang in<br>a<br>in a minibus and then we're driving for<br>two to three days uh in an area<br>observing with the help of these<br>checklists<br>about the landscape character uh and<br>what we are seeing<br>because you really need to see like<br>development trends we need to see<br>in our eyes what are the ongoing<br>processes<br>and we can of course have a lot of this<br>information from<br>also local governments and people living<br>in the area<br>but it's very important to see from for<br>yourself<br>so in this minibus that's kind of where<br>the integration<br>starts we need to have different<br>different fields of of work we need to<br>have people who work with ecology<br>cultural heritage planning landscape<br>architecture<br>and so on maybe geology or hydrology<br>and we always collect people from<br>our well usually it's a client but you<br>can of course if you have a<br>of a government structure with these<br>different<br>skills you can you don't have to to use<br>a consultant but<br>we always work very closely with a<br>client say local government who is an<br>expert in their area from these<br>different<br>sectors so together we travel and we<br>we observe the characters and what the<br>i mentioned we need the thematic studies<br>and to make the method relatively<br>repeatable and not too complex we've<br>decided on three<br>different thematic studies now these<br>systematic studies can be<br>expanded and they can include more<br>things than we've described in<br>in a publication i'll show you later<br>but a few examples then is the thematic<br>study of the landscape form<br>that includes base things like<br>what geology do we have<br>very important is the spatial context<br>what are the relative heights are the<br>very clear directions in the landscape<br>um what is the scale of these spatial<br>areas and stuff<br>so in the in the left picture here you<br>can see<br>a kind of regional assessment of the<br>sizes of open spaces<br>and now i'm not going to be able to sort<br>of<br>ask you questions while i'm doing this<br>talk but<br>i'll tell you instead that if you look<br>at the top<br>you can see these blobs they're quite<br>big whilst<br>in if you go further down they are very<br>small<br>so just by looking at this you will see<br>that in the north<br>we have a very large scale plane<br>structure whilst just south of that we<br>have a very small scale mosaic<br>structure and the the really big shape<br>going up and down that's a huge lake<br>um so the the landscape form is an<br>important<br>part of the theme study the landscape<br>ecology is extremely important<br>it's important because if you just use<br>the already available assessments so you<br>can find from your municipality your<br>local government<br>they will often only be made either in a<br>place where there's been a<br>a development say someone wants to build<br>something and we make an assessment of<br>this little area<br>or it's a designated area<br>that's been protected in some way but to<br>get a good<br>picture of the landscape how it works<br>its systems<br>with a lot for larger animals<br>or how the water what um<br>works we need a different type of<br>analysis<br>that is goes beyond borders beyond<br>uh designated areas and in the landscape<br>ecology we can find a lot of very<br>interesting<br>uh connections that need to be observed<br>uh while planning these large scale<br>structures<br>in the historical time depth<br>it's also possible to make an enormous<br>amount of very<br>interesting assessments<br>and in the historical depth<br>theme we often try to give a rich<br>description of<br>the reasons why the landscape looks the<br>way it does<br>and what decisions that was made<br>historically<br>that has produced the landscape today<br>and<br>quite often with the knowledge of the<br>landscapes<br>form say if you have an eska you have a<br>river<br>that meets a lake for example you have a<br>very strategic spot<br>that strategic spot is probably<br>as interesting and a hot spot in the<br>future as well<br>so um settlements<br>and interests in the landscape that have<br>been going on for a long time<br>often shows that it will be going on for<br>a long time in the future as well<br>so i'm just gonna move you about a<br>little so i can see<br>uh so i mentioned<br>this was an interdisciplinary method<br>um still we need<br>to us um we need to address<br>the specialized knowledge of these<br>different sectors that are very<br>established at least in our<br>planning system so what we've done<br>is we've tried to to work with<br>the the terminology that we usually work<br>with<br>in environmental impact assessments uh<br>this is an example of those kind of kind<br>of things<br>where the the green if you see the<br>the yellow the the yellow image here the<br>the green text comes from the ecology<br>red text comes from the cultural side<br>the blue text comes from planning and<br>social<br>sustainability side so when we are<br>describing<br>the character of the landscape or the<br>functions in the landscape or the<br>relationship<br>or relation to the landscape you can<br>have we always<br>we always sort of include all these<br>different aspects<br>um and<br>i think these effects or aspects<br>is a very important way to<br>make the right persons listen uh when we<br>talk about the sensitivity of the<br>character or the function in the<br>landscape or the potential we need to<br>use a vocabulary that is<br>established already within the<br>legislation<br>so to kind of conclude what we've been<br>achieving with this method<br>uh well let me let me tell you first the<br>the actual<br>development of the method went on for<br>about five years<br>and during that time there was um a lot<br>of<br>case studies uh of rail a road a small<br>scale of large scale projects<br>and finally it kind of landed in this<br>methodology called integrated landscape<br>character assessment<br>now this method is asked for<br>from the transport administration in<br>tenders so if<br>as a consultant you you are supplying<br>your services to<br>the transport administration they will<br>ask for a landscape analysis which has<br>been done<br>in the ilca or the integrated landscape<br>character assessment<br>method which means you have<br>a much more deeper understanding even in<br>the projects<br>even if this uh was actually<br>first so uh sort of for the you know<br>really large scale kind of national<br>regional planning it's now also used in<br>specific<br>projects so i think what<br>what what the transport administration<br>has found<br>is that so far this is the best we have<br>of finding a comprehensive knowledge of<br>the past<br>uh the the landscape both past present<br>and future so it gives us really a good<br>uh tool to know about the landscape we<br>can suddenly<br>start to talk about the landscape in a<br>in a way which is not just<br>guesses but it's really really very well<br>grounded<br>it's also a tool that really can<br>incorporate public participation<br>because when you one example is uh<br>when we characterize an area we<br>make an expert characterization we make<br>a line<br>and we describe a character which we<br>think<br>are uh suitable but then when you meet<br>the people who live in this area they<br>may have other<br>kinds of information like oh no that's<br>connected to this<br>and this history of this is whatever so<br>we when we have this public um<br>interaction we often change the<br>character borders<br>or uh complement the description of the<br>theme studies are<br>and and we've found that in a<br>development project such as a new road<br>if you start your conversation with the<br>pub with the affected public<br>by produ start to talk about the<br>landscape<br>the landscapes assets the landscapes<br>functions and characters<br>you're on completely different speaking<br>terms than if you start by saying<br>okay we're going to build a new road<br>here<br>so if you if you start with the<br>landscape perspective we also find it<br>it is going to influence this new road<br>in a completely different and more<br>participatory<br>way i think than than the traditional<br>way of planning a road<br>uh yeah so also<br>with this method because we've<br>identified<br>the sensitivity and potential in these<br>different<br>landscape character areas we really have<br>a potential<br>to strengthen landscape qualities as<br>well<br>because these uh six 622<br>billion swedish crowns they are a<br>huge investment and why not make<br>use of also giving an extra<br>er making an enhancement<br>to the landscape that can make it<br>function better<br>and not produce as many<br>bad side effects as as it has usually<br>been done<br>so um i don't know<br>bruno when if this area this um<br>lecture will be available afterwards<br>but i thought if you'd be interested<br>i've<br>added some some links uh<br>and i've tried to add links which are<br>because i i i appreciate that not a lot<br>of people know swedish<br>uh but but the good thing actually is<br>and you see there's a<br>an image here uh next to the the central<br>text<br>and that's a uh that's an english<br>description of the method that we also<br>use<br>in in the education<br>uh for students of landscape<br>architecture<br>uh so if you're sort of interested to<br>know a bit more about the method<br>it's described in this uh landscape as<br>yes okay well thank you i think i'll<br>stop there and<br>and let you uh let you<br>if you have any questions or<br>if you didn't understand or yeah<br>well thank you emily for this it was<br>very<br>very interesting um love the holistic<br>approach<br>to the entire assessment of the<br>landscape<br>um you know not seeing it as something<br>that is quantifiable that we need to<br>characterize and map and not do anything<br>with that<br>afterwards um okay so now it's time for<br>questions<br>um so you can either ask your question<br>directly to emily<br>or you can type your question in the<br>chat box<br>and we will read it to emily<br>i can see there is someone ready to go<br>sophie<br>oh okay yeah hi akira um bruno and kura<br>emily<br>it's um really lovely to hear you<br>describe this i'm finishing a phd<br>between copenhagen university and<br>victoria in wellington so i'm<br>very familiar with this idea of the of<br>the character<br>assessment but you described it really<br>excellently<br>thank you um i'm<br>curious i guess to know whether you<br>investigation to whether you can start<br>to integrate this with indigenous<br>worldviews as well<br>because for us in new zealand that's as<br>a settler<br>uh nation we have to we're being<br>um yeah we've been asked to<br>to consider primarily the knowledge of<br>our indigenous peoples and um we're<br>beginning to make<br>connections between our western way of<br>thinking about landscape with<br>uh with maori ones but i'm interested to<br>know perhaps you've done it with the<br>sami people or any other<br>people around sweden i can't say<br>we've we have experience from doing that<br>in fact i'd say that the part which is<br>aims to to identify the local relation<br>to the landscape<br>has not been uh as<br>the usual disciplinary<br>approach so i'd say that uh there's been<br>a<br>there's been a would you say ambition to<br>to really make sure that this is<br>included<br>in in the projects but it i<br>i'm afraid i'm ashamed to say that it<br>hasn't been<br>so far uh but<br>i say also that we have one project<br>which i only mentioned called the this<br>new high-speed railways in sweden<br>and this is a a gigantic project it's<br>really a<br>it's a huge project and in that<br>in the case of a big project like that<br>there's been a different type of<br>ambition and in the goals<br>for that projects project there is also<br>aims to include truly<br>people's views or knowledge you could<br>say about<br>about the landscape but that that is in<br>the southern of sweden<br>uh so it's it's actually not in fl<br>it's not affecting the traditional sami<br>regions<br>which is a bit north of stockholm and<br>further north<br>so no i'm sorry i i can't say but i'd<br>say that the ambition<br>and the possibility to do this is very<br>very good<br>sophia i'm not sure if you ask something<br>okay any other questions from our<br>audience<br>all right while i would give some time<br>emma<br>hi hi hi bruno<br>hi emma you can hear me yeah love is<br>good<br>um i was just wondering if emily had any<br>examples<br>of projects in in the roading sector<br>where they'd use<br>that and how it might have influenced<br>my examples are projects which is still<br>quite early in the planning<br>process because this is a method that<br>was really kind of<br>uh published in 2015<br>so it's been about five years since it's<br>been established<br>and i have several<br>nothing that um let me just think<br>if if i if i go to your question if it's<br>influenced the design<br>i could say yes it has in<br>a few examples we applied the method<br>on a project which was a new um<br>motorway uh through<br>a region of sweden called vestrajetaland<br>it's just north of gothenburg and<br>there we included uh<br>the um the knowledge of of these<br>deficiencies that have been going on in<br>the landscape like<br>uh changing the water uh<br>structures and also we had a very<br>participatory interaction with the<br>people who lived in this area<br>so for example when we tried to<br>evaluate different alternatives<br>because our task was to find different<br>alternatives<br>of a road we we found that through this<br>participation and through the<br>deficiencies or sensitivities we<br>identified<br>the road was um located in a different<br>route<br>and was uh kind of combined in a way<br>which<br>uh might not actually have been the most<br>economical way<br>uh but in the short term but in the long<br>term<br>it gave us great possibilities to<br>um to actually make sure that the<br>landscape and the people<br>could continue to develop so that's one<br>example<br>another example is one i'm working with<br>right now in the north of sweden which<br>is<br>uh a new railway uh connecting<br>two coastal well several coastal towns<br>one is called umio<br>and one is called lulio so this is<br>the bay of botnia which is right at the<br>top where finland and sweden meets<br>and this is really an area with a lot of<br>sami people<br>which has experienced uh<br>a fragmentation of their reindeer land<br>uh because of infrastructure<br>and there's been quite of i would say<br>ignorance but<br>not the transport administration hasn't<br>listened very well to them<br>earlier but uh through this project<br>we've been able to<br>um would you say when you locate<br>something together<br>so instead of um instead of putting the<br>railway in<br>in other other locations because of the<br>industry we've decided to really fight<br>very hard to<br>integrate it with uh the the existing<br>structure<br>meaning that we have now been able to<br>build or we are going to build two very<br>very<br>big fauna passages<br>which are going to also<br>change the barrier effect of the<br>existing structure<br>so this will really give a kind of um<br>and that's because we've we've<br>identified that this<br>these systems and structures they're<br>very wide they don't<br>they they're not just the very little<br>area we're looking at they're huge<br>so through this analysis we've been able<br>to identify that these<br>things are going on and we need to<br>accommodate the<br>problem and have a budget for it so<br>maybe that's an example as well<br>okay thank you emma for your question<br>and<br>emily dewey's two questions in a chat<br>box<br>yeah from danke at what level of<br>planning<br>strategic regional or local have you<br>been using this methodology<br>and at what level does it have the most<br>impact on a future infrastructure<br>location<br>i'd say that it's had mostly<br>it's mostly been used at the<br>local and regional<br>level we've used it in many projects<br>which is really the local level like<br>these two i<br>i mentioned now we are<br>waiting for a kind of a decision at the<br>transport administrations to make this<br>kind of<br>uh ilcas all over sweden for the regions<br>but that decision has not been taken so<br>only some regions have produced<br>these kind of ilcas and sometimes the<br>the driver has been their transport<br>administration but sometimes the driver<br>has actually been the local authority<br>no not local would you say regional<br>governmental authorities so we've made<br>several of these<br>ilcas for for regions<br>and that does not only include<br>infrastructure that also includes all<br>types of planning so i think<br>um right now i'd say it had most<br>impact on infrastructure location<br>because<br>now as i mentioned uh the transport<br>administration is asking<br>the consultants to produce uh this kind<br>of analysis<br>in every every big project so that's<br>really a very efficient way of getting<br>it done<br>um yeah so maybe that's maybe that's an<br>answer there<br>yeah and i think it kind of leads to the<br>next question as well<br>yeah how strict is the planning<br>legislation in sweden<br>for example if an infrastructure is<br>planned by<br>the original level spatial land use plan<br>is there room<br>to move it when working at the local<br>level<br>yeah i'd say that our regional planning<br>is not very strong<br>we don't if you compare our planning<br>system to say france for example<br>it's very different in france they have<br>a regional<br>uh level which is uh binding<br>as i've understood it anyway a kind of a<br>binding<br>uh guidelines not even guideline it's a<br>binding uh<br>what do you call it uh structure uh<br>for for how to proceed and then<br>municipalities needs to really com<br>always relate to this planning in sweden<br>the regional planning is emerging you<br>could say but it's not very strong in<br>our<br>legislation but there is a problem in a<br>way because we have very strong planning<br>initiative within the municipality the<br>local level<br>and very strong initiative within the<br>transport administration so we have<br>different legislations for<br>plan planning of roads and rail for<br>example<br>the the intention when<br>the transport administration decided to<br>develop this method<br>was that you would get a good start at<br>the<br>regional level uh in the spatial plan<br>kind of<br>applied on the local level but it's not<br>it's not perfect no<br>okay emily i think we're probably going<br>to stay here<br>because it's getting too late for you<br>yeah yeah<br>no no no no not for me but you need to<br>get to work and everything<br>um i think on on behalf<br>of victoria university and new zealand<br>institute of landscape architects i'd<br>like to thank you for sharing<br>and you know your work and your<br>experience with us i think<br>it's a very interesting topic at the<br>moment especially in new zealand when<br>thinking about changing our planning<br>tools at this stage um<br>and it's always nice to hear you know<br>what our<br>twin twin brothers are doing in<br>scandinavia<br>and also of course it's very nice to see<br>you and to hear you<br>as always um well thank you so much<br>for staying up until late and sharing<br>the knowledge with us and i'm sure<br>that's<br>it's gonna um you know make us think<br>deeply<br>uh for the rest of the day here in new<br>zealand<br>um i'd like to thank everyone that also<br>joined us uh i'm sure<br>from across the many corners of the<br>world<br>and everyone have a great day<br>or a great evening whatever you are<br>based and emily thank you so much i hope<br>to talk to you soon again<br>bye</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
