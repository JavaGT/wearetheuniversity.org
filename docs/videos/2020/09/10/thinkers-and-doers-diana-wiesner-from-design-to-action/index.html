Within this, urban public space is what helps our city’s natural endowments shine. Urban public spaces have their own, unique spatial structures and ecosystems, and should therefore come equipped with eco-systemic provisions, regulations, and public and cultural services; all of which boost civic solidarity, equality, and culture; and, in turn, lead to fluent public/private relations and better human health—both physical and emotional.<br><br>This lecture looks at the effects of globalization in finding efficient, replicable, and swift solutions that can be set in motion as fast as the world’s urban centres are growing; however, these tend to homogenize the urban landscape. Eco-urbanism and Green Infrastructure are two visions that endeavour to better contextualize urban ecology in a holistic and inclusive way. Climate change tests our resilience when confronting natural disasters; hence, nature-based solutions prioritize healthy ecosystems as the best means available to face the future. Eco-urbanism and Green Infrastructure-based solutions will succeed if backed by new, local, nature-based urban initiatives built on designs and approaches that aim to bring society together on the issues of how best to consume water, air, food; regulate temperature and provide rest and recreation for all of its members.<br><br>Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>warm

lecture<br>series<br>aims at bringing together practitioners<br>scholars<br>students and the wider community of<br>landscape architecture<br>and also any affiliated builds<br>environment disciplines<br>with the aim to share ideas and to hear<br>the latest innovations in the field<br>this is the initiative between the new<br>zealand institute of landscape<br>architects<br>wellington branch and our landscape<br>architecture program<br>at the university our<br>seventh speaker diana visner is the<br>founder<br>and director of the foundation servos de<br>bogota<br>and the head of architecture paisage<br>design office and she is very passionate<br>uh about enhancing the cultural values<br>of our landscapes<br>especially in her native colombia in<br>south america<br>diana believes that her approach seeks<br>to integrate<br>culturally based place making in<br>community participation to advance the<br>health and well-being<br>of humans and our ecosystems at local<br>regional and global scales<br>her outstanding 20 years career has<br>granted<br>many awards and invitations to<br>international conferences to celebrate<br>the potential of public spaces<br>not only for education but also for<br>cultural events<br>environmental and ecological<br>announcements recreation<br>and overall joy her lecture will be<br>titled<br>from design to action and we'll look at<br>urban<br>public spaces and their unique special<br>structures and ecosystems<br>and how they should therefore be<br>equipped with equi systematic provisions<br>regulations and

the<br>a pleasure here<br>sharing with you and being part of this<br>initiative and it's very in colombia<br>and what we are doing in our country<br>so i named these comforts from design to<br>action<br>because i have two shirts<br>one from designer and the other<br>like in a volunteer time a<br>committed citizen with our biodiversity<br>and our landscape in bogota so what i<br>want to share<br>it's a of course one of my passions<br>and that i began with<br>when i was very little with my mother<br>and everywhere in colombia we were<br>making rights and she was an artisan<br>and she was taking care of the artisans<br>in colombia<br>the majority you see<br>in the right is uh one of hers<br>works and the people that we know<br>in all of our travel in colombia where<br>incredible people giving<br>solving in a very artistic way<br>the the different ways to survive<br>and colombia is the is the country of<br>the chontaduro<br>they are chiote and the curcuma which<br>are the colors that you see there<br>where the landscape brings into<br>um handcrafts and we have those<br>incredible in colors and cultures<br>and if we talk about latin america in<br>general<br>is a continent of cities and if we talk<br>um about latin america we necessarily<br>requires talking about our common themes<br>such as the celebration of having<br>countries<br>with a worthwhile biodiversity a great<br>cultural force and a recognition of a<br>urban complexity<br>here is my city bogota and<br>this is the paramos where i am in love<br>with<br>are one of the most beautiful ecosystems<br>that we have<br>surround the city in only one hour<br>walking<br>but in this mega diverse country like<br>colombia<br>urban development has precise efficiency<br>over the landscape forces and human<br>forms of sensitive appropriation of the<br>territory<br>so my work has been trying to<br>put a powerful feeling of understanding<br>nature<br>but of course to understand the way<br>of relations from the people<br>to the territory and how to keep<br>this force and this<br>relation and in all of our work<br>vrettos and difficulties in our work<br>and i call me myself also an<br>artisan i'm i think i work with my hands<br>and i try to be very involved with with<br>the people<br>and the places and always<br>growing and always trying to catch<br>the feeling of the places so i'm going<br>to speak<br>first about some of the works we have<br>done<br>very quickly and then to turn into<br>what had been our relation and our<br>commitment<br>in our country like colombia<br>so we we talk about<br>honor to life because landscape<br>architecture is<br>always related with life and bringing<br>bringing different uh parts<br>in every each space that we design<br>with the life bringing life most of<br>all the most important is the water and<br>we are a country of water<br>colombia is a mega diverse country with<br>three<br>diverse mountains that<br>have a all kind of ranges and we have<br>a this big river that is the magdalena<br>river<br>but the people doesn't relate so very<br>well with that<br>river so we made different proposals<br>of different rivers in colombia so<br>people can relate<br>better with the environment<br>bringing the life near the river in an<br>amphibious way<br>and also with having a constructions<br>with the handcraft of the artisans of<br>the place<br>all other rivers in colombia this is in<br>the very south<br>in the center of one city that it's<br>called<br>pasto where the carnivals take<br>place we try to recover and<br>occupy space for the river and bring<br>the dynamics of the river even though it<br>was<br>contained in the city so we try to<br>make the celebration of life of the<br>carnivals<br>in the spaces of the pastor river<br>also we interview another river<br>here in bogota 22 kilometers<br>of a space that is a<br>the more contaminated river in bogota in<br>the very south<br>where families tried to survive and we<br>at the beginning in name this<br>project the socioecological corridor<br>that is called in the very south of the<br>city<br>but most of the of the space and the<br>project is more like bringing<br>families into the river so a<br>even though the our client was then<br>the mayor of bogota<br>he's main um perspective was<br>more free bringing in cyclo ways<br>and pathways and we tried to<br>make this a combination not only<br>to bring public space but al also to<br>bring nature<br>to the spaces and to recover the<br>wetlands<br>that are surrounding that neighborhoods<br>and the main important thing for us<br>was bringing families into nature in<br>different ways<br>another um thing that<br>we bring into our projects is simplicity<br>this is a growing in the<br>in the ground of a little<br>park that we have done in china in an<br>ifla competition and it was<br>bringing playfully places for the<br>chinese<br>like in colombia we play as we<br>all were also as persons<br>trying to breathing<br>playing and having fun in the landscape<br>so i draw the yamakas that are here<br>they were at colombian americas in china<br>they put<br>little part that it was called the<br>droplet water<br>because it was inspired in the force of<br>a<br>droplet water that makes like a<br>labyrinth<br>because living in colombia is like<br>living in a lot<br>in a labyrinth we never know what is<br>going to happen the next day<br>and colombia is a place where<br>we have abundance of water but also lack<br>of water<br>and that inscribes the landscape or the<br>types of<br>landscape we have so here in this park<br>we try to remember<br>the neblina which is this kind of<br>spaces where people with the dust<br>doesn't see each other and then<br>the nice things of this competition was<br>that the people<br>were voting for the um<br>art that they liked it most not a<br>judgment<br>of professionals it was from people<br>it was very nice so we have this and<br>common things from china and colombia it<br>was the bric<br>the guava the bamboo and<br>the orchids that we have<br>so we have the share in<br>types of details of landscape and we put<br>it in this<br>little garden<br>another thing is of course the imaginary<br>from people<br>all the works that we have done is<br>bringing<br>try to bring the multiplicity of all<br>social stories that make up a<br>park in the rural areas where people<br>is in bringing<br>agriculture and learning from<br>water and we try to do<br>all our best for bringing them<br>the quality of maintaining<br>their rituals and the agriculture<br>costumes<br>and all the way they relate with the<br>place<br>so the only things that we made was<br>trying to<br>process of treating<br>and people could learn about how could<br>an intervention give a by owner to<br>the<br>the biodiversity that it's there like<br>the rana's and the amphibious<br>and all that this is another project in<br>bogota this is a public library<br>we call this the forbidden because we<br>made<br>a proposal with all forbidden materials<br>that were in the public<br>category that it's from the city<br>and we bring these<br>stairs that we have for a<br>ventilator it was like<br>bringing a natural<br>air conditioning from the auditory in<br>the inside<br>and we bring this vegetation<br>and this crash brick that it's not<br>permitted<br>in our country even though all the city<br>is constructed with brick and we made<br>this<br>um this part at the at the beginning<br>it was very contradictory but<br>then people began to love it and<br>they as you see put love messages<br>in the ground the other<br>projects that we have done<br>try to bring<br>people like they feel at home and<br>with this with the this little detail of<br>the likes<br>and trying to bring people as feeling<br>income<br>and one of these that it was very with<br>the public's<br>in the in i'm sorry about my english<br>and this is like an egg that's because<br>we<br>we try to put this biodiversity<br>in little crickets<br>and<br>like an intention<br>and also it was very questioned<br>by malaysia's we call it here in bogota<br>it's called greece another project<br>it was in a master<br>plan for a school that is<br>a school of<br>of girls that have 80 hectares<br>of mountain in the city<br>so but we need to<br>make a recovery of the of the<br>design a plan where<br>the girls when they go<br>in the very beginning to interview the<br>forest with little plants<br>and when they get older at<br>bringing out because we need a plan<br>for recovering uh a forest<br>now i'm going to talk specifically<br>about our city passion of my life<br>we have a city of 8 million people and<br>a rural area very proud because we have<br>incredible water systems on the<br>mountains<br>and as you see here the paranos are one<br>of the most<br>beautiful landscapes of this<br>of the place where the neblina<br>it's like bringing water<br>into the plants and we have the<br>privilege of have<br>of having a lot of water to serve<br>the region because it condensed<br>in this triloconus plants so these<br>incredible landscapes<br>bring the water into the region<br>and are nearby surrounding the city<br>and the city hasn't known about that<br>because the city have has grown<br>without perceiving and having a<br>sensitive<br>relation with the landscape with the<br>water<br>and with the mountain system but<br>we are perfectly<br>conscious about this this incredible<br>potential that we have and we made a<br>proposal<br>to honor our mountains<br>we make um a study because we have<br>been looking what in all the years that<br>we have<br>in the city the city haven't had not<br>recognized this privilege and now that<br>we are inquiring teams we understand<br>more<br>that the importance of this we have also<br>a system of wetlands that have been<br>occupied by the urbanization<br>and we have still asabana the bogota<br>which is a territory that has<br>the agrological quality to<br>bring food to the people of bogota<br>but we haven't really realized that and<br>the city has been growing and growing<br>over this ecosystems and also<br>even being like um<br>insensitive about the people that lives<br>there<br>like this beautiful campesina<br>so what we have from our rivers<br>now these forces of nature we<br>have<br>changed and this<br>a slowly way of going very<br>in the in the mountains with 120<br>streams but they are convert in these<br>channels giving a poor<br>organism so we<br>proposed 10 years ago<br>to have the right of the mountains that<br>people have the right<br>to enjoy the mountains<br>to have a mountains that they can go to<br>then they can be human taking in account<br>the people<br>they can be healthy bringing health to<br>people<br>psychological emotional physical health<br>to people<br>to be sustainable because all this water<br>that is coming from the mountains<br>cannot go into everywhere anywhere into<br>a tube<br>in the in the city and also of course to<br>be resilient<br>so in that time 10 years ago we proposed<br>a corridor a space that people can enjoy<br>the mountain<br>bringing like a limit from the city to<br>the mountains<br>and they and and we talk about<br>like an ecological agreement<br>from the people to the nature<br>it was very difficult because it was not<br>only<br>this kind of images that i'm showing to<br>you<br>which was only recognizing<br>what it was happening there here the<br>agricultural parks<br>we put that people can enjoy<br>parks but bringing an edge so<br>people know where the city and<br>it was ten years ago and we tried to<br>tell them that all the schools<br>that and the universities could teach in<br>the mountain<br>but they didn't hear us we have i have<br>been<br>um published in<br>all the landscape magazines in the world<br>recognitions but here in my country<br>we haven't been recognized we have been<br>taught that we have to restore our<br>mountain with collaboration of the<br>people<br>bringing the people that lives near the<br>mountains<br>coming being part of it<br>we tell them that we can perceive<br>all our cities in all these 53<br>kilometers long<br>around the city with our feet and our<br>senses being sensitive with the people<br>that lives there<br>and being participated with<br>bringing and transforming this border<br>but 10 years ago i was<br>it was incredible but there was no<br>political decision<br>there was no political priority about<br>the mountains and we also talk about the<br>importance of the rivers<br>that we have in the savannah and to<br>bring into the rioja gotham<br>and to restore all these parks<br>with the water and bringing culture of<br>water to the people<br>and having examples of many many cities<br>around the world<br>about ecologies and projective ecologies<br>bringing water as the center or the axis<br>of the design<br>and all the things that of course you<br>all know<br>and our river that is the bogota river<br>that is very contaminated<br>we also propose to have different<br>systems of bringing the madrid's viejas<br>again to life so<br>the river and the mountains would not be<br>a limit of the city only<br>but the axis of the region in a<br>biodiversity<br>and a landscape perspective and we made<br>all the proposals<br>to defend our savannah de bogota<br>which is a place where we can grow food<br>his way because of course these are<br>and you know<br>there are the times or the the very low<br>times of the institutions<br>that they don't do anything<br>the academia that is going in a way<br>different from the activist life from<br>the citizen life<br>the academia is<br>in their spaces and the activists<br>people the citizens that are<br>saying what is going to happen what is<br>need to be happening<br>and of course the time of nature which<br>is<br>glowing so that's why we began<br>to be like having a delicate activism<br>we began to say that our mountains were<br>the main<br>importance in the in the country our<br>main<br>patrimony cultural and natural patrimony<br>and the people need to work in an<br>agreement to change the situation<br>this is this is us we are the<br>foundation we feel like a part of an<br>ecosystem<br>this is our webpage where we introduce<br>ourselves<br>and we are part of this this system<br>and we make decisions<br>we decide to we don't have<br>money we don't have we were only<br>volunteers<br>so we what happened is doing a network<br>and we began with the children we have<br>18<br>schools in the mountains so we began<br>that children<br>are the most important force to change<br>the way the adults think because i was<br>very<br>upset it was nothing happened the<br>politicals didn't hear us<br>and we need the voices of the children<br>so we began<br>like a strategy bringing children from<br>all the different cultural origins<br>from all times of schools surround<br>biodiversity<br>and landscape and we began<br>doing competitions saying what where<br>basin do you live do you know do you<br>have a river nearby<br>or it was under the ground<br>draw us a map and tell us what is<br>happening in your place<br>and all we have like 2 000<br>drawings and maps from all children<br>around<br>our region and we were<br>convinced that children's and citizens<br>with a greater knowledge<br>we they can manage and participate in<br>decision making<br>and of course including<br>education educators and bringing a<br>different way of reasoning of doing the<br>city<br>so we began a very big big<br>movement bringing the children together<br>knowing what the children of one school<br>was making and<br>in the other and of course recognizing<br>all the voices of of the children<br>from the voice of a country in a time of<br>post<br>conflict and a peace process it is<br>essential to aim<br>at building communities that appropriate<br>a respectful<br>and eco-friendly culture with the<br>environment<br>as well as to recognize from a human<br>perspective<br>that the practices existing in the<br>different urban settlements<br>in order to strengthen the dialogue that<br>allows a real transformation<br>we were convinced that<br>we began to work with them we began to<br>draw<br>a cuentos stories<br>from our biodiversity here they don't<br>teach<br>about<br>our local diversity they don't teach we<br>began also<br>bringing people that lives and defend<br>their territories<br>trying to bring a social conception of<br>the landscape<br>the place of the world in the<br>construction of<br>the conceptual part of the landscape but<br>from the voices<br>of the people so as fakie naruto said<br>the landscape begins to really revive<br>when i begin to read in the worlds of<br>the ground<br>which it's an inhabitants have been<br>written<br>all about it over time<br>so we began different movements trying<br>to bring<br>people together bringing words being<br>bringing images<br>we we began a drawing that it's it was<br>called collectible<br>we were like 20 people from the citizens<br>drawing the mountains and giving the<br>names of the hills and streams<br>and having this huge<br>drawing collective drone that it was<br>exposed<br>in the bogota museum and we are making<br>campaigns about<br>the importance of our mountains of our<br>patrolmen<br>and people cannot be more in the<br>indifference of this<br>so we bring everywhere we want from<br>drawings from collective<br>movements from articles in the newspaper<br>uh from bringing children into the<br>action<br>and then we have this place<br>this is a place that we have like three<br>hectares<br>in the mountains and we call it a<br>laboratory of transformation<br>and here in this laboratory<br>we opened our doors for the people and<br>said<br>the mountain needs you the mountain<br>needs<br>your intervention and we try in this<br>little<br>piece of the mountain to have this<br>experiment for example of our proposal<br>10 years ago of what we<br>were imagining about our proposal<br>and it was that people can restore and<br>people need to restore the mountain<br>because if people do it<br>and involves they change the way they<br>relate with<br>with the nature and in that way they can<br>push the politicians to change the way<br>they think<br>the way they prioritize the things<br>in the city and in this place<br>from more than five years the mountain<br>has been speaking every friday<br>in workshops of ecological citizen<br>culture<br>called bogota landscape chair<br>here in this place<br>the place become like a catalyzer<br>generating<br>more breathtaking social transformation<br>than infra<br>in that inauguration of infrastructure<br>so what i was<br>telling we don't need to do an<br>infrastructure<br>work we need to bring people<br>in transforming the place we need that<br>people<br>learn about the importance<br>invite different people to talk and also<br>the mountain dresses in colors of silent<br>manifestations<br>of delicate activism in collective<br>works such as those that you can see<br>here<br>from only collecting leaves<br>and doing different ways we bring<br>art into nature to to<br>not only to insist of the importance of<br>the ecological<br>but to insist in the importance of the<br>relations<br>and here we have like a manifestation<br>that was<br>your older flowers of the<br>and we began like<br>an honor to the decomposition and we<br>began<br>with that kind of work and also<br>all the work with the children with the<br>maps<br>the maps of the children while talking<br>about<br>how they imagine the future city<br>here the children are in<br>thinking and uh dreaming about<br>what the future of the<br>of the city could be so<br>and our work is focused<br>on consolidating it with actors mainly<br>children and young people to the<br>formation of a network<br>action and listen collect and generate<br>consensus<br>of the visions of the city and its<br>landscape<br>children have been involved in citizen<br>science<br>they can measure they can observe they<br>can<br>have fun here there's a map of our<br>children near the cordova river<br>and here hector daniel and juan vanessa<br>in the very south of the city they<br>express<br>their sensitivity towards their<br>territory and their concern<br>about what they might happen there<br>because<br>this their neighborhood is in pressure<br>of bringing them out about because of<br>the<br>because of a risk so what we have<br>done is like many little points like a<br>acupuncture points<br>with networks bringing what people is<br>doing<br>the other activists the children<br>and bringing in all these kind of<br>and we and i could bring<br>my dream about the socio-ecological<br>corridor<br>in all the 53 kilometers but doing<br>with the people doing that recognizing<br>all the what people were doing<br>so we try now to reduce the distances<br>between research practice and political<br>decisions<br>we want to hear the voices and the<br>proposals of the children<br>and young people to take action and<br>become<br>citizens and agents of time of change so<br>that<br>is of course consistent from practice<br>from the neighborhoods and from the<br>thank you so much diana muchas gracias<br>i i've seen you presenting before<br>uh and i was of course amazed with the<br>work we have been doing<br>but you just blown me away with the<br>quantity of work that has been put<br>into all of this it's it's amazing and<br>and i mean like in the impact um<br>that it's creating an awareness that is<br>creating on people and especially<br>in children it's just it's just amazing<br>i i'm i'm so<br>um you know excited to see the work<br>and how much has developed as well<br>throughout these years<br>but um all of this has been<br>made on a voluntary basis right<br>so i i just find this is absolutely<br>amazing<br>um so now i i hope that<br>um there will be some very interesting<br>questions coming from from people<br>um i'm just gonna give them<br>some warming up um i think one of the<br>main<br>questions that i would have for you um<br>and i<br>from all your talk i understand it there<br>is a lot of<br>um you know public awareness but mostly<br>political<br>uh influence and decision um<br>how has that changed throughout the<br>years do you think that<br>those in power are far more aware of the<br>importance<br>of the mountains and biodiversity but<br>also the work<br>of landscape architects yes<br>i think the now we have an incredible<br>opportunity<br>because there are two things one is that<br>everybody is in home at home<br>seeing the mountains from the inside and<br>trying to<br>to dream about to walk in that mountains<br>and we don't have the possibility so we<br>i i think<br>it's not a for me i don't need to say it<br>because people are feeling that they<br>need it<br>and the two the second thing that it's<br>good very good that<br>we have a new major it's a woman mayor<br>that is very sensitive in nature and i<br>think<br>this is a unique time to bring<br>this opportunity that people need the<br>nature<br>people need to change relation with<br>nature but they need of course to enjoy<br>it<br>and we are pressuring her to<br>bring this project into life bring this<br>dream that we have been pushing<br>that 10 years ago into life but with<br>people<br>she is very sensitive and i am very<br>hopeful hopeful that she is going to<br>have have resonance in what we have been<br>saying these last years<br>well that's amazing i hope that<br>something will happen<br>and the new mayor would really have some<br>willingness to put<br>some of these amazing ideas into action<br>um uh opening to<br>all our participants and if you have any<br>questions<br>you can either ask directly to<br>diana don't forget to unmute yourself<br>um or if you're a little shy you can<br>anyone<br>hi bruno andiano this is gloria ceravia<br>from santiago de chile<br>nice to see you nice to meet you both um<br>thank you diana for your presentation it<br>was really<br>as bruno said incredible to see how you<br>achieve children that's a great<br>work for from landscape architecture<br>because we have many problems um<br>also here in chile and santiago and i<br>would like you<br>i would like to ask diana what about<br>your new strategies<br>you said that ten years ago it was very<br>difficult because uh<br>themes about post conflict in colombia<br>and things like that it was um kind of<br>difficult to<br>achieve the the hills or go to the<br>landscape and what about now<br>so you have new strategies that are um<br>more about clarification urban<br>planification<br>or you continue to work with the<br>well the the problem was not the<br>conflict in colombia because the<br>mountains are<br>surrounding the city and the city of<br>course it has problems of security as<br>anyone<br>but it's a problem of a having<br>bringing people that have no<br>opportunities and work with this project<br>so we made this a planning proposal<br>10 years ago it was the political<br>decision it was not<br>when i when i bring this<br>proposal it was published in all the<br>newspapers and everything<br>but the next mayor was in jail because<br>he<br>didn't expend the<br>the money in what they they need<br>and then it was another and another<br>major that they didn't<br>bring like a priority in the mountains<br>of bring<br>proposals that were not<br>involving people so it was the most<br>it was the difficulty but when we began<br>like 10 years ago working in our<br>foundation<br>a it was incredible and<br>i what i was trying to show you<br>today it was how much um<br>many initiatives were going on<br>from people defending their territories<br>and<br>and from us with the children so our<br>um strategy now because we don't need to<br>have more plants we<br>have like many plants here in in the<br>mountains we have<br>a lot of design and plants we need to we<br>need<br>action so that's why we we make this<br>this action in our little<br>mountain reserve and we make this all<br>these children<br>coming and pushing pushing in hard<br>about their voices now we have um<br>also a good moment because we are<br>defining our territory territorial plan<br>and i have this yesterday called that<br>they they hear me and they are bringing<br>the children<br>in in decisions of the planning of the<br>politics of bogota<br>and uh and we will be working with them<br>with the children and taking account<br>their decisions<br>for people from the normal people it's<br>like craziness because they say what can<br>a children say<br>but i'm convinced that the ideas are<br>incredible<br>and i hope i have heard him and i i have<br>heard them and i have received their<br>maps<br>and i have i have seen so many<br>ideas of involving nature into the<br>planning board<br>and when this call yesterday they told<br>me yes<br>the children are taken in account the<br>ministry is going to<br>bring all of the children of bogota<br>and the the participation of this plan<br>so i'm very happy<br>because we are like having success on<br>that<br>of course there is no no infrastructure<br>not nothing but<br>we need more to change relations from<br>the peoples<br>and if children are involved the family<br>are involved the teachers are involved<br>so<br>we are going to make a real revolution<br>well thank you that's great and<br>congratulations<br>about that i i work here in in santiago<br>de chile universidad catolica<br>and i'm guiding a research about<br>water landscapes in south chile the<br>the lakes so it's a very good initiative<br>and<br>thank you very much for answering i love<br>it i<br>love children thank you gloria thank you<br>thank you thank you<br>we have two questions uh in our chat box<br>the first one is from evan santa marina<br>um what are the most challenging issues<br>bogota faces in terms of resilience<br>today<br>well as maybe i<br>talk but very quickly we have a great<br>savannah<br>that it's a ground a agricultural<br>place that it was very pressure<br>about urbanisms and<br>the last plans were to<br>urbanize that area and we have a very<br>huge<br>um<br>discussion about that and<br>in this this mayor said we are not going<br>to allow that<br>so we are very happiest also because<br>i have done many images of to the bogota<br>saying what is going to happen if we<br>have urbanized that<br>and what is happening if we don't<br>urgenize that space<br>we can have bring food from people<br>inside bogota<br>we can have biodiversity we can have<br>parks<br>and we want that with many people of<br>course women's citizens<br>we want that discussion and<br>retail yes like um<br>because uh the<br>classical europeanism doesn't<br>take in account bringing a<br>new green and loose infrastructure<br>we are still struggling with that and<br>there is conventional urbanism still<br>in every part of the city<br>we have many many many difficulties<br>here about pressuring our ecosystems<br>and taking and maintaining them<br>thank you there is another question from<br>mel also in the chat box<br>is flooding a major issue along the<br>river<br>what sort of design interventions have<br>been proposed to deal with this<br>in the future<br>yes what i show in a park it was in the<br>bogota river it was<br>channelized mostly but<br>we make a proposal<br>that we can have we can recover<br>i don't know if you understand me but i<br>i don't know how to say it in english<br>so we design with<br>like a restoration of bringing and<br>trying to clean the water with these<br>macrophyte systems in natural<br>natural ways with a hydrological<br>ways of passing the water through this<br>is in design<br>of course we are all again struggling<br>that<br>the environmental agencies take<br>okay any any final questions<br>now like everyone is very quiet<br>okay i will i will then um<br>close this session uh muchas
