book she's been<br>working on um so lisa is<br>our engagement<br>senior engagement something<br>in the school of detail that's good um<br>yeah i'll hand over to lisa and then<br>i'll come back at the end<br>and i'll help facilitate any questions<br>there are so<br>um lisa you should be able to<br>thank you thank you i will set set it up<br>hi everyone i'm going to talk a little<br>bit about<br>designing and communicating biomaterials<br>which is the topic<br>very close to my heart it's about<br>combining<br>university education and research<br>and sustainability collaboration<br>so i'm lisa terwinen i'm a<br>design manager and i originally studied<br>audiovisual media culture<br>at the university of lapland at the<br>arctic circle<br>for my bachelors and then<br>i studied new media design for my<br>masters<br>at alder university in helsinki finland<br>now i'm a senior engagement advisor in<br>design here at the school of design<br>innovation<br>coming from finland i thought it's a<br>good to<br>do a little comparison so finland<br>is a little bit more north than new<br>zealand east to the south<br>land area and population are a little<br>bit bigger in finland<br>you can see we're 5.5 million in finland<br>and<br>5 million roughly in new zealand<br>and forests seem to be double in finland<br>compared to new zealand<br>so first cover 76 of the land area in<br>finland<br>and actually measured by the<br>proportional share of forest land<br>finland is the most forested country in<br>so coming from finland i love forests<br>all finns love forests and they are such<br>an important<br>and everyday part of our lives there<br>and because finland is just forest and<br>more than 100 000 lakes<br>the wood cellulose has traditionally had<br>a remarkable role<br>in the finnish industry although the<br>products have been mainly<br>high volume but low added value products<br>with no design<br>involved such as paper products<br>but things are changing now<br>on the other hand a design driven<br>approach<br>enables generation of low volume<br>but high value industry so there's an<br>interest in changing sorry interest in<br>biomaterials<br>back in 2016 i was working as<br>a design research assistant at other<br>university<br>and got into the biomaterial world and<br>communicating research<br>it was really interesting to work with<br>some of the world leading scientists in<br>the field of wood chemistry<br>so i worked in a project called alder<br>kmart<br>which is a collaboration between school<br>of chemical engineering<br>a school of arts design and architecture<br>that would be arts<br>then we get the name kmart and camera<br>started in 2011.<br>the aim of cameras is to create new<br>concepts for bioeconomy<br>for combining design business thinking<br>and natural materials science<br>it's super interesting so their main<br>focus is on material called cellulose<br>which is the most abundant organic<br>biopolymer on earth<br>so in other words plants contain<br>cellulose and we have a lot of plants in<br>this planet<br>and in cambridge we focus on wood-based<br>cellulose<br>coming from finland forests wood and<br>then wood best cellulose make<br>sense how cameras works<br>is that they collaborate with<br>international projects<br>research and offer multi-disciplinary<br>courses for university students in alta<br>and most prominent is the kmart summer<br>school<br>where students focus the whole summer on<br>developing their own<br>bio-based material explorations and<br>projects<br>so every year there are 10 20<br>more new bio-based material explorations<br>created by the students<br>that are well documented and<br>communicated as<br>exhibitions professionally taking<br>photographs and brochures<br>the projects are also on the kmart's<br>website<br>so the past nine years there have been a<br>lot of<br>good projects and as the biomaterial<br>field<br>has been growing and interest in design<br>world has increased<br>in replacing plastics and finding more<br>sustainable materials<br>cayman staff wanted to share some of<br>their knowledge to the community<br>so we formed a theme in spring 2019<br>and started working so everybody else in<br>this picture they are<br>in finland and working um at the time at<br>the university and i was invited to join<br>their team<br>remotely so here's the core book team<br>with professor stephanie imperio<br>who run the kmarts also designer nina<br>who is nowadays the hands-on biomaterial<br>expert<br>she studied originally graphic design<br>and<br>then there is textile designers last<br>photographer eva<br>who has taken all the amazing k-mart's<br>photos since the beginning of the<br>program<br>then we had also skilled graphic<br>designer<br>and all the arts books publishing<br>company<br>and few content writers and experts<br>to provide more content<br>so my role was in co-editing project<br>management and helping to shape the book<br>into a great user experience but also to<br>help in the communication<br>and marketing related to the book launch<br>so i won't go or even can't go too much<br>details in the chemistry<br>in this talk that's not my expertise but<br>if you have questions related to that<br>and certain projects i can see if i can<br>reach some of the<br>experts afterwards<br>and here's the book so it came out late<br>april this year<br>and it took about a year or so to put it<br>all together a little bit more than a<br>year<br>and um it offers both simple and more<br>advanced ideas and recipes<br>for these experiments with wood-based<br>materials<br>it showcases interesting results<br>focusing on the raw materials that are<br>processed either chemically or<br>mechanically<br>from trees but also other plants<br>and there are different level projects<br>so you can do stuff at home workshops or<br>chemistry labs<br>depending on your level and access to<br>raw materials and tools<br>let's see a little intro video<br>our material world is changing and in<br>the coming years<br>this change will be dramatic in parallel<br>with climate change<br>our lifestyles will also change this<br>in response we made a cookbook of<br>experiments featuring wood<br>and plant-based materials especially<br>cellulose here in finland we are<br>specialists in this field<br>seventy percent of our country is<br>covered by forests in which we strive to<br>take good care<br>the chem arts cookbook gives you both<br>simple and more advanced ideas and<br>recipes<br>for hands-on experiments we aim to<br>inspire you to explore the potential of<br>materials<br>we encourage playful hands-on<br>experiments and explorations with our<br>recipes<br>get inspired test the recipes in your<br>workshops or labs<br>develop your own experiments and new<br>materials<br>so this is a video i made in lockdown<br>here in wellington<br>as we couldn't have the book launch in<br>finland<br>you may be recognized the voice over<br>it's nan from our school here<br>so we made a decision to launch the book<br>as a free online version<br>and there's also a beautiful beautiful<br>printed book that one can order<br>but uh do you call it and mail not<br>coming from europe<br>to new zealand still you need a focus<br>now i haven't seen that live myself yet<br>so the book is aimed for designers and<br>material enthusiasts<br>university students and can be used as<br>a study book so we wanted to give enough<br>basic information<br>about materials and working in lab<br>environment<br>but also to explain some of the basic<br>working methods and little bit about the<br>chemistry<br>so we have a section called working with<br>the book introduces different kind of<br>wood-based raw materials<br>as you can see from this picture there<br>are several kind of cellulose materials<br>i would call it quite a numerical<br>material<br>as you can create for example soft hard<br>flexible strong light or transparent<br>materials<br>then we also have a little bit about<br>maldives multi-disciplinary<br>collaboration in the book<br>and this is something k-mart has been<br>focusing on since its beginning<br>so we always say to students be brave to<br>ask opinions<br>do your background research listen to<br>others<br>keep an open mind if you don't<br>understand something<br>ask and communication is definitely the<br>key<br>in collaboration and important<br>as developing new materials and design<br>is to agree on intellectual property<br>rights<br>then we get into the core of the book<br>the recipes<br>and we have divided them in the book by<br>here's an example of a recipe that uses<br>pine bark<br>and microfibril cellulose and creates<br>new<br>all wood material the material resembles<br>nature and smell feel and appearance<br>it's really nice and the end result is<br>light and durable<br>and can be made into either sheets or<br>here's another hard material it's<br>redwood project by linda vanni<br>and her aim was to explore how original<br>tactile qualities of wood<br>could be retrieved by creating materials<br>from sawdust<br>and carboxymetal cellulose she used<br>molds to produce model wall tiles for<br>decoration<br>and acoustics<br>this is common read panel by bivi<br>latinen<br>common grid grows on waterfronts and has<br>traditionally been used in<br>for example roofs and carpets<br>and this recipe shows a way to simply<br>glue together<br>common reed panels using pulp<br>and the panels become quite strong but<br>are not water resistant<br>which is the common thing with cellulose<br>materials<br>here is walla lose by surabi surrender<br>and by planting wool and wood-based<br>cellulose<br>was discovered new textures and shapes<br>with intriguing haptic properties<br>the ingredients include also natural<br>pigments such<br>and by the way all these beautiful<br>images in this presentation and in the<br>book they are<br>by eva who i mentioned before and the<br>team<br>then we have soft materials these<br>are pulp forms forming is a way of<br>adding air to materials and<br>increasing the bulkiness and softness<br>this is a recipe one can do at home<br>easily with the blender dishwashing<br>liquid<br>and egg cardone foam pop<br>can potentially be used to make products<br>that are affordable<br>and you can also create films and<br>transparent materials<br>these are biodegradable and<br>bio-compatible films<br>could be replacing plastics in some<br>applications for example<br>and these samples are colored using<br>indigo pigment<br>they're really light making diy slimes<br>has become<br>extremely popular in recent years<br>especially among school children<br>this bias line is stretchable elastic<br>and slightly sticky<br>it contains no toxic or harmful<br>chemicals<br>when playing is done it can be<br>composted or recycled in a bio bin<br>we have recipes for growing materials<br>this has been extremely popular<br>direction the past years within camera<br>students<br>so kombucha besides being a drink it can<br>be used for<br>here are some kombucha lamps by monica<br>fidei<br>summer school 2016<br>and growing the kombucha part took her<br>about<br>8 weeks and recycling of kombucha is not<br>a problem because bacterial cellulose is<br>then we have printable materials here we<br>have patterns that were made with<br>extruding cellulose<br>can be used in various applications for<br>example for creating<br>accessories or in art installations<br>this recipe focuses on shrinkage as a<br>result of drying cellulose materials<br>and creating these three-dimensional<br>shapes<br>many of the outcomes are surprising in<br>their strength<br>and beauty this one is by<br>megan mclean and last year's summer<br>school<br>so that was some of the projects that<br>can be found in the book<br>there are also some interviews i made<br>with industry professionals who are<br>telling how it is to work with materials<br>and<br>how to build a career in this field<br>i hope you enjoyed this little talk and<br>you can check out the kmart's website<br>for more information<br>and to download the book if you're<br>thank you<br>thank you very much lisa thank you<br>does anyone yes we have a question from<br>reagan okay<br>lisa does um does the does the book<br>give you um uh is it sort of like a<br>cookbook<br>that you can actually follow a recipe to<br>make things like bio slime<br>yes definitely so it has always like<br>ingredients<br>list of ingredients list of tools and<br>then step by step<br>instructions how to how to actually make<br>other questions<br>i can also share a link um<br>let me share a link to the chat so then<br>people who are joining online can<br>download link but also link to the<br>camera website where is more information<br>about the book<br>um and i can show<br>just really briefly the<br>i have the downloaded the<br>like<br>so here we can see um<br>a little bit of the book how it looks<br>inside<br>so we have introduction we have working<br>with materials recipes and then<br>inspiration part<br>and<br>a lot of a lot of images but also a lot<br>of basic<br>and research<br>materials and then going on to the<br>methods and the actual recipes so<br>there's like about 200<br>pages of of information<br>any other questions um i have one<br>actually<br>have you have you seen um<br>kind of the results of any of this like<br>have people<br>applied these recipes to any like<br>products or<br>designs yeah that's a good question like<br>when we launched this and we had<br>a little campaign in social media so we<br>asked people to post<br>using hashtag kmarts and it was nice to<br>see that<br>um because there's a quite active<br>biomaterials design community<br>around the world so people were posting<br>in their instagram stories<br>different experiments and everybody was<br>in lockdown so they were kind of using<br>whatever they had at home<br>and and kind of cooking in their<br>kitchens or<br>i don't know and and making different<br>kind of uh<br>explorations so that that's something<br>that i have seen i haven't seen anything<br>further yet but<br>it was quite interesting to see that it<br>was already received<br>um in a positive way and we got a lot of<br>uh feedback also that people were happy<br>that this information is<br>um available for free that is that you<br>can just download the book and get the<br>recipes<br>so zach is asking if the cellulose<br>materials<br>are easy to get um that's a<br>little bit of a problem like in<br>different parts of the world i would<br>recommend using<br>whatever is available in your part of<br>the world and it also doesn't make sense<br>to<br>maybe use wood-based cellulose in<br>countries where you don't have a lot of<br>wood but<br>maybe you have banana trees or bananas<br>or rice or something<br>so you can see what what is the basic<br>raw materials<br>in in your areas research centers that<br>could be available more easily<br>but so the wood-based materials it's<br>definitely easy to get in finland<br>but i'm not sure if we could get them so<br>easily here<br>but then we could replace those with<br>ingredients<br>maybe i'll ask how long it took for the<br>project to come together<br>sorry i couldn't quite here lisa how<br>long did it take<br>for the whole project to come together<br>um well the book<br>took a little bit more than a year but<br>then<br>of course the content has been created<br>throughout<br>nine years in kmart studies<br>so nine nine plus nine plus one year<br>okay um well everybody<br>that was great yeah really interesting<br>stuff<br>i'm just a reminder that we still want<br>people from the school of design to<br>um sign up for these atrium talks so<br>if that's you and you felt inspired<br>today please get in touch with<br>myself regan or becky um and<br>i'll just say next week we have the<br>ritual atrium talk by jason carpenter<br>who is a technical consultant from<br>building point australia<br>and they oversee the trimble building<br>suite of tools which<br>combines 3d modelling digital set out<br>laser scanning cloud-based collaboration<br>and mixed reality solutions<br>into the one refined design and<br>construction workflow<br>sounds pretty interesting pretty<br>innovative<br>um oh one more question from zach which<br>is your favorite recipe<br>oh man i don't know<br>well i have to say that i tried during<br>lockdown<br>the pulp foam so i could actually do it<br>at home so that was really<br>like easy and hands-on if you want to<br>start something even with the kids and<br>do some material science and design at<br>home so that's<br>cool we'll have to take a closer look at<br>the book<br>yeah okay thank you very much thank you<br>everybody<br>everyone</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
