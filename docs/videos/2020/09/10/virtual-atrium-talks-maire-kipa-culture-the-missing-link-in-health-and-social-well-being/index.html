These elements promote the Mauri Factor for example: Mana Atua, Mana Moana, Mana Whenua, and Mana Tangata are references to the interconnectedness and indicators of the vitality of the lifeforce or Mauri.<br><br>Cultural expressions of living, entertainment, and dying are all bound together in tika - the right ways, pono - to be fair and just, aroha in the spirit of reciprocity and love. The question is “are we all in this<br>together”?<br><br>The Wellington Faculty of Architecture and Design Innovation’s Virtual Atrium Talks are a series of seminars where staff, PhD students, and external design and built environment practitioners present their current research and seek feedback from the community.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may

in terms of recovery planning and<br>going forward<br>a lot of emphasis was on infrastructure<br>on um buildings on<br>uh the important sources of energy that<br>we need to have to have a city and<br>homes running and what has been lost in<br>that<br>i felt for maori was uh the cultural<br>aspect of recovery<br>and so what is important about culture<br>is how we identify as people and and<br>whether we feel we belong<br>and how strongly our connections are to<br>the places<br>and our for me for what partner<br>so i wanted to talk about that today<br>because with covert<br>10 years later after an earthquake and<br>looking at the recovery planning that<br>happened there<br>and covert i feel uh with the pandemic<br>response<br>there's a similar thing going on culture<br>is being<br>forgotten and so we must um of course<br>it's very important we look at health um<br>our social well-being<br>and uh these factors are very important<br>part of that is housing<br>our buildings our communities and our<br>connectedness to those buildings<br>hasn't the pandemic showed us all about<br>the importance of social<br>connection and what happens when<br>we are required to not be so socially<br>connected<br>so in all of that when we're trying to<br>rebuild and come back and<br>regenerate reconnect from this<br>recent three months of effect of the<br>i felt that um gosh this is another<br>impact<br>on maori culture and<br>maori identity and belonging i wanted to<br>talk about<br>culture as the missing link here because<br>for my father<br>being born and raised here in the south<br>island<br>our connection to the place where he was<br>born which was on the banks peninsula is<br>goes back 21 generations not having<br>always lived there<br>but certainly um the little place at<br>little river on the banks peninsula<br>we've lived there since the 18 late<br>1800s<br>1868 be exact so that connection's<br>really important to me<br>and the same goes for my mum being<br>brought up<br>in a rural location on the par<br>where they've had to build their own<br>fare<br>and mirai and homes and so their<br>stories and what<br>was special about the essence and<br>vitality of their community<br>and homes is so significant so<br>just that's a little bit of an<br>introduction i hope<br>uh to this i'm going to share powerpoint<br>um photos mostly with you now<br>just wait for that to come on um and<br>talk about the essence of identity and<br>a culture um<br>i had it going before here we go<br>is that working yep<br>uh the essence of um culture<br>can begin with our whenua<br>and when we talk about manafinoa this is<br>a photo in north otago<br>where my ancestors or tupana<br>fled to just before tiropraha was coming<br>south to<br>um take his revenge for uh some attacks<br>on his<br>uh chieftainship and his relations<br>so we lived in for<br>a good 50 years manufa<br>or the the essence of the whenua and our<br>relationship with place<br>is so important we draw on the mountain<br>and the<br>background mapo or mapo<br>and there's a beautiful estuary that is<br>very significant to<br>the people who lived in that time<br>the next<br>essence and vitality that we're looking<br>at is when they returned<br>from north otago they<br>uh this is a photo of diamond harbor<br>where i lived<br>or littleton harbour looking out towards<br>the heads<br>next importance of our identity is the<br>moana<br>or the sea and the ocean<br>so mana moana is is uh<br>represents to us all of the<br>um resources uh the natural resources in<br>the water<br>along the coastline and uh the vitality<br>of those<br>is so uh essential to<br>our identity and belonging and<br>um littleton harbour<br>or the whole of the bank's peninsula has<br>been stripped of its forestry now but<br>back being in the 1860s it was<br>uh noted by those<br>who were coming in on the ships from<br>england from france that the din<br>and all of the harbours on the banks<br>peninsula was so noisy<br>uh the forest was steaming full of birds<br>so the bird song and chatter was just<br>uh absolutely vital and a wonderful<br>source of<br>place that we draw on is our<br>and this is a picture of it was drawn<br>from my mother<br>mother earth and um the moon<br>the marama the little picture there<br>we're really talking about the whole<br>cosmos and the energy<br>that we draw from the heavens from the<br>earth<br>from all of the heavenly bodies that are<br>so essential<br>to making us a part of the<br>not just where we stand but when we look<br>up into the heavens<br>and there we can see that's where most<br>people may<br>refer to as a term<br>we can refer to these as atua that's<br>where the actual word<br>means those things the unseen<br>the unseen things the intangible aspects<br>of our life<br>so is referred to as the gods but in<br>terms of how i was brought up<br>my mother was preferred to talk about<br>the unseen and the intangible<br>aspects of our life<br>um obviously that we draw<br>from the essence of human humanity<br>or manitoba from people um<br>and these are another central part of<br>what is vital about identity<br>and belonging so all of these concepts<br>are in nature<br>they're in places they're in ourselves<br>as human<br>how vital and healthy we feel how<br>connected we feel to all of those<br>aspects another part that<br>we start to go to next<br>is when we're looking at the concepts<br>of<br>the human reproductive system<br>but it also means sorry about that<br>um is the house of the people<br>it's the sacred spaces of creation<br>where humanity is created it's the four<br>corners of the universe<br>that structure that you can see there<br>with the trees<br>and what they have created a doorway a<br>window<br>a place for birds to<br>be a part of that structure all<br>is uh fronting or the bosch<br>all the living things created by tani<br>mahuta<br>another atawa and faritangata<br>is yes it symbolizes the womb our first<br>beginnings but it also symbolizes the<br>earth<br>and the sacred spaces of creation and if<br>we can imagine<br>us as humans as in my people my<br>ancestors<br>starting to draw on nature to create<br>structures<br>just as this artist did for my mother<br>when<br>she was trying to explain to him that<br>the forest<br>is a fuddy nature is a fadi<br>the universe is a so<br>that's a depiction of what is commonly<br>known in<br>maori knowledge or the house of the<br>people<br>but it's the house of the universe as<br>well<br>so all of these concepts bring us<br>to corridor about okay<br>let's construct a little kainga and<br>kaina<br>means home or the homestead<br>and in naito um the<br>kainga uh we replace the ng in that<br>wording<br>k a k i<br>with the k so we called our homes<br>kaika and all the kayak for short<br>and when i was a little girl um we had<br>the kayak at<br>akuro which is the harbour just over the<br>hill from this<br>picture of this little fare and we had<br>the kite<br>at otako and i thought the kayak was a<br>place<br>or kaika but actually kaika is the<br>homestead<br>so in sharing this photo with you<br>this little fare and there was a um<br>add-ons to the buddy which fell away and<br>it had a big<br>buy house but this little fatty still<br>stands at little river in banks<br>peninsula<br>and it um was<br>built probably in the late 1800s<br>my grandfather was born in 1889<br>and his parents managed to get some<br>finances and money to help to build a<br>fadi<br>and they built his parents my<br>great-grandparents<br>built a to house their children<br>they have five children and uh the<br>family and successive<br>or another generation my father's<br>generation lived there as well<br>that house still stands and like a lot<br>of our mirai<br>in um they stand<br>and i asked my mum<br>um why did they not pull the houses down<br>and why do some of our murdae look<br>like they really need a lot of work and<br>done to them and they've got lots of<br>cobwebs and the paints<br>falling away and she said well the old<br>people believe<br>that our homes and our houses sometimes<br>they need to die a natural death so<br>they let them stand in and just<br>die if once they've moved out and moved<br>on<br>this house was condemned in 1937<br>um after the native housing commissioner<br>went round it was still in good nick it<br>was built out of tortilla wood<br>all of the wood milled off the banks<br>peninsula<br>and uh<br>a native housing commissioner went to<br>all of the maori reserves around the<br>country<br>in the mid to late 1930s to<br>because they are concerned about poverty<br>on the reserves<br>and maybe their houses needed<br>improvements<br>so when the commissioner traveled to<br>our little reserve and little river on<br>the banks peninsula<br>on july the 17th 1937<br>there was no one home so he left a note<br>saying that given the state of the house<br>and he'd done a bit of research on<br>my family they felt it was not<br>economical<br>to loan our family money to<br>improve the fare and so they suggested<br>that<br>my father's family should move to<br>another reserve just<br>north of christchurch which was closer<br>to the city<br>and it would be more economical so<br>because of the poverty on the reserve at<br>little river<br>at wairiwa um the<br>many of the houses were condemned and<br>they still stand to this day<br>in this sorry state um<br>but we love our little fare and it's a<br>kaya that's very important to us<br>and while we can see the physical<br>structure and how dilapidated it<br>is and the cows get in there our hopes<br>are to<br>restore it and rebuild it<br>um so that our community and its<br>vitality<br>and the essence of having people live in<br>the community<br>um returns so our family are working on<br>plans to<br>improve our papa kanga um which is the<br>mirai<br>and the part area which there are about<br>30 40 houses<br>that are all still empty some have<br>actually completely fallen away<br>and been taken down but many still stand<br>in the state but if we go back<br>to these concepts of how would we want a<br>buddy<br>to be and and looking forward now<br>what will we draw on from our culture to<br>um rebuild and<br>we i want to have this corridor with you<br>now i suppose to start to share<br>how do we draw on these concepts of<br>um how do we make a a a fare or a kainga<br>a good place to occupy as human beings<br>obviously you need toilets<br>bathroom kitchen but what is the essence<br>that we're really trying to draw on<br>to help us to think about what's most<br>important to us in australia<br>so those are the things i sort of want<br>to start off with and if you have any<br>questions<br>please interrupt um and um<br>fire ahead um i'll take us off for<br>sharing<br>um and we can go back there<br>so any questions<br>well thank you very much murray that was<br>that was really beautiful<br>trying to get back to you all<br>okay i think we're getting better here<br>there we go<br>um<br>yeah okay so what i wanted to talk about<br>was in<br>in rebuilding and looking at arafat<br>what's really important to us is the<br>entrance<br>obviously and um how welcoming that<br>is and that it's a wide entrance<br>and even our um commercial buildings or<br>places where we are working the spaces<br>there become<br>really important and we're<br>we're looking at the moment at a um oh<br>yes there's some questions there<br>uh a building to um<br>for a clinic for a healers maori<br>traditional healers want a clinic<br>so we're talking about things like when<br>people come in<br>they bring their energy with them that<br>we've just talked about in their maori<br>their essence and vitality comes with<br>them<br>make sure that the fader is safe to<br>allow<br>all types of energy to come in and enter<br>and this is what happens when you enter<br>a meeting house<br>um you come in in peace<br>and you come in with the spirit<br>of uh wanting to engage and interact<br>we as the host bring our guests in and<br>we can't they come in peace<br>we introduce each other and welcome each<br>other<br>many maori homes there'll be a little<br>bit of a<br>i often used to go and visit people with<br>my parents as children<br>my dad would be welcomed by the head of<br>the house<br>of the hosts and he would reply so we<br>were having like this little mini<br>puffity inside the home and that would<br>be done in a certain part of the house<br>afterwards to acknowledge that you'd<br>come in as<br>tapu you go to food<br>part of the house to make everybody<br>gnaw or not tap so you can become part<br>of the household<br>all of these types of entrances and<br>doorways<br>and spaces um uh<br>are invisible to us just like the artura<br>but they're very real<br>to a maori home occupant<br>we've got two questions one one from<br>sophie<br>but sophie's audio may not be working do<br>you want to try for a sleepy<br>yeah kia ora can you hear me oh it's<br>working<br>gorgeous um i just wanted to it was<br>really beautiful my name's sophie jeremy<br>no it says<br>i'm the vogelmorn community center um i<br>killed her<br>i my sister lived in the river for a<br>while um<br>she's gone back to australia and my<br>brother is has a vineyard up in waitaki<br>valley so you're<br>you're yeah i'm i know what you are<br>and it's really nice yeah really i was<br>born in wanaka so i'm really connected<br>to where you are it's beautiful<br>um and i was interested in the<br>generational uh<br>gap you described the um that your<br>grandmother i think said that<br>she thought the decay was was the better<br>thing for the building and i missed the<br>point at which you said<br>um you decided you wanted to perhaps<br>restore it can you explain that a bit<br>more<br>1868 or with the naitahu<br>treaty negotiations uh the whole bank's<br>peninsula was negotiated and in return<br>for that<br>um maori who lived on the peninsula<br>were a lot of two reserves<br>which was little river akuro littleton<br>and a little bay just around the harbour<br>from littleton so four reserves were set<br>aside<br>of about 300 acres each so<br>in total um in return for the 50<br>000 hectares of the banks peninsula<br>maori were moved or agreed to move on to<br>these little reserves<br>that happened in 1868 and so<br>you're moving off a very traditional<br>style living<br>in small valleys and spread right across<br>the peninsula<br>onto reserve sites so they would build<br>paths<br>and with coming to a more modern<br>lifestyle<br>you would be loaned money<br>so you could build some houses and the<br>little reserve<br>and little river had um<br>150 or so uh people at what<br>in the start and each family was a lot<br>of<br>about we've got a 2.3 hectares<br>of land of the total reserve so there<br>might have been 14 or 15 families<br>and they each get their reserve and you<br>can build a little house there<br>so probably between 1868 and 1890<br>they would have been building the house<br>and then<br>my grandfather was born in 1889<br>so he lived there<br>so we had two generations um<br>uh coming from north otago<br>my great grandfather would have been<br>about 16 17<br>and he moved back to little river where<br>he had to show<br>ancestral connection to the native land<br>court<br>and he could to little river and he was<br>a lot of<br>those hectic through his mother's<br>um so he uh married into another family<br>from woman from little river and they<br>had their five children<br>and those children married a lot two<br>were girls<br>and others the brothers<br>all married into families from uh little<br>river<br>and my grandfather stayed in the house<br>with his wife and children<br>of which they had nine children in that<br>and so they had to build add-ons<br>they did build add-ons and um they had<br>an orchard on the property<br>then<br>danielle i'm sorry<br>sorry about that everybody so they did<br>live there for two generations<br>is very vital healthy full of business<br>there was a mirai<br>a little village they worked off lived<br>off the land<br>the milling that was happening in the<br>area by 1937<br>the um logging that was happening in<br>on the whole of the peninsula was<br>believed to have been a source of the<br>economy for at least 100 years it was<br>all gone in 30 years<br>so the economy was devastated<br>much sooner than and they had planned<br>for it to happen<br>so the native housing commissioners<br>moved around<br>all of the reserves in the country<br>because there was a lot of poverty<br>the economies had changed everywhere and<br>as little as<br>1868 to 1930s<br>that's 30 60 years um and so<br>many of the reserves are impoverished um<br>little river or whitey<br>was believed to the commissioners stated<br>it was the<br>most impoverished head witnessed out of<br>all of the<br>reserves people were living in kabul<br>boxes<br>it was mid-winter our home were quite<br>well off<br>and in relation to many other families<br>who also had large families<br>um coming to live in these little houses<br>so um those houses that weren't<br>deemed to be fit or economical to<br>improve<br>um were condemned and our house was<br>condemned<br>so that's my<br>dad's father or my grandfather and<br>stayed on in the house for eight years<br>so the experiences of<br>housing and uh issues like that going on<br>for maori have been<br>like the earthquakes are not new to us<br>in terms of what happened with zoning<br>down here at christchurch red zoning uh<br>not just on economic land but<br>uninhabitable<br>homes as well is not new for maori<br>so trying to rebuild back we we have to<br>look at<br>what is the essence and the vitality<br>about culture if we're to build<br>new houses new communities and some of<br>the options we get<br>they're pretty plain and and not really<br>our style i mean<br>you can see that little house it's not<br>really a house i mean we'd all love a<br>big<br>palatial mansion but when you walk into<br>the house<br>the entrance is straight into a lounge<br>there's a<br>two little bedrooms off to the side and<br>uh<br>the kitchen was the lane too that they<br>added on out the back<br>it was pretty basic so that's okay<br>if that's how you start but certainly as<br>our generations have gone on and i'll be<br>third generation from that buddy<br>we'd want to restore it just as it is<br>for heritage purposes<br>but um also we'd want to rebuild<br>and what would we want our house to be<br>like how<br>how the spaces in the party<br>how can we represent all of that<br>symbolism we talked about with our attua<br>the moana the closeness to the water<br>and it's so important and with ancestral<br>houses like marae meeting houses<br>they embody the ancestor<br>that it's named after so the houses have<br>arms they have eyes they have<br>a waha or a mouth which is the entrance<br>they have a long drive coming up<br>to it so that people coming on<br>to the are welcomed appropriately and we<br>know when they're coming<br>and how to welcome them so we try to<br>figure out<br>how can we use these concepts to excite<br>maori uh minds and communities and<br>families<br>to feel like their home is part of a hub<br>and um home is part of a park we call it<br>a par<br>a modern thing would be a hub i suppose<br>or a cluster<br>so in many meetings that we've had as<br>naito families<br>to think about home design<br>and community design little papa kainga<br>urban papaya<br>we're having these types of discussions<br>consider<br>the community as much as the house<br>itself<br>does that answer it sophie<br>absolutely<br>nigel you you had a question uh well<br>perhaps that the time is is late so i'll<br>talk later with you reagan about some<br>ideas<br>okay yeah well yes it is we're<br>we're sort of just over time um but<br>thank you very much mary for that<br>um you know that sort of presentation we<br>don't often get ones that really strike<br>to the heart like yours just did<br>so it's marvelous and thank you very<br>much in the usual way</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
