However once printed the digital information that defined them is unable to be updated and changed, effectively locking the data.<br><br>Ross will briefly explain his research into 3D printed digital chameleons that can be re programmed allowing them to be continuously transformed and updated. He proposes to achieve this by encapsulating thin film displays (OLED) inside the prints. This hybrid process will combine the dynamic capabilities of screens with the 3 dimensional qualities of printing.<br><br>His research is supported by the MADE (Multi-property Additive manufactured Design Experiments) research DRIL. The presentation is a chance for colleagues to learn about the state of the art 3D printer (Stratasys J 750) we have at the Te Aro campus and perhaps ways they could use it.<br><br>The Wellington

i thought i'd start today i'm<br>i'm going to effectively talk about some<br>cutting edge technology at the end<br>that's where i'm kind of going to get to<br>but i thought i'd start with a little<br>bit of history<br>because i'm an industrial designer and i<br>think i hope a lot of the people coming<br>in today won't<br>know that much about industrial design<br>it might be just the topic they've heard<br>of that they're not experts in<br>so i thought i'd start a little bit with<br>where i think industrial design came<br>from<br>and for me industrial design really came<br>out of these things<br>so the thing on the chair is is a<br>molding tool<br>so you can't really get the gravity of<br>how heavy it is<br>except that poor chair let me tell you<br>wants to have a person sit on it at this<br>point<br>not this tool i got the tool off a<br>person then i swapped it for a concrete<br>block<br>because they were using it as a door<br>stop and i said to the guy it's a bit<br>heavy as a doorstep and he said yeah<br>and i said i'll get you a concrete block<br>and we'll do a swap huh<br>and that for me is where industrial<br>design came from because to build that<br>tool would be<br>somewhere between forty and fifty<br>thousand dollars<br>but the problem is if the thing it makes<br>nobody wants<br>it's worth less than a concrete block<br>and so i think that's where my<br>profession actually came from that<br>once we decided to mass tool things i<br>think industry decided it was worth<br>giving a few dollars<br>to somebody that had a better chance<br>more people would want to buy the<br>product<br>even louder okay yeah well good do a bit<br>of yelling<br>um so if that's where the the profession<br>came from this idea that<br>we're going to mass tool this we're<br>going to spend enormous amounts of money<br>and once we've told it we can't change<br>it ever<br>i think it makes sense to go what's most<br>likely to sell<br>and that's where industrial design's a<br>bit different to other professions i<br>think<br>if you've got a product that isn't<br>competitive in the market<br>you literally can't give them away it's<br>different to a building where even a<br>crappy building you can rent to students<br>you can't do that with bad products<br>so i think that's where we came from and<br>one of my questions now is what do we do<br>now<br>because i think things are changing and<br>what i'm going to show today is a few of<br>the changes coming<br>so this one was fixed you had to sell<br>many of them<br>a tool like that you would hope to sell<br>a million parts off<br>and that again was a huge problem for<br>new zealand<br>because we only had probably a million<br>people when that tool was made maybe two<br>so every second person had to buy your<br>pot lid<br>because that's what that did was a piece<br>of a pot not the total pot just a little<br>piece of the lid<br>so i think that was really problematic<br>for new zealand we didn't suit mass<br>production but we wanted to<br>so we set up a whole bunch of structures<br>so we'd mass produce products<br>problem is we didn't have mass customers<br>so when i graduated i studied at the<br>wellington polytech<br>graduated in 1986<br>good year there was four of us graduated<br>it was great<br>and in 1987 we had the share market<br>crash<br>and in all of the talks i'd been to it<br>was a polytech i'd been taught a lot<br>about how<br>to make products but never once the<br>context of what i was going to be making<br>them in the world i'd be making them in<br>so i came out of polytech fully<br>understanding how to make things all<br>fairly well<br>but no idea of the environment the<br>political environment the economic<br>environment i was about to hit<br>and i had the share market crash and at<br>that time i<br>saw manufacturers just flock out of the<br>country<br>so i saw most of my friends get fired<br>and i saw most of the production move to<br>asia<br>and at that time i thought oh bugger<br>that that's no fun i don't want to do<br>that<br>so i thought i'll go to europe and i'll<br>get a job there because they're bigger<br>and cooler<br>and i watched exactly the same thing<br>happen in europe<br>and i thought okay this is complex so<br>then i came back to new zealand i<br>thought okay if we're<br>we don't suit mass production what do we<br>suit<br>and so for a long time we were not sure<br>of that<br>but at the same time we split the<br>schools<br>so the wellington polytech and victoria<br>university built this campus<br>as a shared facility which not many<br>people really understand that's why it's<br>between<br>what was the polytech and what was the<br>main university<br>this is neutral territory so the theory<br>went<br>then massey ended up with the polytech<br>and the big divorce happened and it was<br>just pretty for long<br>but what happened then was there was two<br>industrial design programs in wellington<br>so one of them went and or one stayed<br>with conventional tooling<br>a conventional understanding of<br>industrial design and in effect we<br>decided to go for<br>a future vision of what it might be<br>because to be fair we couldn't really<br>see the future of traditional<br>approaches so this would be a classic<br>example of i think what's different now<br>so this is a<br>3d print it's designed the way i like to<br>design it took eight minutes<br>playing with little sliders unwinding a<br>shell which was a template i was given<br>i don't even know if i like it but i<br>think it's interesting it has a left and<br>a right<br>and to get a left and a right mirror set<br>you push<br>mirror and it goes plop and then you<br>have a complete mirror it's that fast<br>so eight minutes the beauty of an eight<br>minute design is if you don't like it<br>you haven't lost much time i bought it<br>in and one of my colleagues<br>i was showing off how cool it was and<br>one said oh i think it's ugly<br>and i was and that's when it hit me<br>actually i didn't design this thing<br>the computer did because it didn't hurt<br>normally if a colleague that i respect<br>says something<br>sucks it hurts didn't hurt at all<br>found straight off and i thought well<br>why am i prepared to take the praise if<br>people like it<br>it's that's not right and then one of my<br>other colleagues who's very cheeky came<br>up and he said ross it's brilliant i<br>actually really like it except<br>i've got an issue with the head part and<br>i'm like well what is it<br>he said it looks like my togs the lining<br>in my togs<br>and once he said that he was bang on<br>because it's got little toggles and<br>everything<br>so you can see little there's little<br>toggles under here<br>but the reason i did that is what i love<br>about this product<br>is it's not fix tooled i can change it<br>by changing the digital file just like<br>that<br>i spent eight minutes on it instead of<br>eight years<br>seriously they spent seven years<br>figuring out the smart drive<br>washing machine that was my first job<br>eight minutes is much cooler<br>but if i don't like it i can also put it<br>through a grinder and i can get this<br>material back<br>again and i can make more filament and i<br>can reprint with it<br>so the beauty of this is it's actually<br>made out of old coke bottles<br>the filament is recycled filament so<br>it really takes a lot of the onus on the<br>designer to be absolutely sure they can<br>sell a million of something<br>i can make a one-off really unique<br>version no problem at all<br>the recycling side fascinates me about<br>printing but it's not the thing i've<br>spent most of my time on<br>so the side of printing that i do is<br>much more precise multi-material<br>printing<br>so if you think of this one the way this<br>process works it's like a hot melt glue<br>gun and you just go around that<br>a computer controls it and puts down the<br>plastic where you want it<br>the type i do is more like a spray gun<br>or a spray can<br>but the part that's complex in the spray<br>can is every droplet when you push the<br>trigger<br>i can digitally program where it goes<br>so if you look at something like that<br>that has about half a million spray<br>droplets in it<br>and with a computer i can precisely put<br>every droplet exactly where i want it<br>to be i couldn't master students could<br>like<br>so this is a sample that was done by mit<br>and they use generative software to<br>create it<br>and there is literally half a billion<br>programmable droplets in there so the<br>problem with half a billion programmable<br>droplets is<br>geez that's longer than a washing<br>machine to do<br>so that's when you need to start using<br>things like artificial intelligence and<br>machine learning<br>because humans won't be able to tell<br>this thing exactly what to do<br>there's just too much information so<br>where my research sits<br>is in effect screen based technology so<br>where you can see the screen with all<br>its pixels in it<br>i'm kind of jealous of screens as an<br>industrial designer i make objects<br>and if you look where all the money's<br>gone in the recent few years<br>it's gone towards screen based<br>businesses youtube<br>you know businesses that don't really<br>exist these<br>online things that are very not very<br>tangible from a physical object point of<br>view<br>so what i'm trying to do is get some of<br>the power of the screen based industry<br>and pull it into the 3d<br>tangible object industrial design world<br>so this is a prosthetic that was<br>designed to exactly fit my hand<br>so it's designed for the film industry<br>so they could get a scan of<br>a famous actor they can do that from<br>anywhere in the world<br>bring the scan here and then they can<br>print prosthetics so when they turn up<br>it's already<br>perfectly fitting them so i'll show you<br>that too<br>so you can see the little line in my<br>this is a sample our technician down in<br>the<br>downstairs where this 3d printer is<br>printed in its chain mail<br>but he can print any color any pattern<br>he wants into that<br>the only challenge really is feeding it<br>an intelligent<br>file smart enough for the machine for<br>the first time i think in history we<br>have machines that can print at a higher<br>resolution than we can see them fast<br>it's kind of trippy yes you can<br>but don't pull it the rule with all this<br>stuff is assume it's alive and you're<br>going to try and kill it so if you look<br>at<br>something like this one of the things<br>that intrigues me is<br>if you look at a cad file it's got a<br>certain quality to it and a certain<br>complexity but when you print this stuff<br>so i'll give you a bit of a zoom on this<br>one<br>see the way it yields is actually the<br>this is really the life i think it has<br>and it's what i'm trying to do when i<br>design is figure out okay<br>when it comes off the printer that's<br>fascinating but then what does it do<br>i'm trying to make the james dean of of<br>prince<br>but you know some actors supposedly are<br>really boring people when you meet them<br>but you put a camera on them and they<br>come to life that's the type of printing<br>i'm trying to do<br>so if you look at this this is a project<br>done by weta workshop one of our<br>graduates that works there<br>so one of the things they found it<br>perfect for is doing<br>eyes so photorealistic eyes<br>the beauty of that is it means once they<br>have this file they can do things like<br>scale it<br>change eye color one of the ideas i<br>thought would be cool for an exhibition<br>is when you walk into it somebody could<br>photograph your eye<br>and then instantly change all the eyes<br>in the exhibition to your color<br>creepy but i like quite like creepy<br>creepy's quite good that means you can<br>also make them much bigger<br>you know you have the fluidity of the<br>digital world but one thing that<br>did slightly bore me with this it made<br>me start to realize the problem with<br>this type of printing<br>yes it's the same precision as a screen<br>yes it's 3d which is great<br>but once it's printed it's locked<br>and the locking of that data i think's<br>a way it doesn't compete with screens so<br>the beauty of these screens we look at<br>them and you can see the little droplets<br>in them<br>you know if i move every one of those<br>little pixels is turning off and on<br>it's immensely powerful and<br>here we're stacking those layers instead<br>of making a film<br>so film is a whole bunch of stills you<br>put together we are stacking them to<br>make it 3d<br>but what i want is i want this to be<br>able to come to life again<br>so the research i'm looking at is trying<br>to figure out how to embed screens<br>inside prints so part of the data is<br>locked and it's three-dimensional but<br>part of the data is fluid<br>in semi-2 3d<br>are flexible screen displays so these<br>ones are just<br>backlit ones my research that was that's<br>going through this year<br>was supposed to be working with huawei<br>and stratasys the 3d printmakers<br>so you can imagine how that research and<br>their secret r d labs is going<br>um so at the moment i'm having to<br>simulate it with other types of display<br>technology<br>but the theory is it's a 3d print which<br>gives its three-dimensional qualities<br>and potentially some of its color<br>and then it's a thin film display<br>which can be 4k resolution<br>put into effectively no object at all<br>and i think what i'm trying to develop<br>is objects that almost have a function<br>but don't exist<br>they like this thing the little clouds<br>that are physical<br>but at the end of your life you could<br>throw it out without any real guilt or<br>any real thought<br>because it's more like the leaf of a<br>tree that falls down an autumn<br>there's so little on it and we know so<br>well how to reclaim the materials<br>it can be temporary and disposable<br>so yeah digital technology fused into 3d<br>printing<br>here's an example where i'm trying to<br>take the displays one of the challenges<br>is the displays are hard to bend<br>if you're really good at origami you're<br>really good at breaking displays<br>because they can't do sharp crests so<br>this one has a helical<br>display wound through it so i've just<br>got to understand that sort of<br>technology<br>and this is one that i had printed this<br>morning these are the sort of colors we<br>get to with the printer we have the<br>printer we have downstairs is about<br>three quarters of a million dollars<br>worth<br>but it will do full color it will do<br>full translucency<br>down to millions of variants and it will<br>also do full hardness control<br>so you just spoil for what you can do<br>it's really hard to give it a worthwhile<br>challenge<br>but this is the print i got this morning<br>which i'm now going to form<br>so this is starting to get a bit bigger<br>and again you can<br>how many decisions can you make this<br>one's got 150 decisions in it which is<br>the simplest thing in the world<br>but every one of those little lines of<br>color<br>could have been millions of different<br>things between the color<br>selection and the translucency selection<br>i've literally got<br>millions of variants so anyway so i<br>might leave it there because<br>maybe ask people a few questions<br>no this is evil yeah so this is heavy<br>happy and nice and you know what a<br>lovely world it's all great<br>this is evil this is a type of reason<br>that<br>is cured with uv light and once it's<br>cured you can't use it again<br>but having said that what interests me<br>in this technology is using a machine<br>that can place<br>materials down to microns<br>and then what materials we feed through<br>it later is up to us<br>i would love to see us feeding um cells<br>into it<br>so we can do biopolymers and we can do<br>living tissue<br>because when you if you want to do a<br>piece of living tissue you have to do<br>multiple materials<br>if it's useful a heart isn't one<br>material it's many<br>so i see this is how we connect<br>artificial intelligence machine learning<br>and physical outputs at the resolution<br>of<br>the natural world which is nanoscale<br>we've got a little way to go yet but<br>we're certainly starting to see the<br>evil all right so there any<br>if there are questions how would we know<br>oh have you got any questions<br>you can have a false question i'll i'll<br>try a false question okay<br>um i'm i tutored briefly last year<br>last year on the design and i saw a lot<br>of um design school and i<br>saw a lot of people excited about um<br>that printer in the basement um<br>is it possible for it to be applied to<br>other kinds of fabric or are we still<br>just dealing with<br>that plastic this machine's all about<br>plastics because it's a very particular<br>polymer<br>we call it multi-property printing but<br>it's actually all the same polymer<br>it's an epoxy a uv cured epoxy but it<br>can be transparent soft or hard<br>so at the moment no it is just one<br>material<br>do you see the potential for it to start<br>incorporating other materials i'm<br>thinking of<br>you know wools and and um<br>wood products and no no no<br>no the only reason with this one is it's<br>all liquid-based<br>okay but this one literally is your<br>spray can<br>but has to start with a liquid because<br>it does literally spray the ink on like<br>an inkjet printer<br>this type the more um hot melt glue gun<br>type<br>absolutely can look at multiple<br>properties blended within it<br>the problem with that type though is<br>it's very difficult to get multiple<br>types of materials into that process<br>because you've got one filament feeding<br>in<br>so i think 3d printing people think of<br>it as one big homogenous thing<br>that's all the same and each process has<br>its strengths and each process has its<br>weaknesses<br>and part of i think learning the craft<br>for printing is knowing when to use<br>each one but part of it's also i think a<br>little bit if you<br>if you think something's missing<br>something there's nothing to stop you<br>advancing it in this particular field we<br>probably have the biggest research group<br>in the world doing<br>multi-property color work so the company<br>that make the printers<br>rate us is probably the number one skill<br>mit are very good<br>but they have a lot of diverse research<br>we're one of the few that are focused on<br>polyjet<br>thanks<br>because part of my belief is we've got<br>to get inside the secret labs<br>because the secret labs are five years<br>ahead of what you see out in the<br>retail world and if we want to be true<br>leaders and i think kiwis<br>we're just so certainly we're all<br>leaders or we've disengaged<br>personally you know that pioneering<br>spirit is still there we're going places<br>people haven't been<br>i think we love that space so the<br>research and development labs<br>i think they really suit our character<br>the one place they don't suit our<br>character is we cheat<br>so we don't have the investment sort of<br>capital that other countries do have<br>so they can build amazing research labs<br>but they really struggle to be<br>innovative<br>and that is a place i think he was just<br>thrived<br>i mean imagine being poor all your life<br>so i spent a lot of time with industry<br>trying to figure out how to get inside<br>it<br>of course yeah hey there's a lot of your<br>machine learning and algorithm based<br>research<br>to do with the end user products being<br>quite tough to find data presets and<br>stuff because i know that<br>a lot of that machine learning<br>algorithm-based stuff relies on dataset<br>is getting files to the printer<br>that are worthy of the printer and what<br>a strange problem<br>that it could print so much more than we<br>can<br>as an example of this claw it's quite<br>clever in the way it fits my hand<br>but when i try and flex it it won't flex<br>because around the knuckles it's the<br>wrong hardness and it doesn't change<br>thickness and shape but it would happily<br>print whatever we wanted we just can't<br>send it a file complex enough<br>so it's a time when the software is<br>actually behind the hardware and that's<br>quite unusual<br>so we need to ally ourselves with quite<br>different people<br>that know how to get software to do<br>things that's never done<br>yeah which is quite a neat time actually<br>that we get other people we can<br>can you just go through maybe some of<br>the prints and explain like the printing<br>cost<br>yeah okay so what we have is is<br>probably not too expensive i i would<br>it's old coke bottle so if you<br>if you have coke bottles you probably<br>all got a few coke bottles<br>if you had a machine capable of refining<br>it and turning it into polymer you could<br>effectively get that<br>pretty much free because at the moment<br>we're probably paying people to take<br>away<br>coke bottles there is the refining<br>process but that could be done<br>locally quite easily so potentially<br>that's a very cost effective process<br>um i personally would love to print<br>houses because<br>it's not that hard and it's just bug and<br>mean no one is<br>the world's biggest fdm printer which is<br>that type's called cadzilla<br>and it's made by the australians and<br>they're not the world's best engineers<br>so<br>so they're owning that and we we could<br>own that too<br>but that would probably be biopolymers<br>so there will be things like pine trees<br>and pine resin which again we can do<br>once you get into this stuff it gets<br>scary but only because it's pretty<br>rarefied and not many people are doing<br>it<br>if we're the biggest program in the<br>world researching it it gives you an<br>idea of<br>how many people are using this tech this<br>is a two billion dollar company that<br>make this that have no idea what this<br>machine's for<br>i don't know how they stay in business<br>but um so that is an example cost me 430<br>to print but just to give you some idea<br>of<br>i'm now going to try and turn that into<br>a curve so i'm going to heat it up and<br>try not to break it<br>but if i printed that shape to say that<br>flat cost me<br>forty dollars to print if i printed it<br>vertically like that in a curve<br>it would be two hundred so there's a lot<br>of ways to actually work with these<br>printers to get them really<br>happy and to get cost out<br>so as i say that's the thing about 3d<br>printing lots of different approaches<br>and lots of different things it can do<br>but that's part of learning the craft i<br>think something like an eye<br>as an example weta did that because it<br>saves them money<br>so when they used to custom make eyes<br>they'd do it with little bits of wool<br>and stuff<br>but the problem with that is only one<br>five eyes were acceptable<br>so they'd throw four of them out and<br>that's production<br>facilities best eye makers in the world<br>so richard taylor what he did was he<br>took the best eyes that you get from an<br>american company<br>and the the threshold was our these eyes<br>had to be as good<br>the beauty of this is every one of them<br>is perfect<br>go for it yeah oh zach yeah zack those<br>heaps of stuff exactly<br>this one can you hear me yep<br>yeah so if you don't mind i'm gonna<br>share my screen because i've got<br>um the software that we're working on<br>uh up at the moment this is just a basic<br>example if we<br>um have a look at like the main model<br>that's going in it's this kind of<br>um just uh<br>kind of standard model inside the<br>software called houdini it's kind of a<br>test<br>uh test geometry um<br>and then we have the the voxelization<br>process<br>happening within a kind of<br>a big network of nodes here um finally<br>writing that<br>out to cmyk color so<br>we're actually able to define every<br>single<br>voxels position in space<br>and able to pass it through processes<br>that that<br>are able to quantize the color dependent<br>on the depth and dependent on the<br>surrounding colors as well so<br>we're pretty close to having a<br>reasonably<br>uh yeah a reasonably good piece of<br>software that can um you know that can<br>actually translate a lot of<br>a lot of kind of traditional traditional<br>modeling techniques which are kind of<br>uh surface-based modeling and color uh<br>color painting on the surface and we can<br>translate those into<br>uh more kind of heterogeneous models<br>that actually<br>have defined can i just ask you a couple<br>of questions i don't know if you can<br>hear<br>because who's got the audio but just who<br>are you first just so the other people<br>understand<br>where their comments coming from of that<br>knowledge i just gate crashed man i'm<br>just some random<br>it's not that simple zack you know<br>you've got some relationship to us<br>so explain who you are a little bit in<br>the context of victoria<br>yeah no so i'm i'm uh i'm one of ross's<br>phd students<br>um having a look at like<br>at the at that micro scale how we<br>actually go in<br>and and define points of<br>color but more importantly i think going<br>along with what was saying<br>what ross was saying before like points<br>of uh<br>or locations in space throughout a<br>heterogeneous volume<br>so that's a that's a volume that has um<br>material variation within its you know<br>within its kind of<br>almost molecular structure rather than<br>just being<br>so the software you're using is that<br>software that you got off the internet<br>uh you you have to pay for houdini and<br>the funny thing about it<br>is that it's not a cad software<br>it's a vfx software so the tools that<br>we're using these these voxel<br>vdbs the voxel databases they're<br>actually used to<br>create visual effects like water like uh<br>in in films and<br>video games water smoke effects particle<br>effects<br>um to create fields and conditions<br>within fields<br>so how many other groups in the world<br>could do this that you know of<br>uh i don't know anybody who has this<br>piece of software because we've<br>developed it internally thanks to<br>one of our ex staff members ben jack<br>at the level we're at it's quite unusual<br>for new zealand to be a world leader and<br>a really<br>significant piece of emerging technology<br>and it's taken us many years to get here<br>we bought our first machine in 2005<br>but it's just great to see students<br>doing work and they know anywhere else<br>in the world<br>they're ahead you know they'll go to a<br>conference and people will look at them<br>and<br>prep themselves because they know our<br>students know how to do stuff they don't<br>know how to do<br>um it's pretty exciting and as i say for<br>pioneering new zealand i think it suits<br>us well<br>i thought i thought that would just be a<br>nice little uh kind of<br>view of where we're at in terms of the<br>actual software and<br>and being able to define those internal<br>conditions<br>i could have picked a meanest question<br>already but um<br>i don't know to be honest honest i'm not<br>sure of the epoxy because they don't<br>tell us anything about it<br>that's secret stuff um i know it's evil<br>and that is one of the trade-offs using<br>it<br>the only counter balance to being evil<br>is it's really expensive so it's a small<br>amount of evil because no one's going to<br>print a lot with it<br>and it's it's for me a bit of a holding<br>pattern we just haven't got the<br>technology to get that right<br>the requirement to make it<br>environmentally better understood<br>we'll make sure it becomes that it will<br>have to<br>so for me that's why this is small scale<br>stuff<br>but when we start talking the<br>biopolymers and we start talking<br>plant-based oils<br>that's when the scale goes up and that's<br>when that questions importance goes up<br>and for me i'm not that interested in<br>printing a house i'm really interested<br>in unprinting the house<br>because i actually think construction's<br>the easy bit it's deconstruction that we<br>haven't understood at all<br>and the funny thing is we do so much<br>work to construct the house<br>and that work is the very thing that<br>makes it difficult to deconstruct so<br>every time you put a screw into a wall<br>and then you cover over it so you don't<br>know where they are you did a lot of<br>work to make it so we can't pull it<br>apart<br>so i see that we'll print mono material<br>houses<br>out of very low toxin materials and<br>fully recyclable<br>in fact i want to grind them a great big<br>industrial grinder<br>it's like shredding a pencil or<br>something<br>but ross the reality is that epoxis for<br>example you'll have<br>something like um 70 80 of them are<br>using<br>bpa which is endocrine disturber as the<br>main component<br>and then they use some solvents in order<br>to harden it it's a two component system<br>so one of the components normally<br>is actually highly harmful and uh<br>two component system which means that<br>your handling or somebody on site is<br>handling<br>one of the highly problematic substances<br>more or less in a rowish<br>ingredient stage so it's quite a<br>you know like we can't ignore and you<br>know that's my view we can't ignore some<br>of the fine prints<br>uh which are filtering into everything<br>that we're doing yeah<br>and i think that's really valid but<br>there's a huge difference between this<br>process<br>which is uv cured the trick with it i<br>mean there's basically two types of<br>plastics in the world there's a type<br>that if you heat up it turns back to<br>plastic<br>and it's soft and the tide if you heat<br>up it turns to flames<br>and it doesn't change shape so this is a<br>thermoset<br>so that means when you heat it up it<br>turns to flames<br>because it's chemically bonded and a<br>thermoform which is this type<br>potentially you can keep heating up<br>returning it to plastic and changing its<br>shape<br>so the one we need to do a lot of work<br>with to make larger scale things is the<br>thermal forms<br>because the way the molecules are bonded<br>is completely different<br>and that one can be hugely recycled and<br>hugely lower in toxins<br>because it's a much simpler molecule the<br>uv cured stuff<br>i don't think that's how that process is<br>going to be used large scale<br>one for cost but the other one you're<br>right for environmental problems<br>i'd never live in a building that was<br>made of uv cured resin<br>i think it's highly likely i'd happily<br>live in a building that was made of<br>plant oil and plant flour<br>yeah at the moment the company that are<br>making this machine as an example<br>they have so many challenges i think<br>that one would cook them<br>and the only reason i think this<br>validity in this process is<br>because it does control every little<br>molecule on every little particle<br>which in like keeps it in line with<br>artificial intelligence and its<br>capability<br>so we can make much much more<br>sophisticated objects<br>at the moment they're still figuring how<br>to do that even how to get the software<br>to talk to the hardware they don't know<br>that bit yet so to add to it the<br>complexity of a recyclable material<br>would just stall them but the long-term<br>future is definitely going to have to<br>resolve that before that has any level<br>of scale<br>whereas this process there's huge<br>amounts of work going into that already<br>and and we're seeing that already that<br>recycled material is becoming quite<br>common for<br>the hot melt glue gun type printers<br>just at different stages of their<br>evolution i think<br>the saving grace here is to say is when<br>it's 50 bucks to make something that big</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
