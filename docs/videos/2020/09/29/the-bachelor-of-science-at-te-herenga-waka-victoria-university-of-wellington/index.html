Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree at Te Herenga Waka–Victoria University of Wellington. <br><br>For more information on the degree, see <br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/explore/degrees/science/overview <br>or<br>www.wgtn.ac.nz/science</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>do you ever look at the world and think<br>things could be improved somewhat do you<br>know how we improve things somewhat<br>science that's right science science is<br>what drives humanity into the future<br>and you could be a part of it when you<br>study science at victoria university of<br>wellington<br>you're learning from top minds and top<br>facilities on top of the science capital<br>of new zealand<br>so where's your passion going to take<br>you are you into biology the living<br>world<br>animals and bees and wasps maybe no<br>wasps<br>we're right slap bang on one of the most<br>ecologically diverse areas of the<br>country<br>right slap next to zalandia eco<br>sanctuary and right slap across town<br>from the coastal ecology laboratory and<br>victoria university of wellington<br>students study them all<br>from trees to seas but biology isn't<br>just about trees and animals and nature<br>it's also about looking inside ourselves<br>genetics cells gut bacteria they're all<br>there and you could use them to find<br>medicines and protect fisheries or just<br>generally save the world<br>like gravity you can't escape physics<br>but if you love physics<br>why would you want to we've got<br>physicists astrophysicists and<br>theoretical physicists<br>working on exciting new nano materials<br>the composition of our galaxy<br>we're shooting lasers at solar panels<br>and taking photos of the electricity<br>there's no denying that there's a global<br>need for clean energy<br>that that's affordable and when you look<br>up at the sun<br>there's as much energy from the sun in<br>just one hour as the entire world<br>consumes in a year so there's<br>essentially unlimited<br>resource there and it comes down to<br>using technology<br>to convert that energy in the sun into a<br>most usable form of energy<br>electricity and that's where a solar<br>photovoltaic is the key<br>when you look at existing technology<br>solar photovoltaics are made from<br>silicon they're still<br>essentially made of a glass-like thing<br>and we're looking at<br>making them out of very low cost<br>materials plastics actually<br>and the plastic is also known as a<br>polymer<br>and we're working with materials called<br>semiconducting polymers<br>that can fulfill all of the roles of<br>silicon<br>but they can be printed and they can be<br>manufactured therefore very very cheaply<br>these polymer solar cells essentially<br>just look like<br>a flexible film of plastic and they<br>could be used in a number of ways<br>they could sit on top of your rooftop<br>just like an existing solar panel does<br>but because they're lightweight and<br>flexible they could be used in outdoor<br>equipment and tents and things like that<br>you could have a little<br>flexible lightweight charger for your<br>phone when you're out and about<br>they could be on walls of houses we<br>could make semi-transparent films<br>that coat windows that absorb let's say<br>half the sunlight instead of tinting the<br>window and turn that sunlight into<br>electricity<br>but that's not all that chemistry can do<br>chemists take the building blocks of our<br>universe and<br>build stuff with them like antimicrobial<br>resin or gold infused wool<br>or medicines that can give a new quality<br>of life to millions<br>or using iron particles to remove<br>nitrogen from our waterways<br>speaking of our environment we need our<br>environment and our environment needs<br>passionate people like you<br>scientists who can understand our rocks<br>our soil our air our water<br>so much water and we're only several<br>thousand stones throw away from the<br>antarctic which is why we've got the<br>antarctic research center<br>right here on campus the reason for<br>studying the ice sheet and understanding<br>what it's doing<br>is so that we can better predict sea<br>level rise both globally and for new<br>zealand<br>if we're going to be prepared for and<br>plan for what's coming in the future<br>with sea level rise and how new zealand<br>must adapt to it you know<br>this this is where the rubber hits the<br>road this is where our research<br>is having a direct impact on planning<br>and decision making and making new<br>zealand resilient to climate change<br>we have many colleagues around the world<br>who look at us with envy and go<br>how did you guys in new zealand a small<br>country of four and a half million<br>people<br>put together such a functional<br>world-class<br>team all of us just get such a kick<br>out of being part of that environment<br>and with our international collaborators<br>and that we can make a difference for<br>new zealand<br>and we make a difference on the world<br>we've got data too much data but with a<br>little maths and statistics we can make<br>sense of<br>all of that and with a lot of maths and<br>statistics we can make sense of the<br>universe itself<br>did you know that a degree in statistics<br>is the most sought after qualification<br>in the world<br>that's what our statistics tell us you<br>could work in economics genomics<br>astronautics or<br>actuarial science that's risk assessment<br>my research is in tangles and they're a<br>mathematically robust way to identify<br>communities within big data sets<br>so this is a very relevant problem today<br>lots of companies have massive data sets<br>that they want to understand<br>and if we can find an efficient and<br>accurate way to do that that can be<br>really valuable<br>i never intended to study maths growing<br>up<br>music and art were my main passions and<br>i came here to study music<br>but i was persuaded to do a first-year<br>mass paper by my dad who<br>studied maths and computer science and i<br>did it i did math 161<br>it's a really cool paper and you should<br>do it because i'll be teaching it but<br>it was the first time that i really saw<br>the creative side of maths and it's<br>completely different to what you see at<br>school<br>school is very much focused on following<br>rules solving equations it's really<br>boring stuff and i didn't like it i see<br>why people don't like maths<br>but maths is really about patterns it's<br>about understanding them<br>uh describing them to other people in a<br>beautiful way and also creating them<br>yourself and that's no different to any<br>other art form so that's really when i<br>realised<br>the beauty in maths and why it changed<br>over to a maths degree<br>what if you're a people person with an<br>interest in psychology well you could be<br>a health professional<br>a neuroscientist an animal behavioralist<br>or work in pretty much any field that<br>involves people<br>so many people we're the only university<br>in the country with a centre for<br>cross-cultural psychology and for<br>forensic psychology giving you a huge<br>number of ways to make a difference in<br>the lives of others<br>let's face facts science is one of the<br>best things humanity does and we need<br>scientists<br>no matter which subject you're<br>passionate about you'll have a chance to<br>make your mark on the world as a science<br>graduate<br>and victoria university of wellington is<br>here to give you the skills<br>and expertise you'll need to make that<br>mark as big as you can</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
