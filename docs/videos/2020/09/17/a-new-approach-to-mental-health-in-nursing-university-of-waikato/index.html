Thanks in large part to Tony’s contribution, the degree will be a significant departure from traditional approaches, with the Waikato programme recognising the need to take a more holistic view of a person and their life when providing nursing services.<br><br>Read the full story here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-opinion/media/2020/a-new-approach-to-mental-health-in-nursing <br><br>Find out about the Bachelor of Nursing here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/campaigns/nursing/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>(birds chirping)<br>- So at a policy level in mental health,<br>we have a national report<br>the He Ara Oranga report,<br>which was produced in 2018.<br>That followed a long<br>inquiry into mental health<br>and addiction in New Zealand.<br>And that report has laid the basis for,<br>significant development in mental health<br>and addiction in New Zealand<br>over the next few years.<br>So in the Waikato, we have<br>particular challenges,<br>around the rural nature of a<br>good number of the population.<br>We also have a very high Māori population.<br>The highest number of Māori,<br>of any DHB population in New Zealand,<br>and we have to be able to<br>provide mental health care;<br>close to people's homes and communities<br>so that mental health care<br>is accessible to them.<br>So nurses play a critical<br>role in providing,<br>mental health care throughout New Zealand,<br>not just in mental health services<br>but in primary care in a<br>range of other settings,<br>like corrections, schools,<br>ACC and other settings.<br>So nurses make up the largest proportion,<br>of the health professional workforce<br>and are in a key position<br>to make a difference,<br>of mental health, in terms<br>of early intervention<br>and responses,<br>before people need the intervention<br>of specialist services.<br>So we're really excited,<br>to be offering this new nursing programme,<br>at the University of Waikato<br>and the approach that we've<br>taken to mental health,<br>is that mental health,<br>is going to be integrated<br>into the programme.<br>Throughout the three years,<br>we won't be teaching mental health,<br>as a standalone module<br>within the programme,<br>we'll be teaching it<br>and every clinical course in the programme<br>and in every theoretical course.<br>That we think that will<br>be much more effective,<br>in helping nurses to develop skills<br>and competence in mental health<br>that they can use in<br>every clinical setting,<br>not just in specialist<br>mental health settings.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
