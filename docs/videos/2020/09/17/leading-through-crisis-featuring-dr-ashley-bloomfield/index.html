But there have also been many cases where leaders have not effectively managed a crisis—leading to dire results.<br><br>So, what does effective leadership through a crisis looks like and what can be learned from the COVID-19 experience and other crises? <br><br>Professor Ian Williamson, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Wellington School of Business and Government, hosted a panel discussion in September 2020 with local experts, including Dr Bloomfield, to talk about leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic, and other crises. <br><br>Panelists<br><br>Dr. Ashley Bloomfield—Director-General and Chief Executive, Ministry of Health <br><br>Sarah Stuart-Black—Director, Civil Defence Emergency Management and Deputy Chief Executive of the National Emergency Management Agency <br><br>Dame Therese Walsh—Chairman, Air New Zealand and Pro-Chancellor, Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington <br><br>Dr. Daniel Laufer—Associate Professor of Marketing, Wellington School of Business and Government.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and good morning<br>i'm mary slater from ipans it's my<br>pleasure to welcome you all here<br>to this joint webinar hosted by iplans<br>and victoria university of wellington's<br>school of business and government<br>in a minute i'll hand over to professor<br>williamson and the panel<br>but first a few words about ipans<br>we're an independent organisation<br>committed to supporting<br>a strong vital public administration<br>that's why we're here today in<br>partnership with the university<br>we have a large and growing corporate<br>and individual membership<br>mainly in the public sector in central<br>and local government<br>in ngos and in the private sector<br>so it's our pleasure to welcome you here<br>i'll hand over now<br>to professor williamson who'll introduce<br>you<br>to introduce you our speakers and to<br>host our conversation<br>warm pacific greetings to everyone today<br>mary thank you very much for opening up<br>the ceremonies this morning<br>we're very excited for this event uh<br>this is part of our dean's<br>seminar series uh that i as a dean run<br>and we look at the seminar series the<br>opportunity to bring together<br>thought leaders from around the country<br>and oftentimes even internationally<br>to focus on issues that we know are<br>critical to our community and i can<br>think of<br>no more important topic than this issue<br>around leadership in times of crisis<br>we see ourselves as a global civic<br>university and so this ability to bring<br>together individuals who represent<br>perspectives from government<br>from private sector from the civil<br>society is truly i think what we're<br>trying to achieve here at the wellington<br>school of business and government<br>it's one of the reasons why we're so<br>proud and so happy that we can partner<br>with ipans to sponsor this event<br>it's actually the second time we've<br>worked with ipans we've previously this<br>early this year<br>pre-covet had a great event where we<br>looked at the issue of<br>developing inclusive workforces across<br>new zealand so i think this just builds<br>upon<br>that particular partnership but we'll<br>jump right into today's<br>topic which is leadership in times of<br>crisis and we have a phenomenal group of<br>panelists today to talk about their<br>experiences which i think will bring<br>together the best that we have to offer<br>from the board of academe<br>corporate as well as government let me<br>introduce our panelists<br>so first we have with us someone who i<br>imagine many of us have at least seen<br>at some point in time over the last six<br>months we have dr

covered<br>by such media outlets as cnn the<br>economist the guardian and the associate<br>press<br>dr lufford thank you very much for<br>joining us so i'm going to jump right in<br>and maybe i'll have a seat and get<br>comfortable and we'll start with<br>a discussion around some of the<br>particular topics that we think are<br>quite critical<br>and dr bloomfield i think i'll start<br>with you and i think it's really<br>interesting<br>um in the sense that quite quickly you<br>became if you like the face<br>for our nation in terms of guiding us<br>through this particular time period<br>and you know really was quite critical<br>for individuals to come to trust you<br>to as you talked about really complex<br>issues and complex topics and i really<br>would like to get your sense as to<br>how you prepared yourself for being in<br>that role<br>what were some of the learnings you had<br>in being in that role<br>well uh mourinho and kiyora ketukata<br>it's great to be part of the panel today<br>um i guess i should start by saying<br>nothing prepares you<br>for this and i was reflecting earlier on<br>that<br>uh in the first few weeks of this of<br>this event<br>starting i can remember waking up in the<br>morning thinking i wish this wasn't<br>happening this is the pandemic this is<br>the black black swan event as it became<br>apparent<br>so really there are two or three things<br>i was drawing on<br>and one of those of course was my<br>training over many years<br>starting in medicine working in public<br>health<br>working in a whole range of settings<br>both in new zealand and as you mentioned<br>some time at the who<br>and i've always taken the approach of<br>trying to accumulate<br>knowledge and listen to others and find<br>out um<br>and develop skills and one of the skills<br>i've i<br>i already had a start in was around<br>communication i was used to and<br>comfortable with with public speaking<br>and with media<br>uh but i dare say i've had an<br>opportunity to practice and<br>refine that skill a lot over the last<br>few months and probably done<br>somewhere between 200 and 250 stand-ups<br>or media interviews<br>but i got very good advice from my my<br>comms team uh early on 27th of january i<br>did my<br>first stand-up and they joke about how<br>at that time i had to introduce myself<br>and tell us the public who i was um i<br>don't<br>need to do that so much anymore but that<br>daily stand-up<br>became quite a critical um interface<br>with the public<br>and i soon realized that it was a way<br>for us to get our information out<br>unedited<br>to everybody and of course at the time<br>we were facing that<br>absolutely fundamental leadership<br>challenge which i know others here will<br>have as well<br>having to make huge calls and give<br>advice on very big decisions with very<br>limited and incomplete information<br>uh we now have more information than we<br>we had then<br>but at the time we could only go on what<br>we had<br>and we made a deliberate decision to<br>communicate to the public<br>this is what we know and this is what we<br>don't know<br>and so by the time we got to that point<br>where we said to everybody<br>uh in the third week of march and now we<br>want you to stay at home for four weeks<br>people understood the why and all we<br>were telling them was the what and how<br>and i think that was critical to our<br>success in<br>breaking that chain of transmission in<br>that first wave i think that issue<br>of leadership in that moment of crisis<br>of being comfortable with that<br>vulnerability of being able to identify<br>the things you know but also being able<br>to identify the things you don't know<br>and yet still maintaining trust is quite<br>critical and you know<br>whether particular things in terms of<br>how you thought about communicating<br>particularly those things where you say<br>there's uncertainty here<br>in a moment where people i think<br>probably always want certainty<br>what was your experience around it what<br>was your how did you how did you feel<br>like you navigated that or what advice<br>would you give for individuals<br>who are thinking about how they navigate<br>that look that's an incredibly important<br>question and<br>and i guess that right from day one all<br>i did was try to be myself<br>and you know there's this notion of<br>being authentic and being yourself and<br>that served me well because then i don't<br>have to go back and think what did i say<br>the day before or who was i yesterday<br>and as the sort of interest and uh<br>and my my i guess um penetration into<br>people's<br>households through the television grew<br>um and there was the feedback coming in<br>from the public about how important they<br>found that<br>um you know some of my staff were quite<br>puzzled because they said well all we're<br>seeing is you up there being yourself<br>that's how you are at work and i guess<br>that was<br>the most important feedback i could get<br>is being authentic<br>being open being honest and in<br>particular right from the start saying<br>we don't know this or i haven't got that<br>information but we'll go away and find<br>it<br>and i think that was fundamental to us<br>building trust<br>with the public thank you very much so<br>dame watch we'll ask a few questions for<br>you if you<br>don't mind um you know i think you're<br>you're chair of air new zealand and<br>i can think of no organization has been<br>more impacted by that<br>and and has such a critical role in our<br>society so i just<br>as you reflect upon your experiences not<br>just with air new zealand but although<br>the other in<br>the other organizations how has this<br>experiences covet crisis<br>infected the way you lead in your<br>perspectives around leadership<br>um professor williamson and kira koto<br>um everyone uh look it's a really big<br>question and such a big topic<br>that we're talking about and um i'm<br>still in the throes as as<br>probably most new zealanders are of kind<br>of learning as you lead through crises<br>and um<br>it's been the most significant crisis in<br>the aviation<br>industry's history so it's it's truly<br>significant i mean we went<br>uh from one day to the next losing 95 of<br>our revenue<br>uh which is as big as any crisis you can<br>imagine um in corporate history<br>so really significant and so what are<br>the learnings so far<br>for us particularly in new zealand but<br>also as i look across other<br>organizations and industries that i'm<br>involved with across the country<br>well firstly you've got to take some<br>time really quickly and<br>get the operational piece right and for<br>in new zealand the good<br>part was that we're very used and we<br>have really good<br>muscle when it comes to crisis<br>management when you're putting aircraft<br>into the sky<br>every day you need to make sure that<br>you're very on top of things in that<br>regard so that kind of muscle was there<br>the bit that needed to be overlaid was<br>um<br>some unique uh kind of decision making<br>and<br>with that unique decision-making a<br>little bit like dr bloomfield was<br>talking about you have to<br>take risks you do have incomplete<br>information you have to do what you<br>believe to be the right thing at that<br>time so it needs to be brave<br>and quick decision making to the best of<br>your ability<br>uh judging many things so i'll give you<br>an example of that the wuhan<br>repatriation flight<br>that was a really big call you know when<br>you're leading an organization and<br>you're actually asking people to put<br>themselves on the line<br>for new zealanders and to do that type<br>of admission is a big deal<br>so that's just sort of a little example<br>so from an operational perspective<br>that's really important<br>my background in sport actually in<br>really large scale global sporting<br>events was really important in terms<br>of my own understanding of how commander<br>control works<br>you really need to have strong command<br>and control structures during a crisis<br>because otherwise you can get into<br>chaotic messes with people not<br>understanding their roles and<br>responsibilities so that would kind of<br>be the next thing<br>i think the other thing is that you need<br>to have some people who can have the<br>space to think past the crisis to think<br>to the next phase<br>to think to the medium and to the long<br>term because<br>if you spend too much time on the right<br>here and now<br>operational issues you will lose your<br>way in terms of decision making going<br>forward<br>and probably actually the most important<br>which i'll just finished with<br>is the communication and the engagement<br>especially you know if you think of air<br>new zealand<br>where many people have lost their jobs<br>as a result of this crisis this pandemic<br>communication engagement authenticity<br>all of those things really critical<br>because<br>all the news wasn't good but it was<br>important for the news to be honest<br>for us to continue with our engagement<br>and communication in the face of<br>you know media other stakeholders having<br>views and opinions on things that are<br>going on but actually being true to<br>every<br>new zealander in their own personal<br>journey and how we are supporting that<br>and as part of that looking after each<br>other the resilience of each individual<br>is important and<br>what i think is really interesting is<br>that we'll often sit in a boardroom um<br>perhaps you know a cabinet or somewhere<br>else and you might talk about the<br>resilience and the mental health of<br>those people in your organizations but<br>you've also got to think about the<br>leaders themselves and<br>it's a marathon not a sprint when you're<br>in a crisis mode so<br>those are important lessons for me<br>professor williamson thank you very much<br>i<br>i think it is important to appreciate<br>that it's happening real time in context<br>and all of you are in situations where<br>you're providing information in a public<br>domain<br>so there's always going to be that added<br>pressure any any sense about how you<br>at a personal level ensured that you<br>were your well-being was okay how you<br>handled those pressures any any things<br>that you tried to do to make sure you<br>had that space for yourself<br>just to kind of make sure you stayed on<br>balance i mean i think<br>it's the same as it is normally it's<br>just intensified and i think<br>we all lean on the structures and the<br>processes that we normally have in place<br>to<br>keep ourselves resilient and you know<br>that might be your family your friends<br>you know<br>mum would send me a text saying you know<br>with a smiley face and it's all those<br>things but i think it's um<br>important in the organizations that<br>you're working in to have<br>those relationships where you're<br>actually you know there are very few<br>people you can have the honest<br>conversations with in terms of<br>where you're at where they're at but to<br>have those directly with each other<br>is important so if i think of greg who's<br>the chief executive of new zealand<br>we'd talk every day we check in on each<br>other you know where are we at what's<br>what are we dealing with today how are<br>you etc so i think all those things<br>become really important<br>so mr blake norm maybe i'll ask a few<br>questions of you<br>so one of the interesting things about<br>your role in responding<br>is that you have to pull together a wide<br>variety of different agencies<br>which normally would operate very<br>effectively by themselves but now they<br>need to operate in a highly coordinated<br>manner<br>and that i would imagine be quite<br>challenging and i'd love to get your<br>thoughts about how you go about leading<br>when you're trying to bring together<br>diverse groups of individuals and<br>organizations to<br>achieve a common goal kiara koto<br>everyone<br>um look i think that the as you've heard<br>from the other<br>speakers that this is fast-paced it's<br>intense<br>and it's complex and actually that<br>requires<br>in this situation a joint leadership<br>model so<br>myself and ashley were part of what was<br>called the quintet<br>which wasn't anything to do with musical<br>instruments<br>but was with john ombler mike bush<br>former police commissioner dr peter<br>crabtree<br>leading policy and strategy because this<br>required an entire system response<br>from left to right top to bottom all<br>parts<br>of government lifeline utilities local<br>government<br>a whole range of not-for-profit<br>organizations were all part of this<br>response effort<br>and so the ability for us to be able to<br>complement<br>that resource resourcing requirement<br>with existing networks and organizations<br>that were practiced and experienced was<br>critical to this<br>for ashley and i we both have<br>a unique legislative role<br>and so for us um and i'm sure ashley<br>will have some commentary on this too<br>there had to be no air gap between what<br>i was doing in my statutory role<br>in complementing ashley as the person<br>leading the response<br>and part of the challenge we have is<br>with devolved accountability models<br>both in health and in civil defense<br>emergency management<br>it's really important that the work that<br>we do is<br>is is underpinned by strong and<br>effective relationships because we're<br>asking people to do<br>things above and beyond what they might<br>also have to do for other types of<br>emergencies<br>so in some situations during this covert<br>response<br>i asked civil defense emergency<br>management groups to do things i've<br>never asked of them before<br>it was uncomfortable at times and<br>challenging<br>but equally those civil defense<br>emergency management groups did those<br>things<br>because they knew that we were asking<br>them because it was critically important<br>that it was part of the evidence basis<br>of what actions needed to be taken i<br>think in terms of the resourcing itself<br>we had a number of challenges which were<br>unique to covert<br>when we have an emergency normally i say<br>normally it feels like we're having them<br>a lot<br>and my time is directed there's been<br>over 50.<br>we can surge in support into an affected<br>area so you have a<br>severe weather event or an earthquake we<br>can bring in resources from around the<br>country to support that affected area<br>in covid the resources you had in your<br>region at that time<br>were the resources you were going to<br>have throughout lockdown and as we move<br>through the alert levels<br>so the ability for our civil defense<br>emergency management groups to work with<br>the dhbs and<br>all of the regionally based agencies and<br>organizations that they had available<br>to resource the response effort so i<br>think that's one unique element<br>another is of course the the stringent<br>public health<br>actions that were required around<br>physical distancing<br>about their hygiene advice which meant<br>that we needed to apply a flexible<br>approach to the way that we<br>staffed this response so that was about<br>having people that were working at home<br>some people that were working in their<br>home agencies and some people in the<br>national crisis management centre<br>and we moved the centre to be co-located<br>with health<br>to make sure that again that we were as<br>close as we could be<br>and aligned as we could be for that<br>overall response<br>effort at a central government level we<br>drew on<br>agencies from across the entire public<br>sector<br>there were those that have had<br>experience in emergency management from<br>past emergencies<br>but there was a whole lot of people that<br>had no exposure at any time in their<br>professional careers<br>so the ability to be able to induct<br>people in support them to learn the role<br>that they were going to be doing<br>but also to recognize the extraordinary<br>talent we have in the new zealand public<br>service<br>and so i think as a best guess i would<br>say there were thousands<br>involved in the overall response effort<br>because part of it was also continuing<br>the critical<br>business of government so that we<br>continued with those<br>those roles and responsibilities but<br>also<br>enabling us to actually see some<br>absolute stars and<br>highly talented people come to four so<br>whilst this<br>continues to be challenging continues to<br>be intense<br>and in fact we have had concurrent<br>emergencies at the same time as covert<br>what we need to do i think looking<br>forward from here is consider<br>how do we make sure we leverage all of<br>that experience and knowledge and<br>exposure<br>that all agencies have had through<br>covert to make sure that we increase our<br>bench strength<br>overall for whatever the next challenge<br>will be because it may not be covert<br>and it may not be one of the traditional<br>emergencies that we've experienced in<br>the past<br>thank you unfortunately more creative in<br>the future we'll never know<br>hopefully not um maybe i'll dr loughard<br>i'd love to get your perspective on this<br>so you've spent most of your career<br>studying<br>um how organizations and how leaders<br>respond to periods of crisis obviously<br>this is<br>one of the most amazing crises we've<br>ever had to deal with but it's certainly<br>not the<br>only one we've had to deal with and i<br>would love to get your thoughts on<br>the types of observations you've made<br>around leaders that have been very<br>successful in leading organizations or<br>communities through periods of crisis<br>but also perhaps<br>some of the lessons you learn in terms<br>of things that leaders shouldn't do<br>when leading organizations through<br>periods of crisis<br>thank you and good morning everyone in<br>terms<br>of success stories with regards to<br>leadership during crises<br>uh i'll talk about two one from overseas<br>and one from new zealand one related to<br>covet 19 and one<br>unrelated which is important as well<br>because there are many different types<br>of crises<br>so let me start with the one from<br>overseas that's related to covid<br>19 and that relates to um the ceo of<br>marriott<br>and his communications with employees<br>it's really a remarkable story because<br>the sa at the same time<br>he's sending this message this<br>five-minute message to employees<br>he has his own personal battle with<br>cancer<br>and so what did he communicate to<br>employees<br>first of all he was honest and upfront<br>about the situation facing<br>marriott he said it was the worst crisis<br>in the history of the company uh much<br>worse than the depression<br>and the financial crisis from 2008<br>the other thing he did was he led by<br>example<br>he said that he wouldn't take a salary<br>for the next year<br>and also in terms of his leadership team<br>they would take a cut of 50 percent<br>also he had a plan he talked about<br>the need to cut costs in order to<br>survive<br>he was upfront about the situation and<br>he didn't hide the difficulties<br>the other thing he did was he expressed<br>emotion he teared up<br>when talking about how covet 19<br>is really beyond anyone's control and<br>it's not anyone's fault for what's<br>happening<br>and that good people are going to hurt<br>as a result of it<br>and finally he ended by talking about<br>hope<br>he talked about how in china this was<br>the message by the way was sent back in<br>march at the end of march<br>and so he said that they will manage and<br>things will be okay it'll take time and<br>they can already see<br>that the demand for hotels and for<br>staying at hotels<br>is increasing in china so um<br>it was a really very very powerful<br>message that went viral<br>and i really would encourage people to<br>search on youtube<br>to see it it's a great example of how to<br>communicate during a crisis<br>so that's with regards to covid now with<br>regards to another type of crisis<br>i want to use an example that<br>of a crisis that the growers association<br>the strawberry growers association of<br>new zealand faced<br>when two years ago a needle was found in<br>a strawberry that was imported from<br>australia in a supermarket in auckland<br>this relates to my my work on crisis<br>contagion and crisis contagion<br>is when a crisis that hits one<br>organization<br>spreads to another um that's innocent<br>that has really nothing to do with<br>what's happening and so in the case of<br>the strawberry crisis<br>needles were found in strawberries<br>imported from australia<br>but you have strawberry growers here in<br>new zealand<br>and that spills over people that go to<br>supermarkets<br>are very concerned about finding a<br>needle in a strawberry and that impacts<br>strawberry growers here<br>now why do i use this as an example of<br>leadership during a crisis<br>um the chief executive at the<br>um at the group the industry group<br>um strawberry growers association<br>reacted very quickly and decisively<br>what did he do he essentially uh said<br>listen we're different from australia<br>strawberry growers in new zealand differ<br>from growers in australia<br>from the perspective of farms in new<br>zealand are primarily<br>family farms in australia they're<br>primarily corporate farms<br>in family farms people know<br>who they hire much better than when you<br>have a corporate farm<br>that was a very powerful message and he<br>essentially by communicating that<br>really saved the industry at that time<br>because that was at the beginning of the<br>harvest<br>so that's another great example of<br>leadership during a crisis<br>and it's important to keep in mind it's<br>not just covid there are a lot of<br>different types of crises<br>and they all need to be managed<br>so i want to go back to a point that dr<br>bloomfield made<br>when he was speaking earlier about the<br>communication of the why<br>and in every example that you were<br>providing there was obviously going to<br>be a situation where individuals were<br>going to have to<br>go over and beyond there's going to be<br>some type of sacrifice<br>some type of discretionary effort and<br>and i'd just like to get your<br>perspectives on one the importance of<br>communicating that<br>of the why and then and how to best go<br>about doing it<br>and there was a great book that i once<br>read searched for meaning<br>by a psychologist franco who said<br>suffering cease to be suffering when it<br>has purpose at that point it becomes<br>sacrifice<br>and i really think that distinction<br>between suffering and sacrifice is<br>leadership<br>i would love to get your perspectives on<br>how do you how do you lead a group of<br>individuals to appreciate that why<br>why we need to make that sacrifice for<br>particular outcomes<br>uh ian can i just start with a couple of<br>comments and and first on that and then<br>i just do want to<br>endorse some of the previous speakers<br>comments about leadership and crisis<br>in terms of the question you've asked i<br>think this was one of the<br>um you know the communicating the why to<br>both those working across the public and<br>private sector to respond to this<br>challenge but also to the wider public<br>gave people a very clear sense of common<br>purpose<br>and um there's nothing you know the<br>first task of<br>leadership is to uh ensure there is a<br>vision<br>it's not give a vision or direct<br>division it's to ensure there was one<br>and<br>i think we created this uh this<br>opportunity in new zealand where people<br>could see<br>actually if we do this we we will<br>achieve this collectively<br>and i've used this definition of<br>leadership of being an invitation to<br>collective action<br>and we issued that invitation and<br>actually<br>i'm not the only one who was uh in fact<br>stunned by the extent to which new<br>zealanders leaned in<br>cooperated and the outcome was beyond<br>what we imagined it might have been<br>uh so before i perhaps let the others<br>comment on your question i just want to<br>really quickly endorse three points that<br>have been made first of all<br>um the command and control need in a<br>crisis situation<br>this is not how we roll in the health<br>sector we're a very relational<br>system and this is one of the challenges<br>of leadership is to be able to pivot<br>your leadership style<br>and deploy different leadership<br>approaches<br>when needs must and i got to the point<br>where we were having daily<br>tele conferences with our dhb chief<br>executives<br>who are very independent and enjoy um<br>doing<br>things their way uh where i had some of<br>the ones<br>uh some of them saying to me at the end<br>of that<br>we need you to tell us what to do and we<br>will follow<br>so there is there was a real time and<br>place and i've given more directives in<br>the last few months than i had in my<br>entire career previously<br>but that was what was needed uh the<br>second uh point i wanted to make was one<br>of the things<br>and norm touched on this one of the<br>things that was stunning but possibly<br>not surprising<br>was the extent to which people did<br>things without being asked<br>they saw what was needed and they led<br>and so<br>a really important role for leaders in<br>this situation is to enable and empower<br>those around you to to lead without<br>permission to just do the necessary and<br>not be bothered by the usual<br>transactional bureaucratic processes of<br>government<br>and the extent to which people did that<br>is in large part responsible for the<br>success of i think new zealand's<br>response<br>and the third thing i'd just like to<br>endorse the point about leadership<br>giving<br>hope and that's particularly important<br>in a situation like this where<br>we can't see what's going to happen next<br>but we can give hope<br>and in the midst of uncertainty that's<br>what people need to have<br>and of course in new zealand i think we<br>have created a situation where we can<br>have hope because we have shown<br>if we act um together if we act<br>decisively<br>we can actually control the things that<br>are within our purview and then<br>we can chart our path forward<br>others comments i i think just a couple<br>of comments on the y part<br>um i think when you basically ground<br>your entire fleet<br>and within a few days i think the why<br>becomes quite apparent<br>um so but what becomes important then to<br>sort of<br>make the y more palatable is um<br>is the empathy that goes around that and<br>the engagement<br>in the communications and i think um<br>eddie in new zealand we were able to<br>lean into our culture<br>that that that has been built up over<br>many years into what is a<br>high-performing organization and so<br>people um new zealand we call them air<br>new zealanders<br>air new zealanders think of the job<br>as much more of a<br>i guess a service you know something<br>that you do it's a calling it's<br>something you do for the broader<br>community<br>and we understand that our role is to<br>connect new zealanders with the world<br>whether that be trade people etc<br>and for that reason there were a couple<br>of things that kind of just stood out in<br>the why<br>the why is you know yes we'll do a wuhan<br>repatriation flight yes we'll do cargo<br>services<br>while we're still in lockdown level four<br>um and people<br>would you know we'd ask for volunteers<br>and we'd have so many<br>because people just really wanted to<br>live that sense of uh<br>service and purpose and when it came to<br>the why the why<br>um had an implication for us and that<br>was as i mentioned before that<br>thousands of people lost their jobs what<br>we found is that on the whole<br>um people were extremely accepting of<br>that<br>and incredibly dignified in the exits<br>many planes in fact norman i were just<br>talking about it before many planes<br>where<br>someone on the flight crew was having<br>their final flight and actually made a<br>beautiful speech to the plane<br>followed by great applause no hugs i can<br>promise you but<br>you know just uh and people have gone on<br>to incredible jobs and so i think that<br>incredible level of communication<br>engagement and empathy that went<br>alongside<br>the y which was very clear but the why<br>for the broader new zealand and we still<br>have to fly every week to certain ports<br>internationally<br>with a great deal of care ppe and all<br>those things to make sure that<br>our families and friends that are stuck<br>overseas can get back here to new<br>zealand and so<br>there's kind of a really a higher order<br>purpose that that has gravitated the<br>organisation in the midst of<br>such difficulty um i think<br>one of the the challenges we have is<br>around<br>having had so many emergencies that in<br>fact the thread that binds<br>is around the impact of the work that we<br>do<br>on those that live work or visit new<br>zealand<br>and so in a covert situation you have<br>that as a clear<br>as a clear backdrop the the challenge on<br>top of that is the fact that<br>every part of every person's life is<br>directly impacted<br>unlike say we you know and bearing in<br>mind that earlier in the year<br>just before we moved into the alert<br>levels we had floods down south<br>for those people in those areas clearly<br>they're impacted but also we can bring<br>in that support<br>to support those communities for this<br>situation it means that each of us<br>individually<br>have our own situations at home with our<br>own family considerations<br>children or parents other dependents but<br>equally<br>the role that we're performing is is<br>very different we're adjusting and being<br>agile about how that plays out<br>but also the nature of what this means<br>across our business as usual<br>and across the systems we operate in is<br>also different<br>so the challenge of trying to ensure<br>that<br>we're we're caring for all those that<br>are trying to process what does this<br>mean for them<br>and against uncertainty against<br>things that might be changing quite<br>rapidly personally and professionally<br>but also that ability to make sure that<br>it's<br>it's understood and i think ashley um<br>spoke to this around the<br>the team of five million everyone taking<br>a sense of their personal responsibility<br>in this<br>because individual actions mattered and<br>so that is the same in terms of when we<br>think about those involved in response<br>and having that autonomy to be able to<br>get on with the job whether in the<br>private sector<br>public not-for-profit is actually to be<br>able to enable people to take those<br>actions for themselves but recognize<br>the benefits and create the overall<br>outcome for the greater good of the<br>country and i think that in itself<br>became really palatable and well<br>understood<br>around how we actually get ahead of<br>covert 19.<br>i'm mindful that we certainly have made<br>available for people to post<br>questions on the chat function and so in<br>a minute or so we're going to sort of go<br>to that and see what type of questions<br>our audience out there<br>is providing but maybe before we get to<br>the audience questions i'll ask one more<br>question to the panel<br>uh it has been my observation certainly<br>in the role that i have at the<br>university that the pressures that you<br>were talking about<br>all the various aspects that this has<br>had for us individually in our<br>households and our lives<br>you know people wear those and and i<br>i've had to say that people said you<br>know<br>it's okay if i don't see your best self<br>today you know it's going to be some<br>days where i get to see the best you and<br>there'll be some days where i'll see the<br>other you<br>and we're going to get through that so<br>there's going to be moments of conflict<br>you know despite the best intentions<br>despite a clear understanding of why<br>we're doing this there's probably<br>moments of conflict<br>and i'd be curious to get some sense<br>from you in terms of<br>how you have managed that conflict that<br>inevitably comes when you're dealing<br>with a high anxiety high stress<br>situation<br>or perhaps insights about how leaders in<br>other situations have handled this<br>conflict<br>i think my observation would be the the<br>the opportunity to take a breath um<br>even during lockdown and it was pretty<br>unique<br>here in wellington you know you could<br>walk across the parliamentary precinct<br>there's not a car a person a bike you<br>can hear tui<br>and nothing else the the ability to<br>to take a breath when when things are<br>high pressured is really important no<br>matter<br>what role you're operating in but<br>there's something about<br>being able to step through problems and<br>issues<br>and try and make sure you can tackle<br>them one bite at a time<br>they can seem insurmountable but in fact<br>the ability to<br>unpack them and work through them one<br>thing at a time<br>actually means you can reach outcomes my<br>observation of<br>the the covert response and the kind of<br>pressures there was about<br>you know bringing your whole self to<br>work and being able to say when you're<br>having a tough day<br>and people feeling that support<br>i'm i'm a hugger and that was my biggest<br>personal challenge i think during the<br>alert levels<br>but finding other ways you know a bit of<br>a joke and a laugh about you do an<br>ankle tap a elbow tap<br>you do a hip tap and it's kind of in<br>there and the eyebrows is your full<br>top to bottom hug but also<br>what you say and your body language<br>around showing<br>care for those around that are finding<br>this really hard<br>giving people the opportunity to have<br>time out<br>you know and also a sense of humor that<br>actually it's<br>it's okay and there are days when the<br>pressure is really high but that being<br>able to be<br>supported and support others becomes<br>critically important<br>and no one's immune from those pressures<br>you know i think at the heart of this we<br>see the very best of leadership<br>at all levels leaders leadership is in<br>all of us it's not something that<br>is for only some people it's in all of<br>us<br>but equally you can see the very worst<br>and the challenge i think is to find<br>ways to support<br>people to be able to find their way<br>through this<br>and be able to then get the support that<br>they need<br>i just build on that by saying that i<br>think across all the companies that i'm<br>involved with<br>i think it's um it's been absolutely<br>okay to not be okay<br>and i think actually one of the silver<br>linings if there are any of covert is<br>that<br>um i think this will accelerate um<br>the kind of mental health systems that<br>we have both in the private private<br>public sector and just more generally<br>and i think it's really clear that<br>people have different levels of<br>resilience<br>and you know we need to be supportive of<br>that and wrap<br>wrap the things around people that they<br>need where the resilience is<br>is kind of a little more limited um and<br>we're all different like that<br>in different contexts and different<br>environments the really<br>cool thing that i've seen is that people<br>have been very creative<br>around some of those issues and<br>anxieties that you talked about<br>some people being stuck at home on zoom<br>calls team calls all the time<br>um it's it's you know people become very<br>creative about how to make that<br>fun and how to make that interactive and<br>engaging i mean you know i<br>i know a lot of my fellow board<br>colleagues<br>pets by name now some of the children<br>that might pop<br>up and ask for a biscuit halfway through<br>a meeting we've seen so many things on<br>the internet<br>which are you know there was a woman<br>that accidentally took her uh<br>ipad to the bathroom um and<br>made an appropriate entrance to a<br>meeting there's been all sorts of things<br>but i think it's kind of humanized it's<br>actually you know sometimes people sort<br>of look like they might be in their<br>pajamas<br>um and but it's humanized us and i think<br>it's created more of an ability to show<br>to norm's point who you are and for<br>people to be creative and and to<br>prop up those that aren't feeling<br>resilient on a particular day or a<br>particular week so it's<br>there is some um there are some bright<br>spots that have come out of it in terms<br>of how we're connecting as individuals<br>and human beings<br>i think it's also important for leaders<br>to understand<br>when they're not ready for instance to<br>face the public<br>because of how they feel i'll give you<br>an example from overseas<br>the ceo of vp when there was the oil<br>spill<br>there was a very infamous saying that<br>came out of him when he was speaking to<br>the media<br>he said and i'm sure he regrets this of<br>course<br>he wants his life back he also wants his<br>life back so suddenly<br>it was more about how is he was feeling<br>even though of course<br>the crisis was about the victims and<br>what happened as a result of the oil<br>spill<br>and when i teach crisis management i use<br>this as an example<br>of how you can learn as a leader from<br>the situation<br>actually what he said a lot of people<br>feel<br>you're under a lot of pressure and<br>stress and your life has gotten<br>a lot harder as a result of the crisis<br>but of course<br>you don't want to express that but when<br>you're under a lot of stress<br>that's what happens and really<br>what is a good takeaway from that<br>situation<br>is perhaps he should have been shielded<br>from the media at that moment by his<br>people<br>so there's a lot that can be learned<br>from<br>uh just how you feel internally in terms<br>of whether or not you should be speaking<br>publicly<br>uh ian this is this is one of the things<br>i've been<br>quite open about and it's been reported<br>over recent weeks including an article<br>in the herald last week<br>um that just being open about of course<br>um ahead of the daily stand-ups i would<br>feel<br>i would feel focused i would feel my<br>cortisol levels rising<br>i would need to make sure i was well<br>prepared and as the weeks went by i<br>could feel that my anxiety and stress<br>levels were<br>were rising and and to the day when i<br>didn't have a stand up but felt the same<br>emotions and i realized actually this<br>means i do need a break<br>um and and i guess that there's a<br>tendency to conflate<br>feeling stressed and anxious with not<br>being resilient in fact that you can't<br>be resilient unless you recognize<br>your limitations unless you recognize<br>the anxiety the stress levels<br>and then you proactively take steps to<br>address those<br>and one of those key steps is taking a<br>break when you need to and that can be a<br>short break or<br>you know it can be needing to take a<br>week off and just go and reset<br>but i think for me that's been a big<br>learning and i've been trying to<br>contribute to this<br>this discussion about actually even the<br>people who appear calm<br>and are doing this and and you know i'm<br>not someone who actually suffers from<br>anxiety<br>i don't tend to experience high levels<br>of stress<br>but it doesn't mean they're not there<br>and that<br>we shouldn't be open about that and be<br>accepting of it<br>and be looking out for it in each other<br>and taking and supporting each other to<br>take the steps that we need to take<br>to address it and therefore be resilient<br>it's<br>really critical i mean you want to be<br>there for your people but you can't be<br>there for your people if you yourself<br>aren't ready<br>and i think recognizing our own human<br>limitations<br>is something that that that humbleness<br>is quite critical for i think any<br>effective leader<br>maybe we have some questions from the<br>broader audience<br>and we can see what types of thoughts<br>so there's a question which and what<br>we're able to do is<br>hold together the questions to see votes<br>and which ones<br>rise to the top and the number one<br>question that individuals have we've<br>touched on a little bit but maybe people<br>can maybe share<br>their own personal stories about looking<br>after their own mental well-being<br>and how they how you have handled that<br>or how you support your staff in<br>handling their mental well-being through<br>periods of time of crisis or anxiety<br>any any thoughts about it that you like<br>to add on to that you haven't discussed<br>i have two daughters 9 and 11.<br>they helped keep me very grounded<br>because when you get home<br>it doesn't matter what kind of day<br>you've had actually they're looking<br>for their mother to be present and<br>engaged and to still<br>do dinner and read stories and do the<br>night time routine<br>so i've found that that has been um<br>particularly<br>helpful because there's no way to avoid<br>it you know<br>the we got two kittens just before<br>lockdown which seemed<br>which was unrelated to lockdown but as<br>it worked out was<br>um was the way it worked out um those<br>kittens have challenged me<br>around their toileting behavior and so<br>that is another thing that is just<br>creates a groundingness that you know<br>you're still<br>cleaning up things at home or you're<br>you're you're drawn back into<br>the reality of life that actually helps<br>go that's right<br>there's all of these really practical<br>things and i think those help to<br>to keep the focus around what's what you<br>need to focus on right now<br>and not not repeatedly being drawn into<br>perhaps thinking about those other<br>stresses but like ashley said you know<br>that i<br>i certainly i took myself um out for<br>breaks<br>even a few minutes um i think when we<br>got to alert level three and it was<br>physically possible to get coffee<br>that really helped that actually some<br>routine<br>about what are the things that are<br>normalized for you that you would<br>normally do<br>to be able to take some time out trying<br>to make sure you<br>you maintain those but also being able<br>to share with others when you have those<br>those pressured days or when things are<br>particularly tough<br>or a really chunky issue that needs to<br>be worked through drawing others in to<br>talk that through<br>i think becomes part of it i would love<br>to say that it was exercise but in my<br>particular situation i just<br>that might have been the thing that<br>would have broken me um<br>but i just think it's finding your own<br>things that help you be grounded<br>other other thoughts individuals like to<br>share um well i think<br>uh a couple of things well firstly my<br>children are in their 20s so they<br>weren't interested in a bedtime story so<br>um that was there wasn't that therapy<br>available to me um<br>however i think the one thing for me<br>that was the most important was that<br>even though air new zealand was the<br>private sector company most impacted by<br>covert and continues to be<br>there are others there were others that<br>were impacted and um<br>the business community in new zealand is<br>small uh and<br>you know you're able to tap into your<br>colleagues your peers you<br>you know the broader sector who are<br>dealing with challenges<br>um and lean into each other and you know<br>i'd have many sort of chairman to<br>chairman discussions<br>um with others uh in in the nzx top 50<br>or<br>whatever and you know just yeah we're<br>all we're all dealing with it<br>you're not the only person that's<br>impacted and i think the other critical<br>thing you know you're taking breaks is<br>really important<br>but to take a break you have to trust<br>other people<br>nobody is indispensable and so<br>getting that into everyone's mindset is<br>really important because<br>if it is a marathon not a sprint you<br>can't own it every moment<br>and so you have to be able to say hey<br>actually today i have to do this so the<br>deputy chairman is now going to you know<br>that's going to be for her today<br>and so delegation and making sure that<br>there are people around you<br>you know we all have to work in a team<br>it can't just be one person and um that<br>becomes even more critical in a crisis<br>so uh there's you mentioned earlier in<br>one of your comments about<br>there's this need to deal with the here<br>and now but it's important to also have<br>individuals around you<br>that are thinking about tomorrow or<br>perhaps even next year<br>and i'd be curious to get some sense<br>from from you as a panel<br>um how do you deal with that issue of we<br>have to survive<br>but there also has to still be an eye on<br>strategy<br>about what we're going to be doing going<br>forward and how you balance that or how<br>how you set that up structurally or<br>or just what is the ways in which you've<br>thought about that as potentially<br>attention<br>well our energy has to be the only<br>getting to today but<br>we we have to be planning for tomorrow<br>as well i'll start since i raised it and<br>others will have other thoughts i mean i<br>think when you sit on a board of<br>directors in particular if you're<br>cheering the board<br>your job isn't to manage every aspect of<br>the day-to-day operations and your job<br>is to have a broader mindset so<br>it really was important for me to make<br>sure that the board had time to set<br>aside to think about<br>okay you know the fleet might be<br>grounded now we might be in the middle<br>of all of these things that are<br>happening but actually<br>we're still going to be an airline in<br>three or four years time and so what<br>does that look like<br>how does that feel and to dr<br>bloomfield's early comment about hope<br>that inspires hope because you need to<br>put a little bit of that in there<br>because actually we're thinking about<br>the long term because it is a long term<br>when you start saying there's no long<br>term then that's a real issue<br>so that to me is really important is<br>getting that that long term focus<br>so if again i just lean into the in new<br>zealand example<br>we had a new chief executive the first<br>day we uh he started we stopped flying<br>to shanghai because of covert so it's<br>been quite an interesting introduction<br>for him<br>but actually we've still leaned on him<br>to develop a new strategy in conjunction<br>with the board and we're actually about<br>to launch that<br>so you actually just have to create time<br>it's a discipline and especially when<br>you're in the private sector<br>you know you are holding in the palm of<br>your hands she holds his money it is our<br>absolute obligation to make sure we're<br>doing the right things by them<br>as well as by the country and so um we<br>have to have a plan we have to have a<br>way forward<br>we have to think and of course no one<br>has a crystal ball no one knows exactly<br>what will be<br>happening will we all be flying to la<br>for a holiday in one year or four years<br>no one actually knows the answer so you<br>know planning in that kind of<br>environment is tricky but you have to do<br>it<br>and you have to have a clear sort of<br>pathway emerge so<br>really important again to that team<br>thing and no one is indispensable some<br>people have to be a bit more focused<br>longer midterms some people have to be<br>more focused on<br>how we're getting that plane out today<br>other thoughts around that can i just<br>comment this is something we've found a<br>real challenge in the health<br>ministry and this is the wider health<br>system<br>uh for a couple of reasons the first of<br>course uh<br>for the first few months of the year we<br>were responding full noise to this<br>very uncertain situation and as the lead<br>agency across government so<br>it was a very operational day-to-day and<br>rapid decision-making<br>setting we were working in then as we<br>came back down through the levels of<br>course we still had a health system to<br>lead<br>delivering health care to<br>new zealanders from pre-cradle to grave<br>and<br>so the immediate focus was what have<br>people missed out on how do we ramp the<br>system up again so again it was quite a<br>near-term focus<br>we were also planning for the next<br>possible outbreak which came our way in<br>the last few weeks in auckland and we've<br>responded again to that<br>and in a sense it's whilst we've had a a<br>bit of a strategic view through that<br>we're just now<br>starting to think how do we how do we<br>actually free up a team of people and<br>not pull them at all<br>into the operational side of things so<br>that they can be thinking about the 3<br>6 12 24 months ahead because the<br>the view that we can develop from a<br>health and public health perspective<br>about where this pandemic might be going<br>the different options<br>will be essential to be able to inform<br>other parts of government indeed the<br>private sector<br>and the whole community about what to<br>plan for and what to what to expect<br>so we take that very seriously but it's<br>you have to be incredibly deliberate<br>about it and we've found that a real<br>challenge today<br>for uh for us we became a departmental<br>agency<br>as the national emergency management<br>agency on the 1st of december 2019<br>we think we've had nine days without an<br>emergency<br>during that time till now with a number<br>of concurrent emergencies happening at<br>the same time and i think<br>there's a couple of elements there<br>there's one around the next emergency<br>could happen at any time so there's<br>there's the need to stay focused on<br>how are we tracking against our ability<br>to<br>adjust or be agile should should the<br>next thing<br>occur in the meantime but also because<br>we're in the middle of an emergency<br>management system reform<br>how do we continue to both stabilize a<br>new organisation<br>but also progress the the issues that in<br>fact we're<br>we're finding have been amplified or<br>have crystallized even more specifically<br>during the covert response<br>and so the ability to keep<br>some elements of that going so that<br>you're benefiting in that<br>in that medium term is is critically<br>important<br>so carolyn schwelger who's our chief<br>executive<br>has basically been focused on being able<br>to make sure we were making that<br>progress around stabilizing<br>the nema workforce and progressing the<br>work that would need to be done around<br>our legislation<br>our arrangements so that as we adjust to<br>covert<br>being our new backdrop for everything<br>how we start to build in the agility to<br>take account of that as part of business<br>as usual rather than a sense of<br>lurch every time we might have a<br>resurgence or<br>when the next emergency happens it's<br>trying to actually create more<br>smoothness<br>in the way as a system that we start to<br>adjust to these challenges<br>i think in terms of the point uh<br>the government really faces a huge<br>challenge<br>in terms of what to focus on what to<br>communicate<br>how much to talk about kovid how much to<br>talk about the future<br>um and um it's tricky because<br>um of course everyone is very interested<br>in the situation around kovid<br>but at the same time they want to know<br>what's happening<br>after it's over and of course this is<br>happening in the context of an election<br>which makes makes things even more<br>complicated so any mistake in terms of<br>the focus<br>could be very detrimental in terms of<br>the outcome of the election<br>so so the issue is not only for<br>companies and organizations it's also at<br>the government level<br>a very uh tricky issue um<br>how much to talk about the crisis that<br>you're managing as opposed to tomorrow<br>yeah it's interesting to sort of be<br>working on the foundation and building a<br>house at the same time is a pretty<br>tricky<br>uh task to do but i think it's certainly<br>uh<br>it is what is called of us at this<br>moment in time and and i guess this is<br>just the responsibility that leaders and<br>organizations both big and small will<br>have to face<br>i think i'm going to draw to a close and<br>i'm going to ask<br>mary slater in a minute to come up and<br>provide the final statement about it but<br>before i step aside<br>i just want to say thank you very much<br>to each of you<br>one first and foremost for today in<br>terms of sharing<br>your insight across a wide variety of<br>experiences<br>also i just really appreciate your<br>humility<br>and talking about how you've all had to<br>deal with and provide guidance to<br>individuals<br>in some pretty challenging situations<br>and sort of speaking<br>candidly about that and i think that<br>that humanizing of it is certainly<br>something that<br>i think people will really reflect upon<br>and i think they probably take a lot of<br>confidence from<br>but most importantly perhaps is the the<br>tremendous role each of you have played<br>over the last over this year really<br>helping us as a community<br>survive literally in some cases<br>also make sense of what's going on<br>providing us with guidance to understand<br>this thing that<br>perhaps most of us would not actually<br>even comprehend we know it's there<br>and all of that really does require um<br>the things that you all have done<br>and so just on behalf of our university<br>but perhaps also for our community but<br>certainly for me<br>i just want to thank you very much for<br>that leadership it you know there's<br>there's times when we can criticize<br>leaders but there are moments in time<br>where we appreciate thank goodness we<br>have a good leader<br>and i certainly appreciate all the great<br>leadership that you've been able to do<br>so i'm going to step out and i'm going<br>to ask mary to come in and perhaps have<br>some<br>some final say statements before we<br>thanks ian and my very warm<br>thanks to all of the panelists this<br>morning it's been a real privilege<br>to be here with you in the room to be<br>able to listen<br>to your talk i just wanted to say a<br>couple of things that i've learned<br>from today and just land<br>with a proverb which i think might<br>fit the discussion that we've had first<br>the things that i learned<br>how important listening and learning is<br>in a leadership role particularly<br>preparing to make<br>enormous decisions with limited<br>information that was something several<br>of you<br>referred to and it really struck a chord<br>with me<br>i really liked your emphasis on striking<br>a balance between<br>inspirational leadership building hope<br>on the one hand<br>and levelling with the public and in<br>your case for example dante<br>is with your own employees about the<br>tough times<br>to come i really liked the emphasis<br>on balancing the demands of the day with<br>the need for the long view<br>learning from today to build the bench<br>strength<br>for the future and ipans will be doing<br>some more work on this we've<br>done it stewardship because that's<br>what's called in our legislation<br>and we'd like to explore those themes<br>further they seem to me to be very<br>opposite themes for today and for our<br>future<br>the question in my mind that i'm going<br>to take away and think about<br>is the contradiction that several of you<br>raised about a command and control<br>approach versus the devolved<br>accountability<br>uh resting on relational not the<br>importance of relationships that tension<br>seems to me to be<br>one which is at the center of our<br>discussions today<br>and in your response and i really like<br>the way you've raised it and i'm going<br>to think a lot more about that for the<br>future<br>and then in our last few seconds<br>i'd like to just repeat<br>the important proverb which i if i can<br>find it<br>the proverb that summarizes<br>what many of you have said it's all<br>thank you again and to those of you who<br>are watching<br>enjoy your day i'm sure you've found the<br>discussion as interesting<br>you</p></main><footer
