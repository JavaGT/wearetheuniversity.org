At BuildingPoint, we look after the Trimble Buildings Suite throughout Australia and New Zealand. The Trimble Buildings Suite combines 3D modelling, digital set out, laser scanning, cloud-based collaboration and mixed reality solutions into the one refined design & construction workflow.<br><br>Join us in exploring the solutions around the Trimble Buildings Suite.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and

what we do is digitizing<br>design and construction now trimble<br>is a global company that specializes in<br>gis<br>it also specializes in acquiring<br>companies so to speak<br>um part of their acquisitions were a lot<br>of buildings companies<br>of building software and hardware<br>companies<br>part of that actually starts to build a<br>big ecosystem in regards to what trimble<br>can offer<br>in the in the ecosystem what i'll do is<br>i'll overview what we are as building<br>point now group itself and what<br>what makes us so um diverse in regards<br>to australian new zealand<br>um the digital strategy so it may<br>come as a surprise but as a<br>reseller of a of a basically of trimble<br>itself we still have to<br>put together a strategy so we can tie<br>everything together and present<br>this to two clients and present this to<br>people all around<br>the world um we've worked on projects in<br>hong kong<br>auckland auckland airport we're working<br>with as well at the moment<br>so the herger group so herbie group is<br>a third generation company or family-run<br>business<br>by the bright family now you'll see that<br>on the right-hand side that some<br>familiar names altera which is in<br>which is based over in new zealand upg<br>scitec and building point<br>we've got offices in all them all the<br>main<br>main sort of areas of australia new<br>zealand<br>um the red options are the uh basically<br>our offices and the yellow or hot desks<br>um so if you have any questions or<br>anything christchurch auckland<br>that's where we are and we're also<br>now building point as i've discussed<br>just before building point look after<br>all the trimble buildings technology<br>when it comes to<br>3d laser scanning set out any 3d<br>modeling as well so architectural 3d<br>model<br>modelling structural 3d modeling<br>fabrication processes<br>and we just look after the essentially<br>if it has to be built and it's not it's<br>a non-civil<br>object so it's not a bridges aren't<br>out of this out of the scope but if it's<br>a big high-rise or residential building<br>we can definitely uh tackle that with<br>any of the buildings<br>software and hardware so<br>at digital strategy um when you're<br>thinking and sort of bim execution plans<br>is a big thing as well<br>um from the design is basically where<br>things start so if you're thinking from<br>the start<br>where does this data have to go that's<br>where we're thinking um<br>obviously we're creating sharing<br>collaborating um through the 3d model<br>and through the 3d environment it's gone<br>to the day where you're sending pdfs or<br>sending<br>2d drawings out to clients and out to<br>site to start doing set up<br>everything is really based off a 3d<br>constructable model<br>now the one model can be used right from<br>the start right from<br>a conceptual phase in the likes of a<br>sketchup or<br>or a rabbit for instance or even a<br>rhino grasshopper scenario um all the<br>way through to fabrication<br>and also construction and erection of<br>steel work and concrete and pouring<br>rebar ordering the whole lot can be<br>automated the whole way through<br>construction this is where obviously<br>there's that in between<br>now we've got digital side of things and<br>we've got the intent of what the<br>engineer wants to do or the architect<br>wants to do<br>then we're moving this over to the site<br>where they've got the capability to<br>start utilizing that data out on site<br>and out<br>out of the office you'll probably hear a<br>lot of<br>bim so to speak and bim being<br>a big buzzword around at the moment<br>digital engineering<br>is another one um essentially all these<br>are is<br>enabling the office to put information<br>into<br>into a file and that file being shared<br>out to site<br>and being able to be modified and sort<br>of added to as it goes on<br>by the end of it you've got a fully<br>working live digital twin i suppose is<br>the best<br>operation this is basically<br>basically the last stage of the digital<br>strategy for us um<br>when it comes to setting out or being<br>able to monitor different elements so<br>let's say for instance<br>um you've got an earthquake down south<br>we wanted to monitor where buildings are<br>and where buildings are situated we can<br>then monitor<br>that opposed to where it was a year ago<br>and see how far things have settled how<br>thick far things have moved<br>and we can also monitor things for if it<br>exceeds a certain amount of time or<br>exceeds a certain amount of distance<br>away from a certain point<br>um we can easily monitor that and get<br>warnings and alarm bells<br>it's basically the end of our digital<br>strategy<br>so for today i'll just literally quickly<br>run through these i'm<br>not going to take much time i know<br>obviously you guys came out of a heavy<br>meeting so that's<br>completely fine um digitizing<br>construction<br>on the software side for trimble<br>obviously it starts off with sketchup<br>then moves into tecla tecla amd triple<br>connect<br>and power fad power fab's being<br>localized for australian new zealand at<br>the moment<br>um it's essentially a fabrication<br>management system and we can uh<br>might touch on that a little bit later<br>and then we've got our field solutions<br>so<br>supposed for today we're focusing on<br>those first two parts<br>of the constructable solution<br>we're working on the design and then the<br>construction side<br>and how that interrupts interacts<br>now this is a slide that you may have<br>seen before or you may see in the future<br>um essentially the reason that's<br>different<br>is the fact that we can substitute any<br>of these so we've got sketchup and<br>technique here i'm not sure if you can<br>see my mouse<br>sketchup and tackling the authoring<br>software transition of data<br>fabrication process field solutions and<br>so forth then we can loop that all the<br>way back around<br>in regards to creating a digital twin<br>that's<br>first and foremost the biggest factor is<br>backwards compatibility<br>uh there's no point getting to somewhere<br>and then not being able to continue or<br>finish that off<br>now the biggest advantage of this and<br>this will come up at the end as well<br>is the fact that sketchup and tecla you<br>can just rip those out<br>throw in a bentley product or throw in<br>anything else and it'll still work<br>having that end-to-end solution and then<br>back to the start again<br>is first and foremost the most important<br>thing when you're thinking about<br>um sketchup you guys are probably<br>familiar with that<br>it's a 3d conceptual modeling package<br>that can model anything that you put you<br>put your mind to<br>um obviously information that's put in<br>here can<br>be used for architecture there's<br>elements like plus spec which is a<br>basically an add-in protect for<br>basically sketchup itself<br>and that will automate all the all the<br>walls and<br>so forth for any ordering um it's very<br>powerful<br>in regards to how open it is<br>moving that into tecla structures that's<br>a little bit of a<br>crappy image but essentially it's a 3d<br>modeling package that takes it from<br>from sketchup or rabbit or some so forth<br>and adds that<br>extra element of detail so it really<br>takes a<br>let's say a revit model from a lod 250<br>or led 300<br>into something that's actually<br>constructable<br>so we can do scheduling logistics<br>obviously you can see that there on the<br>top<br>there is a crane it's not just the<br>heifer look we can actually do<br>crane utilization ratios based on where<br>tower cranes are situated and how many<br>how many elements can be picked up from<br>certain pickup locations<br>um poor management and planning formwork<br>reinforcing anchors and layout as well<br>and obviously quantity takeoffs which is<br>on a second to none um layout is a big<br>thing when it comes to this<br>constructable workflow<br>layout enables those guys out on site to<br>tap into this 3d model<br>environment and actually start setting<br>out in real<br>in real world coordinates out on site so<br>a lot of surveyors will do<br>we'll use this with obviously the sx10<br>there<br>you can see that there you can see it by<br>basically shooting a laser<br>across the field and seeing where things<br>um localization essentially i mentioned<br>before about add-ins for sketchup these<br>are basically the add-ins<br>for tecla structures uh it's very<br>similar to that of like an autodesk<br>for families um except these are<br>basically more on the<br>on the um constructable side so<br>obviously you're<br>doing a lot more connections a lot more<br>rebar<br>a d um i won't touch too much on these<br>but essentially it's the grabbing that<br>model file see<br>at the moment we've gone from sketchup<br>conceptual detailed the model<br>now we're moving into a design phase or<br>analysis phase is probably what this one<br>is<br>um and analyzing the model as is um<br>structural designer and ted's earthquake<br>analysis the whole load<br>it can do whatever you your heart<br>desires as well<br>trimble connect um is now that now we're<br>into that little middle phase<br>of the constructable process um it's<br>been designed it's been<br>um detailed now we're basically just<br>about to transition this out onto site<br>now throwing it into trimble connect can<br>enable it's basically like a bim 360 for<br>those that are<br>in the autodesk sort of scenario um<br>works very similar<br>similarly similarly um<br>except the problem is with auto with the<br>autodesk platform it doesn't really go<br>to that next step<br>where this one will go into those site<br>profiles and site<br>basically a little diagram there for you<br>revit model take my model all into the<br>one<br>platform where people can view it<br>as i mentioned triple connect doesn't<br>stop there it goes into surveying tools<br>field solutions with an rpt here<br>goes back into the software and also the<br>now field solutions not so sure how far<br>into these you guys would look into uh<br>but essentially<br>um 3d laser scanners of any any kind is<br>literally<br>a device that sits on a tripod in the<br>middle of a room<br>shoots millions and billions of points<br>and essentially picks up<br>colors from photos as well um<br>on the left here you can see a 3d model<br>that's basically it<br>stitched together all these scans you<br>can see all these yellow lines that's<br>where the stations have been moved in<br>between<br>creating that will then create a<br>basically a mesh or<br>points which is then used to go<br>from a scan to bim scenario or even used<br>as a<br>as con scenario as well scan laser<br>scanning<br>at the moment is being obviously used to<br>scan it<br>and then essentially model straight<br>after that<br>where the way we're looking at things is<br>if you're scanning it<br>and then you're modeling it you're<br>probably doubling up your work and in<br>basically increasing that chance of<br>error as well um<br>there's no way you'll be able to get to<br>the same amount of detail as this 3d<br>laser scan because it can pick up<br>and pick up lights it can pick up power<br>points you can pick up anything<br>so for us we tend to<br>try and push people not to do the 3d<br>model<br>because you can use the point cloud the<br>same way<br>on the right we've got a remote setup<br>tool again<br>shooting lasers pointing out towards<br>where things are meant to be<br>part of this end sort of condition is<br>the fact that you can actually start<br>laser scanning<br>through it into connect and also throw<br>that into tecla as well<br>you can also throw that into revit<br>and also take this into novice folks as<br>well<br>field solutions as well for set out<br>again you can see<br>staff with this with the tripod and the<br>rpt there<br>he's basically setting out and checking<br>where all these<br>all these bolts all these starter bolts<br>now our x7 laser scanner you can see<br>here um we've got spot the dog<br>um boston dynamics creation<br>uh basically every time this dog sits<br>down it'll start a laser scan so<br>sooner or later we won't actually need<br>tripods and we won't need people out on<br>site<br>which at the moment over in new zealand<br>could be quite quite handy<br>you just send a robotic dog out and make<br>sure that things get done<br>laser scanning is a big fat factor of um<br>basically there's a project in auckland<br>where laser scans being used<br>for dilapidation reports um it was the<br>one that was heavily<br>fire damaged so that's that's a process<br>that's uh<br>being used at the moment uh that's<br>basically a qa and qc<br>process<br>a quick little video there i'm not sure<br>if this will work<br>every time from these a little bit<br>but i might just send these to back here<br>these can be sent out as well<br>uh literally just little videos about<br>the rpt<br>and the x7 laser scanner i think this is<br>yeah it's just a little bit of<br>informational video<br>and if you're looking at the x7 laser<br>scanner or any sort of laser scanner<br>um feel free we can definitely get one<br>of our technical guys<br>out and uh basically to show you guys<br>what it can do<br>and um educate uh people on<br>essentially anything on the digital side<br>so anything on the<br>3d laser scanning uh whether there's<br>virtual reality or mixed reality we can<br>definitely educate that<br>we don't really have much on the virtual<br>reality and i'll go through the mixed<br>reality in a second<br>essentially you can definitely take you<br>guys around me<br>for anyone actually we can take around<br>the laser scanning and the<br>field solution scenario and how these<br>work<br>and layout tools basically the same but<br>it's not working<br>that's right all right so now we move<br>into<br>um basically we've got the model we've<br>constructed the model or we're just<br>about to construct the model these can<br>go<br>either or either side augmented reality<br>so<br>this is site vision site vision is a<br>basic catalyst antenna or gps on top of<br>the<br>top of a phone and enables us to produce<br>the 3d model straight onto where things<br>are situated<br>we can start measuring points once we've<br>got the geo location of the model and<br>geolocation of<br>us we can start measuring as well we can<br>also<br>start to drape designs as you can see<br>here on the left<br>drape design files like dwgs out<br>straight onto the<br>now that was augmented reality now we've<br>got the mixed reality<br>in the office um we can basically wear<br>hard hats or we can wear it or basically<br>an xr10 or a<br>whole lens too and we can view any<br>sketchup models or any model itself<br>itself in our office and we can also do<br>it in more of a boardroom sense<br>site vision is more on outside and<br>on-site scenario<br>one is to one scale where the xr10 is<br>literally<br>a file format that can be scaled<br>it's actually a device that can be uh<br>collaborated as well so people can be in<br>separate offices and you can see the<br>again just head eye tracking it's<br>basically the hololens too so if you<br>guys are<br>familiar with any of that essentially<br>it's a<br>mixed reality headset um maybe one<br>headset as well is included so what that<br>is is actually a bone conducting headset<br>on the back of your<br>neck and basically transition transition<br>sound waves or basement um vibrations<br>into what sounds are and you can wear<br>so that's it's very quick um<br>feel free once travel opens up again i'd<br>love to come down and sort of show you<br>guys hands on what these can<br>what is people and how we can use all<br>this but essentially<br>authoring software transition data<br>fabrication process and field solutions<br>is literally the digitizing the<br>construction workflow um<br>swapping out in either of these is quite<br>easy<br>and that's something that we're looking<br>forward to in the future that<br>is going to be helping everyone and<br>helping construction sites<br>provide a lot more clarity when it comes<br>to construction<br>and a lot more sustainability when it<br>comes to how we can operate as well<br>thank you cool<br>thank you jason um i think everyone<br>could give a<br>virtual clap in your reaction it's<br>always<br>this very old kind of dynamic at the end<br>of a presentation<br>but thank you very much for that um any<br>oh<br>yeah i have yep got quite a few<br>questions actually<br>thanks regan that's that's great well no<br>jason really interesting really<br>interesting stuff how much is it<br>how much is the x7 how much for that<br>little gps on your hand phone<br>that sounds like a university discussion<br>about you know<br>oh it's not about price but we're trying<br>to reorganize this<br>it's not about how much things cost it's<br>about how how often things are meant to<br>be replaced<br>but um so if say one was thinking about<br>you know having one how much would it<br>cost so you're looking so<br>for an x7 laser scanner um laser<br>scanners can vary anywhere between<br>thirty thousand dollars for um there's<br>such things as leica blks uh which is<br>basically the size of<br>probably half the size of a water bottle<br>um about half the way<br>probably the same size as a pint or a<br>schooner um if that's a little bit<br>easier to<br>determine the size of that um<br>that one yeah looking about 30k but then<br>you can go all the way up to like a<br>regal<br>which is a mining spec one for 300k<br>so it really depends on the application<br>our ones look at 70k<br>for the x7 automatic registration<br>the whole lot um it's quite comparable<br>to a lot of other<br>software a lot of other hardwares um it<br>also comes with<br>the trimble software what about that<br>cute one with the gps on the hand phone<br>yeah yep<br>yep so you're looking so that one there<br>so let's bring your own phone<br>um the gps itself is all included um<br>it's all included on subscription base<br>so the site version itself<br>now you'd be looking at don't quote me<br>on this new zealand dollar is a little<br>bit uh<br>i need to throw that out there but i<br>think it's about eight and a half um<br>for the actual sight vision subscription<br>and the handset itself it's got also got<br>an edm laser<br>on it as well so basically you can start<br>measuring points<br>uh whether it be in the real world so<br>you're measuring to a wall<br>or you're measuring to a um to a model<br>element as well<br>so you can pick out points and stakeout<br>points<br>so what yeah it's a lot cheaper than<br>trying to get a surveyor out to a job<br>site and locating<br>pins every every couple of weeks because<br>the site's ever so changing<br>so you can uh definitely establish that<br>any other questions i i feel like<br>there's a heap of other people in the<br>school that would<br>have really be keen to listen to this so<br>i think your<br>thing is going to be well listened to<br>yeah when um when yeah as i said when<br>travel<br>opens up again i was actually meant to<br>come down and uh<br>or come over actually and show show a<br>lot of this off<br>um and explain what it all does and how<br>it all works<br>building a point question there jason um<br>before your like system is it<br>um interchangeable with other software<br>packages so say i just want to use your<br>laser scanner can i take that data<br>and then maybe go over to leica's<br>software or<br>yeah quarter disks yeah yeah we<br>previously used likers and they have<br>quite a<br>tight ecosystem where you're kind of<br>locked in so i was just wondering what<br>um tecla's kind of are you kind of<br>locked in<br>no no you're not locked in so we can so<br>what you can do is<br>inside that tablet so basically you can<br>load up a 3d model onto the<br>onto the trimble tablet essentially you<br>can load up a revit model onto there<br>you can take that out to site start geo<br>referencing your laser scan straight off<br>that<br>you can take that laser data and<br>actually take it back into<br>now this works revit or any bentley<br>products<br>yeah completely open and um you're<br>talking<br>about the project up in auckland yep um<br>do you know of any other projects in new<br>zealand that are starting to use<br>your stuff not off the top of my head um<br>there is<br>yeah there they are about um i'm not top<br>of my head though<br>okay let me um yeah let's see if i can<br>dig up actually<br>excellent well thank you guys thanks for<br>the time um<br>appreciate having me along and hopefully<br>uh yeah<br>once travel comes up i can all meet you<br>all in person eventually<br>yeah it's a weird little time that we're<br>situated in isn't it<br>oh sure sure is well thank you very much<br>together<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
