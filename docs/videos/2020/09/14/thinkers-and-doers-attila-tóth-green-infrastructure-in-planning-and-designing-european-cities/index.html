Today, Green Infrastructure is one of the main environmental and landscape strategies of the European Union, which is currently also supported through the European Green Deal and the new European Union (EU) Biodiversity Strategy.<br><br>Green infrastructure is an effective planning and design tool for landscape architects and urban designers to make our cities more sustainable and resilient in the field of climate change mitigation, biodiversity enhancement, and food security. The lecture will provide insight into the origins of planning urban green systems, an overview of current EU policies in this field, and show innovative planning and design strategies and nature-based solutions of green infrastructure in European Cities.<br><br>Dr Attila Tóth is a landscape architect based in Slovakia, with a research focus on green infrastructure planning and design in urban and rural landscapes. He studied in Slovakia and Austria, did research on urban green infrastructure planning in Germany and Austria, and conducted two scientific missions in New Zealand. He is assistant professor of landscape architecture at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, chair of LE:NOTRE Institute, and chair of IFLA Europe’s Working Group on Green Infrastructure. He holds the Green Talents Award, two European Council of Landscape Architecture Schools (ECLAS) Awards, and the Slovak Science and Technology Award.<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students, and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>warm greetings to everyone who is<br>joining us here in new zealand but also<br>from across the globe<br>it's very nice to look at our list of<br>participants<br>and see how diverse it is<br>it is my pleasure to welcome you to the<br>lecture of<br>attila taught as part of our lecture<br>series of thinkers and viewers<br>for those that do not know me my name is<br>bruno marquez<br>and i am the program director for the<br>landscape architecture program<br>at victoria university of wellington<br>our thinkers endures lecture series aims<br>at bringing together practitioners<br>scholars students and the wider<br>community of landscape architecture<br>and affiliated builds environment<br>disciplines<br>to share ideas and to hear the lightest<br>innovations in the field<br>this is an initiative that started<br>between the new zealand institute of<br>landscape architects our wellington<br>branch<br>and our landscape program at victoria<br>university<br>our ninth speaker at taylor thought<br>is a landscape architect based in<br>slovakia<br>with a research focus on green<br>infrastructure planning and design<br>at urban and rural levels he studied<br>in slovakia in austria and did research<br>on<br>urban green infrastructure planning in<br>germany and austria<br>and conducted two scientific missions to<br>new zealand<br>he is an assistant professor of<br>landscape architecture at the slovak<br>university of agriculture in nature<br>he is also the chair of the lunar<br>institute<br>and the chair of the ifla europe working<br>group on green infrastructure<br>he also has been awarded<br>the green talents award and two of the<br>european council of landscape<br>architecture schools awards<br>as well as the slovak science and<br>technology award<br>so his lecture will be titled green<br>infrastructure<br>in planning and design urban european<br>cities<br>which looks at green infrastructure as<br>one of the main environmental<br>and landscape strategies of the european<br>union<br>which is currently also supported<br>through the european green deal<br>and the new european union biodiversity<br>strategy<br>as we all know green infrastructure is<br>an effective planning<br>and design tool for landscape architects<br>and urban designers to make our cities<br>more sustainable and resilient<br>in dealing with climate change<br>mitigation biodiversity enhancement<br>and food security so the lecture will<br>provide us a short historical<br>review to the origins of planning urban<br>green systems<br>an overview of current eu policies in<br>these fields<br>and also shows innovative planning and<br>design strategies and nature-based<br>solutions of green infrastructure<br>across europe just very brief<br>housekeeping rules<br>do not forget that attila will be<br>sharing his screen<br>so keep this window open so you can<br>actually see his slides<br>also please remind me to try to talk to<br>minimize any background noise<br>and there will be plenty of time at the<br>end for you to ask your questions either<br>verbally or you can write them<br>in a chat box so please join me<br>in welcoming attila all the way from<br>slovakia<br>oh thank you bruno for introducing me<br>good evening to everyone from my<br>perspective and good morning to everyone<br>at the other end of the world<br>uh it's a pleasure for me to be<br>in new zealand again although virtually<br>this time<br>and i've prepared my slides uh<br>especially<br>i shall say to non-europeans uh<br>i will try to introduce the listeners to<br>the concept of<br>green infrastructure mainly from the<br>european perspective<br>of planning and design i've done a<br>short excursions to history<br>now i will start my slides maybe it<br>takes some time so<br>just please let me know if you can see<br>my slides now<br>yes and i'm now trying to put it to full<br>screen<br>do you see the full screen now yes okay<br>great<br>so uh what i've prepared today is the<br>short excuses to the historical<br>development of green infrastructure<br>concepts<br>reaching all the way back to the 19th<br>century and providing a short overview<br>of 20th century approaches<br>and then i will show different examples<br>of green infrastructure planning<br>in cities and city regions across europe<br>and also some good examples of green<br>infrastructure<br>design and implementation in different<br>cities<br>of course if you will have any<br>particular questions we can<br>discuss them uh at the discussion part<br>in the end of the presentation<br>so um what is grain infrastructure<br>one might say it's an old whiny new<br>bottle<br>as uh many authors do say uh<br>green infrastructure is a conception<br>which certainly is older<br>than a couple of years<br>and it started already in the 19th<br>century its development is well<br>um integrated and linked with<br>industrialization<br>and it it was of course not called<br>green infrastructure at that time but<br>you will see some conceptions<br>which follow more or less the same idea<br>uh<br>like green infrastructure has behind but<br>of course<br>it uh has a different uh structure and<br>different naming<br>so uh let me allow to start<br>this historical excursions with this uh<br>illustration by cedric price an<br>architect from<br>the uk uh explaining how<br>european cities looked like you can see<br>the<br>ancient city which is uh much like a<br>boiled egg<br>next to it there is the modern city of<br>the 17th and 19th century so mainly in<br>the period of industrialization<br>where which looks like a fried egg this<br>was the time when the<br>city structures changed the city walls<br>the protection walls have been<br>removed and the city started to grow<br>outside the<br>the historical walls uh still the<br>the ancient core of the city has<br>remained<br>and modern cities of the uh late 19th<br>and<br>20s or 21st century look much like a<br>scrambled egg<br>because you are not<br>you are not able to identify historic<br>course<br>anymore and this is the case of many<br>rebuilt cities of<br>the post-war period<br>the conception of greening cities<br>reaches back to conceptions like<br>la ciudad lineal where you can see green<br>strips and green lines<br>along which streetscapes have been<br>organized<br>and perhaps a little bit more uh<br>well-known is the garden cities of<br>tomorrow concept by<br>ebenezer howard who was an urban planner<br>active in the late 19th century<br>and who came up with the conception of<br>guardian cities of tomorrow this<br>conception tried to<br>link the qualities of the rural with the<br>qualities of<br>the urban and the city model<br>included allotments for instance or a<br>grand<br>green avenue and the central park so the<br>city<br>was much linked with so to say rural<br>areas which we shall understand as green<br>spaces and open spaces<br>uh there are also other forms of<br>green infrastructure planning and this<br>uh<br>this is for instance the green rings and<br>the green belts<br>you can see examples from vienna on the<br>left and from london<br>on the right this<br>eccentric way of planning cities or<br>modeling cities was quite popular in<br>most of uh european<br>metropolitan cities uh for instance<br>vienna<br>had this green ring along it which had a<br>protection<br>uh meaning before in the<br>in the medieval times and of course in<br>modern times when<br>this protection function was done then<br>the concepts of what to do with this<br>area<br>arose and this made the way<br>to for ringstrasse for the famous green<br>ring<br>uh all along the historical city core<br>to arise london was similar<br>there was a plan of the green belts<br>along london and several green belts<br>divided different urban strips of the<br>city<br>another example is the finger plan from<br>copenhagen<br>where you can see the example when<br>nature<br>enters the city and creates fingers or<br>green veggies like you can see here<br>on this example so uh green green<br>veggies were very<br>popular in in planning conceptions as<br>well<br>if the geography of the city allowed<br>this approach later on in the<br>19 in the second half of the 20th<br>century<br>uh it was uh uh the the period of<br>environmentalism<br>and different environmental movements<br>and in this period uh<br>also the so-called ecological networks<br>developed<br>for instance also in uh czechoslovakia<br>there was the<br>landscape ecological planning uh or<br>uh territorial system of ecological<br>stability<br>and the ecological network conception<br>was<br>more or less international it bases on<br>different core areas and landscape<br>corridors but<br>the significance of this approach is<br>more<br>in the ecology<br>green infrastructure is a more<br>modern or let's say a more noble<br>approach this reaches back in some<br>perspectives also<br>to the garden city of tomorrow from the<br>european<br>uh area but also from north american<br>space<br>it reaches back to to the parkways and<br>the emerald necklace by frederick law<br>olmsted<br>and you can see here<br>an explanatory image of green<br>infrastructure as a planning conception<br>a very important aspect of crane<br>infrastructure<br>in uh today's understanding is the<br>multifunctionality so it's not only<br>about ecology<br>but it has a very strong social<br>dimension and a very strong<br>economic dimension we have a green<br>infrastructure strategy<br>at the eu level which is linked with all<br>other strategies and policies for<br>instance also with the common<br>agricultural policy<br>or the new eu biodiversity strategy<br>and more recently the so-called green<br>deal<br>which is an economic concept based on<br>green or<br>environmental approaches to renew<br>europe as such in a rather sustainable<br>and green way<br>and this conception is very well linked<br>with uh<br>more modern approaches like the<br>nature-based solutions<br>which we shall understand as part of a<br>wider image which<br>should be creamy infrastructure and all<br>these provide<br>ecosystem services so these free terms<br>are very<br>uh birds uh today uh<br>for the european commission and also for<br>national uh<br>authorities now i will show you some<br>examples of regional and urban<br>landscapes where green infrastructure is<br>integrated<br>at the european level i must<br>mention the european green belt this is<br>a very interesting project as you might<br>recall<br>after the second world war europe was<br>divided to east and west<br>and the east and west was divided by the<br>so-called<br>iron curtain after the end of the cold<br>war and the collapse of communism<br>this iron curtain gradually turned into<br>a european green belt actually this<br>process started already during<br>during the cold war because this was a<br>no enter zone<br>for uh many of the countries and this<br>was of course very favorable<br>for the landscape and nature to uh<br>reclaim areas and now uh<br>it is one uh it is considered the<br>backbone<br>of the european green infrastructure and<br>it reaches<br>from the parent sea all the way down to<br>the mediterranean and the black sea<br>if we go back to metropolitan scales and<br>the<br>city region scales uh the<br>london example is very famous uh<br>you might recall my slide where i showed<br>you the<br>ring concept of london uh or the belt<br>concept of london which was re-thought<br>and redeveloped<br>more recently and now it is called the<br>green grid<br>so this understanding from the 19th<br>or early 20th century about the green<br>belts where there was a<br>distinct division between urban and<br>rural<br>and between built up and non-built up<br>nature<br>now we understand much more the needs of<br>creating grids and interconnecting<br>all the green areas and linking them<br>with the city as such<br>a good example is also the regio green<br>from cologne in germany<br>which was a concept trying to<br>enrich the the green system<br>of the city of cologne and you can see<br>the<br>the inner ring which is the historical<br>ring of cologne and<br>this was the uh medieval<br>city fortification here you can see<br>another green strip which was another<br>fortification of the larger city area<br>and now it is both green strips<br>and the third one it reaches already to<br>the rural<br>background and the rural uh<br>surroundings of the city and tries to<br>connect<br>these with strips diagonal strips which<br>connect each ring with with each other<br>now i will go through some of the<br>projects to show not only the planning<br>and the model level of green<br>infrastructure as a concept but also to<br>show how green infrastructure or green<br>and blue<br>infrastructure are being implemented in<br>selected projects<br>all over europe one of my<br>favorite examples is parcliche bateno is<br>in paris<br>in france this was designed<br>by jacqueline ostie and this used to be<br>a railway railway some years ago when<br>they decided to redevelop the area<br>and they created a huge new urban park<br>and the whole railway station<br>was gone and now there is a big green<br>urban park<br>and the houses and the residential areas<br>in the surroundings of the park have<br>been developed step by step so the park<br>was one of the first developments<br>and this is the example or this is the<br>case of<br>uh also other projects which i am going<br>you can now see some examples from<br>parklichibatinolas<br>which is uh interesting uh in this<br>project is that it collects<br>rainwater from the rooftops of the<br>surrounding<br>residential buildings and also from all<br>all hard surfaces which are not<br>permeable to water<br>it connects it to channels and these<br>channels<br>are all connected with this<br>water surface where you can see<br>hydrophytes and hydrophytes<br>in the water so it's uh something like<br>a big uh perennial garden just on water<br>and uh here you can see on the top left<br>an<br>example of how such a channel<br>looks like with the hydrophytes planted<br>in it<br>it's all a closed circle which<br>circulates the water<br>and also adds some extra water if there<br>is a necessity in the draught periods<br>this part what you can see in the<br>bottom left this was developed later on<br>and also the buildings are newer and<br>also the park conception is newer than<br>this<br>original bigger part you can see also<br>the trees<br>that it is more grown area<br>and it is a very popular site for uh<br>people living around to do sports and<br>jogging<br>and different kinds of outdoor<br>activities<br>or just enjoying uh the beauty of the<br>perennial beds and the possibilities to<br>sit down and enjoy<br>the silence in the middle of the urban<br>jungle<br>a nice example is also the greenwich<br>peninsula ecology park in london<br>which is located in in the district of<br>greenwich<br>and the interesting is that<br>they took the water from the river<br>thames and<br>they are using it to create<br>a unique park and join it also with the<br>nearby residential<br>area so instead of loans which you might<br>normally have<br>at residential estates like this one you<br>have<br>water surfaces and also reed<br>and trees and small<br>areas for the wildlife to to find<br>some ecotops to live in and what is very<br>important and i think also very<br>attractive element of this park is that<br>they are<br>also educating the public as you can see<br>on the right and show them<br>what kind of plants and trees<br>are planted in this ecological park<br>and what kind of animals do live here<br>with them<br>and this is uh the part already in the<br>ecological park which is<br>just next to the residential area you<br>can see for instance uh<br>that all you need here is read and vood<br>and you are just walking through the<br>ecological park<br>you have the possibility to observe<br>birds<br>which found a place to live<br>in the ecological park and you have also<br>plenty of elements for insects but also<br>for people<br>and instead of a path system a regular<br>path system you have for instance<br>such wooden platforms<br>and wooden bulbs on the about the<br>water surface so you can enjoy the water<br>in the residential area right where you<br>live<br>a similar conception is also<br>tamil arbi in stockholm which is<br>although different in scale and you can<br>see<br>examples how water is brought<br>into the residential area and combined<br>with possibilities to walk<br>in the reed and get close to the water<br>or sit down close to the water so this<br>is very attractive for the urban<br>citizens who can<br>live just at the water and of course<br>this<br>development caused that also the price<br>and the value<br>of the residential areas and of the<br>flats located in this residential area<br>of the ciusta<br>are very high and very good<br>for the owners uh you can see another<br>example of sagetta<br>aspen this is a newer development in<br>vienna<br>this used to be formerly a um a small<br>airport a field or airfield<br>and what they started the development<br>with<br>was creating this water surface here<br>and also joining it with the city<br>through<br>uh metro so this was the<br>very important step uh to start with uh<br>joining the city<br>uh with this uh district of zestat<br>uh with with the metro line uh<br>creating uh green open spaces with the<br>water surface<br>and then they started to develop the<br>housing estates all along uh<br>what they are doing still now so<br>this district is still growing and still<br>changing<br>in time so what you can see here uh<br>is different now already uh this uh this<br>was a temporary installment<br>uh for people to enjoy the waterfront<br>and here you can see the metro station<br>on the uh<br>top left so you can arrive to the<br>district<br>without the necessity of having a car<br>this makes the district very popular<br>and you can of course use also the green<br>and blue spaces<br>when we are talking about water another<br>important<br>element in urban or another<br>important aspect in urban landscapes is<br>the storm water management<br>a good example of this is the park<br>from brno in czech republic uh<br>it's called park port blacktammy and it<br>used to be<br>a typical settlement from the second<br>half of the 20th century this type of<br>residential estates was built in the<br>1960s 70s and 80s<br>this is uh the so-called social realism<br>and many people lived<br>in such flights or they originally moved<br>from rural areas to urban areas and they<br>started to live in flats<br>and the centralized planning system<br>in czechoslovakia or other countries in<br>the eastern block of europe<br>there following the approach of<br>centralized planning and there was<br>normally<br>in terms of quantity quite<br>enough green spaces but in terms of<br>quality<br>their quality standards were not really<br>high<br>and now they are being redeveloped and<br>in this case in the<br>park in czech republic they started to<br>collect all the water<br>which um which ended originally in the<br>sewage system<br>they collected it to a central uh<br>water surface in the middle and now it<br>became<br>element of the the open space<br>being in europe uh it's also important<br>to talk about traffic<br>uh sometimes traffic cuts uh uh cities<br>from their<br>landscapes and nature uh a good example<br>of this is the rio manzanares river in<br>madrid<br>uh where there was approximately six<br>kilometers<br>of highway which cut the city of madrid<br>from its river manzanares there were<br>several strips of<br>a heavy road so people were not really<br>able to<br>uh get uh just close to the river and<br>enjoy the riverfront<br>and the concept of rio manzanar is<br>developed by<br>west 8th which is a famous<br>dutch office i guess most of you will<br>know it<br>they developed the conception of a new<br>river park where they put<br>the highway below the ground all the six<br>kilometers approximately<br>and they created the novel urban park<br>on the top of it which some<br>critics called like a modern baroque<br>because of<br>this ornamental shapes<br>but the the the truth is here<br>that uh actually this project helped to<br>reconnect the city with its river<br>and to create attractive open spaces you<br>can see parts of the river<br>and interesting examples of<br>how the river is managed and how it is<br>used to<br>in many cities uh you have uh<br>large and attractive open green spaces<br>and the very good example for this is<br>the rudolph bednar park in vienna<br>uh i like to give this example<br>especially because<br>the first thing in the development was<br>to start with the park<br>now you have residential houses all<br>along<br>and around the park but they started the<br>development of a new district which used<br>to be<br>also a railway station a big railway<br>station<br>they started this development with this<br>urban park there was an international<br>competition which was won by<br>um hugger landscape architect from<br>switzerland<br>and they developed this concept of the<br>rudolph bednar park with a very strong<br>linearity and when the<br>last houses around the park where built<br>the trees were already quite nicely<br>grown and the space was already very<br>popular<br>and used by the public<br>you can see some examples here so these<br>houses in the background were not there<br>when the park was already built<br>and an interesting feature of the park<br>is that they<br>left or kept one of the popular trees<br>which<br>was there originally before the<br>development started<br>you can still see in the background uh<br>construction going on<br>around the park so the city district is<br>growing<br>and the park is already there for people<br>to enjoy<br>the green space skip hole airport in<br>amsterdam is a good example of how<br>to deal with large traffic<br>infrastructure<br>like an airport is in many cases<br>and they planted uh hundreds of uh birch<br>trees<br>in the airport area and uh all<br>all of you who are traveling a lot and<br>uh<br>or used to be traveling a lot before<br>before the current situation um<br>you you know the situation that where<br>when you are at an airport<br>uh you quite often are not able to use<br>open spaces you are most of the time<br>inside the airport building but at skip<br>hall airport<br>you are allowed to go outside and enjoy<br>the open green spaces and the water<br>features so this is also enhancing the<br>quality<br>of an infrastructure like an airport<br>and here you can see some of the birch<br>trees which were planted<br>this was also designed by west aid and<br>you can see a good examples of how you<br>can use<br>spaces like<br>road infrastructure where you normally<br>are not<br>able to place anything<br>very useful but you can still use it<br>as a park if you choose the right<br>materials<br>and the right trees to place there<br>i'm going back to the original<br>structure to the regional green system<br>of<br>cologne which i showed already when i<br>was talking about<br>cityscape planning or about the<br>cp region planning of green spaces<br>this is a very good example where you<br>can see the two<br>rings the two green belts of cologne<br>uh the one is the inner one this is uh<br>typical with uh historical park<br>some of them reaching back to the 19th<br>and 20th century<br>and this strip is more multifunctional<br>with different sorts of parks of<br>different kind<br>and an example which i want to highlight<br>there are two parks<br>both of them located in the outer ring<br>of the city of cologne one of them is<br>called<br>the landscape park belvedere which is<br>located here and it is<br>known as an agrarian or agricultural<br>park<br>there was a competition called for this<br>area<br>to redevelop the site because what you<br>can see here<br>is a highway on this side here on the<br>left<br>and on the right you can see already<br>some of the outskirts of the city of<br>cologne which is mainly<br>individual housing but also collective<br>housing<br>and here there was some kind of leftover<br>agricultural space<br>and you can imagine agricultural open<br>spaces<br>or are under a very high pressure<br>all over europe and especially in such<br>big cities like cologne<br>and of course there was a pressure to<br>build up this area<br>but the citizens of these<br>housing estates and of this individual<br>housing<br>close to this agricultural area said we<br>want to have a park we<br>want to have an urban park for<br>recreation and for leisure<br>we don't want to have any more<br>development so there was a competition<br>and it was won by um by lord bergst<br>atlantic<br>architectu which is a name<br>of the design studio which covers<br>um city landscapes so<br>he's focusing especially on city<br>landscapes<br>and uh lordberg is also specialist in<br>urban agriculture<br>so the winning concept what they<br>submitted was that<br>they combined agriculture with park<br>so agriculture did not have to end in<br>this site<br>on one hand and the new park could<br>arise and citizens could use this spark<br>and how they made it they created<br>a unique area as you can see here<br>agriculture is still ongoing in some 300<br>hectares<br>you can see these areas<br>here this is active agriculture<br>what they uh created is a<br>good network for cyclists and<br>pedestrians<br>in the whole park uh for people to uh<br>do exercises or or to<br>just spend their leisure time and they<br>added<br>also different uh differently high<br>and with a very nice architecture such<br>viewing towers like you can see here<br>and the different height of this viewing<br>towers<br>enables visitors to see different levels<br>of the agricultural landscape<br>the one with wide views and<br>overviewing the typical structure of a<br>rebel lens<br>and the lowest one is really just a few<br>centimeters about<br>the rebel end so you can see the crops<br>themselves and this turned out to be<br>very popular for people they go<br>cycling here with children<br>and also what they do is come to observe<br>harvesting or seeding<br>so different uh periods of the<br>agricultural<br>year and also very important part is<br>this<br>ecostrips along the path systems what<br>you can see here<br>and there is also um an information for<br>all the visitors stating that your<br>farmer does something for biodiversity<br>uh here you can see one of the viewing<br>towers uh<br>the middle size one where uh an observer<br>can<br>see the the whole agricultural area<br>and enjoy the view of<br>the typical agricultural landscape in<br>different parts of the year<br>another example from cologne is the<br>so-called for forest lab wildlabor<br>uh this was uh also a competition<br>where the city wanted to do uh<br>do a new park and the challenge was to<br>develop something new<br>something novel and then the forest lab<br>conception came up and in this<br>forest lab or forest park they are<br>testing different<br>uh types of green uh<br>fuzz uh trees and so<br>fast-growing woody plants which they<br>uh gradually harvest so the entire space<br>of the forest is changing from time to<br>time<br>and they are also testing the<br>adaptability of different<br>uh wooded plant species to climate<br>change<br>how they react and how fast they can<br>grow<br>and how they react to draught periods<br>and so on<br>so this is not just an open space but it<br>is also a<br>living lab at the same time and you can<br>see<br>here how the space looks like when the<br>um when the fast-growing<br>uh trees this uh this is the salix the<br>below<br>uh and it creates uh typical<br>uh inner spaces um and uh<br>here are some land art elements which<br>were created by students in a workshop<br>so the site is very dynamic and very<br>changeable<br>and people can enjoy this different type<br>and now i'm uh getting close to the end<br>of my presentation and i will<br>go through some different types of green<br>spaces<br>especially on roofs and walls uh or<br>highways<br>and even a vertical park<br>uh we have many brown fields<br>especially in countries where industry<br>was well developed<br>here are some examples from germany and<br>from italy<br>you know that the ruer area in northwest<br>germany<br>was a very productive industrial area in<br>the 19th and 20th century<br>and after the intensive production<br>stopped<br>many new brown fields occurs so the<br>amscir landscape park<br>in the north rhine westphalia region of<br>germany<br>is very rich in size of this kind you<br>can see<br>two examples here this is uh the<br>soulferin essen<br>and the other one is the launch of spark<br>north the landscape park north<br>in duisburg bulls used to be<br>active factories till the 1980s i think<br>and then they were redeveloped uh into<br>new parks<br>and uh to to make it more sustainable<br>and also to<br>keep the industrial heritage of the site<br>uh most of the structures and<br>constructions<br>have been kept so you can still see them<br>in the the open space and<br>these sparks and these concepts work<br>a lot with designed<br>succession and they use reuteral<br>vegetation<br>or spontaneous vegetation and they<br>implement it in the concept of<br>the the park on a long run and there is<br>an example<br>from torino from italy<br>where in one picture you can see<br>also a redeveloped brownfield which is<br>the whole area<br>combined also with green walls<br>and green roofs of the administrative<br>some more examples of green roofs<br>this this example is from czech republic<br>this is a rooftop where you can also<br>sit and enjoy the the urban roof<br>landscape<br>this example on the top left is also<br>from<br>a post-industrial czech city of ostrava<br>where they created this extensive<br>rooftop<br>and this is uh one of the flagship<br>views of this area and very famous and<br>popular<br>and of course in many cases<br>roofs can be used also not just to be<br>extensively green but they can be also<br>intensively used<br>open spaces this is an example from<br>the university of greenwich in<br>uk but you can think<br>also about small scale training on<br>karachi's<br>this example is from germany also from<br>the rural area<br>many of the garages<br>are greened on their roofs and also in<br>many cases on the walls<br>but you can see also really tiny green<br>roofs<br>on stands for bicycles or on stands<br>for garbage bins uh where<br>there are tiny cream roofs created and<br>the green<br>surrounded by cream walls<br>but also uh you you can find different<br>types of uh<br>green balls i've selected examples from<br>madrid paris and vienna<br>uh this one is very famous in madrid<br>this is an example of a very intensive<br>green wall this needs of course a lot of<br>watering<br>but you have also rather more extensive<br>options this one is for instance from<br>vienna<br>this is a more extensive type of green<br>wall but also other types of vegetated<br>walls occur where the<br>sustainability also in terms of economy<br>and ecology<br>are more significant than the one uh<br>here which needs really a lot of<br>and of course if we uh talk about<br>large-scale<br>uh infrastructure we can give an example<br>of<br>eco-ducts where austria for instance is<br>really one of the flagship countries in<br>this<br>in europe they have compared to the size<br>of the country a<br>well-developed network of highways<br>and you can see all along the highways<br>such eco-ducts which allow the wildlife<br>to cross<br>this barrier in the landscape so this is<br>a very important<br>challenge also to many other countries<br>where highways<br>lack such eco ducts and<br>they become very significant barriers in<br>the landscape for the connectivity of<br>green infrastructure for<br>wildlife especially and i will end up<br>this round of examples of different<br>green<br>green infrastructure projects which<br>ought to inspire especially students of<br>landscape architecture about different<br>possibilities and perhaps give some<br>references if you want to go more into<br>depths in some of the projects<br>this is an example from zurich from<br>switzerland<br>which shows that the parks do not have<br>to be<br>one floor constructions even parks can<br>have several floors and they can be<br>like a residential building uh the mfo<br>park from zurich is a good example for<br>this<br>where in a relatively small scale<br>quite an uh a significant park was<br>created<br>uh you can see a constructed uh<br>a construction where green<br>uh where plants are over growing the<br>construction and creating a<br>green wall system and you can see<br>several<br>layers and several floors of the park<br>so the ground floor is used as a very<br>intensive meeting point and also for<br>shortening ways in the everyday city<br>landscape<br>so uh people can walk around<br>and through the park and this was very<br>important<br>uh to allow the use of this site so<br>therefore<br>there is not so much uh green space or<br>green surfaces<br>but they are using permeable surfaces<br>uh for the water to allow to enter the<br>ground<br>and they are compensating in this<br>project the green spaces which they<br>could not afford<br>to do on the ground floor but they did<br>it<br>on the vertical structures and also<br>on horizontal structures especially on<br>the<br>rooftop here you can see some views from<br>the<br>several floors and stories of the park<br>so you can just come on the balcony of<br>the park and enjoy the wii u's<br>in the space of the park and here you<br>can see<br>a seating option with a small water<br>feature<br>and what is interesting about this water<br>feature<br>you can see in the bottom of this<br>picture<br>that instead of gravel which it<br>looks on the first view on the first<br>side as a gravel<br>it is a recycled glass you can see<br>uh green and blue and white glass or<br>brown glass<br>so it is also a very nice accent<br>a very nice color accent in the space<br>and at the same time<br>it gives a sort of a sustainability<br>message<br>how we can smartly reuse some materials<br>and use it for<br>use it instead of gravel for instance in<br>this case<br>and here you are on the rooftop of the<br>park on the top<br>left picture and you can enjoy<br>the views in the surrounding city<br>landscape of<br>zurich<br>and here a last view into the park space<br>and i'm going to end up with a picture<br>from<br>london from a park where it says<br>keeps it is wild and i can agree with<br>the statement of course<br>we might discuss in to what extent in<br>which way<br>keeping cities wild but certainly<br>today's<br>approaches to city planning to to urban<br>design and landscape architecture<br>are working a lot<br>with ecology and nature and not against<br>it<br>so thank you for your attention and<br>thank you artila that was an excellent<br>lecture taking us<br>across europe and seeing all these very<br>interesting projects<br>and how they have um you know addressed<br>green infrastructure<br>um so now it's a time to open the floor<br>for questions<br>and as i said initially you can either<br>ask ask your question directly to<br>artillery by unmuting yourself<br>or if you feel a little shy you can<br>always type it<br>in the chat box and i will we will read<br>it<br>um giving you some time to prepare the<br>questions<br>i will just kick start by asking um<br>because you have been here in new<br>zealand twice by now<br>uh hopefully more in the future um<br>what's your what was your initial<br>reaction in terms of the strategies that<br>you<br>saw in new zealand and how those<br>um how much of those have actually<br>enhanced the green infrastructure of our<br>cities of our urban environments<br>was there anything that you felt<br>particularly<br>thank you for the question well yes i<br>was twice in new zealand once<br>it was some five or six years ago in<br>christchurch<br>in the south island and<br>last year it was in rotorua in north<br>island<br>and i was doing research in christchurch<br>on redeveloping the destroyed city<br>after earthquakes and focusing on the<br>urban resilience and the foodscapes<br>of the city of christchurch and last<br>year we<br>looked at the forest landscapes<br>in different parts of the north island<br>but with a focus on rotorua<br>so for me uh the my impression from new<br>zealand was that<br>uh the the landscape is completely<br>different so it's very exotic to a<br>european to come to new zealand<br>uh so what i uh was amazed<br>from was the um was the unique<br>landscape and the unique nature you have<br>so i think this is the largest<br>natural capital uh you you have to<br>keep in in mind in in planning and<br>design<br>uh and on the other hand i saw also<br>that new zealand is quite dependent on<br>uh card traffic uh so<br>uh once you don't have a car you you are<br>not really able to<br>get from a to b uh and this of course<br>influences also planning to very<br>large extent from my perspective so i<br>think<br>you can learn from some european<br>examples<br>which i consider relevant also also for<br>new zealand<br>and also very important is the the<br>agricultural landscape<br>uh because you you can keep your uh<br>cities um resilient<br>also in terms of food security<br>and i think there is a large tradition<br>in most of the cities and<br>in the north island i think also urban<br>forests<br>have a very big importance for<br>recreation but also for keeping the city<br>green<br>absolutely okay<br>i think i have to look to the chat box<br>somehow<br>because i only see my slides can i stop<br>sharing now<br>or i think you can<br>good<br>if anyone would like to ask a question<br>to attila directly<br>emma hi oh hi<br>good morning bruno you can hear me hi<br>um otilla i'm um my name's emma mcrae<br>i'm a landscape architect at<br>both of my school in wellington new<br>zealand um<br>not really a question just more of a<br>kind of observational<br>commentary i suppose on your your talk<br>in the beginning<br>you were talking about cities with green<br>belts<br>and i know in a lot of those areas<br>around the world particularly in london<br>um there's pressure on those green belt<br>areas<br>with the need for housing development<br>and i just wondered whether<br>i suppose the examples that you were<br>showing<br>were perhaps an example of how you could<br>accommodate that development within the<br>green belt without perhaps compromising<br>on those<br>yeah it's just well of course<br>yeah yeah especially in big cities like<br>london<br>and also other metropolitan cities you<br>uh have a very massive urban development<br>and<br>pressure on open spaces so<br>this is from my point of view very much<br>the question of priorities<br>and how the city approaches this topic<br>for instance the city of vienna<br>developed a<br>green and open space concept which<br>became a strategic part<br>of the urban development plan so this<br>is a concept or a strategy which the<br>city follows in its<br>development and also in other<br>austrian or german cities uh the green<br>space<br>are uh among the top priorities of the<br>city<br>uh so in each development they try to<br>identify the main elements of their<br>green infrastructure<br>the backbone of the green infrastructure<br>and the of the whole grid<br>and try to keep this also<br>if urban development happens they try to<br>place urban development in a way<br>that the green belts and the green<br>connections<br>uh do not get disturbed and<br>you you have different uh protection<br>status<br>for this uh you can use the national<br>protection but<br>in many cases cities do not have this<br>power<br>uh for everyday landscapes which are not<br>exceptional<br>ecological areas but they are important<br>open spaces<br>and many of the cities and<br>municipalities are using the possibility<br>of protecting their open green spaces<br>at the municipal level with uh their own<br>legislation tools which are<br>the municipal tools so i think<br>um city planning uh has a very<br>important role in this and also the um<br>the administrative<br>capacities of cities which are supposed<br>to give building permits<br>uh that they have clear<br>clear ideas about how to keep<br>the green share in in a city district<br>and if it is necessary how to keep open<br>spaces<br>in specific areas if they have a<br>strategic importance for the city as<br>such<br>thank you yeah i hope i answered your<br>question yeah well<br>yeah yeah no you did thank you<br>thank you emma um any other questions<br>i think probably the europeans are<br>well that's it it's 11 in here<br>hello hello uh i would like<br>hello attila it's nice to see you we<br>have the same time now i think<br>i am in poland and you're in slovakia<br>uh your lecture was<br>very interested and<br>i would like to ask you because you<br>because you are a specialist<br>of the green infrastructure and<br>we can we can notice<br>that the green<br>infrastructure it is not a<br>brand new ideology because<br>in 70s in 60s it was<br>also implemented in our cities<br>especially in poland i think in slovakia<br>in czech republic<br>also and uh how could you<br>uh describe the difference in<br>approach to design uh between<br>uh this approach in seventies and<br>the first ideas of of these<br>green belts of these fingers structure<br>was born we can see we can say<br>in 60s but now<br>the approach is a little bit different<br>well um as i mentioned in my<br>lecture um the the conception<br>of uh city-wide green space planning<br>reaches back<br>even to the 19th century with the first<br>attempts uh<br>if if we take it from north american<br>space it is<br>with the emerald necklace by frederick<br>law olmsted for instance<br>but also the the garden cities concept<br>and uh this uh came back<br>every time again and again<br>under a different name or a slightly<br>different approach<br>and what you are mentioning in the 60s<br>70s this was a<br>strong environmentalist movement and<br>environmental justice<br>in several countries and<br>it was particularly in western europe<br>with this environmentalist approaches<br>in eastern europe this came also<br>under different titles for instance in<br>czechoslovakia it was called the<br>landscape ecological planning<br>and uh this this approach was with a<br>very strong<br>ecological um focus<br>so if if we want to compare<br>green infrastructure from now<br>and from the 1960s or 70s<br>the focus in those concepts<br>was pretty much ecology today the focus<br>is uh also not not only ecology but it<br>has a pillar structure so one of the<br>pillars is<br>ecology but uh similarly or the same to<br>the same extent<br>important is also the economic pillar<br>of the concept and also the social<br>pillar of the concept<br>so if cities are developing<br>green infrastructure strategies and<br>concepts they not only look at<br>they not only look at the ecological<br>aspect<br>but also on how it can improve the<br>social structure<br>and the social diversification of the<br>city on one hand<br>and also how it can help uh in the<br>sustainable economic development of the<br>city<br>and now uh when most of the cities are<br>talking about the the green deal<br>they also and the new biodiversity<br>strategy of<br>eu we are talking about greening cities<br>so uh there is the need to to green the<br>cities<br>any further for the um against climate<br>change<br>as a climate adaptation uh measure<br>and uh also to improve the social<br>structure of the city<br>so i think uh this has changed from the<br>60s that was<br>also in the eastern bloc countries in<br>that uh time<br>uh this uh very rigid planning<br>approach with the exact numbers<br>to be planned and to be kept in<br>quantitative<br>measures where while the qualitative<br>criteria were not so important and today<br>we<br>much more look at also the quality of<br>the site<br>and uh also at the accessibility and the<br>availability of green spaces and their<br>thank you thank you and i think also<br>that we have<br>a lot barriers to<br>to to breach<br>above because because during this<br>90s and the first part of twenties 21st<br>century<br>a lot of barriers um appeared<br>at in in our cities yes thank you<br>thank you urusula um actually i think<br>we're probably going to stay here um so<br>i would like to<br>thank you for joining us virtually<br>to new zealand uh and also to<br>have such a diverse audience<br>i could see many names and not only from<br>europe but from<br>across the entire globe um thank you for<br>sharing your knowledge and expertise<br>with<br>with us i think was a very inspiring<br>lecture i'm sure we're all gonna get<br>um inspired with some great ideas on how<br>to bring<br>green infrastructure to our work<br>and so thank you very much on behalf of<br>victoria university and the new zealand<br>institute of landscape architects<br>and thank you everyone for joining us<br>this morning or this evening<br>whatever you are and i wish you all the<br>best<br>and i hope to see you again in two weeks<br>from now for our next<br>speaker okay thank you everyone for<br>listening<br>goodbye bye bye<br>oh well if anyone um<br>wants to um send me<br>some further questions because i see<br>that some some people are still typing<br>questions<br>you can find me on researchgate or<br>linkedin and we can connect up there and<br>discuss<br>bye<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
