a small town<br>outside of columbus<br>i'm jacob i'm from seattle and i'm<br>studying marketing<br>so my name is jordan i'm in my third<br>year of an undergraduate degree<br>bachelor of arts at victoria university<br>of wellington<br>i really loved coming to new zealand<br>because i grew up in the smoky mountains<br>in tennessee<br>and that was very hard for me to leave<br>leaving your family<br>is one thing you know that you're going<br>to see them again you can call them as<br>soon as you land<br>leaving the mountains was very different<br>for me<br>and when i arrived in new zealand i saw<br>all of the mountains<br>of new zealand and so it felt instantly<br>familiar to me comfortable i knew that i<br>was still protected<br>um and taken care of by mother earth<br>yeah i came here when i was little on<br>vacation and i fell in love with the<br>country.<br>My parents love to travel and they<br>always say you know where if you go<br>anywhere in the world i said oh back to<br>new zealand<br>we've been there i've got to go<br>somewhere else got to go back from new<br>zealand so when i had the opportunity to<br>study<br>internationally new zealand was my first<br>place to look<br>in terms of kiwi culture i think most<br>people i meet are pretty laid back and<br>chill<br>they're quite happy to go out for a cup<br>of coffee and have a chat with you have<br>a<br>yarn as they might say people are<br>generally really friendly and they want<br>to know things about you so i like that<br>my first impression of the university<br>when i came in was that it was very<br>harry potter-esque<br>because i think the first building i<br>came into was hunter building so that's<br>the old one<br>but i was just very excited and amazed<br>by the facilities here<br>it's big and open and airy so i feel<br>like there's a lot of room and i'm quite<br>comfortable<br>is a university that provides<br>a really safe and reliable place to<br>study<br>the wi-fi is great you've got food and<br>coffee available<br>on campus and you have a lot of<br>resources like student learning who you<br>can book in with<br>the library has resources that you're<br>always welcome to use<br>it's just very accessible in terms of my<br>grad school experience<br>the class sizes have been small enough<br>where the professors get to know me<br>day one basically and i have several<br>classes where the professors will make<br>it a point to<br>shift the desks and change them around<br>and we're looking each other and we're<br>dialoguing with each other and bouncing<br>ideas<br>back and forth yeah there's some lecture<br>but there's also a lot of great<br>interaction<br>and the professors have treated me and<br>the students<br>in the class as peers a lot of time hey<br>i want to hear your thoughts on that i<br>want to hear your opinion<br>i really loved wellington because it's a<br>very inclusive community<br>it has a lot of events going on it's<br>very lively but it's not<br>too chaotic and it's also surrounded by<br>nature<br>so it's great because whenever the city<br>does become a little too much<br>you're able to pop away into the forest<br>especially like<br>in seattle it's a like a huge metropolis<br>compared to wellington it's a lot<br>smaller but it still has like a<br>city feel you know but it's not huge and<br>i i like it a lot better here i<br>quite like going to the harbor or<br>the port yeah very beautiful views<br>of like some island and the water it's a<br>great place to walk and chat with people<br>and wellington is sort of known for its<br>food as well as cafes<br>if i could give my younger self advice i<br>would tell her<br>to not be so afraid of taking a chance<br>moving across the globe<br>is not as difficult as it feels it's not<br>as<br>challenging as it seems and you're also<br>not<br>as far away as you think you are moving<br>to a different country<br>is a scary thought and the idea of being<br>you know 8 000 miles away from everyone<br>you know<br>is not the first thing i would jump at<br>but you are<br>experiencing one of the coolest moments<br>in your life right now you have to stop<br>and remember that<br>if you have like a desire to explore<br>definitely think about leaving the<br>country<br>and coming to new zealand i'd definitely<br>say just<br>take risks i show up to uh international<br>students orientation<br>i i was like oh my gosh this is this is<br>like freshman year all over again but as<br>soon as i sat down<br>looked to my left looked my right made<br>friends and that afternoon i had sushi<br>for the first time<br>i started a group chat with these people<br>and ended up going to rugby games with<br>them<br>and so within literally an hour of being<br>there i went from being this is going to<br>be crazy too i have friends in<br>wellington<br>and was already feeling so comfortable<br>by taking that risk i made friends<br>i tried new foods i experienced a new<br>city that i fallen in love with just<br>so many different things have happened<br>because i stepped outside of my comfort<br>zone<br>and moved across the world for my<br>master's degree<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
