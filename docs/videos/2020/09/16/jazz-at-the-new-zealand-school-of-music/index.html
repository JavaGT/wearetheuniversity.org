Prepare yourself for a career as a performer or composer, or study jazz because you have a passion for it.<br><br>Discover the jazz programme at the New Zealand School of Music—Te Kōkī, at Victoria University of Wellington: www.wgtn.ac.nz/nzsm</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>So I chose to study jazz because I was<br>inspired by the improvisational side of things.<br>It's a really creative aspect of<br>music that I was really looking for to study.<br>So it's really great because of the tutors here like Colin Hemingson and Rodger Fox and really great tutors<br>and also a lot of opportunities that have arisen from studying here.<br>So playing the Rodger Fox big band now, his professional band, which has been really awesome furthering my career.<br>All the tutors have a got a sort of professional background.<br>We've all sort of played in touring bands and that really exposes the students to that professional side of life.<br>What's great about jazz for me is the inherent spontaneity when you're creating with your colleagues and the lack of hype.<br>But for me, Wellington, the community is a bit more my vibe so that was an easy choice.<br>I just love the creative side of the city, it's been really amazing to be here for the Jazz Festival and everything like that.<br>Something in the NZSM has given me the opportunity to perform at large venues.<br>Venues that I would not otherwise be able to perform in.<br>Put on creative things that also you would not normally put on, so not what's viable but what's creative,<br>and also network so you can start working professionally,<br>and all those things that do bigger and bigger concerts that otherwise you couldn't do on your own.<br>Stylist jazz but we try and keep it more contemporary so it's more relevant to the students,<br>and to the style of music they're going to play when they leave the school.<br>So that's what we have things like the Latin Ensemble, the fusion ensemble,  the guitar ensemble and<br>that really ties it into what they do when they leave the school and on a commercial professional basis.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
