so<br>it's a good feeling<br>it's great to be close with uh with you<br>here and it's fantastic to welcome you<br>to this this event<br>uh my name is stephen cummings i'm<br>professor of strategy and innovation<br>here at tiharangawaka victoria<br>university<br>of wellington and also uh with uh<br>my colleague dr jesse parini who's there<br>on the end of the<br>uh of our panel we look after<br>uh the atom tika ortiz innovation space<br>which is our<br>hub for innovation and entrepreneurship<br>here at tiharangawaka<br>um it's great to be here with the<br>fantastic panel we're very<br>special guest uh brad olson um<br>someone who i'm sure you've seen a lot<br>of recently and<br>uh if your reaction to seeing brad on<br>the telly<br>and on social media is anything like<br>mine your first reaction is probably<br>how old is he is that is he really<br>is that and i think um for us<br>it's it's a double whammy because we do<br>look and we see brad and we think<br>wasn't he in our class was he in classes<br>just a couple of years ago<br>um brad's rise has been meteoric it's<br>not such a surprise to us because i<br>think even when he was here<br>as a student we knew that brad was<br>destined for great things<br>and it's fantastic to have him here with<br>us to talk about how do we<br>innovate our way out of a covert or post<br>covert world<br>now it's a great shame that we are not<br>able to be joined by<br>napo riley from figure nz<br>just in the last 24 hours an opera fell<br>ill<br>we understand that she's she's doing<br>well but she sends her best wishes<br>her regards but we are um really lucky<br>that we have dr jesse pironi<br>and jesse has been doing some really<br>interesting work in terms of economic<br>strategies here<br>in whanganui atara the wellington region<br>with the greater wellington regional<br>council so he's got so many interesting<br>insights in terms of<br>what recovery means for the maori<br>economy particularly in this region<br>so we're really lucky to be here<br>together to have such a great panel<br>just a couple of housekeeping things<br>before we get started<br>this is wellington so we have to tell<br>you about what happens in the event<br>of an earthquake just drop cover and<br>hold if you feel an earthquake<br>wait to it till it passes maria or<br>caroline<br>jesse or myself we will guide you out<br>the front door our gathering point is<br>just here conveniently located<br>on bunny street if uh you need the<br>bathrooms they're<br>out of the door to the to the uh to the<br>right here towards the end of the<br>building<br>uh men's and women's and gender neutral<br>toilets towards the end of the building<br>there<br>um and i think that's all we need to say<br>except for the very important fact is<br>it's like if you've been to one of these<br>breakfasts before you may have noticed a<br>slight change<br>and that is that the food arrives after<br>the talking<br>so don't panic there is catering on the<br>way<br>if you thought well it's okay because<br>i'll get a danish at that thing that i'm<br>going to<br>you will it's just that you have to<br>listen to us<br>listen to us first so do not it's a<br>pretty good bribe it is<br>and it's also an incentive for us to uh<br>to to<br>to to get through our points quickly and<br>concisely<br>um i'll get the ball rolling i'll ask<br>these guys some some questions but<br>there'll also be time for<br>for your questions so when we get to the<br>end or if there's a burning issue that<br>happens part way through<br>just uh just put up your hand and ask<br>your question and<br>really this is an informal uh gathering<br>to hear from these experts<br>on how do we innovate our way out<br>so that's the topic today okay<br>thank you for that and what i really<br>wanted to start with<br>is uh to talk to brad<br>about the unique perspective that he has<br>traveling around artero seeing<br>what he's seen over the last six months<br>it's really interesting to me and i'm<br>sure interesting to you as well<br>um to to ask brad you know what does he<br>see as he travels around the country<br>what are some of the really encouraging<br>signs in terms of innovation<br>and then maybe what are some of the<br>barriers that might stop us as we move<br>forward<br>so brad it's it's interesting to see<br>where new zealand is<br>positioned and i guess there's a couple<br>key drivers of what we're seeing out<br>there in terms of<br>what's driving uh the economy generally<br>but also what's driving those regional<br>economies<br>so the last six months has taken me in<br>person to the likes of um all the way<br>from whangarei up north to<br>queenstown uh down in otago and<br>everywhere in between<br>and zoom meetings galore as i'm sure<br>everyone's been doing<br>what's interesting is seeing that<br>there's a lot of pain out there<br>you know businesses are doing it tough<br>people are doing it tough<br>but the key drivers of that are quite<br>different so if you look at somewhere<br>like queenstown<br>tourism uh you know 60 of their economy<br>there's a lot of focus there<br>uh in one specific industry which<br>doesn't have as many people coming<br>through<br>so those sort of areas are doing it<br>tough but also trying to figure out well<br>what do you do as an economy when you<br>don't have tourists and when<br>it's probably not likely that tourists<br>are going to come back just like that<br>the other end of the spectrum you go up<br>to somewhere like kaipera<br>the the place of the kumara you know<br>it's a completely different area you're<br>looking at<br>agriculture you're looking at those sort<br>of elements they're doing a lot better<br>they<br>haven't really noticed as much of a<br>difference they don't have quite as many<br>uh aucklanders coming up to mangafi but<br>that's sort of a separate issue they<br>quite enjoy that actually um<br>i'm sure the aucklanders would rather be<br>up and up at the beach but<br>so you've you've got those sort of<br>challenges in other areas you've got<br>construction which is quite a key driver<br>of their economy uh<br>you know fungiday is one good example<br>where that sort of stuff is<br>is uh proceeding all right at the minute<br>but you talk to builders and they're<br>saying i'm all right for the next nine<br>months but after that i don't really<br>know if there's any activity<br>um so there's a lot of different<br>compartments there that i think where<br>we're yet to see<br>how they are playing out what is<br>interesting though is that<br>when this crisis happened i'm sure you<br>know everyone in this room will have<br>done something similar<br>that that wash of what is next you know<br>that complete uncertainty that came<br>through was quite clear<br>um what was good to see across almost<br>every region i talked to was that they<br>immediately said look we've got to come<br>together we've got to put you know our<br>competition aside<br>uh whether we're a chamber of commerce a<br>council or a business or whoever<br>there was this real strong sort of<br>community sense that by local came<br>through very clearly<br>all of those elements were quite a<br>really strong<br>part of that cohesion you saw at a<br>regional level and so that's been quite<br>instructive<br>what i do um always say to a wellington<br>audience like this and i expect i mean<br>who here is actually from wellington<br>sort of born and bred<br>or who's more like me from whangarei and<br>move down<br>a few okay so if quite a few of you have<br>still<br>i expect to talk to mum and dad or or<br>family or friends out in other parts of<br>the country and so hopefully you'll<br>have gotten a better perspective the<br>thing i'm always worried about in<br>wellington is that we do have the public<br>sector and that's generally a pretty<br>safe job market<br>walking down lambton key talking to some<br>key decision makers they think<br>everything's fine<br>and it's not fine and i do want to sort<br>of press that point that things are not<br>all right yet<br>they are on a better path though so<br>that's that's the more encouraging sign<br>from a regional perspective<br>that's great i mean it's interesting you<br>talk about that um<br>the community spirit and and people<br>putting competition to one side<br>um and obviously we've all heard about<br>the team of five million<br>do you think that's gonna continue post<br>covert that that community spirit<br>i'd look i'd like to think so uh what we<br>did<br>quite quickly seen actually this was<br>advice to many people we talked about<br>throughout lockdown is that<br>in a crisis you know with such<br>uncertainty<br>uh the need for change is is is quite<br>persistent you you sort of survive or<br>die is how many people sort of look at<br>it<br>and so talking to people across the<br>regions what was quite clear is that<br>uh sometimes it wasn't a comprehensive<br>strategy of<br>you know you'd have so many different<br>organizations doing so many different<br>things that you<br>you could be killing one bird with about<br>20 stones um instead of one bird with or<br>two birds with the same stone<br>so what we saw quite quickly was that<br>people said look what can i bring to the<br>table and lay down and and therefore<br>what can i also pick up and so it was a<br>bit of one of those community boxes<br>i think moving forward there's more<br>collaboration because people recognize<br>that actually it works quite well<br>you know if you can get the entire<br>region on board if you can share some<br>good resources if you<br>make sure you're talking to ministers or<br>local decision makers and getting some<br>cash in hand for your region that's<br>actually quite advantageous<br>and there's also there's an element of<br>having to breed or walk a very fine line<br>in terms of regional storytelling<br>on one hand you want to be upbeat to<br>your local community because you want<br>people to spend you want people to<br>feel like things are going all right at<br>the same time you want wellington and<br>decision makers to think things are<br>going awful<br>because you need more cash to get things<br>going um and and<br>there's a little bit of cynicism in<br>there but i think what we have seen is<br>that people have said look not only do<br>we want cash for you know<br>investing in our sort of organizations<br>we also want it to be slightly more<br>enduring we don't just want it to be a<br>flash in the pan<br>we help through the next six months and<br>then it's all done we're seeing people<br>that are going<br>look we've wanted to do this project for<br>10 years this is the time that it will<br>really make a step change now economy so<br>i think that's been quite nice to see<br>that transition of<br>this is going to work not only for us<br>now but for us into the future yeah i<br>think that's really interesting<br>um and i'm interested now to ask jesse<br>as you've kind of been traveling around<br>this region<br>thinking about developing strategies<br>with particular emphasis on on the maori<br>economy with uh<br>te matarao amawi that project<br>what what sort of surprised you or what<br>sort of interested you<br>in terms of possibility for innovation<br>now<br>and post covered um<br>two things have kind of come up for me<br>recently so as part of the strategy<br>development we went around<br>the wider greater wellington region and<br>um the first thing that came out for me<br>was so i was born in wellington grew up<br>in wellington<br>is the diversity of the region so if you<br>go out to featherston to the wairarapa<br>it's a really different economy and you<br>know we<br>for me living here in central wellington<br>i didn't really see that<br>um along kapiti coast very different<br>with transmission gully coming in so<br>there's a lot of things changing<br>and there's actually a lot of diversity<br>in this economy<br>um but two things struck me so the first<br>thing was the second we went into<br>lockdown um<br>and i realized that i wasn't<br>particularly resilient<br>um i think i was alright mentally<br>resilient but<br>financially resilient you know after a<br>few weeks of not<br>earning a salary i would be in quite a<br>lot of trouble<br>and um i think<br>you know reflecting on that we live in a<br>time of like relative<br>comparative wealth and yet if we stop<br>doing what we're doing<br>suddenly it's all it's all over and i<br>think in terms of an innovation<br>uh to innovate our way out we need to<br>become a more<br>resilient economy that doesn't have to<br>rely on um<br>you know it'd be nice to not have to<br>constantly earn money<br>right to kind of get off this sort of<br>hamster wheel so<br>going around the communities um this<br>idea of<br>the link to resilience that i saw in the<br>communities is that when we talked about<br>economic development<br>people were saying you know it's not<br>actually just about money for us<br>for us money is it's a means to an end<br>and the communities we talked to were<br>saying<br>when i start a business when i think<br>about economic development there's all<br>sorts of other things that i want to<br>come out of that<br>business and we start we're starting to<br>see it with the well-being economy<br>across the across the whole of<br>government<br>but some of the things people were<br>talking about in terms of value that<br>they get from a business<br>one of the really interesting ones was<br>uh political<br>value so the ability to have a voice<br>so economic development to some of these<br>groups meant that they were able to have<br>a voice to make more decisions within<br>their<br>uh local community and um<br>so resilience through<br>companies that can produce multiple<br>types of value<br>and on the way in this morning i started<br>thinking of this idea of<br>instead of too big to fail um too useful<br>to fail<br>so can we make companies that are<br>delivering multiple streams of value<br>um i think that is potentially a really<br>useful innovation<br>and something that i was seeing in the<br>communities people were asking for that<br>kind of thing<br>can i just pick up on on something you<br>mentioned there jesse in terms of the<br>composition i think that's<br>probably an important story probably for<br>this group as well to recognize<br>that what that is one of the innovations<br>that sort of it's not something we're<br>going to consciously do it's we've<br>already done it because of lockdown that<br>is you know this working from home<br>element<br>um if you look at where people are<br>concentrated and where people work but<br>also where people spend<br>wellington city's been hit really hard<br>there you know activity<br>and and the city itself is pretty low<br>most days because more people are<br>working from home<br>but you go out to potido or the hut<br>carpety or over to the wider upper their<br>spending numbers are<br>in a very strong position and i think<br>that that's shown that people are<br>you know it goes back to not only too<br>useful to fail but also what people want<br>out of life<br>um and that's not always a nine to five<br>in an office that's saying well<br>actually look i do want to spend more<br>time with the kids i do want to go out<br>running i do want to you know play my<br>drums or whatever it is<br>and people are saying well actually i<br>can do both now a bit more<br>um now it's not suited everyone i i<br>struggled my way through lockdown in<br>front of my ironing board<br>which wasn't particularly good i don't<br>know how everyone else's setups went but<br>that's something i think we're going to<br>see more of as well as this remote<br>working and the potential for commuting<br>says to people particularly you know<br>younger people who<br>generally speaking are a bit more tech<br>savvy that you can choose a little bit<br>more where you want to live and what<br>that lifestyle looks like so it's not<br>just work work work get<br>65 retire move on like the the life<br>phasing has changed in a sense<br>i think it leads really nicely into this<br>this idea you know we're talking here<br>about how do we innovate our way out<br>um but it's a really interesting<br>question about what what is the out<br>that we want to get to you know there's<br>been a lot of talk in the uk<br>and the us and i think here as well<br>about building back<br>better so not just getting back to where<br>we were but actually seeing this as an<br>opportunity to do things a little bit<br>differently and one of the things i<br>really like about<br>brad's analysis and the work that jesse<br>does is<br>it's we you guys don't just look at gdp<br>and i think that's a really interesting<br>kind of development<br>and it's kind of i suppose a meta<br>innovation it's not inventing a better<br>light bulb or a mouse trap<br>it's actually thinking about what what<br>we're innovating for<br>so i'm really interested and maybe we'll<br>start with with you brad<br>to ask what what does better<br>look like in terms of of from an<br>economist point of view<br>what are we measuring and how will we<br>measure and how might that change our<br>lives going forward<br>i think one of the key ones is jobs and<br>that's<br>for two reasons one it makes sense you<br>have a job that does<br>create opportunity especially if you<br>don't just do a job<br>but wider than that it's also something<br>we can count now if i asked you how much<br>gdp<br>there might be in your company or<br>anywhere else who knows i mean<br>economists revise that stuff all the<br>time<br>if i ask you how many people work at<br>your firm you can count that<br>and for everyone in this room you know<br>what a job looks like so<br>it's measurable it's tangible for people<br>it makes sense and it's useful and<br>that's always a metric we look at<br>certainly when we look at building back<br>better there's an element of resilience<br>within different groups that we need to<br>focus on<br>this downturn we know has hit<br>particularly maori we saw that during<br>the global financial<br>crisis that while non-maori employment<br>fell two percent<br>maori employment fell something like 6.3<br>you know much wider effect<br>we're seeing it particularly full on<br>young people uh that you know if you're<br>under 30<br>you've lost jobs that so i think it's<br>double the rate of of those who are over<br>30.<br>we know that women particularly have<br>also seen their job losses come through<br>and all of those say that actually we've<br>got a problem here that there are some<br>groups that are concentrated in certain<br>types of work<br>that we either don't value properly or<br>don't value to the degree we should<br>uh and we need to be able to move people<br>up<br>you know instead of just keeping people<br>at a certain level of employment so<br>jobs is one area that i think we<br>certainly need to do a bit more work on<br>and to measure more now we've seen<br>skills development and such<br>uh which is always good i think what we<br>probably need to have is a bit more of a<br>national conversation about<br>if we've previously used migration to<br>bring in skilled workers and and<br>you know any economist will tell you<br>that that should be a short-term fix<br>new zealand's short-term fixes existed<br>for 30-plus years because every time we<br>identify that we need someone to<br>drive i don't know a combined harvester<br>or something we go yeah we'll<br>we'll train someone up in a few years<br>time and then we just keep pushing that<br>out<br>so we do need to get smarter on those uh<br>elements and having people go into the<br>areas that they can<br>start to to make money that's sort of<br>the core area for me is<br>is that jobs focus and and while the<br>skills focus because we do have a<br>changing economy we<br>are not going to have as much tourism<br>moving forward anyone that says that<br>tourism is going to snap back within<br>five years is kidding themselves<br>um that that is changing the way we're<br>doing things and more and more there's<br>not as much money to go around the<br>economy as well so you've got to get<br>smarter<br>from a business perspective you don't<br>have uh<br>that revenue coming in but your costs<br>are still relatively high so we are also<br>going to have to see digital innovation<br>you know the fact that some people still<br>don't do their accounts on xero or some<br>other platform<br>is sort of scary to me because<br>using a math book like you know i've<br>seen small businesses do in previous<br>times that's prone to error but more<br>importantly it's actually a real big<br>time issue<br>for businesses so changing the way of<br>thinking is going to be a really key way<br>that we do that that digital<br>uh sort of revolution is sort of very<br>much here<br>yeah i think that i mean so jobs i mean<br>that's it's so<br>simple and basic but it's really<br>interesting that we just don't talk so<br>much about<br>jobs and how real that is in our lives<br>um you know skills development i think<br>that's<br>you know crucial obviously you know<br>working in an educational institution<br>and i think also that the way that<br>perhaps you know when we saw that with<br>the covert app<br>new zealanders are reluctant to use the<br>technology that could help<br>them do the sort of analytics i think<br>which would be really useful even for a<br>small business<br>being able to track you know revenue<br>or track costs and then to be able to do<br>some analytic work i think would be you<br>know<br>fantastic and it was interesting though<br>i mean i don't know if you guys still<br>have<br>five six seven different apps on your<br>phone with all the different tracking<br>systems and what have you that we had in<br>the very early stages now<br>that was encouraging in one sense<br>because it said hey we've got a lot of<br>smart people who are doing a lot of<br>great work but<br>it also highlighted that often we've got<br>a lot of<br>cooks in the mix so we've got again<br>we're trying to kill one bird with<br>multiple stones and i think that's one<br>area that we<br>do also need to shift now we keep<br>talking about building back better<br>and everyone sort of says well is now<br>you know is what we've got now not good<br>enough and<br>no it's not we've got children in<br>poverty that can't have breakfast we've<br>got<br>well i was going to say we've got<br>housing issues we don't have housing<br>that is the issue<br>you know there are all those sort of<br>areas and again you sort of say okay we<br>don't have housing so people are<br>having bad health outcomes they're not<br>able to get to the right places they're<br>not able to live in the right spots<br>at the same time we say well look<br>construction is going to take a a big<br>hit<br>so you know why don't we allow for more<br>development because that will get<br>housing you know going that's a great<br>job earner construction is a hugely<br>labor intensive place<br>plus you get new houses i mean it's it's<br>a real win-win so<br>i think for all of these things we want<br>to build back better so that when we do<br>hit other crises that<br>we're in a better sort of net position<br>to allow people to move forward to have<br>those opportunities to have those<br>sort of choices around whether or not<br>they're working all the time or if<br>they're working and also enjoying life<br>at the same time so building back better<br>to me means we<br>do need to start to address some of our<br>sort of systemic issues we've always had<br>because in a crisis risk goes out the<br>window you know in previous times it was<br>too risky to<br>you know change development rules or do<br>other bits and pieces now<br>the risk that you do something and it<br>fails as well<br>you're already stuffed you know so so<br>that you may as well give something a<br>crack because if you fail then well<br>nothing's really happened that's right<br>you know it's it's half time and you're<br>down by 50 points so<br>um you know you've got a miracle well<br>yeah just got to pin your ears back and<br>no i think it's a serious point i think<br>you know we see through history in these<br>times of crisis<br>um that's where the sort of motivation<br>for innovation<br>can really um you know can really spark<br>jesse you talked about you know when<br>through uh ti matsura<br>omawi traveling around the communities<br>um<br>in diverse communities in this region<br>people were telling you look it's not<br>just about money it's not just about<br>economics or finance so what is it about<br>what what do people in those communities<br>want<br>to see valued more highly if<br>we do build back better um<br>for maori communities most of the time<br>it's about tinoranga<br>so being basically in control of your<br>own decisions your own life<br>um and in terms of building back better<br>i think there's two key things one is<br>better connections to community so<br>people being really situated where they<br>are<br>feeling like they belong there feeling<br>like this is their place um<br>and another thing is um<br>i don't know a good term for it but um<br>equity in innovation<br>so um someone asked me<br>are you talking about innovation here<br>what how are you defining innovation<br>um and in this case what i'm talking<br>about is<br>creating something new that produces<br>value which is pretty standard<br>definition of<br>innovation and<br>sometimes these new things that create<br>value create heaps of value<br>for a very small number of people and a<br>lot of people that are interested in<br>entrepreneurship have this<br>this view of the kind of soul<br>entrepreneur or the<br>small founding group that cash out and<br>become billionaires<br>and i'm currently working on a project<br>science for technological innovation<br>which is a government funded science<br>innovation project and a big part of<br>that is saying<br>how do we create innovation across<br>the whole country so this idea of equity<br>and innovation<br>because everyone deserves to have new<br>ideas and create value from them<br>and i guess you could argue that a lot<br>of new ideas are going to come from<br>places where<br>um well maybe there's a lot of latent<br>value let's say in places where<br>innovation isn't necessarily getting to<br>where people are kind of grinding day in<br>day out<br>they're not having maybe the opportunity<br>to<br>come up with or realize their new ideas<br>and find value from those ideas<br>whatever kind of value you might be<br>trying to find so<br>um yeah those are two things i think are<br>really important<br>yeah actually i can remember um actually<br>going<br>with you at one of those trips up to to<br>masterton and<br>there are some guest speakers from the<br>community and it's interesting going to<br>the regions because they're not<br>necessarily the stories that that we<br>hear here<br>you know we've already mentioned xero we<br>could mention trademe we could we you<br>know callahan innovation is across the<br>road investing in all sorts of amazing<br>technology but um you know in the<br>regions the stories are a bit different<br>you know um an amazing young woman who<br>started a hairdressing business<br>that is really bringing the community<br>together um<br>florist the like sustainable florist<br>she's picking stuff that's like local<br>when you import flowers they get<br>massively fumigated<br>and then we put them in our houses and<br>we put our faces in them<br>and so she's doing yeah you know a<br>florist and you don't really think of<br>that you think of<br>yeah trade me yeah and i remember it was<br>a guy uh<br>you know a sharing business running a<br>sharing game you know employing a<br>hundred people<br>all around the country and developing<br>some really innovative practices<br>but those aren't the stories that that<br>we hear and you know thinking about<br>if you like maybe gross domestic stories<br>if we could sort of grow<br>that set of what it means to be<br>innovative i think<br>you know it as jesse says it becomes<br>more equitable<br>because i think at the moment i'm not<br>sure that everyone can see a pathway to<br>be<br>innovative because they're thinking<br>innovation steve jobs<br>elon musk sam morgan um<br>they're not yeah i don't know whether he<br>had some comment on that and i think<br>we've got to move away from that because<br>look zero traded me all of those guys<br>absolutely great<br>but in new zealand 90 of our businesses<br>are small medium enterprises like<br>you know that we hear some of these<br>great success stories and that's<br>fantastic but there's a lot of other<br>operators out there that are<br>doing just as well that you you know<br>might not make it to<br>tv every night and you know for those<br>people on the ground as well that<br>you say well they might employ one<br>additional person if 90<br>90 of the businesses in new zealand<br>employed one additional person<br>you know we'd have to import labor like<br>nobody's business from overseas so<br>that the potential for those small<br>organizations to just make very<br>incremental changes<br>that have much wider benefits is huge<br>but i also think it goes to what you're<br>saying around what is innovation<br>um because i think too often when we<br>hear innovation we think r<br>d and and tax credits and similar and i<br>know<br>um nerdy for a second but we we deal<br>with data and stats all the time and i<br>remember looking at stats in zed's<br>research and development survey and i<br>still to this day<br>don't know exactly how a business<br>answers those surveys because i don't<br>know<br>from a business point of view what<br>research and development<br>is and what just doing your normal<br>course of businesses i mean if i'm going<br>to try and develop a new product<br>to get data out to our regional clients<br>for example<br>we probably don't call that r d we just<br>call that work you know and so i think<br>sometimes there's a there's a need to<br>get outside of<br>uh thinking about r d in a more academic<br>sense or sort of you know we've got to<br>do a lot of<br>five years worth of beta testing before<br>we launch something that actually you<br>know and again that comes back to the<br>risk profile when the risk profile is so<br>low when you can do things without too<br>much of consequences<br>then you do want to i think go a little<br>bit further and be a bit more<br>transformative because<br>again the the the upside the benefit<br>potential is huge and the downside risk<br>is<br>is pretty low yeah now before we started<br>brad i said i wasn't going to put you on<br>the spot but actually i changed my mind<br>about that because i think this this<br>discussion is led in a really<br>interesting<br>direction and we have a leading<br>economist here and we've talked about a<br>lot of different<br>value i suppose um in terms of what<br>people<br>want better to look like can we measure<br>that stuff<br>as an economist and see you know i<br>understand it's easier to<br>measure the financial things but can we<br>measure the other things that we've been<br>talking about<br>i think i mean the answer to that in a<br>roundabout way is we have to i mean<br>you can argue whether or not we can<br>argue measure something to the nth<br>degree but at the<br>end of the day if we want to measure<br>progress we have to understand what's<br>happening<br>um one of the phrases i've always sort<br>of said is that what gets measured gets<br>managed<br>because if you don't know about<br>something then you don't care about it<br>we all say for example in new zealand<br>that the environment's in a bad state<br>and that's absolutely true<br>but if you ask most people how they know<br>that it's very hard to get it going so<br>you say okay what is it is it that we<br>don't recycle enough is it because our<br>water quality is bad is it because we<br>have too much going into the ozone layer<br>all those different pizza pieces pizzas<br>hungry of course in the morning<br>um but if you if you say to people you<br>know how how is the economy going or<br>whatever you say oh well i know that<br>spending's doing this and employment's<br>doing that and gdp is doing this other<br>thing and<br>electricity generation is doing blah<br>blah so we have to be able to measure<br>things and<br>that was something as well that with a<br>little bit of effort you can do<br>i mean two years back i put together a a<br>table of recycling rates across new<br>zealand because again people are saying<br>well<br>we're not doing good in the rubbish<br>space it was like well that's cool but<br>if you can't give me any evidence<br>no one's going to believe you and so as<br>stupid as it is numbers are the currency<br>of<br>decision makers because if you can make<br>a good case then you can get things done<br>and so<br>in wellington city for example we<br>recycle something like 15<br>of our total waste volume it's among the<br>lowest in the country yet wellington<br>keeps talking about how great it is from<br>an environmental<br>perspective i think we've put in<br>something like 48<br>more per capita into the rubbish dump in<br>the last few years so again once you<br>start having those numbers a lot of<br>people go oh<br>that's an issue now i know that it's an<br>issue i can see it and i can start to do<br>some<br>stuff about it so yes you can measure it<br>you just need to<br>i guess have a bit of willpower to go<br>forward and sort of break down the door<br>a bit more<br>sure and that's innovation in<br>measurement right so it's good<br>it says here we're nearly i can see<br>those uh sort of savories and things<br>over there so i'm<br>trying to bring this all to a close it<br>says here<br>um there's an election soon do people<br>know that<br>okay i hope you're all enrolled so it<br>says here there's an election year well<br>there isn't an election<br>that we know seriously that there's an<br>election coming up so i want to<br>want to sort of i suppose conclude by<br>asking each of our panelists<br>um no matter who sort of ends up<br>being you know governing the country<br>post the election<br>if there's one piece of advice that you<br>could give to<br>the new government coming in uh with<br>regard to<br>innovation what would that piece of<br>advice be<br>do we start with you brad yeah i think<br>firstly it's got to be a partnership now<br>i don't<br>it doesn't matter who it's worth it has<br>to be a partnership whether it's with<br>ewe if it's with business if it's with<br>households it needs to be<br>something that the government does<br>together rather than sort of just forces<br>upon<br>and with that i do think that some sort<br>of digital advancement is has got a real<br>power to move<br>businesses and households ahead we saw<br>back in 2010 how well<br>uh ultra fast broadband did now i don't<br>i'd hate to imagine how new zealand<br>would look if we hadn't made that<br>investment<br>uh and we'd gone into lockdown i mean it<br>would have been abysmal<br>i still remember you know using dial-up<br>when i was at home uh and found<br>and that was you know that was the norm<br>until it wasn't so those sort of<br>advancements although you might not have<br>felt like they were very important<br>when push comes to shove that critical<br>so more more of that sort of work and i<br>think from a business point of view<br>trying to get uh money to businesses to<br>get over that initial<br>hurdle because it's expensive to move to<br>online systems it's expensive to<br>buy that sort of equipment so you<br>provide a little bit of help to get<br>people over that divide<br>and i think we're in a really good place<br>to move the country forward but i am<br>going to have a second bite of the<br>cherry<br>there and and that's because i do think<br>that fundamentally one of the issues we<br>have in this country<br>is around housing and i expect that this<br>group here is probably going to be<br>unanimous in support for something like<br>that<br>because wellington rents are really high<br>and don't seem to be going anywhere<br>anytime soon<br>and so that sort of work there does have<br>the potential to<br>produce some very long-term benefits it<br>does jobs it<br>provides better outcomes for people in<br>terms of health it provides better<br>outcomes for people in terms of their<br>earnings<br>and so i think actually providing some<br>real step change on our development<br>pipeline for the country<br>as well as that digital area are two<br>places that the government could get a<br>lot of mileage out of<br>and if we're looking that does good<br>things for jobs which is great because<br>jobs are measurable and every politician<br>likes to see job numbers<br>but also it provides that sort of more<br>wider well-being benefit for people<br>right thanks brad jesse um<br>something i think we've learned<br>throughout this whole covert process<br>is that we can pull together as a as a<br>team of five million<br>and and work towards something together<br>and i think the if the new government<br>can<br>beat down that realization that we can<br>work together and do<br>amazing things then um you know there's<br>a<br>it would be a terrible shame to lose<br>that sense across the country<br>now that we have it so yeah that's<br>interesting i was thinking as you were<br>talking there before<br>about innovation and the way that we we<br>have tended to teach it we've tended to<br>teach innovation as an individual sport<br>and i think what i'm hearing from from<br>you guys and your experiences is<br>that maybe innovation in new zealand for<br>the future should be more of a team<br>sport that we should you know the case<br>studies that we teach students shouldn't<br>just be richard branson<br>or steve jobs on their own doing amazing<br>things you know it should be<br>focused more on on you know diverse<br>teams working together<br>and there are always teams i mean i bet<br>that every one of you here from no<br>matter what area you are if you go back<br>to the office today<br>and no one else is there you can't do<br>your job you can do a fair bit of it<br>sure<br>a lot of you are going to be very<br>capable people but you just can't do it<br>all<br>i mean even myself if i go back to the<br>office today and if the chief forecaster<br>isn't there and if our economist team<br>isn't there then<br>i can only go so far and so i think that<br>we do need to recognize that there are<br>no iron men<br>in an economy or in a in a place there<br>has to be that sort of<br>work together and that's again why when<br>you look at regions one of the first<br>things that i talked to someone in the<br>manual too and they said look we've<br>pulled together the chamber of commerce<br>the local councils uh<br>and the local economic development<br>agency and they made i think was an<br>online storefront<br>because there are a whole lot of<br>businesses that wanted to sell at level<br>four and level three but<br>couldn't they were all you know physical<br>based and so you couldn't do that<br>and so they said well look we'll host an<br>online you know a shop front online and<br>you can sell your goods through that<br>that was very quick to do but again if<br>you hadn't had all those operators to do<br>it you wouldn't have got it<br>you didn't have the economic development<br>agency you wouldn't have had the<br>storefront<br>but if you don't have the businesses in<br>the storefronts there with no goods to<br>sell so it has to be<br>a joined up approach great thanks very<br>much we've got some time uh for<br>questions from the floor i'm sure people<br>have questions you're<br>very quick with your hand up ask away<br>yeah sure hey um<br>i just had a question about jobs so you<br>talked about everything<br>right but what are the methods that have<br>is yep there's a whole bunch and i won't<br>get too technical though happy to<br>talk a bit more detail afterwards what<br>we've seen through this crisis is also<br>very different from what we normally see<br>in an economy during a crisis normally<br>you see jobs cut just straight away<br>people go<br>now the wage subsidy stopped some of<br>that but what you've also seen is what<br>economists<br>thought we'd never really see which is<br>that sticky wages didn't hold so the<br>general thinking is that<br>wages only really go up because no one's<br>going to take a pay cut apart from when<br>there's a pandemic and everyone says i'd<br>rather take a 10 20<br>pay cut than lose my job so you've seen<br>pay cuts coming through so even though<br>job numbers might not have fallen all<br>that much we have seen earnings that<br>have gone down so<br>looking at earnings per worker is one<br>way to look at it we've seen the hours<br>have gone down quite a bit as well so<br>again someone still got a job but<br>they're now working 10 hours instead of<br>30 hours<br>again that means that there's less money<br>so you see that in the earnings number<br>but you also see that and the hours<br>worked<br>you're right as well in terms of where<br>people are working both in terms of<br>location and industry so we do have a<br>bit of a look at that<br>through various sources what it does<br>show is that those more provincial<br>areas of the economy particularly with a<br>primary or a food based economy are<br>doing particularly well there is<br>not only are there jobs there but<br>they're holding up anything with tourism<br>bases in a much tougher position<br>um and in terms of uh the the i guess<br>also<br>the regionality we're seeing that some<br>of our urban centers have had a bit of<br>life sucked out of them<br>and so i think ford in terms of when we<br>measure things going forward<br>that's a conversation that does have to<br>be had in new zealand because<br>the last 50 years there's been a move<br>towards urbanization a bit more<br>now you're sort of seeing a bit more of<br>a pullback and people saying<br>actually house prices are really high in<br>the in urban centres i'd actually like<br>to go out you know and live possibly<br>if i work in hamilton for example i<br>might live in waipa and telemutu<br>because i can get there pretty quickly<br>but i can get a cheaper house and i can<br>get a great lifestyle on a you know bit<br>of land that i can look after the kids<br>and ride my motorbike in the weekends<br>so people i think are looking for those<br>sort of shifts as well and so the<br>way of working the place of work and<br>also the type of work that people are<br>and particularly being someone who has<br>worked in the innovation sector<br>it's frustrating now working in the<br>public sector because there's a lot of<br>really<br>taking an enormous amount of democracy<br>how do we leverage this sort of teamwork<br>mentality<br>to diffuse silence and also<br>um i think that's a really tough<br>question<br>but i think it probably starts i think<br>it probably actually starts with you<br>like with people in this room who are<br>thinking you know i want to work a<br>little bit differently<br>and you just have to go into work and<br>try and find ways to do that and<br>yes there's heaps of red tape and<br>organizations are notoriously hard to<br>work with<br>we we complain about it here but to be<br>honest it took us three weeks<br>to put up this rules of the space we<br>probably sent<br>30 emails about that thing um<br>and you know we got sucked into it as<br>well<br>um but i think it does start with you<br>you know your question about like<br>metrics and like how do we<br>measure what is good about a job and um<br>a question<br>i think for everyone is what do you do<br>at work that's really good that's really<br>useful that's really valuable<br>and do you know what that is and if you<br>don't know what it is how can you find<br>it<br>so there's like there's a kind of<br>avalanche of information becoming<br>available to us now<br>so we can tell what you did on your<br>computer what you wrote who you<br>wrote stuff to um who you're spending<br>time with<br>where you are physically in the building<br>we can tell all of these things but we<br>still don't quite know what to do with<br>it and i think<br>you know we often think of metrics and<br>big data is this kind of overarching<br>analysis that comes from above<br>but actually we can do that analysis<br>also from the bottom up and we have a<br>better sense i think<br>of what we're doing at work from<br>ourselves<br>and so how can we make use of that data<br>so<br>um yeah it comes back to you<br>i think as well i mean make a good case<br>for change because again you know the<br>risks are low but more importantly<br>this is a crisis that is ch you know<br>it's completely shifted the foundations<br>which are still sort of shaking beneath<br>us<br>and i say that because if you look at um<br>the government's response say to cover<br>19 uh you know the<br>the instagram the facebook posts and all<br>that are really critical now with all<br>due respect to all of your senior<br>managers who you might talk to later in<br>the day<br>they're probably not as if with<br>instagram as you might like to have so<br>if you let them do their old way of<br>thinking which is to<br>you know and i'm being a little bit uh<br>antagonistic here<br>but putting stuff in newspapers for<br>example or putting things on the tv news<br>i haven't watched tv news and<br>well since i had a tv um so for a lot of<br>people you know the way of<br>operating is shifting so you sort of<br>have to meet people where they are<br>now i say that in terms of making a good<br>case because if you can prove to someone<br>that your idea<br>is going to get them further along<br>wherever their goal is they're not<br>completely on board with that i had a<br>friend who<br>and actually we did this at our firm<br>that first week of lockdown i said to<br>the boss i said i<br>can i buy a zoom account on my credit<br>card he was like what what's a zoom<br>and it was i i want a zoom account then<br>we can talk to clients it was oh<br>give it a crack within a week we'd talk<br>to i think it was something like 600<br>of our clients we've never done that<br>three years in total because you know<br>you go out for coffee and that's lovely<br>love talking to clients but if you don't<br>get in front of them if you don't change<br>with the times then<br>you know you will eventually not exist<br>the other thing i think and it comes<br>back to that also just having<br>sometimes more informal conversations so<br>wellington city council<br>recognized that you know the economy was<br>in a bad place and they had a leading<br>role<br>they brought together a bunch of<br>stakeholders that i don't even know what<br>our formal term is but we meet every<br>fortnight on zoom we've got people from<br>retail<br>uh from hospitality from the<br>professional services sector you know<br>accounting law<br>um they've got a random economist on<br>there but what they're doing there is<br>they're saying okay what issues are<br>happening that you that you can tell us<br>about before they hit the papers<br>so instead of being reactive it's<br>proactive and so i think making that<br>shift of if you can make a good case and<br>if you can address things ahead of time<br>then people are more likely to take on<br>those good ideas at the moment because<br>i think everyone recognizes that even if<br>they don't like the shift away from<br>siloed thinking that that's where it's<br>moving<br>and you either have to get on board or<br>you're going to be left behind<br>yeah and i mean that this is of course<br>part of my personal view so so<br>you know um take it with a grain of salt<br>i think what we are seeing<br>with the the cannabis debate is um<br>a lot of people who aren't possibly<br>quite as informed as we might need them<br>to be to vote<br>the number of people that i've had to<br>tell that this is not about a medicinal<br>cannabis referendum is concerning<br>um there is economic potential uh and in<br>terms of you would be able to<br>to tax that and and you you know you'd<br>start to get some money through it and<br>again the hope is that you move it from<br>an illegal substance to a legal<br>substance and then they therefore have<br>the regulation the right health care<br>settings around it<br>um i do think that there is still a big<br>social cost no matter what you do and<br>the hope is that<br>this change would move you further<br>towards being able to support people<br>um i'm personally still dubious of some<br>of the considerations around how much<br>money<br>uh you'll make because if there's one<br>thing we've learned is it's that<br>sometimes that illegal market doesn't<br>quite shift as quickly as you might<br>expect it to<br>um so yes there is economic potential um<br>and i guess the the conversation here is<br>does that potential outweigh the the<br>costs probably it does the question is<br>how well can we measure those some of<br>those social costs as well<br>it's my balanced view hey um i'm sure<br>people have a few more questions brad's<br>going to stick around for a little bit<br>longer jesse will be here we've got some<br>coffee and tea so<br>what i'd like to do is to ask if you'll<br>join me<br>in thanking our wonderful panelists brad<br>guys<br>as i say um stick around uh this this<br>space the aston tikahotiya<br>is where our student entrepreneurs work<br>student company student entrepreneurs<br>are based here um they don't tend to get<br>up that early though<br>um so the space stick around in the<br>space um<br>have a coffee uh grab snack and and talk<br>to one another talk<br>to our panelists and if you're<br>interested in what we're doing here<br>at tiharangawaka in terms of innovation<br>and entrepreneurship<br>just uh just look up the atom victoria<br>university and you'll see<br>you know stories of some of the<br>entrepreneurs and other things that<br>we've got<br>happening here it's been a great<br>pleasure to welcome you all hopefully<br>i'll get around and talk to people as<br>well<br>so do stick around it's been fabulous<br>having brad i know he's got a busy day<br>but he's going to be here for a little<br>bit longer yeah<br>so come and have a chat to brad get a<br>coffee um stick around for a few minutes<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
