are going to cover<br>off the two<br>at the subjects that i've mentioned<br>today and we do encourage you to<br>send us some questions so flick through<br>there should be a q a<br>we will get to questions live on air um<br>if we have enough time but please send<br>them through while i'm having a chat<br>and the ladies in the background will be<br>able to answer those or we'll have more<br>of a discussion<br>as we go throughout the programs<br>but i thought i would introduce first<br>the university i do<br>i know we have quite a few international<br>students joining us on this webinar this<br>evening so thank you so much for being<br>here<br>and so i like i said introduce<br>universities so we are tehrangawaka<br>victoria university of wellington<br>uh there's some stats there about the<br>university so we are<br>a medium-sized university here in new<br>zealand we've got about<br>22 000 students and that's spread across<br>all of our programs subjects<br>and and degrees and postgraduate<br>programs<br>we are based in wellington which is the<br>capital city and down the bottom there<br>on my screen you should see a beautiful<br>picture of wellington<br>on a lovely sunny day um and in that<br>image there it shows you our different<br>campuses<br>so we are spread across the well the<br>capital city and we're based at the<br>pipeteer campus for the business school<br>and i will talk about that in a little<br>bit<br>more detail as we go on<br>here's a nice snapshot of wellington<br>though so if you aren't familiar um<br>so wellington's capital city of new<br>zealand and we've got 500 000 people on<br>average who live here<br>there again you should see a beautiful<br>image of wellington on your screen<br>so the university and its three campuses<br>are dotted around the capital city<br>and the business school itself so the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>it's right in the heart of the business<br>district and i'm going to show you some<br>pictures of where we're located as we go<br>throughout<br>wellington though is a really really<br>vibrant city it's a<br>student city as well it's full of life<br>with our students and<br>there's a lot of entrepreneurship lots<br>of cafes a really good uh<br>cultural scene so do visit us if you are<br>in new zealand<br>but i want to talk a little bit more<br>about who we are<br>and who the what the programs are that<br>i'm going to be mentioning today<br>so we are the wellington school of<br>business and government<br>so we are a faculty part of the wider<br>university<br>and like i mentioned we are located<br>right in that business district<br>i'm not sure if you can see the picture<br>because it's quite small and but i'll<br>show you a close-up further on but we do<br>have<br>parliament if you can see my mouse and<br>just behind it is is the business school<br>so we're right there in the middle of<br>everything that's going on with all the<br>courts the ministries<br>um and all that government and and<br>entrepreneurship like i said<br>you'll also see that we have uh down the<br>bottom there's<br>uh some accreditations so the<br>accreditations listed are our triple<br>crown accreditation<br>and that's an accreditation that<br>business schools around the world strive<br>to get<br>and we're very lucky we do have our<br>programs accredited but by this triple<br>crown<br>so you can know that your qualification<br>is well known<br>and so if you are applying for jobs in<br>new zealand or overseas that people<br>understand what a business program at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>is<br>we are um there's a little bit more of a<br>close-up on my screen there so<br>if again if you're familiar with<br>wellington you should notice the beehive<br>that's our political center that's our<br>government building<br>and parliament is the square building<br>just to the side of that<br>across the road there is our law school<br>so that's a white building with a red<br>roof<br>and just to the side the tall office<br>looking building that is the business<br>school itself<br>so we really are right in the middle of<br>everything that is going on<br>and we really draw on that for our<br>programs so we<br>get a lot of guest lectures to come in<br>and speak to our students<br>but we also have a lot of hands-on and<br>applied learning and encourage our<br>students to have internships or<br>consultancy projects and really get<br>immersed in the business community<br>the business and government community<br>that they are studying in<br>here's a wee snapshot of what's inside<br>our campus so that that lovely tall<br>office building you could see<br>here's an image of our library so it is<br>a really modern campus<br>it's dedicated just for our business<br>students down here<br>and like i mentioned across the road as<br>our law school so<br>what everything you'll need for your<br>studies will you'll find in this<br>building here which is called rutherford<br>house<br>so the top image there is of our library<br>uh the bus<br>the so the building itself has just<br>undergone a massive renovation<br>and the bottom image on my screen that's<br>our dedicated studio<br>sorry dedicated student study space<br>so when we mention the professional<br>programs and i will explain a little bit<br>more about what that means but<br>we talk about a group of students and a<br>group of uh<br>qualifications that that work towards or<br>help people with their professional<br>career<br>all of us programs that we look after<br>our students can access the study space<br>so it's just for our professional<br>program students and that helps you with<br>the networking between<br>those students that you're studying<br>alongside but also<br>other professional students in all of<br>our programs which ranges<br>it's quite a large list here it's about<br>10 different programs to help you no<br>matter what stage of your career that<br>so we will deep dive now more into the<br>professional programs like i said and<br>the two in particular that we're going<br>to be talking through today<br>but before i delve into the the two<br>programs that we're going to be<br>mentioning this evening<br>i want to talk a little bit about the<br>similarities between our programs before<br>we go in to talk about the individual<br>um the individualness of each of them so<br>like i mentioned the professional<br>programs is a suite of<br>of ten and and how we best describe them<br>to people<br>is no matter what career stage you're in<br>at your in your journey<br>we have a program that will suit you so<br>we tend to divide those programs into<br>three different areas<br>the first area is for students who are<br>wanting to kick-start their career<br>so these are typically recent graduates<br>or graduates who don't have a huge<br>amount of work experience<br>or don't have a huge amount of work<br>experience in the particular area that<br>they're wishing to study<br>so both of the programs i'm going to<br>talk to tonight they fall into that<br>category<br>and you don't have to have a business or<br>accounting background to study either of<br>these programs<br>the next category we have is a category<br>for people who are wanting to change<br>or transition within their careers so<br>you may have a couple of years of<br>work experience but you're looking for<br>that next step<br>again these programs fall quite nicely<br>into that gap because you can have a<br>wealth of work experience<br>in a different area but you're looking<br>at transitioning or moving into the<br>business side<br>or the accounting background we have<br>other programs again that fall under<br>a government and and other things like<br>that so if you are thinking about<br>transitioning and you're not too sure<br>these programs don't feel right for you<br>tonight then we do have some other<br>programs you can look at<br>and then finally we have programs for<br>students who are looking at upskilling<br>or enhancing<br>so these are programs that are going to<br>use the knowledge that you have<br>whether it's academic or whether that's<br>work experience and help you build on<br>those to help you excel<br>in in your career the programs have all<br>been designed though<br>with that career focus in mind so<br>embedded into the program<br>alongside the academic content you're<br>going to learn there's a lot of<br>professional development<br>and that means in many so means a<br>different range of things<br>so embedded into our programs we have a<br>lot of networking<br>so this is networking that you might do<br>with your in your peers in your program<br>like i mentioned before we have<br>networking though with everybody who's<br>studying these programs in that<br>professional<br>uh program student study space we<br>regularly hold networking events again<br>that spans the whole<br>professional program network and then<br>there's also specifically for some<br>programs there's<br>industry specific networking events that<br>we host<br>there's webinars you can attend there's<br>in-person events so it's really there to<br>help you expand your<br>career network there's the people who<br>teach you as well<br>are really great connectors so they can<br>help you with that networking<br>but they're also a wealth of knowledge<br>so our academics<br>are uh they've got an intellectual<br>firepower they're really amazing in<br>their field so i encourage you to look<br>at who will be teaching you in these<br>programs<br>get to know their research get to know<br>their speciality and because you<br>get these really nice small class sizes<br>and you get to connect really well with<br>these<br>industry experts and they have a lot of<br>connections out there in the field as<br>well<br>so that's some of the similarities i<br>will talk about some more similarities<br>as i explain these programs<br>but i know that you're all here this<br>evening to learn specifically about<br>these two masters programs we have on<br>offer<br>so i will kick into those so the first<br>one we're going to be talking about is<br>the first one on our screen there which<br>is the master of professional accounting<br>or you might see it written down as the<br>mpa so a lot of our courses they have<br>these short codes so if you are wanting<br>to find out more information on the<br>website<br>the short codes are a nice way to to<br>find the program quite easily<br>so our master professional accounting<br>like i mentioned<br>is for anybody so if you have a<br>bachelor's degree<br>it doesn't have to be in accounting you<br>can look at taking this program<br>so our program is one of only two<br>universities in new zealand which have<br>this aacsb<br>accreditation and worldwide there's only<br>one percent of business schools with<br>this accreditation so it's a really high<br>uh and well valued qualification<br>now the duration here we often get asked<br>about how long it takes<br>for students to study and it takes 16<br>or 19 months depending on what pathway<br>you choose<br>and we will explain a little bit more<br>about those pathways<br>you'll also see we list trimesters so we<br>talk about trimesters here at the<br>university<br>other universities sometimes call this a<br>semester or a term<br>it's really our teaching period<br>throughout the year<br>so across the year we have three which<br>is why we call them trimesters<br>so trimester one runs from february to<br>june<br>trimester two is july till october and<br>then our summer period we call that<br>trimester three which is november<br>to february both programs i'm talking<br>about tonight<br>have a trimester 3 intake which means<br>you can start studying in november for<br>these programs<br>so that's what we mean there when we say<br>it could take four or five trimesters<br>we're talking about those periods but<br>sometimes it's easier to think about it<br>in how many months it's going to take<br>you to complete<br>now the delivery of these programs<br>they're<br>here to fit around people working so you<br>can take classes either midday<br>or you can do evening classes like i<br>mentioned this is best suited for a<br>graduate from any<br>discipline so it is really open what<br>your career goals might be<br>this program if you're interested in<br>accounting and building up those skills<br>then this is a good program for you<br>now the pathway as i mentioned before we<br>do have two different pathways<br>and that's the difference in in the<br>study duration and that depends if you<br>want to do a traditional masters<br>of professional accounting or if you're<br>looking at this new chartered<br>accountants pathway and that's what<br>rebecca is going to be talking about in<br>a little bit more detail as we go<br>throughout<br>so to be accepted into this program you<br>do need to have a bachelor's degree<br>like i've said though it can be in any<br>discipline you do not need to have a<br>background in accounting or business<br>the way the program has been set up it<br>assumes students don't have a background<br>in that<br>so if you are feeling nervous please<br>don't worry too much our academics are<br>there to support you<br>and make sure that you get all the<br>content that you need to know<br>you also need to be approved by the<br>program director so that is a person<br>called christopher cripps<br>and if you do want to talk to him let us<br>know and we can connect you<br>and if you are an international student<br>looking to study with us<br>you will need to provide proof of<br>english proficiency and fiona whose will<br>be talking to you shortly she will<br>explain what that means and<br>where you can find the information about<br>it<br>but the two pathways like i mentioned so<br>we have the traditional mpa pathway and<br>the chartered accountants one<br>and i'm going to talk you through the<br>the similarities but also the<br>differences here<br>so you should see the traditional<br>pathway on the screen right now<br>and it mentions it's 16 courses it is a<br>240 point<br>masters program and it takes four<br>trimesters or 16 months to complete<br>by taking this qualification you will<br>meet the cannes<br>academic accreditation requirement so<br>you will meet the requirements for all<br>the academic courses that you need to be<br>taking<br>now this chartered accountants pathway<br>which is the different the other one<br>that we're talking about this evening<br>it's you take more courses here so you<br>take 12 of the core courses<br>the in the same ones as the traditional<br>pathway but then you take a<br>a different set of five cans module<br>courses<br>and again rebecca will explain in more<br>detail about what they are<br>the program is also 240 points so it's<br>the same amount of points as<br>as the traditional pathway and what that<br>means to you is it doesn't actually cost<br>you<br>any more to do this chartered<br>accountants pathway compared with the<br>traditional<br>mpa pathway it will take you a little<br>bit longer though it is five trimesters<br>worth of study or 19 months<br>but with this chartered accountants<br>pathway you do meet the cannes academic<br>but also the technical requirements<br>that you you need to become a chartered<br>accountant<br>so so think some key points to note here<br>like i said it's the same cost for both<br>pathways<br>it's the same amount of points the uh<br>chartered accountant pathway does cost a<br>little bit more<br>as i not cost more so it takes a little<br>bit longer but it doesn't cost you any<br>more<br>we're also really proud that this<br>pathway is exclusive to victoria<br>university of wellington in new zealand<br>for the next wee while and our students<br>who are doing this pathway<br>it's a really good way to get ahead in<br>so we do like uh just building sorry on<br>what i mentioned before<br>we are the only accounting program in<br>new zealand to to meet both the academic<br>and the technical requirements for<br>cairns<br>and that's a reason a lot of our<br>students do choose to study with us<br>so we've got alzheimer here she's an mpa<br>student<br>and i was speaking to her the other day<br>and she said through her research that<br>was one of the big things that really<br>appealed to her<br>she could come and complete her masters<br>with her and then tick off<br>not just the academic requirements but<br>the technical requirements as well<br>but i'm not an expert in the chartered<br>accountancy area so i<br>am going to invite rebecca to talk to<br>you a little bit more about what that<br>means and and the careers that you can<br>get<br>by doing the so the chartered<br>if rebecca you might need to unmute<br>yourself<br>i have unmuted myself perfect there you<br>are you popped up<br>are you able to start my video though<br>poppy because i can't start my video<br>because hostess stopped it<br>oh yes bear with me if you want to do<br>introductions while i<br>am starting your video all right good<br>everyone my name is rebecca kennedy i'm<br>a careers engagement manager at<br>chartered accountants and<br>quite obviously poppy and i chose not to<br>study int<br>and you can tell it's showing when you<br>have some technical difficulties<br>um but hopefully that doesn't stop us<br>from having an amazing<br>session there we go kia ora um<br>so i'm really really excited to be here<br>as part of this presentation with all of<br>you tonight<br>i'm a little bit biased in that i think<br>accounting is the single<br>greatest most exciting interesting<br>dynamic profession you could possibly<br>ever imagine<br>um so kudos to all of you for engaging<br>with this<br>presentation and coming along to find<br>out what studying accounting might look<br>like and where a career as a chartered<br>accountant<br>might be able to take you chartered<br>accountants<br>are sought after by employers all over<br>the world<br>employers really look for chartered<br>accountants because of their unique<br>skill set<br>um because of their commercial acumen<br>the ethical judgment<br>their professionalism and also their<br>leadership abilities<br>so if you're able to get that ca<br>designation next to your name<br>you know that it's something that's<br>trusted and internationally recognized<br>so if you become a chartered accountant<br>it really does become your passport to<br>an international career<br>and we will touch on career pathways and<br>what that might look like in a little<br>bit<br>but if we talk about a passport to a<br>career how do you get that passport how<br>do you become a chartered accountant<br>um so in order to become a chartered<br>accountant you need to complete<br>our professional program which we call<br>the ca program<br>in order to enter the ca program you<br>firstly need to have<br>a recognized bachelor's or master's<br>degree and you also need to meet<br>academic requirements that are<br>prerequisites for entry into the program<br>so if you study the traditional mpa at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>that's what it will give you your<br>masters of professional accounting gives<br>you that recognized master's degree<br>but it also makes sure that all of the<br>papers that you do tick off all of those<br>knowledge areas we need as a<br>prerequisite<br>into the ca program so once you complete<br>your masters of professional<br>accounting you can then complete a<br>provisional membership<br>application to chartered accountants we<br>have a look at your transcript make sure<br>that you've met all the requirements<br>and then you become a provisional member<br>with us once you're a provisional member<br>you get to enroll in the ca program now<br>the ca program has two main components<br>to it<br>the first one is a study component so<br>that's where you complete five technical<br>modules which also include professional<br>exams<br>the second component is three years of<br>relevant work experience under the<br>guidance of a chartered accountant<br>mentor<br>so that's your pathway to childhood<br>accountancy<br>if you do the traditional mpa pathway so<br>you do your 16 months mpa professional<br>membership you then do your five<br>technical modules<br>and also your three years practical<br>experience however<br>if you do the mpa with the ca pathway<br>you can kind of fast track your way to<br>becoming a chartered accountant a little<br>bit<br>what that means is when you do your mpa<br>papers<br>the ca program technical modules or five<br>of them are actually<br>embedded into the study that you're<br>doing while you're completing your mpa<br>so it means when you graduate not only<br>do you have your mpa<br>but you've also completed all five<br>technical modules<br>which means that all that's outstanding<br>in your ca program is just to get your<br>three years<br>relevant practical experience um<br>now i've talked to alzena and some of<br>the other students in the mpa program as<br>well who chose<br>ca pathway and i said to them why did<br>why did you choose the ca pathway versus<br>the traditional and<br>they had two main reasons for me the<br>first one was<br>they really liked the idea that they<br>could do these professional exams<br>and our chartered accountant program<br>technical modules<br>under the guidance of the academic staff<br>of victoria university of wellington<br>they really liked that they had<br>academics they could go to and ask<br>questions<br>and just give that extra support to give<br>them far more confidence about their<br>studies<br>and then the second reason they gave me<br>is<br>they really wanted to to jumpstart their<br>ability<br>to become part of the profession so the<br>fact that they were able to do their<br>technical modules while they were<br>studying<br>meant that they also became provisional<br>members of chartered accountants while<br>they were studying<br>which meant that they opened up access<br>to all of the benefits of membership<br>and they're able to start attending<br>events accessing member resources<br>starting to network with the accounting<br>community and profession and actually<br>you start to build their profile as an<br>emerging accountant<br>which they found really exciting and<br>amazing and a really great opportunity<br>right next slide<br>all right so you've done your mpa and<br>you're either<br>currently a provisional membership<br>working through the ca program or you've<br>finished the ca program<br>but where does that take you where do<br>you land what's the aspiration of why<br>you want to do that and where you could<br>go<br>and when people ask me which accountancy<br>can take them i say<br>honestly the opportunities are limitless<br>when we talk about chartered accountants<br>we often talk about<br>difference makers the idea that<br>chartered accountants are out there on<br>the front lines<br>and a whole host of different<br>organizations making a difference<br>not just for the organizations but for<br>communities<br>for economies and for society it sounds<br>very lofty but accountants really do<br>make a difference<br>but you also get to make a difference<br>for yourself personally as well<br>when you become a chartered accountant<br>and you become a qualified professional<br>you really are committing to a lifetime<br>of learning<br>and upskilling and in a process of<br>really building yourself up<br>as a professional which is really really<br>exciting um so in terms of career<br>pathways i know when i was a student<br>studying accounting<br>i didn't think there was much you could<br>do with an accounting degree to be<br>perfectly honest<br>i thought you would sit at a desk and i<br>thought you'd do some tax returns<br>and maybe some interview report and<br>extra numbers and some calculators<br>thrown in and that's all of that<br>accounting was<br>um but charted accountants these days<br>can be found<br>um in the real engine room driving all<br>sorts of organizations from<br>accountancy firms to commercial firms<br>corporates government charities<br>um not-for-profits and anything in<br>between that i've missed<br>um and the range of work that accounts<br>can do is so dynamic and interesting<br>and you can really find something that<br>suits your own skill set and your<br>personality and your value set as well<br>and if we look at the accounting uh<br>careers of the future<br>they're far beyond just your traditional<br>service lines of audit and taxation<br>financial accounting and management<br>accounting<br>you can move into some super cool<br>dynamic areas that are still<br>actually evolving forensic accounting<br>you can look at public accounting or<br>rural agricultural accounting<br>um accountants are having a huge role to<br>play in cyber security and<br>risk management and consultancy<br>corporate finance strategic performance<br>the options are honestly limitless<br>so when you're thinking about becoming a<br>difference maker<br>think about that sort of difference that<br>you want to make<br>because no matter what your value set<br>there's somewhere where with your<br>accounting skill set you'll be able to<br>actually make a difference and if you're<br>not sure what that difference you can<br>make looks like yet<br>um that's one of the things that i'm<br>here for um so i think my contact<br>information<br>i will be up at the end of the<br>presentation please feel free to get in<br>touch with me i would love to hear<br>about your experience and your story and<br>your journey<br>and help you work out exactly where a<br>career in accounting might be able to<br>take you<br>brilliant thank you rebecca and so we<br>will pause now if people do have<br>questions specifically<br>about the mpa um so we don't have any<br>questions at the moment so<br>do fire them through otherwise we will<br>move on and start talking about the<br>master of global business but we will<br>come back to questions<br>and like i said if we don't have time to<br>answer them live<br>this evening we will contact everybody<br>and<br>who send a question through and answer<br>them for them we also i've just had um<br>one of my colleagues said that my screen<br>was a little bit too small while rebecca<br>was talking<br>so we will send the slides out so if you<br>do want to see some examples of those<br>careers that rebecca was<br>talking about and so talking about those<br>steps that she mentioned<br>and we will also be sending that out but<br>for the next um<br>time when we're doing this feel free to<br>click on my uh my slide<br>you will get a beautiful big picture of<br>my face so please ignore that but you<br>will be able to see the slides while<br>fiona is talking so looks like we don't<br>have any questions coming through here<br>so<br>thank you rebecca she is going to be<br>here in the background as well so do<br>fire questions through<br>but we will move on now to our master of<br>global business so and for the master of<br>global business it is really similar to<br>the master professional accounting<br>how it's set up who it's for so i'm not<br>going to go into too much information<br>uh if it's different if so if it doesn't<br>differ from the master of professional<br>accounting<br>other than to say it is for students who<br>are interested in global business and<br>you do not need to have a background in<br>it<br>it is a program which it takes 12 months<br>so it's a little bit shorter than a<br>master of professional accounting<br>and it's taught in three trimesters so<br>it is that 12-month calendar year<br>a really exciting development we've had<br>with this program is that<br>you can now start it in any trimester so<br>if you're not sure when you want to<br>start<br>definitely look at it for the november<br>start time but if you can't make it then<br>you can look at starting at other other<br>periods<br>it is taught a little bit differently to<br>the master of professional accounting<br>where it has weekday classes and and<br>those weekday classes are in blocks<br>so what that means is you come in for a<br>couple of hours on a set<br>day and that's when you have your week<br>your weekly class<br>if you're studying full-time it means<br>you will be on campus<br>a fair amount because you will be having<br>your blocks for every single class that<br>you're taking<br>and it's about four courses three or<br>four courses you'll be taking for<br>full-time study<br>and again there it's best suited for<br>graduates from any discipline wanting to<br>to be accepted into this masters program<br>it is similar to the master of<br>professional accounting where you do<br>need a bachelor's degree<br>which can be in any discipline but with<br>this program here you do need to be<br>average<br>you also need to be accepted by the<br>program director similar to the<br>other masters and the program director<br>for this one is christian yao<br>you also if you're an international<br>student student need proof of english<br>proficiency and again we will explain<br>what that means in a little bit more<br>detail<br>shortly now the structure of this<br>program<br>is a little bit more flexible than the<br>the master of professional accounting<br>because you're not needing to meet the<br>accounting requirements<br>for the other program so how it's split<br>up is we have six core courses<br>and the core courses here are to give<br>you a really strong foundation in global<br>business<br>so you take courses in management and<br>marketing and global strategy and<br>managing people across cultures<br>so it gives you that really solid<br>foundation<br>then you get to take electives so four<br>electives or four<br>interest courses and these interest<br>courses here are to help make the degree<br>your own so it gives you that special<br>flavor<br>so if you're interested in global<br>business but also marketing<br>then you can take electives in the<br>marketing area and if you take enough<br>courses in one particular area<br>you can end up with a specialization<br>students can choose whether to<br>specialize or not<br>so it just means that they don't<br>specialize they have some more<br>flexibility to take different subjects<br>where specialization means<br>more subjects in a particular area in<br>those elective courses<br>we then finish the program with a<br>consultancy project<br>so this is where students use all the<br>skills and the knowledge that they've<br>built up through their core courses and<br>their electives<br>and in their final trimester of studying<br>with us it's where they get partnered<br>with an organization<br>and use the skills to help them with a<br>business issue<br>so this project is you you do a brief<br>you do research<br>and you work with with the business and<br>help them with a global issue that they<br>it's a very big on applied learning<br>similar to our masters of professional<br>accounting<br>the idea is that you're going to finish<br>and end up with skills that can<br>you can start using in your career<br>straight away<br>so like the consultancy projects that i<br>mentioned just before<br>you're having skills that you can learn<br>and and use<br>also through our teaching we have lots<br>of ways to engage online<br>and we have a project in there managing<br>people across cultures<br>where you actually get put into an<br>interactive team with people all across<br>the world and work together to help<br>solve a project<br>and and work with people so the<br>learnings that you're getting is really<br>applicable and really useful for you in<br>your early career<br>so talking about careers uh there's<br>there's many different things you can do<br>it it depends as well if you look to<br>specialize in a certain area that can<br>help you with your<br>certain career goals but if you want to<br>take a mixture of electives<br>it's going to give you a really strong<br>foundation in global business global<br>strategy<br>working with people and understanding<br>how the inner workings of business<br>work so we do<br>like i mentioned uh when i was talking<br>about the general professional programs<br>at the very beginning<br>and there's a lot of stuff embedded into<br>your program but then also networking<br>events<br>we have a fantastic award-winning<br>careers team on site as well to help you<br>with whatever your career step may be<br>and that's for this program and the<br>master of professional accounting<br>so that was quite a nice quick summary<br>of that program<br>and so again we'll open up if there are<br>any questions that that people may have<br>while we're just waiting for questions<br>to come through a common question that i<br>do get asked is about people starting um<br>in any trimester and what courses that<br>they should take<br>so the six core courses that i mentioned<br>they are spread out across the three<br>trimesters<br>so no matter what trimester you start in<br>you take two of the the global business<br>core<br>then alongside that if you're studying<br>full-time you take<br>two elective courses in each trimester<br>up until your final trimester<br>which is where you take that that<br>consultancy project<br>the program itself is 11 courses so it<br>is 180 point masters<br>so your final course that consultancy<br>project is a 30-point<br>course which just means it it takes um<br>it's more work than just a 15-point<br>course<br>so it's a full-time program for our<br>students<br>so i've just had a question here um<br>which pops up and says for international<br>students can they offered be deferred<br>for the next<br>intakes and we will get to that question<br>i will flick to the next slide because<br>i'm going to introduce our<br>international expert and she's going to<br>talk a little bit more about that<br>so we will pop in to the next slide and<br>i will introduce fiona man from the<br>wellington university<br>can you see me yeah you're you're there<br>and loud so perfect<br>great um okay great well good evening<br>everyone<br>i'm really excited to be here as part of<br>this<br>wellington business school information<br>session<br>my name is fiona as poppy mentioned and<br>i work at<br>wellington university international so<br>our international office deals with<br>pretty much<br>everything international at the<br>university so<br>from your application from applying to<br>the university<br>to enrollment to any issues you have<br>when you are here<br>insurance visa pastoral care<br>student support so we we're kind of all<br>the way through the process<br>and you also have to apply directly to<br>the international office<br>um to any program so our domestic<br>students in new zealand will have one<br>application process and they'll apply<br>through one office<br>and international students will apply<br>directly to the international<br>office um so<br>a little bit so it's oh sorry i can't<br>see the slide let me just pin that slide<br>so i can see what is written there okay<br>great um so do you want to go to<br>the next slide poppy oh that's proof of<br>english<br>okay um so when you apply to the<br>university as an international student<br>you it depends really on where where<br>you're applying from so some students<br>might have to apply and use an agent<br>and you'll use an agent to submit all of<br>your documents<br>some students you may be able to apply<br>directly online<br>so please do go to our website and have<br>a look put in<br>what um your nationality is and where<br>you're from<br>and then they'll it will tell you what<br>process you should go<br>through to apply applying is generally<br>quite straightforward<br>um so you just need to fill in an<br>application form which you can find<br>on our website it's just a couple of<br>pages it's um<br>pretty straightforward um you're always<br>going to need an application the<br>fundamental<br>application documents will be an<br>application form copy of your passport<br>and your academic transcripts<br>some programs require extra information<br>for example the master of global<br>business you do have to submit some<br>extra documents<br>which poppy will probably tell you about<br>and likewise for the master of<br>professional accounting<br>but in addition to that for<br>international students you need your<br>application form your passport<br>and your academics um if<br>english is not your first language or if<br>you have not studied at<br>a two in an institution that teaches in<br>english<br>um then you will need to also meet our<br>proof of english requirement<br>so basically at postgraduate level this<br>is equivalent to an ielts of 6.5<br>so there's also we also accept pte<br>toefl cambridge nd cell<br>so you can see all of them in detail on<br>this slide and also on our website<br>if you have studied at an english<br>institution or in an english-speaking<br>country then<br>your english requirement may be able to<br>be waived so please do get in touch<br>with us and we'll let you know if you<br>meet those requirements<br>um during covert 19 we understand that<br>some students will not be able to get to<br>a testing center<br>so we do have some other special<br>requirements specifically during this<br>period for students who are applying in<br>2020 or 2021 so<br>these are all on our international<br>website so please go<br>to see them if you do have<br>want to see the detail but in addition<br>to what's on the slide here<br>we're also accepting the toefl ibt<br>special home addition test<br>and the ielts indicator test and for<br>students who live in mainland china and<br>iran<br>only they can submit the duolingo<br>english test so to have a look more at<br>the detail please go to our website<br>um so that's a bit about application<br>about english<br>um if you don't meet our english program<br>we actually also do have an english<br>proficiency program<br>so if you would like to um if if you<br>haven't met the 6.5 equivalent in ielts<br>and you need to study a little bit more<br>and you do want to do that in new<br>zealand we also have an english language<br>program<br>which is for 12 weeks and if you pass<br>that test then you'll meet the<br>academic entry requirements for the<br>program<br>so that is also on our website as well<br>so lastly i just wanted to talk a little<br>bit about scholarships<br>um so we do not have any full<br>scholarships<br>at the university so only if you're<br>doing maybe a phd<br>or research later on you'll be able to<br>get potentially apply for a full<br>scholarship<br>we do have partial international<br>scholarships so our main one for<br>international students is called the<br>tongarewa scholarship<br>this one students can gain between five<br>and ten thousand dollars towards their<br>tuition fees<br>um we do have three rounds per year that<br>you can apply so it doesn't matter if<br>you're starting in trimester one<br>two or three you'll be able to apply for<br>that<br>four students from latin america as well<br>we do have a latin american excellent<br>scholarship which you can<br>apply for and this is also worth a<br>similar view<br>so do check out the scholarships page<br>you might be eligible for other<br>scholarships that were<br>very specific to you in your situation<br>but those are the two<br>international ones i wanted to highlight<br>here today<br>so for sam's question for international<br>students can often be deferred for the<br>next intake<br>yes it can so you can apply for your<br>offer to be deferred<br>um it's not automatic though so it does<br>go back to the program director and they<br>do have to accept it again<br>so usually it is quite straightforward<br>unless you've told that you're<br>going into a limited entry or<br>competitive program<br>but it does it's not kind of automatic<br>you do need to apply<br>but it's really great that we've got so<br>many intakes for these programs<br>um now so if you do need to defer<br>then you don't need to wait too long to<br>be able to start it again<br>i'm not sure if you if anyone<br>if the international students are in the<br>country at the moment or if they're<br>overseas at the moment<br>um but we do get quite a few questions<br>about um the borders when are they going<br>to open when are students going to be<br>able to come into the country<br>um so we don't know uh you will know<br>probably when we know um when the<br>borders are open<br>so um it is we hope that they will be<br>open<br>in time well international students will<br>be able to come into the country early<br>next year<br>but it is really hard to tell with us<br>forever changing covert 19 situation<br>um so we are processing applications as<br>per usual<br>um so students are applying to come in<br>in<br>trimester three and trimester one<br>at closer to that stage we'll know what<br>the situation is<br>and then you'll be given the option to<br>defer your studies or for some programs<br>maybe start your studies<br>online as well so we will keep you<br>updated<br>but once you do have an application in<br>our system then we will<br>be able to update you on everything that<br>is happening in that area and support<br>you the best that we can<br>for you to come and start your studies<br>great did you have any other questions<br>does anyone have any questions or poppy<br>did you want me to mention something<br>else specifically about<br>international no i thought that was<br>perfect<br>we'll wait to see if there are other<br>questions but i do just want to add uh<br>with that<br>with these two programs we are if<br>international students are applying<br>we are seeing the numbers of students<br>coming in so if you do<br>if you're not sure whether or not you<br>can make it to the country for your<br>trimester three intake<br>definitely keep in touch with us because<br>we are looking at offering online<br>options<br>so for this trimester that we currently<br>we started on monday<br>we do have options for students online<br>and in person<br>so we do we are very flexible and we can<br>talk to students about their situation<br>and see what what program what we can do<br>for the particular program that they're<br>interested in<br>and i know we've we've been in touch<br>them so um yeah we will definitely<br>keep in touch and give you all the<br>information that we can about<br>what it's going to look like going<br>forward for trimester 3 and then into<br>2021<br>perfect there doesn't seem to be any<br>questions at the moment<br>so um thank you fiona again fiona<br>sticking around in the back<br>we do just have a couple more slides<br>that i will go through and so please do<br>definitely<br>fire those questions through if you do<br>have them there the last<br>few ques uh sorry slides are really for<br>domestic students because uh fiona<br>covered the international students there<br>but just to quickly touch on<br>scholarships for our domestic<br>based students against really similar<br>the scholarship database that i have<br>listed on the screen so go to our<br>website and then slash scholarships<br>that's a really good database that lists<br>all of the scholarships available<br>in new zealand right now and<br>specifically for victoria university<br>wellington but also<br>other independent scholarships they<br>change<br>quite regularly new ones get added some<br>scholarships close<br>so i do recommend just keeping an eye on<br>that scholarship database to see what's<br>out there and what you can apply for<br>the link i have at the bottom there's<br>study link again this is for domestic<br>students<br>this is the way that people can get some<br>government support for their study so<br>it's our student loan scheme in new<br>zealand<br>so if you are domestic based student<br>definitely have a look at study link<br>because they can help you with with your<br>fees<br>then apply so for the international<br>students fiona went over<br>over this application process just<br>before so if you do have questions again<br>flick them through<br>but i will just mention the domestic<br>student application because it is a<br>little bit different to<br>our international students this one here<br>again you can apply online but<br>um and you can apply right now for<br>trimester three<br>so our november start if you're looking<br>at starting any later then trimester<br>three<br>you can't apply just yet our application<br>opens in october<br>now you do have to have some supporting<br>documents just like fiona mentioned for<br>our international students<br>and these are things like proof of<br>residency uh your passport<br>and for your um for the master of global<br>business<br>you do need to supply this is both for<br>domestic and international students<br>a statement of your career intent so<br>explaining what you want to get out of<br>the program what your goals are<br>and and really yeah what you see your<br>goal your career goals might be for the<br>next five to ten years<br>all of your documents including academic<br>transcript from previous study<br>goes to our academic program leads so<br>chris and christian that i mentioned<br>before<br>and they do assess your application and<br>then they will give you if you're<br>successful an offer of study so if you<br>are thinking about studying november<br>i've got the date there for our domestic<br>students it's the 27th of october<br>sometimes applications can take a little<br>bit of time so we do encourage you to<br>apply sooner rather than later<br>just so we can start the application<br>process for you and be able to help you<br>work out what courses and things like<br>that you might want to do<br>and the final thing i'm going to touch<br>on is just how you can get in touch with<br>us<br>so we are hopefully you've realized this<br>evening we are very friendly<br>we do love to help you it can be very<br>confusing working out what the right<br>course
