i<br>studied at an anatomy were<br>bioanthropology which is the study of<br>in neuroscience my favorite the brain<br>i'm obsessed with it<br>look at it hey everybody my name is<br>christine and i'm a lecturer in the<br>department of anatomy<br>and i'm here today to tell you a little<br>bit about what study and anatomy is all<br>about<br>at the university of otago now i think<br>when a lot of people hear anatomy as a<br>subject they think of<br>skeletons and maybe guts and that kind<br>of stuff but<br>what i really wanted to get across to<br>you is that while that's true that those<br>things do happen in anatomy<br>there's lots of other stuff that happens<br>in anatomy and you'll learn all that<br>stuff<br>in your study i mean the one way that<br>you can think about anatomy is that<br>we're interested in<br>the subject of anatomy in understanding<br>how the body<br>is put together and how that makes it<br>function in the way that it does<br>of course we're also interested in<br>understanding what happens when it<br>breaks or when we have diseases<br>and then how we can maybe try different<br>ways of fixing it<br>when it does break or when we have<br>diseases now the thing that's cool about<br>anatomy is i told you it was quite broad<br>and the thing that's really nice about<br>that is if you come to university of<br>otago to study anatomy<br>is that you will be able to study all of<br>these things<br>about your body and about our bodies as<br>well as some things about<br>how humans have evolved and come to<br>populate the pacific by studying their<br>skeletons<br>and i'll tell you a little bit more<br>about that in a bit but um the thing<br>that's really cool about it is that<br>because it's so varied it allows you to<br>craft a degree<br>that is fit for you so you can we have a<br>lot of different papers and the way the<br>degree is structured allows you to<br>study just the things that you really<br>like and you get to emphasize those and<br>learn a lot more about those<br>so i came here in first year studying<br>health sciences<br>to be adopted but i fell in love with<br>this guy right here<br>and just got obsessed with anatomy and<br>the lecturers and<br>the lab demonstrators just support you<br>and just further like<br>so you have so many questions that you<br>want to ask you just get answers but<br>then they just provide more questions<br>and then you just get more answers<br>it's an obsession so in addition to<br>those um<br>topics that tony told you about that<br>she's really super interested in<br>we have a couple of other areas of um of<br>study in anatomy that other people also<br>find really interesting and that's<br>reproduction and development<br>so that's kind of trying to understand<br>how your body developed like how it took<br>its form even before you were born<br>um and also there's a we have a subject<br>called clinical and functional anatomy<br>and this is where<br>um things like bones and the more<br>traditional anatomy study come into play<br>um and in in that area of study people<br>are really interested in understanding<br>things like you know why is it that<br>knees<br>always go out when people play sport or<br>how can i fix this bad back that's<br>really been bothering me<br>so as you can see i hope that um the<br>choices that you have in anatomy are<br>really very very broad<br>and can really help you to understand<br>yourself and your place in the world<br>so i came here to study medicine only<br>two places in new zealand operate<br>auckland and otago<br>but i fell in love with research well<br>for now and that's the greatest part<br>everything that you study just opens<br>another door like christine was saying<br>i do research at the moment but i could<br>also enter medicine next year<br>or i could go into government policy and<br>change things my options are limitless<br>and otago has taught me that<br>so as you can probably imagine because<br>anatomy is so<br>broad it's quite popular and what that<br>means is that we have<br>a lot of students who also are majoring<br>in anatomy<br>and so our com our student community is<br>really robust it's big<br>you've got lots of exposure to other<br>anatomy majors and i think i'll leave it<br>to tony actually to tell you a little<br>bit more about what the anatomy student<br>community is all about and and what that<br>will afford you in your study<br>so the community is so wide and you meet<br>such a diverse range of people that are<br>so like-minded but so<br>crazy you know i meet my lab partner<br>and reproductive and developmental<br>biology we became friends and then we<br>became flatmates<br>how crazy so the last thing that really<br>i wanted to tell you about is<br>what do you do after you get out and you<br>have a degree in anatomy<br>well people who've majored in anatomy<br>over the years have ended up in<br>an enormous variety of careers the<br>variety that you get in anatomy<br>is mirrored by the variety of career<br>opportunities that you have when you<br>come out<br>so not surprisingly a lot of people go<br>into the health professions so things<br>like medicine dentistry<br>physiotherapy but also a lot of people<br>in allied health professions so<br>nursing optometry ophthalmology<br>genetic counseling those kinds of things<br>are quite popular<br>we also have people who have taken on<br>roles as teachers of biology and anatomy<br>and science teachers<br>also a lot of people who go into science<br>communication<br>you could go into research so if you<br>really get into the study that you do in<br>anatomy you might find yourself doing<br>some research in anatomy<br>and then finally one of the really<br>popular places that people go<br>is into government and communicating<br>science to government<br>and so that science can inform policy<br>making that<br>government officials consider when when<br>they're making policy about how the</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
