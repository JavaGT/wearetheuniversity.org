cool Kilda I'm sure everyone<br>my name is Corey I'm one of the<br>accessibility advisors my name's Terry<br>on accessibility advisor<br>yeah my tech knowledge be part of our<br>presentation we've got one of our<br>students who's registered with us her<br>name is Mel Rhodes so she will talk on<br>her behalf about her experience being<br>under our service and what's right for<br>her as you could see in this first slide<br>we thought we would begin with our<br>vision which has to work collaboratively<br>with students at the University of<br>Waikato to empower individuals with<br>impairments to reach their goals and the<br>team here for in the potential these<br>tumours I thought might be important to<br>to hold on to as collaboratively an<br>empowerment this is something that we we<br>would like to kind of foster around in<br>extremes like himself or those<br>experiences on them given that we work<br>together collectively to empower you<br>some of the things like to touch on just<br>at the start is about your name<br>accessibility services so we are part of<br>the Disability Support Center but it's a<br>point to understand why we recently<br>changed our name as of year-and-a-half<br>ago in a few years maybe just reduce<br>stigma learning for students who<br>currently experience an agreement but<br>also throughout your journey and the<br>and before sorry can we talk about where<br>we're located um if you have any<br>questions just type it up on the on<br>their chat bar then we're answer it<br>after this so we were located so you<br>would basically Hamilton campus as you<br>can see in this picture here we're in<br>the Student Center<br>Oh so what do you might critical library<br>building opposite the campus porkchops<br>piscatella T is access points for those<br>who you know a mobility issues that he<br>is less there<br>and as you can see through the doors<br>just to the left of your screen we see<br>an antenna accessibility services so<br>we're pretty much close to the entrance<br>we also like to acknowledge we're like<br>even though we're based here obviously<br>these students all over the country<br>especially Tirana we have some awesome<br>Turanga staff there who are willing to<br>support you for your experience and they<br>can definitely help out with kind of<br>engaging around accessibility support<br>they get in contact with us and so we is<br>that kind of transition there so for<br>those of my students it's good the way<br>yeah we do get over to tour as well so<br>you know if we need to get over the air<br>if you're on like you say in your<br>weather we can get over there maybe we<br>really do so same services run and<br>throat on that as we run hearing<br>services so cool lastly I'd like to also<br>acknowledge those students who are<br>distance learning as well you know<br>accessibility services definitely can<br>help in that space even if you're<br>located on the other side of the country<br>to let you know if your distance<br>alright this so thought before we get<br>into the registration process it<br>probably good to understand who can<br>access the services<br>so here's it became range from many<br>different things from like long term<br>chronic issues get more the physical we<br>have those with vision impairments<br>hearing impairments mobility issues when<br>a wheelchair or crutches somehow this<br>final issues as well through to the<br>specific learning disabilities so that<br>come under dyslexia dysgraphia<br>dyscalculia um so there's always stuff<br>you don't see as well it's important to<br>see acknowledge those well under the<br>spectrum disorder and definitely mental<br>health society<br>depression and these are kind of the<br>common concerns that most of the<br>students with experience working with<br>may be yes it's probably good far I mean<br>is impacting on study potentiating<br>cancer for you so were always open to a<br>conversation willing to look at whatever<br>the Nader's and how we can support yeah<br>and also love to highlight temporal<br>injuries all those you you know you<br>might have an accident or have surgery<br>and it's only for short period of time<br>this service is also for you as well get<br>a high number of students you're not<br>aware that some of those services we<br>help out with they could have you know<br>exist earlier so keep them keep that in<br>mind so with the registration process<br>it's a free service technology so you<br>don't have to pay anything and if you<br>actually sell services a workshop would<br>make academic transcripts if you're<br>worried about that it doesn't follow you<br>so it doesn't follow that you've used<br>the super scope what rule now is a pre<br>quitting so you have just just make each<br>other the playing fields over yeah so<br>and that leads into like confidentiality<br>so part of the process is we give you a<br>form you fill it out and it's normally<br>with a supporting document so from a<br>doctor or a specialist very confidential<br>so that means between our service we<br>store everything on a digital folder<br>when you myself interior has access to<br>it and also like to highlight a bit<br>about consent so the consent around<br>registration is when you sign up with us<br>you can see for us to make contact with<br>your lecturers but definitely it's not<br>in detail describing everything that<br>you're experiencing just then your the<br>existing services and we can mediate<br>with them but generally we're gonna have<br>a conversation with you beforehand<br>letting you know that we're looking at<br>having a conversation with so many<br>academic staff so you're involved in it<br>yeah and you know we got a high number<br>of students who say for most of your<br>study experience from high school you've<br>never had that assessment you know and<br>but we're willing more than willing to<br>kind of help out with that process we<br>get students who may have experienced<br>this leek soup or not have a formal<br>diagnosis don't worry about their come<br>and see us<br>more willing than happy to help that<br>just so it's kind of no restricting any<br>any other supports that we can offer<br>there yeah alright so yes so that's just<br>talking about our registration process<br>again the supporting documentation that<br>we need so we're more than happy for you<br>to fill out the medical form that we<br>have as part of our registration or if<br>you have something as well that's<br>current and when we say current this is<br>a tricky one we will accept dated<br>documentation if we're looking at<br>specific learning so like the dyslexia<br>and assessment so we know that they can<br>take place in childhood or entertain<br>generally we know that they don't<br>fluctuate and change too much except us<br>yeah and and it's important for us to<br>know that even though we it's good to<br>have that kind of recommendation because<br>it highlights for us that you also seek<br>and support some of the university we're<br>really looking at holistically as well<br>so we want to make sure that you're not<br>only supported through our service here<br>through the other services at the<br>University here is also that engagement<br>because there's a lot of things that we<br>understand happens outside of uni so<br>so this slide here so I would like to<br>talk about one of our supports so<br>justice around test and exam<br>arrangements can kind of give you a<br>better insight on what that looks like<br>so an example would be here if you<br>experienced asphyxia and and some of the<br>most common areas of support that we do<br>offer around for example reader/writer<br>support we understand these difficulties<br>and kind of understanding the content so<br>there's a lot of kind of going back and<br>forth checking their information and<br>they can use some time I mean you know<br>you're doing a test or exam and so as<br>you can see in this picture here we've<br>got one that has more of a cubical<br>situation you've got a kiss to yourself<br>you make on extra time if needed and to<br>the right it's more<br>separate room I have a reader right in<br>there as well we also have students who<br>have low back problems you know that's<br>just you in the room so if you feel<br>comfortable just standing up walking<br>around lying on the floor that's your<br>space there just so we can acknowledge<br>that there is a lot for you but it comes<br>down to this situation in your knowledge<br>trip so it's just for the 26 hands okay<br>so um so I mentioned earlier we have a<br>coming on board and you know<br>participating in this presentation hey<br>look it's my pleasure absolute pleasure<br>I'm happy to be here and to have support<br>what you offering for perspective<br>students coming up and this you know not<br>a problem also well we'll use this fun<br>to you thank you absolutely so first off<br>I'd like to give a big thank you very<br>much to Terry and to Cory who have<br>supported me throughout my journey I<br>haven't come to the internet yet so<br>they're gonna see me for a little while<br>but my name is Mel groves I'm based in<br>at all today and sometimes I travel over<br>where it's necessary to the campus there<br>in Hamilton I'm in my second year as a<br>psychology and human development major<br>doing a Bachelor of social science and<br>it wasn't an easy thing for me<br>personally to skip into I'm what you<br>would consider maybe an older student<br>even though it I feel that way 37 in it<br>it was because of my disability that<br>held me back from believing that I was<br>capable of taking part in higher forms<br>of education so when I firmly made the<br>decision to I needed to investigate what<br>sorts of support networks I can access<br>and upon my mr. Goethe and I come across<br>the accessibility services and started<br>emailing Terry just asking him how do I<br>access the support what sorts of things<br>do I need to do in order to jump on<br>board and and he reigned through very<br>similar forms of information and watch<br>they delivering<br>this webinar which is very familiar to<br>the stuff that I read in my first<br>initial email so I as Terry and Cory<br>explained I needed to see a specialist<br>and have a diagnosis I hear they're<br>going to be a bit more lenient on those<br>who suspect they may have the disorder<br>now but back when I did a day I went out<br>and it was really important for me to<br>just on a personal level to have that<br>firm diagnosis done so dyslexia is a<br>neurological disorder and it's on a<br>spectrum it's actually more common than<br>people think so if you do suspect that<br>you have dyslexia you're probably right<br>and it affects one in every five<br>students so that's quite a large portion<br>of students really when you think about<br>it and being us on a spectrum you will<br>have your head dyslexia to a certain<br>degree so I'm not saying that you do you<br>don't I'm just saying if you believe you<br>may it's worth checking out anyway so I<br>had my assessment and finally I was able<br>to jump on board I signed all my forms<br>like the boys were speaking of and we<br>linked from there the some of the<br>services that I was able to tap into<br>were the especially around assessments<br>so a reader and writer at one point I<br>think they even offered me a note-taker<br>but there are there are other notes that<br>you can access sometimes if the<br>literature is feeling kind enough to put<br>them online but they're not taking for a<br>while was really helpful we also had for<br>me as a form of support was the reader<br>and the writer when it came to<br>assessments now with dyslexia and for<br>those who who are not aware it really is<br>about the abstraction of absorbing with<br>written forms of language so I'm a big<br>sort of audio learner and when I have<br>things read to me I'm able to absorb<br>that information a lot with a lot more<br>clarity in then I can if I'm just to<br>read the information on a piece of paper<br>so it's important to have someone there<br>they can either hear me read and then<br>correct - and I get something wrong or<br>they<br>read for me in the Nike accurately<br>gathered information which is really<br>important when you're trying to answer<br>examination questions because it makes<br>the difference between answering that<br>question right and act seeing it wrong<br>is your ability to determine what the<br>question is asking in the first place<br>other forms of support that I received<br>from the disabilities services as well<br>or the accessibility service sorry there<br>are computers stashed around the place<br>on the floors on there is a few flaws<br>we've got a accessibilities computer<br>there that you can use and I found them<br>really helpful because they've got<br>special quite specialized programs on<br>those computers that can help reading<br>content nets on the screen so that's<br>been really helpful with me before I<br>started my journey like I said I wasn't<br>too sure whether or not University was a<br>place that it was going to sort of be a<br>nurturing environment for me and anybody<br>who has a disability I like to think<br>that it's almost like a track and field<br>race where on your on your track when<br>you have a disability you've got all<br>these extra little hurdles that you try<br>and run in there to jump over and then<br>you've got to complete the race somehow<br>but with the disability service they try<br>and eliminate some of these hurdles for<br>you and help helping to communicate with<br>lecturers on your behalf especially if<br>you don't sort of you know you don't<br>feel as though you want to do something<br>for yourself or if you can that's really<br>great and I'll support you to do that as<br>well and the boys there are just<br>absolutely the gyms when they're coming<br>when it comes to supporting anybody<br>through their journey and education but<br>the University of Waikato and so other<br>things too maybe there will be times<br>where I have a test and I need to use a<br>computer so that's great too because<br>computer can be set up and in a way<br>where you're able to do all your tests<br>examinations on the computer and then<br>the information has been taken off the<br>computer ending and painted over and<br>obviously if you're having difficulties<br>with reading and writing the computer<br>with its spell check is another way of<br>you being able to be more empowered to<br>right on your own without having a<br>writer there but you also may need to<br>have the reader there so it's all about<br>empowering and it's all about allowing<br>you to show what your abilities are and<br>taking this focus away on your<br>disabilities so that's just a little bit<br>from me but if anybody does have any<br>questions I'm more than happy to answer<br>if anyone would like to get in contact<br>with either Tyrael Cory and and ask me<br>something privately I'm more than happy<br>to help as well there are little tricks<br>and tips that I've happen to to collect<br>along the way but I'm going to share<br>them with the boys and allow them to<br>share them with you all and wishing you<br>guys all the best with your journey and<br>I hope to see you around and if you<br>bundle to me don't be shy please say hi<br>alright guys thank you so much hey Thank<br>You mal thank you for your time and<br>mostly for you know everybody know this<br>is a kind of you know chat with you as<br>well yeah I just really want to<br>acknowledge now and if you can take a<br>leaf of her book I know Bella somebody<br>who is very proactive proactive in lots<br>of ways but proactive and things aren't<br>going well for her in regards to study<br>chiquita early and time she's involved<br>us because she can't problem sort of<br>herself so and just starts that I would<br>think so I really just encourage you all<br>if things aren't going well<br>come see us check to us wimple and<br>heavier to problem-solve with you know<br>that's not us yeah thanks again bill<br>yeah thanks Mel and I'll move to the<br>next slide Mel mentioned some other<br>supports so the previous one you talked<br>about mainly to do some exams about the<br>areas as you can see note-taking<br>so maybe you can just talk a bit about<br>what each support looks like since their<br>note-taking this is essentially having a<br>note-taker in the classrooms and these<br>are like the big lecture rooms and heavy<br>Nexus to those minutes and I'm going to<br>take as a essentially students who are<br>and build a net paper as well and and<br>important thing about the note takers<br>they need to caption<br>the very most important parts of the<br>next a lot can be said<br>I guess fortunately we here is the<br>online access as well but that doesn't<br>take away the fact that we still have<br>the note-taking service so we're there<br>note-taking service there reading<br>material and alternative formats we've<br>got a number of for example students<br>with visual impairments and they you<br>know you use certain software it kind of<br>helps with the reading and so just<br>adjusting some of for example PDF<br>documents you might find on anything<br>online and maybe there's a proper way to<br>format there so the software could work<br>so we can work around their example sign<br>language interpreting is pretty<br>straightforward we contract with an<br>external the sign language interpreter<br>so content and that last point around<br>advocating liaison unit in lectures even<br>they can cover a range of things we one<br>thing could be like if house service<br>might not be the most appropriate we get<br>a limit on what we can help out with it<br>can definitely a learning leaders but<br>also other services yeah we can now<br>again it comes back to our vision<br>statement of trying to empowering you<br>the student as much as possible but it<br>comes a time when you know we're more<br>than willing to kind of I guess step in<br>and maybe take a lead on a conversation<br>or anything like that or if things<br>potentially going as they should<br>according to you again we can advocate<br>and try and sort of see how we can help<br>them and change the situation as we do<br>for the bit definitely so this is our<br>contact details so yeah kind of both our<br>numbers email address if if you don't<br>have any credit hey focus in email know<br>the most students going and we're on it<br>pretty much from ours t realized that<br>one of us looking with you also our<br>location there and I'm so handsome<br>questions and leave your contact details<br>up what we're kind of going through this<br>so we have fun we have had a question<br>about access and the recording again I'm<br>not a hundred percent sure should be<br>tomorrow hell with that University<br>YouTube channel so if you YouTube<br>University of one console you should be<br>able to find what you need there to be<br>able to view these again so they'll pop<br>up again and we've had a question about<br>will we was only able to receive an<br>electronic documentation for diagnosis<br>absolutely absolutely if you can scan it<br>get it through to us worst case we don't<br>sort of encourage it but worst case we<br>also take photos as long as it's clear<br>and we can you know read the information<br>you know we will accept it but if you<br>want to drop it in that's absolutely<br>fine but scan email through that sort of<br>and it would be through the<br>accessibility services the mailbox but<br>yeah any any other questions that one<br>that anybody wants to sort of quickly<br>type of always so start slowly look at<br>written you know we weren't doing like<br>if not take a look at the video or even<br>email us here we go so that's the same<br>one yep so the only that's saying the<br>recording again okay so yeah again big<br>value on YouTube yeah well thank you for<br>London's so I'm sorry can I get some on<br>my registration now even the
