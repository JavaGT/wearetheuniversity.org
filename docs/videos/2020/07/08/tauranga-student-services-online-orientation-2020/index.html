wanted to save<br>me my room as and 1.28 which is just<br>around the corner from the hub and the<br>hours that I work Monday Tuesday 82 and<br>it's free to come see me to come see me<br>which was the most important thing yeah<br>I've just got a met yet it's kind of a<br>little bit confusing but it's only for<br>one and so all you need to do is just<br>you can always have somebody at<br>reception and I can through it to around<br>to the to where I am and yes 1.28 yes so<br>people can see me for any can anything<br>any kind of health advice a lot of<br>students come and they meet it is th ink<br>or a smear or 50s or emergency<br>contraception so anything to do with<br>sexual health also I'm going to person<br>that you come and see if you need any<br>mental health support yeah lots of<br>students come and talk about anything<br>you're going through next really sort<br>any ways that I can help you<br>so yeah this definitely one of the major<br>things that I see when people come see<br>me and also some people just come<br>they've got their fallen over they have<br>a ruin or something like that and so<br>they can come see me phonetic I usually<br>I like to follow the clip of that model<br>from this injury so it's like a holistic<br>way of working and so also to a few<br>months the way to come see me is you can<br>either just drop in and you can take<br>step number that's on the screen over to<br>two oh one three nine zero zero three<br>and that's that's my work phone so you<br>can click there and make<br>women or even just email me on Johnson<br>well there's information on the Student<br>Health website so you can just go into<br>the Waco tool page in second student<br>house and runs it on it and then you can<br>find it so it's pretty easy to find one<br>major thing that I can help you with<br>this opinion see a doctor so we have a<br>bit of a different system from the<br>Hamilton system we and what you can do<br>that we don't have the doctor on campus<br>that we have the closest one is about<br>two minutes walk away called a necessity<br>so if you wanted to enroll in adopters<br>which i think is really important<br>because if you really need to have your<br>own doctor that you can go to at any<br>time you can go to generate Medical<br>Center which actually has like four<br>different medical centers around the<br>total area but the closest one is South<br>City so it's really close from to the<br>turnover campus and tell so and it cost<br>$10 and so if you need a vet you just<br>come and see me and I can I can give you<br>a voucher to take to their Medical<br>Center in India and I only cost $15 so<br>it's really worth about doing and I<br>encourage all the students when they<br>come to stand earlier and and the really<br>wouldn't think today as a secular<br>community services gap which I think<br>it's just on the next screen and this<br>just means that instead of having to pay<br>$40 and well in any other medical center<br>if it goes down to $19 and yes that's<br>really really important that you can<br>take if you don't want to go to Sarah<br>listen to your own doctor but that<br>Community Services card can reduce your<br>doctor's visit and also does other<br>things as well any kind of prescriptions<br>or emergency dental care<br>and so every student is should have a<br>community services and if you don't you<br>all you need to do is ring up wins and<br>they will just post mine out to you so<br>if you have student allowance or student<br>loan then you can get a community<br>services that yes so that's something<br>really important and tonight now we also<br>don't have any councils on site at the<br>campus but we have them we use span<br>counseling which is on 10th Avenue just<br>beside that we house and so a lot of<br>students use and Bay counseling and get<br>stressed got got stuff going on at home<br>you just really want something to talk<br>to and you just want it to be<br>confidential it's a really good place to<br>go a lot of students abuse there and<br>it's found really helpful and so every<br>student is entitled to five free<br>sessions and all you have to do is call<br>five seven eight zero nine five nine and<br>make an appointment with the<br>receptionist anytime that suits you and<br>just correct your student ID card so<br>it's a really really good way of getting<br>that support that you need and it's all<br>confidential no Judas or anybody can<br>know about it and just you can go in<br>it's convenient for you and yeah if you<br>need help with trying to find a<br>counselor this really appropriate for<br>you you just want you know you're not<br>sure which one that you think would be<br>you might gel with you can just come and<br>check to me and I can help you with that<br>and one really cool thing that we have<br>is that the Hamilton campus doesn't have<br>as we have a physio on campus and they<br>are in the same room that I work out of<br>which is room 1.28 and stay but they<br>come on a Friday so this is a free<br>service to if you if you're an excellent<br>what if this is going off your is<br>covered by ACC so that's really good<br>service to have and it's really easy to<br>book to you just call Oh Stephen<br>ninety-seven three three zero yes a few<br>other ones we had people visiting from<br>the Hamilton campus one that I really<br>like to mention is a chaplain<br>and he comes every two weeks and he<br>usually just hangs out to happen if you<br>wanted to talk to him about any any type<br>of faiths or beliefs that you have is<br>really approachable and willing to talk<br>to talk to you about anything and he has<br>his contact details on the student<br>health website as well we also have a<br>birth prevention coordinator who<br>sometimes visits our campus and she does<br>concede modules and likes to talk about<br>anything to do with harassment or abuse<br>or violence or any concerns that you<br>might have a run there and it's really<br>important to this set we have access to<br>we also have a health promotion<br>coordinator at and he comes and yeah<br>every Tuesday and the last thing that I<br>talk about is our wellness room so we<br>have this open in free and Wednesday<br>from mental tone which has control down<br>and it's located in the bottom floor of<br>go3 and this is a space that we just<br>want people to be able to chill and<br>paintball games really execute to know<br>other people and there'll be food there<br>and it's somebody that we can just feel<br>like you can have a little break or a<br>quiet area just to relax sort of since<br>your time going from your stays which is<br>really important and yeah usually we do<br>have like and the workshops and things<br>planned during the year as well so it's<br>um something to look out forward and see<br>what's what's happening there and one<br>thing that I'm promoting at the moment<br>is if you want to eat your food next so<br>if you wanted to keep that we're doing<br>everybody on the same day so July 29th<br>and it's really important to<br>pay before a week beforehand which is in<br>the 20 seconds and it's really cheap so<br>it's only $15 and everybody can access<br>they get what we need is a voucher and<br>in time for me to just come and see me<br>you can either it comes to my office or<br>just email me or whatever is easiest for<br>you guys so the most important thing I<br>feel is I want everyone to know that we<br>are really approachable and you can come<br>talk to me about anything and all this<br>information is on the website and I'm<br>very happy to talk to you about anymore<br>is there anything that you have<br>so yeah that's me and I'm handed over to<br>get everyone I'm kept in
