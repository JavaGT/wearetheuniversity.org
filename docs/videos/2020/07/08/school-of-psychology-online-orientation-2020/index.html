am I am I welcome to a<br>psychology 2020 this year is a<br>challenging year for everybody because<br>we have coronavirus kovat 19 / d'emic<br>and of course psychology plays important<br>control here<br>welcome and good choice was choosing<br>psychology on psychology the school<br>psychology can offer you a large range<br>of options to study than any other<br>subject<br>psychology is everywhere these days in<br>particular for undergraduate psychology<br>degrees you can do psychology in three<br>different pathways you can do it as<br>Bachelor of Science because psychology<br>is a science you can do it as based on<br>social science because psychology is a<br>social science and you can also do it as<br>Bachelor of Arts because psychology is<br>the way of art you know in a way we<br>apply it we have to be creative in<br>applying psychology so what do we do in<br>psychology do research on how we can see<br>movement and object on our perception<br>some of us doing that some trained dogs<br>to sniff out drugs disease or explosives<br>to do diagnostic or to find and<br>differentiate between different drug<br>effects study effects of meditation and<br>mindfulness on health and well-being<br>that is what I am doing help children<br>learn and behave better at school that<br>is what I'm Galica is doing evaluate the<br>impact of programs to reduce family<br>violence couple of people working in<br>that area in our school study the<br>effects of head injuries across<br>populations then consult with companies<br>about employee work-life balance<br>that is also an important point and<br>finally some of us give people alcohol<br>and then study how it effects the<br>driving ability of course on the<br>simulator we have a broad areas where<br>you can study psychology and on this<br>slide you can see only main areas<br>covering neuroscience working with the<br>brain how brain functions that relates<br>to perception of course how we perceive<br>our world then learning and behavior<br>which is the key of evolutionary process<br>cognition our process of thinking<br>development starting from birth until we<br>die what all different stages what's<br>happened in our brain was happen in our<br>body what happened with our certain<br>cognitions and emotions of course<br>emotions are critical because they<br>motivate behavior and we study<br>personality as well so here we have<br>perception here we have behavior<br>learning and here we have cognition and<br>cognition actually affect our emotion as<br>well and we have development and finally<br>personality there are in a practical<br>sense in applied way there are applied<br>areas of psychology industrial<br>psychology of course doing with all<br>involvements in the brain is relational<br>structures India function social<br>psychology dealing with people working<br>groups learning and behavior learning<br>and behavior is a wide topic and it<br>covers of course starting from simple<br>organisms animal behaviors but it is<br>more important for humans behavior<br>health and well-being that is really fun<br>to all of us community psychology<br>indigenous psychology cross-cultural<br>psychology and of course clinical<br>psychology all these areas these are<br>main areas of study in psychology but of<br>course these are not the only areas<br>psychology covers all areas of our life<br>we also have some studies military<br>psychology we look at how people behave<br>in function in different environments in<br>the School of psycho school the School<br>of Psychology provides a foundation in<br>psychology focused on applied way<br>applied means actually that you make<br>psychology useful for us to function<br>adaptively to be healthier to be well<br>and to be happy in the first year when<br>you just start there are two final<br>foundational courses in psychology<br>psychology hundred a in psychology<br>hundred one be the first one is brain<br>behavior in cognition is an introductory<br>class which covers a wide range of<br>topics including research methods and<br>psychology 101 has a focus on social<br>psychology health and well-being these<br>are two major courses you are taking in<br>the first year and the second year you<br>have courses of psychology um and you<br>can see the research methods the Kami on<br>top of the stinging psychological<br>research because research is very<br>important for psychology we want to make<br>sure that what we do in psychology is<br>reliable and valid so we are not<br>speculating it is a science and science<br>needs to provide evidences of everything<br>what we are talking about so you have<br>also a range of other subjects like<br>behavior psychology interception brain<br>and cognition and development and Maori<br>or a social psychology of human<br>flourishing and the third year wider<br>range of topics and papers covered in<br>psychology for example you<br>via crime science crime science doesn't<br>mean that you will be learning how to<br>commit crime so you need to make sure<br>that what we study here is actually<br>study our motivations and behaviors of<br>other people not to become professional<br>or sales then we have infant and child<br>development psychology we have mental<br>health and well-being and memory<br>cognition psychology of measurement with<br>measurement measurement is very<br>important in psychology and in<br>psychology sometimes we measure things<br>you cannot taste you cannot touch you<br>can not see them something like<br>depression or anxiety or happiness<br>quality of life these things are not<br>tangible but they do exist and it is a<br>it is a very complex area which is<br>called psychometric where you need to<br>deal with this phenomenon in a system<br>reliably we have of course we have<br>research methods that is this course is<br>3:07 is a gateway for your graduate<br>study and then we have positive<br>psychology where we learn to be well and<br>happier in all different circumstances<br>of our life and deal with life<br>challenges as well we have behavior<br>analysis which is a bit unreal occur<br>we'll talk about it later<br>which is a very complex and very useful<br>discipline in psychology one of the key<br>areas and then you have organizational<br>psychology and community culture in<br>diversity<br>every year there we try to develop new<br>courses or modify existing courses to be<br>up to date with our development of<br>society and this year for example many<br>of our colleagues started doing research<br>on coronavirus and it's a psychological<br>hit some people in particular if you<br>think about psychology psychology is<br>also useful to improve and enhance your<br>immune system because our immune system<br>apparently in<br>parked at by enduring stress levels and<br>enduring stress levels that is what we<br>have when we have a major health trait<br>something like coronavirus these days<br>and learning psychological mechanisms of<br>stress and dealing with stress we can<br>learn how to improve immune system this<br>research we are doing at the school at<br>the moment as well so and we hope that<br>there would be additional causes later<br>on that will teach you how to improve<br>your immune system using psychological<br>methods so now there are some important<br>terms you need to know this is in a way<br>a dictionary of a student studying at<br>the University we use the word paper<br>paper refers to the course or subject<br>you study for example the foundational<br>course psychology 100 paper line is an<br>information about that paper that<br>contains key events in particular<br>assessments and assessments requirements<br>assessments dates exam date and this is<br>very important that you read it k for<br>them and try to structure your<br>assessments over Adium and be ready to<br>submit them in time convenor refers to<br>to a leader of the paper any of academic<br>staff usually a lecturer who is running<br>a paper and organizing it usually it<br>takes most of the lectures but not<br>necessary we have Co convenors and some<br>papers they are not lecturing a lot but<br>at the spot they are actively in words<br>in the paper lecture is an academic<br>staff member ulka demmick staff members<br>are in our school are also lectures a<br>lecture is a class and traditionally we<br>had classes of 50 minutes or two times<br>50 minutes about two hours class and<br>with several hundred students sometimes<br>but this day this year because of<br>coronavirus we we are not giving public<br>lectures for whether or not giving<br>lectures open lectures for students in a<br>big lecture theatres to reduce risk so<br>what we do we are using recording of the<br>lectures this year we hope that will<br>change in the future and will be able to<br>teach in a large lecture theatres a game<br>la lab refers to a laboratory session or<br>tutorial the difference between lab and<br>tutorial laboratory involves statistical<br>analysis as you can imagine or analyzing<br>data or designing experiments while<br>tutorial is more theoretical but also in<br>working with the small groups usually in<br>tutorial or lab there are about 20<br>students and a live instructor or<br>teaching assistant helping them to<br>progress unfortunately here in semester<br>B we have less coronavirus cases in New<br>Zealand it is considered under control<br>and we we are able to run labs and<br>tutorials with a small groups and also<br>encourage encourage you to obtain those<br>different assistant is somebody who is<br>helping a convener paper can mean to run<br>the paper and this is your first contact<br>in case you need something you can email<br>teaching assistant and ask about way to<br>administration about your assignments<br>ask questions about different procedures<br>how to apply for extinction for example<br>compulsory refers sometimes to<br>assessment we first own those assist<br>means which you cannot skip if you fail<br>compulsory assessment you fail the paper<br>this is what you need to be aware of<br>this is very important for your study<br>now this is how what psychology<br>psychology places what you need to be<br>familiar with psychology reception in<br>the first block on the first floor and a<br>key block this is just around snapshot<br>we have very nice reception<br>in psychology and you are welcome to<br>come there psychology 100 and 101<br>lecture say that is below you can see<br>it's a massive lecture theater it<br>includes you can have 300 people in that<br>lecture theater<br>and we also have our abdomen armed<br>translation to Taronga so lecture<br>typically run simultaneously in Hamilton<br>and in Tauranga not this year<br>unfortunately but we will probably give<br>you opportunity to watch those lectures<br>online so you will get an idea what they<br>are some important websites for you to<br>study Moodle is the main platform you<br>will be using to get your study<br>materials to get information about your<br>study and to communicate with your paper<br>coordinators convenience and teaching<br>assistants the first one this is the<br>link for Moodle then you have student<br>support services student support<br>services developing every year an<br>offering more and more different<br>services these days there is a studios<br>it here which started offering<br>proofreading services which is in<br>particular useful for students coming<br>from overseas who struggle with academic<br>English many of my students using having<br>my graduate students using Studio City<br>to check the papers and to check their<br>work my bike otto is a general website<br>of the university where you can find<br>different types of information then you<br>have a link to timetable which is very<br>important again because you need to know<br>your timetable in for the labs in<br>particular and paper outlines here if<br>you click here you will get your paper<br>line straight away and you can read them<br>and become familiar with me now people<br>you should know start with people and we<br>start with professor Vincent Reed who is<br>our head of the school on top here<br>then we have our distant is clinical<br>neuroscientist and also working in<br>developmental psychology then we have<br>professor John Pyrrhonian with a chair<br>one two undergraduate studies John is<br>working and perception in particular and<br>perception of movement this his main<br>area working in a new science area what<br>we call getting high knowledge then we<br>have professor Samuel Chatham who is<br>also convener for your first course in<br>the first year psychology 103 was doing<br>research on traffic and traffic safety<br>and in particular he is the one who<br>potentially could give an alcohol to<br>participants and then see how they drive<br>him to assist their driving ability of<br>course on the simulator and then we have<br>senior teaching assistant 400 psych 100<br>pipe but Greer quartier so she will be<br>she is very very kind and she will take<br>care of you during your study we have<br>also Kate qualities convener for<br>psychology 101 that you will be taking<br>in the semester be now and Kate will run<br>this paper and introduce you psychology<br>from social perspective and from<br>perspective of health and well-being a<br>very important person for you now me<br>Russell is a school manager now a new<br>school manager and she can help you in<br>many different ways in particular if you<br>can see the graduate study but also<br>moving between courses also taking<br>changing papers changing your<br>administrative settings moving between<br>schools sometimes so please be kind to<br>her and now these people you also need<br>to know because they<br>research methods and psychology and<br>statistics and many students struggle<br>with statistics and research methods but<br>without research methods undistinguished<br>metres properly in measurement and<br>statistics there is no science really<br>science is based on methods and if you<br>apply rigorous methods you will get very<br>robust results you can apply them and<br>help people with issues and problems so<br>me my name is Alec Alec negative so I<br>convene a papers 211 three over seven<br>and five three nine graduate paper<br>together with with Jamie VL and we are<br>people we need to contact in case you to<br>struggle stats and needles then I

analysis such as Graduate<br>Studies then psych 3 1 4 is a<br>prerequisite for all the 500 level<br>papers and behavior analysis so I'd like<br>to briefly introduce the team so<br>teaching 3 1 4 as a team effort and we<br>have wonderful team this year and the<br>senior teacher for psych 3 1 for escape<br>change it's him<br>sorry about that so if you have any<br>general inquiries about the course or<br>needs help<br>he's your first port of call really<br>working with gape and myself are a team<br>of lab instructors so our tutorials are<br>in fact labs because we have a strong<br>practical component to this course and<br>in Hamilton we have one hour billets and<br>km is a is a reach Charlton and in<br>Toronto we are fortunate to have Tina<br>Burke helping us you will meet everybody<br>in the first week and you will have the<br>opportunity to choose your labs so we'll<br>break up the group to work on labs and<br>then any bigger picture questions about<br>the content content or the all the<br>lectures please contact me directly I'm<br>very happy to help and talk to you any<br>time so next slide please<br>sonic yeah you more convenient yeah yeah<br>so I'm gonna talk a little bit in<br>general for I mean some of you will have<br>been studying for semester already some<br>of you might just beginning so we all<br>want you to have a real<br>good time at university and to benefit<br>maximally so I think it's useful to<br>dispel some common myths up for example<br>I think a lot of people when they first<br>start I think oh my goodness everybody<br>else knows what they are doing but I'm<br>the only one who does not not true there<br>will be many people in your situation or<br>you might think oh my goodness the<br>lectures are so scary I can't even ask<br>them to help they'll just think I'm<br>stupid<br>not true there is no such thing as a<br>stupid question for status if you use<br>the discussion so this year everything<br>is going to be different because we<br>won't have lectures in lecture rooms<br>oops<br>so so you can't hand up and ask there<br>but if you use the discussion facilities<br>on Moodle you will find that many people<br>have got if you've got a question<br>chances are there be other people have<br>the same question and Adam is I've got<br>the whole day tomorrow I'll just do a<br>whole assignment then not a good idea at<br>this level at university you will find<br>that most of the Simon's most work will<br>really benefit from you doing a first<br>draft letting it sit there having<br>another goal and and mostly the tasks<br>are too big to just you know all over<br>and do a good job at it and one goal oh<br>well first year doesn't really count<br>anyway also not true I know that there's<br>this other myth going around that CII's<br>get degrees and that actually is true<br>but if you want to proceed to graduate<br>studies in psychology you will not be<br>able to with a C grade generally<br>speaking psychology at the graduate<br>level is quite competitive and you<br>require a B+ at least and most people<br>who do psychology want to eventually<br>become registered psychologists I'll go<br>on with that and you just won't be able<br>to do if you don't get you know pretty<br>good marks having said that if you've<br>done badly on one test maybe fail the<br>test that doesn't mean it's all over<br>most papers have more than one<br>assessment for you to complete and you<br>will have opportunity to make up marks<br>it's just you know keep working<br>you aren't do it if you just cram a few<br>days before the final exam either for<br>starters the course the cause of the<br>papers as their progress build on the<br>knowledge that off the previous lecture<br>and so on and if you don't keep up with<br>your reading and with the coursework you<br>will soon find that you're lost so yes<br>and that take me to the next point yes<br>do read the textbooks it's it's not it's<br>it's not compulsory as such but I come<br>to that in the next slide but you really<br>find that you get much more out of the<br>lectures or out of the teaching if you<br>do all of the reading including all of<br>the assignments so the whole idea is we<br>don't want you to just pass the papers<br>we actually want you to learn all that<br>stuff right and you're not all alone<br>here<br>even though it may seem like a sea of<br>thousand students but there's lots of<br>ways that the university can help you<br>cool so oh you know it's very different<br>to school because yes so we don't make<br>you do things it really is up to you how<br>much you get out of it<br>no one will chase you if you don't go to<br>lectures or labs no one will hunt you<br>down if you don't hand in your<br>assignments so part of the outcome of<br>university study is actually that you'll<br>learn how to learn in a self-directed<br>way and become self-motivated and learn<br>how to organize your time you may<br>sometimes feel that you have a lot of<br>time to spare but actually you don't and<br>the next slide will show you why that is<br>so yeah so for example in a 15 point<br>course like psych 100 you know what that<br>means a 15 point course means that<br>there's probably 4 hours of lectures and<br>1 to 2 hours of lab so that's 12 in 12<br>weeks at 60 hours but that's really not<br>all the time that makes up a 15-point<br>course their remaining 90 hours is the<br>time that you need to spend on studying<br>for any one paper to do a good job so<br>the 90 hours for each paper is the time<br>that you have to somehow<br>organized to get the work done so that<br>means it's about six to eight hours a<br>week that you need to spend on<br>coursework and studying for the exams<br>and doing assignments really really<br>helpful for you to get organized and<br>structure your week so here is what your<br>timetable might look like if you just<br>enter the lecture times right but as I<br>said there's actually lots of other<br>stuff that goes into it and and I'd<br>really like to encourage you to get<br>organized and create this weekly<br>schedule for yourself it'll help you to<br>stay honest stay on task get all the<br>work done it'll also show you that yes<br>it's gonna be a pretty busy trimester so<br>and then a few teaching rest recess<br>great I can have a break and have a<br>holiday or not do anything usually also<br>wrong most the time you'll find that you<br>have lots of things to catch up with and<br>it's where you might be able to give<br>some of your bigger assignments that<br>quality intensive time write exams you<br>know my holidays in the same day as my<br>exam so often people have a clash but<br>the thing is exams we actually not going<br>to have exams at the in in an exam room<br>in the way that they that we used to<br>without the virus and without the kind<br>of Kovac 19 restrictions however exam<br>timetables are fixed and prepared a long<br>time in advance they're not very<br>flexible so it's not going to be easy<br>for anybody to make accommodations for<br>you if you can't make the exam date so<br>as Oleg already mentioned you know a lot<br>of useful information is in the paper<br>outline so I suggest you really read<br>them very carefully and already fix the<br>exam dates any for any key dates in your<br>so of course there are some you know<br>unavoidable situations it can happen<br>that you cannot for very genuine<br>unavoidable reason skip to the exam and<br>special consideration is a possibility<br>for extenuating circumstances on the day<br>of the exam but the reasons for it must<br>be serious and out of your control<br>so not just a common cold or a little<br>paper cut on your finger and if you do<br>need to have a special consideration go<br>and apply online or at the Student<br>Center special consideration also<br>applies to people who have a disability<br>of some kind so special accommodations<br>are available for those of you for whom<br>that applies to there's lots of people<br>at the university that can help you<br>apart from your teaching team and they<br>can help you with the enrollment with<br>degree planning general support anything<br>to do with overseas exchanges assignment<br>submission and collection general<br>information and Trust credits and so on<br>so it's important for you to know where<br>to go for all of this help so you might<br>also want to double check that you are<br>indeed fully enrolled only when you're<br>fully enrolled we have access to<br>everything that you need to have access<br>to really super important that you have<br>access to Moodle for example so if<br>you're not sure go to the Student Center<br>for confirmation of enrollment and for<br>your ID card right so here's some<br>detailed information about enrollment by<br>5:00 p.m. and second Friday of the<br>trimester so two week you have two weeks<br>to change a paper and get a full refund<br>or a transfer or fees to another paper<br>up to that point and the sixth Friday<br>after semester is another kind of a<br>deadline so six week they'd learn to<br>chain<br>papers with no academic penalty and but<br>without a refund or fees so that means<br>if you do change your money you find<br>it's not the paper you've enrolled and<br>it's not really what you're after it's<br>not what you want you can exit the paper<br>there without having a comment on your<br>transcript that you failed now of course<br>if there's compassionate or medical<br>reasons you can withdraw at any time so<br>do come and deception if you need any of<br>that kind of advice right really<br>important stay connected so the main<br>form of communication and it's email<br>make sure that your details are today to<br>make sure that we have your correct<br>email address like us on Facebook<br>so the Faculty of Arts and Social<br>Sciences University of Waikato that's<br>where we are but these days were also<br>called a division but probably people<br>still commonly refer to us as effective<br>arts and social sciences now we have<br>questions I will probably stop sharing<br>the screen because this way we could<br>look at the questions if somebody seen<br>this Eenie<br>I don't see any questions so actually if<br>somebody's interested to ask question<br>you can type them so we can we can<br>answer them but I don't see any ID also<br>I don't see any charts as well yeah so<br>okay then we're supposed to finish at<br>okay thank you very much for<br>participating use webinar and we wish<br>you all good study good study year be<br>housed here happy and safe we look<br>forward to seeing you in class online<br>Moodle wherever however that that<br>happens this year but we look forward to<br>meeting<br>and I think there is one question yeah<br>thank you thank you as well thank you<br>for having in there and yeah same for<br>here and welcome and you might not have<br>questions now
