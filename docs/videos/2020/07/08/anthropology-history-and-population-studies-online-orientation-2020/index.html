Bronwyn Isaacs who is<br>brand new to the Anthropology program<br>just this year Bronwyn researchers in<br>Thailand on the topics of media and<br>politics gender and food she most<br>recently lived in the United States and<br>is currently stuck in Australia due to<br>covert 90 so thank you for joining us<br>and also dr. Adam a doctor who teachers<br>and researchers in the National<br>Institute of demographic and economic<br>analysis here at Wagga<br>Adamo specializes and research and<br>multicultural engagement identity<br>psychological well-being health and much<br>more so today we're going to hear about<br>studying anthropology history and<br>demography in that order and I've had a<br>look at the slaves and they look<br>fantastic so keep your eye out for me<br>and your anthropology and demography<br>classes as we go you can type any<br>questions for us in the chat box and we<br>will come to those questions after we've<br>given three two minutes our<br>presentations so thank you so much<br>Bronwyn next side piece and the next one<br>great hi everyone my name is Bronwyn and<br>I'm glad to be here with you today to<br>talk to you about the wonderful subject<br>of anthropology next slide what I'll be<br>talking about today is firstly what is<br>anthropology secondly why study<br>anthropology thirdly we'll talk a little<br>bit about possible career paths in<br>anthropology and fourthly wrap up a bit<br>about the papers that you can study here<br>oh I got it so next slide firstly what<br>is anthropology if you are confused<br>about what anthropology is don't worry<br>you are not alone I can assure you that<br>there are the<br>students who are also confused and I<br>myself and I've never even heard of<br>anthropology when I went to uni and some<br>people from what they know think that<br>anthropologists of people who dig up<br>dinosaur bones or find old relics<br>someone like Indiana Jones or maybe Tomb<br>Raider and digging up human or animal<br>bones is actually a part of what<br>biological and archaeological<br>anthropologists do but here at Waikato<br>we specialize in social and cultural<br>anthropology that means that we study<br>living people we study society and<br>culture in all of its fantastic<br>diversity we study how people interpret<br>the world around them and how they<br>interact with each other and because we<br>people we study people living today we<br>might be studying people who live in a<br>remote part of the other of another part<br>of the world but we also might be<br>interacting with people on the Internet<br>next slide you will find therefore that<br>anthropologists study global issues they<br>investigate the kinds of problems<br>barriers to human flourishing and they<br>seek to create understanding between<br>people and uncover the reasons behind<br>some of the most critical real world<br>problems you know well today in<br>anthropology we therefore study topics<br>such as racism activism social injustice<br>instructions of disadvantage next slide<br>we also study politics we examine how<br>power operates differently in different<br>cultures and the impact of things like<br>media and technology language and gender<br>on political and social life next slide<br>we also study how people interact with<br>their environments and the effects of<br>environmental change on communities next<br>slide<br>anthropologists also study the way that<br>people pursue health and well-being we<br>also study religion beliefs and all<br>kinds of other habits<br>social practices and the next slide so<br>therefore to pull out an old quote from<br>1932 anthropology is valuable not<br>because it uncovers the archaic but<br>because it is constantly rediscovering<br>the normal so that is while some people<br>might say well culture is always<br>changing so what's the point of studying<br>it anthropologists would say well what<br>we are doing is questioning what people<br>perceive to be normal so if we take<br>these women here who are in this photo<br>as standing at the Yamuna River in India<br>the photo taken in 2019 the women stand<br>praying in what appears to be snow but<br>it is not snow the women are standing in<br>the toxic foam of industrial wastes an<br>anthropologist will ask how did standing<br>in toxic toxic pollution come to be<br>normal to these women what are the<br>structures of disadvantage that lead<br>these women to be death and what kinds<br>of daily activities and daily and<br>Justices do we experience in New Zealand<br>or elsewhere that might be considered<br>normal to us but strange to someone else<br>so next slide so why should you choose<br>to study anthropology do you want to<br>learn about the world in all of its<br>amazing cultural diversity to understand<br>why people are different do you want to<br>question the everyday assumptions we<br>take as normal do you want to learn to<br>think critically about the human factor<br>in the problems facing our well today<br>understanding and answering problems<br>such as environmental change inequality<br>violence and race relations requires<br>people who are attuned to cultural<br>diversity and can facilitate<br>cross-cultural cross-cultural<br>understanding alright next slide so<br>there are various pathways that you can<br>pursue with the skills that you learn in<br>studying anthropology for example<br>non-government organizations such as aid<br>organizations employee anthropology<br>graduates<br>and implement eight programs local<br>community and activist groups also work<br>closely with anthropology graduates<br>consulting anthropology graduates have<br>cross-cultural skills necessary to work<br>for consulting firms or as independent<br>consultants for example working with<br>mining companies who need two layers of<br>local communities in museums heritage<br>and tourism anthropology graduates have<br>skills that are necessary in being able<br>to explain local culture in government<br>research and social services<br>anthropology majors can be hired in<br>roles which require a sophisticated<br>understanding of cultural and social and<br>social diversity business design and<br>market research anthropology majors can<br>design products in why is that more<br>effectively target they can seem a base<br>in documentary film and journalism if<br>you also have film and video skills<br>anthropology students make fantastic<br>documentary makers owing to their<br>training in cultural complexity and<br>anthropology students use their ability<br>to research different people in places<br>for difficult and finally if you combine<br>an anthropology training with other with<br>another degree in areas such as law<br>health or education anthropology makes<br>an excellent base on which to become a<br>more effective and more compassionate<br>in all of these lines of work<br>anthropology can have a positive impact<br>through promoting cultural understanding<br>enter their respect of minority groups<br>and indigenous groups anthropology is<br>therefore a great asset for anyone who<br>wants to understand the world about them<br>and to make a positive change in it next<br>slide at the University of Waikato the<br>faculty the instructors primarily do<br>research in New Zealand the Pacific and<br>Southeast Asia<br>they're far therefore well the papers<br>you take here certainly include case<br>studies for many parts of the world the<br>papers that have a strong Pacific focus<br>next slide there are some examples<br>papers that you could take list on your<br>screen here for example exploring<br>cultures isn't<br>introduction to social social cultural<br>anthropology and comparative study of<br>humans and societies in all their<br>various forms New Zealand and the<br>Pacific offers a chance to look at New<br>Zealand and the Pacific Islands with<br>specific with a special national<br>identities and regional relations<br>ethnicity and identity is a paper that<br>looks at categories of belonging and<br>exclusion in this paper students study<br>racism human migration and concepts of<br>nationalism culture and power in the<br>Pacific is a paper where complex of<br>different systems of political action<br>leadership and ideology in the Pacific<br>Islands of study a Maori heritage<br>management is a paper concerned with a<br>parroting protecting Maori cultural<br>landscape particularly particularly<br>relation to New Zealand legislation the<br>Treaty of Waitangi and issues and issues<br>of we have okay so in conclusion<br>anthropology is a discipline that<br>explores how people around the world<br>live and experience the world around<br>them maybe we'll just move the last<br>slide to if you're interested in<br>studying human cultural diversity and<br>change and understanding the world's<br>biggest issues from the perspective of<br>what people believe is important and how<br>they interact with each other come and<br>study anthropology here with us at<br>Waikato and increase your ability to<br>understand and make a difference in a<br>world filled with cultural diversity<br>what I want to talk about why I care<br>about a stream when we care about<br>history here at university what you will<br>study here and together what we can do<br>with their knowledge so today in<br>everyday I read the newspaper and scroll<br>social media and talk to my family my<br>friends and I'm just overwhelmed by the<br>huge number of conversations that we're<br>having<br>right now about history and Wyatt metas<br>and with that for me comes a whole<br>tumult of emotions so I feel inspiration<br>and hope about the new kind of stories<br>that we're uncovering the conversations<br>we're having and how we're talking about<br>how they can impact our lives today I<br>also feel a lot of sadness and anger the<br>way that some people refuse history and<br>misrepresent it but I think underlying<br>all of that all of those different<br>feelings is one key message that<br>inspires me which is about how much<br>thinking about the past matters to<br>people and as to all of us today and<br>with so many people invested and what<br>happened in the past and how we<br>understand it it's really vital that we<br>learn how to research and critically<br>analyze that and that's what you'll<br>engage in with us yeah so I wanted to<br>show you this image which I think it's<br>really beautiful so in the image we see<br>a statue of Robert Lee who commanded the<br>Army of Northern Virginia from 1862<br>after Virginia left the United States<br>and fought a civil war to continue the<br>enslavement of black people this is 130<br>year old stare show it stand 16 feet<br>high and Lee Square Richmond and as<br>historical imagery has been transformed<br>since George Floyd was killed by<br>Minneapolis Police on the 25th of May<br>since then as you can see protestors<br>have tagged the statues enormous base<br>with an array of graffiti including the<br>protest messages of stop killing us and<br>defund the police and paint canisters a<br>lift for others to use so that the<br>messages change every day and at night<br>the artist Dustin Klein projects images<br>of historical figures and of George<br>Floyd as you can see in this image on<br>the surface of the monument outrage over<br>the killing of George Floyd peasants by<br>passionate debates about the histories<br>of policing and white supremacy and<br>police violence and<br>United States as well as the<br>significance of statues and street names<br>that honor Confederate figures like this<br>one here and it's a set of connected<br>discussions happening here in New<br>Zealand about science and the New<br>Zealand Wars which spans nearly 30 years<br>from 1845 to 1872 ranging from the bay<br>of islands and the north to wire out<br>near Blenheim in the South was plenty of<br>violence in Waikato and Taranaki and<br>there are plenty of connections to what<br>has happened and is happening in the<br>u.s. the New Zealand Police for example<br>originated in the armed Constabulary who<br>fought for the crown during the New<br>Zealand waters and the statue of John<br>Hamilton Hamilton's namesake was removed<br>from civic square here in Hamilton last<br>month and Hamilton died at gate pyre and<br>Tonga in 1864 during the New Zealand<br>warmest so here in New Zealand we have<br>few signs to mark the sites where<br>battles occurred we do not always teach<br>students in school what has happened<br>here this is changing thanks to the<br>leadership of former students at Otto<br>hummus College in the King country shop<br>to learn in 2014 at massacres had taken<br>place only a half hours drive from their<br>homes Lee Belle and why Madame a<br>Anderson petitioned Parliament for a day<br>of commemoration for the New Zealand<br>Wars and for New Zealand history to be<br>taught in schools 13,000 people signed a<br>petition and in 2016 the government<br>announced the introduction of the<br>national day of commemoration on the<br>28th of October and New Zealand history<br>is going to be taught in the school<br>curriculum from 2022 so all of that<br>really speaks to me about why history<br>matters to people weight matters to us<br>as academics and students and where<br>matters and all the kinds of things<br>you're going to go out and do in the<br>world and those are for the broad<br>reasons and that I've put on the slide<br>here so about the way that our society<br>is organized about specific laws and<br>policies but also it's about what we<br>identify with how we<br>and our stories personal and family and<br>as a country so studying history with us<br>makes you excellent<br>organizers analysts writers teachers and<br>researchers you gain key skills for a<br>variety of jobs for example in<br>policymaking for local councils and<br>national government and an advocacy for<br>community organizations and of course<br>you develop a deep understanding of<br>history and heritage that is vital to<br>the work of museums galleries teachers<br>and diplomats so many of our students<br>take up teaching like we've seen in<br>Nicholas and I'll allow that pen woman<br>who have taught locally here for some<br>time now and some of you may be their<br>students many of our undergraduates find<br>work and local and national governing<br>departments because of their writing and<br>research skills so we have our<br>historians working for corrections New<br>Zealand statistics New Zealand and the<br>office of treaty settlements others like<br>Christopher Burke and Ellie closely have<br>worked with the Waitangi tribunal our<br>graduates work in museums as curators<br>because of the high calibre of their<br>writing and research skills that often<br>employed as writers and researchers for<br>example a news media outlets and local<br>and regional councils their expertise<br>and historical subjects and their<br>ability to critically analyse and<br>construct arguments as vital to their<br>work and I would argue to our shared<br>future so I've got up here the history<br>papers that are on offer this year so<br>you can see what you study in your first<br>second or third yeah and just to talk<br>about what brings together these various<br>topics for us and so here at Waikato we<br>are committed to teaching history that<br>uncovers untold stories and it shapes<br>our lives here in altero and New Zealand<br>for us that means teaching topics like<br>indigenous history Maori history Pacific<br>history gender history oral history<br>global history and history of the United<br>States and you can see those<br>things across the papers that we offer<br>we teach students how to do mystery how<br>to find and interpret evidence and how<br>to understand it and this these are<br>papers in twenty twenty one so you can<br>see the continuity of topics also we<br>have extra two additional papers in<br>United States history that you can take<br>in that year so here are our staff and<br>moving from the bottom left of the<br>screen I'll introduce them to you so dr.<br>Raymond Richards is writing a biography<br>of New Zealand politicians to Roger<br>Douglas and he teaches United States<br>history and they're moving to the top<br>Libya math weekend is working on a<br>history of marketing in Algeria and he's<br>part of the working group involved in<br>writing the New Zealand history<br>curriculum research for 2022<br>he teaches New Zealand history modern<br>history and historical theory and in the<br>middle there dr. Kate Stevens and her<br>current projects include research on<br>histories of coconuts as commodities of<br>smell from the Pacific to Europe and of<br>the city of silver and here she teaches<br>the civic history oceanic history and<br>the history of food and finally myself<br>Charlotte greenhouse I'm currently<br>researching in history of pregnancy and<br>twentieth century New Zealand and I<br>teach in gender history and historical<br>methods so together we really aim to<br>teach history that's relevant to<br>students here at the University of<br>Waikato and to contribute to the relief<br>vital discussions that are going on all<br>around us in 2020 and we all look<br>forward to meeting you and working with<br>you in class thank you<br>oh do you Adam a parrot in money a<br>plethora no taranaki hooky cardamom for<br>cooing what I was hoping this might be a<br>little bit interactive so can I get a<br>Kyoto on the chat anybody it's you from<br>I'll just say Kyoto and my chat to<br>everybody and I get anything back from<br>anyone oh thanks from me when viewing at<br>home wanna cinder emoji Oh cute Amy<br>thanks for that you one want to send an<br>emoji they'd be pretty cool just a chick<br>that you're really out there oh I'll<br>kill the Louise so I'm on leave at the<br>moment Gilda Gilda Holly I'm actually<br>sitting outside and tarney Ottawa as you<br>can see here and like a little she'd sit<br>up we've got an outdoor fireplace here<br>got a couple of semi tamed here all<br>kittens become part of the fauna here<br>over the lockdown period so this as<br>though they're on spending my leave and<br>we're just here planning the revolution<br>basically oh what's this is this a<br>little chic or something from Jackson<br>I've got on watch it so yeah it's lovely<br>to connect with you all online I know<br>this is probably not the experience you<br>thought you'd be having an orientation<br>having to sit at home wherever you are<br>and whatever fine part of a little or<br>around the world that you may be but<br>it's lovely to at least be able to<br>connect with you online if not in person<br>thank you to Charlotte and Bronwyn and<br>for the corridor that you presented<br>about history and anthropology I'm<br>pretty tempted to start a degree all<br>over again just so I can spend on those<br>papers and what beautiful images so I'm<br>part of Nydia the National Institute of<br>demographic and economic analysis that's<br>quite a mouthful but we are the only<br>Institute that's focused on on<br>demography and population studies in the<br>country which means they're we're very<br>specialized so we're primarily a<br>Research Institute first all of the<br>schools and the university are research<br>active of course all of our lecturers do<br>lots of their own really<br>in research but Liddy is a little bit<br>unique just in that we're primarily a<br>Research Institute so that's our main<br>it's our core business our<br>bread-and-butter<br>funded largely through external research<br>grants that we get but we also teach<br>because we understand that in order for<br>the Institute to have demographers we<br>need to produce our own demographers but<br>what that means is that because that<br>what we teach is so specialized it gives<br>our students a really specific in<br>actually rare lens that they can bring<br>to a lot of problems that we face in the<br>world and of course we probably center<br>of a lot of people's thinking at the<br>moment is probably clover 19 you know<br>you may have questions like why has this<br>pandemic affected countries that we<br>might have thought we would be most<br>resilient to this type of disease so<br>like Western developed countries for<br>example I mean there are lots of factors<br>that play into there and in through<br>having a lens that you that you develop<br>through studying population studies and<br>demography we were able to answer some<br>of those questions and ways that you<br>know reading the newspaper and talking<br>to your friends just will not give you<br>so it so it's a really specific and<br>important and crucial skill to hear yeah<br>so there are so many challenges that we<br>face is as humans that demography gives<br>us the tools to be able to address so<br>we've talked about covert but also some<br>things like climate change so the impact<br>of human populations on on the climate<br>issues like displacements of people<br>refugees these types of things because<br>the kind of bread-and-butter topics<br>within demography are births deaths and<br>migration so we spend a lot of time<br>thinking about what's really cool as<br>well about population studies is that<br>the degree is extremely flexible so<br>whatever you might be studying you may<br>be very keen to enroll or Bronwen and<br>with charlotte you can fit in a<br>demography degree as well really easily<br>with those<br>do you want to say kill this to the<br>students we've got lots of people want<br>to say killed it to the students so<br>whatever you might be studying or we've<br>just been learning so much from this<br>mean this morning something was<br>overflowing<br>around how we can share power in this<br>country but back to the code up of<br>population studies we have a very<br>flexible degree structure so we we don't<br>actually have first-year courses we<br>don't stick in here with the with the<br>introduction to population so these<br>course which I teach so in their course<br>you get all your foundations that you<br>need and then you only have taken<br>another couple of papers in the 300<br>level to be able to add population<br>studies that really attractive skill set<br>they kind of sets you apart from other<br>people when you you know leaving uni and<br>then looking for money yes a bit so<br>that's us that sound flexible degree<br>structure I'll next slide please I'm<br>like pushing the button trying to make<br>this like okay so population studies<br>this instead of yeah going to broad I<br>thought we'd actually get down to the<br>nuts and bolts of what keeps them<br>ographers up at night so this is where I<br>need a little bit of interaction from<br>you all as well so what do you think are<br>some of the biggest population<br>challenges that we face and I've put a<br>few examples here so do you think that a<br>big problem that we face is that there<br>are too many babies being born or that<br>there are not enough babies being born<br>or that people are not living long<br>enough or that people are living too<br>long so if you're willing to take a stab<br>at which one of those things you think<br>is the biggest issue then please and put<br>it on the chat we've got any takers<br>anyone would like to guess which one of<br>people living too long oh thank you Amy<br>yeah that's a that's a really that shows<br>some real critical thinking that you're<br>able to think about that and frame that<br>as a problem so please and row Amy would<br>love to have you and population studies<br>running out of resources yeah yeah and<br>it one's probably quite closely tied<br>maybe with people living too long maybe<br>with there being too many babies born as<br>well but of course the bigger issue<br>there isn't is not people sometimes<br>frame it like this the problem is not<br>conception its consumption isn't it so<br>it's more about how resources are shared<br>amongst the people as opposed to how<br>many people there are because there are<br>there is a kind of a small group of<br>developed nations that are kind of<br>consuming a lot so you know consuming a<br>lot of resources so so the reason I've<br>got this image here of course if you've<br>watched any of these American propaganda<br>movies is there you know this character<br>fairness he clicks his finger to<br>eliminate half of the population<br>randomly because he believes they're<br>just too many people in you know the<br>universal whatever is running out of<br>resources so he's obviously hasn't<br>studied pops 201 because he thinks that<br>the issue is just that the s too many<br>babies being born so I'm gonna go<br>through now each of these Christians to<br>see is this really a problem that we<br>should be thinking about so next slide<br>please<br>too many babies born is this a problem<br>well this is just a really little graph<br>that is probably a warning I should put<br>out there with pops<br>201 is that we do look at lots of graphs<br>but it's actually a good language to be<br>able to speak if you're able to<br>interpret graphs it's very beneficial<br>for a lot of different jobs that you<br>might go into but if we look at this<br>graph we can see just massive massive<br>population growth in a really really<br>short period of human history and this<br>this graph doesn't really even do that<br>justice for so so long in our human<br>history there's barely any change to<br>population but just basically since the<br>Industrial Revolution we just had<br>massive increasing and a number of<br>people making people suggest that<br>running out of resources is a really<br>really huge challenge we should be<br>concerned a and we can also see that the<br>growth is is not uniform across the<br>world certain regions of the world have<br>contributed more to growth at different<br>times and it's all related to where they<br>are in their demographic transition<br>which you'll learn all about if you<br>enroll in pops 201 so we can see that in<br>the last hundred years or so it's been a<br>sure where a lot of the population<br>growth has occurred but for the next<br>hundred years you'll learn it will<br>actually be driven largely by Africa the<br>population growth next slide<br>so the next question and not enough<br>babies being born is that a problem<br>well yes it is a problem so with<br>although we've had a lot of population<br>growth in the last hundred years the<br>actual growth rate is going down so all<br>around the world in every region of the<br>world fertility the number of babies<br>that the every woman will have is<br>dropping and dropping rapidly so even in<br>the least developed country so that red<br>line at the top there even there we see<br>the number of babies being born reducing<br>and the numbers are kind of converging<br>around replacement fertility so there in<br>the next by 2050 so that's only thirty<br>years away population growth will have<br>stopped which is pretty mind-blowing<br>because I think we all kind of assume if<br>we haven't done population studies that<br>growth will never stop there you know<br>how we're gonna slow population growth<br>down that this is a huge issue it's<br>really not going to be a huge issue in<br>the future and in fact in places and and<br>the more developed regions of the world<br>like places like New Zealand we're going<br>to be struggling to try and replace<br>replace our young people so so yeah if<br>you're if you are thinking that you<br>maybe need to limit your fertility but a<br>second's the planet yeah it's good to to<br>balance that with this type of<br>information okay next slide what's our<br>next population challenge people not<br>living long enough so now people you<br>know people's<br>life expectancy has increased a lot in<br>recent decades but if we look at certain<br>groups of the population we can see that<br>it's it's not necessarily even there's a<br>lot of inequity with how long people are<br>living so we'll cover a bit of that here<br>we've got for the context of New Zealand<br>we've got Maori males<br>martí females non Marty males in<br>Normandy females and we see that there<br>are a gender differences there or six<br>differences and there are also<br>differences based on ethnicity and we go<br>into what are some of the reasons for<br>their next slide<br>people living too long so is this a<br>problem well we like people to live a<br>long time of course but it coupled with<br>the decrease in fertility it's leading<br>to a really interesting set of changes<br>in our world so we see from the 1950s<br>this is a population pyramid we talk<br>about this type of data visualization as<br>a pair as a pyramid because they used<br>you know we used to them looking like<br>this where we have males and females on<br>each side and ages going up and it tends<br>to be lots of babies and then fewer and<br>fewer fewer people is people get older<br>but as we see a fewer babies being born<br>in people tending to live longer we're<br>seeing that's no longer a pyramid<br>anymore<br>we have 2015 population this is a data<br>from Japan I believe where it's no<br>longer a pyramid at all it's more of a<br>sausage and then it's almost like an<br>upside down triangle will the projected<br>figures by 2050 so if you can think of<br>the way in which if you were say if<br>you're wanting to go into the government<br>to be a politician or if you wanting to<br>go into an NGO or if you're wanting to<br>go into local council or something like<br>that having an understanding about how<br>the population is changing how the<br>structure of the population is changing<br>how the different needs of your<br>community will change over time you know<br>do we need to start tuning schools into<br>retirement villages do we need to think<br>about the different types of<br>superannuation that are available for<br>people how do we afford to take care of<br>our growing aging population<br>when there are fewer and fewer people<br>entering the workforce for us to gain<br>taxation from so these are all really<br>really significant challenges that we<br>face all of these four so when I asked<br>you to choose one of those issues that<br>keep demographers up at night you could<br>not have gone wrong they're all things<br>that we're concerned about even though<br>it seems paradoxical that all of those<br>things can can be concerns so by the way<br>that your balance says I see that you<br>already know a little bit about<br>population studies but there are<br>probably some some things that might<br>have they might have been things that I<br>talked about today that you hadn't<br>thought about before and it's what I<br>find really interesting about population<br>studies it provides you these tools<br>particularly around how to project into<br>the future and what populations will<br>look like that really just give you a<br>lens that it's really critical next<br>slide please<br>right so I knew that the others were<br>going to be talking about the different<br>careers that you can go into with<br>history and anthropology degrees so so I<br>didn't want to label this too much but<br>you can go on to all of those jobs as<br>well there's population studies but with<br>this that's really essential crucial<br>lens that helps you<br>yeah just provide interesting<br>perspective that others just don't get<br>in a range of different areas and it's<br>been interesting for me since I've been<br>in this space just the invitations that<br>I get to speak on so many different<br>Koper because the way that the<br>population is changing just affects<br>everything so you know I've been invited<br>to give keynote talks at sports and<br>recreation conferences for example you<br>know I I contribute a lot to the<br>discussion about immigration and what<br>what we should what our immigration<br>system should look like one of the<br>values that it should be based on how<br>can we eliminate racial discrimination<br>from the way that we set up our system<br>and in later than this year have been<br>invited to I'm like talking about this<br>because I'm so shocked and surprised<br>myself but it's just the invitations you<br>get when you're a population studies X<br>like me but I'll be speaking to a group<br>of 30 to 40 judges who want to learn<br>about how diversity is changing in<br>Algeria and in what they need to know as<br>judges to be able to understand the<br>communities we you know in which they're<br>making these really important decisions<br>so it is a lens that just really helps<br>you in a range of different areas so<br>whatever you're studying whatever<br>particularly for doing some social<br>science degree then studying this<br>alongside whatever you're doing would<br>just could be their age so I do hope to<br>see see you even though I can't see you<br>now I hope to see you in my population<br>studies class next year I think it's<br>it's me done we would love to take your<br>questions so please it's just myself<br>Bronwyn Adama or just generally please<br>type them into your chat boxes and we<br>can we can address those or you can just<br>tell us what you're thinking about<br>studying what you're looking forward to<br>this year we'd love to hear your that<br>too<br>is anyone is anyone gonna enroll for any<br>of these schools if you're gonna enroll<br>for anthropology type anthropology<br>you're gonna enroll for history time<br>history could be a competition for us<br>3:8 it will just give you a couple of<br>minutes to think but um I don't I can I<br>just ask you something about um about<br>this grass is grass<br>so 80-plus is a category in the in the<br>in the graphs it's different to the<br>others why do you think a B+ has been<br>decided on is it okay and how does it if<br>you if that was arranged differently how<br>would it change our reading of those<br>images yeah so there is kind of really<br>arbitrarily decided and it tends to be<br>decided because he just does not many<br>people left in that category that's<br>changing you know yeah this I wonder<br>what the 2050 graph would look like if<br>it carried on in five year increments<br>for a while yeah there is this seems to<br>be like a bit of a natural limit on cuz<br>you know longevity is increasing over<br>time with you you know we are biological<br>organisms we don't actually think that<br>it can continue forever to an increase<br>and increase in increase so a lot<br>there's there's two really important<br>ways in which the the shape of this<br>changes one is numeric aging so that's<br>just the number of people who are living<br>longer and there is driven by these<br>changes in longevity so just people are<br>surviving and so more people are<br>entering into those older age groups but<br>the other is structural aging and it's<br>driven by people not having babies so<br>and when we look at this graph it's<br>based on percentages so both of those<br>things are contributing to the size of<br>those larger categories and<br>the part of the reason why there are so<br>many people in the 80 plus is because<br>it's a percentage and there are so few<br>at the at the bottom of background it<br>makes any sense<br>yes at the numeric aging just more older<br>people that's driven by people surviving<br>longer because of improvements and<br>medicine and that type of thing<br>structural aging is the larger share of<br>the population who are older relative to<br>younger people and that's driven by<br>decreases and futility I am one of my<br>projects is on the history of Aging in<br>20th century so I I feel like I could<br>talk to you about this for a long time<br>but I won't take everybody's day when I<br>was looking at the stuff that you guys<br>were presenting as well just like look<br>there's a lot of overlaps with the work<br>that that we do as well so it's really<br>exciting and my colleague Tohu cooker<br>toy she's actually trained in history as<br>well yeah and she gives a guest lecture<br>in our circle methods and tells us all<br>about the kind of historical<br>construction of the census yes and the<br>implications are there wonderful stuff I<br>think perhaps we should read but please<br>feel free I'm sure to get in contact<br>with any one of us and you'll find out<br>details on the University website and we<br>wish you all the very best with the year<br>and selecting among these great options<br>thank you
