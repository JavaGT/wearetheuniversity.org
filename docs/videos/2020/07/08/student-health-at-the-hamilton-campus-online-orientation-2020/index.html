support governor student health we<br>tend to think of ourselves within the<br>framework created by Professor mesentery<br>it's if I need to file<br>it's fine if I really looks at your body<br>is being like a fight it's grounded the<br>Finn wah<br>you have your roots on land and from<br>there you start creating your identity<br>and it forms from one slide which is<br>your family your social relationships<br>your friends and with there comes your<br>feelings emotions wellness then you<br>connect to a data tool in all of this of<br>course is channeling through your body<br>and you're engaging with the world the<br>new would be learning and finding out in<br>a mystical back as well of course<br>overarching over there is your sense of<br>connectedness and we think about this in<br>terms of submergible so that's how we<br>think of you against it and student how<br>I've got a really diversity of people<br>and one of the roles that we have we<br>occupy all of those dimensions but we<br>have a particular focuses so it's<br>unhealthy<br>we took health incidents making Courtney<br>we have chaplaincy and a chapel<br>supported my brother entry father I<br>would have it in practice and we have a<br>baby Imogen practising in church on this<br>talk about that today we have a violence<br>prevention coordinate of treatment with<br>counselors like Michelle Chris and then<br>we have made tough on a novena and I'm<br>the health promotions we're pretty easy<br>to find my cattle if you ever go to the<br>main car park we're running like this so<br>we kind of rider between the main car<br>park the lake unis reek<br>so I'll Park Yoda my name is Thomas and<br>I'm going to talk to you about Beijing<br>next clinic the general practice offers<br>all services that you would expect<br>family but it's only for students<br>currently enrolled with the University<br>of Waikato we have four general<br>practitioners or doctors in a nurse<br>practitioner our practice nurses a table<br>and to give you lots of services such as<br>AC c XC means going to here and they can<br>also give you treatments for common<br>conditions such as comedy and urine<br>infections and we have no prescribers<br>and they're able to prescribe medicines<br>for the common conditions such as asthma<br>and contraception and you're welcome to<br>okay request then there's prescriber<br>when you ring out we also have same-day<br>appointments for urgent health needs so<br>that if you think you need to be seen<br>sooner than the next routine appointment<br>please phone and ask for a nurse to<br>triage your condition and then you might<br>be able to get seen on that day so we<br>encourage you to enroll with Student<br>Health Service the general practice<br>clinic and that means their student<br>house will become your primary care<br>provider and you won't be enrolled with<br>your other doctor to do this you need to<br>fill in enrollment form online or at the<br>clinic reception being enrolled means<br>that the clinic fees reduced and there<br>are some free clinic services but even<br>if you do not enroll you can still use<br>all the services it's you in health so<br>the face for enrolled patients it's $10<br>to see a doctor or nurse and if you do<br>not enroll then it's more expensive<br>however I encourage everyone to get a<br>community service card because it means<br>that if you don't enroll that's cheaper<br>but also it's cheaper other medical<br>centers if you need help here please<br>note that our appointments are only 15<br>minutes so that we can only deal with<br>one concern her appointment if he had<br>multiple issues or you have a new name<br>to talking soon please request a busy<br>we have a number of free clinic services<br>for enrolled patients including sexual<br>health chicks and we also have fast<br>sexual health tips so this means you can<br>do your own test you don't need to see a<br>doctor or nurse you simply go to<br>reception and say that you want to do a<br>fast check and then you're about to<br>doing and remember that even if you do<br>not been involved with the clinic you<br>can still use the other services such as<br>half counseling for free we are also<br>offering telehealth appointments so this<br>is suitable for a doctor or nurse<br>appointments when the physical cheek is<br>not needed and

Spicer you can house there's<br>actually two of us so there's myself and<br>our colleague night both nation I have<br>experience over the last six years<br>working in adult mental health and child<br>never listen usual health and so those<br>things that we're well except to support<br>students from any music athletes so the<br>service is free for all students both<br>international and domestic and we're<br>able to provide students based here on<br>my Potomac also ever entered on we<br>provide short term support as well that<br>looks different page individual and that<br>will just depend on what your needs up<br>we're able to help with new mental<br>health concerns or existing mental<br>health conditions and so those might<br>look like changes and thoughts mode<br>emotions and behavior or what look like<br>depression anxiety mood disorders<br>disordered eating substance abuse and<br>addictions and anything else that falls<br>on there we provide a safe space that's<br>confidential free of judgment to have a<br>chair and basically your first<br>appointment would look like coming in<br>talking other native myself telling us<br>what's brought you and what your<br>concerns are and letting us know what<br>you're experiencing and from there we'll<br>work with you quite holistically to see<br>what's impacting your mental health and<br>look at different options and helping<br>you to improve your well-being and how<br>to keep safe and successful in your<br>academic journey so we look at all<br>strategies advice different talking<br>therapies<br>guidance about treatment severe that<br>might be medication or not medication we<br>can work really closely with other<br>providers within student health or also<br>external providers and your GPS<br>yeah basically whatever that looks like<br>we'll just work alongside you to the<br>best outcomes and there's a few<br>different equipment types so we have<br>routine appointments so you can put<br>those in advance that it's the first<br>time we're meeting you it's usually one<br>hour and following that would be thirty<br>minutes we also have same-day<br>appointments every day from 1:00 to 3:30<br>and we also have the ability to provide<br>urgent or crisis support online if you<br>go to that link there is a whole heap of<br>drop-down boxes but all different<br>resources tools self-help tools all the<br>different help lines and some different<br>phone applications so I recommend that<br>you check that out and have a look and<br>there's also more information about the<br>service that we provide so thank you and<br>I'll hand over to my colleague Kelly got<br>it<br>my name is Kelly Redmond and it's<br>prevention coordinator on the Hamilton<br>campus so my role is typically around<br>education and training so normally that<br>looks like training the staff and<br>education for students and you'll see on<br>the slide here that we have a link to<br>consent matters this is a modular on<br>sexual consent we're aware that not a<br>lot of students have sexual consent<br>education in high school so if you're<br>keen to learn a little bit more then<br>please go to that link you can also<br>learn a bit about bystander intervention<br>through this initiative so if you don't<br>think that it's a sexual consent element<br>that you wanted to learn about but you'd<br>like to go to help someone out if you<br>noticed a bit of a dodgy situation then<br>that's a great place to go and learn<br>some of those skills so where to find<br>that is in Moodle now Moodle is going to<br>be your portal to find all of your<br>papers so you'll go in to find papers<br>which you can see in one of the images<br>on screen there your search papers just<br>put consent medicines in there then you<br>can add that in your paper selection so<br>the paper is completely free and<br>unfortunately not all your pens agreed<br>so download it and have a look so<br>another way that I support people not<br>just education and training but if<br>there's actually an issue that you want<br>to discuss then you can contact me<br>through the violence prevention Network<br>at or ACON send email address you can<br>see at the bottom of the screen there so<br>some of the support that I can do for<br>students or for staff is actually just<br>having a listen about what the concern<br>is so most of the concerns that I deal<br>with are around sexual harm or family<br>violence so coming to me and having that<br>conversation is completely confidential<br>it doesn't mean that I'm going to<br>contact any other services and I'm going<br>to be contacting the police or Women's<br>Refuge or anything like that we can just<br>have a conversation then if you did want<br>to actually access some of those other<br>community services then I can help you<br>do their time through that service<br>navigation aspect of their service so<br>sometimes that you may also require some<br>safety planning and again if whatever<br>reason you don't want to access some<br>community services and we can actually<br>do that together so please take a photo<br>of the screen so you have some of those<br>details on there and get in touch if you<br>want to have discussion about any of<br>those things that I've discussed here<br>and use thanks Kari<br>Jericho - and welcome to the chaplaincy<br>service at leaving this little white<br>button i'm brother Andrew and my<br>colleague here is father gay beach<br>bedroom and we are the two champions<br>here at white heaven in case you don't<br>know the captain is usually a religious<br>professional who cares the spiritual and<br>ethical need to an institution in our<br>case the Stanton

university is here to take care of<br>your mind also of your health but no<br>less than that of your soul we just feel<br>it probably you have maybe you have a<br>religious tradition here explore other<br>traditions or to go deeper into your own<br>religious tradition as further<br>understand you will find master priests<br>as well but you will find also it space<br>sometimes University can be a bit<br>overwhelming it's like going into a<br>library and knowing the answers you need<br>are in there somewhere but you can't<br>find the catalog you don't know where to<br>look other times that's not going on in<br>your life and you want someone to talk<br>to someone who won't scold you but who<br>can listen with compassion you probably<br>already have the answer within you but<br>it's not accessible until you can voice<br>your fears or doubts and then you can<br>also speak your own truth sometimes you<br>will need the specialist services of our<br>counselors or mental health nurses but<br>other times you just need a friendly<br>here come on talk to us because you will<br>understand that the university needs a<br>place where you are growing growing not<br>only your mind but only
