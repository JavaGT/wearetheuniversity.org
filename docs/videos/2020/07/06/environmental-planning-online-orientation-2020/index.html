hello everyone I'm in white I'm<br>professor environmental planning and<br>welcome to the orientation webinar for<br>2020 the University of Waikato and we've<br>got about 15 minutes today so what I'm<br>going to run through is what is<br>environmental planning so again I don't<br>when it's the kind of program which<br>could be for you I mean the link to how<br>its structured and some of the careers<br>and be simply given as well so I'll take<br>about 15 minutes if you got any<br>questions put them in the chat box and<br>we'll pick them up at the end okay so<br>the fun with this basically we've made a<br>lot of mistakes in how we allocate<br>London resources and how we decide who<br>gets what<br>why I'm wearing us essentially what<br>Huberman are playing tries to influence<br>so we've got a climate crisis it's<br>particularly pronounced in New Zealand<br>because quite a long coastline a lot of<br>our people live by the coast and there's<br>a lot of risk that will escalate in the<br>future so how do we deal with that if<br>you look at a graph on the top left it<br>gives you a depth the time and some of<br>the issues about having to deal with so<br>thinking about your life span does that<br>red mark is the range of future<br>possibilities of future climates we know<br>is increasing but we don't know how but<br>it's gonna go so depends what we do in<br>the interim and that's about the use of<br>London resources too and the laws that<br>we have in case Oh<br>planet is essentially it concerned with<br>climate change and the climate crisis<br>how we transition our economy and and<br>how we live to a different state so this<br>is a video of some research with there<br>and this is the Bay of Plenty and this<br>gives you an idea of some of the<br>historical decisions we've got to make<br>better so this is a coastline its drone<br>footage from some research we're looking<br>at shoreline retreat and you look at<br>those houses they really shouldn't be<br>there they're not gonna be there at<br>about 10:15<br>20 years but we also build in a lot of<br>houses at the same time so one of the<br>things we have to think about is what's<br>fair<br>when do we retreat from the coast as<br>well as how we do it and do we<br>compensate do we do land swaps so<br>there's a whole lot of questions we just<br>haven't resolved in New Zealand and<br>that's one of the things that we look at<br>but like Qatar<br>what about research areas the same time<br>we've got a housing crisis so we've got<br>pretty much the most unaffordable<br>housing in the entire world and that<br>means that your generation have been<br>really not represented in<br>decision-making it's not fair and it<br>shouldn't be that way it's probably<br>around the financialization of housing<br>has become an asset class and it's also<br>about the volume and the numbers and the<br>types of houses were built to so that's<br>another thing that planners do we work<br>out the kinds of houses beneath where<br>the different demographics of varna<br>structures we try and meet those so<br>you've got a housing crisis as well as a<br>climate crisis and there's other issues<br>around transport that we deal with and<br>social justice indigenous land rights<br>water rights all those issues that<br>relate to the use of London resources us<br>what we do so this program will<br>basically give you their skills to<br>navigate and New Zealand's also grow in<br>quite rapidly so this is just the<br>example of all of them so if you look at<br>the red box that's going to be the extra<br>dwellings so five twenty eighteen to<br>twenty forty eight so about thirty years<br>this is a dict and amount of houses you<br>do not buy a number of ways by<br>population growth but it also changes in<br>household formation you work out what<br>kinds of houses you need where and then<br>you link it up to other aspects like<br>transport - so in simple terms one in<br>there one in three homes that exist in<br>30 years have a big bill so if we can<br>influence them to be more sustainable or<br>to link to public transport better<br>because you make quite a big influence<br>on the sustainability of New Zealand we<br>can make things like train<br>more viable what reasons when we don't<br>have trains and these are not many<br>trains is because we've got to sprawl<br>our urban form design of people living<br>within a footprint of walking distance<br>to the train station so it doesn't pay<br>for itself economic but if we grow in a<br>right way we also mean for the transport<br>vehicle so this is some of the broad<br>context that we will learn if you do any<br>violent opponent degree so they talk<br>about Waikato is it's very<br>interdisciplinary a good way to think<br>about is if you call it drama-free<br>politics are you actually concerned with<br>trying to make things better if you're<br>looking for a moment if you were going<br>to volume or worth it's a good subject<br>for you because we do influence practice<br>we don't just talk about things we do<br>change policies with many new laws and<br>we try and improve they call air life<br>for people not even born yet so every<br>Park you enjoy a good public space you<br>enjoy has been for over perhaps even<br>before you were born by a planner and so<br>one of the things we do is create a lot<br>of intergenerational equity as well so<br>if you're interested in those broad<br>subject areas that's what puniness<br>entually links to and it provides you<br>with the skills and resources in order<br>to be a planner if you're thinking<br>whether it's for you if you're<br>interested in things like sim city or<br>the city building programs or even for a<br>strong sense of social justice thing you<br>want to improve things this could be the<br>kind of degree program for you so in<br>simple terms we have a lot of land we<br>have a lot of resources we have impacts<br>on air on water quality<br>we've gotta represent biodiversity and<br>one of my friend things that don't grow<br>and someone's gonna make those calls<br>around what we should do and that's this<br>girl's will give you so it's like how<br>I'm where I should cities grow how do we<br>balance that with the needs of transport<br>and business and growth and how do we<br>grow in a more sustainable way cinema<br>moment is a<br>for about orphans water resources which<br>is just ridiculous there's no reason why<br>anyone in New Zealand should have any<br>water resources whatsoever it was a<br>mismanagement book we'll get to that<br>because I think about demand-side issues<br>about how we can use less water more<br>technology for change more recycling of<br>water and reducing our demand rather<br>than just increasing the supply so<br>someone's gotta make those decisions and<br>someone's going to write the laws and<br>the policy that is followed by<br>developers and that says that's planets<br>so we do a bunch of environmental<br>planning a big painting this is a<br>professional degree so it's similar to<br>accountancy or even veterinary sciences<br>if you do this degree you become a pro<br>no it's not a genomic degree where<br>you're not quite sure where you'll end<br>up it's accredited by the New Zealand<br>planners issue and there's only a<br>handful of places around New Zealand<br>where that's the case so you can't<br>actually get employment as a plan unless<br>you doing a creative degree which is<br>what we do here and we provide the<br>skills for a career environment or<br>planning there's no additional subject<br>and karma so anybody can do enter this<br>stage and it is a career so just to give<br>you an example even in this times of<br>uncertainty if we're still getting<br>employers morning our students to start<br>with them so we've had 100% employment<br>rate which I don't think anyone else in<br>the entire university could say if he do<br>this degree you will get a career in<br>this field because you don't have enough<br>planners in New Zealand we're a growing<br>country we've got huge demands on our<br>resources and even in times of austerity<br>where we look in a post covered response<br>we've got an infrastructure let response<br>which means that this is a career which<br>is actually in more demand even right<br>now that it was last year so these are<br>real careers so a lot of times when you<br>see this kind of slide<br>we'll just be quite generic but I can<br>tell you the names of people who work in<br>these areas because this is what we do<br>we have understand the employment rate<br>for the last three or four years and if<br>you let us know the kind have failed in<br>the kind of area which you're most<br>interested in we can direct you towards<br>that pathways so it could be around<br>strategic plans are looking at featured<br>growths<br>like at the Golden Triangle of Hamilton<br>Alton and Toronto and how we should grow<br>and how do we put train lines down<br>there's also a lot of Eva management and<br>looking at the use of water resources<br>and those kind of aspects where we have<br>to restore some of our native well in<br>the restoration we also work with<br>multiple multinational consult census so<br>the only good thing about a planner is<br>it's a trade so if you get a degree from<br>Waikato you can practice this apana in<br>London and Hong Kong in Hong Kong and<br>Melbourne and every year we send<br>graduates abroad to become for a career<br>overseas because it's the New Zealand<br>planets cube accreditations recognized<br>all around the world so it's with honors<br>and it's designed with industry and<br>professions so we have close<br>relationships with practitioners<br>employers there's a good chance your<br>employer will have electric you at some<br>point during the course and we have<br>three flexible streams which I'll talk<br>to you a little bit about later that's<br>the structure of our program so the blue<br>bits are the core that we have to teach<br>and the orange bits of the stream where<br>you've got the ability to select areas<br>where you're most interested in - shake<br>your career profile so we also offer a<br>minor so for those of you who are<br>interested but I may be not sure if you<br>do these papers it allows you the<br>flexibility to say you've got a minor in<br>if I'm not plan which is people for<br>people interested in science but what to<br>know more about how to exert influence<br>and get changing their life for example<br>but you can actually get in degrees upon<br>unless you have to follow policies<br>great so the streams we have at the man<br>we have three streams the science one is<br>four percent it's not that everybody<br>gets the core skills to work anywhere in<br>any field it just gives you a chance to<br>check your degree an area where you're<br>most comfortable or where you actually<br>want more in-depth knowledge so if<br>you're interested in biology or soil or<br>oceans coast we can actually you can do<br>more science papers and that lead you to<br>a good career with say Regional Council<br>a lot in caramel some of those science<br>areas where you actually need to have a<br>good understanding of some of the basics<br>in order to then apply that to our laws<br>and regulation second stream is society<br>so we go a little bit more economics<br>more politics but more public policy and<br>this is around people who want to exert<br>influence so we've got to write the laws<br>on water quality we've got to understand<br>how to balance some of the issues with<br>farming and agricultural practices and<br>this is around navigating those<br>different views about how to get the<br>best outcomes of people a third stream<br>is the only stream of this nature in New<br>Zealand it's our taro tile stream which<br>is basically a strong marine indigenous<br>specialism there's a big rise in care<br>management and shared services and so on<br>and to understand those issues more<br>deeply we wouldn't the Faculty of Maui<br>Indigenous Studies it honestly give you<br>more in-depth knowledge in that area so<br>you can make some much and you can pick<br>between above the stream is just<br>basically allowed to shape your degree<br>in a flexible way so if you are<br>interested this sounds like something<br>that you might be interested in doing<br>there's two main courses to just jot<br>down and make them know off and it's our<br>main courses its restoration semester<br>day so intention to environmental<br>planning is where you start to get the<br>basics and the foundation and our future<br>cities where you start and look at some<br>of the impacts that we're gonna have to<br>manage and deal with so even<br>if you want sure whether this is for you<br>if you do these two courses in the first<br>year it allows you the flexibility to<br>switch to a BP degree at the end of year<br>one because you've got the foundation<br>done so we always recommend people to do<br>those even if you're not entirely sure<br>whether it be please degree but we do<br>tend to have more people changing after<br>the first year as they try out I realize<br>that this is actually what I've been<br>looking for and it's pretty uncertain<br>environment out there at the moment to<br>be studying and we recognize that<br>there's quite a few there's some<br>restructuring going on with our society<br>which think it shifts over for that week<br>we've got more people working from home<br>there's some big issues that were having<br>to deal with and some sectors are<br>struggling for investment but planning<br>isn't one of them and it's only because<br>the government has decided that they're<br>gonna have an infrastructure led<br>stimulus and renewal and so we need much<br>more planners that have gone because<br>someone's going to make decisions and so<br>if you are looking for a career and it<br>is a real career than this and with a<br>good chance of your investment in your<br>education pay enough this is a really<br>good bet because we know you will be<br>working in this area at the end more<br>likely than perhaps many other causes<br>and it also has a chance to do things<br>for the better so this is some of you<br>may have caught this story so if you<br>haven't just google it so it's a 20<br>minute city in Hamilton and it's a story<br>I wrote<br>about a month ago about how we need to<br>use the infrastructure be able to change<br>how we live and how to move around and<br>now this is a live issue that we're<br>researching of like hello is that the<br>way the pun is what's in the past<br>doesn't have to be how it does at the<br>moment we can shape our cities so we<br>have to travel this so we can adapt to<br>climate change<br>matching more the community and<br>well-being angle to so we could get<br>involved as women national debates about<br>what planning could and should be so<br>this is the kind of debate we hope you<br>be involved in to<br>so just to finish off that's my name and<br>my email at top dr. Sylvius our nominee<br>see the program convener she's also<br>available to answer questions so you can<br>subjects online and you can giggle a<br>Facebook page and have a lot there but<br>also if there's any questions feel free<br>to ask them now in the webinar chat and<br>I'll hang around and deal with them<br>but also feel free to send me an email<br>and hopefully we'll see you in one of<br>our classes soon okay Kurata thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
