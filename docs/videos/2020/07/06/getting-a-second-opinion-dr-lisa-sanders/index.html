hora Norah<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou<br>katoa I'm enraged you tell I'd like to<br>welcome you all here I'm delighted to<br>see such a good turnout on such a<br>terribly chosen day I know a lot of you<br>are between holidays and it's very good<br>of you to come<br>gives me great pleasure to introduce my<br>friend and colleague Lisa Sanders who's<br>really a leader internationally in the<br>work on diagnosis and particularly on<br>the outreach the telling stories about<br>the understanding of all the social<br>contexts of diagnosis at least I can't<br>wait to hear what you have to tell us<br>today welcome I can't tell you how<br>excited I am to be here in New Zealand<br>this is one of those places you don't<br>know because you're from here but in the<br>rest of the world this is a place that<br>lives large in the imagination at least<br>you know in my imagination and I think<br>in many people so it's so extraordinary<br>to be here and it's fantastic to be able<br>to spend time with Emery and also it's<br>great to be able to talk about something<br>that I don't this is kind of a different<br>kind of talk for me because it's a<br>little bit more personal than I usually<br>get but I'm I had occasion to start<br>thinking about second opinions and I<br>wanted to share those thoughts with you<br>I write a column for The New York Times<br>Magazine called diagnosis and in my<br>column I tell the story of a single<br>patient who developed some symptoms and<br>it's a little bit mysterious and I sort<br>of follow the path from presentation to<br>the medical establishment to tell the<br>diagnosis is made and sort of interested<br>in interesting diseases but what I'm<br>really interested in is the sort of<br>mysterious really cognitive processes<br>and other kinds of processes that get<br>get from mystery to solution I've been<br>writing my column for a long time for 18<br>years and in the course of that I get a<br>lot of people who write to me and say oh<br>could you help me figure out what's<br>wrong with me I've had symptoms for so<br>long and no one can tell me and I've had<br>all these tests and I'm perfectly<br>everyone tells me that perfectly fine<br>but I'm not and you know I'm I'm with<br>the late broadcaster David Brinkley and<br>I think that everyone is entitled to my<br>opinion but it's not always so easy I<br>don't see patients who live more than a<br>hundred miles away from me because I<br>hate to disappoint people and I'm just<br>not sure that I travelling to visit me<br>it's going to be worth more than a<br>hundred miles really I tell them when<br>they call me that you know I am an<br>internist I don't solve the cases that I<br>write about most of them some of them I<br>did but most of them I I tell the story<br>I don't I don't make the solutions but<br>if they live in a hundred miles and<br>they're okay with that and it sounds<br>like it's something I can help them with<br>and of course I see them so I am the<br>second opinion for many people but for<br>the past few years I've had reason to<br>think about second opinions in a<br>slightly different context and that's<br>what I want to talk about today so<br>here's the first rule that we all learn<br>in you know medical speaking 101 start<br>with a patient so a previously healthy<br>53 year old woman<br>for a routine screening colonoscopy and<br>wake up from the propofol my<br>gastroenterologist says what you have<br>cancer you know and I said well you're<br>you're kidding right and he goes no and<br>he shows me this picture and I don't<br>think it's subtle but just in case it's<br>not clear that big ugly thing there is a<br>tumor I'm at Yale I teach at Yale so I<br>reached out to colleagues that I knew of<br>I'd heard of and respected some of them<br>had taught me and I picked an oncologist<br>Jill Lacey and a surgeon Ron Salem Ron<br>Salem teaches you know is now emeritus<br>but you know taught everybody who's<br>anybody colorectal surgery and and they<br>explained to me what was going to happen<br>so first it was going to be a month of<br>chemotherapy and radiation at the same<br>time to shrink the tumor and then there<br>would be surgery and then there would be<br>six more weeks of chemotherapy this is<br>what they were talking about with the<br>surgery so they would cut off that<br>little kink there that's faded out is<br>the affected part mine was not nearly<br>that big but that's where it was located<br>they would take that out and then they<br>would take the top end that up there and<br>pull it through my the skin of my<br>stomach and then they would give me a<br>colostomy bag<br>and I would wear that colostomy bag for<br>a year or so until the surgeon felt that<br>I would be okay to have my guts<br>put back together well really that was<br>not fine with me<br>and so I argued about it I said you know<br>don't be ridiculous<br>I'm 53 years old I do not need a<br>colostomy bag to interfere with my sense<br>of myself is a completely healthy person<br>briefly sidelined by cancer which is of<br>course how we all think of ourselves<br>even within the midst of sickness we<br>don't think of ourselves as being well<br>maybe some people do but I think many of<br>us think of ourselves as somebody who's<br>just this is a this is a sidecar this is<br>you know this is a little you know thing<br>with an Asterix that goes down at the<br>bottom of the page this is not the main<br>event and I was not interested in having<br>a colostomy bag you know if dr. Salem<br>who I respect greatly said well that is<br>what's recommended because of where it's<br>located and the difficulty of having<br>something at abend putting those two<br>things together it might just come apart<br>and you could get septic and die and I<br>said well to myself I thought doesn't<br>sound like such a bad choice so I<br>realized that I needed a second opinion<br>I felt now is anybody here gone for a<br>second opinion for anything has anybody<br>ever been sick enough so people have<br>told me my patients I'm a doctor I see<br>patients I've told me that they<br>hesitated to get a second opinion<br>because they were worried that their<br>doctor would be mad at them or they felt<br>like they were cheating on their doctor<br>like there's some sort of one of some<br>sort of intimate relationship and there<br>is of course a very intimate<br>relationship between doctors and<br>patients but I thought I don't care<br>I felt bad but not that bad and I did<br>feel a little bit like I was done<br>you're shopping you know when people<br>wrote to me for a second opinion<br>I know that I was like 9 or 10 or 12 or<br>15 or 20th on their list I know that<br>many of the people who call me to see me<br>for a second opinion are doctor shopping<br>they are looking for a doctor that will<br>tell them what they want to hear oh<br>honey that was me I was looking for a<br>doctor who was going to tell me what I<br>wanted to hear which was I could be<br>cured and not have a colostomy for a<br>year or two I just it wasn't part of my<br>self-image and I just wasn't sure I<br>could get over it so I wanted to find<br>out if there was an alternative to this<br>bag insert tasteless joke about matching<br>his shoes with your bag here but I just<br>wasn't gonna have a part of it so I<br>found a surgeon at one of the great<br>institutions in the United States for<br>cancer sloan-kettering<br>and he was willing to do it in fact he<br>was all of his research was in rectal<br>surgery colorectal surgery with a focus<br>on trying to do it as with this little<br>interruption of real life as possible so<br>he told me that it was he would do it it<br>would be risky and if he thought it<br>wasn't going to be successful I would<br>wake up with the colostomy but if he<br>could he would there's this was<br>important to me there's this book that<br>if you're a doctor you probably if<br>you're a doctor in the United States<br>you've probably read called the house of<br>God it's a it's kind of a satire set in<br>written by a guy who did his internship<br>in the house of God Beth Israel it's<br>part of the Harvard Medical School<br>Health System and in this in this novel<br>which is fantastic and dismal and I<br>can't reread it because it's still way<br>too close to the truth the philosopher<br>King hero<br>is a fellow named the fat man and the<br>fat man has a bunch of rules that you<br>hear about through the book throughout<br>the book and one of his premiere rules<br>is the patient is the one with the<br>disease I cannot tell you how much<br>walking through the doors of<br>sloan-kettering to get this surgery<br>affected me because that is wrong you go<br>to medical school so you will never be<br>the person who is walking through the<br>door to get surgery you know I mean it's<br>that kind of a bargain you make with God<br>or fate or whatever it is that if you<br>know about it then you won't actually<br>have it but I did have it and I did walk<br>through those doors and it was<br>absolutely horrifying I was now the one<br>in the bed something I never wanted to<br>be but I pulled myself together and<br>after a month of radiation in a month of<br>chemo I and a month walking the road to<br>Santiago I went to sloan-kettering for<br>my surgery and it all turned out just<br>fine but it did make me think about<br>second opinions think differently about<br>second opinions I mean everybody sort of<br>thinks oh you should get you tell your<br>mother your friend your patient when<br>they're somebodies suggest they go to<br>surgery oh you should get a second<br>opinion or if they suggest some sort of<br>radical treatment oh you should get a<br>second opinion<br>thinking that what you're actually<br>looking for is somebody even smarter<br>than your own doctor who will tell you<br>whether your doctor is right or not<br>that's how we think of a second opinion<br>and I realized that that's not always<br>the case and perhaps is never the case I<br>mean if if it didn't fit me who's it<br>gonna fit it was my feeling so you know<br>this fella was seeking a second opinion<br>this is how we usually seek second<br>opinions<br>what I when I'm talking about second<br>opinions I'm really talking about second<br>opinions that patients request so we<br>think that we think that that a second<br>opinion is for the patient but actually<br>doctors have been getting second<br>opinions from each other for a really<br>really long time perhaps the most<br>well-established kind of second opinion<br>that doctors get is something called a<br>tumor board I don't know if you have<br>them here but everybody who gets<br>diagnosed with cancer even me they have<br>their slides presented to a bunch of<br>pathologists and surgeons and<br>radiologists and then they they discuss<br>what the treatment ought to be that's<br>why dr. Salem could said to me could<br>look at me straight in the face and go<br>this is the way it's done here because<br>he discussed it with the tumor board and<br>that is the way it's done here but it's<br>not just in in tumor boards I mean in<br>pathology second opinions are routine<br>and in some institutions they're<br>absolutely mandatory and it can make a<br>difference in one study of patients who<br>were seeking a second opinion at the<br>Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota which<br>is a fantastic institution there were<br>over 20,000 cases reviewed these are<br>cases where patients if you call up the<br>Mayo Clinic and say I want to see a<br>doctor<br>they'll tell you what to do and they'll<br>tell you you need to send us all of your<br>records and all of your slides and all<br>of your imaging and then they'll review<br>them so that when you come they're<br>already up to speed on your case and so<br>they looked at 20,000 cases where people<br>sent in slides to the pathologist and<br>the the Mayo Clinic pathologist reviewed<br>the slides before they saw the patient<br>so in these 20,000 that the number or<br>the percentage of slides in which the<br>Mayo Clinic doctors came up with a<br>different answer than the doctors<br>who saw before was a very encouraging 1%<br>1% they found were different where their<br>determination about what was going on<br>was different than the first doctor that<br>was about four hundred and fifty seven<br>cases and in each of these cases the<br>discrepancy affected either the<br>prognosis of the patient or the<br>treatment that they should get so 1%<br>that's pretty good that really to me<br>suggests that that is why you seek a<br>second opinion<br>it's to get somebody to reassure you<br>that what your doctor told you was right<br>so you can go back and get what<br>everybody thinks you should get other<br>studies have found less agreed less<br>often up to 15% of the time there were<br>some disagreements and so in those it<br>raises a question of who's right right<br>if you have two doctors the first the<br>first doctor sees you and says you have<br>cancer and the second doctor sees you<br>and says yeah I don't know who's right<br>we don't actually know the answer to<br>that in the Mayo Clinic those 20,000<br>cases a small number of the 457 100 of<br>them were followed up about a year later<br>and mm-hmm<br>in most of the in 73 / 73 cases that<br>diagnosis was the same but in 13 cases<br>it was a different diagnosis I don't<br>know what happened to the other 15%<br>mm-hmm but so maybe in 15 percent of the<br>cases a second look said oh the first<br>guy actually did get it right so that's<br>a concerning discrepancy it's pretty<br>good but not perfect so radiologists<br>also get mandatory or voluntary second<br>opinions I mean virtually every big<br>academic institution requires their<br>radiologists to have somebody else look<br>over their their slides or their films<br>in part because of the volume of what<br>they see and and because if you're going<br>to get sued it's going to be over a<br>diagnosis so how well do the<br>radiologists do so in the literature<br>when people estimate things like<br>pathology and radiologists they think<br>well it's really a tiny minority that<br>are wrong that they're actually really<br>really good and they say you know less<br>than five percent are in error so what<br>do the built-in second opinion say say<br>they did pretty good in one study that<br>looked at again over 20,000 films they<br>found a discrepancy about three percent<br>of the time so that's pretty good and<br>that's films of all varieties but we<br>know that some radiology is a lot better<br>than other kinds of radiology and<br>mammograms they're you know they're the<br>worst because there's a lot of because<br>they're not very good studies and<br>because breast cancer is common and so<br>when you get people who are who<br>specialize in mammography they disagree<br>with each other<br>ten percent ten to twenty percent of the<br>time and about a third of the times when<br>they disagree they're disagreeing with<br>their themselves right so they're<br>looking at the same film that they saw<br>before but now they have a very<br>different take on it so so it's not it's<br>not as perfect as you might hope but<br>that's when doctors<br>ask for second opinion what happens when<br>we US patients I mean putting myself in<br>the patient position what happens when<br>we ask for a second opinion I think<br>there are three questions that people go<br>to seek a second opinion for first is is<br>this the right diagnosis second is is<br>this the right treatment and third is<br>way before that what do I have or the<br>way I see it what do I really have<br>because a lot of those people have<br>already gotten a diagnosis that their<br>doctor is satisfied with but they are<br>not satisfied with they feel like it<br>doesn't really describe what they have<br>given the frequency of second opinions<br>and it's gotten to be much more frequent<br>it's twice as people asked force between<br>the 1980s and the 1990s which was the<br>last time this was like that you know<br>the number of the percentage of people<br>who are seen at a doctor's office has<br>and asked for a second opinion has<br>doubled so it was like a piddling like 5<br>or 10% and now it's about 10 to 20<br>percent depending on what where you look<br>at it and given the frequency of second<br>opinions it's really important to know<br>whether and to what extent these second<br>opinions improve the quality of patient<br>care or whether it just improves the<br>patient's satisfaction with what doctors<br>tell them so most of the studies this is<br>not this is not well described in the<br>literature and most of the studies have<br>been done on the first question is this<br>the right diagnosis most of the work has<br>been done with patients who like me were<br>given a cancer diagnosis and wanted to<br>make sure that the diagnosis was right<br>and that the treatment was right more or<br>less in one large study the second<br>opinion agreed completely or had just<br>minor<br>discrepancies in over 80% of the cases<br>but 16% of the time there was a major<br>disagreement in another study this one<br>of men looking for a second opinion<br>after getting a diagnosis of prostate<br>cancer there was a change in treatment<br>but not in diagnosis 40% of the time and<br>of those who got a different treatment<br>recommendation these are men who had<br>prostate cancer that was early stage not<br>spread outside the capsule so this is a<br>very controversial area once it's spread<br>you know all bets are off<br>but once while it's still in the capsule<br>it's not clear which way it's going to<br>go and it's like the pathology they have<br>is kind of like mammograms maybe it's a<br>good way of knowing maybe not and so of<br>the people who got a different<br>recommendation where there was a<br>discrepancy between the second opinion<br>in the first opinion the second opinion<br>almost always recommended much more<br>aggressive treatment you know and this<br>is to me this seems like a bad thing you<br>know I mean prostate cancer the<br>treatment of prostate cancer has been<br>very controversial it's a really maiming<br>surgery that causes impotence and<br>incontinence and men sometime for the<br>rest of their lives so going to surgery<br>sometimes makes patients feel better I<br>can't bear to have that in my body but<br>it may not make the rest of their lives<br>better and it may not have any effect at<br>all on their mortality when you look<br>into my area of expertise which is<br>internal medicine many more of those<br>patients are actually looking for help<br>with the diagnosis the symptoms that are<br>most frequently associated with these<br>kinds of searches are those that are the<br>hardest to diagnose to begin with the<br>two most common are on fatigue very<br>difficult<br>abdominal pain also difficult in<br>research done in this area one study<br>found the second this type of second<br>opinion of these sort of vague symptoms<br>ninety percent of the time they either<br>made no diagnosis or agreed with the<br>original diagnosis but seventy percent<br>of the time they had a different<br>treatment plan what does that mean I'm<br>not really I'm not really sure who seeks<br>this kind of second opinion well women<br>middle-aged women I mean me that's who<br>it is that's who seeks this kind of<br>opinion middle-aged women the average<br>age is 54 and and most of the patients<br>who were seeking these these diagnoses<br>had been suffering with their symptoms<br>for years but what's interesting and<br>strange and a little bit disappointing<br>to me is that none of these studies<br>really looked at whether the first<br>opinion or the second opinion or the<br>third opinion at the fourth opinion was<br>right<br>or whether taking the second opinion<br>advice made any difference at all about<br>whether these people lived or died or<br>got sicker or got better there are ways<br>to check this and they've never been<br>done I don't know why this is exactly it<br>seems to me it would be obvious that you<br>would want to know I think the<br>assumption is of course the second<br>opinion is better duh but there are lots<br>of things that we thought duh about<br>where we were completely wrong I think<br>they're difficult but I also think that<br>and maybe this is just my cynical self<br>we have the worst president in the<br>planet right now sand makes it brings<br>out the cynicism in all of us but maybe<br>it's because second opinions are an<br>important source of income for a lot of<br>institutions and that's just getting<br>bigger and so nobody really wants to<br>know<br>whether it's helpful or not and<br>everybody if you ever met a doctor you<br>might know that humility is not a strong<br>suit not even among internists and I<br>think everybody everybody who's a doctor<br>thinks that they are by far the smartest<br>doctor in the room so of course their<br>diagnosis is the right one in any case<br>it's something that really needs to be<br>needs to be figured out but it hasn't<br>been and now there are there are there<br>are companies that have that are set up<br>just to give second opinions this is<br>this is probably the most well known<br>it's called best doctors and they're<br>just a professional second opinion<br>organization they're not alone I mean<br>probably the most famous one of these is<br>the Mayo Clinic you know they have a<br>Mayo Clinic is this enormous institution<br>the size of a city in this little town<br>of Rochester Minnesota you know the<br>number of patients that are from the<br>region is tiny miniscule really<br>everybody else comes from all over the<br>world to get opinions at the Mayo Clinic<br>and other people have decided that to<br>follow up with that Johns Hopkins has<br>recently started a second opinion<br>a tele second opinion a distance second<br>opinion service so has Massachusetts<br>General Hospital these distant you know<br>they can do give you a second opinion<br>from a distance we still don't know<br>whether a second opinion<br>does anything besides make the patient<br>like me feel a lot better about the<br>choices that they've made but that's<br>where we stand now it's a growing<br>industry and we may not actually know<br>very much about it<br>one of the things that grew out of my<br>own experience with second opinions is I<br>started writing a different column I I<br>continued to write my diagnosis column<br>but I started writing a new column<br>because I thought<br>I don't know I thought maybe maybe real<br>people had something to offer in the way<br>of second opinions and so I wrote this<br>column called Think Like a doctor and in<br>this column I would tell the story of a<br>patient with their symptoms this was the<br>story of a painter who developed these<br>headaches and then started having<br>strange visual changes and personality<br>changes so I tell the story right and<br>give all the information notes test<br>results imaging anything that anybody<br>could want right up until the point<br>where the doctor was going to make the<br>diagnosis when I given the page the<br>reader everything that the doctor had or<br>everything that was important that the<br>doctor had I'd stop and say what do you<br>think it is and then people would write<br>in like hundreds of people would write<br>it here this one 219 people wrote in<br>with what they thought was going on with<br>this painter and then the next day in<br>the afternoon I would write the solution<br>and say who you know who what the right<br>answer was and who was the first person<br>who came up with it and this was this is<br>why his wife was worried he went from<br>painting these lovely pastoral scenes to<br>these much darker weirder scenes and he<br>had he had a girl fistula it was really<br>very dramatic he got fixed and he's all<br>fine but what I saw was that you know<br>lots of people were interested in<br>engaging in in this practice you know to<br>me this was a Sherlock Holmes story you<br>know except my thought was if you could<br>see this the way I could see this you<br>would think it was cool and so this was<br>my invitation to people to try and see<br>it the way I saw it the way a doctor or<br>a nurse or anybody who sees patients<br>might see it<br>it was mostly medical students nursing<br>students veterinarian students who got<br>the right answer probably they have the<br>most time and the most knowledge<br>but you know there were more than one<br>time when it was just a patient who goes<br>oh yeah no my end my Aunt Sue had that<br>well you know and of course that's how<br>doctors make diagnoses too they<br>recognize it oh yeah I had a patient who<br>had that before so it's to some extent<br>it's the same kind of practice my goal<br>or one of the things that I always<br>wanted to do with this was to I was so<br>impressed with the quality of the<br>thought that came from these readers who<br>decided to devote you know I mean I they<br>could have been doing the crossword<br>puzzle they could have been working they<br>could have been doing their bills but<br>instead they were actually looking<br>through these notes and trying to figure<br>this out and I thought that was<br>extremely cool and I thought I wonder if<br>we could recruit these people to<br>diagnose people who didn't have a<br>diagnosis all of the patients that I<br>wrote about in this series for five<br>years they all had diagnoses and so I<br>was able to give the answer the next day<br>guess what this is what they had isn't<br>that cool and this is how they everybody<br>figured it out so I thought oh wouldn't<br>it be cool if we could do it on patients<br>who didn't have a diagnosis I never<br>quite got there but somebody else did<br>this guy this is a this is a company<br>they make money a company called crowd<br>med organ I started by a guy named Jared<br>Heyman and he called me before he<br>launched his business to say you know<br>this is the stepchild of your think like<br>a doctor I owe this all to you I'm like<br>oh god what have I done<br>and so they like doctors themselves so<br>this has been going on for about a year<br>and they have done their published<br>studies about how successful they are<br>but of course like doctors they haven't<br>looked into what the patient really had<br>they haven't tried to say<br>here's what the our crowd says and this<br>is what we think they had they only ask<br>the patient if the patient is satisfied<br>with the information that the crowd<br>provided them not surprisingly they're<br>very satisfied yeah I don't know if it's<br>right and I got to be quite alarmed<br>there's a radio does anybody listen to<br>podcasts in here I listen to that I'm<br>addicted to them so there's one called<br>reply all does anybody know this one<br>it's about tech fabulous anyway they<br>were doing a story about crowd med and<br>they called me up and they said we're<br>just wondering if you could come on the<br>radio and explain the diagnosis that<br>this woman had I said well tell me about<br>the patient I said well she's a middle<br>aged woman who had pain in her neck that<br>radiated up into her head and blurry<br>vision and maybe a little bit of a<br>facial droop and her neck really really<br>hurts and she was diagnosed with<br>sternocleidomastoid syndrome so the<br>sternocleidomastoid czar these muscles<br>in your neck and i said well gosh it<br>sounds to me like she has a carotid<br>dissection did she get what did the CT<br>scan show oh she didn't get a CT scan<br>show so she doesn't know I said well I<br>do think that she ought to get a CT scan<br>and see what it says cuz of course not<br>everybody dies or strokes out if you<br>have a carotid dissection some people do<br>fine and she did fine she got a CT scan<br>it didn't show anything do I think she<br>didn't have a carotid dissection that<br>she had sternocleidomastoid syndrome I<br>do not so I called up Jared and I said<br>don't<br>why don't you program your system to<br>have red flags you know things that<br>would go that would catch somebody's<br>attention so that if somebody like this<br>woman who really needed what could be it<br>wasn't for her but what could be<br>saving intervention she could get it and<br>he said yeah well we thought about that<br>but that doesn't really scale you can't<br>really take care of millions of people<br>if you're going to be that<br>detail-oriented so I sort of mad at my<br>stepchild so I'm not I'm not sure he did<br>it the right way but I do think there's<br>a way to do it and I finally got a<br>chance to do that to try a different way<br>so I have a series that's going to come<br>on Netflix called diagnosis it's based<br>on my column except in this we take on<br>patients who are in search of a<br>diagnosis and then I present them the<br>way I did with my think like a doctor<br>column I give the studies I read all of<br>their records give the pertinent<br>findings and put it out there in the<br>world to see if the New York Times crowd<br>could offer some possibilities because<br>what is it that you're really looking<br>for in this setting what you're looking<br>for is something well what people<br>usually say is somebody who thinks<br>outside the box that's when people call<br>me they say we're looking for somebody<br>who thinks outside the box I guess<br>that's a good thing but what they really<br>want is a very broad differential and so<br>this is the broadest possible<br>differential I'm gonna show you just one<br>small clip from one of the one of the<br>ones that's going to air I've never done<br>this before I've edited this and<br>hopefully it will run and I don't have<br>to just narrate a still picture so we'll<br>say so this is Sadie and I'll let her<br>no audio uh what did I tell you about<br>the audio<br>it's always the audio that does you in<br>okay teri no audio okay okay right okay<br>all right yep okay where are we<br>yep there we go got it oh this is<br>crowdsourcing yes see was that perfect<br>or it was all it was a sorry there we go<br>it was all part of the demonstration<br>wasn't it wait okay wait wait go back<br>and make it louder louder great walk<br>here thank you<br>crowd<br>three miles<br>okay mama that broken no duck steady<br>Sadie has a seizure disorder in which<br>you'll find out about this fen really<br>debilitating yeah but there's not deer<br>say any of you feel like you got wobbly<br>just stand still okay<br>I don't like the Schafer's sometimes it<br>happens to my leg on my toe every time I<br>walk I almost fall down when you have a<br>messenger and you talk try by just clap<br>you have the one down<br>but anyway so that's one of our patients<br>and so we showed a little bit not this<br>but we showed a little bit of film and I<br>showed and I summarized her story from<br>her records and then you know hundreds<br>of people wrote in you know a lot of<br>times those people were just you know<br>wishing the mom well and offering<br>thoughts and prayers and you know<br>sympathy but there was a good portion of<br>them that also made very thoughtful<br>suggestions they weren't all right<br>obviously you know it's not like they<br>all said she obviously has blah because<br>if it was that obvious she'd have a<br>diagnosis by now but it allowed her<br>family and her doctors to think about it<br>more broadly now let me just say doctors<br>did not necessarily welcome this<br>surprise but the families did and I<br>think that's really given how little we<br>know about second opinions that's really<br>all you can hope for is that you give<br>the family the patient the tools to move<br>forward with what's with what's<br>happening next so I think she has a<br>diagnosis I can't tell you because<br>Netflix would have to shoot me and<br>everybody in the room but because<br>they're very crazy secretive but you<br>know I think that having all these other<br>voices was helpful for the family and<br>then may be helpful for the doctor so<br>what is the role of a second opinion I<br>don't think we really know I mean I'm<br>going on the idea that it's there so<br>that patients can find out more about<br>what's going on with them from a bunch<br>of from different mouths and if<br>minds and as somebody who saw all the<br>suggestions that came in let me just say<br>most of the suggestions didn't really<br>make sense you know if you're really new<br>medicine and you really read the case<br>you would realize that you know most of<br>them were not right but there was a core<br>in each of these cases there was a core<br>of really smart thoughtful takes that<br>were worth investigating and I think<br>when you don't have a diagnosis that's<br>really all you can ask for it's having a<br>different perspective somebody with a<br>different take on what's going on<br>so that was my that's been my journey in<br>second opinions you know I realized from<br>my own experience that it does it's not<br>like going to God to find out what the<br>right answer is it's a little bit more<br>complicated and a little bit less<br>effective so thank you very much I'd be<br>happy to answer any questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
