pleasure to talk to you about<br>today about scholarship opportunities<br>and as you'll see from the first side<br>we're talking about funding<br>opportunities from day one and I'm<br>thinking day one 2001 so for all over<br>the time that you're at the University<br>of Waikato so I've got three needs to<br>mean the lovely gasps and he's going to<br>talk to you later<br>about his area of expertise but I'm glad<br>that gathers here because it's not just<br>the scholarships advising team on campus<br>that will help you out with scholarships<br>it's actually the people who help you<br>get good grades make the most of your<br>time at the University of Idaho and<br>Gantz one of those guys so I'll tell you<br>more about those helper teams little<br>later so where do you find out about<br>scholarships at White Castle well on the<br>university landing page you can see<br>there there's the funds scholarship okay<br>so we're pretty high-profile being on<br>the landing page and that's because you<br>need the money let's see what happens if<br>you click on that button it takes you to<br>our scholarships finder and it's where<br>you can search and filter one of the<br>scholarships that the University of<br>Michael is offering and that's a great<br>sort of way of trimming down a list of<br>scholarship opportunities for yourself<br>hanging onto your own needs but if<br>you're looking at this on your own<br>mobile phone layout might be a little<br>different but if you are looking on your<br>mobile phone just click on the in the CH<br>and view and you'll see all the buttons<br>I'm about to talk about so in the<br>scholarships find them we're obviously<br>our scholarships but across to the left<br>of the screen as I'm looking at it I've<br>got a standard buttons let's go first to<br>the scholarship if they use frequently<br>asked questions those are just some of<br>them we keep changing them depending on<br>the season scholarship season but the<br>you can effectively on sand nine out of<br>ten of your questions itself so that's a<br>great place to always go and then let's<br>go down a couple of steps or three steps<br>and get to browsing for scholarships the<br>application process so that's a really<br>good place to to just get those steps<br>and say okay how do I actually start my<br>application for a scholarship at least<br>another university town scholarships<br>brilliant whether you going for a school<br>needle scholarship or a high level<br>scholarship please look at this advice<br>save you lots of time and another button<br>and it's my favorite but you to the left<br>of the screen is the scholarships update<br>because it's like reading our minds if<br>you're looking there you know everything<br>that we know every month about all of<br>the scholarships that university is<br>offering and all of the externally<br>funded scholarships that are out there<br>and that's why our old fashioned ways if<br>there's more because scholarships finder<br>it sound scholarships scholarships<br>update it's everything that we know<br>about and so some people saying is it<br>worth applying for scholarships and I<br>say when I lose you'll be developing<br>some great skills and we've heard that<br>from our scholarship applicants from<br>years gone by how useful it's been but<br>every scholarships opportunity is worth<br>looking at and we advertising<br>scholarships and our amp tape that are<br>worth between $400 and $400,000 but<br>let's Lincoln an example here's one I<br>can't pitched it in the middle it's<br>worth us more at $40,000 just shows the<br>lay out what we put in the scholarships<br>update the name of the scholarship<br>closing date the levels of study it's<br>aimed at and a brief little explanation<br>so that you can say that doesn't suit me<br>bday today but I'm going to remember<br>that for three years time and then just<br>click<br>through the whole update and you'll be<br>learning about hundreds of thousands of<br>scholarship opportunities silly years go<br>by this is where you're helping team<br>comes in again there are people like<br>gasps there are other

website<br>and you still have questions please<br>email us is the addresses scholarships<br>that one console that ac30 and said<br>something I'll hand them out together so<br>I'm a librarian so I'm just going to<br>tell you a little bit about the library<br>if I do be too fast or if you have<br>questions during this feel free to ask<br>them in the chat right so the university<br>has three libraries across the three<br>campuses the first one is the Central<br>Library in the Hamilton campus and<br>that's located in the Student Center or<br>the M block and that's where we'll store<br>most of our physical resources our books<br>DVDs CDs and output journals<br>there's also clearing a study space<br>inside the building itself and lots of<br>computers which can be accessed 24/7 so<br>do stop by if you're on campus and meet<br>somewhere to go study<br>the second library on campus on the main<br>campus is they teaching resources<br>library and that's located in the<br>teaching block in the TL building or<br>teaching library and you can find that<br>on the third floor of the TR block if<br>it's a little bit of a maze so if you<br>can't find your way around there do ask<br>someone I'm not gonna go make small<br>direct to that the teaching resource<br>library had contained a lot of things<br>for trainee teachers to be used in<br>schools and the stuff that can be burned<br>by any student so we've got a lots of<br>picture books and if you want to borrow<br>some of those maybe read them to your<br>child you're absolutely welcome to the<br>third library would be the library in<br>Tirana it's a smaller library we've got<br>a small collection of books there it can<br>be found in the 24 hour computer lab on<br>the first floor if you want a book<br>that's not available in the Terramax<br>library it can request from the main<br>library if the central library will be<br>brought over for you that usually takes<br>two or three days so book ahead of time<br>right so there's plenty that the library<br>can do for you<br>we offer services like reference in help<br>which you'll need in the audio<br>assignments at University we also offer<br>help with searching for information<br>usually academic texts and these are<br>skills that as was mentioned you will be<br>using during your scholarship<br>applications what the library does is<br>help you get these things right so that<br>your mask can be better and it will also<br>help you after University and through<br>and turn it in and after okay we offer a<br>lot of help online which is the big<br>thing especially this year so we've got<br>our chat with the librarian which you<br>can use for them anywhere although how<br>library chapters have set house which is<br>from 9 a.m.<br>to 5:00 p.m. New Zealand time after that<br>we do have a chat bot that can help you<br>get certain places but won't be able to<br>help your reference unless it's sending<br>you to the guides page we also offer a<br>bunch of workshops which cover<br>referencing fun and information and<br>generally using the library better these<br>are online pre-recorded or live and they<br>will suffer them on campus both internet<br>and in Hamilton oh we've also got a<br>consultation process so you can see us<br>for some time some one-on-one time with<br>the librarian if you miss the workshops<br>or you need help finding something for<br>an assignment we can set that up for you<br>so on our website there is a link to our<br>workshops on how to book a consultation<br>with librarian we've also got video<br>guides which is different from our<br>workshops they've broken down into<br>smaller sections they cover various<br>topics and we've got the virtual<br>reference desk which is part of Moodle<br>so in your Moodle papers at the top<br>there there's a library section you<br>click on there and go to a little<br>Reference Desk it has video guides links<br>to our video guides but most importantly<br>it's got lots of lots of referencing<br>helpful APA okay so those were the<br>services the resources that the library<br>has comes directly from you'll fees for<br>University the university gives the<br>library a lot of money which should get<br>from you and with that money we buy<br>access to a lot of databases very<br>expensive databases during your studies<br>as you are looking for information<br>you'll sometimes be asked to pay for<br>access and at the library we say no<br>don't pay never pay for information come<br>and see us and we'll get you that<br>information for free if we already don't<br>have it so we've got any books Eternals<br>everything you need that's really only<br>upon them<br>in print but we've got access to a whole<br>lot of online information that you can<br>get as well as the physical resources in<br>the main library our library search does<br>allow us to search through every single<br>one of these databases we have access to<br>except for two percent of them which we<br>provide access to rather than directly<br>searching them because they are updated<br>too often for us to catalog them into<br>the library search our databases are<br>from all the way all around the world<br>and they include sources that are in<br>other languages such as Mandarin<br>Afrikaans even so we've got them in<br>various languages if you do need them in<br>different things if we can't find it<br>unfortunately it probably doesn't exist<br>so just come and ask us if you do need<br>some specialized information our subject<br>portals are a very important part of<br>finding your way and in search area in<br>particular they allow us to for example<br>with accountant they allow us to get a<br>curated set of resources so the<br>librarians have gone through and picked<br>databases that are mostly related to<br>accounting and dictionaries that will<br>help you with definitions in accounting<br>encyclopedias and journals that are<br>important to accountant they've also got<br>various guides and how through that<br>whole process they're so paying<br>attention to the subject portals for<br>your subject and they will help you a<br>lot some of the other resources we have<br>are for reference in examples so we've<br>got examples on how to reference a<br>chapter in an edited book or online<br>journal versatile in general is plenty<br>of resources and examples that we have<br>for reference in we've also got the<br>reading lists that are part of the<br>library but they are created by your<br>lecturers and they'll have in them print<br>print books that we scan and make<br>available to you as digital copies so if<br>you can't get into the library<br>physically your lecturers set up a<br>system where we scan the books and make<br>them available electronically if you are<br>a distance student and you need access<br>to a chapter in a book that isn't<br>electronic yet you can make a request<br>for us and make a request at the library<br>and we will see what we can do usually<br>the answer is yes but there's a whole<br>lot of copyright stuff that comes into<br>it but we like to know whether we can do<br>it if you just ask us okay so that I<br>think is pretty much these are the ways<br>to contact us our library websites has<br>our phone number our email address with<br>the librarian<br>we've also on we're also on social media<br>we've got a youtube account where we<br>don't keep most of our stuff but if you<br>need a video and you're not able to<br>access YouTube you can ask us and we do<br>have other places where we store those<br>videos we're also on Facebook and on<br>Twitter nothing that's not for us I see<br>that there are some questions okay so<br>you can find out way to go to the APA<br>session I go into our website and<br>clicking on okay tutorial and that<br>almost where all the odd tutorials of<br>care when the next tutorial will be I<br>don't believe that there is one this<br>week there will be some next week and<br>you can look on our pre-recorded videos<br>to get some of those session times a<br>access to the online resources can be<br>found through through the library's<br>website you won't have to login for many<br>of them but to get access to an e-book<br>that's kept in a database the database<br>requires you to be signed in at the<br>university library so that it knows that<br>you have paid access so when you do a<br>search a yellow bar will come up of the<br>screen there and say sign in are you<br>sign in using your university<br>credentials so your University login and<br>password and that will give you access<br>and there is a limit to how many<br>students can access the databases and<br>ebooks but that depends on the database<br>and the e-book in question some ebooks<br>we have unlimited access so all of those<br>students can get access to it and in at<br>the same time others this 3 we have<br>access for three students or one student<br>or 10 students at a time but once a<br>student closes the link the next it will<br>be available for the next student so<br>just keep checking back if you don't<br>have access or come and ask us the<br>library doesn't offer services to help<br>us write in essays but student learning<br>does and if you need help with that you<br>can't come and ask us within the chant<br>and we can show you where the links are<br>and provide you access there the same is<br>true with if you have any questions<br>about scholarships then you can come and<br>ask us and we'll direct you to the<br>ebooks are generally for two weeks issue<br>and they return automatically so you<br>don't need to worry too much about that<br>you can renew them as well that should<br>be new my account settings and the<br>scholarship question for you help with<br>these phases well death if you as well<br>as using the teaching and learning team<br>who have really helped with these days<br>and so forth<br>the there's these career development<br>team on campus<br>and people can go with their they have<br>to fill out a template sieve maybe a<br>personal statement template for a<br>scholarship application they can<br>actually go to the career development<br>team with it and say have you got Akriti<br>you know you have you got any pointers<br>same with their CV take it then<br>so you've got one CV that looks like<br>you're applying to for a part-time job<br>at Subway and they'll help you create<br>another CV that's your scholarship<br>application CV so really helpful know so<br>it's a working - so planning ahead for<br>scholarship somebody asks about planning<br>ahead for second year scholarship that's<br>a brilliant idea<br>I'd be planning for next year and the<br>year after and so forth so can you come<br>to us for insight you might remember<br>that when I flicked up on the on the<br>screen before it seems there $40,000 one<br>must before applying so there are some<br>scholarships just a small number of them<br>where we're saying please do come and<br>talk to us before you apply for the<br>scholarship and it's for good reasons<br>we'll will really make it much easier<br>for you there's big prestigious external<br>scholarships generally you can email us<br>scholarship to a couple but AC NZ at any<br>time with a scholarship query and again<br>it might be that we say yes that's a<br>perfect thing for you to take to the<br>communitive element team to get them to<br>help you with that document yeah to<br>contact us far-out<br>generic email please there's another one<br>for you up there which is can you<br>elaborate on that Lynch of eligibility<br>to apply for any scholarship do you have<br>to be a top student there was a<br>wonderful scholarship that the funder<br>called the scholarship for people who<br>can't win scholarships and they would<br>not look at an A+ student or an aged<br>youth or whatever and that in each see<br>each scholarship has a set of<br>regulations you'll find them on the<br>website our website or on the funders<br>website and then those regulations we<br>talked about eligibility that we section<br>on that and there will be a section on<br>you know what panel is looking<br>for what you know what the funder is<br>looking for and that's tremendously<br>helpful and you just tailoring your<br>application to make sure you're<br>answering the questions that they want<br>to be answered so some of them yes they<br>are looking for brainiacs<br>and some of them they're looking for<br>real people too I'm just going to come<br>into our question answers intent there<br>that you're sending a message just to us<br>so the question was asked is there free<br>Wi-Fi in the library the answer is yes<br>there's free Wi-Fi in the library to<br>students our staff in all the libraries<br>and most of campus has Wi-Fi access as<br>well okay yes the library is open this<br>week open tons of listed on the website<br>they're not full-time yet<br>they're from 8:30 to 5:00 at the moment<br>and on Saturdays but not on Sunday is<br>actually not saturating it's just the<br>24-hour computer labs or you can renew<br>any book just the same amount of times<br>as a print book which is you can renew<br>it twice so you can keep it up for three<br>times the period the first error and<br>then renew it and then renew it again<br>I've got a query that's came out but<br>there are any scholarships for<br>international students and on our fake<br>user frequently asked questions page<br>they've got when you might find helpful<br>which is I'm an international student<br>how do I apply for scholarships also on<br>our scholarships finder you can filter<br>for scholarships for international<br>students I think you'll find that<br>helpful and I can't just say yes or no<br>because you'll find that there might be<br>one scholarship that's for an<br>international student doing the masters<br>and they have already studied early New<br>Zealand University for one year for<br>instance and another one the rules<br>regulations might say no not for you or<br>years you can apply so lots of<br>variations and all of the different<br>kinds of scholarships that are out there<br>but check out those regulations check<br>out our frequently asked questions I<br>think you'll find them really helpful<br>and if you still got questions please<br>email scholarships that work<br>so that is he donated I think that's all<br>our questions it's been really good<br>talking to these students even if we<br>can't see you folks a bit looking<br>forward to meeting you in due course and<br>if we haven't answered any questions and<br>you do have more questions email a<br>librarian</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
