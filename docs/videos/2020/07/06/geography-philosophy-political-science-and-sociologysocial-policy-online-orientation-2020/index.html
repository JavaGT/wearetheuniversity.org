begin<br>hi welcome uh everybody to this webinar<br>that's introducing four key programs<br>from the school of social sciences<br>at the university of wyoming i'm just<br>going to begin by making a few comments<br>about social science before<br>introducing who's up here and and then<br>each of us is going to<br>speak for about 10 minutes on the<br>subjects that we<br>are covering to give you a sense of<br>what you need to know and what you can<br>expect<br>when studying politics<br>geography philosophy and sociology and<br>so we are part of the school of social<br>sciences and social sciences<br>uh is that part of science that deals<br>with humanity and its social aspects<br>and the goal of social sciences is<br>really to help<br>understand and explain how society works<br>so you know in a covert 19 context for<br>example<br>it might involve researching things like<br>why have some countries responded<br>better to code of 19 and the lockdown<br>requirements<br>why so why are some populations more<br>compliant<br>lot better with others and what are the<br>impacts of social<br>isolation associated with specific<br>groups like the elderly who may be less<br>technologically literate or children and<br>young people or why are some groups<br>more likely to become infected<br>poor marginalized groups and of course<br>there are other<br>traditional questions associated with<br>social sciences<br>what leads to social well-being why do<br>people vote<br>why are some populations more likely to<br>be imprisoned<br>than others and what makes people happy<br>so the social sciences is that part of<br>the university that provides vital<br>information<br>on these kinds of issues for government<br>policy makers and others so sitting here<br>we have a group of social scientists<br>um lars braeburn from geography<br>dan weyer from philosophy and juan<br>toby from sociology and social policy<br>and we're each going to run through what<br>you can expect<br>when studying geography philosophy<br>uh sociology and social policy and<br>political science and public policy here<br>at whitefield<br>this semester<br>um so we each have about 10 minutes<br>and after these 10 minute presentations<br>you will be able to<br>respond to any questions you have so<br>you can ask these questions via the chat<br>function<br>so just go in and type a question as it<br>pops into your head<br>type it in as we're running through<br>and it'll be recorded and we'll come<br>so is that okay by way of introduction<br>guys<br>so i'm going to begin and i'm going to<br>begin by<br>making a few comments about studying<br>political science and public policy here<br>at waikato<br>what we offer and what you can expect<br>when taking<br>our papers so political science<br>political science is the study of power<br>and government locally<br>nationally and internationally so it<br>involves things like the study of our<br>democracy<br>in new zealand and we're one of the<br>world's<br>we oldest democracies first country to<br>give women the vote<br>and by and large we're recognised as a<br>reasonably robust<br>democracy and those of us who teach<br>and research on politics in new zealand<br>but generally of the view that we can't<br>take that for granted so we ask<br>questions that will contribute to trying<br>to<br>improve and strengthen democracy in new<br>zealand<br>and globally we see other countries are<br>grappling<br>with a loss of trust in their political<br>systems um<br>a loss of trust in their media and this<br>at a time when<br>you know the world is facing these<br>significant challenges of<br>catch up with the slides guys um most<br>um and this happening at a time when<br>we are dealing with some of the<br>well with significant and major issues<br>um covert 19<br>climate change environmental degradation<br>and you know a new awareness of deep and<br>institutionalized racism through the<br>likes of the black lives<br>matter now most of us don't get to study<br>these kinds of issues until we<br>come most of us don't get to study these<br>kinds of issues through a politics lens<br>until we get to university<br>i don't think we do very well at dealing<br>with civics and political literacy in<br>our secondary school<br>system and it's not until our students<br>take a paper<br>at university that they get to focus<br>closely on these issues<br>as political issues<br>and what studying politics does it<br>increases our capacity<br>to engage with these<br>most important issues of our time and<br>you know contribute to making change in<br>the world<br>so politics degree gives you a good<br>foundation<br>in knowing and understanding what<br>citizenship means<br>how our system of government works laws<br>are made<br>the roles of formal institutions like<br>parliament<br>and cabinet and the media<br>and you know common civic activities<br>like<br>voting<br>so studying politics helps you to<br>develop the knowledge and skills to be<br>an active citizen who's able to<br>participate<br>and how are we doing as a country on<br>this<br>front well we know from a 2019<br>survey that was carried out by seed<br>waikato<br>here in hamilton it's a group of young<br>active hamilton citizens<br>that two out of five<br>young hamiltonians didn't know how to<br>vote in the local<br>government elections last year and 8 out<br>of 10<br>felt quite disconnected from local<br>government<br>so those of us who study and<br>teach political science are generally<br>interested<br>in you know being a part of the solution<br>and you can think of studying politics<br>at one level<br>as providing an advanced civics<br>education<br>so those of us who research<br>and who teach politics at white catto<br>are made up of a group of researchers<br>who do things<br>like study environmental politics and<br>policy<br>climate change international relations<br>gender and ethnic politics<br>political communication and media<br>corruption and politics how we can<br>deepen<br>our democracy and increase our<br>participation<br>and we have the whole security studies<br>field as well so we look at<br>international security issues cyber<br>security<br>different comparative politics so<br>politics of southeast asia or south<br>america<br>and as a group of researchers we ask<br>questions like<br>why are some countries responding more<br>effectively to code<br>what lessons can we learn from other<br>countries<br>and<br>how how might we more effectively<br>respond<br>to international crises like climate<br>change<br>and why is democracy surviving in some<br>countries but<br>becoming weaker than others<br>so our teaching on these kinds of<br>questions<br>is informed by up-to-date research<br>so you can study politics<br>as a major as either a ba<br>or a b sock sign and in a politics major<br>you can<br>focus on the international relations<br>stream<br>which looks at um new zealand's<br>our foreign policy our links with<br>international organizations<br>like the un and nato so you can study<br>that as a stream within a political<br>science major<br>but you can also study that as a minor<br>which involves taking 60 points and<br>specified international relations and<br>you can do the same thing with<br>public policy um so in public policy<br>that's the study of<br>the development and implementation of<br>policy it's kind of a fine-grained look<br>at<br>politics and the politics and policy<br>making<br>as it relates to specific issues like<br>for example<br>health policy or housing policy<br>and the focus on public policy gives you<br>the skills and knowledge to deal with<br>government<br>in your future profession or to work<br>within government<br>or to lobby government as a part of an<br>in the b semester or b trimester as<br>we're calling it now<br>this year we're offering two level one<br>papers<br>uh the first is polls 102 new zealand<br>politics policy this is an introduced<br>introduction to<br>how decisions are made and we cover<br>contemporary policy issues<br>we're also offering via net an<br>introduction to<br>international relations which looks at<br>case studies theories of international<br>relations<br>and contemporary developments in the<br>study of world politics<br>at level two we have four interesting<br>papers and there are no prerequisites<br>for these<br>so we are offering a paper on terrorism<br>in this state a paper on political<br>systems<br>around the world we're offering a paper<br>u.s politics which is particularly<br>which will be interesting given the us<br>presidential elections coming up in<br>november<br>and we all are also offering a paper on<br>i'm the convener of political science<br>and public policy so if you have queries<br>about your undergraduate program don't<br>hesitate to<br>get in touch and i'll just finish with<br>young people are playing a critical role<br>in some of the biggest issues of our<br>time<br>think about the school strike for<br>climate think about the role of<br>young people stepping forward in the<br>black lives matter<br>movement and studying politics as a way<br>of becoming more effective in<br>these kinds of activities<br>know how to to know how influence<br>happens and how to be effective<br>in promoting change and we've got an<br>election<br>in september it's a great time to study<br>politics<br>not really here to sell you our programs<br>but um we're really here to give you<br>information<br>let me finish with the sales but it's a<br>great time to study follow these guys<br>so that's me on political science and<br>public policy here at wake up if you<br>have any questions i can see heaps of<br>questions up here<br>um we can come back to those late but<br>for now lars i'll hand over to you<br>okay thanks patrick it's also a great<br>time to to study geography<br>um i just should point out at the start<br>i mean this panel is made up of all uh<br>males but actually<br>in our um school we actually have a lot<br>of<br>female lecturers is actually probably<br>more than 50 of our staff<br>a woman so so don't don't give me um<br>a false false sense of what we're about<br>based on this panel okay so geography um<br>covers a broad range of topics and i<br>guess that's<br>what we see as our strength is is that<br>broadness i think we think it<br>is really important that geographers uh<br>are able to communicate with a range of<br>professionals<br>political scientists philosophers<br>sociologists<br>but also a lot of physical geographers<br>hydrologists<br>scientists computer scientists and so on<br>because a lot of the problems facing<br>this world are complex<br>if they were simple to to resolve and to<br>come up with solutions uh then they<br>would have they would have<br>been fixed already so a lot of these<br>these problems um<br>uh get debated for for years and uh<br>people are thinking of solutions<br>to them so it's common for a geographer<br>to be working in<br>regional council or local council and<br>working with<br>people from a range of backgrounds and<br>so we<br>in geography think that it's really<br>important that you have<br>a broad uh understanding of a range of<br>topics<br>let's face it you know the world is<br>rapidly changing and uh<br>covert 19 has reminded us of that<br>and uh to resolve these these problems<br>here we do need to have<br>a broad understanding but before covert<br>you know we've had you know climate<br>changes<br>this is going to be wheels for a long<br>time and we've had a lot of issues with<br>uh water quality and i mean these<br>issues are not simple to resolve they<br>evolve both understanding<br>the environment but also understanding<br>uh<br>land use um a lot of the sort of<br>physical side of stuff in terms of<br>hydrology and<br>fertilisers but also you need to think<br>about people's livelihoods<br>and and in jobs and economics<br>so that's what we think is really<br>important that<br>students graduate with a broad range of<br>topics that they understand and uh<br>geography<br>so it's really important that you know<br>people<br>understand a lot of environmental issues<br>uh and<br>and the key concepts associated with the<br>environment but you also need to look at<br>social<br>social issues such as jobs um<br>identity um and well-being and so on<br>and also look at cultural issues and<br>economic<br>issues so it's giving a a<br>broad perspective and being able to talk<br>to people<br>and be part of a team that looks at<br>these<br>issues where we make progress it's also<br>really important that<br>um there are people that can understand<br>both<br>the physical environment as well as<br>as the human environment so geography<br>tries to to bridge<br>bridge there and so we're one of the few<br>disciplines<br>that are actually achieving that um<br>and it's really important that you're<br>able to<br>um apply this knowledge to a wide range<br>of issues it's not just<br>climate change it's not just cobird it's<br>not just crime<br>you don't know what the future is going<br>to bring and you don't know how<br>your job is going to change over over<br>the future i mean you think<br>that people will employ in tourism at<br>the moment something they have to think<br>about uh<br>other jobs i mean government's setting<br>up a lot of jobs in terms<br>of uh job creation so i just<br>talked to a geographer yesterday who was<br>responsible for<br>the 100 million dollar fund for um<br>fencing uh streams so it's a pretty<br>exciting job<br>but that involves quite a um a broad<br>range of knowledge you didn't need<br>to do mapping you need to work with<br>quantitative data you need to<br>talk to farmers you're also talking to a<br>lot of regional councils<br>and politicians and so on so geography<br>does lead<br>to a lot of interesting jobs and you<br>should be when you're planning your<br>degree you should be thinking about<br>being able to be flexible for this<br>changing world and uh<br>you know deal with what the issues that<br>are going to arise<br>so here's a great it's a bit of a<br>confusing group but it shows um<br>those that<br>geographers it shows that geographers uh<br>the um<br>the actual graph says percentage of<br>greater is not employment right so it's<br>not unemployment<br>so actually low is good and so you see<br>uh geographers are<br>the green line there they're the lowest<br>so the dark black line<br>is all of social science<br>uh by the green line you can see that<br>the geographers<br>are most likely to be employed i think<br>that's due to be having that broad<br>okay oops just really um so<br>you need to be this might be uh that<br>chart here on the right might be<br>committed to<br>you need to be able to plan your degree<br>and<br>uh so geography you take two papers at<br>stage one<br>three at uh stage two and<br>um four at um stage three<br>uh so um this year we we've had the<br>environmental society paper that was<br>taught in the semester and so the<br>beastmaster got people in place<br>so these first year papers are very<br>broad in scope uh to cover<br>this broad range of topics<br>um and then you'll see uh in the second<br>year<br>you've you've got a lot of choice there<br>so you can look at we include<br>anthropology<br>including environmental planning we also<br>um through population studies<br>so we've designed the degree so that<br>you've got a lot of flexibility<br>and you get a broad coverage of<br>different subjects<br>uh and in the third year we're sort of<br>showing our specialization that we have<br>in this particular program<br>you've got we've got environmental<br>planning but we've got disasters and<br>development<br>we've got gender gender place and<br>culture so we've got<br>quite a strong uh feminist geography<br>stream um<br>here at waikato we've got indigenous<br>geography so we're quite strong in<br>indigenous geographies here and we also<br>got<br>gis which is which is uh mapping and<br>so there was uh there was a major in<br>geography we also have a binary<br>in gis geographical information systems<br>which is what i'm involved in<br>so this can be part of any degree that<br>you want<br>so your opportunity minors with your<br>degree<br>and you'll see that this is a mix of<br>statistics<br>uh computer science as well as um<br>cartography<br>and uh geographical information systems<br>so lots of jobs<br>uh mapping uh so<br>like you were covered there was lots of<br>maps that you would have seen i actually<br>got involved with the dhb during the um<br>health<br>health um emergency uh they wanted uh<br>someone to<br>max where the covert cases were where<br>the immunisation was<br>so this is gis is quite a important<br>skill<br>it's used a lot by different councils<br>so that's me i'll now hand you over to<br>dan talk about philosophy<br>guys hi everyone so i'm dan bayers i'm<br>the convener<br>and the undergraduate advisor for<br>philosophy so that means if you have any<br>questions about studying philosophy<br>you should come and ask me so what is<br>philosophy<br>it's a subject you don't always come<br>across in high school um<br>a little bit of a spoiler um if you love<br>science philosophy is the father of<br>science<br>or effectively philosophy is the first<br>subject and all of the other subjects<br>spawned out of it now being first<br>doesn't always mean being the best<br>another way of looking at i suppose it's<br>the oldest maybe the least relevant<br>so i'm here to explain a bit more about<br>philosophy<br>and you might even think what is<br>philosophy even doing here this is the<br>social sciences panel i don't see many<br>philosophers going out and doing<br>doing experiments a few of us actually<br>do<br>um and there's another kind of<br>experiment and i'll give you an example<br>of that at the moment it's called a<br>thought experiment<br>it's a very cheap kind of experiment to<br>do so it's quite useful<br>um but like pat said we care about the<br>human element and we care about<br>the certain skills that are shared<br>through the school like critical<br>thinking<br>and so i believe philosophy belongs to<br>be here<br>and and you know i'd like to have a job<br>so what is philosophy i think philosophy<br>is<br>using critical thinking reason and logic<br>to answer the big questions and one of<br>the big questions<br>we can have a look at a few in a moment<br>spoilers for star wars not necessarily<br>who is philosophy for um<br>it's for everyone and by everyone i mean<br>everyone's invited and<br>the greater the amount of diversity we<br>have and our student body is very<br>diverse<br>then the better our classes go the<br>greater the range of opinions the more<br>we can all learn<br>and here's some photos of some<br>philosophers<br>and when i said everyone that wasn't<br>quite right i wanted to be<br>super welcoming if you're not prepared<br>to challenge<br>your existing beliefs including your<br>fundamental deeply held beliefs<br>or if you're not prepared if you're not<br>brave enough to challenge society or<br>challenge others around you<br>in a reason justified way then maybe<br>philosophy is not for you philosophy is<br>a bit dangerous<br>there's every year someone comes in<br>saying<br>man this has really changed everything<br>for me and<br>sometimes it can be unsettling<br>but hopefully for most of you it's just<br>kind of<br>new moments new learning and new growth<br>why is a question that we love we love a<br>lot of questions<br>as philosophers can you smell that it's<br>not a favorite question<br>so it's not just every single question<br>but questions like why<br>the demand a justification they demand<br>reasons and evidence<br>and those kinds of questions seek us out<br>they make us want to learn more they<br>make us want to investigate<br>and challenge and that's why i like that<br>question<br>so you might say well why are we even<br>here<br>um us 19 attendees um you know we could<br>have been<br>still sleeping in there's lots of things<br>we could have been doing it yet here we<br>are<br>well i i'd like to thank that you're<br>here because you have an amazing range<br>of opportunities in front of you<br>and i'm not just talking about these<br>four subjects as the whole of<br>the university there's so many amazing<br>things interesting things<br>useful things you can learn so here's a<br>picture of a bit of a smorgasbord<br>of sweet treats not a sweet tooth maybe<br>that's more up your alley<br>not for the vegetarians though that one<br>but my point is you need to investigate<br>your options<br>i don't know about my fellow panelists<br>but i went through several different<br>degrees several different majors and<br>minors while i was trying to find<br>what was really interesting for me and<br>when i found it it changed the way i<br>studied<br>it was philosophy just changed<br>everything<br>about how much i was learning and what i<br>could do so i do encourage you all<br>to investigate your options you have<br>electives you can take<br>you know you might have your degree<br>sorted out but there are minors that you<br>can add in<br>different subjects so hopefully that's<br>part of what we're doing here<br>i want you to be able to decide for<br>yourselves as i'm sure my fellow<br>panelists do so we're giving you some<br>information<br>occasionally our programs a little bit<br>so philosophy what are you going to<br>learn you're going to learn<br>critical and creative thinking skills<br>now<br>critical thinking skills so how to<br>analyze an argument how to<br>understand when something someone says<br>doesn't even involve an argument doesn't<br>it doesn't include<br>any reasons why you should believe for<br>example<br>so you don't just want to trust<br>authority you like<br>so i'm a lecturer at university you<br>might think i'm an authority figure i'm<br>not really but<br>if you think that then you might think<br>oh i should probably believe what he<br>says because you know he's up there<br>university working away probably doing<br>research sometimes<br>but of course i don't want you to think<br>that i want you to demand<br>reasons and justifications of me like<br>you would of anyone else<br>except for the kind of small occasions<br>where it's an emergency<br>and you don't have time and you know<br>then you might want to<br>listen to an expert without hearing the<br>reasons so we have a few courses that<br>focus<br>specifically on critical thinking and<br>these<br>are ascii 103 a lot of you might have<br>already taken that will be enrolled in<br>that for b-semester<br>rights and reasons so this is learning<br>about the debate<br>the very basics of critical thinking and<br>looking at that through the topic of<br>rights now there's also introduction to<br>logic<br>which is very popular for mathematics<br>and computer science students<br>the idea for logic is you're actually<br>looking through<br>the words and make up an argument<br>looking through those words to structure<br>to the skeleton if you like<br>underneath and if you have a good<br>understanding of the underlying<br>structure of arguments that are<br>effective or ineffective<br>or illogical or not then it helps you<br>when you go back out<br>to the big picture with all the words in<br>to see if that<br>works and then we have another paper<br>fellow 103 which is critical thinking<br>this is available in a b and also i<br>should<br>say g now the net paper the start of<br>summer<br>and this is very skill based<br>so and lots of students find these<br>courses difficult but then very<br>rewarding in the sense that when they<br>turn to any of their other studies they<br>can see how this ability to think<br>critically<br>helps them sort out between the good and<br>the bad arguments what's actually<br>what's not no matter where they go and<br>so critical thinking you might have<br>heard a bit of a buzzword lots of<br>employers are interested in it<br>now i put it to you would you like to<br>have a job for an employer that wants<br>you to have critical thinking skills and<br>to exercise them on the job<br>or not i think all the good jobs<br>one of the number one things they want<br>the critical thinking skills you know<br>they also want good communicators<br>good team players people who are who are<br>honest reliable the critical thinking<br>is right up there those skills<br>so for example rights and reasons might<br>help you<br>understand what jacinda ardern's saying<br>when she says<br>they within their rights to do that that<br>doesn't mean that it's the right thing<br>to do<br>this kind of thing at the first glance<br>you might go what what is she saying<br>what does that mean and it does involve<br>rights and it also involves the ability<br>to work out whether or not something is<br>an argument or not<br>and to analyze whether there's any<br>reasons<br>in philosophy you can also learn to<br>challenge laws and the morals of society<br>and so write some reasons you can get to<br>do a little bit of that<br>are you actually kind of required to do<br>that one of the assessments trying to<br>write something that's challenging and<br>also in philosophy 106 which is social<br>and moral philosophy<br>we go through a range of topics that are<br>kind of significant to society<br>and work out how can we progress<br>in these issues we know that people have<br>a diverse range of views<br>but we also know that we need to have a<br>way to organize this all in our diverse<br>views to move forward and make progress<br>with this<br>and how do we do that are there topics<br>like<br>euthanasia discrimination criminal<br>justice<br>animal welfare that lamb is really cute<br>for example should we eat it<br>um we've also added topics recently like<br>your online life<br>are there some of the things that you do<br>in your online life<br>that actually you shouldn't be doing we<br>don't want to allow other people<br>to do let me give you an example of that<br>in a minute something else you'll learn<br>at philosophy which is to challenge your<br>own fundamental beliefs it's one thing<br>to challenge society but we probably<br>should check in with ourselves first to<br>make sure that we<br>have our own so in both philosophy 106<br>but also philosophy 150 which i'm<br>teaching<br>at b semester i'll be trimester now um<br>the big questions an introduction to<br>philosophy<br>so here every week we look at a<br>different big question and then we try<br>and answer those questions<br>with with reason and and in some<br>subjects<br>the lecturers they tell you his here's<br>the latest<br>here's what you've got to know and if<br>you can understand this you'll do well<br>in philosophy we say here are some<br>skills and some tools<br>now here are some issues that are<br>contemporary issues now let's practice<br>straight away don't you don't have to<br>wait till third year or anything<br>and this year use those tools for<br>yourself<br>on this topic debate with your with your<br>friends your<br>students other students in the class try<br>and work it out for yourself<br>the kind of questions we look at is um<br>should i believe<br>in god as time travel logically possible<br>does my morality apply for you apply to<br>you so imagine<br>we have different moral beliefs we're<br>all being very politically correct and<br>trying not to challenge anyone else's<br>moral beliefs<br>until someone comes along and says well<br>i think it's perfectly fine to burn<br>kittens for fun<br>not sure about that and then and what<br>can we how can we progress with that<br>and we talk about the meaning of life<br>that classic philosophical problems you<br>might as well you need to wait for third<br>year but no<br>i'm going to talk about that in the<br>first year i<br>so i said don't just listen to authority<br>ask for<br>explanations justifications so what i'm<br>going to do is i'm going to give you an<br>example of something that we might talk<br>about<br>in philosophy 106 for example it's an<br>aspect of your online life<br>so it's also an example of a thought<br>experiment where i feel like we can<br>learn things<br>all sitting down in our chairs and just<br>thinking and discussing with each other<br>so here's the game this time lemma oh<br>oh no that's not the game's dilemma<br>sorry about that if you can see that<br>so the game is done everest's so<br>um think about have you ever played a<br>computer game<br>in which you've killed someone you know<br>you've committed a murder basically in a<br>computer game you've killed another<br>avatar at least so in games like<br>fortnite or grand theft auto<br>okay but i asked people in person the<br>vast majority of people have done this<br>and i asked was it morally wrong<br>to kill these you know innocent virtual<br>people<br>and most people say no because it's not<br>morally wrong we'd be doing this as a<br>conversation over a different format<br>it's not morally wrong because you know<br>they're not real that<br>they may they may be controlled by<br>another person but no no<br>real people get harmed it's totally fine<br>okay so now i ask you how many of you<br>have played<br>an online game that's all about<br>pedophilia<br>but then we say well and why not i<br>wouldn't play that game because it's<br>morally wrong it's important<br>you know i would never do that uh and<br>please don't make any judgments about me<br>and what games i play based on this this<br>is<br>but why is it the case that<br>an online game in which miners are<br>sexually assaulted<br>why is it the case that that's morally<br>wrong but then<br>killing innocent people who presumably<br>don't want to be killed online<br>is morally permissible why is one<br>horrible thing in the real world okay in<br>a computer game and another thing that's<br>unless you can think of some important<br>difference between the two<br>you're left in a very strange situation<br>the logic<br>compels you to think of your judgment<br>and because a lot of you probably played<br>these computer games where you kill<br>people a lot<br>it might have a big impact on your life<br>and you might think so<br>it's an example of how philosophy can<br>impact your life<br>but there's more to it than this as we<br>go through these thought experiments we<br>start to think about morality we start<br>to think about what really is acceptable<br>in society or not<br>and why and we get to the point where we<br>try and trade justifications<br>to try and see what really is the kind<br>of thing that can get a whole society to<br>agree<br>on a law or policy okay one more thing<br>you might have i mean i hear this a lot<br>just very quickly<br>you know i meet people in the community<br>and it's a very common joke when they<br>hear a philosopher and they're like oh<br>okay well you got<br>like the one philosophy job in new<br>zealand well done you know all those<br>other poor philosophy graduates<br>are going nowhere um if you come and<br>talk to me i can<br>tell you about this at length i have a<br>website that has a lot of resources on<br>it about this<br>but let me just put it this way a lot of<br>the the complaints are coming<br>from older generations the generations<br>that think you<br>as a student should become a medical<br>doctor a lawyer an accountant<br>these solid professions that are like<br>they're going pay pay dividends for a<br>long time<br>um but actually with artificial<br>intelligence<br>and machine learning those jobs aren't<br>gonna go<br>nearly every aspect of being a lawyer<br>and being a medical doctor and being an<br>accountant are going to be absorbed<br>by machine learning and artificial<br>intelligence and it won't take very long<br>for that to happen<br>so when those super rock steady<br>professional jobs get enough what's left<br>well there still needs to be people who<br>have the critical thinking skills and<br>creative thinking skills and<br>understanding of<br>how things relate to society and broad<br>knowledge the kinds of<br>knowledge and skills you would get from<br>studying social sciences<br>they have to make up the rules for the<br>artificial intelligence<br>and for the machine learning so certain<br>kinds of<br>thinking skills and knowledge will be<br>useful<br>and are ai proof thinking skills<br>now a lot of the subjects where you just<br>learn a bunch of stuff and you have to<br>remember it<br>that stuff changes as science advances<br>and so<br>being able to learn being able to think<br>critically and being agile in your<br>thinking<br>is going to be much more important in<br>i'm sure thank you how much longer i'm<br>gonna have to skip something<br>okay<br>policy program within the division<br>uh and i actually teach criminology<br>that's my background<br>so the program the sociology and social<br>policy program<br>basically offers uh papers in three<br>insulin<br>subject areas one being sociology<br>including<br>criminology uh social policy and gender<br>so because there's three i'm actually<br>going to talk specifically<br>about i can slow down now okay so i've<br>just been given the tens<br>which is cool uh because there are three<br>uh distinct if you like subject areas<br>i'm actually going to focus in on<br>sociology because that's the<br>primarily touch into and i'm going to<br>use criminology particularly the study<br>of crime and deviance as<br>kind of an example if you like of the<br>types of issues that<br>you will be taught to critically analyze<br>and think about within our program<br>so very very briefly sociology is about<br>understanding social issues and social<br>interactions<br>uh with across um human society group<br>subcultures and everyday life<br>um i'd like to sort of support uh what<br>more through my colleagues is especially<br>dan<br>and one of the the focus particularly<br>within the criminology that i teach<br>is to impart to the students the ability<br>to think critically about key<br>social issues right so it's taking a<br>magnifying glass<br>to look at everyday activity or human<br>conduct<br>like for example from deviance<br>so now i'm going to talk about the one<br>area that i know a little bit about<br>okay so the study of crime and cellular<br>criminology actually<br>is a sub-discipline or developed out<br>of the sociology of deviance<br>and one other thing i want to focus here<br>to try and give you an idea of what it<br>is<br>to think critically about key social<br>issues<br>is the distinction between these two<br>interrelated categories deviance and<br>crime<br>so deviance itself is generally we<br>define it as behaving in a way that<br>diverges from usually accepted<br>social standards especially in the<br>social or sexual<br>behavior okay so the sociology of<br>deviation which criminology is a part of<br>we are looking at issues<br>uh much wider than for example crime<br>okay because crime is an actual fact an<br>action or a mission<br>which constitutes an offence and is<br>punishable by law<br>so the category of crime that sits<br>within deviance<br>are those actions or behaviors okay that<br>the state<br>has deemed to be unacceptable and<br>includes it in legislation such as for<br>example new zealand the crimes act<br>and so now for a bit of fun i'm going to<br>show you some slides and ask the<br>question that critical question<br>is a crime or as a deviant<br>just to give you an idea of sort of the<br>complex issues that we deal with so<br>here we have a gentleman i've i've<br>especially i made sure that he was pakia<br>that's a ninja okay now unless it is<br>possible of course that what this<br>gentleman is doing is he's gone for a<br>power walk like<br>that this morning forgot his house keys<br>but i think we can pretty much guess the<br>way he's dressed<br>that he's burglarizing patrick's house<br>because he's seen through the window in<br>his lovely<br>56 inch tv smart tv<br>okay this is a crime under the property<br>section of the crimes act<br>yeah okay so we can accept that as<br>as as a crime although the philosopher<br>might say is it really<br>now this is a deviance or crime this is<br>a gentleman wearing<br>socks with sandals okay which was the<br>uh dress<br>so the clothes of choice when i was<br>growing up in the 70s<br>of all male teachers including at<br>university<br>is it a crime no but it certainly is<br>would be considered<br>a deviant act if for example what i'm<br>guessing most of the people who are<br>listening in here are<br>probably was a generation what are we up<br>to now said just about<br>yeah if one of your friends turned up<br>for a friday night out at my club in<br>hamilton wearing this<br>they or he or she would be excluded from<br>your group immediately<br>okay they would act deviant in the in a<br>way that<br>contravenes the social mores of your<br>particular group it is not a crime or<br>that should be<br>but it is certainly deviant okay and<br>this is the type of critical analysis<br>that we're hoping that you will<br>be able to uh or to be taught to do<br>here we're all about disciplines uh i<br>think ask critical questions yes<br>political science asks well we we we ask<br>the really important ones<br>these guys not so much political science<br>will get you to be able to answer the<br>question why would anyone<br>uh vote for act party uh the geography<br>you'd be able to ask critical questions<br>like when parker came to new zealand why<br>were they so stupid that they started to<br>build all their houses next to flood<br>plains on nature rivers<br>okay and philosophy they're just the<br>white question<br>we in sociology particularly criminology<br>get you to think about the really<br>important questions like why do men wear<br>spares<br>okay that's my attempt at injecting<br>humor into<br>proceedings but we do actually we do<br>actually<br>i actually in australia doing a similar<br>talk i used to have a picture of then<br>tony abbott the prime minister in<br>speedos<br>but i was asked and i'm not making this<br>up by a school chair to take school<br>teacher not to have it<br>because it was too traumatic students<br>but actually putting humor aside we do<br>actually ask i think some really<br>significant<br>questions we all do within criminology<br>and the sociology of deviance<br>we ask why it is that the vast majority<br>of significant or serious gendered<br>violence is<br>done by men against women and against<br>women that they know<br>okay why are the vast majority of those<br>who end up in prison<br>come from a particular group young men<br>um brown and white poor<br>et cetera okay between the ages of<br>around 15 to 35.<br>why why is this the most criminogenic<br>group okay why do women not<br>uh commit so much serious crime these<br>are the significant issues<br>or critical issues that we will focus on<br>and then we get into the real<br>nitty-gritty<br>is this deviance or crime this usually<br>upsets a few people<br>it's quite confidence we have uh a mixed<br>uh marriage or relationship<br>okay and um is it deed is a crime it's<br>certainly not a crime<br>in new zealand context it was until<br>recently<br>for example in many southern states of<br>united uh southern states in america<br>and south africa and even in australia<br>until around the early 1960s with my<br>father's generation<br>where it was okay sex with for pakistan<br>they just could marry them okay however<br>as a deviant when i was 18 years old<br>fell in love with a young woman from a<br>pakia<br>farming community in taranaki when her<br>family found out<br>that she was going out with a maori they<br>put significant pressure on her<br>to drop me which she did never got over<br>it<br>okay so not a crime but certainly even<br>within my generation<br>okay so in certain groups interracial<br>relationships uh anathem<br>okay and for your generation this is not<br>a crime but it definitely bloody should<br>be<br>okay all these people stand we're<br>walking around looking at their phones<br>they keep walking into me as they get<br>out of there out of the lift<br>and i wear 100 kilos it's not a very<br>safe thing to do<br>okay okay i'm trying to rush through<br>this i'm not going to talk about<br>specific papers<br>if you want to have a look at the type<br>of papers that we are<br>offering through one years one to three<br>you can go into our web page and have a<br>look at that<br>i want to do the plug okay so what<br>uh can would you be able to do with a<br>degree for example in sociology<br>lots of things particularly if you come<br>and do my fantastic criminology papers<br>all right a lot of our students in this<br>area go into research and advocacy work<br>and community organizations of their<br>students go and work<br>also for international uh if you like<br>human rights organizations okay<br>a lot of our students go into even<br>planning to do social impact assessments<br>for local government<br>some go into market research and a lot<br>of the students go into what i call<br>social development which is working for<br>central local government agencies<br>generally in the sort of social policy<br>sector<br>okay and of course those who do<br>criminology<br>uh if you're this way inclined can go<br>into probation or corrections<br>police social activist organizations<br>international social policy<br>social policy draws on a range of<br>disciplines such as political science it<br>has a very significant relationship with<br>uh political science and sociology to<br>help us understand the following<br>how different parts of our society<br>including government provide resources<br>and services<br>that supposedly or should enhance the<br>well-being of individuals<br>and groups and in our community what and<br>also why systems<br>of work the way that they do i mean<br>governmental systems health education<br>employment welfare and retirement and i<br>think that it also<br>again want to underline i think the cool<br>thing that's gone through our<br>presentations<br>of critical thinking we get you to<br>critically analyze these systems<br>all right analyze question everything<br>question<br>the statements okay the claims that are<br>made by policymakers<br>by politicians by ministers of<br>government about whether or not a policy<br>the way they're spending our money<br>is in actual fact the best<br>way of assisting the social development<br>or providing social support<br>particularly to the most needy in our<br>communities<br>okay and social policy career path is<br>pretty much similar to<br>we have this really interesting stream<br>of gender and sexualities<br>which is concerned with understanding<br>gender and gender diversity<br>within new zealand and the international<br>community<br>focused very much on key issues for<br>women in new zealand and internationally<br>as well<br>and it does so by exploring issues like<br>around gender roles immediate<br>representation of gender<br>uh key issues around like for example<br>paid an unpaid work<br>one of the core issues that's been one<br>of my colleagues is studying at the<br>moment<br>is this thing called the glass ceiling<br>okay why does that<br>in the boardrooms around new zealand<br>within the private sector<br>there's only about i think 15 to 20<br>woman and you make up 51 of the<br>population<br>so these are some type of critical<br>issues that we address<br>and again the careers are often in<br>policy analysis women's rights research<br>and advocacy<br>etc etc<br>that's it from me thank you very much<br>for listening thank you to my colleagues<br>thanks there's a question that's come<br>through if you have another question<br>please um<br>type it in now so that the question is<br>um about what we're doing with our<br>future courses and online courses so<br>all of the courses in b trimester at the<br>university of wyoming<br>are going to have options for doing them<br>online including<br>asynchronous options meaning if you're<br>not there at exactly the right time<br>you still get to watch at least what's<br>going on<br>there will also be opportunities for<br>interaction<br>but some of those opportunities for<br>interaction a lot of those are going to<br>depend on<br>being available at exactly the right<br>time there's a range of different ways<br>we're doing it<br>but for net papers<br>there's going to be a range and for hand<br>papers<br>there's going to be a range as well so<br>if you're in another country<br>it shouldn't matter too much there may<br>be some certain elements that<br>you can't engage with live but there'll<br>be a big range of elements so you should<br>still get a quality<br>perhaps while you're well while you're<br>banging it out just fire a quick<br>question to pat um so most people<br>young people that i've met seemed to say<br>why should i care about politics because<br>they're all corrupt and<br>just how to serve themselves there's no<br>one worth voting for no one represents<br>me<br>so why bother<br>that's one view of politics and there<br>has been this um<br>well-known vlogger in new zealand he's<br>somewhat diminished force at the moment<br>cameron slater<br>he had he ran the whale oil blog but it<br>has been shut down<br>a year or so ago but he used to say i<br>played politics<br>like fijians play rugby able to smash<br>your face into the ground<br>which which is a view of politics as a<br>as a combative um doggy dog<br>influences how we distribute power in<br>society<br>i think my view of politics is<br>much more as a creative endeavor<br>where we as interested<br>and active citizens seek to work<br>together in creative ways to solve the<br>critical problems that we face<br>like climate change like environmental<br>degradation<br>like poverty these are wicked problems<br>that are multi-causal that need<br>the input from all of us and<br>i think the study of politics well i<br>think viewing politics<br>in that different way<br>provides much more uh<br>promise for dealing with some of these<br>critical issues<br>so that's a genuine answer to i think is<br>what i think is quite a legitimate view<br>that<br>when someone wants to study politics<br>it's this dark uh<br>and yet it's often not until people do<br>take a course that they see<br>the potential thanks pat well our time's<br>up so thanks very much<br>everyone for tuning in and if you do<br>have more questions you can just follow<br>us up here<br>online or come into the campus and see<br>us um and hopefully we will see you<br>around and be trimester so</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
