We're all <br>looking forward to having listened to you talk,  <br>and as we heard from the last couple <br>of Fast Forward presentations,  <br>Phil was quite happy to take <br>questions for the floor,<br>so please use the chat function and <br>what we'll do is we'll have about a  <br>25–30-minute presentation from Phil, then I <br>might just ask a few questions as the chair,<br>and then I'll take questions from the floor <br>which we've got about 30 minutes of space.<br>So, it's really good - so it's a good opportunity  <br>for you to sit and have a chat and <br>ask the minister some questions.<br>So, without further ado, thanks again, <br>Phil. I really appreciate the time,  <br>and I'll pass the floor over to you, <br>and then we'll go into some Q&amp;A if  <br>that's alright with you.<br>Yes, indeed. Thanks, Lee,  <br>and thank you to the School of Architecture <br>and Planning for this opportunity.<br>I always love talking with people about urban <br>development and the future of our cities,  <br>and I've been looking forward to this evening.<br>So, what I'm going to do is talk about <br>the Urban Development Bill that's before  <br>the Parliament right now and will be <br>passed in the next few weeks into law,<br>then, I also want to talk a little bit about the <br>broader urban agenda that the government has <br>and talk about some of the things that <br>we've been doing in other areas as well.<br>So first, I think that there - the question <br>that we have to really address is, you know,  <br>why is our government the first government <br>in New Zealand to have a Minister of Urban  <br>Development and develop a whole <br>reform agenda around our cities?<br>And I suppose allied to that is the question:  <br>why our cities and why is urban development <br>important to New Zealand right now?<br>We've got a lot of other things on our plate.<br>People will have noticed.<br>So, where do cities fit into all that?<br>The answer, I think, to both those questions is <br>simply because our cities are not doing very well.<br>They are not performing as they should,  <br>and we can see that the evidence is <br>right in front of us on a daily basis.<br>Auckland is perhaps the most egregious example, <br>but there are many others where our cities,  <br>which are small by international standards, and <br>yet, they really struggle with urban mobility.<br>The transport networks are not working properly, <br>and they suffer often chronic traffic congestion,  <br>and that's a really good indication that <br>things aren't working as well as they should.<br>We also have had and we for the <br>last decade really and even before,  <br>we've been in the grip of a <br>housing crisis where we have  <br>failed as a society to decently and <br>properly house too many of our people.<br>Housing is too expensive.<br>It's in short supply.<br>It's treated as a - like an investment <br>commodity instead of a great place to live,  <br>and we're pouring vast amounts <br>of our national wealth into  <br>buying and selling houses rather than <br>actually generating real prosperity.<br>And the third point really is <br>that particularly Auckland as  <br>amongst our cities suffers from low productivity.<br>Given Auckland's size and proportion within <br>our country, it should be doing a lot better  <br>in terms of productivity and my argument to <br>you tonight is that the failure to address the  <br>challenges in the built environment, particularly <br>around transport and housing and good urban  <br>planning one of the reasons why Auckland's <br>productivity is lower than it should be.<br>Transport and housing costs have risen very <br>quickly over the last decade in Auckland in  <br>a way that we haven't seen in any other <br>of the comparable Australasian cities.<br>So, that's the - that's my problem definition, <br>but we should be doing so much better.<br>You know, cities all around the world are engines  <br>of growth and productivity and <br>magnets for investment and talent.<br>If our cities aren't working properly, <br>then we need to do something about it.<br>We need to lift our game.<br>And so, our government has developed a <br>- what we call our Urban Growth Agenda,  <br>and I'll talk a bit about the different <br>parts of that agenda this evening.<br>It's in - it's designed to, in the first <br>instance, get government to lift its game  <br>for us to do better and to contribute to much <br>better, more prosperous and thriving cities.<br>We want to reform the planning system <br>and the way that we fund and finance  <br>the infrastructure that allows our cities to grow,<br>and we want to create an environment where <br>all of the other actors, the private sector,  <br>the design professions, local government, <br>iwi, and the broader community can all  <br>contribute to this vision of thriving <br>and prosperous and sustainable cities.<br>So, I'll come back to those other elements <br>in the Urban Growth Agenda a little later,<br>but I wanted to talk a bit more tonight about the  <br>Urban Development Bill that is <br>currently before the Parliament.<br>Now, Urban Development Authorities - UDAs they're <br>sometimes called - but basically, you know,  <br>purpose-designed public entities to facilitate <br>urban development or urban regeneration.<br>They've been part of the landscape <br>internationally for much of the 20th century,<br>and in Australia, since the Whitlam <br>years and in the early to mid-1970s,  <br>they've been a feature of the <br>larger Australian state capitals.<br>But New Zealand has been rather late to the party,  <br>and the reason I think is that our cities just <br>haven't been big enough or growth rates fast  <br>enough to force us to confront the quite tricky <br>challenges of second-generation urban growth.<br>The first generation of growth for <br>our cities was really a sort of,  <br>what I call a kind of mid-20th century <br>or early 20th-century pattern of  <br>development based around the private car and <br>motorways and low-rise suburban expansion.<br>But when cities reach a certain scale, spatial <br>economics mean that land gets more expensive  <br>when you have more people together, <br>particularly in the centre of cities,<br>and it means that we must use land, and the market <br>drives us really to use land more efficiently.<br>Hence the drive for urban intensification, <br>particularly in places we, you know,  <br>where people want to live, and that <br>might be access to jobs or amenities.<br>Now, transport also becomes more of a challenge.<br>We have to move more people with fewer vehicles.<br>Hence the need now for more <br>walking and cycling infrastructure,  <br>for better public transport, <br>for rapid transit networks,<br>but also, we need to meet the <br>demand of people to live close  <br>to where the jobs are and where the amenities are.<br>Again, it takes us back to this <br>drive for urban intensification.<br>Now, there have been some examples <br>of publicly led urban development  <br>projects or urban regeneration projects <br>in New Zealand, and I thought I'd just  <br>mention a few of them. And they are all <br>things that we can learn lessons from.<br>You know, back in the 1960s, the Holyoake <br>government land banked hundreds of hectares  <br>of land on Auckland's North Shore to build a new <br>city, a new university, a new city in Albany,  <br>and this was the vision of a planned <br>community to assist the city's expansion.<br>Unfortunately, in the early 90s, <br>the National government of the day,  <br>and Murray McCully was the Minister of Housing,  <br>sold off that land with a sweetheart <br>mortgage deal to a Singapore-based company, <br>and the vision of a planned mixed-use <br>development in a new city was lost.<br>And the Albany that we have <br>today is sadly a result of that.<br>There are some happier stories, though.<br>Hobsonville Point, which was started <br>under the Clark government in response  <br>to really trying to address Auckland's <br>growing pains and housing pressures,  <br>was overseen by a subsidiary of Housing New <br>Zealand called the Hobsonville Land Company.<br>And while Labour has always complained <br>that John Key, as Prime Minister,  <br>stripped out most of the affordable <br>housing and all the state housing,  <br>there's no question that Hobsonville Point <br>has been in many ways commercially successful,  <br>and it has demonstrated a new way <br>of building whole new communities.<br>The old way Waitakere City in New Lynn <br>made a pretty decent stab, I think,  <br>at a transit-oriented development in New <br>Lynn by undergrounding the railway tracks  <br>with a cut and cover trench, and zoning <br>for urban regeneration in the town centre,  <br>investing in civic amenity and allowing <br>for high-rise apartments and the like.<br>Both Wynyard Quarter and the Wellington <br>waterfront, I think, are really good examples of  <br>local government repurposing and regenerating old <br>port land and turning it into a pretty fabulous  <br>public space, and also commercial and retail <br>space and residential that we can point to.<br>And the other, I think, really other - really <br>good example is Auckland Council's work at  <br>the Britomart, which a generation ago, I <br>remember as a youngster was a pretty dodgy  <br>and awful and decrepit part of downtown Auckland,<br>and now it's a wonderful, wonderful neighbourhood.<br>What we want to do is learn from <br>those exercises and attempts at  <br>urban development and scale-up what we're doing<br>- to do more, to do it <br>faster, and to do it better.<br>And that's the vision that underpins <br>the creation of Kāinga Ora,  <br>our government's Housing and <br>Urban Development Agency.<br>It's a kind of delivery agency, a bit <br>like NZTA Waka Kotahi is for transport.<br>Kāinga Ora is our delivery agency for urban <br>development and the built environment.<br>And we also want to partner with others, with the <br>private sector, with iwi and local government,<br>and create a competitive effect of more and  <br>more high-quality urban development and <br>urban regeneration projects that will,  <br>over the decades to come, reshape and <br>redesign the face of urban New Zealand.<br>So you might be wondering, <br>well, why do we need this law?<br>Why do we need an agency like <br>Kāinga Ora to do this work?<br>And the fact is that urban regeneration,  <br>particularly on brown and grey fields sites, <br>is intrinsically challenging and complex.<br>You've often got great <br>fragmentation of land title.<br>You might have old and out-of-date <br>network infrastructure, like the  <br>pipes that carry the water under the ground.<br>The roads might be in the wrong places.<br>There might be parks and reserves that  <br>are in the wrong places and are <br>blocking a certain development.<br>There may be the RMA plans,  <br>the zoning and rules in the local plan <br>may not be conducive to development.<br>And all of these things often add up <br>to so much risk and uncertainty that  <br>the private sector cannot attempt grey <br>or brownfields development at scale.<br>And so often, it just doesn't happen.<br>And so what we've tried to do with <br>establishing Kāinga Ora and with designing  <br>this new legislation, the Urban Development <br>Bill is to create an organisation and a set  <br>of powers that is able to cut through some of this <br>complexity to bring forward development projects  <br>that might otherwise take a decade to happen <br>and allow them to happen much more quickly.<br>And here's the really important thing <br>- to deliver and in the final instance  <br>much better urban outcomes, stronger <br>communities, a better-built environment.<br>And I should also say that <br>we've done this with, I think,  <br>a vision that is quite different to the way that <br>this kind of work is often done internationally.<br>In Australia, I mentioned that in places <br>like New South Wales and Victoria,  <br>they've used urban development authorities often <br>redevelop old port land or railway land and so on.<br>The approach the Australians often take is to <br>say, “here's the land, here's the contract,  <br>knock yourself out. Go and stimulate the economy, <br>create some jobs and then come back to us.”<br>Now, there's obviously a <br>role for urban development  <br>and stimulating the economy and creating jobs.<br>But we see the really pressing need in New <br>Zealand is to build our collective capability,  <br>to build really fantastic communities that <br>people will want to live and work and play in.<br>And so the mandate and the vision for <br>Kāinga Ora to do these large-scale urban  <br>projects is very strongly anchored in <br>a vision of what's in the public good.<br>So what does that mean?<br>We want to see mixed-use developments that include  <br>housing and residential and <br>commercial developments.<br>We want jobs to be close to where people live.<br>We want these communities to be <br>really well served by transport  <br>infrastructure, including the kind of <br>multimodal transport that is Auckland's future.<br>We want really great walking and cycling <br>neighbourhoods and these communities to  <br>be connected to walking and cycling <br>networks that crisscross the city.<br>We want them to be within walking <br>distance of high quality frequent  <br>public transport and preferably rapid transit.<br>So we want these communities to <br>have the best of urban design  <br>in their neighbourhoods and the spaces <br>in between the buildings. We want to be  <br>friendly and safe and supportive of the <br>kind of lives that people want to live.<br>So that's a, I think, a very particular  <br>vision about what makes for strong <br>communities and successful cities.<br>So what is that? What does the <br>Urban Development Bill say?<br>It effectively brings together in one organisation <br>and in one piece of legislation all of the powers  <br>that currently reside only with local government <br>and that are currently scattered across numerous  <br>pieces of legislation or passed at all different <br>times of our country's history that often  <br>make it very difficult for local government to <br>exercise all those powers in a streamlined way.<br>So the kind of powers that I'm talking about are <br>the powers to reconfigure network infrastructure.<br>So Kāinga Ora, under this <br>legislation, for instance,  <br>will be able to reconfigure the roads <br>and the walking and cycling pathways.<br>It will be able to redesign the <br>pipes, the network of pipes that  <br>distribute the three waters: water to <br>the tap, stormwater and wastewater.<br>It will have the powers, although I'll come <br>back to the sort of checks and balances that  <br>we put around it, but it will have the <br>powers to reconfigure parks and reserves.<br>We believe strongly that communities <br>need public spaces and open spaces,  <br>access to streams and waterways <br>and the natural environment.<br>So Kāinga Ora will have the <br>ability to take all that into  <br>account as it shapes these new developments.<br>It will have the ability to acquire <br>land under the Public Works Act.<br>Now, this is quite a sensitive and controversial <br>issue, the use of the Public Works Act.<br>In New Zealand, we habitually use the Public  <br>Works Act to acquire land for the <br>building of roads and motorways.<br>But we've never really had a history of using <br>the Public Works Act to acquire land for urban  <br>development to build buildings, let alone new <br>communities that include privately-owned housing.<br>So we haven't extended those powers.<br>They've already, they've <br>always existed in New Zealand.<br>But in fact, we have put some <br>limits and controls around the  <br>exercise of the acquisition of <br>land for development projects.<br>But it is our firm belief that if you're going <br>to do these kind of large-scale developments,  <br>you must at least have access to those <br>powers of acquisition in your back pocket  <br>to avoid people blocking developments <br>in order to make a windfall gain.<br>But it's my judgment at least that in New Zealand,  <br>there would be very little tolerance <br>or social license for the wholesale  <br>acquisition of privately owned land under the <br>Public Works Act to support Urban Development.<br>The new act will also give Kāinga Ora, for <br>the purpose of these large-scale projects,  <br>it will give it - basically the RMA consenting <br>powers so that within the boundaries of what we  <br>call under the bill a “specified development <br>project,” Kāinga Ora will be able to redesign  <br>the zoning and the planning that currently <br>would exist within the district plan or in  <br>Auckland's case, the Auckland Unitary Plan <br>around the needs of the of the project.<br>So that's a lot of powers in one place, and <br>we're very conscious that these powers will  <br>need to be exercised with a great <br>deal of responsibility and care.<br>There are a number of checks and balances <br>with these, the exercise of these powers,  <br>including that certain decisions have to be <br>then ultimately signed off at cabinet level.<br>So you've got that democratic accountability.<br>To give you an example, any exercise of these <br>powers around the reconfiguration of packs  <br>and reserves ultimately gets signed <br>off by the Minister of Conservation.<br>We've put it - we've designed a process for <br>the formulation and the development and the  <br>decision-making around these large scale projects <br>that was in part inspired by the success of  <br>Auckland Council in using an Independent Hearings <br>Panel to produce the Auckland Unitary Plan.<br>And the key principles I think <br>have been the front-loading of  <br>public engagement right at the beginning <br>of the process, the ability for anybody to  <br>make a submission on a proposed plan and an <br>Independent Hearings Panel with Environment  <br>Court judges or retired Environment Court <br>judges on it making those decisions.<br>And then appeals on matters <br>of law and judicial review.<br>So very important to enshrine the public's right <br>to have a say, for all stakeholders and any public  <br>interest to want to be able to critique or make <br>counter proposals on a plan, and then ultimately  <br>you've got an experienced judicial practitioner <br>if you like on a panel that makes those decisions.<br>So that's really the guts of it, and it's our hope <br>that when passed into law in the next few weeks,  <br>this new legislation will be able to <br>be used to facilitate and support the  <br>implementation of a new generation of <br>large-scale urban development projects.<br>In designing the legislation, we have <br>really put a great deal of emphasis  <br>on these new powers and exercised by <br>Kāinga Ora as a kind of joint venture  <br>vehicle for partnerships to deliver <br>these urban development projects.<br>It is not our intention or our vision that <br>government basically takes over the space of urban  <br>development, central government does it all, takes <br>over these projects and exercises these powers.<br>The legislation has been drafted so that - and <br>we anticipate this will be probably more often  <br>than not - these large-scale projects will <br>be initiated and governed and implemented  <br>by partnerships that could include local <br>government, local government development agencies,  <br>like in Auckland, Panuku; and others: <br>private sector developers, iwi and others.<br>And so, we wanted to be an enabling tool for all <br>of those key development actors to do things.<br>And I don't - I'm sure there'll be somewhere <br>where the government through Kāinga Ora may lead  <br>particular developments, but I suspect a lot of <br>them will be joint ventures with local councils.<br>I know that there are many <br>councils who are champing  <br>at the bit to use this legislation <br>to undertake development projects,  <br>and I know that there are many in the private <br>sector who also see this as a real opportunity.<br>So let me start to conclude by really <br>just putting the Urban Development Act,  <br>or Bill as it is now, in the <br>context and by mentioning some  <br>of the other things that are part <br>of our urban development agenda.<br>So one of the first things that we did on <br>becoming the government was really, we realised  <br>that the government really had very little <br>capacity in this area of urban development,<br>and so I established the Ministry <br>of Housing and Urban Development.<br>So we brought bits of the public service that <br>were scattered over multiple departments and  <br>ministries into one government ministry <br>designed to provide central government  <br>leadership in the whole area of <br>housing and urban development.<br>We also then created Kāinga Ora,  <br>the agency that will exercise the special <br>development powers we've been talking about.<br>It's also inherited Housing New <br>Zealand, their 25 billion dollar  <br>asset base and the job of running New <br>Zealand’s state housing programme.<br>And also into it has gone that was <br>the Hobsonville Land Company (HLC)  <br>and the KiwiBuild procurement unit working with <br>developers to get more affordable housing built.<br>So that's the first thing, built <br>the capacity of government.<br>Secondly, we're also passing legislation in the  <br>next few weeks to create new ways of <br>funding and financing infrastructure.<br>One of the reasons our towns struggle <br>to grow is that councils can't borrow  <br>any more money to build the roads and the <br>pipes, and therefore growth doesn't happen.<br>That drives up the price of urban land <br>and housing and blocks developments,  <br>so we've brought in a new way of <br>funding and financing infrastructure.<br>We are shortly to unveil a new National <br>Policy Statement on Urban Development.<br>This is a policy instrument under <br>the RMA, and it's the way that  <br>governments articulate from the national <br>interest and give guidance to councils.<br>And our National Policy Statement on Urban <br>Development will do, amongst other things,  <br>will mandate councils to free <br>up the planning rules around  <br>intensification and require them to <br>allow much more urban intensification,  <br>particularly in town centres, city centres and <br>along public transport routes and interchanges.<br>It's also going to ban parking minima, <br>which currently in many New Zealand town  <br>plans is - district plans - is requirements <br>for developers to put and build so many care  <br>parks every time they build an apartment <br>or a house or a commercial premises.<br>And that has a terribly distorting <br>effect on urban land economics,  <br>drives up the price of housing <br>and undermines public transport.<br>We've also been working on couple years <br>on regional spatial planning partnerships  <br>with Tāmaki Makaurau, with Hamilton, the whole <br>Waikato corridor, Tauranga and the Bay of Plenty,  <br>the Wellington region, Canterbury and Queenstown.<br>And these are partnerships between central <br>government, multiple councils, iwi, with a  <br>30-year horizon planning transport, <br>housing, infrastructure and growth.<br>And driving many of the things that <br>I've been talking about this evening:  <br>more urban intensification, <br>a more multimodal approach  <br>to transport investment, reform of <br>the planning and the zoning system.<br>RMA reform, my colleague David Parker has <br>a full-throated reform of the RMA underway.<br>Part of that is the urban side, and some of the <br>things that I've been talking about in the last  <br>20 minutes really will be reflected in the RMA <br>reforms that will emerge over the next year or so.<br>And then the final element really <br>is a much tougher integration of  <br>transport investment and planning <br>with housing and urban development.<br>and you can see that in Wellington, ‘Let's <br>Get Wellington Moving’, our 6.8 billion  <br>dollar plan to build rapid transit, more <br>walking and cycling in Wellington City,  <br>and create corridors where an urban <br>development authority under the new  <br>legislation can deliver the kind of urban <br>intensification in a rapid transit corridor.<br>Same vision for light rail in Auckland.<br>Creating a corridor of high-frequency rapid  <br>transit and then allowing quality urban <br>intensification along that corridor.<br>So just a final comment, I think that the <br>country is really ready for modernising the  <br>way that we grow our towns and cities. My <br>hope is that with the kind of reforms that  <br>I've been talking about tonight, including <br>the new Urban Development Act, which will  <br>allow these large-scale projects to proceed, <br>that it will generate a competitive effect.<br>Towns and cities and will be competing <br>to do inspiring development projects.<br>And what it will do over the years to <br>come is really reshape our towns and  <br>cities for a more sustainable and <br>inclusive, and productive future.<br>So Lee, thank you for patiently listening  <br>while all that was going on and <br>I look forward to questions.<br>Thanks, Phil. That was fantastic.<br>I mean, there was just so many things <br>that you just gone through in such a  <br>short period of time, and we have a range <br>of questions I'll get to in a moment.<br>But just starting off another question, <br>I'd like to, I think we were sort of  <br>discussing this before, is in light of <br>where we've been and with the lockdown  <br>and everything like that, how do <br>you see that as having an impact?<br>A lot of what you've talked about is <br>you know TOD oriented development,  <br>intensification and I would <br>argue, return to the local.<br>How do you see the public's mood and how do <br>you see that playing out in light of where  <br>we've been and what you're proposing now in the <br>space we've been in the last couple of months?<br>This is an interesting international debate <br>that's going on right now about the future  <br>of cities in the time of COVID, and <br>if I had to take a bet on it, Lee,  <br>I would say that the forces of urbanisation which <br>are so powerful and have been going on for 150  <br>years and have another hundred years to go in <br>the estimates of a lot of thinkers in this area,<br>I think those forces are so powerful. I don't <br>think that COVID, as large as it's looming in  <br>our consciousness right now, is going to set <br>back or reverse that process of urbanisation.<br>I think we'll learn to live with these pandemics.<br>But I think that they, yeah, I mean I think <br>and we were saying before we joined the Zoom,  <br>Lee, that there was an interesting <br>article in The Economist recently  <br>about whether megacities like New York, <br>who have been so devastated by COVID-19,  <br>whether this will make people reluctant to come <br>into the city to work and to play and everything.<br>It's an interesting question. But I think <br>in New Zealand if anything, it's caused us  <br>to reflect on our neighbourhoods, on the kind <br>of quality of life, and that's a good thing.<br>I think that the pressure and the <br>imperative that we feel right now  <br>to build more successful cities that people can <br>move around freely, that are more prosperous,  <br>where people have quality warm, dry, <br>well-designed homes and neighbourhoods;  <br>access to jobs; I think these are very <br>powerful things that aren't going to go away.<br>Just being able to talk about the UDAs, and you <br>talked about obviously the role of Kāinga Ora,  <br>and so, it's like you talked about the balance <br>sheet that Housing New Zealand has, is that  <br>part of their ability to finance the process <br>is using that balance sheet to finance that?<br>So, I mean, people will know that our government's <br>very strongly committed to public housing.<br>State housing and working with community <br>housing providers is really part of our DNA.<br>Kāinga Ora is already borrowing a lot of money <br>against its balance sheet, and so, in order to  <br>build, we've just announced another 8000 state <br>houses that we're building at the moment.<br>So, we're working that balance sheet pretty hard,  <br>so there isn't a lot of money hanging around <br>to throw into these new large-scale projects.<br>But we don't need the government to come with a <br>war chest of money to do this all the time. Yep,  <br>sure, time and again, we've got to find money <br>in the transport budget to build road or rail.<br>You know, in January, we announced two and <br>a half-billion dollars for road and rail to  <br>allow a new town the size of Napier to be <br>built at Drury around two railway stations.<br>It's a great example of transit <br>oriented development, actually,  <br>on the edge of the city, but these <br>people when the City Rail Link’s built,  <br>those people are going to have a half-hour <br>electric commuter train ride to the Britomart.<br>So yup, central government does <br>have to be willing to fund things,  <br>but we also should bring in partners <br>and Auckland Council - in Auckland,  <br>Auckland Council and Panuku are the obvious <br>partners, and they have a lot of land and assets.<br>So one last question before I pass over <br>- I've got quite a few from the floor,  <br>which is fantastic and please <br>keep those coming through.<br>Just in terms of how the actual UDA would <br>actually work, so if I understand correctly,  <br>what you're saying is it would <br>take away those plan making,  <br>consenting and building consent <br>powers from the council.<br>So how does that relationship then <br>work on the interface between the  <br>council and the UDA space? How does <br>that play out, and how does that work?<br>So in the process of developing plans, the <br>development entity that would be set up  <br>for a specific project, say, is required <br>to consult with the council and others.<br>I expect that in many if not most cases,  <br>councils will be active partners <br>in these new development projects,  <br>so they will be investors, developers and will <br>have seats on the boards of these entities.<br>They will have the ability to do them themselves,  <br>councils will have the ability to set up these <br>projects and do them even without partners,  <br>and there are various checks and balances that <br>are built into the process of developing and  <br>agreeing a project plan that require councils to <br>be consulted and their views taken into account.<br>I'll give you one example. If one of these urban <br>development entities was to redesign the network  <br>infrastructure, let's say, the three waters for <br>a project, it would not be fair or reasonable  <br>for them to design that in a certain way that <br>didn't fit the wider networks the council runs,  <br>and then at the end of the project hand <br>those pipes back to the council in a way  <br>that they might be of inferior quality or <br>alternatively gold-plated and too expensive.<br>So there are - we've designed into the <br>legislation the necessity for those  <br>things to be kind of worked out to a mutual <br>agreement. But it's true, it's truly that these  <br>entities will have the ability to rewrite the <br>zoning rules, for instance, to allow for more  <br>intensification or more height in a particular <br>area that might vary from the district plan.<br>I think I’ll take a question from the <br>floor. I got here one from Ben van Bruggen.<br>He says, “in many examples you've <br>mentioned, in many countries,  <br>there's a strong urban design legislation <br>and government champions for good design.”<br>“We have governments with design departments. <br>When will we see New Zealand - when will we see  <br>central government's design quality <br>unit established in New Zealand?”<br>And I think the UDF - I’m putting my hand up as <br>I've been a member of the Urban Design Forum.  <br>I'm sure we’ve hassled you about this <br>before. So any more thoughts on that?<br>Yeah, so Ben and many other colleagues have <br>been very good advocates on this issue,  <br>and I'm the first to admit that our <br>reforms in this first three-year  <br>period have been very much focused <br>on building institutional capacity,  <br>trying to create a legislative framework <br>for more urban development and addressing  <br>the kind of supply and demand aspects of <br>the urban land market and housing market.<br>Because I think that's what needed to be done in <br>the first instance. But I absolutely recognised  <br>that if we are if we want to look back and you <br>know 20 years’ time or 30 years’ time and say,  <br>“Hey, we made a difference when we did <br>all these reforms and together government,  <br>councils, community, the design <br>professions, we really lifted New  <br>Zealand’s game and the way we build our <br>cities,” then design is central to it.<br>We've got to build homes that in 50 <br>years’ time or 100 years’ time people  <br>will be proud to live in, that are <br>healthy and give people the kind of  <br>lifestyle they want. We've got to have <br>really great transport infrastructure.<br>We want to reduce carbon emissions. <br>We want people to have access to open  <br>spaces. We want buildings that are really <br>well designed and functional and beautiful.<br>So, I think there's a great debate to be had, <br>and I think we've started having it about how  <br>you engender a better design sensibility <br>when it comes to the built environment.<br>And I'm kind of very open to the next phase, <br>really, of reforms, looking at what we might do,  <br>and it may be legislation. There may <br>be some policy instrument. It may be  <br>that we need people in Kāinga Ora and the <br>Ministry of Housing and Urban Development  <br>who champion good design and are kind of <br>the guardians and the advocates for design.<br>I haven't been able to kind of get to that stuff <br>in this first three-year period because we've  <br>had a very, very busy agenda, but I don't <br>need much convincing that it's a good idea.<br>And I think you can see in Auckland Council, the <br>Auckland Design Office over a certain period of  <br>time, it really raised the public debate around <br>design, the use of design panels, a lot of good  <br>public advocacy, some real success stories <br>there, I think that we can learn from that.<br>We've got a question - <br>anonymous, a bit unfortunate. <br>“Attempts to increase quality of housing <br>has so far somewhat been lacklustre,  <br>and there's been little change in housing <br>affordability. Are there any other means by  <br>which you see us being able to change <br>our society's views on housing? Is it  <br>something that its interest really increases <br>the value despite its utility to the owner…”<br>Well, basically, talking about value, <br>capturing value of housing is basically what  <br>he’s talking about. And you know what I'm <br>saying, so what do you think about that?<br>Well I think we have made some progress on this.<br>Our government has nailed its colours to  <br>the mast very strongly on wanting <br>to address housing affordability.<br>We have built, in the last three years, <br>we've built more public housing than  <br>the last National government <br>did over nine years. In fact,  <br>they reduced - if they had built at the same rate <br>we are, there would be no shortage of housing,  <br>state housing. There'd be no waiting list.<br>So we've done that. We have banned foreign  <br>buyers from buying New Zealand homes and <br>bidding up the price of New Zealand homes.<br>We've shut down the tax breaks for <br>property investors that fuelled  <br>the kind of Ponzi scheme of housing that we <br>saw at the top of the cycle more recently.<br>So we've done those things. We've had some very <br>well publicised difficulties with KiwiBuild,  <br>which you know, I was at the forefront of and took <br>a lot of, I should say, a lot of hide off my back,  <br>really struggling with that policy, which was a <br>genuine attempt to try to work with the private  <br>sector to get the private sector to build more <br>affordable homes instead of the traditional New  <br>Zealand business model which is to drip-feed <br>more intensive high-end homes into the market.<br>Now, we gave away those huge, <br>ambitious targets for KiwiBuild,  <br>but we have continued with the programme,  <br>and my colleague Megan Woods has continued <br>to do that, and we won't stop doing that.<br>But the reason that I've talked a lot tonight <br>about the urban development policy settings,  <br>this is absolutely critical because government  <br>will never build all the houses <br>that we need. It's not possible.<br>We must rely on the private sector <br>to build a great majority of houses,  <br>but we need the policy settings that <br>will create a market that actually works.<br>That's why we've put a lot of energy <br>into bringing new ways of financing  <br>infrastructure to the market. It's why we're <br>freeing up the planning rules through the  <br>National Policy Statement and through <br>reform of the RMA, and it's why we're  <br>bringing transport infrastructure much <br>more to the centre of urban planning.<br>All of those things will allow more and better <br>homes to be built. Put that together with the  <br>urban development legislation, we can do more <br>large-scale projects building at scale. You know,  <br>communities of five, ten, twenty-thousand <br>new homes and well-planned new communities.<br>It's a multi-pronged reform agenda that, if we <br>follow it through, will create the conditions  <br>where we don't have this terrible cycle of <br>housing shortages and obscenely expensive housing.<br>Just to pick up the issue of RMA reform which <br>you touched on, what sort of parts and things  <br>were you thinking in terms of RMA reform? <br>I know that Justice Randerson is engaged  <br>in his reform, and that's been engaged by your <br>colleague, the Minister for the Environment,  <br>but what sort of ideas as the government <br>do you have in terms of those reforms?<br>So I can only speak to the <br>urban dimension. So the RMA  <br>is obviously much bigger than the built <br>environment, but let me focus on that.<br>And so many of the things that I've spoken <br>about tonight that underpin our urban policy  <br>will be reflected in the proposals that think <br>you'll see coming out of the reform process.<br>So, for example, this approach to <br>spatial planning which is really  <br>about - it's highly collaborative, <br>so it's not just councils doing it.<br>It's got to involve iwi, it's got to involve <br>the private sector and the wider community,  <br>and it's a break with the dominant approach <br>under the RMA for the last 30 years, which was  <br>essentially based on the notion, let the market do <br>whatever it wants and mitigate the effects of it.<br>It treats development as kind of a <br>bad thing that has costs or imposes  <br>externalities and says let's mitigate <br>them and negotiate around the edges.<br>In our view, urban development is a <br>good thing. We need more of it. We've  <br>got to embrace growth and choose <br>the kind of growth that we want.<br>So this spatial planning approach to <br>urban growth is a very different approach,  <br>and I hope that you'll see that <br>coming through the RMA reforms.<br>I mean, I think that's a really good <br>point. You know, you look at those  <br>first and second-generation district plans, <br>and where did they talk about the positive  <br>benefit of urbanism and all that sort of <br>stuff? I think it's a really good point.<br>Another anonymous attendee says, “thank <br>you very much, Phil. Could you advise,  <br>have you been in any consultation with the <br>youth and the younger population on the  <br>Urban Development Bill? Because they're the <br>future occupiers and shapers of our cities.”<br>Which is a good quote.<br>Very good question, yeah.<br>So we put the Kāinga Ora legislation, and the <br>Urban Development - the Kāinga Ora legislation  <br>was establishing the agency then the Urban <br>Development Bill have gone through full select  <br>committee processes and they also went through <br>kind of a lot of stakeholder consultation in  <br>the design phase and the National Policy <br>Statement on Urban Development also has  <br>been widely consulted around the country <br>and has gone through a full consultation.<br>And actually, I would say that groups like <br>Generation Zero who are our kind of youth  <br>voice on sustainability issues and are very <br>active around the built environment, transport,  <br>housing and so on, in all of those cases, <br>Generation Zero have been pretty active.<br>But I wouldn't claim that it's been some kind  <br>of model or success story of youth <br>engagement. Right across politics,  <br>I think that's one of the big challenges <br>that we have, and we've got to do better.<br>I mean, I think that's a really <br>important point. Thank you very much.<br>Just picking up here, we’ve <br>got something from Alister A.<br>‘’You hit the nail on the head, all the many and <br>varied reasons for housing affordability issues.  <br>Biggest by far is that we treat housing and the <br>buying of land as an investment, and many more  <br>than the other reasons, this is a big problem. <br>How do you address this particular issue?”<br>I suppose that's the whole issue <br>about how we treat investment. We  <br>treat housing as our number one <br>primary investment, don't we?<br>It is. It is. So there's a couple of angles on <br>this. So one is around tax. Tax treatment is  <br>very important, and that's why we for instance <br>shut down the tax breaks that have been in the  <br>system for the last 30 years or more that <br>allowed negative gearing, that allowed  <br>property investors to write off their losses on <br>one property against other business activity.<br>And we pushed out from five years to <br>10 years the so called bright-line  <br>treatment so that if you sell a rental <br>property within ten years - no, sorry,  <br>from two years to five years. I beg your pardon. <br>If you sell that property within the five years,  <br>then you pay income tax on all <br>of the profit that you make.<br>So those are two important changes. On the <br>other side, the supply side, a lot of our  <br>agenda really has been about trying to make <br>sure that the market can respond to demand.<br>What makes property speculation such a <br>lucrative business in New Zealand for much  <br>of the time is that our market doesn't properly <br>respond to demand. Demand outstripped supply,  <br>and house prices go up, and the people who bet <br>on those changes are the property speculators.<br>They make a killing at the expense of <br>every other person's housing costs in  <br>New Zealand. It's the same with land bankers.<br>The urban containment model of town planning <br>creates a boundary with a land on the urban  <br>side of that boundary can sometimes be up <br>to ten times the value of the rural lands  <br>that cannot be developed for housing, and what <br>land bankers do is they take a bit on when the  <br>boundary will be pushed out, and they make often <br>massive returns and to cost of everybody else.<br>Now, if we can grow our cities in a <br>much more expansive way, up and out,  <br>but only with good infrastructure, <br>then the market will meet the demand,  <br>and it will chip away at the <br>business model of the speculators.<br>And that is, I believe, that <br>is the long-term answer.<br>I mean, I suppose that's the <br>interesting question about  <br>when you do that evaluation between these <br>things what's the value of the rural land  <br>without the infrastructure? And I suppose <br>that's the point you're making, isn't it?<br>I’ve got a question here. I’m gonna <br>slightly attack here, but I have a  <br>question from Caroline. Great to see someone <br>from Hamilton is actually watching us today.<br>“Compulsory acquisition. I live in Hamilton, <br>where the subdivision patterns of the city was  <br>fundamentally established in the 1960s through <br>to the 80s. Impossible for incomprehensive  <br>urban intensification. How gutsy is Kāinga <br>Ora going to be with its compulsory powers?<br>That's a good question.<br>Yeah, thank you, Caroline.<br>Actually, let me say first that I'm actually <br>really excited by the work that we've been doing,  <br>not only with Hamilton City Council, but with <br>Waikato Tainui, with Waipā District Council,  <br>Waikato District, Waikato Regional Councils.<br>We've done this pretty amazing Hamilton <br>Waikato Metro spatial plan that involves  <br>quite radical intensification <br>reforms to the zoning in Hamilton,  <br>the building of a rapid transit network <br>using the existing heavy rail network,  <br>not only servicing a lot of the key employment <br>and housing nodes in the existing Hamilton City,  <br>but going out to Te Awamutu, to <br>Morrinsville, to Cambridge up to Ngāruawāhia.<br>So you get this radial set of corridors which <br>are fantastic for Hamilton's future growth,  <br>and so that is a that's a very, very big shift <br>away from the traditional development pattern that  <br>we've seen in places like Hamilton and Tauranga - <br>low-rise suburban expansion and lots of motorways.<br>So I think that's very, very promising, <br>and the councils there have shown their  <br>willingness to embrace these reforms. I don't <br>see us using compulsory acquisition to go,  <br>and you know, forcibly acquire a whole <br>lot of urban land and then redevelop it,  <br>but I think there are some interesting examples <br>around the world of cities that have facilitated,  <br>through zoning reform and transport investments, <br>have facilitated the second generation growth that  <br>encourages incumbent landowners to redevelop <br>their properties and shift, for example,  <br>to you know duplexes or three-story <br>apartments and away from that low-rise,  <br>so I think you'll see lots of that in <br>New Zealand cities including Hamilton.<br>You'll also see much more ambitious urban <br>intensification in the city centres and  <br>then also in town centres around <br>rapid transit and railway stations.<br>I’ve got a question here from Morton, which <br>I think is a really interesting one. And I’m  <br>just paraphrasing what he’s saying. He’s talking <br>about have you and your colleagues thought about  <br>establishing the cooperative housing model? <br>And he gives a few of those Nordic examples.<br>Yeah, thanks for that, Morton. I have to <br>be brutally honest with you and say that  <br>in the last two and a half years or three <br>years in government, we haven't done this,  <br>but it's clear to me that there is lots <br>of potential here if we want to grow a  <br>more kind of diverse and innovative <br>housing ecosystem that co-housing or  <br>cooperative housing could have a really <br>interesting and positive role to play.<br>I was in Dunedin recently where there's <br>a co-housing association who took over  <br>an old primary school right in the town in <br>Dunedin, and they've reworked it and they  <br>are building I think they've got more <br>than 20 two-story townhouses built to  <br>passive house standards in a fantastic <br>development there right in the heart of  <br>Dunedin using a co-housing model and there <br>are a number of others around the country.<br>Earthsong, which is one of the <br>well-established co-housing  <br>operations, is in my electorate in West Auckland,  <br>and so I think there's a lot that we can learn <br>from what is really an international movement.<br>It's got a great heritage in Scandinavia but a  <br>number of other countries around <br>the world are dealing with this.<br>We could do well to allow some <br>of these models to flourish here.<br>Because I mean that sort of leads <br>on to the whole land tenure model,  <br>doesn't it? In the way that we finance <br>development or finance housing.<br>Because being involved in the one in Grey <br>Lynn as the commissioner, I found it a very,  <br>very interesting model that they're running <br>there and the problems that they ran into and  <br>just in the Unit Titles Act. And is that something <br>that the government would be looking at changing  <br>those tenure models to make these sort of things <br>more easy to attain? Do you know what I’m saying?<br>Yeah, I hope in the next term of government,  <br>if we're lucky enough to be re-elected <br>we will look at modernising the Unit  <br>Titles Act just for more apartment living. It’s <br>essential that we modernise that legislation.<br>But I think we could also look at some of <br>those other models, Lee, to try and make it  <br>easier for people to do - you know, models <br>like, you know, in North America where they  <br>talk about cooperative housing or co-ops, it has a <br>different connotation to Scandinavian co-housing.<br>In the States, it often just means a <br>bunch of what we would call apartments  <br>or flats on a shared piece of land, <br>sometimes with some common facilities.<br>Now if we can find ways to allow people in our <br>cities to build the kind of homes they want in the  <br>places where they want to live where the land cost <br>is less because there's more density or you've  <br>got a number of units and one sharing a single <br>title then we're gonna be giving people better  <br>housing choices and ultimately if there's enough <br>of it happening it will bring down the price of  <br>housing because you'll have more housing and more <br>development opportunities available for people.<br>Thank you. One question from Astafa: “how <br>does the new build help the SDG 2030 goals?”<br>Yeah, so the notion of sustainability and both <br>social and economic and environmental is at the  <br>heart of this agenda, and the values that we <br>talk about for our government and our economic  <br>plan for New Zealand is about building a more <br>sustainable, inclusive and productive New Zealand,  <br>and so at the heart of our vision is, <br>in terms of social sustainability,  <br>is really ensuring that New Zealanders can <br>be decently housed and have access to good  <br>quality housing that they can afford <br>in places where they want to live.<br>Kāinga Ora and exercising the powers under the <br>Urban Development Act has to give appropriate  <br>consideration to the overriding imperative that <br>our government has to reduce carbon emissions.<br>And so, you know, building whole new <br>communities that have access to rapid  <br>transit and public transport is really <br>important, and the vision that I see is  <br>that in many of these new communities, <br>you won't have like in the old days,  <br>some sort of mandatory requirement that you <br>have one or two car parks in your apartment.<br>If you want to have a car park, you'll <br>be able to buy or lease it separately,  <br>or better still, you'll have access to <br>ride-sharing services in your community  <br>and great walking and cycling infrastructure and <br>walkable access to frequent public transport.<br>And those things will help us <br>to realise the potential that  <br>cities have for a much smaller carbon footprint.<br>Because I mean, just picking up that point, <br>there was some work done by some colleagues  <br>at Massey University that told that if we <br>kept housing size existing construction  <br>techniques - I mean, you've probably <br>seen this - and then life cycle things,  <br>that if we didn't change that we would <br>exceed our Paris obligations by five times.<br>And so what's happening in <br>that construction sector  <br>to deal with those sort of sustainability issues?<br>Yeah, so alongside the work that I’m doing in <br>transport to reduce our carbon emissions by,  <br>you know, electrifying the vehicle fleet and <br>so on and so forth, in the built environment  <br>we know that it's responsible for about I <br>think 17 per cent of our carbon emissions.<br>So we've got the potential here to really make <br>some gains. My colleague Jenny Salesa who's  <br>the Minister of Building and Construction, she <br>recently launched a programme of work which is  <br>about reducing carbon emissions in construction <br>processes and reforms to the Building Act  <br>and the Building Code that will set higher <br>standards for thermal efficiency and reduce,  <br>not only in terms of the production <br>processes and building materials,  <br>but also the embodied carbon <br>content of our buildings.<br>So that's really important work, and <br>as Economic Development Minister,  <br>I'm also responsible for government procurement.<br>Now, the government spends, you know, 42 billion <br>dollars a year buying goods and services,  <br>and we build a lot of things, build a lot <br>of buildings, so I'm very interested in  <br>how we can require and incentivise government <br>agencies to build the lowest carbon option and  <br>use materials and processes to ensure that we’re <br>reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings.<br>So there's a couple of things, but <br>we've got a long way to go on this.<br>I think we've got time for just one last <br>question, and I think I'll take this one  <br>from Julie Stout. She’ll kill me if I don't <br>take it. The question’s to do with “do you  <br>believe that the latest reports out today <br>on the port relocation takes into account  <br>the transformational changes possible <br>as you've outlined in shifting the port,  <br>just not for Auckland but also unlocking the <br>economic employment and growth for Northland?”<br>Yeah, so Julie, as Transport Minister, I am <br>particularly focused as you might have heard  <br>in my public comments today and as we think <br>about the future of the Ports of Auckland,  <br>we have to recognise that the Ports <br>of Auckland cannot continue in its  <br>current location for longer than about 30 years.<br>That's the most generous estimate, probably <br>less than that. We have a window of about 10  <br>to 15 years to make a decision and prepare for a <br>new configuration of the ports of the upper North  <br>Island that bring in most of our country's imports <br>and send most of our exports out to the world.<br>And I'm very focused on ensuring that we make <br>what is quite a complex decision that will cost  <br>us as a country billions of dollars in this <br>sort of investment in the infrastructure,  <br>that we make that on the basis of what <br>will give us a really efficient supply  <br>chain for our economy, exports and imports <br>but also what is environmentally sustainable,  <br>and I'm determined that we will work <br>through this decision on those two  <br>factors on the basis of a really <br>rigorous and sound evidence base.<br>I think it will be also, it's a very happy <br>co-benefit for Auckland that as the port is  <br>moved out of that central city location, there <br>will be an amazing opportunity to redevelop,  <br>regenerate what is part of the heart of <br>Auckland in an amazing waterfront setting.<br>And you never know, maybe the <br>Urban Development Act and its  <br>provisions for large scale complex urban <br>regeneration will assist in that task.<br>Thank you. We’ve come around to time, and we <br>can't take any more of your time, Minister.<br>And Phil, I’d just like to thank you very much for <br>making the time and your support for the School  <br>and the University. Thank you very much for a <br>very candid and very insightful conversation,  <br>and it's always good to talk to you and thanks <br>very much for your time and thanks very much.<br>Thank you.<br>And I’d just like to say thank you to everyone, <br>all the participants in the Fast Forward series. <br>Unfortunately, that's the Winter Series coming to <br>an end. We managed to get some stuff back online  <br>with Sam, and I'd just like to thank Neeve, <br>Lynette and Brent for all their hard work  <br>in making that happen. We'll be back in spring <br>with someone else running the programme for you,  <br>but the questions will be whether we're <br>online or in face. We're still making  <br>that decision. We might be on Zoom because I <br>think that's quite helpful. A lot of people  <br>can engage in that way, so on that note, <br>thanks very much for everyone who's engaged.<br>Thanks for your questions. Sorry we couldn’t get <br>to them all tonight. It's great to have you here,  <br>and thanks very much for your time <br>and have a good night. Thank you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
