accurate.</p><p>good everybody and welcome to the first<br>ever completely online retraced<br>orientation for position of Health<br>engineering computing in science my name<br>is Joseph Henderson and today I'm going<br>to run through a bunch of infer this<br>will hopefully make a transition to sure<br>education just a little bit easier<br>before we begin so while I can't hear<br>we'll see you you should have access to<br>check function on your in so if you did<br>have any questions please feel free to<br>put them in you should have an option<br>for it to be public or private and so<br>the question you're asking you think is<br>going to be broadly applicable to<br>everyone but if you want there's some<br>more specifics just you and put them<br>privately and we can answer it respect<br>you will answer the majority of the<br>questions have beened<br>but you don't need to wait until the end<br>to ask them so just when we nuclear in<br>Reidy so if let's see let's keep things<br>moving so exciting users start just by<br>being here today you go you're in the<br>drawer for one of these very stylish<br>University of Waikato police so you<br>don't have to do anything you just<br>really in the drawer so fingers crossed<br>so what we want to talk about first is<br>sort of a distinction between the<br>divisions which end in the intro and in<br>the scores so that both will be relevant<br>to you but what we want to do here is<br>make the distinction<br>how are relevant and what you would<br>access each for and since that would be<br>division is the overarching structure<br>which contains these two hunky wellness<br>or become a School of Engineering the<br>School of Computing and metal Sciences<br>and the School of Science and so we<br>refer to it as it was short<br>ma BSO he is referring to the division<br>of in sport so study with the division<br>and which is the air by distance in<br>cities name is along with henna and<br>Courtney and who to give we have the<br>division region<br>so you'll likely become very familiar<br>with us over the course of your studies<br>and what we're here to do Premier Li is<br>to help you with enrollment side of your<br>student journey and with a seed we sort<br>of affairs want the contact point for<br>any question you might have disease<br>primarily with being a replanting<br>janking you enrollment changing of<br>decrees and issues that arise during the<br>same yeah so that's the registrar's so<br>in general the easiest way to get in<br>touch class is by email and so there we<br>go the emails just being put in the<br>chance say if it's a short question<br>emails it is you can also call us if you<br>were wanting more time<br>you're the wireless but more involved<br>and you can book appointments to see us<br>which can be done through this online<br>forum here or via the effective<br>solutions absolutely show you later on<br>but the forum is the easiest way to do<br>it and yes points 20 minutes can be by<br>phone or zoom they can also be a person<br>and but obviously was the strongest<br>being a little unique in terms of the<br>Bing or online your phone zoom better if<br>you're with your on campus by all means<br>you can indicate that you want to come<br>in and see us dead if key so also from<br>the division they'll Student Success<br>coordinators and so they able to help<br>you things like noodle study skills<br>special consideration through missed<br>assignments in extra study camp so yes a<br>list so issues with being wronged itself<br>more once you're within your papers the<br>semester started and you think you might<br>need a bit of extra tutorial helpful or<br>something like then we were in journey<br>to people to in touch with yeah so Libra<br>is based in Hampton in Joanie is based<br>and so while yes at this point we sort<br>of want a Satori state throughout your<br>student journey with us and that's<br>likely that you'll come across some<br>challenges likely that you'll come<br>across some challenges<br>M it's completely normal and we in 99<br>we're not in cases can assist you it's<br>just we need you to tell us that if you<br>need our help and so in things that you<br>might need help with that's incredibly<br>variable and who the person are now<br>members that will eventually help you up<br>there there's also pretty variable but<br>we can't assist if we don't know it's a<br>problem and say you so just here is a<br>sort of a list of different outlets to<br>ask so firstly we've got Student Success<br>coordinators and it was in Jody here we<br>just previously and case managers which<br>we'll get into a little bit later on<br>senior tutors and lecturers so that's<br>they would primarily be fair issues that<br>arise with in your papers and depending<br>on the the scope of the issue would<br>dictate which one of those you spoke<br>with and boniva would be able to help<br>than the chef at the divisional school<br>staff and so the vision staff in this<br>case would be the registrar's who we<br>just do the end of myself included and<br>the school staff that we will get to in<br>a little bit and in these the broader<br>University services essential services<br>they set outside the school and so<br>common things that might need Hansa<br>special considerations they would be if<br>assignment missed it for some reason the<br>onion control in the process for they're<br>withdrawing sometimes that's what needs<br>to happen things get a little out of<br>hand and weaknesses were there as well<br>but there are also a lot of smaller and<br>interventions we can make<br>getting to that point but again it goes<br>back to us they need to know so early we<br>know his problem that really we<br>hopefully get it sorted and so he is the<br>map just just with the division office<br>in Hamilton is based so this is where<br>the registrar's in Student Success<br>coordinators bring basis I mean which is<br>a nifty link if you have a bunch of the<br>score screens inside you won't actually<br>go over see that image but is a zoom in<br>of the if key link building it's a looks<br>like a cheese grater so it's quite easy<br>to find to get this Xion it's we mase<br>and if you need to discuss programs that<br>leave anything else at all making of one<br>would see us either in person or by<br>before we turn on staff based in the hub<br>which is just on the first born of peace<br>campus building see it's a dental you'd<br>be able to see Jody or any of the other<br>terminal support staff and so now we<br>won't just touch on some key dates so<br>bleachers you'll be generous the papers<br>will start on Monday so hopefully ready<br>to go tutorials and labs vary between<br>schools and so I'll just we'll go on<br>today and we'll develop it later on but<br>if you in science or engineering your<br>labs and tutorials will begin next week<br>as well also just keep keep in mind and<br>if you're in the school to attack us for<br>the cause it's called a competing method<br>of Sciences we'll begin with a little<br>more detail shortly the next day there's<br>quite an important one as at the end of<br>the second week is when you can change<br>your papers without any sort of pointy<br>so well let's think you'd be all<br>enrolled in the papers if you want to do<br>at the start sometimes<br>obviously the bleachers or somewhere<br>there and find actually Pacifica mode<br>effect I don't want to do so provided<br>you come to that realization before we<br>in the second week we can't change it if<br>you come to that realization about a<br>compulsory paper that becomes a more<br>complicated conversation but it's still<br>one we should have really honor the base<br>and yeah so the end of the second week<br>although obviously but later you change<br>your paper the more you will have missed<br>of the paper you wanting to change into<br>so yes if you did the first nature in<br>for hikes I really don't want do this<br>paper change don't wait until the end of<br>the season week and then have to play<br>catch-up on the paper that you've<br>changed yes so that's the end of the<br>second weeks of twins except July is a<br>teaching recess in the middle of the<br>trimester and the only sort of important<br>note around there is that as a teaching<br>research lab a study rhesus so you will<br>likely select to do over that period<br>it just won't be tutorials or features<br>all that period I mean yeah at the end<br>of the trimester there will be a study<br>with this which will be before the<br>two-week period Lulu we there will be<br>final tests and there won't be any for<br>exams<br>pastrami stir but they will for a lot of<br>things being a final tests which will<br>and throughout the year particularly<br>sort of towards the end of each semester<br>is when we would start looking at your<br>papers for next year if you're not<br>concluding your study the Stroh mister<br>and yeah so you keep an eye on your<br>columns move in touch about then and<br>you've got a book at a time to see<br>myself corneal henna to discuss it what<br>what your program is starting to look<br>like the next year so lewd to it early<br>as a case management so might sound sort<br>of like scary oversight sort of fun<br>but it's really not its intention and it<br>seems to me wall this is a person who<br>will be assigned to you who is either<br>the liaison or a source of advice the<br>situation to me you might not know what<br>to do so they in touch with you and sort<br>of the first few weeks of the trimester<br>you don't need to do anything and just<br>all they likely be an email and business<br>that's just introducing themselves and<br>what yeah how you could get in touch<br>with them and you can engage with them<br>as much or as little as you want to say<br>you don't have to you can simply respond<br>to the fist acquire you don't have I'm<br>good but I'll let you know if I need out<br>that's if you might want more constant<br>support there now there'll be how to<br>facilitate them if not provided<br>themselves as if you hear case<br>management that's referring to and a key<br>and if it if your meetings they reach<br>out the help it's often a good fist<br>point yes I just keep it in mind earlier<br>we've gone through the division now<br>we'll just sort of briefly touch on what<br>the individual schools to so their<br>respective school administrations help<br>of things like paper information<br>application form so extensions special<br>consideration graduate planners access<br>to labs or after-hours access or if you<br>need to meet with the academic staff<br>which is etcetera and that aren't<br>directly involved in your papers and<br>these are the only ever quick learn<br>about the school's the school's oversee<br>individual papers so while you might be<br>a for instance you might be doing a BC<br>in chemistry but if you were doing<br>stents triple one as a paper that would<br>sit under the school of competing<br>mathematical sciences because it's a<br>rather thin school of science and but<br>then information will be in your<br>individual paper at once just something<br>to keep in mind<br>so we School of Computing in metal<br>Sciences so the two administrators the<br>Rachel<br>and Maria and they are both based on the<br>ground floor of chi block the School of<br>Engineering so the administrators<br>Natalie in Miri and they are on the<br>ground the second floor sorry of a block<br>the school of science it's Gloria Fiona<br>and Vicky and they are also on the<br>second floor of a block directly across<br>the corridor from school engineering so<br>that both quite easy to find - who<br>attack you over the School of Health<br>they are I suppose the separate entity<br>here and there they are on the other<br>side of campus and TTE on the sixth<br>floor and Dean as the administrator out<br>there that you'd be looking for and how<br>long about students and any school<br>functions that we're referring to here<br>in total what would happen within the<br>individual papers so you don't you<br>wouldn't need to access the school<br>offices the next scenes just talk to you<br>all<br>Italy teachers tutors within the papers<br>and now advise you on any of those<br>functions that you need to need to be<br>following so no touched on it earlier<br>again but lab applications so lab in<br>tutorials often used interchangeably but<br>it is the slice particularly referring<br>to the science papers so labs start in<br>week one so don't start next week and<br>you can sign up for them in Moodle from<br>now so you haven't already engaged with<br>their process you should do it as soon<br>as possible just because yeah they are<br>streams if you couldn't come on campus<br>for instance there'll be a specific<br>stream that the online occurrence and<br>usually you need to sort of engage with<br>there so as you don't miss out and this<br>signup process is the same for<br>engineering and those will also begin in<br>week one and the competing mathematical<br>sciences and health papers will the<br>editorials will begin on whether to so<br>and is<br>I suppose a little miss agency in terms<br>of signing up tutorials are those but<br>there will also be done through Moodle<br>and things available lab coats sir if<br>you are a science students engineer or<br>engineer you need a letter more than<br>like them and so this link here is where<br>you sign up for their and process<br>basically you order it all online you<br>don't order a specific size just for the<br>order for online you will be seen to<br>receipt and then you collected from the<br>science store which is in if doctor<br>chain once and servants if block<br>ground-floor room 16 but you can just X<br>quickest way there so just go to your<br>section which we referred to earlier and<br>in here you've seen the receipt for<br>collection<br>same with but you can also you don't<br>have to have a university of waikato one<br>specifically so a proper lab don't for<br>me we will do so they can also be<br>purchased by a trade me war ends its<br>safety yeah so that's the lead coats so<br>now we want to get a bit more into<br>subjects and degree structures so since<br>you're already here you will be doing a<br>degree and majoring in one of these<br>subjects so there's quite a few listed<br>and we don't necessarily go to run<br>through all of them what we wanted to<br>get across here is that depending on<br>your degree service I suppose does<br>exclude our engineering in better health<br>friends as well as the first grade<br>students but if you're not doing one of<br>those qualifications you have a bit of<br>flexibility looking at the crater to do<br>all in one subject and so what we just<br>want you to sort of get across here is<br>that there are a range of related useful<br>subjects that you could use to<br>compliment your degree so getting data<br>analytics or statistics<br>the science majors can only help<br>something and their offensive is also<br>subjected outside of our division that<br>might be useful preferably yeah but all<br>we really wanted to get across this<br>pointless to think about your degree in<br>totality and what you can do to sort of<br>make it more valuable at the end that's<br>it electives<br>it's actually there's movement of the<br>degree structures real quickly so this<br>one here is an example of a fully<br>prescribed degree so in our case this<br>would be referring to the engineering<br>qualifications it'll be better of<br>engineering with honors and the two<br>strings of the Bachelor of Health and<br>also post great balls don't get the same<br>subject availability and you can sort of<br>see here that all of the boxes have a<br>specific reference so you don't really<br>get to pick which papers you're going to<br>do beyond some program electives which<br>are papers from a specific list and if<br>we switch to what's a regular nature of<br>science receive it and the yellow being<br>we've got the major so in this case it's<br>decides and so the yellow papers here<br>are the major black box as the<br>compulsory papers in the red boxes are<br>believers and the electives can't be<br>anything so it might be that you want to<br>touch on a whole bunch of nation turists<br>always head and do a paper here of the<br>earring on each of those or it might be<br>that you just want to do more computer<br>science either of those approaches are<br>completely valid but you could also<br>potentially do a second major or two<br>minors and it's a range of subjects that<br>will complement your primary ones so you<br>ought again always thinking about your<br>degree in total and what you could<br>potentially do to add more value to it<br>and yeah if you did have some ideas and<br>wanted to talk about that that would be<br>sort of a perfect example of what you<br>were taught to myself or one of the<br>other register as about so yeah if you<br>wanting to follow up on it at all<br>and there will be one situation we could<br>book by that appointment booking link or<br>get in touch with us if GE class<br>representatives so each class you're in<br>will have a classroom so badly to help<br>mediate relevant issues pass on issues<br>there to the academic staff or pass on<br>some bankers that intermediary between<br>the student body of the class and the<br>lecturers or the making fingers it can<br>be sort of you positively and something<br>you can last time you see me etc and 100<br>level each club is one classroom further<br>the LED string that's a little different<br>to the other papers and the nominator<br>volunteering for that will happen within<br>the papers and so you're just sort of<br>engaged during the first week if there's<br>something you're interested in and the<br>lecturer will be you know how that<br>process is going to play out in its<br>specific paper so well-being so we<br>thought the earlier about situations<br>where you might need to reach out some<br>help and while within the division and<br>the schools we have more than happy to<br>help in any way we can sometimes you<br>might need some specialist assistance so<br>the two resources listed here are<br>examples of with approved go to so the<br>Student Health Center is obviously<br>anything medical and the Student<br>Counseling Service which is sort of base<br>versus you can have Center yeah but more<br>politic traditional sort of council and<br>sort of mental health side events so you<br>both good resources to keep in the back<br>in mind if in case you need them down<br>the road and but again if you weren't<br>sure who to contact about the sort of<br>thing this is a situation where you<br>could the guys with your case manager or<br>the division and we can help facilitate<br>interaction as well so akin it's just<br>I'm asking for help you eat it student<br>clubs so there are a range of student<br>clubs within these schools within the<br>division who can provide some variable<br>support often is a more social aspect to<br>the student ones but there are so more<br>sort of proper function survey survey<br>Levine's volunteering opportunities<br>genial support and often networking<br>/ industry connections and it means so<br>information down information about those<br>individual clubs will sort of present<br>itself to you over the next couple of<br>weeks so if you want to get involved<br>just follow the prompts that they give<br>you so here is the Hamilton campus so we<br>looked at zoomed in image of it earlier<br>and but this is the bigger version so if<br>G is where the division is based and<br>again you can see it a bit more clearly<br>this time the big cheese grater that is<br>we even find us and it's quite small but<br>if you look sort of straight line up<br>from where we're based and is a speed<br>problem versus education health support<br>engine performance and the TT building<br>the event is where the School of Health<br>is based on this it's there just for any<br>health students with us at the moment<br>and we turn on the campus so obviously<br>it's one of multiple floors so for<br>reference here that hub which we<br>mentioned earlier is on level one and in<br>the higher floors will be where the<br>teaching in names based and we actually<br>slip through that relatively quickly so<br>let's have a look at some questions so<br>the first question about here is we<br>could I find from their sign up for your<br>tutorial page so that will be within the<br>individual Moodle pages<br>so each individual paper will have its<br>own portal within Moodle and within<br>their paper there will be information on<br>how to sign up for the labs or tutorials<br>so you'll want to go to Moodle and<br>infirmed individual papers depending on<br>the subject the tutorial sign up might<br>not be available yet sometimes they have<br>been a during the first week for those<br>that are starting at week two but the<br>science in engineering ones should all<br>be available from now so you have ever<br>listened to that and if you're having<br>any issue at all of that get in touch<br>with us via email there's probably the<br>easiest way yeah so the next question is<br>if I cannot see any be papers on Moodle<br>what should I do so there's a few<br>different potential causes of this the<br>first is that you haven't fully<br>completed your enrollment that's the<br>most likely welcome so you should be<br>able to view all that via the my Aikido<br>section of the online system rather than<br>Moodle and see if you if you go on there<br>and it looks like and it says that<br>you're all enrolled the papers should be<br>a Moodle so in that case the likely<br>issue is that the Moodle portal for the<br>individual paper just hasn't been opened<br>yet so the Moodle portals description of<br>the big trip so sometimes they're not<br>yeah open until the first week again in<br>the case of the sites and engineering<br>papers that shouldn't be the case<br>because the tutorial starts already hit<br>me and say here so the rootball seems to<br>be but you're not enrolled and keep in<br>touch with us as soon as possible and we<br>can help resolve it if you are enrolled<br>in the pegs and Moodle and give it a<br>couple of days but if it's not the end<br>sort of by if it's not me by tomorrow<br>and<br>get in touch as well and we can follow<br>their one up for you so we have another<br>question what if I can't a team alais<br>so I suppose it's got a Western<br>interpret that's when evidence you can a<br>team an individual like wheat of a lab<br>there would be a situation where you<br>would just communicate with your tutor<br>or lecturer often you can be alternate<br>arrangements made on sort of the short<br>term absences if it's that you can't<br>attend delayed at all I even sort of<br>study off-campus<br>and then will depend a little bit on the<br>specifics of it paper but you should get<br>in touch with the nature of the paper in<br>the first instance in you should<br>probably try to do that as soon as<br>possible here just so we can have a bit<br>of time to come to the resolution before<br>next week starts so the next question is<br>Moodle we've organized your timetables<br>and today is a timetable builder on the<br>website which isn't necessarily with a<br>Moodle but the difficulty we have at the<br>moment is so the system dinner at a time<br>they will always worked on and the basis<br>of lecture times which in most years is<br>very useful and but this year with the<br>lecture contents all being covered<br>online and not necessarily live II's a<br>bit specific times the leisure times and<br>the times they will necessarily hugely<br>reliable so what we would probably<br>suggest in this case is checking how<br>each individual papers going to operate<br>via via Moodle portal and in sort of<br>building I suppose a bespoke sort of<br>timetable from near because year the the<br>automatic information times ever won't<br>so there is the question that I have<br>listed here which given a couple of<br>seconds if anyone else wanted to check<br>something<br>broad it in and so if you have put a<br>private question and then we haven't<br>answered yet we will get an answer to<br>so if there aren't any other questions a<br>couple beer so one just come through our<br>old itches online what does the paper<br>and so the lecture content services we<br>make a distinction between lectures and<br>tutorials so the beach' content should<br>all be online tutorials there are some<br>papers where the tutorials are available<br>online if this is the case and that will<br>be communicated to you sort of<br>individually so just keep an eye out for<br>that and but be all of the other papers<br>these should be options for on-campus<br>tutorials and online versions which does<br>make the signup sort of period<br>particularly important this time because<br>if you absolutely need to be in the<br>online one you should engage with their<br>presence since early as possible so that<br>we get full if it didn't fall for any<br>reason we'd probably be able to work<br>around it but yeah you'd be better off<br>sitting is another question off screen<br>so this one from just asking about<br>electives and what you can choose so an<br>elite tha's there so the useful answer I<br>suppose is that it can be anything at<br>all complicated version of that answer<br>is that it can be anything at all so if<br>you yeah<br>provided you meet the prereqs for the<br>individual papers you can you can do<br>anything as the electives but this<br>against us where you could be looking at<br>grouping the the electives into a<br>coherent sort of minor or sick and major<br>if if your interests were all sort of<br>so this one is car parking available so<br>Kappa is available on the Hilton campus<br>it does cost off the top of my head I<br>can't remember exactly how much it costs<br>but there is plenty of parking available<br>on campus and you can either pay for a<br>full trimester or individual day or<br>individual week and I think that there<br>is one year I'm waiting for my credit<br>transfer resorption I select paper now<br>or wait for result being released at<br>this point it would make sense to select<br>the papers so while I'm sure if it's<br>been made to get credit transfer process<br>yeah getting this paper selection part<br>of their process and the way you will<br>definitely be beneficial just so we're<br>not sort of artificially delaying start<br>at your trimester just the the papers<br>provided the credits probably books okay<br>and the pages can be approved prior to<br>the formerly being approved and so yeah<br>I would suggest getting papers in as<br>soon as possible so there's a number one<br>Mulas still saying this paper is not<br>currently visible to students if the<br>semester please contact your lecturer<br>for engineering purposes that thing that<br>all the types are open you it would tend<br>to indicate the yes so I would suggest<br>if it's just the specific paper I would<br>email that through to contact its which<br>was the email from one of the earlier<br>slides so contact - DX HACC is waked oh<br>not a co-ed and we'll be able to chase<br>that up for you and I think they might<br>be there we go<br>FS student so the next question is if a<br>student were to do all four major papers<br>like convicts 101 convicts 22 season<br>expensively ms 25 would it be too much<br>work for a new student for a semester<br>and<br>this one's specifically referring to a<br>computer science student<br>so the workload wouldn't we wouldn't<br>think that workload was going to be too<br>heavy but the issue you would run into<br>with their famous election is that<br>complex 101 is the prerequisite for<br>complex 102 meaning that you have to<br>complete complex 101 before proceeding<br>into comics 102 so yeah in that<br>particular version of map selection we<br>would be looking to replace competes 102<br>with something else either a field of<br>the degree vapor or an elective yeah<br>and but that's what actually things make<br>the jumping-off point just to briefly<br>discuss how workload works so so you'll<br>hear things like full-time study<br>part-time study the full-time or<br>part-time or just the workload is based<br>on flints which obviously correlate the<br>papers but the number of points in a<br>paper indicates the total amount of work<br>required so it's not like for computer<br>science papers is a heavier workload<br>being for psychology papers for instance<br>60 points roughly equates to 60 points<br>the only variability would appear would<br>be and sort of an individual basis you<br>might find one subject more difficult<br>than another kind of think about 60<br>points is a bit at least an equivalent<br>workloads are 60 points yes events that<br>question me so one is my enrollment<br>status enrolled but I cannot see any<br>papers where do I have to contact so<br>again I were to use contacting contact<br>cakes or contacts - Keeks<br>like you do though a seed of in seed and<br>will be able to follow that up depending<br>on how recently you completed your<br>enrollment there might be a bit of a<br>system delay and the papers building<br>available but if you've been enrolled<br>for sort of more than half a day and a<br>little the moves are available you<br>should have access to them by now so it<br>might just be that the papers for their<br>particular enrollment there sorry<br>haven't been<br>that's quite common particularly for the<br>higher level papers so the query papers<br>we're tutorial and lamp sign up is less<br>intensive I suppose but again if you had<br>any questions or you thought that the<br>light was still on<br>keep in touch with us by contactees so I<br>think that is all the questions so it<br>has been lovely talking to you all this<br>morning and again get in touch with us<br>if you have any questions at all yeah we<br>will hopefully report to helping you up<br>through the coming months and years</p></main><footer
