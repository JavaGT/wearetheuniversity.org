equally I when little<br>libraries so first of all we'd like to<br>welcome you to the Faculty of Law on the<br>screen here you can see our deeper<br>fit-out Hannah Murray there's a deal of<br>effective she also sent all of that<br> we are founded on three<br>principles here at numerix entity law<br>those three principles being<br>professionalism biculturalism and<br>brought in content and context there is<br>a direct entry into this law school<br>which is different to the other five<br>more schools so from the day that you<br>enroll you are part of our law school we<br>want you to succeed we want<br>collaboration and so we're not in<br>competition with each other or you're<br>not in competition with your colleagues<br>we also take a look at mana<br>jurisprudence throughout the degree as<br>well as more Mali jurisprudence most of<br>the courses here at any man will have<br>some male element to them through all<br>the papers and this makes us unique<br>amongst the other five schools there are<br>another entry means that we take in our<br>most goal we have guest lectures from<br>national and international jurists<br>judges senior colleagues in the<br>profession and internationally we have<br>student exchanges with other<br>universities in Europe Asia North<br>America there are internships web<br>placements we have human associations<br>which will touch on later on in the<br>webinar<br>there are mentoring programs a number of<br>them turn offer support to law students<br>throughout eternity<br>you've got opportunities to us ages that<br>classical definitive in each paper that<br>you take<br>and there are opportunities for students<br>to sit on the various University and<br>faculty boards and committees so these<br>opportunities are here for you to<br>develop your soft skills while you're at<br>law school and in turn give you some<br>extra experience where you a little<br>cooking is easy as well absolutely<br>so we're located in in block otherwise<br>known as the wall building it is on<br>Hillcrest Road<br>yes Thanksgiving you can pop in there<br>and see how Edmonton and collections<br>will be best year as we have a number of<br>students that you can use it anytime<br>during Roman law school and these<br>lounges and tables and chairs they have<br>some of them have fish nets and the<br>fridges have got hot water if you were<br>leaking lunch so captures this basically<br>relax and study and these lists are<br>specifically designed for our students<br>to come in take some time off we also<br>ever stayed in the food court which was<br>on the Hamilton campus it is only<br>faculty long so feel free to come in and<br>ask our own decision is that the front<br>desk if you can have a look if you are<br>taking legal 104 this training State you<br>will be doing a moot and it will be in<br>our motor court so for those who aren't<br>familiar and record is a mock court and<br>all of the furniture you can see and<br>then the photo will chair and the mid<br>court comes from the courts and<br>monochrome and they did so we have an<br>actual food court it does get used for<br>other things as well but it will get<br>into position sometimes isn't it yes not<br>only do we run in our more moot and<br>efficacy papers out of the record but<br>so happily screen here is our faculty<br>administration's team they're going to<br>be the team members for us students<br>throughout your time we've got Joe Smith<br>who is a little receptionist you'll see<br>how the front desk when you walk in to<br>in block surrounded growl who is the<br>senior student advisor for law he is<br>also in the North Hamilton<br>you've got myself there Lamoni liaison<br>coordinator and then you have Renee<br>Lawson and how to mesh in the program<br>and many others you'll get to know these<br>faces a bit better when you come in on<br>denver's we call into little faculty but<br>this is your admin team and you can feel<br>free to ask us anything you need and I<br>suspect that that will be for a couple<br>of weeks the elation can ask a lot of<br>questions and that's just fine with us<br>so that's your faculty and maintain next<br>up we have Moodle so if you're not<br>really familiar with Moodle this is it<br>was depository with one of your favorite<br>information is checked so once you're<br>involved in paper you log into Moodle<br>and you can see one of the information<br>about wallpaper including a paper<br>outline in our career systems the<br>tutorial set up that sort of thing<br>it's up receiving for the PowerPoint<br>close-up and seven year as well and so<br>the other really do you do need to give<br>it an eye on little thing really respect<br>yeah so your lecturers will most likely<br>communicate with is turned on and they<br>should go through to the student email<br>as well and so it's good in my own the<br>Moodle to cheat there if you have any<br>questions<br>you'll pay that ones do hear all of the<br>information about for pictures the<br>classes cost ones what you can expect<br>from the content of their paper all<br>those sort of things so but it turned<br>out like I see enter for edit comments<br>um and sliminess teachers for each year<br>one to year two and paper you will have<br>a tutorial or workshop these have to be<br>you've got to register them you've got<br>sign up for those via Moodle and these<br>tutorials are not every week for most<br>papers one of them every other week and<br>then we don't lines in peep out lines so<br>those open up next week and you can<br>choose the time of day that suits you<br>and once you're blocked in your tutorial<br>that's the tutorial that you'll be<br>attending for the rest of the rest of<br>the year if you need to change you must<br>email Lord or recipient wankers or JC NZ<br>just the minute we know that you're<br>taking out of one innards when are they<br>just keep in mind that we need to know<br>why should we check into it as well so<br>there are nice numbers that we can have<br>a tutorial is a smaller class so you'll<br>typically have maybe a hundred and fifty<br>students and your leisure or finished<br>ends looking in and then your brain<br>often to watch tutorials made up of<br>around 35 students and so some of those<br>tutorials and workshops are going to be<br>it makes and so it is a good idea to<br>make sure you sign up as early as you<br>signing up is as easy as going onto<br>Moodle and there will be a drop down<br>menu we you have the option to choose<br>the tutorial time and that if in doubt<br>come in and see us a little faculty or<br>quality and have a chat with Joe or<br>anyone of us we can appear so your<br>course materials are a set of<br>information and their readings in cases<br>or other readings that are necessary for<br>your learning throughout the paper for<br>you one all of those materials are in<br>the other thing warm I normally get<br>these books online visitors dog like<br>online as well yes your course materials<br>are outlined in<br>outlined in again you'll have a blown<br>crumbs through all of the necessary<br>information field paper your consumer<br>information the reading that you need to<br>do and liners when you're touching on<br>each subject you can find that on Moodle<br>as well but if you pop into your paper<br>outline scroll down to your required and<br>recommended readings will outline the<br>readings that you have for that paper or<br>what you need to have access to and my<br>team said we hear one or god bless<br>giving the resident mine and thank you<br>have a job all right members getting<br>that fast because we have been a billion<br>times over there<br>and so one book that I think is you're<br>going to need for the rest of your time<br>middle school is the law style guide so<br>you're going to notice it's a necessary<br>reading for creating a shingle papers is<br>a recently graduated most you know I<br>found it I use that very well during my<br>time in law school and it is something<br>that I've referred to heads and kind of<br>these you can find it in a bookstore<br>here on campus but it is available<br>online for free so I'm Michael be but<br>I'm actually learn super spirit online<br>easy exists and both options are<br>available to you exhausted as well don't<br>change so I did you a magician like I<br>skip it<br>yes they're gonna say some students even<br>through the provision and everything for<br>the online so just do it includes for<br>you<br>mental course materials the catalog of<br>papers is on the main website and you<br>can access this check out all of the<br>papers that are made with University any<br>23 year this is also a good pace from<br>time point about mind and doodle<br>come on to the catalog of papers search<br>using it in a petticoat or inch model<br>and you can bring up the information<br>about the paper that way and it's not a<br>good way to check things like outline<br>the dates for the cause was to be<br>expected fees<br>it also has links to a weekly schedule<br>of entities and that's going to show you<br>when your literature is out and each<br>week you know tutorials for each stream<br>are available and that's how I would<br>personally go in to check out unless you<br>throw it on the table so your table is<br>available on your classes are going to<br>standing Smith very exciting the<br>lectures are going to be made available<br>online a few hours after an interesting<br>place now as I'm sure you want to leave<br>right now the covered 19 situations<br>change how to do things and so the<br>Alysha is going to be available online<br>for you and your workshops and tutorials<br>will be available often and it blended<br>with it so you'll have on campus<br>tutorials and workshops and that there<br>will be an option to index online as<br>well and so the information that we're<br>seeing that's and in all circumstances<br>but the special circumstances that we<br>are in right now is that you'll have all<br>of your lectures online yeah and so the<br>morning with constant wanting lectures<br>and tutorials but normally to me<br>inspiring power and so let's start on<br>the hour and not finish few minutes to<br>the hour so that starts at 8:00 if it's<br>a one-hour little tutorial or started a<br>and finishing to mine now this would<br>normally give you time to pick up<br>yourself across campus to your next room<br>or engineering class and obviously<br>that's not going to be an issue for you<br>online right just to be aware that this<br>is still how we do things you say yes it<br>has tutorials operator and then you'll<br>afternoon classes operates the slowly<br>differently those that team has me Alan<br>and I'll finish on the a believe it is<br>if militias are two or more hours long<br>fear is normally a great pathway soon<br>so you're teaching rooms are going to be<br>located at different places around the<br>university generally speaking and we<br>don't do a lot of teaching and you look<br>just they're all built in but most of<br>your lectures will take place when<br>they're back on campus and I'll drop<br>this book so again right now you don't<br>have to worry about those Knicks rooms<br>because lectures adamantly available<br>online but normally most of your<br>lectures will take place in our book or<br>this book and they are built in spite of<br>millimeters the tutorial teams take by<br>the in their own campuses I don't really<br>have anywhere that you are looking at<br>tutorial times they get you home in a<br>building instance I always get lost and<br>they can return them<br>yeah so there's Ken's nip available<br>online to get stuck on oh I use the<br>beauty x and there will be a chemist<br>name at the end of these slides so if<br>you change your mind which happens or if<br>you're unsure about paper and you want<br>to withdraw you have a specific amount<br>of time through weeks in there to<br>withdraw out of the paper before you<br>incur fees any changes after the second<br>Friday of the training studies 5:00 p.m.<br>on a second Friday changes after that<br>may incur a fee the type of thing and<br>you do have to apply for withdrawal in<br>supply evidence for it so you've got<br>until the 24th of July so change your<br>moment if you decide it's not for you<br>but please I encourage you to come and<br>have a chat with us any one of those<br>Edmonds members come and have a chat<br>with us about your options the<br>implications of any changes that you<br>want to make and I'll see if we can help<br>you out before you have to do anything<br>like that so there's a link here in this<br>PowerPoint which has more information<br>here at the University of Waikato and<br>it's been a faculty at all we have<br>what's called special considerations it<br>is form to an application news for tests<br>with an m-class or my mind where you've<br>been infected by something and it has<br>impunity your ability to serve a test or<br>that you've missed it completely now<br>these implications a special<br>consideration application has to be made<br>within 72 hours of the time of victories<br>so but then a few days following tests<br>if there had been and special<br>circumstances where years is appended<br>your ability so that is we encourage you<br>to please submit a special consideration<br>the forms can be found on the student<br>landing page on the main website under<br>forms and there has to be filled out it<br>seems to lure dr. Jeannette white cuts<br>although AC dot NZ ends with all of your<br>evidence so you must provide other<br>source of what your application there<br>isn't any set rules of evidence so but<br>to give you an example if you have a<br>bereavement and the family and that's<br>caused into message here so that you've<br>got a performance against what we might<br>actually supply is a copy of the notice<br>or its certificate or something to<br>indicate that that was your situation at<br>the time and we understand though that<br>this obviously on case-by-case basis so<br>whatever the situation and provide some<br>evidence it will definitely have the<br>application out and to process them as<br>well there are two options on the CMP in<br>this case and so you'll hear more<br>information on the form once that has<br>been submitted out he needs to work with<br>sending it off to whoever needs to<br>consider and other Mitchell's and<br>once they have the outcome students will<br>be notified by email so you'll be told<br>the outcome of your application as soon<br>as that convenes<br>advices the cabining you also have what<br>we call extensions so if you for<br>whatever reason are unable to complete<br>your assessment and by the due dates you<br>have the option to apply for an<br>extension now these are here there are a<br>range of reasons why you might need an<br>extension and these also require you to<br>submit some evidence for that reason the<br>difference with an extension is that you<br>must either the extension and prior to<br>the due date so the extension request<br>cannot be processed after Angeline's<br>past so if you've got a situation and we<br>can't finish this by the due date<br>by Friday person or whatever it is in<br>please apply for an image and submit it<br>and he and to Lord our perception and<br>wants a lot easier yet with your your<br>evidence and then that will be<br>considered by our associate dean<br>undergraduate you know mr. Campion<br>should consider the application and it<br>lays out Edmonton who will then advise<br>students about the outcome but they'll<br>be doing colleges to apply for either an<br>extension or special consideration if it<br>applies to find out other information<br>about the faculty in law to stay in<br>touch we have a Facebook page if you<br>haven't already please go ahead and
