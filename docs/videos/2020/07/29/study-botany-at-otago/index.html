The University of Otago is one of the world’s leading universities. Experience it for yourself by studying Botany at Otago: https://www.otago.ac.nz/subjects/btny.html?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=subjects_playlist&utm_term=none&utm_content=none</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so I'm Laura and I studied botany in<br>particular forests and I didn't know<br>what I wanted to study when I finished<br>school but I chose plants because they<br>just seemed interesting I didn't know<br>much about them and I really haven't<br>looked back since I love being outside<br>and learning about these things that we<br>know so little about and they're so<br>important to life on earth no Tiger is a<br>particularly good place to study plants<br>because we have access to a huge range<br>of different ecosystems there's<br>grasslands and beech forests and Central<br>Otago there's rainforests and fuel and<br>there's coastal systems right here in<br>Dunedin and food trips has been one of<br>the most exciting things getting out<br>there and seeing what plants are doing<br>in their natural environment hi guys my<br>name's Matt Mike I'm a lecturer in the<br>botany department at the University of<br>Otago and if you're interested in<br>studying botany then the University of<br>Otago is absolutely the place to do it<br>because it's the only University in New<br>Zealand where you can study quite good<br>so boughten is life on earth in terms of<br>plants and it's not an exaggeration to<br>say that plants are absolutely<br>fundamental to life ok so plants provide<br>the oxygen that we breathe and really<br>importantly for us they've formed the<br>basis of our food chains so there's<br>three plants that provide about 40% of<br>all the calories to humans which is a<br>huge proportion globally ok so plants a<br>fundamental clue to not only our life<br>but also to the life of all of the other<br>organisms in embody an ecosystem so<br>plants through the process of<br>photosynthesis convert sunlight to<br>energy and that provides all of the<br>energy that subsequent biological<br>processes are built on so these are<br>really important things to understand<br>and if you're interested in that then<br>then botany and interested in the<br>natural world then botany is a really<br>great thing to study<br>so if you study botany at Otago in the<br>first year you'll do a subject called<br>plants how they shape the world where<br>you learn about the diversity of plants<br>and and fungi and also learn about that<br>process of photosynthesis that's so<br>fundamental to life and you'll go on to<br>learn about plants and food so<br>agriculture and how agriculture is<br>actually important thing in our plants<br>or the basis of most agriculture you'll<br>also learn about aquatic botany so you<br>learn about plants in the ocean and in<br>particular facing tentacle organisms in<br>the ocean how they're fundamental to the<br>carbon cycle then you can go on to learn<br>more about agronomics and second year so<br>biotechnology and how things like<br>biofuels that created from plants and<br>how that's going to be a really<br>important way to reduce carbon in the<br>future and then in third year you go on<br>and learn more about plant ecology and<br>plant diversity generally and then<br>you've got the potential to go on and<br>learn and do more study in postgraduate<br>level as you hear from more in a minute<br>you can also go from undergraduate<br>straight out into the workforce and we<br>recently did some research that showed<br>us that where our graduates have gone<br>and we found that for example we've got<br>graduates and basically every council in<br>New Zealand that graduates at all the<br>crown research institutes in New Zealand<br>all of the universities and many other<br>universities around the world as well<br>we've also got graduates in all of the<br>Botanic Gardens so there's an incredible<br>range of careers that you can undertake<br>in botany and lots of graduates in in<br>other industries as well so in terms in<br>the in management and in the private<br>sector as well so if you want to study<br>botany come to a Targa it's a great</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
