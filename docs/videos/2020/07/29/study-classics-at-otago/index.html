Gwyneth McIntyre and I'm a senior<br>lecturer in the classics program here at<br>the University of Otago so classics is<br>the study of the language literature<br>history philosophy politics and<br>archaeology of the Greeks and Romans and<br>what this means is that our program<br>really complements other ba disciplines<br>and in fact many of our students pair<br>their ba with classics together with a<br>law degree so there's lots of<br>flexibility and there's lots of<br>intersection between what we do and what<br>other programs do and because we study<br>the language and literature of the<br>Greeks and Romans you can redo that all<br>in translation but we also teach ancient<br>Greek and Latin from scratch so if you<br>want to read the actual words left to us<br>by those societies that you can and if<br>you've had the luxury of doing Latin at<br>school we can fast-track you into upper<br>level language classes so you don't have<br>to start from scratch we're also lucky<br>here to have the otago museum which has<br>an excellent classics teaching<br>collection and many of the artifacts<br>from the Greeks and Romans do come into<br>our classrooms from that collection so<br>here at Otago we're known for our<br>teaching excellence<br>and in the last student survey done by<br>the quality advancement unit we ranked<br>highest in all eight of the teaching<br>categories surveyed we're also pleased<br>to announce that in the most recent Q s<br>World Rankings for university subjects<br>we are the top ranked classics program<br>in New Zealand and were one of the top<br>50 in the world as a first year student<br>coming to Otago you get to learn about<br>Greek mythology so how the Greeks talk<br>about their gods and their hero's but<br>also how they manipulate some of those<br>stories to suit their own political<br>agendas and construct local identities<br>you can be guided by our field<br>archaeologists through the monumental<br>buildings of the Greeks and Romans or if<br>you're interested to learn a little bit<br>more about some of the marginalized<br>groups in Roman society you can look at<br>the lives of slaves gladiators</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
