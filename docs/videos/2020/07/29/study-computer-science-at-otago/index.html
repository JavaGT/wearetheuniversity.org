font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i choose to come to otago to study<br>because<br>of the vibrant student culture and also<br>because of the rich history that dunedin<br>has<br>actually quite a few of the students<br>that study at the university i'm from<br>dunedin<br>and i think that's further validation<br>for how amazing it is to be a student<br>here<br>i actually didn't start off university<br>studying computer science<br>i was studying something else in my<br>first year but then after that i made<br>the switch to computer science and i<br>haven't looked back<br>ever since the transition was really<br>smooth and i wrote my first line of code<br>at university<br>so why did i choose to study computer<br>science there are quite a few reasons<br>the main reason is that we are currently<br>living in a digital age<br>and there is no doubt that technology<br>will shape the future<br>so i believe that by studying about it<br>we can know more about what's happening<br>and also contribute to shaping the<br>future<br>and that being said there's no surprise<br>that there is<br>high demand in tech skills at the moment<br>so that means that there are great<br>career prospects<br>so you don't have to be a software<br>engineer and just work in tech for<br>example<br>you can also create your own startup or<br>if you want a corporate role you can<br>also become a consultant<br>and on a more personal note what i like<br>about computer science is that involves<br>a lot more problem solving and thinking<br>as opposed to just reading chunks of<br>text in the textbook and memorizing them<br>i'm michael albert i'm the head of the<br>department of computer science here at<br>the university of otago<br>i just want to tell you a little bit<br>about our department the things we do<br>and what you might be able to expect<br>from us if you come to study here<br>one of the things i really love about<br>working computer science is that<br>anything you can imagine doing you can<br>try to do in a computer<br>you don't have to worry about a machine<br>breaking or a lab blowing up or anything<br>like that<br>you can just do it try it out if it<br>doesn't work try something else<br>that's not to say we don't work on lots<br>of important problems as well<br>so one of our lecturers dr alex<br>graveskin<br>is working in the biological data<br>science institute and one of the things<br>that he works on is trying to<br>model the mutations in cancer cells and<br>in viruses<br>and the problem here is not that we<br>don't have enough data to do the<br>problems but that we have too much data<br>and we constantly get more data<br>and all the old models need to be<br>restarted every time you add data<br>and that's really really expensive so<br>he's looking at means by which we can<br>modify existing models with new data<br>without having to restart the process as<br>a whole<br>another area we're looking at is facial<br>recognition in sheep<br>which may seem like a weird question but<br>when you're trying to breed better sheep<br>you really want to know<br>who their parents are and the only way<br>to do that now is to actually do genetic<br>testing and again that's something<br>that's relatively expensive<br>but if you could just by looking at<br>photos of the sheep trying to identify<br>the ram and the you that sire that that<br>were their parents<br>then you'd be able to analyze your stock<br>much more much more easily and that<br>would allow you to get<br>good progress on developing better<br>better livestock which obviously is an<br>important thing<br>in the new zealand economy so this is<br>just a couple of areas that we work in<br>and there's lots of other<br>uh interesting projects going on in the<br>department as well<br>so what will you what you'll see if you<br>come to study computer science at otago<br>well we've got a brand new curriculum<br>that's rolling out starting in 2021<br>we've completely revamped our curriculum<br>to bring it more up to date<br>in the first year in the computer<br>science department you'll study two<br>you'll take two papers which are<br>fundamentally programming papers<br>now computer science isn't all about<br>programming but there's no denying that<br>programming is an important part of it<br>so we really want you to get started<br>with that solid foundation there<br>these are assessed using something we<br>call a mastery model which is slightly<br>somewhat self-paced you get to try a<br>succession of tests to make sure that<br>you're keeping up to date<br>and that stops you from getting<br>overwhelmed<br>computer science has links with all the<br>other disciplines in the sciences and<br>many of the disciplines in the<br>humanities<br>there's lots of interesting things to<br>work on and it doesn't hurt that it's<br>always easy to get a good job<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
