everyone<br>my name is gary i<br>am one of the co-presidents of the<br>mission society if you're unfamiliar<br>with what mooching is as i was when i<br>was in my first year<br>it is basically a simulated court<br>environment so<br>you're a lawyer you have to go to court<br>and represent a client<br>who in a lot of cases has probably done<br>something wrong<br>and you have to present their case in<br>front of actual<br>judges if you're lucky enough to make it<br>to the finals<br>you will very likely be mooting in the<br>auckland high court<br>in front of actual auckland high court<br>judges which is just<br>an incredible opportunity you get to<br>learn substantive skills that you would<br>never learn in class<br>really niche interesting areas of war<br>but also test those formative skills as<br>well<br>while liaising with real judges real<br>lawyers<br>and real senior law students who you<br>might not meet otherwise<br>it's really easy to get involved all you<br>need to do is<br>go onto our website uoa meeting.com</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
