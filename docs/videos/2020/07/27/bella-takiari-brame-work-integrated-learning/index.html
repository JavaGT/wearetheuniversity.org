you<br>could just explain a little bit about<br>yourself and what you do ten-nine Coto<br>Cabella Takeo d-branes we'll go anyway<br>thank you Kandra for your lovely<br>introduction and what I do as a<br>professional director I sit on a few<br>boards some of them nationally some of<br>them locally some of them for my Eyrie<br>more it's more sitting at governance<br>level and thinking more from a strategic<br>perspective of course and then<br>operationally I'm currently acting chief<br>executive for money portal Maori Trust<br>Board we have beneficiary base of about<br>35,000 currently asset base of about 40<br>million so I better work to do but I<br>guess that's where I find a good balance<br>between working strategically and<br>working operationally as well yeah<br>awesome um and I guess as a result of<br>climate you may have been spending more<br>time at home have you had to change or<br>adapt or pick up any new skills from<br>working remotely yeah I think if you<br>were to ask everyone what was your first<br>week of lockdown like absolute chaos<br>yeah<br>all of a sudden having running running a<br>team of approximately 30 to 40 people<br>depending on who's part-time and<br>full-time suddenly having to oversee<br>them virtually alongside having your<br>kids at home doing the school work<br>alongside did also haven't have space to<br>do his work it was a bit chaotic but you<br>know within the first week we found our<br>balance found our roles found our<br>boundaries and from the ER on you know<br>it was a little bit of her to miss on<br>the school week I'm sure everyone would<br>I'm up there but you know I was and I<br>always reflect on this no university<br>degree that I have done I've done a few<br>could have prepared me for running an<br>organization from lock down that would<br>be really tell<br>yeah but you know at the end of the day<br>the bigger the best school that you<br>could have had was flexibility and<br>adaptability and just thinking not<br>overthinking it just going with the flow<br>really and so what do you suggest for a<br>new graduate or someone who's looking to<br>enter the workforce how they can<br>navigate the crisis and getting hired I<br>think and I did reflect on this question<br>but overnight I think either way when<br>you've got good work ethic you're gonna<br>get a job no matter what what it's like<br>you know whether we're in a recession or<br>whether things are booming if you turn<br>up in time you're reliable and you say<br>what you're gonna say you say you do<br>what you say you're going to do and you<br>know it's probably described as working<br>at a high level or integrity and also<br>when you don't understand things<br>escalating that straightaway and asking<br>questions you know when I hire someone I<br>can read that straight away but I guess<br>that's experience but anybody that's<br>going to be interviewing our new<br>graduates will definitely be able to<br>read that and it will also reflect on<br>perhaps the CV that you put forward I<br>know some students come in a university<br>with a but a work experience some don't<br>but you know demonstrate in anyway we<br>you have your completely reliable and<br>your good communicator I think<br>well-rounded just demonstrate that you<br>can do this the other thing is really<br>demonstrate your know-how with<br>technology that will get you the job<br>because right now I always like me I'm<br>up for anyone that can show me a new way<br>of doing things and alongside that I<br>think it is important to be clear on the<br>why hmm no matter what you to not to<br>interview you be clear on why you want<br>to<br>if you don't want the job as the person<br>interviewing it's gonna seal it straight<br>away you know if your head on my side oh<br>no I'm thinking about doing something<br>else so I've got another one to be<br>somewhere else that's fine but just you<br>know fake it to make it<br>probably that what I hear you want the<br>job you are clear on the way and you're<br>clear on you know what this way this<br>organization and what it's going to do<br>for you and what you're going to do for<br>the organization so you know be well<br>prepared and with that frame of mind be<br>prepared to do anything two or three<br>years just a little warning it's not<br>going to be or office job this job you<br>know sitting pretty you just need to<br>prepared to do the hard stuff yeah<br>that's really good advice and I think<br>particularly at the moment because the<br>job market is quite tight and should<br>instead of coming out of university<br>probably going to have to look for those<br>sorts of roles<br>to get into the workforce so that makes<br>complete sense and I mean that<br>demonstrates we'll be a thicker is that<br>as well you know when I see a CV and I'm<br>like oh well you know I won't name jobs<br>but you go oh well you stuck to that and<br>I know that can be quite a hard thing to<br>do<br>especially when you're so well educated<br>but it just shows me you know you've got<br>tenacity you're consistent you're<br>determined all those great qualities in<br>your graduate yeah that's cool and there<br>any additional avenues you think<br>graduates should be looking to try and<br>don't underestimate the well-rounded<br>experience even voluntary yep um I think<br>that is key you know more already<br>encouraging my children just to go and<br>do anything to help others<br>you know the whole well-being focus the<br>whole sustainability focus as the way<br>the world is heading you know you can<br>demonstrate that you know you're<br>passionate around the environment and<br>you know you've gone and planted trees<br>you know that that really stepped out<br>especially in that we're common with<br>anyway at the moment of culturally you<br>can demonstrate that you can speak<br>different languages when I was in London<br>I hired people most Seabees how people<br>could speak four languages Wow yeah and<br>you know everyone was more to lingual I<br>know New Zealand that's a Hamas everyone<br>yeah<br>so you know be open to learning other<br>languages not you know New Zealand has<br>Maori Pacific island in English you know<br>be open to other things we only<br>experience you know be more worldly does<br>appeal to me personally give enough<br>spend a bit of time globally I think<br>that just won't won't hurt at all of<br>course it's graduates you know I had a<br>travel of the world but when I say<br>weirdly be open to knowing things around<br>what's happening around the world yeah<br>and just like it's the empathy around<br>different cultures as well yeah yeah<br>it's lately so being what I call<br>environmentally culturally all those I<br>guess these all these well-being factors<br>that need to be conscious of knowing<br>that the struggles of demographics is<br>probably important too and this you know<br>the kind of benefits you can get out of<br>fallen tree I said on a homeless shelter<br>as a trustee I've only just started<br>there this year I've learnt so much I've<br>learnt so much around the struggles that<br>some of people in our community here you<br>know it's those kind of experience that<br>just make you more well-rounded yeah so<br>you're supposed to be the sorts of<br>characteristics you look for you know<br>that make students stand out<br>absolutely absolutely let's go what<br>would your top three tips be to a<br>graduate who's looking to be interviewed<br>post : yeah I mean I will still<br>emphasize the why<br>I know the way why you're there our way<br>you'd want to do what you do want to do<br>and know why this organization suits you<br>in again I'd say if you just don't find<br>a job just fake it to make up it's<br>probably the first thing technology<br>definitely highlight your knowledge of<br>technology it is the way that we orders<br>in it I don't think it's going to change<br>back in any way soon and it doesn't hurt<br>to come to an interview with new ideas<br>innovation innovative linking depending<br>on what the job is of course you know<br>you've got to use your intuition but it<br>doesn't hurt to sort of talk to two or<br>three people that you see as mentors<br>around you know what this is a job I<br>want how do you think I should prepare<br>for it your mentor should know what<br>types of questions you will be asked if<br>you're prepared with those types of<br>questions every interview and I'm still<br>going to interviews in you know I'm<br>still really nervous but the thing that<br>I've found that's really really helped<br>me as know the questions that are going<br>to be asked and know how to ask them and<br>it's always the why what experience do<br>you have<br>tell us about how would you you know<br>usually it's around working with a<br>difficult person watch your team work<br>like are you you know are you<br>collaborative teamwork collaboration is<br>key going forward for this covert<br>process that's cool so in what ways his<br>your workplace employees had to operate<br>differently I mean obviously it's hard<br>to have that kind of collaboration not<br>being in the office but the massive ways<br>you've tried to combat that yeah well<br>given you know we Maori we had daily<br>Couric here every morning so that's<br>always 9:00 a.m. so it has many benefits<br>when we come together and we start our<br>day and on a positive note<br>in this also it allows me as the CEO to<br>chicken on everyone I can see their<br>faces I can see how that you know if<br>they don't do not it will be where as<br>such and such so you notice these daily<br>well-being checks as well alongside that<br>and at the same time it just allows us<br>to come together think about what our<br>day entails and get on with our day<br>because you know that's one thing<br>working virtually you do not have human<br>interaction and apart from your own<br>family and there that kind of daily<br>get-together is enabled us to be a but<br>human you know I see other humans in you<br>know usually we have a bit of a gossip<br>see what everyone has been up to so you<br>know that has been with me that's been<br>amazing and in terms of coming together<br>also all staff meetings I and instigated<br>every two weeks at least we will come<br>together I think about you know updating<br>everyone on you know what alert levels<br>we are at what that means whether<br>there's going to be any changes going<br>forward so it was something that you<br>know we came together but also I always<br>found it really effective to ask a<br>question like you know how are you<br>coping you know any and you know what's<br>one thing that you're tell everyone<br>that's really weak for you and so that<br>was one question or ask everyone anyone<br>will go around around the table around<br>the screen and answer that question<br>I found immediately by the way that the<br>person us ask the question I answered<br>the question whether I had a well-being<br>issue yeah so health and safety you know<br>with all organizations has been key<br>throughout this so I found those forums<br>absolutely essential and of course<br>you're here to delegate delegate the<br>managers to always chicken with their<br>people you know working in isolation<br>most had their families and some didn't<br>by themselves and you know it was just<br>making sure<br>daily that they were okay yeah at the<br>same time a great initiative that we<br>stood up when I say stood up in the<br>first week of lockdown we just created<br>and it wasn't what we usually do is<br>provide food packs Wow unity and<br>alongside what we had record a call<br>center so we were calling people and our<br>tribal database to see if they were okay<br>and we started with our comb Ottawa or<br>our over 55 and we also were able to<br>identify the air whether we had<br>well-being issues of our people and were<br>able to escalate if required to the<br>various essential services that were<br>around and also and you know finding<br>volunteers to go and deliver the food<br>you know it was quite hectic the first<br>two weeks I'm here doing something that<br>we don't usually do but I just felt<br>natural to do it you know by the end of<br>alert three looks readable we had<br>delivered over a thousand food packs<br>across the community yeah and we've<br>called over a thousand people and yeah<br>so we've been able to get a good sense<br>of where our community is it it's been a<br>strong strategic move on our behalf<br>because I guess we've got information<br>that a lot of organizations never hear<br>before if you know the government<br>agencies from a well in perspective as<br>not information that we're in we can we<br>can use but we know intuitively where<br>there might be vulnerable --'tis in our<br>community and we can help them<br>accordingly yeah that's amazing to start<br>up a new connect in a global pandemic<br>yeah and virtually you know as you know<br>you know running a whole covert response<br>for<br>thousands of people so long side that we<br>were with the DHB here running mobile<br>units for flu vaccinations and Seebeck<br>testing through to the remote areas and<br>the uptake was amazing so now in terms<br>of our flu vaccinations compared to any<br>to history we've got the highest number<br>of uptake from Marty that's awesome yeah<br>well son there's just some hiring I love<br>hearing that yeah I mean it's been very<br>fulfilling for me personally you know<br>when you know that you're helping others<br>and making a difference<br>it's oh it's so nice let's just actually<br>made my day thanks with it and Ollie we<br>have done it you know it's a real<br>strength and alongside and I think one<br>thing that's been cares collaboration in<br>working with other networks as a we're<br>here and the wycott so of course we've<br>got this natural affiliation is here we<br>they've come from Tony Walker<br>or you know the canoe that's come from<br>Hawaii way back and potentially 12 1200<br>1300 ad but there the alignment the<br>genealogy it's proper we call it<br>all those ami that have come from time<br>we worker we call them have come<br>together and you know was the unity is<br>stronger than ever you know we worked<br>closely with Nate edokko up with workers<br>retiring in our hotaki tribes and so<br>that covered an extensive area of this<br>community and we we duplicated those<br>services so he was we were able to be<br>more effective so you've done quite<br>obviously quite specific networking<br>during the pandemic have you found it<br>changed much because of that or is it<br>similar<br>oh it's a it's I guess it's a<br>yes on the Erie side but working with<br>civil defense and councils that's come<br>that's stronger than ever and then of<br>course the government agencies and I<br>guess we're there's a real appreciation<br>for the strengths we all have and you<br>know we don't say house response as<br>opposed to economic response I think<br>we're all in this together<br>lives are at stake I think economic<br>since you know we're heading into that<br>now you know things we whatever will get<br>that's cool um so I guess that's<br>everything I had prepared but is there<br>anything you want to tell our graduates<br>we've got a lot of students I guess<br>looking to finish their studies this<br>year and looking to move into the<br>workforce yeah I think I mean I really<br>pick when I was a graduate and I was<br>very nice around what was coming I sit<br>here now<br>30 years later and I can reflect they<br>can think okay what pills of wisdom can<br>I pass down to our graduates be<br>open-minded be edge I'll be flexible and<br>I just repeat myself<br>be prepared to do anything well thank<br>you so much for your time this morning<br>it's been lovely to meet you<br>I definitely have learned a lot from you<br>myself and I'm sure that our students<br>really appreciate the advice you've<br>brought with him I wish you all the best<br>and hopefully we cross paths in person<br>someday yes thank you and yes we love<br>you to me here we do all in person and<br>you</p></main><footer
