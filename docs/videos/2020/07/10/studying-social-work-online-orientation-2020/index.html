morning welcome everyone welcome to<br>the students so basically this webinar<br>is for students who are enrolled in<br>Medicaid or considering enrolling in<br>Medicaid so currently the campus but in<br>saying that you can actually do some of<br>the papers under this degree in the<br>Hamilton campus the better props of your<br>degree is basically available as a<br>specific program in the Tonga campus<br>which may be awarded corners this is<br>basically a four-year portion or begin<br>which is by the social workers<br>Registration Board in New Zealand so<br>that basically means once you finish<br>this qualification you will be eligible<br>to register or curve in to Xena this<br>also means that to this qualification is<br>recognized in Australia and that's<br>mainly because of the trans-tasman<br>agreement between the Australian<br>Association of Social Work they're<br>sending new student registration so when<br>you finish this course in kitchen you<br>can take this qualification to Australia<br>and practice there as a social worker<br>without any further credential so as I<br>said earlier this is a four year degree<br>so each year full-time students are<br>supposed to do hundred and twenty points<br>and in ndm-1 terms are equal to eight<br>compulsory papers and then in here the<br>children's are recorded through seven<br>compulsory papers and it goes like that<br>the most important part of this degree<br>comes in year three and year four and<br>thence when this problems not going for<br>their practice placements in Social Work<br>agencies mainly<br>in the area but also in other parts of<br>the country so that means we have a<br>balance of found theory and practice and<br>each placements in year three and year<br>four are normally population of 60 days<br>if your time student so in terms of what<br>is Social Work social is basically a<br>practice based promotion but it is also<br>academic discipline that promotes social<br>change social cohesion and also a<br>permanent liberation of cable and<br>basically social workers are supposed to<br>engage with the people their families<br>and their communities and also social<br>structures 200c life challenges people<br>have to address the well-being needs and<br>also promote their self-determination<br>and autonomy and in doing this movie in<br>this work what we focus is the<br>principles of social justice economic<br>and human rights collectivist<br>responsibility and respect for diversity<br>so essentially now we know to practice<br>as a social or probably work with<br>individuals we work with the groups we<br>put the families and we also work with<br>the communities so it's a very diverse<br>ocean and when you practice as a social<br>worker you know opportunities are quite<br>wide and the social workers can work in<br>need of statutory or statutory<br>organisations and looking at the trends<br>in terms of where all branches of<br>working<br>video for graduates are working with the<br>Ministry of especially the monarchy and<br>the deposit is used to be known as<br>genuine family and also students work in<br>other statutory organisations like to<br>many of us from sports or work in<br>organizations like department of<br>conscience and other organizations are<br>nonprofit organizations so you would be<br>able to work in these nonprofit<br>organizations and statutory<br>organisations are social workers and<br>most of the time the title of the job is<br>like human service or or youth worker so<br>basically your qualification to work<br>with individuals and families and clues<br>in some settings but also with the<br>community at large<br>so opportunities are available about the<br>news in and out also in overseas so we<br>do have working yes<br>practicing social lives in other<br>countries like UK for example so there's<br>no audience skills you gain from this<br>degree so in terms of studying normally<br>we encourage students to start their<br>studies in our trimester<br>starting in March and just reading for<br>time because it's a very personal degree<br>so that we can meet any requirements and<br>it would take four years to complete<br>this study is very full time and if<br>you're part I mean this could take<br>and as I mentioned before in the year<br>three and year four students would be<br>going to different social service<br>agencies to do their placements and most<br>of the time many ministers do find<br>employment from their placements so the<br>placement Norway becomes at the end of<br>the placement the admission to the<br>social program is by selection<br>basically the<br>the process is actually over at the<br>moment<br>and we encourage students to submit<br>their applications by October because<br>there's a certain process which might<br>include an interview an individual<br>interview but the other requirements are<br>students in addition to their normal<br>application control at the university<br>they need to submit a supreme every<br>application form for BSW and they also<br>need to provide a statement of why they<br>want to be a saloon student and they<br>also need to consent to put is fitting<br>so basically to be admitted into the<br>social program as a social student the<br>program needs to ensure that you are a<br>fit and proper person to practice on<br>social work and that's why we have to do<br>the participative process so the<br>participating process happens before you<br>come into the program anyone<br>and it also get repeated in year three<br>and year four before the placement<br>because before you go on placement in<br>year three and year the form you need to<br>ensure that you are at same person to<br>practice with the children not know the<br>children sang 2014 so when we look for<br>information with the participating<br>process the claims like legislation's<br>who are applying to social work so<br>basically all the convictions would be<br>listed in the participating in favor any<br>convictions so essentially the program<br>is to conduct that fit and proper<br>assessment before we can offer a place<br>in the program but in saying that having<br>a conviction is not necessarily a<br>problem for gaining initiative program<br>if you have a conversation with you<br>about<br>which you might have so that way we have<br>on this version of the interview process<br>so all applications will be I'm<br>concerned by a case-by-case basis some<br>so there are few steps some if you're<br>planning to I'm coming into the program<br>and if you're not already in the program<br>so step one is obviously applying to<br>inform and then receive a conditional<br>offer and then step two is completing<br>the online we establish the primary<br>application and providing the porous<br>fitting for and confirm and the step<br>three is not every students are meeting<br>in tribute then if people have any and<br>there was an interview needed that<br>normally happens sometime in that would<br>be simple and then you know based on<br>that that process in a you'll be offered<br>a place at the program and so that it<br>can start your studies in March so<br>that's how the program goes and<br>sometimes students some wanting control<br>in be is debris and sometimes they do<br>miss they have deadlines or they want to<br>enroll in<br>try mr. B and if that's the case<br>normally what we do is they will<br>initially be enrolled in the social<br>sciences but they will be doing all the<br>papers in social and of the university<br>or then they will go through these<br>sectional process and but into the<br>social program so we we do say that you<br>know life is either a daring adventure<br>or which is nothing<br>and so we will recommend that be big<br>bearing and be a social worker<br>so so that's basically all I have to say<br>both to be sociable program and I'm<br>happy to answer any question you might<br>have<br>thank you okay<br>so we have to go steal some that came up<br>so the first one is how do I find<br>placement so that basically a program<br>process so what normally happens is at<br>the end of year two we send some<br>documentation to the students you know<br>in terms of where they want to go and<br>based on those reference and students do<br>it today different agencies the program<br>actually down negotiate the placements<br>with the agencies and it's from scalable<br>ways their preference but the program<br>actually organizes it so that the second<br>question is do I need any previous<br>experience to apply for Social Work you<br>know but if you have any more than three<br>experience or any sort of similar<br>experience like being a youth worker<br>time that would be pretty good but for<br>admission purposes you don't really need<br>any previous experience to apply for<br>Social Work should we stay there so much<br>time to see now and if you have any<br>questions about studying social work<br>please get in touch with the program the<br>program can advise you about the program</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
