a<br>little bit more around the student visas<br>for you as well today so you must hold a<br>valid visa through your study period<br>here at Waikato if you do not renew your<br>visa before it expires unfortunately you<br>won't become unlawful in New Zealand and<br>your enrollment will be restored<br>cancelled by one of our University staff<br>and make sure you enroll full-time in<br>each semester that normally means a<br>minimum three papers third trimester at<br>undergraduate level and if you change<br>your program of study make sure you<br>change your visa to match the new<br>program as well I'll just give you an<br>example if you are studying Bachelor of<br>Management Studies taste chemistry and<br>next year you want to change the<br>Bachelor of business make sure you<br>change your reason to match the new<br>qualification as well because when you<br>change your qualification they missed<br>your current way sir has expired and<br>very good thing is we have an on-campus<br>with the renewal services for you you<br>can make appointment at the Student<br>Center or renewed during our drop-in<br>times at the beginning of each semester<br>normally it is faster and cheaper that<br>applying directly to immigration is in<br>it but if you want to apply for the visa<br>new on canvas make sure you submit your<br>application at least seven days before<br>your current visa expiry date otherwise<br>after seven days you will have to apply<br>directly to immigration visa online if<br>you have any questions around visas we<br>have a visa officers from our team her<br>name is Alice Donohue<br>if you got any questions make sure you<br>email email us - visa at Waikato or a<br>seed or insane and Alice will be able to<br>respond to you as soon as possible and<br>next part we'll talk about medical and<br>travel insurance which is very important<br>for our international students as well<br>so all international students must have<br>medical and travel insurance<br>the reason is international students are<br>not entitled to publicly funded health<br>services so the insurance will make sure<br>you will not end up paying not money for<br>many holy travel expenses and most of<br>you will have the University policy<br>students say insurance is attached in<br>your ear omen some of you might have<br>other policies for example certain gross<br>we have a lease of alternative insurance<br>provider on our website as well if you<br>won't have a look<br>and please radio policy information very<br>carefully it doesn't matter which<br>insurance provider anyways so you are<br>aware of what you are current and what<br>you can cancel we will give you a little<br>bit more information in the following<br>part regarding what is in power and what<br>is actually if you have family members<br>with you in New Zealand we recommend<br>today are also covered as well for the<br>same reason they are not entitled to<br>public for the health services so if you<br>are interested and your family members<br>covered come and talk to us if you need<br>if you're if you insurance provider is<br>students.they your policy number is your<br>student ID and hope hopefully you can<br>see the QR code on this slide so this QR<br>code will give you access to how to make<br>a crime and your policy information as<br>well and also by scanning this QR code<br>it give you the certificate of insurance<br>and on the left hand side you can see<br>there's insurance booklet which we can<br>grab from the Student Center level to a<br>friend disk I also have the QR code<br>inside this booklet as well so as part<br>of the policy you agreeing that the you<br>make a claim for personal possessions<br>you will pay a SSP so what is an<br>insurance excess excess is the moment<br>that you contribute to a plan and the<br>insurance boat insurance company will<br>cover the remaining about so the purpose<br>of insurance access is to help a<br>one-to-many small plans which will<br>increase premiums for everyone who is<br>insured the other term to be aware of is<br>depreciation depreciation is the<br>reduction in value of the item over time<br>so after a year is not going to be worth<br>the same as it was when you first bought<br>it right so I would like to give you an<br>example of just let's say if you lost a<br>laptop and how much the new shirt the<br>wider were paid so let's say you have a<br>12 mass over the laptop and cost two<br>grand when you bother<br>and unfortunately the leftover is I was<br>and the way you make the claim to the<br>insurance company because it's been 12<br>months old so I will be a 30% less<br>depreciation or reduction and we worked<br>on is around 600 orders and the excess<br>we normally is 200 orders so you will be<br>liable for this to ended ordinances to<br>be as well<br>so and it very and if the insurance<br>company a perfume club they will pay you<br>$1200 so what I suggest is definitely<br>make some do some copulation before you<br>make the crime so you know exactly how<br>much the insurance company will pay so<br>we have at least of nominated insurance<br>will cover so they will cover the<br>general medical cost some prescription<br>costs as well and the travel insurance<br>and they also cover emergency den<br>history that is normally up to five it<br>was over a year and if you're wearing<br>glasses they will pay you up to two<br>hundred dollars to replace your glasses<br>for a year and some personal events are<br>covered as well and they also over one<br>sexual health consultation per year and<br>then it will also cover the fly spoon in<br>case of an emergency however there will<br>be some conditions that high but I would<br>like to point out this is this is just a<br>general list you need to check your own<br>insurance provider and your own policy<br>because there might be some difference<br>between each policies and your insurance<br>will not cover any illness you had<br>before coming to New Zealand this moment<br>called pre-existing conditions for<br>example if you have back problems for<br>years it is unlikely to be covered by<br>your insurance provider<br>and they will not cover pregnancy<br>conscious nation however there will be<br>there will be limited powerful or<br>sexually transmitted infections and if<br>you need to visit your dentist regularly<br>they will not curve for this cost as<br>well and apparently they won't cover for<br>extreme sports for example Benjie German<br>and if you have a car in New Zealand<br>make sure you buy a car insurance from<br>using an insurance provider because<br>these medical and travel insurance will<br>not cover your current damaged or stolen<br>and apparently you can't make like fake<br>claims to the insurance provider as well<br>they will not pay for them again if you<br>have any questions feel free to send us<br>to the chat box and that is more<br>response to you today otherwise place<br>email eientei the insurance advice total<br>a speedo and say and our insurance team<br>will be able to respond to you the next<br>part will show you some events and<br>tricks that we are planning to house for<br>this trimester so International Day is<br>one of our biggest events that we call<br>every year and this year it will be on<br>Wednesday is stamens of October and<br>British bring this on campus event is to<br>acknowledge and celebrate the diversity<br>on Congress and the valuable<br>contribution of our international<br>students to the University so you can<br>have a taste of different countries food<br>on the day I will have some cultural<br>performance arts and crafts on site as<br>well we strongly encourage you to wear<br>your national choice to join the parade<br>and we'll have a five-kilometer car<br>ready at the very end so I'm pretty sure<br>you will get a lot of fan from this<br>event so make sure you follow us on<br>Facebook to get more information about<br>the International Day or what if we send<br>your reminder closer to the day as well<br>and this trimester we'll organize<br>another muhammara trip this the extra<br>data is still to be confirmed in all be<br>released on the Facebook so mana is a<br>traditional maori meeting house you will<br>have a organized a a tomorrow<br>we estimate cause around 80 bus to a<br>hundred and this include returned<br>transport accommodation museum workshops<br>which is a really good value so if you<br>want to find out some real news in<br>culture and history of Mali or even just<br>learn some famous haha and Wyatt has<br>more Nissan's make sure you join this<br>trip again follow us on Facebook and<br>we'll release more information about<br>description and we really know for our<br>new international students first year is<br>always tough you don't really know where<br>to go to see this beautiful country or<br>even raise the bar where's the best bar<br>in town or you might not fit into the<br>study so quickly so this is why we bring<br>up the idea of international body<br>program study about network they have<br>ruined this body programs successfully<br>for years so what happens you will be<br>paired up with an existing University<br>student who is very keen to help<br>international students to fit in a study<br>about network has a great aim to<br>organize lots of chips every year for<br>study both exchange students and also<br>for those who have joined this buddy<br>program so it is a great way to make<br>sure your Waikato experience is<br>enjoyable from the very beginning and I<br>strongly encourage encourage you to<br>apply for this program place email to<br>international support at blanket or<br>ACN's day if you would like to apply as<br>well there's an international body<br>program<br>and I'll quickly show you a short video<br>just to ensure the introduce the whole<br>student services division student<br>services division works with students<br>the wider University and the community<br>to offer a wide range of student<br>services so we should we start how about<br>at the heart seminar Student Center on<br>the Hamilton campus and the hub and<br>Turanga our student advisors in the<br>Student Center in the hub can help you<br>with all general inquiries as well as<br>enrollment student payments of<br>graduation examination and assessment<br>help we also support our students<br>well-being through the provision of<br>holistic services accessibility services<br>works collaboratively with students with<br>impairments to empower

health nurse counselors violence<br>prevention and health promotion<br>coordinators the unique is the gym on<br>the Hamilton campus no matter what<br>you're into they have it covered the<br>well-being hub is based in the station<br>on Hillcrest Road this is where you'll<br>also find the omen II Sports Arena along<br>with other support teams like future<br>students chaplaincy accommodation<br>systems and timetabling and<br>international student services we are a<br>caring team that cultivates a climate of<br>wellness and support now you're probably<br>thinking how can I remember all of us<br>well let's go back to the beginning the<br>team at the Student Center also filled<br>inquiries by phone so if you have any<br>questions simply call our 800 we're<br>cuttin okay so the Student Services<br>Division covers pretty much all services<br>you will need during your studies here<br>at like at all<br>and just like the video said a tellurian<br>if you don't know who to talk to always<br>come to the frankontour s Student Center<br>level 2 and the Student Center team<br>won't be able to find the right person<br>for you we hope your wife no journey is<br>enjoyable and we are doing our best to<br>make sure you well however if you have<br>some concerns that you want to raise<br>please please let us know so we can<br>investigate and put things right as soon<br>as possible here's how so if you have a<br>concern about any aspect of your<br>experience at the University you are<br>encouraged to speak directly with the<br>relevant staff member who is most<br>directly associated with the matter say<br>if they can help you however if this<br>doesn't doesn't really resolve your<br>concern or if the problem is more<br>serious you can follow the process to<br>make a formal complaint so step 1 view<br>in the student complaint form with the<br>details of your complainant this form<br>can be found from the University<br>calendar on our website said to me the<br>form to the relevant in or director<br>within three months of the problem<br>happening and the finest style in the<br>final style you will be otherwise of the<br>all-comers your complaint in writing<br>within 28 days some more information I<br>will<br>like to add in this part you might bring<br>a support person such as a friend family<br>member or even your homestay parents to<br>any meetings regarding your campaign and<br>you can escalate your campaign as well<br>if you are unhappy with the outcome of<br>your formal complaint<br>you can submit appeal to the senior<br>deputy Westchester and if used to<br>unhappy with the outcome of that appeal<br>you can then contact the New Zealand<br>qualifications Authority so this is a<br>government organization for ensuring<br>that we as a university fulfills is<br>responsibility under the code of<br>practice for international students and<br>before we move on to the New Zealand<br>culture section we would like to give<br>you some important information around<br>the change of the Romans<br>withdrawals and refunds so a change of<br>enrollment is to change your<br>qualifications or papers or it could be<br>adding or removing papers as well for<br>the next two weeks let's say if you find<br>out this is not something you want to<br>learn this year you can submit a change<br>of enrollment as please be aware this<br>has to be done by the 24th of July 5<br>p.m. and if you want to withdraw a paper<br>it's best to complain this completest<br>process within 14 days of the first day<br>for the beach hi Messer the first day is<br>Monday the 13th of July so this is to<br>make sure you can receive a refund of<br>your prescript face if you delay the<br>paper within 42 days old off and<br>including the first day of the relevant<br>teaching period there will be no refund<br>unfortunately please be aware this list<br>is not exhaustive because in this room<br>at the present I believe we have a wide<br>mix of<br>from Metro degrees to master degrees<br>I want you to do could be doing a<br>individual favor credits or 180 points<br>programs but that's major much majority<br>of you each can assess students so I<br>have provided information for that but<br>for Foley's please refer to the<br>University calendar on our website so<br>again there is a further information<br>available on the University calendar<br>which you can access online including<br>the abuse process for any declined<br>decisions so this one is just for for<br>you to to say if after the deadline for<br>deletion deletion always role if you<br>consider that you are unable to complete<br>a paper because of the certain certain<br>certain situation happen beyond your<br>control you may be able to apply in<br>writing to the Director of Student<br>Services for methylation always strolls<br>and normally we will require some<br>evidence for example like your medical<br>certificate to to be able to approve and<br>this will need to be submitted sir my<br>vital so again if you're not sure how do<br>you use my wife no yet talk to the<br>student center team another thing I<br>would like to just remind you the very<br>careful delayed any papers because your<br>student visa requires you to be in your<br>photon which is equivalent of three<br>papers in each trimester so normally you<br>need to make sure you have at least<br>three papers if you are doing better<br>degrade<br>so next part we'll talk about how do you<br>adjust to the New Zealand culture so is<br>anyone coming from a country like this<br>photo a night market with lots of choice<br>lots of people just there's so many<br>reasons to go outside in the main market<br>in the in night market during the<br>midnight oh oh it could be this<br>lots of motorbikes and current people on<br>the road that's to be pretty usual for<br>some of you to see in in a peak hours in<br>your home country so now let's see<br>meanwhile what you can expect in New<br>Zealand is lot of in fact we have<br>more shift than humans here and there<br>are lots of shape festivals around the<br>country as well for you to find out I'll<br>show you another photo so there was a<br>man reading the force and honouring<br>McDonough's takeaway in Lisbon you don't<br>see this too often these days now I<br>I'll show you some interesting TV years<br>as well I just give you some experience<br>about a little bit more of the cultural<br>difference<br>don't tell anyone after 30 times optical<br>zoom and full HD movie in photo Fuji<br>film digital cameras trumpet simplifying<br>summer how far away from the beach to<br>togs become undies skin tight swimming<br>togs and item of clothing you'd happily<br>wear in public but not in public so how<br>far is too far let's begin dogs dogs<br>dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs dogs<br>undies undies undies undies undies if<br>you can't see the water you're in<br>underpants local supermarkets pedestrian<br>crossings office buildings public<br>transport anywhere more than 300 meters<br>from the water's edge all Underpants<br>transformation areas if we treat the<br>budgie smuggler with respect undies<br>undies undies togs everyone wins<br>trouble simplifying summer one minute<br>time thank you<br>did you all please put down your pens<br>thank you well done thank you thank you<br>thank you<br>oh I'm sorry you're too late<br>I have your plenti fallings about time<br>you failed<br>sorry excuse me do you know who I am<br>so by playing the last part of video<br>with defens are encouraging you to do<br>the same thing in a university okay so<br>if you're feeling some part of these<br>photos and videos are quite unbelievable<br>or even bad so this means you might be<br>experience the quarter shock and this is<br>very normal and this is exactly why we<br>are here to advise you how to adjust use<br>a nun culture so we have a lease of<br>staff you perceive with your five senses<br>when you see these photos and videos for<br>example deserve food flex and music<br>holidays spectra but these are only top<br>of the iceberg as you can see and it<br>only takes a small part let's see what<br>is underneath the water so what do you<br>perceive underneath the water is a lot<br>more complex and difficult to perceive<br>with our senses with least five casings<br>this will actually tell whether you feel<br>this as a good or bad example or<br>unacceptable for example communication<br>styles and rules do you make eye contact<br>when you speak to someone in some<br>culture looking someone in the eye is<br>disrespectful but in other cultures if<br>you don't look them in the eye you're<br>not being honest or you have something<br>so to keep a culture a definition we<br>could say that culture is a shared<br>assumptions values and beliefs of a<br>group of people which resulting in the<br>correct correct correct heuristic<br>behaviors so culture affects what you<br>think say and do culture is learn a<br>shared culture is both visible and<br>invisible just like the iceberg because<br>people can't see the underneath<br>underneath the water we can only see the<br>top of the iceberg and culture is mostly<br>hidden as well and culture very is very<br>complex<br>even in New Zealand different community<br>have slightly different cultural values<br>as well so they either focus on<br>so the Pakeha in in other words is<br>European European New Zealanders and<br>they have a focus on individual rights<br>and the freedom well Molly commitment<br>minute II is very much for the<br>well-being of the collective or<br>community and you also see cultural<br>values like equality or the importance<br>of eye to eye communication which is<br>shared by both Maori and Pakeha we hope<br>everyone recognized this lady<br>gesina arden she's the prime minister of<br>New Zealand and also a lumini of the<br>University of Waikato as well so this<br>photo shows you she's cooking sausages<br>for the public community so even the<br>leader of this country's C equal quarter<br>values s ehre knows and if you've been<br>watching her new<br>we use you probably will find out she<br>always have the eye-to-eye communication<br>with the public so with this let's go<br>back to the quarter shock so to give it<br>a definition culture shock is an anxiety<br>and results from losing all your<br>familiar signs and symbols of social<br>interactions and there is some size of<br>you may notice that you get easily<br>stress or you may notice that you will<br>get angry or frustrated things you<br>wouldn't do normally you may be well you<br>may be unable to focus on your study<br>perhaps you stop attending class you may<br>find yourself sleeping quite a long UO<br>maybe your friends find out you are<br>you've something feel quite side and on<br>me and you start withdrawing from people<br>keeping to yourself and just staying at<br>home or maybe you are only taking with<br>people in or from your own country all<br>the time and trying to connect to those<br>things I wish which you are very<br>familiar such as language let's say when<br>culture shock moment happens<br>so before you arrived in New Zealand you<br>will have a up and down feeling<br>sometimes you feel a little bit nervous<br>you don't know what to prepare but the<br>other time you will be very exciting<br>because you are going to study in<br>overseas country another for the between<br>the first months and three months<br>everything is very new interesting and<br>exciting so he probably will have a real<br>positive feelings we call this period as<br>the honeymoon of your overseas studies<br>but from the third month<br>and to the six months so this is when<br>cortisol kicking so you will you will<br>realize some difference becoming tearing<br>and irritating and the some problems<br>occurred and you feel very frustrated<br>and you might feel homesickness as well<br>as you can see this is only for three<br>months of your whole overseas studies<br>period and from the six months you will<br>develop some strategy strategies to cope<br>start making some new friends<br>learn to adapt to the new zealand<br>culture so you can see your mood is<br>getting pretty stable and lastly you<br>started accepting and enjoying most of<br>the differences and you probably don't<br>even want to leave your new home and<br>your new friend as well so culture shock<br>is just one part of the cost reduction<br>so I would everyone here in the<br>university believe you will definitely<br>get through it so let's see what you can<br>do to feel better during the culture<br>shock period we have a lease of it very<br>good suggestion for you to feel better<br>take a screenshot if you want but what I<br>really want to say is use the English<br>you have and don't be hard on yourself<br>when you can't say or understand<br>everything<br>believe me this is same for every<br>overseas students coming in they will<br>have this exactly same feelings and some<br>news and culture will be wrong for you<br>but many things are just be different<br>please look for the good as well as bad<br>learn about news and cultures by<br>observing and asking questions<br>you would definitely like the New<br>Zealand portraits I believe and lastly I<br>just want to
