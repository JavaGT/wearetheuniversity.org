star<br>performer luke<br>here he uh you saw him in action<br>and yeah that's exactly right we're<br>looking forward to having you on campus<br>for those who can<br>so this the management student center<br>team are based in hamilton<br>so for those tolerance students um know<br>that we do<br>work with uh telling us services and<br>that's what i'll go through now<br>um so you can go to advisors there<br>in tarot campus you don't need to travel<br>over to hampton to speak to us<br>so they are your first point of contact<br>we'll go back so they are like msc but<br>they are more broader so they<br>offer all charting students advice so<br>they do your program planning<br>student id cards your um<br>what's having on tier shoes your partial<br>care<br>all the general information so msc<br>we offer direct stuff for management<br>students<br>but the student center is who you've<br>been working with for your initial<br>enrollment<br>that's where you get your student ids<br>so for the total student services you've<br>just got that one building<br>the student centre are located at the<br>hub<br>which is the main front counter as you<br>walk into that building<br>okay let's get started so you've<br>enrolled<br>you're in your papers what do you do<br>next<br>you need to get onto your timetable so<br>you have an understanding of when your<br>papers start next week so there are<br>different ways you can view your<br>timetable<br>uh ideally it's through moodle and<br>moodle i'll go through a bit<br>more later in case you're not aware of<br>that you can go<br>to my wakato to see your timetable<br>but also there's an online so if you<br>were to go onto the university website<br>and log on your student account you can<br>go to the 2020 online<br>timetable and that way it will show you<br>everything<br>so where if your class has a room number<br>allocated<br>that means it's going to be run face to<br>face with an<br>online option for those who need it if<br>your class says see<br>moodle this means that the material will<br>be available<br>in moodle itself there is no scheduled<br>time<br>to view the material and that material<br>should be made available prior to<br>scheduled in-person class time<br>the other thing is paper outline this is<br>your really important document<br>that it's everything you need to know<br>about your paper<br>it provides details on how your paper<br>will run over the course of the<br>trimester<br>it'll have the topics you'll cover the<br>readings that should be done<br>um assessments and when they will be due<br>and also all the staff contact details<br>for your lecturer<br>and when their office hours are so this<br>one<br>can be accessed via moodle so i'll go<br>through like i said mood a little bit<br>later this is a big question<br>a lot of confusion about i've heard my<br>classes are online<br>yes they if they need to be but<br>otherwise they can be face to face as<br>well<br>so it's a blended learning approach this<br>trimester<br>to be more flexible so the university is<br>adopting this<br>blended approach but are having many<br>opportunities for face-to-face teaching<br>and learning<br>as well as using technology to enhance<br>the learning experience for you<br>so guidelines will be provided by your<br>lecturer<br>on how you'll be asked to participate in<br>the paper and the assessments required<br>so that will be in the paper outline<br>ideally uh lecturers<br>may uh send it an email or notifications<br>so<br>it is your lecturer who's the main<br>resource to talk about each paper and<br>how<br>how they will individually be run so i<br>wanted to clarify<br>lectures will be online what we mean is<br>we're traditionally the lecturer would<br>stand in front of the classroom<br>and talk to students for an hour or two<br>hours mostly uninterrupted<br>and so not discussion in most cases<br>these will be replaced with a series of<br>short videos<br>that will prepare you for a more<br>in-depth discussion and that will be via<br>a workshop<br>tutorial or lab so i know the labels<br>have been confusing<br>but do follow the lecturer's individual<br>instructions<br>on how each paper will be running<br>if you're unable to attend on campus<br>we'll still provide an equivalent<br>experience online<br>so you should be able to indicate when<br>signing up for tutorials<br>and moodle whether you're going to join<br>face-to-face sessions<br>in person or remotely if in doubt though<br>do let your lecturer know what your<br>intentions are<br>i will go through shortly about the<br>different<br>paper occurrences and um yeah i'll<br>explain it later but<br>for net paper occurrence if you're<br>enrolled in net base i know there's a<br>few of you<br>master of digital business online those<br>papers are designed to be fully aligned<br>first off i'll go through moodle what is<br>it it is your personalised portal<br>and one stop website to manage your<br>studies at the university<br>that's our learning platform so it's<br>where all the information for your paper<br>will be available<br>but it's also where you'll sign up for<br>your tutorials and where you'll submit<br>your assignments<br>there's an opportunity for students to<br>engage with each other online<br>discussions<br>and as i said your lecturer may use<br>notifications<br>uh yes but that is the resource you'll<br>be using quite a bit<br>and where is it if you were to log on<br>to your student portal on the website uh<br>it is under the quick links or you can<br>actually get through<br>a useful link in moodle oh moodle sorry<br>my wife<br>too many m words okay so this is where i<br>was breaking down paper codes<br>um hopefully you're already aware of it<br>but i just want to recap to ensure you<br>do<br>so i've used an example of one of our<br>first year papers strategic management<br>101<br>so the stm the five<br>uh letters at start of a paper code is<br>the subject<br>101 is the level so 100<br>200 300 500 will be indicated here<br>20 is reference to 2020 and b is the<br>trimester<br>we have a b and c the occurrences<br>are hamilton tauranga or net<br>so when we're saying blended approach<br>it's your hamilton tauranga<br>for those who are going to come on<br>campus<br>where can you find your class so in your<br>timetable we'll have<br>where your lecture will be placed it<br>does make sense you think that your<br>lecture will be in management but it<br>might also be<br>in other buildings so we do have an<br>interactive campus map<br>if you're lost go on there on your phone<br>and it'll be able to give you<br>instructions<br>but to break it down i have on the<br>powerpoint here<br>it's just the first few letters is the<br>building<br>the next number it might be g for ground<br>or one for first floor<br>etc and then it's got the room number so<br>you'll need that as well if you're<br>oh i just meant to mention this right at<br>the start<br>i'm going to have a quiz at the end of<br>this with a prize<br>so i do hope you're taking note<br>okay so uni login every students<br>will have access uh email account<br>uh so a student at wikitor email account<br>um for you to use on campus there will<br>be free internet<br>using the wi-fi and lab computers<br>so there are computer labs i talk about<br>that where they're located<br>they all have facilities to print scan<br>and copy<br>but what's really good is h drive and i<br>don't think that's used<br>often enough it's really handy for<br>students who<br>are at home and you're trying to save<br>your work<br>and you want to come to uni to print it<br>h drive<br>is accessible via the website so your<br>student portal<br>under it services and so<br>yeah it's i highly recommend to use that<br>rather than relying on the usb which you<br>so there's a self-help guide i don't<br>know if<br>if anyone wants it luke can paste this<br>into the chat if you want to copy and<br>paste it yourselves<br>it's just an it self-help guide but if<br>you're<br>in the student center for example using<br>a lab you'll be able to just go to<br>student services<br>and they'll be able to help you with<br>that<br>or come to msc and we can try and help<br>unicash so i mentioned that we do have<br>facilities for you to be able to print<br>to do so you do need to have uh money in<br>a uni cash account<br>so you can do this in person in the<br>student center on level 2<br>to top up or online you can do<br>these are the facilities so full<br>management students<br>in our video you saw nec the labs for<br>students which are open 24 hours<br>uh the level just below so you can come<br>through msc reception head on downstairs<br>and they're there<br>and also the student center uh which<br>more students know it as the library<br>also has computer labs available for 24<br>hours<br>and i'll talk shortly about um how to<br>have access to those spaces<br>and i'm going to talk about toting a<br>spaces next as well food<br>because to me that's really important<br>needing to have those sweet<br>sweet treats to keep you going we do<br>have<br>uh some vending machines around the<br>place<br>and we have um a kitchenette for<br>students<br>so you'll be able to have a microwave to<br>heat up your meals and<br>hot water to make your drinks and we're<br>fortunate that we have a memento<br>on this side so there's cafes and then<br>center of the university we also have<br>one<br>just by us as well in<br>the video we indicated about some study<br>spaces<br>so there are some

on every level<br>building<br>and vending machines on the ground floor<br>level one<br>there's also a kitchen available for you<br>to use on the ground floor<br>where there is access to microwaves and<br>boiling water and<br>i'm not sure there was a cafe being<br>built hopefully that's all running now<br>for you<br>but as in being in the cbd you've got<br>i'm going to talk next about after hours<br>access<br>so student id card is not just your id<br>and it is a resource to have swipe<br>access into facilities<br>for hamilton students you need to have<br>that activated<br>i believe for toting a student so it<br>already is<br>um your student like id card pin<br>will have if not already been emailed to<br>your student<br>university email account<br>um yeah for totaling her<br>you've

that's<br>what msc is there for or the student hub<br>for totaling the students<br>come and see us give us a call and we<br>something else that's really important<br>and you may be in transition<br>of accommodation or contact details<br>so when you do change please remember to<br>keep us informed so we can contact you<br>if need be<br>you can do it through moodle i've given<br>the example there but you can also do it<br>so this is the other side this is the<br>general support side<br>student learning are amazing they've got<br>great tools they've got<br>all this information during coven about<br>how to study online for example<br>they're not just there for technical<br>academic support you've got issue with<br>the paper but it's you know<br>your grammar punctuation<br>how to do a presentation um<br>what's really important for management<br>students is to know apa referencing<br>that is our tool that you'll need to<br>know<br>really well so you can book face-to-face<br>consultations with them they're running<br>workshops<br>they're available via zoom um yeah so<br>you can get in touch with them<br>if you'd like we could send you a link<br>or we could share a page in the q a if<br>you'd like to see what they look like<br>another thing that's available for<br>online tutoring is studiosity<br>this is a free service for students<br>and there's two different ways to do it<br>so you can um<br>submit some written piece of work to get<br>information so<br>they're not your tutors that will be<br>able to talk specific about<br>an assignment they're there for general<br>information<br>and they're not to give you answers and<br>to help help you along<br>so it's um it's via moodle<br>and once you've gone through there you<br>can actually download it as an app<br>so it's a link in your each paper<br>it should be under like a resource<br>section and that's where you'll be able<br>you know stuff happens i mean a lot went<br>on in a trimester<br>so there are times you may be impaired<br>for your assessment<br>and we don't want you to just try and<br>you know grit your teeth and try and get<br>through it we do want you to come<br>approach us<br>and see what we can do to help you if<br>there could be an extension or<br>yeah so yes there is special<br>consideration available for students<br>you know due to circumstances beyond<br>your control you're impaired for it<br>um how do you go about this is for the<br>internal assessment<br>you apply via the department so in<br>moodle<br>under the resources there will be forms<br>for you to fill out<br>that will explain your circumstances and<br>also you'll need to<br>supply any documentation you may have um<br>any questions so again let me see we can<br>help you through<br>through them nearly there guys nearly<br>there<br>it's a plagiarism it's a fun topic this<br>one<br>um but really important one so<br>when you're submitting your assessments<br>through moodle it goes through a program<br>called turnitin<br>and it will pick up where um<br>this is where apa referencing is really<br>important and something's not referenced<br>properly it may be picked up<br>as plagiarized so you can use other<br>people's ideas to support your work<br>in research but you must acknowledge<br>those ideas<br>and where we're having tests that are<br>online if you're<br>doing work with your friend and you have<br>the exact same answers as each other<br>that will be picked up and you will be<br>questioned about it<br>so please do take note about<br>it there's plenty of resources for apa<br>punctuation<br>i mentioned about student learning but<br>even the library has<br>a document um that actually outlines it<br>all<br>so um they actually do workshops as well<br>so it's not just student learning<br>the fun side so student clubs they um<br>there's over 100 affiliated clubs with<br>campus<br>through the student union we in<br>management

jackson get that too i can send the<br>link<br>but yeah there is um how do we know<br>which lab classes we will be allocated<br>to<br>so depending on the paper there may be<br>so for first year for example there may<br>be more offerings because there's more<br>people enrolled in the paper<br>so in the timetable for example the<br>online<br>through the web page there may be<br>multiple options<br>and it might show as a workshop as<br>opposed to tutorial<br>or lab so<br>it's through the lecturer and moodle<br>will give you those options of where you<br>can select<br>this is where you don't want each papers<br>to overlap<br>so you should have a selection of choice<br>there may be less<br>options for those a higher level if<br>there's less enrollments<br>so these students in it i hope that<br>helps but yeah moodle is your tool and<br>your lecture you'll be able to explain<br>what there is on offer and you should<br>have the opportunity to sign up for it<br>you won't have well

not sure if this will be each<br>lecturer may do it differently<br>uh their creative license so they may<br>email you in advance<br>and so you'd know what session to go to<br>initially to<br>have a chat to them but it might be all<br>is there a central platform to purchase<br>there is a place on campus that you can<br>purchase textbooks<br>is this hamilton based<br>as opposed to tauranga um<br>they they used to be called bennett's<br>but they've changed i think they're<br>campus<br>books yeah so<br>i don't know on the website we can<br>follow that up for you if you like<br>um if they have it online they<br>definitely were operating for example<br>um at the start of the year they're open<br>now and working so you can go see them<br>in person<br>so they're in the student
