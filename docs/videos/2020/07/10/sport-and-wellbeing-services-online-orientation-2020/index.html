delighted to have<br>you joining us here today and we're<br>going to run you through some of the<br>opportunities that we offer for our<br>students<br>um so pay attention and you might find<br>something that you're really excited<br>about we hope so<br>um so cool<br>we're going to cover ways to be fit and<br>well at the university of waikato so<br>it's kind of like a speed dating version<br>of what we do and if you have any<br>questions<br>just pop them in the chat and we'll try<br>and answer them afterwards<br>oh and welcome cool<br>okay we're going to start off with<br>esports um so not sure if you're aware<br>but we have a brand new esports facility<br>on campus<br>um it's really exciting it's located up<br>at the station<br>and it's 15 per year to sign up<br>and we've also got a university uh<br>challenge happening at the moment and<br>it's an esport challenge and so if you<br>want to become a national champion<br>at the fifa competition and you can<br>register now um<br>more details on that will come later um<br>but anything you want gaming wise uh<br>we've got it<br>yeah okay so you can sign up for the<br>club for 15<br>a year and you sign up at the arena<br>which is<br>in the building the station oh oh and<br>volunteers want it<br>um so if you sign up through epp then or<br>you can just come to the arena and find<br>out how you can be<br>extra more involved cool<br>so the other space and it's in the same<br>building as the esport arena<br>is the well-being hub you can see kind<br>of what we get up to there that's my<br>role is to coordinate this space<br>um it's a place like a home away from<br>home on campus<br>so if you're looking for a place to take<br>a cheeky nap<br>or read a book or do some mindful<br>coloring we've got board games as you<br>can see some people<br>playing scrabble there we've got an<br>outside area<br>although probably not so ideal in winter<br>or you can just come and have a yarn or<br>even do some study while you're there<br>it's i think it's one of the cozier<br>coziest spots on campus<br>and we have our student well-being<br>ambassadors if you have any<br>questions around well-being you can<br>always check to them or we can find out<br>where on campus you can get extra<br>support<br>and part of what we do is we run<br>some workshops so we're lucky enough to<br>have eco<br>campus which is our sustainability group<br>they come and do<br>bi-weekly workshops you can make your<br>own beeswax wrap or<br>um you can create your own shopping bag<br>all kinds of things like that so we love<br>having them and if you want to get<br>involved with that<br>then all this information is on facebook<br>and instagram and we let you know every<br>monday what's on for that week<br>um other things that we have going on is<br>we've got micro volunteering that come<br>in<br>so if you want to do something good for<br>the world the other ones to check in<br>with<br>um we also have bullet
