you like a seat - here see me<br>talking over here in Hamilton<br>we all say a heavy our team over and<br>introduce themselves see see our<br>know and just any party we also have the<br>check function going so if you guys see<br>won't ask any questions throughout you<br>can write us a question and we'll be<br>able to answer you straight away<br>hopefully so cool I'm on fire I'm so<br>calm even we talk we go who'd eat any<br>more not pointing out the FATA I am a<br>coma he and the DBC mo do for<br>specificity Vice Chancellor mone I work<br>on the front student engagement of weeks<br>orientation and also part of the Alumni<br>chemo program as well so go the swing<br>some way and only else to do some<br>selfies I'm going to tell them I'm gonna<br>send I put the credit Sorensen Topanga<br>if anything they know Madeline I am a<br>fifth year student studying my masters<br>I'm the screen media studies but I'm<br>also kind money I work in the division<br>of that Social Sciences Lowell Social<br>Sciences in psychology under the<br>division of society in psychology and<br>years in psychology and was a big<br>Italian as well as Jamie sunbae<br>I wouldn't say we've got students here<br>from Hamilton NSA if you are from either<br>campus I mean you give any pathway then<br>you can defy them way different students<br>from different faculties and schools say<br>is everything come hopefully we're just<br>going to go through slide and we're<br>gonna pretty much the students to speak<br>so the slides yeah we're going through<br>so our first slide myth number one<br>school is exactly the same as University<br>it's not the same in the timetable<br>structure so when you come to uni your<br>lectures are little blocks throughout<br>the week and you as you all know school<br>is four days every day of the week so<br>university is really different in that<br>way and with that flexible timetable you<br>can choose what you want to study at<br>university so it's not like school with<br>those subjects that you have to do even<br>if you don't want to hear it unique and<br>choose your papers what ones interests<br>you what subjects interest you even if<br>you're doing a degree that has lots of<br>necessary papers you can still do<br>electives to get your interests in and<br>anything else do you think you see any<br>of our other students having a TV job<br>prior to obviously COBIT most of your<br>teachers whatever looks like this but<br>however you still have tutorials<br>workshops or lips which are be sorry II<br>added me um so you still have workshops<br>tutorials and labs which are quite<br>smaller like 20 people mix we can get<br>that one-on-one interaction with the<br>lecturers I'm your tutors and I'm your<br>peers but because of covert the<br>university is taking a blended approach<br>where some of your all of your classes<br>will be offered online but some classes<br>you can go to in prison particularly for<br>the classes that are like this they<br>won't be offered in person just that<br>mainly because the university wants to<br>keep classes the same throughout the<br>semester so if we do go to a higher<br>alert nipple yeah able to social<br>distance in our class so yeah classes<br>like this you probably wouldn't be able<br>to social distance in them so it will be<br>none of those none of those yes and for<br>the most part there's only a few<br>people's for the massive classes like<br>that so most of the classes are still<br>often in prison I know there's a lot of<br>rumors going around yeah<br>there's no classes on person so just be<br>aware that there are gonna be face<br>they're still in place yeah just chicken<br>make sure it's you know little pages and<br>yeah each classroom aside to I think a<br>lot of the lectures have already been<br>online so toning the students are<br>actually used to having that model in<br>place certain programs the lectures have<br>always been online<br>with the tutorials and labs offered on<br>campus so just following that up for F<br>is anyone listening who's gonna or heads<br>roll to come to telling me it is not a<br>single class that's going to look like<br>that<br>even if covert head in heaven I'm a<br>super maybe teaching first year teaching<br>in the on-site one by majority the<br>it's very this one example is actually<br>implements of our opportunity within my<br>consoles in your classes tutorials labs<br>outside or university academic stuff in<br>terms of like the moldy dog who they can<br>join heaps of group seems to stuff<br>always heavy on campuses they you'll<br>find you just have too many people<br>you'll be walking around like you're a<br>superstar hey kill the Kilda throwing<br>them out like you're grunts everybody<br>but yeah don't worry about not making<br>friends because it's actually the one<br>problem is a year to me and you have to<br>bust a mess Nathan summed up perfectly<br>myth number four on screen of something<br>pups<br>I'll speak to this one at the start side<br>I think the main thing with the sliders<br>that we have species with our Marty<br>students as you all know we've got so<br>many things that pop up outside of<br>University unexpectedly plenty hunger<br>buffering paper that may pop up where we<br>lead it to go back home I think the most<br>important thing to know is that there<br>are ways to select our lecturers and no<br>other staff places that we don't fail or<br>fall behind the Deenie of your papers as<br>it is if you fall in the creek devonee's<br>we can make sure that us are students in<br>thank you left behind there won't be any<br>marks there's such things as special<br>consideration of something major does<br>pop up but the most important thing is<br>that you do leave your difference<br>pathway or keep in touch with your<br>lecturers then it can be a lot more<br>lenient around your different<br>assignments your different papers but I<br>think the most important thing is they<br>don't tell anyone should also let you<br>you know can see when the bus and we can<br>actually help you go towards the right<br>person that you're in charge and yeah<br>don't not seek help and because we're<br>all here to help<br>Beatrice they actually want you guys to<br>and succeed they also want you guys to<br>pass and so don't feel don't feel like<br>you can't not ask for help<br>yeah yeah Kilda that's a good point too<br>insane just touching on that again as<br>there throughout our whole university<br>turning in 1/7 we have a multi mentoring<br>unit in each division faculty or school<br>so Athena is mental model coordinator<br>interning at Decatur is looking after<br>our social science psychology art<br>students and we have one on teaching<br>management if MMus all over so in each<br>meter unit is the from student mentors<br>like you're telling a penalty and sub<br>honors student mentor to so you're<br>reaching out to those monument or units<br>they are a huge help and helping you<br>with anything pretty much if we we're<br>doing a limb crystal orientation we<br>usually whatever you guys speak<br>different mental coordinators but<br>hopefully we can sits on the MRC so I<br>can't have a life outside of the<br>university I've seen the social aspect<br>of this my main philosophy is do the<br>money get the treat so always make sure<br>you expand so that you can enjoy your<br>weekend however you want to hang out<br>free concerts yeah so that's my you<br>can't name a life just always prioritize<br>or work and just get it fancy catch<br>something yeah touch on their as they<br>will say this talking earlier about it<br>being it's not like school where you<br>don't have to come to uni Michael three<br>so you might only have one class one day<br>so as long as you go in there one class<br>get the handle amount of time to do<br>other stuff and I know he was the money<br>people we have you're like juggling all<br>these other copepod trying to go do what<br>I do and all of these different events<br>and there is plenty of time to do that<br>as long as you're putting a fine quality<br>time for your study as well there yeah<br>you can't even like that silent<br>university yeah and I'm gonna throw bay<br>under the bus to that high school was<br>just date done then you got home and<br>play some sports and do some stuff and<br>randomly throughout the day so now you<br>have a time management and that's<br>probably that's probably the key thing<br>coming to a university I think was my<br>biggest thing to learn speaking with<br>school because I had to still do well<br>but they don't want to get good grades<br>as well the sign some autographs on<br>Pinterest<br>I definitely time management is key and<br>again I'll reiterate monetary units<br>appear to if they need help us going<br>through timetables time management our<br>team can help you make up a plan so that<br>you don't fall behind and get so might<br>be talking about the morning between<br>units I think me at the moment here I<br>could get strong<br>eight or nine definitely ate all my<br>across the two campuses and so just will<br>go through different that's for my team<br>it's Regan's so almighty mentors speak<br>Maori it's a big misconception we yeah<br>we have our monumental core days employ<br>different students are doing well<br>papers or their studies so that they<br>know that we through the peoples there I<br>have able to help you company you need<br>help but just because that as a Marty<br>mentoring unit that does not mean that<br>you have to be fluent and unable to go<br>and get help and as well I'm gonna spray<br>this one up I'm not sure I'm not getting<br>this opportunity like I wasn't going to<br>throw it away and then it's the same for<br>using your resources like if you've got<br>the opportunity to use it to use them in<br>towards you may as well do it<br>there's no saying what you can can't do<br>just because we think you're not quite<br>naughty enough it's just so we we don't<br>work and percentages here I with it as<br>well that doesn't only apply to the<br>Marty mentors it applies to any Marty of<br>these you don't have to be<br>specific amount of Maori or think that<br>your you have to be fluent or have got<br>to cook up or anything like that<br>like turn up we want you there if you<br>want to be there even if you don't want<br>to be there Turner so yes and even<br>though we've got a good job well one of<br>it also probably didn't come it doesn't<br>mean if you've got everything covered I<br>bring only failing students use the<br>mentals yep so we get a lot of students<br>who come in who want to make their say a<br>- into an A+ I think majority of our<br>students actually come in look for how<br>to raise their grade but in saying that<br>we get all types of students so yeah<br>it's not just for failure students we<br>help any students just to help them get<br>that bitter grade probably comes before<br>you fail don't think you can only go if<br>you're doing badly go if you want to<br>raise your grading get a little bit<br>better percentage yeah and I think there<br>could be even if you're submitting your<br>assignments you keep getting pulled up<br>on the same thing I think just having<br>that extra set of eyes from your my<br>mentors who have probably done the<br>papers to read over and say oh I noticed<br>if you keep saying this in your writing<br>then I can just be still green up just a<br>little bit and even their decoding at<br>the moment in their mentoring unit<br>they're running a shortly they'll be<br>running a show us you're a great so if<br>you go in and show them you've got an a<br>you know I'm sure that you got to think<br>things through but it's different<br>different benefits and very well and get<br>sponsors or anyone history and also a<br>monetary units also run a couple Sequoia<br>he they may run the social events - so<br>workshops year so if you are keen to get<br>involved other students specifically in<br>your faculty - yeah that's a good place<br>to go to so I was going to treat it like<br>a job so you like comes uni every single<br>day but what treating like the job will<br>good luck for you that's two hours every<br>day Monday to Friday we just eat and<br>you'll find that you can just do so much<br>money and two hours if you just see two<br>hours everyday I think I want us to join<br>the Moldy associations and the mone<br>Norbu that way you're going to find and<br>meet all of these cool people around<br>you're doing cool stuff you know make<br>heaps of friends easy you're going to<br>find that they're gonna help you I will<br>fill your assignments and if you even<br>need to talk to mentors or find<br>different information about uni you've<br>got fifty to a hundred people they<br>already know how to do they just let me<br>such a one my survival tip is just to<br>make use of every opportunity that you<br>can get join you know the leadership<br>program money leadership program if you<br>can join the first year programs we can<br>tackle infinity and yeah join the little<br>fairies turtle or look seed and you know<br>just look for fraternities and don't be<br>shy the tapered soup obviously those are<br>great survival tips and you're taking<br>all my good ones so I'm gonna say please<br>just go to your tutorial<br>workshops at your labs and a law degree<br>class most of our exam questions come<br>very similar to what our tutorial<br>missions are so it's actually really<br>handy to go to those and say how do i so<br>then it's for an example like in my<br>classes and they were busting out the<br>essay line with one day to go and I<br>already finished my we don't but you<br>guys are just putting so much pressure<br>intensity make it so much easier for<br>yourself we think for everyone but<br>specifically toward students because we<br>have such a small<br>students over here I think it's like<br>really like they to make friends with in<br>your classes and keep those networks<br>open at all times and we only have like<br>for example in our Lord classes over<br>here we've got maximum 25 to 30 people<br>and so we can welcome you from each<br>other and if you lose their<br>communication you kind of lose your way<br>of finding out how others are doing in<br>like hell you can ask for help so that's<br>been a huge one so my tip would be to<br>keep those relationships at all times I<br>think that if it's up to I think just<br>sort of reaching out to the resources on<br>campus like there's amazing resources we<br>talked about Paul who's amazing in our<br>writing support space and then we have<br>Alana Johnson who's our campus nurse and<br>she can like put you in contact with<br>with anything else related and then to<br>talk of course our demony Mentors I<br>think just reaching out and there's a<br>lot of supports here on campus from all<br>new students and so I think it's just<br>having that having sort of the<br>confidence to just come and say hey and<br>have a chat and then there's just ya<br>loss too lots to access to help you<br>support all of the study aspects of your<br>university journey so I think just that<br>reaching out and just look at all the<br>resources that are available to you yes<br>totally to pull all of those boots yeah<br>I always sort of say excuse me it's hard<br>to fail at the University prepares so<br>much support out there with literally<br>everything say your academic help your<br>emotional health your spiritual physical<br>health but yet in this year there's so<br>many different people out there to<br>support my students say if you want to<br>go for scholarships or not help with<br>your career advice anything that's all<br>out there um my survival tip would be to<br>this so much free food always on campus<br>just OBS he always puts on three cows<br>Hamilton see FPC freestream go fruit<br>don't be shy that's will be here thank<br>you again we'll go down if you can also<br>your favorite part about unity again for<br>ease of the spotter into them because we<br>can see when you think of me reason do<br>you need or your favorite any of the<br>leadership groups that I I say my<br>biggest highlight with me last year we<br>went to week-long hiding and we learned<br>so much so I think just join those<br>groups as if I keep saying and you<br>I have no idea what I was really going<br>into and I first applied for my role in<br>my papers now I know a whole bunch of<br>stuff to do with the earth and stuff are<br>no idea what that would have been in<br>high school hens are such an awesome<br>experience and I think just joining<br>things you know so many opportunities<br>that I got out of their heads actually<br>further just my own growth and also job<br>opportunities so just you know the<br>difference between school and university<br>I was crammed at school because there<br>wasn't anything here that I really<br>enjoyed but the beauty of university my<br>favorite part certainly was that you can<br>actually fall in what you want to do you<br>can start in forging a path for the<br>direction that you want your life to<br>take and you know that's been it's been<br>wonderful for me it's better than laying<br>bricks and fixing given all that kind of<br>crap that was living before him so<br>that's there's also choosing what you<br>want oh and really applying yourself to<br>a pension my favorite part of uni has<br>probably been finding really good<br>friends like in my first semester of uni<br>I really struggled to find like friends<br>that I really connected with in these I<br>joined to here for the mighty<br>law Association and just finding those<br>like-minded people who I really get<br>along with in connect with it and over<br>there's building friendships with other<br>people through other things and yeah<br>just finding those people who you really<br>connect with and you have the same<br>tomorrow's and ideas and the same ideas<br>about life really there's been my<br>yeah my favorite part of uni was<br>actually graduating so I graduated in<br>2018 for my undergraduate these two<br>fellows but yeah I think I was a mess of<br>thing for me cuz I got to graduate with<br>two of my best friends just follow and<br>another guy amazing experience I made<br>malaya graduation if you don't think if<br>you're not getting close to graduating<br>it's definitely experience and just<br>having your father there with you yeah<br>it's hard not to cry opportunities for<br>me that's a limitless said University of<br>yeah all great memories all great things<br>and we'll touch on a few more those so<br>yeah I'll rock your body<br>we've already something about pinless<br>already sort of talked about them so<br>stem and our science endearing met<br>critics took not typically in education<br>in sports to wioa is for everyone to<br>coyote which is our newest story which<br>link is a prison home they are for our<br>faculty in the in the duma study<br>students enter to me or opportunity they<br>are for environmental and geographies<br>students and sorry Donna also here's a<br>little trouble afoot Menaka keep it as<br>anyone a part of their own gravity as<br>far as I know they're rebuilding at the<br>moment<br>I<br>yeah so we are gonna try to look at ways<br>to support manake sort of coming back I<br>think just in the last couple years and<br>since the campus has been Bill Anunnaki<br>is here but it sort of been a smaller<br>group that's China for my programming<br>and you know opportunities to come<br>together but as far as I know it's it's<br>rebuilding this year so yeah so most of<br>our oakley they all have social media<br>pages but all about hope you will<br>usually check on Kai they chuckle<br>different social events different things<br>during cultural hours on Wednesdays yeah<br>there's so many opportunities without<br>Opie to get involved and it's such a<br>good way to make friends which is what<br>we've seen at the start because there's<br>so many students who are studying the<br>same thing as you and so it's easy to<br>sort of unique over your different<br>assignments you're from my here and be<br>like hey I need help with us I know<br>you're doing it and then just get<br>connect their way but yeah and it's also<br>just a way to just sort of relax outside<br>of your study to it just come together<br>for a while whatever it may be<br>yeah their balance is key I believe your<br>no motive student programs so some of<br>these have already been touched on so<br>these are run out about deputy<br>vice-chancellor body office so TK Lupita<br>D which is pretty new so I don't wanna<br>and day me out so I'm gonna on the<br>program the see so they may want to jump<br>in at some point soon but essentially<br>Takagi PDT is for our first Imani<br>students who have just come to<br>university and it's sort of a transition<br>program so if anything it heats a mobile<br>go in your first year and then takobi<br>bit it is to sort of help you transition<br>to university and give you all the needs<br>of those to sit you up on the right key<br>but you want anything and then a lot of<br>us so that's one of the cohorts I think<br>neither good or evil to me<br>program run for sick India my sins and<br>above so you can join the program you<br>come from all walks of life all<br>different faculties and schools and form<br>this place in a group of placing a group<br>of fun every pretty much but you go<br>different cope up a different hiding me<br>usually and just then the program<br>doesn't teach you how to be a leader but<br>rather will show you mighty leaders in<br>the different fields and you can take<br>from Italy to what you wanted to build<br>your own sort of leadership profile by<br>an amazing opportunity so definitely<br>look out for it<br>um I know it has changed up a little bit<br>the stage the streets are covert but I<br>mean it's still a great opportunity and<br>in the following up to whom innocuous so<br>let's also run out of our office between<br>me and a horse maybe put medley so there<br>is for our it's open for Modi business<br>students from any to Sri provider but in<br>saying it I would encourage you want to<br>just read the criteria and anybody's<br>students apply also if your Modi's small<br>business so there's three Freitas areas<br>which are three focus locations expose<br>in the Pacific Southeast Asia North Asia<br>and Latin America currently the<br>Southeast Asia and the North Asia<br>programs are open publications was kind<br>of inhibiting the sea there isn't there<br>travel international travel is speak<br>telling that's be redesigned it's still<br>going to be an awesome program to engage<br>with people overseas and come together<br>in the country just get loan from<br>another four speakers so jump onto our<br>social media dumped onto all those are<br>for Peters check them out we definitely<br>encourage you to apply and main<br>opportunities limitless opportunities<br>nonetheless so again we have so many<br>different events on campus both campuses<br>say we have no high connect you know<br>just a sports pay for the promote off<br>all of Maori students across the<br>faculties graduation the mono my<br>graduation is Tennessee that's awesome<br>it's a chance to bring all your phony<br>where as a clue of ins you can take like<br>one or two people so yeah it you can<br>take your whole line eggs are they<br>ordering orange<br>you today that's coming up in September<br>it's a big event just to celebrate can<br>you swing up we've got different kind<br>for he we have so many different
