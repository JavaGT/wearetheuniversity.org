something don't you<br>think like what something to create a<br>little bit of suspense before we<br>announce our winners hmm like a drumroll<br>yes exactly something like this all<br>right I think me and my friends have you<br>about you Kevin<br>play the drum roll all right and now for<br>the first over 19 commercial prize this<br>let's hear their pitch creating rosters<br>for shift workers and hospitals is hard<br>for a medium-sized nurse ward creating a<br>roster over a month there are more<br>combinations of assigning shifts to each<br>employee then there are stars in the<br>entire nolan galaxy and when you have to<br>consider contractual obligations legal<br>obligations patient demands staff<br>satisfaction staff skills as well as<br>coronavirus misc bubbles and many other<br>factors there could just be a single<br>perfect roster fortunately we have<br>developed an artificial intelligence<br>based optimizing algorithm for finding<br>that single perfect roster and a vast<br>number of different rostering problems<br>in fact global benchmarks show that our<br>staff roster in algorithm is the best in<br>the entire world<br>our goal is to create rosters for<br>hospitals all over Australia saving<br>millions of dollars and salaries as well<br>as drastically improving patient<br>outcomes thank you very much<br>congratulations roster that what the<br>string can be a nightmare for emergency<br>institutions so it's a great idea to use<br>AI to solve the problem and now the Cova<br>19 social category prize winner is<br>congratulations team let's hear the<br>pitch and a cocktail cocktail I my name<br>is Noah Romero and I'm here representing<br>circle a circle out is a digital<br>learning platform that allows young<br>people to learn from one another in a<br>safe and supportive environment we draw<br>from indigenous knowledge system that<br>practices to unify community technology<br>and education under the belief that life<br>and learning are one<br>say sir cloud is a place where children<br>can both share their learning and find<br>educational content created by other<br>children have played an integral role in<br>the fight against cope at 19 as<br>demonstrated by child play's mutual aid<br>efforts in public safety campaign<br>education systems however are committed<br>to adult centered learning models and<br>have struggled to adapt to the pandemic<br>which has led to widespread student<br>disengagement studies show that children<br>enjoy learning from one another and that<br>learning becomes more meaningful when<br>young people to see themselves reflected<br>in the learning content current<br>educational landscape therefore suggests<br>the need to reimagine education so that<br>it is more inclusive equitable and child<br>centered well what an amazing idea to<br>unite altero as youth and now we will be<br>moving on to the commercial and social<br>crisis for this evening in no particular<br>congratulations team let's hear their<br>pitch we also do laundry each week the<br>process is quick and easy<br>what we don't know is that each wash<br>cycle ends of thousands of microfibers<br>being washed into the ocean entering our<br>water supplies and moving up the food<br>chain technically we're eating our<br>clothes for dinner<br>in fact we ingest almost 6,000 synthetic<br>particles each week that's the same as<br>eating your credit card each week that<br>is a health risk due to the possibility<br>of ingesting heavy metals and toxic<br>chemicals we are purify bur and we aim<br>to reduce unconscious waste in everyday<br>life to help people become more<br>sustainable this recycled rubber ball<br>will be thrown into the washing machine<br>alongside your clothes what it can into<br>and leave but the filter is too fine for<br>the microfibers trapping them in the<br>pool 30 fiber is convenient and<br>affordable so it is a great option for<br>curious to take a stand against<br>microplastics purify bur is the Dyson<br>for micro fibers in your laundry we hope<br>that our solution will stop us all from<br>eating our own clothes<br>Wow purified ago that's an awesome<br>concept I would definitely purchase your<br>products are winning credit cards worth<br>of plastic every week and now the next<br>Prize winner is about their idea once we<br>are fortunate enough to enjoy bountiful<br>and will decline seashores with a<br>delicate balance struck between<br>maintaining sustainable fishing<br>industries while allowing every Kiwi to<br>enjoy their favorite claim owner while<br>there are clear guidelines to ensure a<br>sustainable marine life the tools policy<br>and quota management uses mostly<br>inefficient manual measurement processes<br>we propose first box as a modern<br>solution leveraging the latest in AI and<br>imagery technology is an efficient<br>automated management of this precious<br>resource we have identified our primary<br>customers as commercial fisheries and<br>recreational fishermen which contributed<br>up to 10 billion dollars to the New<br>Zealand economy in 2019 with no current<br>competition offering a similar system<br>and considering a 10% market penetration<br>we estimate our initial revenue to be<br>close to nine million dollars in New<br>Zealand only remember it is all about<br>ensuring a bright sustainable future of<br>our sea shores for hours and generations<br>beyond well thanks for sharing your idea<br>of what a great sustainable solution<br>loving all your ideas tonight now no<br>particular order we'll move on with our<br>congratulations G vintage let's hear<br>your pitch Puran I'm Tony Hickey now<br>take a deep breath and clearly<br>adrenaline from your system but don't<br>breathe too deep because just around the<br>corner could be this beastie covert 19<br>and if you do get covered 19 you might<br>end up on a ventilator problem is<br>there's not many of these ventilators<br>and if you're on a ventilator too long<br>you might end up with lungs like this<br>but don't worry the curve has been<br>squashed but a hex that came back which<br>was all too easy put into perspective we<br>could have had three thousand deaths and<br>even further we've got very few beds in<br>ICU units and the specialized busy<br>required for ventilators so we need to<br>get inventing and people have they've<br>come up with things like small course<br>there's split ventilators to get two to<br>four people on them and people have<br>gotten to their garage and use bits and<br>bobs and texts and things to make themes<br>latest but these systems are quite<br>dangerous because they let the furnace<br>for a single person so our idea is to<br>come up with a different way of<br>delivering oxygen to people this is a<br>cheap deliverable system and it will<br>likely save lives thank you very much<br>for your time great idea Jeevan doxed<br>ventilators are extremely important when<br>facing situations like kovin 19:00<br>having novel ventilators which are more<br>efficient is the difference that can<br>save lives and now the next prize goes<br>to cure the drumroll and the winner is<br>mika robotics

define who gets to put food<br>on the table cheaper all inclusive<br>travel deals siphon money from<br>developing countries if the NGO will<br>facilitate extra income to local<br>families through the redirection of<br>ethical travelers if the NGO has a<br>three-step process first we sourced<br>eco-friendly accommodation providers who<br>meets the ethical certification they<br>must be clearly owned and operated and<br>use sustainable practices second we fund<br>community led projects to improve<br>infrastructure no one likes a leaky tap<br>and thirdly we redirect ethical<br>travelers to these producers through our<br>user-friendly and educational website<br>ethical tourism isn't new it's merely<br>the overseas expansion of your usual<br>ethical choices if they go the right way<br>to

our<br>good<br>congratulations bacon let's hear all<br>about their idea we're on level two<br>right now and this lockdown has been one<br>of the hardest things I've ever done I<br>like going outside and having a great<br>time and I'm sure you do too but all<br>I've done is stayed in this room and<br>procrastinated so staying at home all<br>day might have caused you to feel bored<br>lonely maybe and for some of us even<br>slightly depressed so where do we go<br>during these times some call our friends<br>talk to our parents but what if it's<br>more complicated than that<br>what if I find it hard to share the<br>troubles because of the judgment on my<br>face seventy-nine thousand young people<br>like you and me are experiencing some<br>kind of psychological stress and said<br>every year and that's why we create a<br>beacon a social enterprise looking to<br>develop an accessible and mobile<br>platform for early intervention of young<br>arrows through matchmaking resources and<br>analytics that's us but doesn't just<br>have to beat us if you do someone who<br>might be having a bad time maybe you<br>sliding into the DMS could be the best<br>thing that happened to them
