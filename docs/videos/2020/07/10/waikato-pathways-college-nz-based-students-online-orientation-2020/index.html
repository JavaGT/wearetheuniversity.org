stories do for<br>us<br>why do we keep engaging with them why do<br>we telling them whether they are made-up<br>stories like you might see on TV or in<br>the movies or so-called true stories<br>about history in the social science<br>paper on the other hand we look at<br>humans and the way that groups of people<br>behave why do they behave that way<br>how do we change people's behavior if we<br>can why is it that each group thinks<br>that their way of doing things is the<br>right way it tends to look out on the<br>way that other groups do things these<br>are some of the things that we'll be<br>talking about in the social sciences<br>paper so if you're enrolled in one or<br>either of those two papers you'll be<br>seeing a lot of me over the semester and<br>I look forward to engaging

statistics and paging<br>heartless reading maths is for students<br>who do not have a strong background in<br>mess while bridging calculus is those<br>who wear a face from background medics I<br>had a paper who I allow you to do that<br>medical fact the best level that is<br>incapacity in the first two weeks we<br>have a chance to change from one paper<br>to the other if you find it odd easy I<br>will support you throughout this process<br>hello everyone my name is Geraldine<br>green-ass and I teach English to<br>international students and I just want<br>to tell you a little bit about the<br>courses so there are two courses there's<br>English one and there's English two and<br>both courses aimed to help you develop<br>your reading strategies build up your<br>academic vocabulary pray and practice<br>paraphrasing and essay writing we also<br>do a lot of practice in oral<br>communication and you get the chance to<br>design and deliver to oral presentations<br>I hope these skills will give you the<br>foundation that you need to complete<br>your foundation studies and your next<br>step when you start your degree course<br>so I wish you all the best and I hope to<br>see you on campus soon bye I would now<br>like to a dr. roxy is going to teach<br>it's gonna share a little bit about in<br>online so this woman's told us trimester<br>you'll be taught by being difficult and<br>if you're new to blended learning it's<br>basically a concept that involves a<br>combination of online and face-to-face<br>teaching so for this time instead<br>lectures will be recorded and available<br>on Moodle your tutorials and labs will<br>be face to face but if there is a reason<br>that you cannot attend face to face<br>please do let us know into this and most<br>of your assessments will be online so to<br>ensure that you're successful in your<br>blended online journey there are a few<br>things that you need to pay attention to<br>these to be successful and you go<br>through your courses so the first one is<br>your paper outlines and it's really<br>important that you read those they are<br>meant to use throughout each of your<br>courses and they detail a lot of<br>information about what your course<br>involves managing your time time<br>management involves being on time for<br>scheduled class<br>activities managing multiple assessments<br>within a similar timeframe and allowing<br>plenty of time to ask questions and<br>receive answers before a piece of<br>worthless to but in order to manage of<br>time properly you need to minimize<br>distractions so lots of students can<br>identify things that prevent them from<br>concentrating or participating in their<br>studies so we encourage you to try and<br>remove these for example closing the<br>irrelevant tabs on your computer leave<br>your phone and another room or turn it<br>off or tell your family and friends that<br>you're unavailable for the next few<br>hours while you concentrate on your<br>studies in a blended learning<br>environment it's also really important<br>to connect with your classmates get to<br>know each other ask each other for help<br>create study groups or develop social<br>time you can have either either<br>face-to-face or virtually but just know<br>that it's important that you contact<br>each other ask questions again it's<br>important that you ask questions when<br>you require help or need further<br>explanation utilize your face-to-face<br>tutorials and workshops but also online<br>tools such as zoom chat function Moodle<br>messaging or Moodle forms and lastly<br>take breaks it can be difficult to spend<br>a lot of time in front of screens and<br>learn concentrate on subject will be<br>present in a tutorial it's really<br>important that you take breaks and look<br>another thing that's really important is<br>to check that you have the required<br>technology at home so to be successful<br>you need to ensure that you have some if<br>not all of the following so a laptop<br>tablet or desktop if you have in live<br>sessions for your classes and you're<br>using a laptop or tablet make sure that<br>you have your child in heading if your<br>letter if you're using event for the<br>tablet you should also make sure you<br>have a built-in camera or microphone or<br>use a headset to minimize the<br>surrounding noise if you're using a<br>desktop you'll need to make sure you<br>have a webcam phone or headset just in<br>case of teachers choose to use online<br>live stations and most importantly<br>you'll need reliable broadband internet<br>connection and more information about<br>Moodle can be<br>using this link which will be able to<br>explore later and lastly from being this<br>infographic provides some detailed<br>information about online etiquette<br>should your teachers decide to use live<br>sessions so take some time to look<br>through this and refer to it in future<br>now I'm going to hand over to Melanie<br>he's going to take you to expectations<br>cured of the phone hello my name is<br>Melanie and I'm a student advisor that<br>works with both international and<br>domestic students in the casting<br>programs I'm the person you come to<br>achieve got any questions or queries and<br>I am the problem-solving together we'll<br>over the coming weeks so just as the<br>staff is committed to ensuring that you<br>achieve your goals so there are some<br>responsibilities we need to take on<br>board 13 anticipation the really<br>important student research is showing<br>that students who attend who participate<br>in who submit assessment will us the<br>learning is not a passive activity it's<br>not something that's done to you you<br>must be involved in the process you must<br>be some directed I'll talk more about<br>this in the next slide but it means you<br>have to take charge aligned learning the<br>University as a whole that's done in<br>students is committed to academic<br>integrity this means that we must all<br>act with honesty and and act ethically<br>in all of our dealings with University<br>and with each other<br>intimacy is linked to behavior in class<br>ended on campus and this includes as<br>Roxie discussed in the previous slide<br>online piecing is if you click on the<br>link the code on the link that for the<br>Cochin Student Conduct it will explain<br>to you the behaviour of the university<br>speaks and what might happen to a<br>student that doesn't quite follow their<br>combat don't do okay we're close<br>so this is your full-time job you'd only<br>have two full-time jobs we don't have<br>full-time work in full-time study decide<br>what's important to you and we can tell<br>you that it's very your workload will<br>consist of up to 17 hours of class a<br>week plus 20 hours are self-directed<br>learning so self-directed learning is<br>such things as researching reading in<br>any activities that will be asked to do<br>for your family by your own interests<br>each assessment is graded through the<br>semester and the grades for each<br>assessment accrue or enter and that<br>gives you your fame your final paper<br>grade as per the grading scale which is<br>on the slide we can discuss the students<br>are in the semester just to remind you<br>that your timetable on my work is that<br>only shows leaders so if your timetable<br>does not show you 16 hours that you're<br>missing some tasks so don't just rely on<br>that but any study skills I think in the<br>first week constructing your own<br>timetable which will show you your tasks<br>it's starting week two so neat just next<br>we meet face to face classes we - okay<br>between the page so this slide shows you<br>some of the agencies or places on campus<br>that you can get further support the<br>International Student Services office<br>can provide a range of support dealing<br>with issues some of these visas and<br>insurance anything that's going to help<br>you have a successful time with us<br>student learning support that that's a<br>university-wide system that provides<br>students with academic support in any<br>learning area we'd like you to come to<br>in the first instance because we are<br>experts not saying they're not but we<br>are these career services babe our<br>workshops for for drop-in sessions so<br>you can get further help and you'll<br>teach careers and the Student Union I<br>think sometimes people don't actually<br>they think they're just there for<br>parties but they actually would advocate<br>for you if you're having issues with<br>tenancy study links so they'll speak on<br>your behalf with studying English long<br>term prison and even if you have given<br>to some striking academic behavior so<br>with accessibility they are there to<br>have anybody that has challenges that<br>might impede their success okay the met<br>so please spend some time trying to find<br>what your classes are for you actually<br>come to us and you lose variables you<br>will miss out on valuable information if<br>you arrive 10 minutes late and if it was<br>me I wouldn't the patient that will be<br>able to so find your classroom so if you<br>click on their classrooms link it will<br>take you to their map once you know<br>where your rooms are the week to just<br>you know do a reconnaissance take time<br>to familiarize yourself with where your<br>classes are located in the week before<br>they start so that will be next week now<br>we're going to and I'm now currently<br>doing my transcripts so something I've<br>learned from the top program that I<br>think the biggest one is study skills<br>might sound boring but it's actually<br>super helpful I'm great<br>there's a really big thing for me so and<br>postgraduate study now I don't actually<br>use in tonight or any of the software<br>for reference they might not have enough<br>and that's because I also found that the<br>subject based papers prepared me for<br>first year and study skills prepared me<br>to tackle the assessments and the work<br>that needs to be done and critical<br>thinking allowed me to think about new<br>information assessor<br>and change my views and opinions based<br>on new information it sort of opened up<br>the way I think about the world down and<br>new advice question new student advice<br>would have to be to be organized<br>so definitely investment will planner<br>and the diary and if they ask that<br>allows you to write down you hear she's<br>nuts and Joe there's nothing worse than<br>having a polynomial and four hours of<br>studying cinema grade so yeah definitely<br>be organized bounce phone and as staff<br>abrasive make friends and people like<br>get to know prison your classes gets no<br>your lecture ins hears know where the<br>helpers on campus especially were things<br>that student services in the library<br>they have an enormous variety of<br>information and sources that can help<br>think it's very a lot of clear study and<br>I think it's really useful to know where<br>all the feathers and it gives no people<br>it's important ask questions yeah the<br>only dumb question and though I'm not<br>asked why I'm doing a majoring in<br>biology and psychology<br>probably one of the biggest thing that I<br>took away from capitals meaning many is<br>it was library because it's thanks cuz<br>paper and the critical thinking paper<br>was like the foundation of what I went<br>through with you need like especially<br>critical thinking really opens up your<br>mind that really makes you appreciate<br>all the information that's out there I<br>near the floor to question where<br>information was coming from I just<br>thought that once it was peer reviewed<br>or written by scientists that that was<br>there<br>anyway a question like the motives<br>behind why this paper was written who<br>was targeted these little things that<br>you will learn through your cup and I<br>found really is a cyclist a psychologist<br>you know some advice I will be giving<br>out to central new students I started<br>out as a biochemist and I'm is so good<br>indeed you know science paper you need<br>to be able to adapt and don't be afraid<br>of that if you found there are ways to<br>get around it's my job chemistry and our<br>biology psychology it now moves to me<br>stuff so yeah I just feel like don't be<br>afraid this collection is you can email<br>dubious pony PU disappearing you know<br>straights that when there are people out<br>electrical and electronic engineering<br>well in my opinion attending all the<br>lectures it's very important that a very<br>useful for your future studies because<br>like that well in the cards a tendency<br>is like it was 10% for each papers it's<br>not only a good mark to get but I've<br>also will stimulate good habits for you<br>to attend all the workshop all the<br>lectures and all the labs<br>well mmm for your future studies<br>attending all the lectures is not<br>compulsory so from my experience when<br>student will be they miss they stay at<br>home watch which watch reviews but I<br>don't think that's a lot where a good<br>well well because like so you'll be so<br>thank you very much and we wish you all<br>continued so these are you so this is<br>your priorities download the way can a<br>eunuch XO I downloaded it after seeing<br>Roxy downloaded it and these heaps of<br>stuff on me one of the things it's only<br>or is actually good student ID so if you<br>come to see me or you go anywhere you<br>need to give your ID number to this<br>we're going to ask you what's your ID<br>number and then you should be like and<br>then you fish around let's be able item<br>so if you download the app you'll have<br>your ID number the impulsivity else you<br>need to type as far as your student ID<br>cards concede you do need to have that<br>because if you set tests especially once<br>you leave us you're going to be there so<br>soon as you've supplied a photograph to<br>those two<br>sinter you'll be able to pick up your ID<br>card then you'll be a professional<br>student check your user name and<br>passwords like I said find your<br>classrooms using them at not all papers<br>have textbooks but differently business<br>definitely critical thought<br>definitely the sciences so get most<br>papers I need to tell you so like ROTC<br>signal technology you get rich expect<br>technology please let me know as soon as<br>possible so we can sort out some things<br>so now is the time where we want<br>inefficiency okay yes we at the moment<br>we haven't received any questions from<br>anyone so I assume that means that's<br>because we've been so comprehensive<br>amount of information I mean leave no<br>if you hang on a good question<br>thank you for asking where do you buy<br>your tips books for critical thought<br>there'll be a link on the Moodle page to<br>the e-book but there is a bookstore on<br>campus on the first level of the<br>students into and they most likely stop<br>all of your text box the other thing you<br>can do is the library has copies with<br>all the text books that we have chosen<br>so if it's taking you a while to get a<br>tip further in terms of the phone is not<br>available<br>you can access the one at the library<br>there is a couple of papers that have it<br>looks like Roxy has seen physics as an<br>e-book that you can access via the<br>library as well a good question we will<br>be released in Moodle that will be<br>Monday which is our first day of classes<br>and then we information on them each<br>Moodle page in terms of choosing them<br>workshops and that you are able to go to<br>resit one transfer is a completion<br>there should be a reset password link on<br>University of like a website if you have<br>any difficulty contact Melanie who will<br>help you to sort that out mostly of the<br>time you need to go through auctioneers<br>but it's quite a bit pricey so to only<br>much to attending the one-stop shop for<br>everything<br>Rubick and if you don't sure how to<br>contact Melanie directly you make<br>contact with the Hathaways College<br>reception and they'll make sure that you<br>get through to the right case should<br>look at however they need this in<br>Jasmine you need to supply Student<br>Center you can upload it so much<br>complete is it with waiting at Centro<br>and that's an interesting question as if<br>we're waiting until I completely<br>well we always recommend that our<br>students particularly income mid<br>semester start applying for degree<br>little study I'm not really sure what<br>you mean about that but we can catch up<br>shortly we do recommend that you stop<br>looking into what you want to do as far<br>as study skills maybe we do start to<br>look at the group training especially in<br>the last couple of weeks and then there<br>is an interview that you need to attend<br>with indeterminacies Melanie and part of<br>the purpose of there it's just important<br>to incur own role and your degree so the<br>best thing to do is keep an eye on and<br>the website look at different degrees<br>that you might want to do but we will be<br>following it up with your all your<br>training stuff this is my last<br>assignment we spent around a few more<br>days between oh so the last date<br>technically of the course is the Friday<br>of the second exam week there are no<br>exams for the calf or case courses but<br>if you look on the University of Waikato<br>website that will be the last special<br>day of classes painting in different<br>assessment items it might be due during<br>them period so taken it's interesting<br>one of the tutorials they've opened a<br>bit more tutorials on it maybe it's<br>changed in these two and so we will be<br>talking about that in week one and study<br>skills again part of the thing that<br>we're doing we fun let's look at your<br>timetable and encourage you to sign up<br>for all of the workshops after that in<br>study skills in this workshop will be<br>putting together a timetable of the<br>assistance that are due for you<br>depending on your papers for the<br>trimester but also your weekly schedule<br>as well so we work that out and make one<br>week one to two inch loose week shop<br>that's and we do and I totally have a<br>little bit your timetable to you know<br>music you to them so just to be really<br>clear there are no tutorials or<br>workshops or labs and week one at all<br>you're not expected to attend any of<br>those and week one but there will be<br>information on your Moodle and there<br>will be your lectures on Moodle so make<br>sure that you're active and looking at<br>what's going on<br>but you will not need to have any<br>face-to-face tutorials where jobs will<br>lives and weekly so if a former student<br>makes you might week one beast so enjoy<br>next week it'll be fine you'll find out<br>all about your course but thank you so<br>much for your questions it's been really<br>helpful to see the things that you need<br>to know if there's anything that you<br>haven't asked or that
