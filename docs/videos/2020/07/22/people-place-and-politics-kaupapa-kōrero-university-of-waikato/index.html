would<br>have seen<br>with the seating arrangements this<br>evening it's the first for all of us so<br>thank you<br>for your patience tonight's<br>kaupapa or kaupapa as you would have<br>seen<br>is an opportunity for us to consider a<br>topic that's<br>both globally and locally relevant<br>but what i wanted to do before i um just<br>introduce a topic more formally<br>is just explain how we're going to run<br>the evening so you'll see our panel who<br>i'll introduce<br>shortly they are going to speak<br>on their specific kaupapa for about<br>five min roughly five minutes um we do<br>have an opportunity for a question<br>and answer time and really this is an<br>opportunity as the<br>context of copa pakoriro embodies is<br>about an opportunity for you to ask<br>questions of our panel and so<br>i'm not sure in my notes here it says<br>that use of mobile phones is not<br>permitted actually tonight it is<br>for a specific purpose um i've just<br>learned how to use it so if i can use it<br>because i'm technologically deficient<br>i'm sure<br>you will all be able to so on the screen<br>at certain points um during the<br>presentations you'll see qr codes so if<br>you have a smartphone<br>you just point your phone i did it<br>myself so i know it works<br>at the qr code it will take you to the<br>app called slido<br>and from there you will be able to ask<br>questions so those questions can then<br>will then be moderated by<br>our deputy vice chancellor of research<br>professor bryony james<br>and once the panel have um finished<br>speaking<br>then we will be facilitating that<br>question and answer format<br>depending on how we go with that process<br>because again like the seating it's a<br>new one for us<br>and how time goes we may also have time<br>to have questions from the floor but<br>we'll just see how we go<br>we also as you would see we are a fully<br>female panel<br>this evening which is then an apology<br>from associate professor tom rua<br>unfortunately he has been caught up in<br>tamaki makoto<br>so given traffic and weather<br>he's tended his apologies for this<br>evening<br>but hopefully we will be able to engage<br>him at some further point in the future<br>one of the co-founders of black lives<br>matter global network<br>patrice khan colors wrote<br>as human beings we usually fight for the<br>things that move us out of complacency<br>we fight for clarity and truth telling<br>we fight for a world that we want our<br>children to live in<br>a world we want our communities to<br>thrive in<br>black lives matter was founded in 2013<br>and began as a call to action<br>in response to state-sanctioned violence<br>and anti-black racism<br>on the back of the acquittal of trayvon<br>martin's murderer<br>the murder of george floyd has refocused<br>attention<br>on the continued violence towards an<br>ongoing state-sanctioned<br>systemic oppression of black lives<br>the massive rallies and marches held<br>across the globe<br>in turn have forced many countries to<br>confront<br>the uncomfortable truths and histories<br>in the united states indigenous leaders<br>have spoken of the need for americans to<br>decolonize their minds<br>noting that the u.s history of white<br>supremacy<br>has stretched back to columbus's<br>discovery<br>and subsequent devastation through<br>introduced diseases<br>and forced relocations of thousands of<br>native<br>populations in canada<br>the rallies brought forth the dark<br>realities of canada's history of racism<br>against indigenous people<br>and the importance of ending white<br>silence on this history<br>in australia aboriginal leaders<br>highlighted that the conversation<br>around justice for indigenous people has<br>been ongoing for more than two centuries<br>but it took the death of george floyd in<br>the united states<br>for australians to begin to open their<br>for us here in aotearoa these<br>conversations have been<br>just as challenging recent events here<br>in kirikeriro<br>including the removal of the captain<br>hamilton statue<br>have again brought to the fore our own<br>uncomfortable histories<br>and the need to have those uncomfortable<br>conversations<br>as a university we are a part of that<br>system<br>but equally part of our purpose and<br>function is to enable spaces<br>for such uncomfortable conversations to<br>occur<br>tonight we draw inspiration from the<br>words of patrice<br>khan colors and who desire for us to<br>move out of complacency<br>to fight for the world where we want our<br>children to live in<br>and the world where we want our<br>communities to thrive<br>in the almari there is a saying that in<br>order to know where we are going<br>we first need to know where we have come<br>from and so tonight<br>our conversation focuses on<br>acknowledging and challenging privilege<br>the place of monuments memorialization<br>and historical reminders<br>and the power of language and naming<br>conventions<br>of<br>i'd like to take this opportunity now to<br>introduce our first speaker<br>kyla campbell kamadira who is the<br>waikato student union<br>if we're talking about engaging with<br>black lives matter<br>and cope above the same likeness here in<br>aotearoa<br>i think a serious part of this<br>conversation is the resistance that<br>occurs in engaging with these kaupapa<br>if we think of one of the key purposes<br>of black lives matter<br>it is anti-racist advocacy and that has<br>everything to do with the world<br>so yes every part of this conversation<br>needs to address engagement<br>because we need to be engaging and<br>active in the discourse<br>but we need to shed equal light on the<br>resistance<br>i want to focus this corridor on<br>self-determination<br>because i think this is what binds our<br>ground zero kaupapa together across the<br>world<br>no matter the people and no matter the<br>place there is politics at play<br>but what occurs that stands in the way<br>of self-determination<br>is the resistance of people who are<br>comfortable living in a colonial settler<br>fairy tale<br>that enforce their ideals their<br>philosophies<br>their versions of history and their<br>version of what is acceptable and not<br>in a way we're all engaging in versions<br>of black lives matter movement<br>but at varied levels of understanding<br>of knowledge of action experience<br>readjusting the focus to<br>self-determination<br>in an aotearoa new zealand context we<br>can't look past<br>te tiriti or waitangi the original<br>passport<br>that allows non-maori to even be here<br>which brings me to a question<br>what would the world look like if all<br>native treaties<br>were upheld not if colonization didn't<br>happen<br>but if treaties were upheld i think we'd<br>be having a significantly different<br>conversation here tonight<br>in regards to naming rights and<br>memorialization<br>thinking about our own territory and its<br>principles<br>we're having this conversation because<br>its principles have not been upheld<br>the rules of engagement have been<br>determined by colonial systems of<br>oppression<br>for too long and no degree no profession<br>it's within every maori experience that<br>resistance<br>has been and continues to be<br>an obstacle that stops maori from<br>achieving tino rangatiratanga<br>there are those who resist maori<br>achieving personal self-determination<br>and maori who resist being marginalized<br>the analogy of the double-edged sword<br>can be inserted here<br>tiwi maori have a history and tradition<br>of resistance<br>in the pursuit of protecting our mana<br>motuhake<br>our taunga our futures and our lives<br>resistance is liberating but how long is<br>enough<br>racial power imbalances are inherent in<br>our country<br>when we are supposed to be in<br>partnership participation<br>and protection together<br>current hegemonic practices of<br>westernization<br>doesn't allow any of the treaty<br>principles to be upheld<br>this is evidenced by the development of<br>a number of counter<br>strategies throughout the generations<br>that are more reflective of<br>appropriate and applicable to the maori<br>agenda<br>in modern day warfare these have been<br>our weapons against the system<br>tahimi henry once said that it is<br>preposterous that any maori<br>should aspire to become a poor pakiha<br>when the true destiny prescribed by the<br>creator<br>is to become a great maori<br>like black indigenous and people of<br>color across the world<br>we have ancestral legacies to uphold<br>we have our own stories of people<br>place and politics<br>don't resist us by honoring the treaty<br>we are bringing you with us the message<br>i want to share with you all tonight<br>is that black lives matter principles<br>are totally applicable<br>to our experience here in aotearoa and<br>new zealand<br>our support of international kaupapa<br>like black lives matter<br>sends a message to our citizens our<br>government<br>our nation the world<br>that collectivized self-determination<br>shall not be defeated<br>and if we're willing to support a<br>kaupapa thousands of kilometers away<br>then damn sure we won't give up<br>addressing the inequity<br>racism and injustice faced by tangata<br>whenua here<br>on our own whenua by supporting kaupapa<br>like black lives matter and amplifying<br>their voices<br>the echoes won't fade out in our south<br>pacific safe haven<br>our kaupapa and aotearoa demand<br>the same energy as we're putting into<br>black lives matter<br>we're multifaceted people although our<br>feet may stand firmly on our whenua<br>our wairua transcends beyond places we<br>can't even fathom<br>it's not a one or the other thing our<br>belief<br>and our being tells us what we're<br>gilda<br>so just for those of you around the qr<br>code or the<br>app um please you can begin typing your<br>questions now<br>um while you're thinking about them and<br>why kyla's presentation is fresh in your<br>mind<br>um i'd like now to introduce our next<br>speaker<br>makuri<br>everyone um not many people call me<br>sandra lee<br>only my mother when i'm really<br>misbehaving um but anyway<br>um i just want to take some time to<br>acknowledge our ngati wairere and<br>waikato tainui<br>and the land on which we stand today i'm<br>honoured to be here<br>i'm a teaching fellow and a doctoral<br>student here at waikato<br>and i also work for maiwe ngati kudi in<br>building<br>working partnerships with science within<br>science<br>and research institutions in that work i<br>bring our people together with<br>i bring our people together with<br>scientists to exchange<br>knowledge and co-author the naming of<br>seaweed<br>newly found seaweed and today really is<br>an opportunity for us to engage in a<br>conversation<br>that is exciting and hopeful for some<br>and yet confronting<br>and uncomfortable for others it's a<br>conversation that must be had<br>today i will tell two stories i touch on<br>my recent<br>recent personal experience and as well<br>as my<br>experience as an academic and publishing<br>scientific article naming a new seaweed<br>both expose the underbelly of racism<br>while also highlighting the importance<br>of naming our world i begin with my<br>personal story and i wrote this while i<br>was working on my phd<br>my mind and my pen kept coming back to<br>george<br>george floyd so i wrote about my<br>experience in conversations with old<br>friends<br>around black lives matter the removal of<br>colonial statues<br>and the suggested name changes in our te<br>arua<br>and this is what i wrote racism is a<br>daily reality<br>in my social circles i pride myself on<br>the fact that i have maintained<br>mother friendships from my childhood<br>from my from my hometown<br>i believe these relationships were deep<br>based on love<br>acceptance and kindness and i quickly<br>found out<br>i was wrong i find myself bombarded with<br>by racist comments on facebook<br>posted by people i called friends people<br>i'd known my entire life my so-called<br>friends was spouting white lives matter<br>all lives matter as black people<br>people of color and indigenous died and<br>cried<br>and acted out in pain and anger<br>they complain about the proposed name<br>changes at pubs<br>and spew racist comments they insist<br>name changes will and remove<br>statues won't change anything perhaps<br>it is their fear that it will change<br>everything<br>that makes them stamp their feet like a<br>spoiled<br>racist child my heart aches and my anger<br>rages<br>as i revisit the racist racism of my<br>hometown<br>i cared about these people so for a<br>short while i spent time<br>explaining teaching sharing my personal<br>my tribal my whanau experiences<br>i was met with changes hard<br>given uh my people suffered two example<br>told to move on asked<br>won't the treaty become null and void if<br>we decolonize<br>what hope and hell did i have in<br>creating a space for multi-naming<br>and science if there was no space for me<br>and the lives of my friends easy answer<br>ditch those people with racist minds<br>they are not my friends<br>done the more complex task is to<br>identify<br>allies and people whose minds are open<br>and kind and the process of doing<br>let's just say my facebook friend list<br>is dwindling really quickly these days<br>shrinking as we speak<br>naming people the naming of people place<br>in our physical material and<br>metaphysical world<br>reflects the political will of society<br>and<br>institutions a discussion on the social<br>and political power to name our world<br>is often excluded by those who make the<br>rules<br>to name it as i mentioned earlier nazi<br>kudi are engaging in the naming of new<br>seaweeds<br>one challenge we've faced is in the<br>publishing of an article discussing a<br>newly named seaweed<br>we had co-authored both the article and<br>the texan of that seaweed<br>or to manawatafi our article did a great<br>job of naming and describing the species<br>under the scientific regulations and<br>standards<br>but articulating maori language context<br>and content<br>was questioned and rejected rejected<br>quickly by the editor<br>who refused to send it on for a peer<br>review<br>the editor argued that the article<br>contained excessive<br>tear tereon maori there was a total of<br>nine maori words<br>hardly excessive the editor reasoned<br>that the international scientific<br>community would struggle with the<br>language<br>and not be interested in the social and<br>political will<br>of ngatikuti to name their world the<br>editor questioned<br>how acknowledging ngati kudi as kaitiaki<br>is relevant to take tsunami<br>in the context of the treaty and with<br>the increasing international emphasis<br>on incorporation indigenous and local<br>knowledge<br>knowledge all scientists need to be<br>aware of the con<br>cultural context in which they are<br>working and thinking<br>to cut a long story short we pulled the<br>article<br>and it was published last year in a<br>canadian scientific journal<br>while ngati kudi and our scientific<br>partners grapple with the<br>with negotiating co-authorship and pos<br>and there are positive outcomes<br>participation and engagement makes space<br>for indigenous co-authorship<br>and publication academic<br>publications while also deepening<br>knowledge<br>connections relationships between people<br>place and politics the point i make as<br>the<br>as resistance resistance sits within the<br>institutions in which we exist<br>we must identify who allies are<br>and who and where resistance to change<br>sits both are now personal lives and<br>within the academy<br>naming our world is central to the<br>indigenous movement towards further<br>decolonisation<br>and i just want to finish with by coming<br>back to the piece i wrote while<br>thinking about george floyd and the<br>racism<br>of my friends because it relates quite<br>deeply to my<br>academic experience as well<br>i cry tears on my mother's shoulder as i<br>scream i just want to punch them in the<br>throat<br>the emotions the rage and the mouth are<br>hard to control<br>she calms me she holds me she tells me i<br>have outgrown them<br>their minds are small they are<br>uneducated<br>you have important work to do and you<br>must do it graciously<br>i understand that my pain is also hers<br>and i use this as a reminder and as a<br>source<br>of determination to write out systemic<br>institutional<br>our final panelist tonight is professor<br>tina<br>i would just like to say at the outset<br>that it's a real privilege<br>sharing the stage tonight with these<br>as sarah said in her introduction of<br>course the black lives matter movement<br>while we know it has its roots in the<br>u.s it's prompted protests<br>across many parts of the world and<br>including uh here in aterua<br>so one of the topics as you'll know<br>that's been prompting a lot of<br>dissension has been statues<br>and um the statues have already been<br>mentioned this evening<br>statues are a way of memorializing the<br>past<br>and of course past often built on<br>slavery<br>colonisation and racism<br>they aren't just backdrops to daily life<br>but they're intended to commemorate what<br>societies value<br>in the black lives matter movement since<br>the tragic killing of george floyd<br>on the 25th of may has helped cast light<br>on many statues around the world and so<br>i want to take the opportunity this<br>evening to reflect on a couple<br>in kirikeriru but<br>actually not just those that memorialize<br>colonisation<br>statues reflect power relations across<br>numerous axes of power<br>so race and colonisation are very<br>important ones for this evening<br>but also class gender and sexuality<br>so i want to start by focusing on a<br>statue<br>that actually resists dominant power<br>relations and that is riff raff<br>which many of you will be familiar with<br>the riffraff statue in victoria street<br>celebrates the iconic<br>riffraff character from the time warping<br>alien from the planet transsexual<br>from the rocky horror picture show and<br>as many of you will know of course it<br>stands on the now demolished embassy<br>theatre site where richard o'brien<br>who played riff raff in the movie used<br>to spend time<br>so riffraff is not the norm as far as<br>statues go<br>and when a colleague and i finished a<br>book manuscript on how sexuality affects<br>the way people interact with<br>with place we asked our us-based editor<br>if we could have hamilton's own riffraff<br>statue on the cover<br>she wasn't entirely convinced about that<br>but we eventually got her over the line<br>so another statue or monument though<br>that also conveys a theme of sexual<br>difference<br>is the gay liberation monument in a park<br>close to stonewall inn which is a gay<br>club in greenwich village in new york<br>so in 1969 an uprising took place<br>in when police violently raided the bar<br>and patrons<br>fought back the uprisings widely<br>considered to constitute one of the most<br>important events leading to the gay<br>liberation movement<br>in the in the us and the gay liberation<br>monument completed in 1980 features two<br>gay men<br>and two lesbians so the bronze statues<br>are covered in white lacquer but in<br>2015 prompted by black lives matter<br>activists<br>they painted there was the painting of<br>these two figures faces brown to protest<br>the way the statues what the activists<br>called<br>white washer movement so they argue that<br>this<br>was actually a movement led by black and<br>brown queer and trans people<br>so they painted the statues brown and<br>dressed them in wigs<br>and bright costumes so statues are often<br>contested which brings me back to recent<br>events<br>in kirikariro so as many of you<br>know of course on the 25th of june a<br>crane hoisted a bronze sculpture of<br>captain hamilton<br>from civic square after threats from<br>local maori<br>and anti-racism protesters to topple it<br>the controversial statue was donated to<br>the council in 2013<br>and mayor paula southgate has said i<br>quote<br>i know many people find the statue<br>personally and<br>culturally offensive we can't ignore<br>what is happening<br>but another statue that's received less<br>attention in kirikariroa is the family<br>it's the farming family which is donated<br>by sir bob jones<br>it was unveiled in 1990 at the southern<br>junction of ulster and victoria streets<br>and it depicts a so-called ordinary<br>farming family it consists of a<br>life-size<br>figure of a man a woman two children<br>a dog a cow and a sheep and the statues<br>intended to celebrate the role of the<br>farming family in history<br>but it sparked some controversy a few<br>years ago for showing<br>in fact a very eurocentric history of<br>the wakarun<br>so all landscapes reflect these power<br>relations of gender and<br>sexuality class but also and of course<br>key to tonight's panel discussion<br>ethnicity race racism and colonisation<br>so we all interpret landscapes<br>every day we look at tagging on walls<br>manicured lawns<br>signs on shops and they convey to us<br>these impressions of poverty or wealth<br>of diversity or homogeneity<br>but also feelings of whether we belong<br>or don't belong somewhere<br>and so the question is really what<br>should we do<br>with existing statues<br>we can create new ones in our future<br>and a colleague had suggested to me that<br>maybe we could have one of the<br>anti-springbok protesters who'd blocked<br>the hamilton rugby match in 1981.<br>but what about those existing statues<br>they're statues of old statues of slave<br>traders of colonisers of farming<br>families<br>should they be removed painted beheaded<br>toppled or perhaps as touhou maori<br>activist<br>once suggested all placed together where<br>people can talk about<br>recently professor paul spoonley<br>commented<br>public statues and monuments should be<br>kept so people can be reminded about the<br>good<br>and bad events of new zealand history<br>but i'm actually not so sure that<br>there's a one-size-fits-all answer to my<br>question<br>the black lives matter movement<br>illustrates well to me at least<br>that there are many people who don't<br>want to be continually reminded of the<br>bad events of history<br>there are enough effects of racism and<br>colonisation in people's lives serving<br>as daily reminders<br>so actually to return to mayor southgate<br>again she also recently commented that<br>we need to have these<br>brave and honest discussions about the<br>past something again sarah mentioned in<br>her introduction and i agree<br>so each monument its specific<br>context the communities of people it<br>stands amongst<br>needs to be thought about carefully we<br>need<br>to have courageous conversations<br>each from our different embodied<br>positions<br>so just by way of an example a few<br>months ago in the us<br>the library of virginia held what it<br>called a civic<br>conversation about monuments it was free<br>open to the public and part of a small<br>group discussion series<br>encouraging informed conversations<br>around complex topics affecting the<br>state of virginia<br>so every two weeks the library screens a<br>segment from a documentary<br>film followed by a roundtable<br>conversation<br>with input from a moderator and a<br>historical<br>expert from the library so people who go<br>along are encouraged<br>to share their perspectives with the<br>group and i offer this actually just as<br>one very small example of one of the<br>many steps we could take to help support<br>freedom liberation justice<br>these all being very important<br>cornerstones of course of the black<br>gilda<br>thank you robin um that concludes our<br>panel<br>um session and what we have is<br>um still a small window of opportunity<br>for you to submit your questions<br>via slider or using the qr code<br>and that will stay open until i walk<br>back to my chair<br>so type quick those of you who have a<br>burning question<br>and once i sit down we'll begin reading<br>through<br>the questions that have been posed to<br>the panel by yourselves this evening kia<br>ora<br>i didn't walk very slowly<br>sorry so i hope you type fast um<br>but hopefully that also gave an<br>opportunity for the transition<br>um in terms of our mic so i can hear<br>that they're working<br>so the way that this works is that i'll<br>read the questions um that you've put<br>forward and some of them have been posed<br>to direct members of the panel and<br>others<br>are more general questions so<br>if i could just start actually with you<br>kyla<br>as a question what does being an ally<br>look like<br>um what would your advice be and perhaps<br>start with kyla but i think<br>actually all the panel would be useful<br>to answer that<br>what does an ally look like what does an<br>ally look like oh that's tough<br>um an ally looks like<br>they they are actively<br>seeking education having conversations<br>but also removing themselves from the<br>spotlight and leading those<br>conversations<br>and just really learning about<br>the people that they're trying to be<br>if if you want to be an ally of my<br>maori self then you're pronouncing<br>maori correctly you're pronouncing my<br>names correctly<br>and we're having uncomfortable<br>conversations<br>naturally for the purpose of<br>making the world a better place for all<br>people alike<br>not just indigenous and non-maori but<br>just<br>um to me i think an ally looks like<br>somebody who listens<br>i think there's a lot of noise going on<br>in the world right now<br>and not a lot of people are listening<br>and in the conversations that i have<br>with my friends and some colleagues<br>they often speak over me when i'm trying<br>to tell my story so listening to me<br>is really important but also i think an<br>ally looks like somebody who steps back<br>off that platform and invites you on to<br>the stage<br>um to speak your stories uh your kaupapa<br>and your your desires so yeah<br>to me it looks like somebody who steps<br>back and<br>listens with their heart and their soul<br>yeah<br>i'm not sure what i can add to the<br>wisdom already here beside me<br>but i i would certainly agree with all<br>of those comments<br>i think for me from a position of<br>whiteness in supporting<br>for example a movement like black lives<br>matter<br>it's about very much sandy about about<br>listening<br>about learning about being prepared<br>not always thinking one can step up and<br>know and lead<br>but actually just at times taking a back<br>seat and being prepared<br>again to be vulnerable to be directed by<br>others<br>thank you perhaps a follow-up question<br>um again<br>on being a pakiha ally specifically<br>and the question around how marty can<br>tricky is it really our work to do that<br>you know that's what i think i think<br>we've we've lived in a world where we've<br>kind of<br>um had to adjust and and navigate<br>a parking world for so long that perhaps<br>this is work that needs to be done by<br>pakia<br>for pakia but also for maori so<br>in my mind i i actually you know i'm not<br>sure it's<br>it's really our work to do we've been<br>doing it long enough<br>um how maori can support<br>pakiha to become allies i think it's<br>really hard because<br>we're trying to seek our own<br>self-determination<br>and have and have an equitable platform<br>as pakiha as pakeha do<br>or non-maori in general and so<br>it's something that i've experienced you<br>know<br>helping along my non-maori colleagues or<br>friends<br>in the university space but i think the<br>beautiful thing about<br>being in the university space is that<br>it doesn't have to be a<br>self-responsibility thing all the time<br>we're having these<br>my role then might turn to inviting<br>people to listen to these conversations<br>the the onus is on you personally<br>because that<br>the emotional trauma that comes with<br>that is really difficult to manage at<br>the same time<br>but i think overall this question<br>has sown the seed in my mind<br>to think more about how if i'm<br>asking non-maori to not resist us<br>how am i showing them that they're<br>open and free to come to our spaces as<br>well<br>so i think this question is more an<br>afterthought for me<br>um and and the mahi that i intend to do<br>into the future<br>thank you robin perhaps if we start<br>with you with this question why do you<br>think we<br>we being typical people can relate<br>to the issues in the usa<br>for example black lives matter and<br>george floyd<br>while not seeing the parallel issues<br>how can we relate to what's happening in<br>the states um but not see the parallel<br>issues here and i'll tell new zealand<br>i i would have i would hope that most<br>people in<br>seeing what's going on in the united<br>states with the black lives matter<br>movement<br>would be able to see and relate and<br>understand<br>that there are very important uh<br>parallels within the kind of power<br>relations that exist in aterua<br>perhaps there are people who don't see<br>that but<br>take what we're seeing in the u.s take<br>what we're seeing in other countries<br>around the world<br>and to filter that through into our own<br>local context and<br>it's it's the geographer and me sandy<br>and you too i'm sure<br>um and we do tend to think about<br>the world in terms of scales from local<br>through to<br>you know their cities and regional and<br>national and international and so on and<br>i would have thought that those threads<br>run all the way through<br>yeah thank you i just want to<br>focus a little bit around the concept of<br>resistance<br>and particularly around the statement<br>around resistance being found<br>everywhere so how do we work around it<br>in terms of our naming practices and<br>conventions<br>maybe we could start again with you the<br>question of resistance<br>being found everywhere so how do we work<br>around it<br>in terms of our naming practices<br>yeah i don't i think that's right<br>actually<br>resistance is found everywhere but it's<br>a it's an enormously<br>complex concept because it sits in<br>relation to<br>domination and kind of not not in a<br>simplistic binary but wherever you have<br>relations of power and dominance you<br>you have resistance to that um and<br>that resistance can happen again right<br>sort of<br>at localized levels from the ground up<br>to quite globalized kinds of resistance<br>so<br>i think we have to seize all of those<br>opportunities to recognize resistance<br>celebrate resistance and know that it<br>it is happening all around us so there's<br>a um<br>there's a thinker that some of you in<br>the room might be aware of a<br>actually a french philosopher michel<br>foucault<br>and he's done a lot of work on this idea<br>of resistance he says that<br>power isn't just some kind of simplistic<br>relationship<br>between a dominant party and someone who<br>resists<br>power kind of works much more in a<br>circular relationship<br>it it threads its way through much more<br>in a web-like<br>kind of a way and therefore that means<br>that no matter<br>how hopeless it might feel at times<br>there is actually always capacity there<br>for resistance<br>even if that's at the most simplistic<br>level<br>you might feel completely overwhelmed by<br>someone and unable to speak back to them<br>but they might turn their back and you<br>might<br>poke your tongue out at them that's<br>resistance you know and<br>but we need to seize that and and hold<br>um i sort of also see resistance in our<br>institutions and particularly in our<br>naming<br>processes um you know resistance to<br>change<br>resistance to evolve and resisting<br>um sharing power um<br>i'm not sure what i'm getting at right<br>now but so so i think resistance<br>is is a really interesting concept<br>there's those of us who resist<br>um uh inequalities<br>and marginalization but then resistance<br>also sits<br>within these institutions when it comes<br>to sharing that platform and that space<br>to name our world<br>um so in my mind i'm thinking<br>how can we change that how can we make<br>naming processes more accessible to<br>people<br>and i think it's around um<br>and being more flexible in those rules<br>of naming<br>you know we had an interesting um<br>experience<br>through the naming of that uh te korowai<br>or to manawafa<br>uh manawatafi um and we named that<br>collectively<br>so like usually a scientist's name will<br>go<br>on the end of a texan and that will sort<br>of say<br>who discovered it and who holds the<br>knowledge around it<br>and with our engagement with that we<br>kind of went well we don't want to put<br>our individual names on it<br>we want to put our tribal name on it so<br>we named the entire tribe<br>and that was something that hasn't been<br>done very often<br>and so in actual fact through engaging<br>in<br>naming seaweeds we're sort of reshaping<br>the rules<br>and the way that our our flora and fauna<br>is named<br>and so in some forms we're resisting the<br>rules<br>and in some forms there has been some<br>resistance to<br>us reshaping those rules so yeah<br>interesting question<br>um a situation comes to mind and<br>we're talking about the black lives<br>matter movement and<br>it's at its peak in the states at the<br>moment<br>and if we hear stories of what's<br>happening<br>and it's happening here in aotearoa<br>at a different scale but the resistance<br>is in the fact that<br>you can every day in new zealand they<br>can highlight the inequity and the<br>racism and the injustice that's<br>happening in the states<br>because you're not physically required<br>to be there and to be active<br>and so resistance is being seen can be<br>seen<br>as in an outdoor context you can see<br>that but<br>you're not willing to put yourself<br>physically in that space to<br>address that racism and inequity and<br>inequality<br>and injustice and<br>that was some of the corded or that i<br>was hoping to touch on in my five<br>minutes<br>and that's precisely why we are having<br>this discussion<br>um but like i say resistance is<br>liberating as well<br>um we've had some of our greatest wins<br>as maori dim for maori dim<br>as a result of resistance maori language<br>petition<br>but we're still being resisted<br>by the treaty not being honoured<br>and we can have a discussion about the<br>treaty if there's<br>lead off from that statement that i just<br>made<br>resistance is systemically<br>um is a as a systemic obstacle<br>that doesn't allow maori<br>to be self-governing and in partnership<br>with not even just pakiha but the people<br>that<br>make the rules and make the decisions<br>and that's a wider conversation that<br>that shouldn't take away from the black<br>lives matter movement<br>but is equally um we can see that<br>those same uh daru<br>the core source of<br>the fafi over in the states exists here<br>in aotearoa too<br>and so we we can't be blind to the fact<br>that it does happen here but be so<br>woke to what's happening across the<br>world<br>so there's two two parts i guess um so<br>it's a great segue actually into the<br>the question around treaties and the<br>need for treaties to be upheld or<br>the question is around treaties or<br>statement treaties are supposed to be<br>upheld<br>particularly a reference to the<br>undrap or united nations rights of<br>indigenous peoples<br>so why do you think well i guess you've<br>already mentioned<br>um your thoughts about in some respects<br>about why treaties are not being<br>um honored and do you have any<br>additional thoughts and perhaps also<br>open to the panel<br>around why they aren't and more<br>specifically<br>what are we doing perhaps not just us as<br>indigenous people but us as a nation<br>around honouring of those treaties i<br>think if we were to talk about our<br>own tediti or waitangi and the<br>principles of partnership<br>straight away my mind goes to protection<br>is not being upheld<br>if our children are still being uplifted<br>by state care<br>and being abused in those systems that's<br>participation is not having seven maori<br>seats<br>of 120 seats in our<br>house of representatives and those are<br>small those are few but massive<br>examples as to why territory of waitangi<br>is not<br>i think tiriti is not being upheld<br>because<br>you know the powers that be don't want<br>to share the power<br>you know i really fully agree with what<br>you said and and you know when<br>when it comes to sharing power from a<br>dominant um<br>society that's also about losing power<br>and i think that is a is a huge um<br>barrier to to actually honoring the<br>treaty in<br>its full um capacity<br>so yeah that's about all i'd like<br>because what you said was so eloquent<br>it's it's challenging to move from the<br>status quo<br>it's um usually in life it's not<br>revolutions that do that it's bit by a<br>bit<br>above it and it does it does feel like<br>there's<br>a lot of chipping away that happens at<br>the hegemony or those<br>hegemonic power relations that takes<br>often a lot a lot of years<br>and then you can feel as though there's<br>been<br>a gaining of ground and then a kind of<br>slipping back<br>again uh into those um<br>the hegemony again so i think it's it's<br>a challenge<br>there's no one reason why if<br>we could point to that it would be much<br>easier but it's<br>so multifaceted as to why<br>power works across so many different<br>axes we're talking about<br>politics here around tonight about<br>around slavery and colonisation and race<br>and ethnicity but<br>um of course it we're all human beings<br>that are<br>we're also we're gendered we have<br>certain sexualities we you know<br>on on and on ago certain body shape<br>certain and some of these um afford us<br>with certain privileges in life and<br>other axes of identity mean that we have<br>less privilege in other<br>other spaces and other aspects so it's<br>certainly<br>enormously complex i guess picking up on<br>the<br>notion of complexity and the<br>multifaceted nature of our lives<br>but also more around the privileging of<br>voices one question<br>is around the role of mainstream media<br>and<br>how well i guess the question is<br>has mainstream media been or contributed<br>to<br>this issue around privileging of certain<br>and then what is the alternative i guess<br>would be my follow-up<br>how do we work to rewrite well not so<br>much to rewrite<br>but to provide the space for other<br>well i i can start but absolutely<br>many mainstream media certainly upheld<br>the power relations that are in place<br>and um i i think that<br>it's enormously important that we<br>keep thinking about that and challenging<br>that because<br>those sort of more traditional<br>mainstream or<br>media outlets they don't just<br>reflect what's going on they play an<br>active role in<br>shaping what's going on so in other<br>words you can't<br>separate out what sometimes called the<br>discourse or the representation or the<br>discursive<br>from the real from those actions that<br>lived experienced there on the ground<br>those two things are<br>intimately connected so i think one way<br>in which we can<br>try and address that is by having<br>multiple voices as many voices as we can<br>from many different positions so that we<br>end up having the brave the courageous<br>the difficult conversations not just<br>one dominant line that we keep getting<br>through over and over again<br>i agree with that especially around the<br>um dominant voice of the media<br>it actually can be a um a really<br>dangerous<br>place an unsafe place to sort of be<br>reading and stuff<br>and i think there's there's there's also<br>um the capacity for people to<br>to invent news and to invent discourse<br>and and and sort of<br>really um<br>put their opinions out there in the<br>public space a lot more today and in<br>some ways that<br>is um their voices if they belong to the<br>dominant society then that gets more<br>traction<br>and on we go and and and yeah on we go<br>and i think that one way to resolve that<br>is to make space for<br>for the less dominant people to actually<br>be heard in our<br>um you know in multi tv and<br>in our in our news and in our media<br>i don't have much more to add to those<br>for karol but<br>my line of thinking is that in<br>mainstream<br>channels we do have maori programs and<br>and pacific programs but they're not at<br>prime time viewing and so is that good<br>enough<br>is it good enough that our news<br>presenters say kia ora new zealand and<br>and that's it but the but the news that<br>they're reporting on is<br>specifically for an audience<br>when it's not current affairs it's<br>specifically for an audience<br>that<br>don't want to have the uncomfortable<br>conversation so they won't<br>give the uncomfortable conversations um<br>that we should be reporting on<br>in our biggest sort of media sector<br>and that's an avenue of having those<br>conversations<br>and so those are yeah that's my fakado<br>but<br>um you know recently we've had the maori<br>media shift<br>mandated from a government level and so<br>that's<br>that's a prime example of the<br>marginalization of maori voices to shift<br>those programs that we finally do have<br>on on mainstream channels um shifting<br>them<br>and marginalizing them to channel 19<br>where you have the power and capacity to<br>view that content<br>if you want to and and<br>that's not that's not equity i don't<br>think<br>um i want to um there are a couple of<br>questions which<br>are very similar so um i'll kind of<br>rephrase them<br>and they're both forward thinking<br>questions<br>um so for all of the panel how can<br>pakeha maori and other members of our<br>community here in hamilton work together<br>to create a safer and more supportive<br>city in altitude new zealand and i think<br>probably more about if you had the<br>opportunity<br>what would that vision of our future<br>i think having the uncomfortable<br>conversations without having the fear of<br>being punished for having conversations<br>and and drudging up conversations that<br>need to be had<br>or 180 year long conversations that<br>needed to<br>need to be had and so<br>i think the biggest punishment is<br>violence<br>and its marginalization of maori voices<br>we've had commentary lately from people<br>that say that they won't<br>hire maori people<br>as their employees and so violence can<br>be seen in many ways and can be<br>experienced<br>in many ways and<br>and it's violence<br>by bringing up trauma violence by<br>punishing people for being<br>who they are violence<br>upon people who are just trying to make<br>the human experience<br>better by having uncomfortable<br>conversations<br>but are being punished for it because of<br>the resistance that is happening<br>daily<br>i think for me the vision for the future<br>would be<br>really about having holding<br>practicing true partnership a true<br>treaty partnership and and seeing um<br>multi faces multi voices uh multi<br>participation<br>across the board politically um and<br>environmental management<br>and so forth and just having a more<br>balanced<br>um shared power across our spaces<br>yeah yeah i<br>i absolutely agree sandy i think those<br>again those concepts of the<br>um so integral to the black lives matter<br>movement and justice and equity and<br>um i i think having having<br>a more equitable society across all of<br>those areas education<br>health justice system would be a huge<br>start<br>towards having a society in which<br>everybody felt<br>much more valued than perhaps many<br>how we get there how we get there's the<br>daily<br>the daily struggle but a society where<br>we didn't have a huge disparity<br>in wealth and all the different outcomes<br>political social<br>economic and so on i think would be my<br>where i would want to i want to head in<br>the future<br>thank you um just for our audience<br>um before i bring this session to a<br>close for those of you who may be asking<br>why<br>these panelists um<br>is an opportunity for the university to<br>present to<br>our community including our university<br>community but<br>beyond our university community some of<br>our students and researchers and<br>academics<br>who have been working in the space or<br>who are studying in this space<br>and so our panelists tonight which would<br>have included associate professor tom<br>voor<br>are all as you would have heard active<br>in this space and have been for some<br>time so<br>if you could i would like you to join me<br>in thanking our panel members<br>um i'd also like to take this<br>opportunity to thank all of you for<br>coming out tonight it's not been the<br>greatest in terms of weather<br>um but for us as a university coming out<br>of lockdown<br>and understanding how we navigate these<br>types of important spaces for us<br>it's been wonderful to have you with us<br>this evening so my final<br>kind of as i get my instructions here um<br>do follow us on the university of<br>waikato on eventbrite and facebook<br>for the update of the next kaupapa<br>series and the date and topic which will<br>be announced in due course<br>uh<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
