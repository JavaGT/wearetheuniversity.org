to<br>degree level study at a new zealand<br>university<br>by giving students who do not meet the<br>academic eligibility criteria<br>the equivalent of university entrance<br>you will study alongside other students<br>so you'll get to meet a wide variety of<br>people during your time<br>with us in these foundation programs<br>you'll be introduced to a university<br>learning environment<br>where you attend a mix of lectures for<br>the semester they will be<br>online tutorials workshops and labs<br>depending on the paper that you are<br>enrolled in<br>i would now like to introduce the<br>teaching team who will be teaching on<br>this program this trimester<br>so firstly i am the lecturer for study<br>skills and this is a compulsory paper<br>for most of you<br>so i'll be seeing you throughout the<br>course the purpose of this paper is to<br>support you to develop positive learning<br>practices<br>that will enhance your success at<br>university in this paper we will look at<br>effective learning strategies such as<br>note taking goal setting planning<br>and reflection we'll also learn about<br>reading and writing<br>in an academic context it sounds like a<br>bit of a boring paper<br>but i can assure you you're going to<br>have a lot of fun together throughout<br>our course<br>i would now like to introduce you to<br>roxanna and she's going to be teaching<br>introduction to<br>critical thought and expression good<br>point<br>not teaching right now for the offshore<br>students<br>um come on elise take it away yeah on<br>the next one<br>so i'm my least width and it's very<br>exciting to meet you<br>even though you are not here in person<br>but we have had some practice um<br>having students off<br>campus and we got used to it<br>so you've got the benefit that we've<br>learned a lot over the<br>semester and you should really feel<br>assured that<br>you will not feel like you are distant<br>we we try our very best to make you part<br>of what we are doing here and and to<br>make you feel like you are close<br>so i'm going to present the business<br>papers and if that is something that you<br>are interested in as a career<br>then i would really recommend that you<br>take both of these papers<br>the one is called bridging for business<br>and the other one is preaching for<br>accounting<br>but in these two papers we actually<br>cover<br>six areas now when you go into business<br>studies at the university of waikato<br>those six papers will all form part of<br>your first year of study<br>so you will learn in my course and the<br>concepts<br>and you'll get your first round of<br>getting used to<br>these six papers so those<br>supply chain and then on the other side<br>in the bridging for business<br>we've got strategic management and also<br>going to look at marketing<br>which is very exciting as well as<br>digital business<br>and those are areas that i know you are<br>all interested in<br>so i'm excited to learn from you because<br>i'm sure i will<br>and i hope that you will be able to<br>learn a lot in the class when you<br>thank you i'm sanduja<br>i'll be teaching you bridging physics<br>the speed trimester<br>and we all know that there are some<br>rules that govern<br>the universe so i'm excited to teach you<br>how those how we can build advanced<br>technologies<br>with those simple rules um this will be<br>your first paper<br>first introductory paper into the into<br>the world of stem<br>so i hope you will have a great<br>experience learning it and like marley<br>said<br>we've learned a lot from the a trimester<br>of how to do this<br>really well online so we'll be learning<br>from you as well so i look forward to<br>seeing you all next week<br>there is a couple of our teaching team<br>who can't be with us today and they<br>wanted to share some<br>information about their papers with you<br>as well<br>hello everyone my name is martin gringo<br>i teach the two mathematics papers here<br>at by catholic athletics college<br>reading mathematics and statistics and<br>bridging countless<br>teaching math is for students who do not<br>have a strong background in maths<br>while bridging calculus is those who<br>will have a very strong background in<br>mathematics<br>either paper will however allow you to<br>do mathematics<br>at the best level that is if you pass it<br>in the first two weeks you have the<br>chance to change<br>from one paper to the other if you find<br>it hard<br>and easy i will support you throughout<br>this process<br>hello everyone my name is gerald in<br>greenhouse<br>and i teach english to international<br>students<br>and i just want to tell you a little bit<br>about courses<br>so there are two courses there's english<br>one and there's english too<br>and both courses aim to help you develop<br>your<br>reading strategies build up your<br>academic vocabulary<br>and practice paraphrasing and essay<br>writing<br>we also do a lot of practice in oral<br>communication<br>and you get the chance to design and<br>deliver<br>two oral presentations<br>i hope these skills will give you the<br>foundation that you need to complete<br>your foundation studies<br>and your next step when you start your<br>degree<br>course so i wish you all the best<br>and i hope to see you on campus soon<br>bye thank you everyone we're now going<br>to hear a little bit about studying<br>online from rockstar<br>so to ensure that you're successful in<br>your online learning journey there are a<br>few things that you need to pay<br>attention to<br>as you go along in your journey but the<br>first one that's really important is the<br>technology check<br>so in order to be successful in your<br>online studies you'll need to ensure<br>that you have<br>some of the following if not all of them<br>so a laptop or tablet and a charger<br>candy for your live online sessions<br>with a built-in camera and microphone or<br>you can use a headset to minimize<br>the background noise if you're using a<br>desktop<br>you'll need to have a webcam microphone<br>or notepad as well<br>and most importantly you'll need a<br>the second thing to pay attention to is<br>your paper outlines<br>and these are really important they're<br>your map<br>for your use throughout each of your<br>courses so make sure that you take the<br>time to read through those very<br>carefully<br>managing your time involves being on<br>time for scheduled classes and<br>activities<br>and most of these will take place for<br>you online managing multiple assessments<br>within a similar time frame<br>and allowing plenty of time to ask<br>questions and receive answers before a<br>piece of work is due<br>in order to manage your time properly<br>you'll need to minimize the distractions<br>around you<br>and i'm sure lots of students can<br>identify things that prevent them from<br>concentrating<br>or participating in these studies so try<br>your best to remove these<br>for example you might find it useful to<br>close the relevant tabs on your computer<br>leave your phone in another room or turn<br>it off or tell your friends or family<br>that you're unavailable for the next few<br>hours while you focus<br>connecting with your classmates is also<br>really important when you're in an<br>online environment<br>you don't get to see each other face to<br>face so your only opportunity<br>to interact is online but this is also a<br>really useful thing to do<br>because you can get to know each other<br>ask each other for help<br>create online study groups or develop<br>social time you hang out together<br>virtually and watch a movie<br>asking questions is also really<br>important in an online environment<br>if you require help or further<br>explanation on something please ask<br>questions<br>use the online tools such as zoom chat<br>function moodle messaging<br>or moodle forums to ask your questions<br>and lastly take breaks it can be really<br>difficult to spend a lot of time in<br>front of a screen<br>let alone concentrate on the subject<br>it's really important that you take<br>breaks<br>so this infographic provides some detail<br>around some online etiquette for<br>studying online<br>especially relating to zoom sessions and<br>live sessions<br>so here you can see that it's really<br>important that you log in using your<br>student id in full name so that your<br>teacher knows exactly who you are<br>you should dress as you normally would<br>for a university class so avoid turning<br>up in your pajamas<br>arrive on time and be prepared sit in a<br>well-lit<br>space with a neutral background so<br>you're easily seen<br>use a headset if you have a lot of<br>external noise around you<br>close other applications and minimize<br>distractions<br>mute your mic when you're not speaking<br>and you can turn your camera on and off<br>as you need to there's also a raise your<br>hand function on zoom which lets your<br>teacher know that you have a question or<br>you'd like to talk<br>and the chat function on zoom is really<br>useful for asking questions<br>silently we do ask that you do not<br>record or share sessions without the<br>permission of the teacher and other<br>students<br>but also be patient and respectful<br>towards everybody<br>as we navigate this online learning<br>environment so now melanie will take you<br>which is maori for hello family<br>so my name is melanie and i am a student<br>advisor<br>working with both international and<br>domestic students in the cafe<br>program so i'm the one that you come to<br>when you have queries or questions<br>and i am a one person problem solving<br>shop<br>so together we will celebrate your<br>success<br>and so many challenges that may come<br>along<br>and i will make contact with each of you<br>over the next week or so<br>so that you get to know me<br>and you'll know what i look like to do<br>my base<br>so let's have a look at the expectations<br>so<br>just as we as a staff are committed to<br>helping you achieve your goals<br>there's a couple of things that you need<br>to take on board<br>um as well and when we talk about<br>attendance and participation they are<br>equally important<br>so research shows that students who<br>attend every class who submit<br>each piece of assessment and who<br>participate<br>that means by asking questions showing<br>up to zoom sessions<br>past paper which is what we're all about<br>so your learning is not a passive<br>activity this means<br>that you we encourage you to be involved<br>with your learning<br>so ask questions if you are unsure about<br>anything<br>ask away so you must be self-directed<br>and i'll talk a bit more about that in<br>the university as a whole that's the<br>staff and all the students<br>are committed to the concept of academic<br>integrity<br>which means that in all our dealings<br>with each other<br>we have to do it with honesty and<br>ethically<br>this applies also to your behaviour so<br>if you click on the code of student<br>conduct you'll see the policy that the<br>university has<br>for the expected student behavior<br>and what might happen if the student<br>doesn't behave in a particular way<br>okay so everything<br>on that slide so let's look at workload<br>so with workload you should have a<br>maximum of 17 hours<br>a week face to face if you're doing four<br>papers<br>so each paper is four hours contact<br>four times four is 16 not 49 like<br>someone told me<br>yesterday not doing math so<br>it's 16 plus it could be a step academy<br>now<br>and then on top of that you've got 20<br>hours research<br>or for self-directed study which<br>includes research<br>reading any activities that you have to<br>do in your papers<br>so each assessment is graded<br>individually and over the semester<br>those grades accumulate or accrue or add<br>together<br>to give you your final paper total at<br>the end of the semester<br>we can talk about that through the<br>semester it's<br>really clear and you can say when you<br>get to 50 you know you pass the paper<br>okay so just a reminder that your<br>timetable on my white keto<br>will only show your ventures so make<br>sure that your timetable<br>which actually will discuss the study<br>skills<br>in the first week you'll create your own<br>timetable whether you do it with an app<br>or google<br>calendar or print it out<br>which we need to talk about make sure<br>okay if you look at your timetable you<br>don't have 16 hours you're missing<br>something<br>and come and talk to melanie she'll help<br>you find your lost house<br>i'll we'll do a zoom okay<br>student support so i'm a student advisor<br>so it's a little bit different with you<br>being offshore<br>probably the college will be your first<br>port of call<br>but student learning is available so<br>student learning will provide academic<br>support<br>in any subject across the campus<br>yeah and career services they provide<br>workshops<br>and drop-ins it's going to be a bit<br>different for you<br>unless it's a zoom drop-in um you know<br>on careers in the future<br>accessibility that's also a bit<br>challenging but we can deal with<br>anything the one stop<br>help yeah we're the ones problem solving<br>um but i think the main thing that you<br>need to know is just because you're<br>offshore doesn't mean that we're not<br>here<br>to help you every inch of the way<br>so now we're going to talk to a couple<br>come in<br>so i'm just going to introduce you to<br>them and then i'm going to hand it over<br>to you<br>so which one you should go first i'll<br>leave you first<br>so she's starting her career on monday<br>so i'll leave it to you logan<br>so logan yeah what would be the big<br>thing one of the big things that you did<br>in foundation i think i choose the<br>english<br>bitterness for my bachelorette and some<br>other<br>like critical thinking that's really<br>good<br>i think the business<br>is is pretty interesting i like it<br>because<br>um at the end of the sem semester we<br>have<br>really crazy ideas to do with teacher<br>visual teacher<br>our idea and how does it work is<br>and we in critical thinking<br>we talk about the argument skill<br>finances it help i think that's really<br>useful for me when i talk when we have a<br>discussion with my friends<br>we can find some issue or we can have<br>users<br>feel to show our opinions that's really<br>interesting yeah do you win arguments<br>sometimes because my friends are creepy<br>crazy friends that's what we were crazy<br>yeah and that's why we're friends<br>what about you richard so you're coming<br>towards the latter half of your<br>engineering degree<br>yes so cutters like long memory for me<br>yeah<br>well i gotta say like i think the<br>most thing i learned from the cabbage<br>which is very easy my future<br>study is like the the habits of<br>attending all the lectures<br>because in the capital there's a<br>assessment of<br>tendencies which is 10 for each papers<br>it's not only an easy much money to get<br>but also will stimulate a very good<br>habits that will make you<br>go to the other lectures labs and the<br>workshops<br>and with time goes by you'll get used to<br>not missing any lectures<br>well in the future studies<br>attending actress is not compulsory<br>so some of friends just be lazy<br>they ignore the morning lectures or<br>they don't ignore the lectures when they<br>are very tired<br>which is not very good for the study so<br>i think the<br>tendencies in the inner cups is<br>most useful things for the future<br>studies so<br>richard did you mention this morning<br>that you had a friend that had only<br>attended<br>yeah one of my friends in the first year<br>of the bachelor well my friends just<br>attended<br>three or four lectures for the entire<br>semester<br>so that year i really felt like seven or<br>eight papers so there you go<br>yeah it's all it's very cost of money<br>it's true so logan what would be your<br>trip to<br>to the new students starting<br>would you have a tip for them like a uh<br>a hint or a bit of advice for them uh<br>i think the first advice i will give you<br>guys is<br>my plan because i use your calendar<br>because in the first semester i didn't<br>use it and<br>in the last week of the semester i feel<br>really really surprised<br>i have so much work to do at the weekend<br>i gonna cry and in the second<br>year i need the<br>second semester uh i use the calendar<br>and i do my<br>work i relax take a break and do another<br>work<br>that's really good and at the moment i<br>was doing my<br>work and my friend texted me she said<br>look what you doing i was doing my work<br>i didn't say anything but a few days<br>later she attacked me again she said<br>make a plan yeah yeah<br>and i think don't be shy this is really<br>important as well<br>if you have any questions just ask your<br>friend or teacher actually you can<br>make friends with your teacher and<br>practice your english<br>to many internal international students<br>and to many chinese students<br>i have another advices<br>please don't just make friends with<br>chinese<br>you need to practice in your english<br>it's really really<br>important and<br>you can share your culture with<br>different people and you learn a lot of<br>different things that you can't<br>learn from your chinese from your<br>chinese brand<br>thank you what about you richard what<br>would be your tip<br>well probably the same<br>thing uh first like<br>uh be organized organize your study<br>your time uh make sure you get enough<br>rest<br>make sure you get enough studies and<br>go to the gym yeah of course<br>cars well<br>sometimes because i gotta do something<br>the<br>rest take the break break with the break<br>from the stressful<br>studies well and also<br>be disciplined because like people<br>always saying the<br>biggest enemy is yourself you have to<br>beat your lazy<br>oh conquer the lady under the world is<br>full of the distraction<br>you have to concentrate on your studies<br>that's that's that's what i'm saying the<br>discipline and also<br>a tendency to catch up all the lectures<br>so these are two examples of<br>two committed hard-working<br>well-organized<br>students who have participated in the<br>course<br>and now they're taking part in the final<br>discussion so<br>maybe you could do the same thing so<br>well done youtube<br>so these are your priorities for<br>right now so there's an um<br>i'm not sure so i'm not really sure what<br>is available<br>offshore but if you can go to your play<br>store and<br>find the on your phone and find the<br>waiketo app<br>uni app which i did this morning but i'm<br>an enthusiast<br>it's got heaps of stuff on it so it is<br>worth<br>downloading if you can because it will<br>keep you in the loop<br>of what's what we're doing over here um<br>check your username and password that's<br>really important<br>you'll need to put it on every piece of<br>work that you do<br>with your textbooks i know some of you<br>have been having problems<br>accessing them if you've got any<br>problems with those i would<br>email pathways wikito.ac.nz<br>um once you have access to moodle check<br>your timetable and like roxy said<br>earlier on<br>technology is going to be your savior or<br>your<br>not savior you really need to make sure<br>that you've got good technology<br>so i look forward to meeting you over<br>so now is the time that we had set aside<br>to answer any questions that you may<br>have<br>at the moment we haven't had any<br>questions pop up<br>so if you've got any questions you can<br>see at the bottom of your screen there<br>that you can ask a question in the q a<br>and we'll do our best to answer that for<br>you<br>if you don't have any questions at the<br>moment that's just fine too<br>we're really happy to take questions<br>whenever they occur to you<br>so if you think of something after you<br>finish watching the presentation<br>and you'd like to ask please feel free<br>to get in touch with any one of us<br>so one of the contacts melanie's just<br>told you about is an email address<br>whitecontrol.ac.nz please feel free to<br>email your questions<br>there and we'll answer them or to any<br>one of your tutors that you may already<br>have contact with<br>very happy to help with anything at all<br>okay it looks like we may have a<br>really good question thank you for that<br>where and when do you buy<br>textbooks can someone answer that yeah<br>the best<br>thing to do is again email pathways at<br>waikido and so we will be able to give<br>you information<br>about your individual textbooks some of<br>you will have ebooks which will be make<br>it easy for you because you can access<br>them online<br>and some of you will be able to access<br>the text through the university of<br>waikato<br>library so we will be looking at that in<br>the first week of study skills in terms<br>of making sure that you have everything<br>you need for your course<br>but if you would like to know sooner<br>than next week then email sally at<br>uh how can you connect good question um<br>yeah<br>so you can email sorry you can message<br>directly through moodle and so the<br>moodle pages will be open on monday<br>for all of your papers so jump onto<br>moodle and have a look actually it's a<br>good idea anyway in terms of looking at<br>the information for the first week of<br>your classes you can<br>message your lecturer or tutors through<br>there you can also message<br>other classmates and many of your papers<br>there will be group work so that's an<br>opportunity for you to<br>work with other people in your paper uh<br>and there'll be q a forums and other<br>discussion forums on moodle as well<br>so basically noodle is the place where<br>we sort of<br>can even for all students actually in<br>terms of connecting with each other<br>either in a social kind of environment<br>environment it shows your way<br>or with regard to your academic studies<br>last semester we had quite a few<br>students that connected<br>um through moodle and we'll watch movies<br>together someone would share their<br>screen on zoom<br>um and that was a pretty cool thing as<br>well so you're not on your own just<br>because you're studying at home<br>in the online environment uh you'll meet<br>heaps of people<br>including us and we're looking forward<br>to seeing<br>moodle probably sounds quite mysterious<br>at this point<br>so it's a it's a software it's a place<br>that you'll go<br>and that's going to become a much more<br>um<br>regular for you what we'll do is give<br>you information about how to find it<br>where to go to log on and what you might<br>see when you get there<br>and again if you have any trouble at all<br>what we'll do is we will<br>you can let us know and we'll help you<br>step by step<br>and we've got a lecture in the first<br>week of study skills about how to use<br>moodle<br>so make sure you watch that one very<br>important yeah<br>questions<br>okay not today well get in touch with us<br>if you do we're happy to help talk to<br>you about anything you need to know to<br>be able to complete your studies<br>so what you need to do who you need to<br>speak to<br>what kind of things will help
