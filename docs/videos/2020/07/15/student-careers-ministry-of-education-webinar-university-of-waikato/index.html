your role your Papa<br>when you join the Ministry of Education<br>and why it's a great place to work so<br>we'll start off with Jackson Otto thank<br>you may my name is Jackson and I work as<br>a source of installation advisor at the<br>Ministry of Education I've been here for<br>the last year and a half having formerly<br>coming as an NT as well my about my<br> pop I beg to Nelson<br>I'm originally from the grew up there<br>and moved to Wellington just over years<br>ago now which is crazy and the last<br>question was why is the most sure great<br>place to work um the opportunities that<br>I've been given since they're coming in<br>as an ending as being awesome I got to<br>start um yeah back in 2018 and I've been<br>studying since through till just a<br>couple weeks ago actually and been<br>really good with providing me with like<br>a part time opportunities while I've<br>been studying in and out into the full<br>time and also the sorts of work I've<br>been able to get involved and so<br>obviously I'm an HR but most of my role<br>has been actually to look after summer<br>internship now so I was quite heavily<br>involved with with getting Mays cohort<br>on board and now it's May and I leading<br>and the next cohort so yes it that's<br>probably why I think to get close with<br>thanks Jackson everyone my name<br>is Easter and I am the lead advisor for<br>policy capability at the ministry so<br>what that basically means is I run the<br>ministry's policy graduate program I'm<br>originally from Luverne and I studied at<br>Massey University in Palmerston North I<br>moved to Wellington six years ago and<br>I've been working at the ministry since<br>November 2016 I think fish why I think<br>the military is a great place to work is<br>quite similar to Jackson's actually the<br>opportunities that you get when you work<br>here are amazing I've meant to work in<br>three or four different teams in my time<br>here and I've been able to work with<br>some really amazing people and had some<br>great experiences so that would be why I<br>recommend the ministry I will pass to<br>Elliott if you could introduce<br>yourselves killed Oh<br>so I'm Elliott Jones and I am now a<br>policy analyst at the Ministry of<br>Education I grew up in Auckland and I<br>moved to Wellington when I started the<br>grad policy program in January of last<br>year and I think the ministry is a great<br>place to work because you get to work<br>with an amazing group of people who are<br>all who are all doing great work in<br>trying to make a difference so that's<br>why I enjoy coming to work every day and<br>other things awesome Thank You Elliot<br>and we've got a few staff members who<br>were running late they're trying to get<br>through the link but what reduce<br>themselves after yeah but yeah I think<br>we're just going to get into it so<br>pretty much today we're just going to<br>give you an overview of our summer<br>internship Oh grad graduate policy<br>program and then yeah and then we'll<br>just go through any other questions that<br>you guys may have so I'm just gonna get<br>give it a stir<br>to go through our graduate policy<br>program and please feel free to send<br>through some misses any questions that<br>cool thanks May<br>Soyuz is amazing I'm here to talk about<br>the graduate program so just a quick few<br>points about it it's a permanent<br>position with the ministry and the first<br>eighteen months are a development<br>program it's based here in Wellington at<br>our national office and it starts in<br>January next year the program is made up<br>of two nine months rotations so you get<br>to work in two different policy teams<br>and at the end of the eighteen months<br>you're given the opportunity to be<br>promoted to policy analysts which<br>Elliott has just gone through I will<br>just touch on a little bit of the teams<br>that we have that work here so the<br>ministry has and also kind of the type<br>of work that you'll be involved with and<br>I'll also ask Elliot to just go into a<br>bit of detail about the work that he did<br>over his graduate program so broadly you<br>can expect to work on analysis of data<br>doing research and providing advice to<br>the government of the day we have an<br>extensive policy community and we have<br>teams that look at early childhood<br>education Pacific education all the way<br>through to infrastructure school<br>transport and tertiary education so<br>there's a whole variety that you could<br>be involved with and your work program<br>is largely dependent on the government<br>of the day so with an election year<br>coming up this year it's going to be<br>quite interesting to see how that<br>changes the ministries work priorities<br>and but Elliot if you just want to touch<br>on some of the work that you've been<br>involved with over the last 18 months<br>yeah absolutely and so when I joined the<br>ministry I started off in education<br>infrastructure services which basically<br>is the part of the ministry that looks<br>after the vast amount of school property<br>that the ministry has because there are<br>2,100 state state schools and so I got<br>to do some really interesting work in<br>their team including figuring out how to<br>spin how to allocate ninety five million<br>dollars that we that the government had<br>given us to do<br>particular thing and then I am currently<br>finishing up in the Maori policy team<br>which has been a great experience and<br>I've been working primarily on the<br>refresh of our kahikatea and tomorrow<br>which are our strategies for Maori<br>education and for Maddie language and<br>education and that's been really<br>different piece of work to beyond so<br>I've had two very different<br>opportunities throughout the great<br>program Thanks so now I'll just quickly<br>go over the application process the<br>application process is run by an<br>external recruitment company called ocg<br>and it's the website that you need to go<br>to to apply for our program it has<br>various stages which you go through but<br>the first is just putting your online<br>application and

system you can still apply<br>to so please apply yeah so right now<br>we're just going to hand it over to<br>Jackson he's going to go for an overview<br>of a summer internship and then we'll go<br>from there awesome Kilda thanks May<br>um I might just give Jane the<br>kanna's how so yes I've just joined you<br>a little bit later but my name is Jane<br>song I did a Bachelor of teaching and<br>early childhood at the University of<br>Waikato and then I moved to Wellington<br>did a bit of law at Victoria and had the<br>opportunity to join the ministry as a<br>summon summer intern this summer just<br>passed with me and a whole bunch of<br>others it's been a really awesome<br>experience and clearly I've stayed I've<br>stayed in the team that I was in for the<br>internship and yeah I've been working<br>all through lockdown and up until now<br>I'm mainly involved in NCEA we are<br>setting up some new literacy numeracy<br>requirements so most of my work is based<br>around that yeah I'm here to you know<br>support and if there's any questions you<br>have about the experience and<br>applications absolutely put them in the<br>chat and yeah please don't lie because<br>thanks Chang<br>so yeah this is just the slide here<br>gives you a bit of an overview of where<br>we've been and where we're going for<br>this year so we're actually only coming<br>into our third year of the summer<br>internship so relatively new I was part<br>of the first cohort and 2018-19 where I<br>had a living fellow interns and with a<br>spread across six business groups or<br>teams um the year just been the summer<br>just beans between 19 and 20 summer we<br>had slightly more interns across the<br>same amount of teams and yeah we<br>actually have quite a good number of<br>those that do complete the internship<br>move on to post internship opportunities<br>there's something that we that we do<br>promote we don't guarantee but um as you<br>can see there's quite a number they're<br>either stay on with the ministry or find<br>opportunities elsewhere and the<br>flexibility of the opportunities as well<br>has been one I've really cherished now<br>transition full-time so<br>like I said we're going into our third<br>year and some key information in terms<br>of what what's needed to apply I'm the<br>only two real prerequisites we have is<br>that you must be any citizen or resident<br>and you have math you must have<br>completed at least two years of teaching<br>study see our applications are opening<br>this Sunday and they are only going to<br>be open for a couple weeks<br>yeah like Mason you have to get in quite<br>quick in terms of how we source our<br>interns we partner with two Bataille<br>into the tour and also they go out<br>directly ourselves so to retire RA in be<br>their support pathways into policy for<br>Pacific students I believe the<br>applications are still open and then we<br>also partner with toobut or whose<br>applications have just closed but<br>they've placed Molly and Pacific<br>students across Altidore into private<br>and public organizations and so yes a<br>bit for the secret for our second year<br>serve last year we actually tried out<br>direct sourcing as well for the first<br>time because a micro walk we partnered<br>to return to retire and also partner<br>with some of those intimate eegh so that<br>was all outsourced the recruitment but<br>this last year and again this year and<br>we'll be going out directly ourselves<br>and that's what the applications will be<br>for and come the 19th of July so through<br>the direct sourcing channel it's a<br>four-step process similar in terms of<br>its makeup as to what you'd see from<br>intern and graduate recruitment in terms<br>of there being an initial step where<br>you're asked to provide a CV and cover<br>letter as well as answer some screen<br>questions and then there's a second step<br>that we haven't fully determined on you<br>but it's going to be a test of some<br>variety and then the third step would be<br>a video interview in the fourth step in<br>assessment they couldn't very well leave<br>virtual<br>considering the environment we're<br>operating in the UM so the thing that<br>we're looking for in terms of an<br>application there's no prerequisite in<br>terms of GPA there's no expectation that<br>you must be studying us<br>so it's broad in that sense and what<br>we're more looking for is for you to<br>demonstrate what makes you uniquely you<br>through the answers that you provided<br>the questions to the screening questions<br>through your CV through your cover<br>letter really demonstrate to us what<br>we're looking for is for you to<br>demonstrate to us your passions your<br>interests your background your culture<br>and everything that makes you you<br>because that's something that we value<br>as is everybody's individual experience<br>and everybody's individuality in general<br>um so you'll see little things<br>throughout the process that are try and<br>draw that sort of stuff out of you<br>whether it's in the way that we frame<br>the questions whether it's best that's<br>in the way that we communicate with you<br>after applying or during the process<br>we're always sort of trying to because<br>because there's sort of like I feel like<br>an me miss miss perception of what a<br>recruitment and process can be like that<br>we're not trying to catch you out we're<br>trying to empower you to be able to<br>demonstrate the best version of yourself<br>throughout the process so I'm hopefully<br>you know through the questions that we<br>asked you give another chance to do that<br>and I encourage you right from the<br>get-go to kind of put it all out there<br>in terms of your motivations your your<br>background your culture and it's things<br>that make you - um see I'm excited for<br>the for the drink sourcing round last<br>year we had some good feedback and we<br>want to integrate to this year's process<br>and that's why we haven't fully just<br>hung on this you can step but yeah so<br>the Sundays when they're going to be<br>opening Jane you went through the direct<br>sourcing wrote do you want to maybe just<br>touched on your experience with you sure<br>I mean basically what there we go much<br>better<br>yeah so basically what Jackson said you<br>know it's a multiple step process and a<br>lot of it is you're probably expecting<br>it to be the case it's pretty standard I<br>think the key thing is to yet to really<br>show through who you are and the things<br>that you're passionate about because<br>like Jackson said the ministry is<br>looking for a really diverse range of<br>people there actually isn't a you know a<br>cookie cutter type of intern that<br>they're looking for so it could be you<br>why not you right so yeah absolutely<br>talk about the things that you're<br>interested in even if it's not<br>necessarily related to your studies per<br>se yeah and as you go through I don't<br>know I think you just kind of take it as<br>it comes it can be nerve-wracking but<br>they you know Jackson's team are here to<br>like support you if you've got questions<br>if you've got any concerns about<br>accessibility all those sorts of things<br>are absolutely I would like go for it<br>and yeah you get to know some really<br>cool people and so um just these are<br>some of the things we got up to as an<br>internship cohosh it we've made a few of<br>the ministers the interns did a bit of<br>an Instagram tato which is pretty cool<br>but in terms of the things that they do<br>within their teams I think I'd be best<br>place to let Mae and change talk about<br>their experience in teams and what they<br>got up to that it's across the ministry<br>the internships the roles could be<br>anywhere from HR to curriculum design<br>Tech Community Engagement business<br>services yes so it's open to to the<br>whole ministry and so you can see quite<br>a variety of positions and once you get<br>into the ministry you start to see<br>actually you know the breadth of work<br>that we to do and the opportunities that<br>there are yeah so yeah I'll pass it on<br>to just add to that point and just<br>Farwest out over applications like<br>Jackson said the the roles are really<br>varied that you could go into we had<br>lots of different interns and lots of<br>different business groups doing lots of<br>different things so if you have you know<br>particular interests or if you have<br>particular skills that you'd like to be<br>using absolutely indicate that so they<br>know when they sort out who's going<br>where<br>so if you're you know if you're really<br>strong and writing absolutely do that if<br>you want something that is<br>you know community facing they will pro<br>and accommodate that but they can't do<br>that unless you know so absolutely like<br>make sure you know you really express<br>what you're keen on doing and what you<br>awesome Thank You Jane what I'm gonna do<br>now I'm just going to go through and<br>plug in some questions that wok actually<br>answer all of what you guys want to hear<br>more from us so because I was an intern<br>in the summer I'm going to talk to so<br>and when I get some of the questions I<br>want to pull out is just regarding the<br>summer internship while we're still<br>talking about it<br>is for to say the road that we did what<br>we did during the summer what the<br>12-week look like and just advice that<br>you'll give them once you know what they<br>tell week will look like in terms of<br>workload what you know relationships of<br>your managers and like the ministry as a<br>whole so I'll give it up to Jane I mean<br>she'll just go through those questions<br>you might have to just give me a bit of<br>a prompt so so the team that I was<br>placed into it was Elsa which stands for<br>early learning and student achievement<br>and then within that business group<br>secondary tertiary and then within that<br>this is another group my immediate team<br>which is called pathways and transitions<br>and don't worry about the group knows<br>you will figure out who does what and<br>what your role is but basically yeah we<br>cover a lot of senior secondary there's<br>a big review going on of NZ at the<br>moment it's like a huge five-year<br>project and I got to be involved with<br>the literacy numeracy side of it we're<br>still very early in the early stages and<br>that's what I've been working on ever<br>since I got to the ministry but yeah<br>it's been really really cool throughout<br>the internship you do get opportunities<br>to try out a lot of different things it<br>depends what your team is doing what<br>kind of projects you are doing but there<br>is flexibility to say oh this looks<br>really awesome I'd like to have a go at<br>that or can I find out more about this<br>yeah so a lot of my work was setting up<br>these hours processes and our planning<br>for literacy and numeracy thinking about<br>what we need to be thinking about as we<br>do this work<br>but whether my team as well we've got<br>people working on the school leavers<br>toolkit which was a initiative that was<br>launched last year last year we've got<br>people working on vocational education<br>like pathways and to vocational<br>education there's a lot of different<br>things going on so it was really cool to<br>be able to see all that and to be able<br>to try some of that out and one thing<br>I'll say is like my experience was that<br>they you know treat you like you are<br>competent you know they recognize that<br>you can actually do things and he has<br>things to say and you have a perspective<br>so that was something that was a<br>highlight for me personally to be really<br>trusted to do the work you know they<br>don't make up fake tasks where you do<br>actually get to do the real work that is<br>happening and really get involved so<br>that was really awesome<br>another highlight for me was the other<br>relationships and the connections we had<br>a really fun group of interns we spent a<br>lot of time together just getting to<br>know each other and supporting each<br>other throughout this whole process<br>because it can be quite intimidating so<br>it's nice to have people go along with<br>you and who get what you're going<br>through and who understand that but also<br>within the ministry as well people are<br>really open to speaking with you and<br>telling you you know what sort of work<br>that they do<br>so absolutely I would encourage you once<br>you get the opportunity to to you know<br>go and talk to lots of people and find<br>out what's going on and you never know<br>the connections that you might make<br>there so yeah<br>thanks Jane I'll just because of my<br>experience I'm so Jackson touched on the<br>sourcing I'm channels that I'm Yuqing<br>country to be an intern here ministry so<br>I was one of five who came through to<br>put soil so Twitter is a Modi and<br>Pacific group so they help and get us<br>interns into the private and public<br>sector so yeah I was pleased took and<br>get placed in the Minister of Education<br>now I always had this story and I think<br>these guys are probably selling over I<br>remember when I was placed in the<br>Minister of Education I for myself I was<br>like it wasn't an area I thought I would<br>be in but like I mentioned early on the<br>policy graduate it doesn't matter what<br>background you come from you need to<br>still apply and get into the places and<br>really grow in that place so for me I<br>was placed in the business services team<br>and I doubt with I'm sustainability um<br>so for me during my time here at the<br>ministry during my internship I am<br>helped to measure the emissions for the<br>ministry from July until the end of the<br>year I mean that was my project from the<br>beginning until the answer that was like<br>a big project that I had and they'll<br>always be like little things on the side<br>that I could do um and for me I learned<br>so much in that like I one thing that I<br>did taken was to be open minded ready to<br>learn I'm at the same time and actually<br>not be myself up if you know I sometimes<br>you think that you're not doing enough<br>but the thing is it's all about learning<br>even everywhere you go you're learning<br>new things and even today you sitting<br>here you're learning more so that's<br>something that I took in with me and<br>while I was in the role there was 12<br>weeks so topics is pretty much a long<br>time that's three months and I actually<br>was really interested in breaking in the<br>people capability team which is a HR and<br>I really want to Jackson<br>roll But Here I am I am back in the in<br>the ministry and I'm working alongside<br>Dixon so it's awesome<br>at the same time cuz you need to put<br>yourself out there when you're yeah like<br>when you're in you gotta go all out<br>especially laughs for all of us who were<br>early in career like um you know the<br>times that were and now you just got to<br>present yourself be resilient and be<br>yourself I just won the quote what<br>Jackson said earlier he was like the<br>ministry helps empower you to<br>demonstrate the best version of yourself<br>and I believe that wholeheartedly<br>because there's so many opportunities<br>that are here and that's how I still go<br>around here's well with no working it<br>for different teams in they do really<br>help you grow in this area my highlights<br>Jana really mentioned all of them we had<br>an awesome support system here we did<br>have so once you become an intern you<br>get a mentor a manager and a buddy so<br>this system so your buddy would be like<br>your end for more yeah it'll be like you<br>know you can go for lunches and have a<br>kennel chat with them and then you'll<br>mean to another won't be here supporting<br>you for your role and obviously your<br>manager you report to most of time in<br>terms of if you're not coming in because<br>you're sick yeah so that's the support<br>system that we had but we also had<br>Jackson and and Lillian our manager they<br>helped us free Autoweek and program in<br>terms of growth we did grow it so much<br>as a cohort and because we're allowed to<br>Job Shadow some of the roles that we<br>looked that looked interesting and some<br>of the things that we did Xu I want to<br>pursue after so I was able to do there<br>and I'm yeah I learned so much from it<br>so yeah I think that's all from me um<br>and my experience and what the topic<br>program looked like and how we came into<br>the Ministry of Education<br>we're just gonna head into oh oh did you<br>have anything it today not really I<br>think I think we covered I think I'm one<br>thing that I yeah also like to make sure<br>there's<br>I really didn't I did a teaching degree<br>oh I cut ashore but I really didn't know<br>what the ministry did before coming here<br>to be honest and it is such a large<br>place there are so many different<br>projects going on so I just want to say<br>like don't be freaked out and just like<br>a play anyway even if you don't know<br>that you don't have to be an expert no<br>one that's expecting that from you<br>I think the real key thing especially<br>for all of us who are you know just<br>leaving uni and earlier in our careers<br>like May said is that attitude of like<br>being prepared to learn because anywhere<br>you go you're gonna have to learn<br>something new you know you're not gonna<br>show up fully form to any entry level<br>job<br>so yeah just it's okay if you don't know<br>if you if it's all seems like<br>intimidating or yeah confusing just yeah<br>apply come through and then you will<br>have the time to learn and there will be<br>people to support you yeah thank you<br>Jane I'm awesome we're just going to go<br>into our Q&amp;A our questions I do have a<br>few questions that I've written out for<br>myself myself I do have a question for<br>Elliot<br>so are you able to tell us like the<br>process that you went through in terms<br>of a you know applying for the grad role<br>and also tell us like what I'm advice<br>would you give I'm those who are<br>applying and then advise you'll give<br>yourself now to the Elliot they applied<br>earlier oh yeah super simple questions<br>thanks man<br>okay so the process I went through for<br>applying was kind of is still a doubt<br>and it might have changed slightly but<br>you know there is the the initial<br>application so your CV and kind of<br>talking about why you want to join the<br>ministry and then we had some assessment<br>throughout it so we had a written<br>assessment there was behavioral<br>assessments and in Skype interview and<br>then ended with a panel interview where<br>we got brought to the ministry so that<br>was the final step so that was process<br>the application and then it's a second<br>question what was my experience of the<br>application process yeah Coke's oh yeah<br>it's a very similar application process<br>to all the other ones you're going to go<br>through for some of those types of<br>things and you know it does have steps<br>and you my advice would be treat each<br>one has its own application you know you<br>need to you need to talk about why you<br>want that job and why you're passionate<br>about that job and you know I wanted to<br>work the Minister of Education because I<br>you know ideally I wanted to work in the<br>public sector and because I wanted to do<br>work that made a difference but the<br>mystery which occasion really appealed<br>to me because it's kind of central to<br>everything we all interact with it at<br>different points in our lives and so it<br>can have this great impact and then all<br>the real hard question of what advice<br>would I give to myself probably now two<br>years ago was probably when I was going<br>through application so my advice would<br>be you know if I look back it would<br>actually be about job hunting job<br>hunting in general and job hunting can<br>be really hard especially as you come<br>out of uni and just keep going and keep<br>telling your story and don't you know<br>you're not always going to get the job<br>you thought you're gonna get or you know<br>you're gonna get particularly renowned<br>there but it's not about you there are a<br>whole bunch of people out there who are<br>really great who are all going for these<br>jobs so don't take a bit too personally<br>and just keep going and keep telling<br>your story about why you who you are and<br>why you want these jobs and all happen<br>awesome thank you Elliot there was<br>awesome advice so we're just going to go<br>through the group share some questions<br>here so this is for Jackson and Easter<br>and I'll get you guys to answer this so<br>international students eligible to apply<br>we seem to I think all of or free of<br>as sort of a sign for the internship and<br>a great program so and all to be<br>eligible for the both programs you need<br>to have New Zealand residency or<br>citizenship just looking at Jackson<br>season summer as me to make sure that's<br>correct and it's nodding so it must be<br>and in terms of part-time roles the<br>graduate program is a full-time program<br>full-time position sorry but that<br>doesn't mean the ministry doesn't have<br>part-time options available and you can<br>check those out on our careers website<br>which will send a link round to everyone<br>that's come along today to see call<br>information but keep an eye on the<br>Ministry of Education z' careers website<br>and you can like register a profile and<br>set up your work preferences so when<br>jobs there are of interest to you and<br>maybe fit the criteria that you're<br>looking for are come available you'll<br>get seen to notification so have the<br>answers your question but justly either<br>myself or Jackson or may know if it<br>hasn't awesome yes so we don't have any<br>other questions in the group chat and<br>please feel free to send them through<br>now if you do you can just unmute your<br>microphone and you can just okay we got<br>one here what do you suggest for someone<br>who was interested in minister of<br>education but studied finance and<br>economics are there any positions for<br>this sector will go for Jackson a good<br>question good question with the Ministry<br>of Education we've got a mess of Finance<br>team so there's opportunities there<br>there either may pop up through the<br>summer internship but also will be<br>popping up ad hoc through our Career<br>Center also what I'd say about studying<br>finance and economics it doesn't<br>necessarily restrict you to those<br>professions I mean that would be an<br>applicable skill set to our one of our<br>largest business groups evidence that<br>our knowledge who do a lot of them they<br>do a lot of their data and analysis that<br>there helps to inform all the analytical<br>type of thinking that I'm sure you've<br>learned doing finance and economics<br>applies to etk as they analyze data and<br>provide<br>of information to inform policies and<br>and the education sector and things like<br>that but we do have large finance and<br>economic teams so there are<br>opportunities in their area and I would<br>still encourage you to apply for summer<br>internship because you never know you<br>might be placed in a team that actually<br>has a focus in that area and I wish I<br>could specify you know whether there<br>were particular teams then that I have<br>to take partaking in some internship<br>that I haven't they have finance and<br>economics specifically but I can't at<br>this point um but yeah I think cool I<br>will say also even in my role as an<br>advisor in secondary tertiary I'm having<br>to do some finance things yeah it's I<br>think definitely be open mind as long as<br>you are open to you know being in<br>different roles and doing lots of<br>different things definitely those skills<br>will be applicable to a lot of different<br>places that you go to and then if you're<br>looking for that kind of work<br>specifically that can come through in<br>different ways as well so yeah yeah even<br>in fire even an HR to be fair I mean and<br>if you want especially if you're looking<br>to to peruse through to a leadership<br>level budgets messed up don't budgets<br>that says got a leadership managerial<br>role so it's a huge part recording here<br>and just add what everyone else has just<br>ceded the graduate program the policy<br>community at the ministry has as I<br>mentioned before a huge variety of teens<br>some of which specialize in funding and<br>we do have a budget team specifically so<br>there's definitely areas of policy that<br>you can work in with those with that<br>background and economics is something<br>there is like awesome and it would<br>definitely apply to basically all of our<br>policy teams Elliott did some economics<br>papers so he is going to just talk about<br>that very quickly okay little more than<br>some papers I do have a degree in<br>economics sister so yeah it is<br>applicable but I think I'm kind of<br>reiterate what change is super for is<br>there whatever you study is you can<br>choose what you want and the skills<br>you've got from that finance he cannot<br>like the great schools to have and will<br>apply to the two you can apply that to<br>any of the work you go into so yeah<br>great things to have on policy and but<br>it doesn't mean that if you haven't done<br>finance and economics that you don't<br>have great schools to bring as well so<br>it's what do you want to do and it's you<br>know I've said to people that it's not<br>always about what I studied you need<br>about the skills I gained from not only<br>what I did at uni but what I did outside<br>awesome Thank You Elliot I will question<br>for Jason and mr. um what's the scam<br>revisits who find out more information<br>about the summer internship in the<br>graduate programs great question um what<br>I'm saying is there we've got quite a<br>few different avenues you could go<br>through to find more info so we've got<br>obviously our Career Center our<br>education Career Center you'll find the<br>tab it's his shin Chris and you'll find<br>information on the grad program and<br>internship another pathways somebody<br>early in their career then we also have<br>an extent page so you might not have<br>heard about next it but they're an<br>employer website<br>yeah and Mays gonna link next step in<br>the chair<br>thanks man and there gives lots of<br>information about those pathways as well<br>also I would say our social media pages<br>so quite active around this<br>a year without social media and nearly<br>and career stuff so we're more info<br>coming soon if you haven't seen it<br>already and then stay tuned also for a<br>grade in zip profile which is going to<br>be coming up and we're going to be<br>publishing net sometimes in the near<br>future which is another employer website<br>that you may have heard about so plenty<br>of places you can go is the link mister<br>thanks mister yeah thanks for the<br>question I I'm in a little question I'm<br>for Lee and Jane and what is the working<br>like flexibility at the Ministry of<br>Education like would you like to go<br>put my linebacker and yeah it's it is<br>fixable you know now that we all work<br>from home for two months during lockdown<br>and so we've all kind of we have the<br>ability to work for a moment if you want<br>to but also you know if you want to be<br>in the office and if you've got<br>appointments during the day you know<br>it's it's not you know you still have to<br>do the work and you have to like you<br>know coming to your job and but you know<br>when you prove yourself you got that<br>flexibility and so it's not you know<br>have to come in the office and be there<br>from 95 because I'm going to go do you<br>know during the work day but you know<br>you just have to manage it around all<br>the work you're doing yeah I would talk<br>about that um yeah it's one thing I<br>guess that surprised me as my team and<br>it kind of does vary from team to team<br>from managers they've all got different<br>styles and things but like the key<br>things as long as you're doing the work<br>there is a lot of flexibility you know<br>my team we've got we've got mums you<br>know single mums who work a little bit<br>you know not within City we've got<br>someone who's doing their masters at the<br>same time so you know there's<br>flexibility around that and even just in<br>the general a day to day like I remember<br>what I first came I was so shocked like<br>what I don't have to write timesheets<br>and even look like you can just like<br>your trusted to come in your trusted to<br>do that work your trusted to go on lunch<br>without you know having to tell someone<br>or you can go to the bathroom to tell<br>someone so that seats as well yeah yeah<br>there's a lot of there's a lot of<br>flexibility for sure and you know if<br>you've got individual circumstances<br>absolutely just bring it up and yeah<br>there people are very accommodating yeah<br>and the key thing is that you are you<br>know you're able to do the work and<br>contribute and keep in touch with<br>Thank You Jane I'm just looking here the<br>group chair<br>Ginny Richie that was my next question<br>so you're on a roll today<br>so yeah I'm today's a nest egg in other<br>roles solely in Wellington or are they<br>offered any other locations<br>I'll just go first so the graduate<br>program is based only in Wellington in<br>with the internship we have primarily<br>all of our interns placed in Layton but<br>last year we didn't have one guy in<br>Auckland honey um and there's a<br>possibility this year not it's not off<br>the table when to be fair all I will say<br>is that we were going to regionalize the<br>internship more but with Cogan we think<br>got thrown into a bit of a spin and so<br>priorities shifted and we've been<br>managed to have the conversations in<br>time but that would there's something<br>firmly on the road after the next<br>recruitment also Thank You Jackson is<br>this a year so it's in Wellington with<br>the internship there is like um yet to<br>be confirmed a if we do have any roles<br>out of different regions but honestly<br>come to Wellington it's the best place<br>to be and even its experience I we have<br>awesome cafes around here and we've got<br>a big ill so we're right next to the<br>Beehive so you know it's good to just<br>look out the window and just see what<br>your centres up suea<br>but yeah it's a great place to be if you<br>do have questions that part of the<br>process if you do get in we can't help<br>you or direct you to like where you<br>could stay like look you know we've got<br>heaps of avenues that we can direct you<br>to I'm in terms of accommodation before<br>we wrap up are there any last-minute<br>I'll give it freely seconds it looks<br>like everyone's got all the information<br>that they made it for today<br>just to close off tell us your story<br>when you are applying through both<br>programs be yourself bring everything<br>that you have take your time in a plane<br>I do not recommend you do it one hour<br>before the applications close I tend to<br>do that in the past like ages ago and<br>you know you already know what it would<br>look like you weren't getting to the<br>next step so a playa take some time out<br>into oestrus 3 we are interested in what<br>you have to bring and you know we<br>learned so much of ourselves through the<br>whole process and even if you'd like I<br>can tell you that one door walk close<br>and oh you know not exactly I'll be<br>ready<br>obviously not everyone will get in but<br>you know is one door closes another<br>opportunity opens up for you and it will<br>be the great opportunity for you so um<br>that's all I'm asked for today<br>what I'm gonna do is Oh Brooke or<br>Danielle do you guys have any questions<br>fine taking this for us I'm just gonna<br>I'm in a certain prayer and then I'm<br>they test for today um that's right oh<br>my sister my father's a local putting<br>there tonight so perfect I leave my cell<br>phone it's an idea with my no
