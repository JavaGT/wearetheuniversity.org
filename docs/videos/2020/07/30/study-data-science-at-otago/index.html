The University of Otago is one of the world’s leading universities. Experience it for yourself by studying Data Science at Otago: https://www.otago.ac.nz/subjects/dasc.html?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=subjects_playlist&utm_term=none&utm_content=none</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>today I met from the data science team<br>of the attacker so maybe you've heard of<br>a Netflix problem<br>Netflix have more movies and shows and<br>you can possibly have to watch in your<br>lifetime and even hope to search there<br>in your lifetime so what they do they<br>look through all the information they<br>have on all the hundreds and millions of<br>years and all the hundreds of thousands<br>of shows they have to come up with shows<br>they think you'll like to watch and it's<br>not just Netflix solving problems like<br>this using data second we know<br>communities and towns and cities collect<br>data on air quality and water pollution<br>and they want to know things like this<br>public health going to be affected on<br>business has also want to plan for the<br>future so they use data to track<br>customer set demand satisfaction what's<br>selling what's not selling and<br>professional sports teams<br>another example use data on player<br>performance to figure out what would be<br>the best team selection and also what<br>would be the best strategy for the game<br>so data science is at the heart of an<br>organization's decision making process<br>in fact anywhere you find out are you'll<br>find data science so data science for me<br>is that is the science of learning from<br>data and data science is something for<br>everyone so if you like communication<br>graphics visualization then data science<br>it's for you if you like programming and<br>getting getting a computer to do all the<br>hard work for you then you're like data<br>science if you're passionate about any<br>area which involves data then you want<br>to do data science and if you like<br>number crunching like I do then data<br>science is for you too data science at<br>Otago is unique it brings together the<br>best we've got information science<br>computer science and statistics and then<br>you get to combine it with another area<br>of study something you care about and<br>that'd be a mine or a second major in<br>the area for example you can almost do<br>anything so if you like commerce you can<br>do a commerce any commerce option you<br>can do computer science you can do<br>marine science we do public health<br>ministers just goes on<br>in first year there'll be five data<br>science papers to take our you get<br>introduction to information technology<br>and information systems you'll get your<br>hands dirty during practical data<br>science you'll learn how to program and<br>also get an introduction into statistics<br>and all this will give you plenty of<br>time to start working towards your minor<br>or second major that's all you have to<br>do get into data science well in fact<br>there's no official prerequisites for<br>data science but we strongly recommend<br>NCEA level 3 digital technologies and in<br>mathematics as being helpful for me what<br>more it's more important is the<br>unofficial prerequisite just just<br>implication about data if you want to go<br>out and get it got a lot up plant peg<br>play with it if you want to do something<br>with it then data Sciences for you and<br>if that sounds like you would love to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
