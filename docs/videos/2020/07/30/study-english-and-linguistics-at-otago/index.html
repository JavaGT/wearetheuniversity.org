one place<br>english and linguistics and we'll find<br>out about both of them today which means<br>you can get a lot of info because it's<br>two programs in three minutes<br>uh my name is dr hunter hatfield or just<br>hunter<br>and i am the head of program for english<br>and linguistics hi<br>i'm emer and i'm a phd student in the<br>english program in english and<br>linguistics<br>and i started my phd in 2017<br>and i'm in my last six months and so<br>why do english well for me english is<br>multidisciplinary i don't think of it as<br>its own um distinct subject because it<br>crosses over with so many subjects i<br>mean personally<br>i work yes within the english department<br>i also work in the irish and scottish<br>studies i also work in sociology i also<br>work<br>over with performance studies and so<br>they intermingle with all these so<br>there's a place for everybody to find<br>something in english it's not just for<br>people who are<br>creative but also for people who are<br>readers who just love to read<br>and there are so many different courses<br>um at an undergraduate level<br>you can look at controversial classics<br>and the remix which takes books like<br>emma and looks at them from a movie<br>perspective like the movie clueless<br>and you can do reading from minds which<br>is like the psychology of reading<br>you can do multiple creative writing<br>programs um<br>which run from first year second year<br>third year throughout<br>and all of these are very complementary<br>to<br>multiple disciplines within the the<br>university<br>and especially with linguistics<br>so hunter i spoke like why would you do<br>linguistics<br>does how do you get into english<br>literature and linguistics at otago<br>uh there's different paths since we're a<br>combined thing you can do both actually<br>at once<br>or you can just choose which path you<br>want on the linguistic side<br>um we're a small sort of we're a small<br>group uh just four or five are staff<br>and so there's two papers to get you<br>into it one is called languages of the<br>world which is<br>where you learn how language works it's<br>the foundation for everything you learn<br>about languages that you know really<br>well already or these to have heard of<br>from english to french to arabic to<br>swahili and a bunch of languages you<br>probably never have heard of<br>we also have one called languages no<br>it's called language brain and being<br>human<br>and that connects things to anthropology<br>and sociology neuroscience and such<br>on the english side there's again two<br>paths<br>one sort of more about writing and<br>communication it can be with<br>professional or creative<br>and the other is on literature so<br>actually<br>you teach into english literature<br>english 131<br>controversial classics how does that<br>work so<br>what would you be doing in your first<br>year if you chose english<br>well one of the papers that you could<br>choose is ingle 131 controversial<br>classics which i<br>teach in two and as a lecturer in<br>controversial classics i look at both<br>alan ginsberg and<br>sylvia plath so two lectures on both and<br>the aim of something like controversial<br>classics is to think about<br>a scholarship at the time that it is<br>published<br>and for ginsburg in the 1950s or 60s<br>think about it<br>um as the waves of social progress what<br>happened<br>to that text during second wave feminism<br>what happened to that text during queer<br>theory what's happening to that text<br>now and so a text is not static in the<br>world it moves as we do and<br>changes as we do and that's what<br>literature does it becomes a social<br>force that we can look at from<br>historical sociological and literary<br>theory<br>and so there's something for everyone<br>and there are also excellent first year<br>creative writing papers there's one two<br>oh um<br>which and then there's also writing for<br>the professions and communication<br>multiples depending on what kind of<br>writing that you like or<br>perhaps you also want to take a creative<br>writing paper as a way<br>to better understand reading and which<br>is something that i definitely would<br>encourage like testing out a creative<br>writing paper<br>to understand how something is written<br>better rather than actually seeking to<br>be a creative writer yourself<br>so okay that sounds really nice about<br>the the way you teach the class<br>we talked about two different paths of<br>writing and<br>um literary study but actually you can<br>do them both because isn't your phd both<br>critical<br>and creative um<br>and so yes i do a creative critical phd<br>which means that half of my phd is the<br>creation of a poetry collection<br>and half of it is looking at lesbian<br>poetry and manifestations of shame in<br>new zealand and ireland<br>and so as a process of that yes have<br>i've created a one-woman show<br>i've performed multiple poetry<br>at poetry readings i also regularly<br>publish<br>online and also regularly publish<br>journal articles to<br>the critical side of the phd and so you<br>get to mix in both<br>those worlds and the thing about doing a<br>creative critical is that you really<br>need the support of a good department or<br>it's not going to work<br>because it's not the standard way to do<br>a phd<br>or to do a degree and some people will<br>undervalue it<br>but the fact is that these have extreme<br>values you are opening yourself up to<br>the world of the arts<br>as well as the world of academia a<br>critical and creative enterprise in your<br>mind that can only seek to further<br>the kinds of jobs that you can get<br>because you're the kind of experience<br>you will have will be<br>all consuming and then so what can you<br>do with it<br>right so with uh linguistics it's<br>actually in some ways very similar to<br>literary study and<br>writing and that what you do with it is<br>understand the world better<br>it's you know foundational to all of<br>life<br>and so it's nice to actually understand<br>a little bit more about that<br>um more broadly speaking of course you<br>get lots of skills and scholarship and<br>research and analysis and communication<br>so probably the most common thing is<br>people build their own life<br>learning how to do things in the world<br>more immediately the most common job for<br>linguistics afterwards people want to<br>travel the world<br>they take our classes and teach in<br>english as a whole tesol minor<br>they do those classes go off travel the<br>world for a few years and get paid for<br>it rather than having to pay<br>and that's always nice beyond that<br>people move into<br>issues mucho rangamori and stuff like<br>that<br>and also there's a health sciences side<br>as well so<br>when languages go wrong either with<br>stroke victims or with children you have<br>the whole feel of<br>disorders</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
