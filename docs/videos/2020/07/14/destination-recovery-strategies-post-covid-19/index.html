In many countries tourism has ground to a halt due to the dependency of international arrivals. Looking to the future, is there something we can learn from other destinations?<br><br>This webinar looks at the impact, response, and, recovery strategies of three destinations—New Zealand, Scotland,

and<br>government's webinar series on tourism<br>and what will look like in a portico be<br>at nineteen world today we're going to<br>focus on destination recovery strategies<br>and we have three speakers from across<br>the globe without doubt CEO v19 has had<br>the biggest impact in modern times on<br>tourism and there is without doubt nor<br>destination in the world that hasn't<br>been affected every sector every every<br>sector every product every country every<br>region every city every tourist in some<br>sort of format has been affected and so<br>the key question is how have these<br>destinations responded can we learn from<br>each other and what will the future look<br>like in a portico vat19 world today we<br>have three speakers from Scotland New<br>York and New Zealand the three speakers<br>are stephen ingrid hall the chief<br>executive of tourism new zealand who to<br>many of you will not need an<br>introduction he is the leader of New<br>Zealand's domestic and international<br>tourism destination management company<br>we have real grim who's the director of<br>strategy and partnerships for visit<br>Scotland the destination management<br>company of of Scotland and we have Donna<br>Karen who is the executive vice<br>president of the New York City and<br>Company destination management company<br>and each of these three speakers from<br>across the globe will tell us their<br>story what the impact of the CEO v19 has<br>been how they've responded and what they<br>think the future will look like so I<br>welcome our three speakers to this<br>webinar and first of all I'd like to<br>hand over to Stephen England hall chief<br>executive of tourism New Zealand who<br>will talk about<br>and we will talk about New Zealand's<br>response New Zealand's response to this<br>okay<br>so I'm going to switch off the slides<br>and then bring them bring them back to<br>Stephen we'll have the screen right good<br>good morning think Thank You Ian and<br>thank you to all the tendis for joining<br>us today for this discussion I'm not<br>going to make a particular slide<br>presentation I thought I would just<br>speak through the journey that we've<br>been on here in New Zealand and then<br>leave as much time as possible for a bit<br>of Q&amp;A and falling on the back of my<br>colleagues here presentations as well I<br>think so there's probably a couple of<br>things about about a couple of context<br>points for for New Zealand the first is<br>tourism newzealand up until COBIT 19<br>occurred was focused entirely on<br>international markets and we didn't<br>actually have a role in domestic<br>marketing or in domestic on the domestic<br>sort of tourism at all in New Zealand<br>but once Co mid-nineteen you know hit<br>New Zealand their borders closed and of<br>course the country effectively lockdown<br>bringing what was pre a covert 19 New<br>Zealand's largest export industry at 20<br>percent of export receipts and a<br>significant contributor to GDP here in<br>New Zealand and 8 percent and roughly<br>around the same number of employment<br>their whole industry of course just<br>stopped you know we have we actually hit<br>a point during the period in April we<br>had zero arrivals and zero departures to<br>New Zealand for the first time since I<br>think 1840 or something like that so it<br>was a very unusual situation and of<br>course with the country at lockdown<br>initially of course now we're we're out<br>of lockdown we're in it in a much more<br>open environment here in New Zealand and<br>then and that's um enabled domestic<br>tourism at least to start to recover<br>from our destination strategy point of<br>view as a consequence of the the impact<br>of the tourism sector and of course the<br>economic flow on impacts to New Zealand<br>of the sector running to a halt the<br>government made a decision in<br>collaboration with our board that<br>tourism you zealand would lead the the<br>initial reefs<br>of the tourism economy so that and focus<br>entirely on the domestic space initially<br>and then of course work across our<br>international markets to keep me on to<br>brand alive internationally with a view<br>to enabling us to accelerate<br>international tourism when when the time<br>comes no state to do so in the boards so<br>with that kind of shift in our mandate<br>you could imagine was pretty<br>we had to mobilize our team pretty<br>quickly to to change tack entirely and<br>establish a new destination marketing<br>team with a focus on domestic<br>marketplace as I mentioned before for<br>the fish habitat very long time and in<br>fact we've been up and running<br>completely fully now for about six weeks<br>some one domestic side of things and<br>their program is actually unfolding<br>incredibly well<br>and it's actually saying to have some<br>real impacts on how New Zealanders are<br>relating to New Zealand estimation it's<br>having an impact on the speed and rate<br>of recovery of the sector here in New<br>Zealand from a domestic point of view<br>and of course it's really helping to<br>prime the supply side of the sector for<br>you know what will initially be open you<br>know a more open marketplace and an<br>opportunity for us welcome international<br>guests so as an organisation right now<br>we really have four core strategies the<br>first one of course is to drive<br>participation and inclusion in the<br>domestic tourism economy and what that<br>really means is get more New Zealanders<br>out and about enjoying New Zealand as a<br>destination and effect relating to New<br>Zealand like it's a place to go on<br>holiday which set may sound quite funny<br>but many many people don't relate to<br>their own home or their own country as a<br>destination they think it's at this<br>where they when they travel abroad often<br>they consider it a destination so we've<br>actually had quite a bit of work to do<br>and we think it'll take some time to<br>change the relationship between Kiwis or<br>New Zealanders and New Zealand as a<br>place to actually go on holiday and<br>experience as a visitor and that's a big<br>shift not just for keywords mindsets but<br>also for for the new zealand tourism<br>industry to treat Kiwis as well like<br>visitors and it's a real shift there it<br>has to go on and I think that's this<br>you've been quite quite a bit of fun to<br>be here and we can see that it's gonna<br>unfold over time and have a really<br>positive impact for both New Zealanders<br>articles the industry the cecum<br>strategies around the international<br>peace I mentioned before whilst the<br>borders are closed it's imperative that<br>tourism newzealand keeps the idea of New<br>Zealand and the idea of the brand of you<br>circulate that the destination brand of<br>New Zealand alive and the hearts and<br>minds of consumers around the world the<br>two principal reasons one is going dark<br>or being off the air for any extended<br>period of time will slow down the<br>economic recovery of tourism when the<br>time comes and the second is there's a<br>direct relationship between our brand<br>awareness and desirability and<br>preference for New Zealand and other<br>exports such as food fibre technology<br>etc so keeping the brand alive when<br>people can't actually travel here is<br>incredibly important and obviously<br>requires real balance because the last<br>thing I want to do is run global<br>promotional marketing then asks people<br>to do something they can't actually do<br>so I've had to shift the tone out of<br>that international program completely to<br>accommodate that the third strategy is<br>around providing business support to<br>operators to enable them to best pivot<br>if you like or change their business<br>practice or model off of what is now<br>more sustainable and but significantly<br>reduce domestic tourism industry and<br>tourism base and happily a lot of<br>businesses make those decisions has been<br>really important for the long-term<br>survivability and recovery of the<br>industry and the fourth part which is<br>something that you can measure in a<br>copepod world has become incredibly<br>important and that's providing<br>evidence-based advice to government and<br>industry leaders and that last one is<br>really about how we inform decision<br>making how we inform policy change how<br>we inform and significant decisions that<br>governments have to make in these<br>difficult times with evidence about the<br>sector for the sector in through the<br>lens of the consumer but also through<br>the lens of the industry so I guess<br>that's probably it in a nutshell<br>and I'll leave it the arian if it's okay<br>there's give me about eight minutes<br>worth of content and and hopefully<br>that's sort of give you a bit of a<br>perspective on what's happening in New<br>Zealand and I look forward to answering<br>Thank You Steven you've raised lots of<br>interesting points there and we'll come<br>back to it at the end at the end of the<br>three speakers and what will risk many<br>of the points in questions there could I<br>remind remind participants if you've got<br>a question to ask please use the Q&amp;A<br>button at the bottom of your screen and<br>just taken the question and we'll either<br>answer your question during the session<br>or toward or towards the end and<br>there'll be an opportunity for the<br>panelists to respond to those questions<br>as well sorry my screen has frozen and<br>try again apologies for this<br>technological error no my screen has<br>frozen I'm afraid I'm I can't but just<br>so our next speaker is riddle grim and<br>it's a pleasure to welcome riddle to new<br>zealand here and there's many stories I<br>can tell you about riddle from the time<br>from my time as the scenario planner at<br>mrs. collared but this is on zoom in the<br>world as the world is watching so I<br>can't go into those details riddle grim<br>is the director of industry and<br>destination development of business<br>Scotland and has fundamentally led the<br>destinations response to CoV ID 19 so<br>without any further ado welcome little<br>Ian welcome and welcome to and whistling<br>from rather overcast 9:45 in the evening<br>and Scotland I could tell you what the<br>stories about Ian but yeah it would be<br>too embarrassing to share so you just<br>flip in at the next slide this just<br>gives you an idea of the impact the<br>impact that the virus has had on<br>Scotland's and just for those that don't<br>know the country population 5.4 million<br>18,000 people tested positive and as of<br>today almost two and a half thousand<br>deaths in the country so a huge health<br>issue let alone the economic impact next<br>slide yet and the importance of tourism<br>to the Scottish economy what's a lot of<br>money 10 a half billion or 200,000 jobs<br>8 percent of the total workforce and<br>then just look at that figure at the<br>bottom of the slide there are estimate<br>from April to June this year 1.6 billion<br>poems lost from tourism alone and was<br>business to the Scottish economy<br>ledian just to put the tourism in some<br>kind of context and interesting<br>listening to Stephen about his his<br>picture of the the world from New<br>Zealand domestic trips are very<br>important to us but international spend<br>is significantly more important so you<br>see that Slade they're fewer trips from<br>domestic market but much higher spend<br>from the international side as well next<br>slide here and this is the the visas<br>that our government said in terms of its<br>route map to get out of the virus<br>I suspect very similar to a number of<br>other countries fees one where we're<br>just dealing with it it's not contained<br>to there's some control three it's being<br>suppressed and then for the longer a<br>significant threat right now in Scotland<br>we're sitting between Phase two and<br>three and hopefully announcements<br>tomorrow will will ease that up when<br>there's the the four elements of the the<br>response to that respond reset restart<br>and recover so we're working through<br>that and none of them are actually<br>following neatly and we're still dealing<br>with a lot of response right now next<br>lady<br>so in 2001 we had a huge outbreak of<br>disease in Scotland and we created an<br>emergency response group and Ian was<br>pretty much involved in that in the<br>creation of that and we reactivated this<br>for kuba 19 so the response group is a<br>is a mix of private sector and public<br>sector bodies with government and we<br>kept the initial group was huge and it<br>just didn't work so we cut that down to<br>eat and that's been meeting on a weekly<br>basis since the 16th of March to<br>coordinate the work and it's developed<br>an action plan around those four hours<br>the immediate response providing<br>information support to businesses there<br>moving on to support and planning<br>encouraging people to restart then the<br>support and guidance to see reopening<br>then finally the recovery phase<br>providing direction for the future<br>next lady on my team are directly<br>involved I have somewhere in the region<br>of 300 staff that are engaging with<br>industry and engaging with customers on<br>the ground and these are some of the<br>things that as an organization<br>we've been responsible for just as<br>Steven said gathering research and<br>getting information that can help advise<br>policy and we've directly engaged in a<br>one-to-one basis with over three and a<br>half thousand businesses contacting them<br>with regular communications during<br>global research and travel market<br>intelligence comparing ourselves to<br>what's going on in the rest of the world<br>record the assurance scheme was<br>suspended saving a million pounds we set<br>up a destination fund supporting 83<br>destinations and 10,000 businesses<br>throughout the country and then<br>providing advice to businesses and one<br>of the big challenges was that as of<br>today there were 15 different funding<br>sources from UK and Scottish<br>Government's and we're giving advice and<br>support to them to apply next idea<br>and quite specifically what we've been<br>working on the past couple of weeks<br>helping the Scottish government develop<br>its guidance for the tourism and<br>hospitality industry for safely opening<br>and supporting that sector guidance for<br>the lakes of the mr. attraction sector<br>the hospitality sector the outdoor<br>sector and self-catering all supporting<br>that overall one and then we click on<br>the side there the good to go<br>self certification online scheme in in<br>Scotland as of today we've got nearly<br>four thousand businesses signed up to<br>that and that indicates that they've<br>read the criteria and the guidance and<br>they are good to go and they're meeting<br>all the requirements that are a key<br>essential part of that when I main<br>website a consumer facing website<br>although less things are being updated<br>and the good to go symbol is appearing<br>throughout and I've corporate website<br>which is used by businesses there's been<br>a huge source of information for them as<br>well and then finally just the names<br>last week first meeting ministerial task<br>force looking at the priorities for<br>recovery next lady on a significant<br>concern within Scotland has been the<br>concern of communities worried about<br>people bringing the virus back into<br>their area number of our island<br>communities have had no virus whatsoever<br>and so we've been working very closely<br>and engaging with them through rural<br>tourism fund best practice and long<br>strong regional and local engagement on<br>an ongoing basis<br>on the next slide and just finish off<br>with a few slides on owed marketing<br>recovery and again neatly linked to<br>those initially those four main parts<br>respond reset restart and recover pretty<br>much like New Zealand in the early<br>response part not marketing the country<br>but keeping it front of mind dream no<br>travel later a big message and then on<br>the reset side dream though travel later<br>but trying to get people engaged with<br>inspiring content and then as of next<br>week when we start to reopen<br>reconnecting Scott's with Scotland and a<br>very strong message stay local and<br>engage locally and then moving out of<br>that towards the international marketing<br>scene as well thanks Lydia supporting<br>that all the way through ongoing<br>research on sentiment in the UK market<br>and holiday intentions to Scotland that<br>has changed as you would imagine over<br>the past month or so and we're keeping<br>that front of mine as we as we look to<br>hit the right kind of markets from our<br>marketing point of view next slide and<br>the clips and the creative proposition<br>around escapism stories or inspiring<br>drama and distressing and the really<br>important one about that sense of<br>belonging okay connecting Scots with a<br>country very much like New Zealand<br>connecting with their country as well<br>final three slides Ian and really<br>important that we develop them as the<br>pledge one thing everyone to enjoy and<br>discover Scotland visitors businesses<br>and communities alike and showing that<br>in terms of planning ahead enjoying the<br>best of Scotland and protecting others<br>and that message of safe and then<br>approach initially telling people of<br>Scotland that the country needs them and<br>scale then moving on to the weight of<br>domestic market or an important market<br>England and the rest of Scotland and<br>then it eventually the international<br>market and a full recovery fees so again<br>happy to answer questions and now it's a<br>quick run free and I'm sure there will<br>be more questions that as we go through<br>screens frozen again unit stick here if<br>you need some additional help I've got<br>the PowerPoint slide ready to go for a<br>moment okay next slide please<br>okay I have to bring that and stop your<br>sharing one second riddle thank you very<br>much for that wonderful insight and<br>presentation and Scotland seems to be<br>right in the center of core it could be<br>a ID in nineteen and there's many issues<br>that you brought up there we which we<br>can um discuss at the end of the<br>presentations and can I please remind<br>dispensed if you've got any questions to<br>ask please use the Q&amp;A button and as we<br>wait I'd like to introduce our next<br>speaker which is Donna Donna Karen who's<br>the executive vice president of New York<br>City and company and basically when you<br>think of New York and you think of CoV<br>lat ID 19 we think of New Yorkers being<br>right at the center right at the center<br>in the epicenter in the United States<br>and we've all seen the stories flashed<br>across the world about the Kipp the<br>earlier on case Donna and welcome to New<br>Zealand and we'll just get your<br>presentation up in a minute and we can<br>go from there apologies for some of the<br>technology technology issues very used<br>to it<br>so thank you first in thank you the<br>staff at Victoria University in the<br>background and not always in the<br>background thank you for your<br>behind-the-scenes efforts it is a real<br>pleasure for me to share this event with<br>Ridout and with Stefan<br>that I was breathing deeply as you were<br>talking because I was listening to such<br>smart destination marketers at the<br>national level and I just want to start<br>next slide by introducing what NYC and<br>company is where the official<br>destination marketing organization for<br>the city of New York we are a private<br>membership organization which will<br>distinguish us in some of the ways that<br>things here are very similar to what<br>you've just heard from my colleagues but<br>will also be different one of the things<br>I'm a native New Yorker that I'd like to<br>remind people is that New York is an<br>island off the coast of America and so<br>we have somewhat unique position there<br>are many more cases outside of New York<br>City in New York State at the moment<br>then there are or have been in New York<br>so we're shifting the balance a little<br>bit but that private-sector positioning<br>becomes very important to what we're<br>doing next slide we are facing the<br>coated 19 situation by doing it<br>collectively what you're looking at here<br>is the beginning of a manifesto for how<br>we were going to reach out to our<br>industry or city the business community<br>to create a coalition to work together<br>to bring about the recovery this was<br>designed for the hospitality and tourism<br>industry and like you heard it was<br>somewhat of a shift from looking at<br>visitors whether domestic or<br>international to focusing on our local<br>population next Coalition website looks<br>like this it came together in early<br>April as we began to reach out to the<br>community for private sector engagement<br>and support it's chaired by a diverse<br>array of leaders from the hospitality<br>and leisure sector including restaurants<br>museums hotel<br>and the arts for those of you who know<br>that New York it is also a five borough<br>representation that is all the parts of<br>New York City I encourage you to check<br>out our website because you can see this<br>publicly coalition dot NYC geo dot-com<br>and as I think I mentioned literally the<br>coalition just finished a meeting three<br>minutes ago discussing the program that<br>I'm going to be sharing with you right<br>now<br>next slide so we had to approach this<br>and this will look very familiar to what<br>you've just heard a coalition set of<br>goals that would be phased in but work<br>that would grow out of both the<br>experience of the tourism experts and<br>leadership as well as the current need<br>first and foremost was an absolute<br>commitment to public health and safety<br>that leads everything we are doing<br>second was to drive it by creativity and<br>innovation the thing that we believe is<br>part of the DNA of New York City and<br>third to do it in partnership with<br>leaders across industries to meet a need<br>that was greater than any DMO or tourism<br>organization could do on its own next so<br>what's at stake I don't usually need to<br>tell researchers and tourism people<br>about these statistics this is something<br>we put in the coalition report for<br>government but we're talking about 67<br>million visitors last year 10 years of<br>record performance a 72 billion dollar<br>industry 400 plus thousand jobs and<br>similar to what you were both mentioning<br>20% of New York visitation is<br>international but our international<br>visitors spend about 50% of the money<br>that gets spent and that has completely<br>come to a stop so as we go forward from<br>this five months dropped<br>to virtually nothing how do we move<br>forward I keep reaching for adjectives<br>that can encompass the scope of what's<br>going on my latest is unthinkable but in<br>fact it's pretty much all any of us are<br>thinking about so maybe I said<br>unanswerable because the answer's many<br>of us have found don't seem to solve to<br>the problems economic or social and as<br>the resurgence of disease across the US<br>and other destinations suggests we<br>haven't found the entire solution yet<br>but we're marketers and we're<br>researchers and we can't accept that<br>there are no answers so that too is<br>unthinkable but we're going to try and<br>deal with this as best we can so next<br>slide the best we can is a plan in three<br>stages that is rise renew recover it's a<br>slightly abbreviated version of what we<br>just saw for Scotland this comes<br>directly from the coalition blueprint<br>which we release this more this<br>afternoon and these are active verbs<br>these are phases of reimagining<br>reactivating rebuilding the industry to<br>support the city and with that<br>neighborhoods and jobs the image up at<br>the right hand corner is familiar to all<br>of us it's a logical approach from your<br>locals to your drive market to your<br>domestic and beyond but it also actually<br>matches the profile of those 66 million<br>visitors that I talked about one quarter<br>of the US population lives within a one<br>day's Drive of New York and they are our<br>largest domestic market and that is<br>probably close to 30 million people a<br>year so that is aside from our immediate<br>local that is our next target next slide<br>so we're past stage one and rise which<br>was primarily to assure and educate both<br>the businesses<br>locally and our consumers this is 17<br>weeks at this point and it has been two<br>things the focus on essential safety<br>protocols and regulations and a way to<br>keep the businesses in New York City<br>thriving to the extent that we can next<br>slide so we had a number of tactics I'm<br>going to go through quickly one was<br>aimed at our membership it's 2,000<br>businesses and enterprises and<br>organizations who needed to hear from us<br>as the leadership or who we could bring<br>in to educate them on safety and other<br>issues next we also had to talk to<br>consumers and here we coordinated and<br>promoted efforts to identify what was<br>physically open in the city restaurants<br>and stores that you could take out pick<br>up or go to for delivery or what in the<br>case of cultural organizations and<br>tourist attractions we're making virtual<br>experiences available there are more<br>than 250 of them at this point and these<br>are extremely popular parts of our<br>website and activity drivers next<br>there's a b2b educational content going<br>back to our relationships with the<br>travel trade and on the right hand side<br>something that is really begun to take<br>off through the meeting planners virtual<br>psych tours we're getting very very<br>positive reaction to that next slide so<br>stage 2 was all about inspiration and<br>encouragement and to a very large extent<br>repositioning NYC in company because as<br>both of my colleagues have mentioned<br>talking to your locals was not our<br>primary job our primary job was bringing<br>in other people so we rethought and<br>restructured some of what we're doing<br>we're in Phase three<br>in New York which is not quite as open<br>as we at home<br>no indoor dining at the moment but and<br>we have added 22 States to the list of<br>people who if they come to New York from<br>those United States destinations mostly<br>in the south and the West will need to<br>self quarantine for 14 days these are<br>the places in the US now with<br>uncontrolled increases in infection New<br>York led the way through this process we<br>not only leveled the curve we have<br>pretty much brought it down to very very<br>low levels and we are working as a state<br>in the city to protect that next like I<br>mentioned before the notion of health<br>and safety we created a stay well NYC<br>pledge it launched on June 23rd and it<br>is both a business pledged to protect<br>their employees and the customers and a<br>guests pledge to behave responsibly<br>wearing masks excuse me and following<br>the best safety protocols we have a<br>hashtag that has just launched called<br>mask on NYC we think it's very important<br>to show just how acceptable mask wearing<br>is it's become a fashion accessory I<br>just bought my most fashionable mask the<br>other day next so I mentioned that we're<br>reaching out there's a lot of user<br>generated and visual content Ian told me<br>no videos so you're just gonna have to<br>imagine how beautiful these are or check<br>out our website NYC go.com to see what<br>we've been able to do next slide I think<br>one of the most exciting tactics that is<br>launching last week and will run for the<br>next couple of months is a public art<br>fund partnership we're calling our art<br>on the grid it's 50 New York artists 50<br>new were<br>works being phased and Tim works at a<br>time across the city's out-of-home<br>advertising spaces so it's dispersed<br>around the city it's easy to get to it's<br>free and we're working on ways of<br>connecting those sites to the businesses<br>in the area to encourage shopping dining<br>other activities and we're beginning to<br>track that with some big data<br>opportunities next slide so this was the<br>big news that hit my organization in the<br>press this morning all in NYC is the<br>recovery branding campaign my creative<br>director likes to say it's deceptively<br>simple we're all in New York City<br>because we can't get out or because we<br>don't want to go anywhere else<br>we're all in as we've thrown in<br>everything we got to make this city<br>survive and of course everything you<br>want or needs is all in New York City<br>this is going to be an online campaign<br>it will be an out of home campaign it<br>will be social it will be digital and it<br>is a rallying cry and a platform for<br>taking us into the future<br>and because I have New Zealanders on the<br>call let me just say that if you are a<br>surfer there is astonishing surfing off<br>the coast of New York in the Atlantic<br>Ocean and you can take your surfboard on<br>the subway so when we open you're<br>welcome to come back next slide this is<br>stage 3 and we're not here yet we<br>believe we will be but we are not so all<br>I can say now is watch for it and as my<br>colleague Adam Sachs from tourism<br>economics says recovery is inevitable<br>next slide and because I head up the<br>research unit I just want to point out<br>the roadmap for recovery which we just<br>released includes four whole pages on<br>research well three if you discount the<br>saben the lucky 7 which is<br>chapter heading on how we're going to<br>measure the effects of the Cova crisis<br>and our recovery next slide<br>happy to share this with folks because<br>it's way too small to read but this is<br>in the plan on how we are going to<br>measure each phase of the recovery and<br>what we're looking to do I'm open to<br>suggestions ideas connections anything<br>you're muted thank you to all of our<br>three speakers<br>Riddle Steven and Donna three wonderful<br>insights into how three different<br>destinations of different stages within<br>CEO Vig 19 have responded and I think<br>upon reflection the devastation of of<br>this disease of this pandemic has been<br>huge across the world and here in New<br>Zealand personally I just feel very<br>lucky in the terms of how we've managed<br>it and how we write isolated from the<br>rest of the world but the attitudes of<br>people towards each other has been<br>absolutely wonderful and I see very much<br>similar messages in Scotland and in New<br>York so before we go any further just do<br>riddle Steven don't listen to the other<br>listening to the other two speakers that<br>you can't is anything that resonates<br>with you so first of all - Steven yeah<br>thank you<br>I guess one of the obvious similarities<br>between the different destination and<br>face of thinking will have slightly<br>different words for them but the gist of<br>it being you know how do you respond<br>immediately how do you work together and<br>collaborate with others to restart the<br>economy and tourism and make sure people<br>feel safe and secure in doing so<br>and then how do you use the process to I<br>guess reimagine if you like for lack of<br>better term how the tourism industry<br>would shape itself in the future and I<br>think that what comes through pretty<br>clearly to me as that burns very similar<br>the other couple of things that<br>disappoints my one is and I think you<br>touch this tui and you know New<br>Zealand's part because of its geography<br>and part of partly because of its its I<br>guess action you know the nature of the<br>actions taken by my government very<br>early on does seem to be a little bit<br>further ahead in terms of dealing with<br>the immediate crisis and certainly<br>that's how it's how it feels to me it's<br>sort of that we have a lot more freedom<br>of movement you know this we don't have<br>cover to me in the community at the<br>current time and New Zealand so people<br>are able to freely move about and I<br>think that has a very very big impact on<br>the rate of recovery of the tourism<br>industry at a local regional and<br>national level just that that ability to<br>move around I think we would I think we<br>just have to I guess um reflect been<br>listening to Donna and I'll serve it all<br>about how quickly we could take that for<br>granted you know<br>Perik half power that's an incredibly<br>important I guess milestones who have<br>achieved and therefore how we make sure<br>that we we gain on that build on that<br>particular status and therefore not turn<br>not be complacent about it's very<br>important they'll probably be like my<br>first my first observations and then I<br>guess the Elven is just this this this<br>local you know the local the regional<br>the national the international that<br>phasing and I think it's really<br>important I saw a question and which I<br>replied to in writing the counter asking<br>about the weather I feel that them<br>postcard were would see more recognition<br>of the need for the sector to deliver<br>value to the local community in the<br>domestic market with it's a permanent<br>shift and I think it is I mean I<br>actually think people will be less<br>complacent about the importance of the<br>local and domestic consumer in visitor<br>to places then perhaps they have been<br>from the while it is real I think it's<br>gonna be<br>key component of the future tourism<br>economy even though it's always been<br>there I don't think it's necessarily<br>been directly addressed at a destination<br>management level there's this social<br>marketing level it's always been in<br>others coming in if you like that seems<br>to be the focus so I think that's one of<br>the takeaways from the discussion this<br>morning middle you know degree I think<br>really interesting listening to Steven<br>about encouraging New Zealanders to know<br>just rediscovered but discover their own<br>country I mean I think we've always had<br>a tradition in Scotland that people have<br>holiday in Scotland but over the past<br>number of years more and more have<br>traveled abroad to the son destinations<br>and summer weather is not particularly<br>reliable and however this year I think<br>given the lockdown more and more people<br>more and more Scots will solid in<br>Scotland for the first time for a number<br>of years and I think that's really good<br>because they will discover something<br>that they've not been aware of for some<br>time like Steven I was struck by the<br>similarities particularly New York and<br>they're almost at different words but<br>the same approach and we don't have very<br>similar situation weird<br>you're still pretty much in lockdown<br>only last fraidy where we allowed to<br>travel any more than five miles from<br>home so it would have mattered if the<br>whole of the tourism industry opened up<br>we would have been able to get there now<br>that's changed as of last Friday we can<br>travel anywhere in Scotland and<br>self-catering open for the first time<br>last week and there's been a huge spike<br>in demand for that purely because<br>there's a pent-up demand and people<br>suddenly recognize this is a great<br>opportunity to help the industry recover<br>and we're hoping that we'll get more<br>announcements tomorrow from our First<br>Minister one of the big challenges we've<br>got which maybe people don't quite<br>understand is that although were part of<br>the United Kingdom we have our own<br>government and tourism is devolved and a<br>lot of other functions are devolved and<br>so I live almost on the border between<br>Scotland and England and the policies in<br>England are different dis Colin<br>terrorism's opened up more quickly in<br>England than it has in Scotland which is<br>a bit frustrating first live just on the<br>other side of the river here so I think<br>that's a bit of a challenge between the<br>two governments in terms of policy and<br>decision making but yeah a lot of<br>similarities that I had and all three<br>presentations Donna thank you I want to<br>echo some of that and reposition it in<br>in our case the 50 US states don't see<br>eye to eye and don't follow the same<br>rules and don't have a national<br>government taking a leadership role I'm<br>envious I have a very strong governor<br>who has positioned himself as one of the<br>sages and leaders of this the city's<br>tourism industry takes this very<br>seriously but there was never time here<br>where you weren't allowed to travel your<br>travel was limited by other localised<br>rules whether you had to self quarantine<br>and obviously a state like Hawaii which<br>can only be reached by air or water have<br>been able to do that in a way that the<br>rest of us who are connected to the<br>mainland in one way or another have not<br>been able to do but I think what I heard<br>from all of us was you pull from your<br>experience because you're assuming<br>certain things about human nature human<br>psychology the human desire to travel<br>and be social and you know that it's<br>been disrupted by not travelling more<br>than five miles or not having the<br>ability to leave the country you know<br>let's have someone come in and that<br>pent-up demand that dreaming about<br>travel that tapping into<br>people's expectations aspirations plans<br>not for the next six weeks or six months<br>but travelers want to travel and as long<br>as you understand that and what they're<br>looking for and I heard that from the<br>other presentations to quote Adam Sachs<br>again recovery is inevitable I really<br>don't think that all of us want to sit<br>in our kitchens apartments and home<br>offices for the rest of our lives in<br>isolation I'm just wondering if riddles<br>Steven and Donna would like to share<br>just one moment one story of success<br>success or and what am I trying to ask<br>the question the question I'm trying to<br>ask what has been the opportunity or<br>silver lining Alta Corbett 19 to you<br>something emerged that's been a good<br>story I can I start and then um I think<br>it was leadership I think it<br>repositioned my organization in the eyes<br>of a lot of local people local<br>businesses especially elected officials<br>and brought together a coalition of<br>leaders who might not necessarily have<br>been engaged with each other that was<br>across the diversity of business level<br>sizes the u.s. is dealing with a very<br>very deep and old set of issues about<br>inclusion and diversity and we are<br>taking a leadership position as an<br>industry in directly addressing that so<br>when you're bringing in record numbers<br>of visitors every year for 10 years in a<br>row people expect it and they<br>pay attention and when that stops as it<br>has virtually down to nothing all of a<br>sudden they are looking to you for<br>answers and for leadership for a way to<br>help us move forward so it's big burden<br>but I think that is the silver lining<br>for us as an organization and for the<br>industry as a whole if I could answer<br>from a Scottish perspective I think the<br>really important thing that's come<br>through from the way that we've been<br>dealing with it and the way that the<br>whole thing is what I it is is the<br>importance of involving the community<br>and therefore as a result that piece<br>around a future that is much more<br>focused on responsible tourism rather<br>than you know large numbers low value<br>I think the future will be about quality<br>and that's come through really strongly<br>community concern about bringing the<br>virus in has made people realize that<br>communities need to have a role in the<br>policy-making in the decision maker<br>tiers and businesses are part of that<br>community<br>but equally that getting that balance<br>rate is something that's come through<br>very strongly and I'm just hoping that<br>that continues in the future and we<br>don't revert back to what we were before<br>so I think from a is that a silver<br>lining yeah I think that greater<br>interaction with communities is<br>something that has come through really<br>strongly indeed Steven yeah I think like<br>the comments from donor n Riddler I<br>think of being on this lit this has been<br>a significant opportunity for leadership<br>particularly around the tourism sector<br>and the visitor economy and I think the<br>role of community in coordination at a<br>local levels I think been a real<br>highlight so far the ability to engage<br>in a different way and I have a<br>different conversation about the sector<br>and from a from us from a tourism New<br>Zealand perspective I think having the<br>opportunity to pick up the mantle on<br>domestic<br>of the tourism economy and bringing a<br>domestic and international together and<br>they're forming out a crate I'm much<br>more holistic view of the shape and<br>impact of this system and the sector is<br>going to be something that I think more<br>understand us in very good stead going<br>forward and it will give us the<br>different I guess set of levers to work<br>with as an organization to have a more<br>meaningful and positive impact and a<br>community social environmental and of<br>course economic level silver lining and<br>I think the other one which builds on<br>that is we've had to reconnect and<br>rebuild a number of relationships as a<br>business within government but also very<br>importantly with regional New Zealand in<br>a way that we haven't had to do for a<br>while and I think I think it's gonna<br>again be something that's been a real<br>bonus it's been a real eye-opener for<br>the organization and you know I think<br>it's gonna it's gonna be something that<br>we on and increasingly and you know have<br>impacts on our insights our<br>understanding of participation how we<br>make the industry more inclusive how I<br>Drive better understanding amongst New<br>Zealanders of the importance of tourism<br>to their lifestyle the community the<br>richness in fabric of the places they<br>live work and play as well and I think<br>those those connections and that fabric<br>that's been built as a co but 19<br>associate of it and so just a couple of<br>questions Thank You Steven just a couple<br>to everybody from a marketing<br>perspective or an engagement perspective<br>how is the message different now in the<br>terms of USDM or engaging with a<br>domestic market how is the message<br>different<br>you mean do you mean are you asking in<br>from a perspective of the marketing the<br>content yeah well a couple of questions<br>have come through and I think riddle<br>picked up and yourself picked up did<br>that hasn't been a desire previously for<br>people to holiday in their own<br>destination you know the the the<br>aspiration was to go abroad the desire<br>was to go abroad and so the message but<br>that message is now different but how do<br>you have a different audience who have<br>different values so how do you reimagine<br>tourism to look to those audiences and<br>how is the engagement differently if it<br>because you're not doing it to an<br>international market it's more of a<br>domestic market maybe they'll have a<br>crack at there to start with<br>that's got it's quite a complex question<br>Donna would like you to answer that one<br>Oh while Stephen thinks about it yeah I<br>mean I think I can have touched on it<br>and in the marketing part of my<br>obviously the stages are Scott's to<br>Scotts holding in Scotland the domestic<br>market Yukie to Scotland and then<br>international so the message has been<br>very much around highlighting that the<br>huge opportunities the hidden gems the<br>things that people may have forgotten<br>about in their own country that are on<br>their own doorstep and the opportunities<br>to yeah revisit some of the memories<br>that we've had from from a long a long<br>time ago so I think that the messaging<br>will be around all of those things the<br>iconic images that we've got the<br>reminding Scots what they are and also<br>keep in Scotland front of mind and<br>making people feel proud of their own<br>country I think that's a very strong<br>element that's coming through in the<br>messaging that we're going to put out<br>but very strong image based<br>and touching heartstrings dispose of<br>Scott's donut of Stephen so we just need<br>to unmute and Donna sorry we've had some<br>experience in the past with what we got<br>a term I like but we call the staycation<br>that you don't need to travel very far<br>to come to a city like New York which<br>pretty much has everything in it as I<br>said surfing and the ocean but that<br>rebuilding that pride is a part of it<br>certainly there are lots of stories<br>about people giving up on cities and<br>watch out New Zealand in Scotland<br>because you may be getting some of them<br>who think they can work from home and<br>live and be out of doors<br>so our messaging has always had this<br>double sided since all are welcomed and<br>you'll find yourself here whether that's<br>for a long weekend or a two-week<br>vacation or just you chose New York and<br>most of the people that eight and a half<br>million people who live here are not<br>from here I'm one of the native borns<br>and we are a minority so we tell that<br>story to ourselves and to each other and<br>to our domestic and our international<br>markets people like to come and watch us<br>the complexity and speed and diversity<br>of New York life is like any of the<br>world's great cities one of those things<br>that travelers come to take a look at<br>and we're just doing a job of reminding<br>people who live locally that it's there<br>for them I think pair<br>has a great model of this it's basically<br>Paris for Parisians and you can have the<br>museum with no tourists so go check it<br>out because they're not there to get in<br>your way and so those things that you<br>couldn't go see you can go and<br>experience right now Stephen thank you<br>thank you thank you donor was very<br>interesting and I think from our point<br>of view<br>domestically it's the core campaign<br>message platform you're using as cool do<br>something new New Zealand and that's<br>built on the south side that people need<br>to do something that they haven't done<br>before which answers a few other<br>questions and hear about you know what<br>is the positioning taken for granted and<br>and to people really to get out and<br>experience and understand your Zealand I<br>think it's it's a hundred percent driven<br>by that better insight that New<br>Zealanders need to go and do something<br>new and break habits because we're quite<br>a bit you holidaymakers in our own back<br>garden we go to the batch and we all<br>holiday house for non Kiwis on the call<br>you know and you buy things from the<br>grocery store and and that's kind of a<br>routine where you stay at friends and<br>family and what we really want to do is<br>get people to break the routine and do<br>something new because I'm doing<br>something new they'll experience parts<br>of New Zealand they haven't experienced<br>before they'll go to places meet people<br>try activities and things that's the<br>Corrib and domestic campaign messaging<br>and it's gonna be several years worth of<br>work and there'll be the phases and<br>waves to that activity so that we we<br>target take off different parts of New<br>Zealand's economy as we do so<br>internationally a couple of years ago we<br>we shifted a hundred percent pure New<br>Zealand's positioning from being about<br>being oh really only about our place and<br>we added our people in there and you<br>would have some of you wouldn't be<br>familiar with that good morning world<br>campaign which finished in June which<br>was about bringing some of the human<br>aspects of New Zealand to life in an<br>international marketing and with we<br>actually had planned to continue to<br>evolve that narrative to bring in more<br>of our values based views of the world<br>into sort of a place people and purpose<br>kind of narrative and we're going to<br>continue to evolve that and in<br>internationally right now as I mentioned<br>at beginning keeping our brand alive is<br>very very important and so that this<br>thing less emphasis on the visitation<br>piece and more emphasis on who we are<br>because obviously you can still consume<br>our wine and drink our beer and buy our<br>fiber and use our technology and<br>digitally experience different things<br>and you can still plan for a visit here<br>sometime in the future<br>you just can't physically commute and so<br>we've had to find a way of shifting<br>their that their messaging to keep users<br>I guess values front center of our core<br>audiences internationally well they<br>can't come so that's probably the two<br>big things okay and thank you very much<br>it's now 9:30 so I'm going to bring this<br>webinar to two applause so first of all<br>I'd like to thank riddle Steven and<br>Donna some some some excellent ain't<br>insights would also a common message<br>that we the common messages that we have<br>between us and I think there's a<br>realization amongst political leaders<br>and the audiences of our destinations<br>how important tourism is and what a<br>difference community what it does for<br>our culture and what it does<br>economically and I think is very<br>important and how the three the three<br>countries and destination Scotland New<br>Zealand and New York have responded to<br>this crisis as much we can learn so<br>thank you very much and it's really<br>appreciated<br>whether it's 10:30 or evening or one<br>o'clock in the afternoon or breakfast<br>here in New Zealand I really appreciate<br>the contribution that you made and your<br>comments and just for the audience and<br>this video has been recorded and it will<br>be placed onto YouTube those that have<br>registered for the seminar will receive<br>a copy to that link so people can<br>re-watch this webinar on time and I used<br>to remind people that the next two we've<br>got two more webinars planned at<br>Victoria University were on the 9th for<br>June<br>sorry yeah one on the 22nd of July on<br>revenue management and value pricing and<br>then one on the<br>10th of August on responsible tourism in<br>New Zealand and what the future could<br>look like and again they'll be on ours<br>our University website so thank you for<br>very much and has in Jacinda often says<br>to us please be kind and I look forward<br>to revisiting New York and Scotland and<br>I've already booked my holiday in the<br>Coromandel this year so I'm going to be<br>doing what Stephens been asking us to do<br>in practice thank you very much thank<br>you thank you everybody</p></main><footer
