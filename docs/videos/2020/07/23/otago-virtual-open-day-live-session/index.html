ora<br>my name is professor harleen hayne and<br>i'm the vice chancellor here at the<br>university of otago<br>it's my pleasure to welcome you to<br>otago's first<br>virtual open day this year has seen the<br>world face unprecedented challenges<br>and here in new zealand we are very<br>fortunate to be out of lockdown<br>and looking forward to welcoming new<br>students on campus next year<br>i encourage you to look through our<br>short presentations for more than 100 of<br>our academic programs and courses<br>take part in a virtual tour of our<br>beautiful campus<br>and look inside our residential colleges<br>we have experts on hand to help answer<br>any questions you might have<br>so make sure to use our live chat we are<br>here to help you through your journey<br>i look forward to welcoming you to the<br>university of otago<br>so thank you vice chancellor for your<br>words for those of you who don't know<br>a vice chancellor is the the overall<br>head of the university the academic head<br>and the admin head a little bit like a<br>school principal<br>um if you will now i'd like to welcome<br>we have got the director of health<br>sciences first year we have got joe<br>kerbin associate professor joe kerman<br>with us and we also have a<br>student from pharmacy isabelle at<br>mclaughlin so welcome to you both<br>thank you okay kiara and uh can we start<br>with you joe please tell us a little bit<br>about health sciences first year it's a<br>very popular program<br>great so health sciences first year is<br>really a gateway program to our<br>professional<br>health science courses so things like<br>medicine dentistry<br>pharmacy radiation technology<br>oral health there's many many different<br>pathways that you can go to as well<br>and also for students who are interested<br>in the health sciences in general so<br>thinking about biomedical sciences or<br>health science degrees<br>wonderful thank you very much um<br>isabella can i ask ask you next what's<br>it like being a health psy first year<br>student<br>um i think you can expect that it is<br>going to be a hard year you know you're<br>being thrown into<br>a deep end most i'd say majority of<br>students are coming straight from high<br>school so it's a lot different<br>you know you're probably living living<br>away from home you're living in a hall<br>lots of different social events going on<br>as well as trying to juggle all your<br>studies and<br>you know it's four papers in the first<br>semester so it is a big step up and i'd<br>say it's a lot different from high<br>school especially with the studying<br>techniques as well so looking back on<br>your experience you were well supported<br>doing health cycle first year<br>yes of course um so i was in one of the<br>halls in otago and the halls offer great<br>support they offer tutoring<br>even the course coordinators as well if<br>you're struggling with certain areas you<br>can always go and<br>talk to lecturers if you make the time<br>there is tutors<br>being run through the past papers as<br>well so the uni offers a great support<br>system for students<br>wonderful thank you joe back to you i<br>wonder not every student who does<br>healthside first year<br>will want to or will be able to do a<br>professional program<br>what else can healthsci first year lead<br>on to so<br>as i mentioned earlier they can go into<br>health sciences in general so there's<br>biomedical science degrees but there's<br>also<br>many many different health science<br>programs that actually teach into the<br>health science first year program and so<br>i think one way i look at this program<br>is it's a bit of a smorgasbord of<br>different<br>um different aspects of biomedical<br>science and so you can<br>learn about things like neuroscience or<br>immunology<br>you can learn about biochemistry as well<br>as chemistry and physics so<br>you get a really nice perspective of the<br>different sciences and now even we have<br>a little bit of humanities in the course<br>as well<br>so students get this real really nice<br>taste of many many different aspects of<br>health sciences and more broadly<br>speaking sciences and even now in the<br>arts<br>and so there's a lot of directions that<br>you can take from that base<br>fantastic thank you actually i was<br>talking today with a student who's doing<br>the population health paper his name's<br>aj<br>and he was saying how exciting he was to<br>be doing this because with this world of<br>covert<br>it's more relevant than ever so he was<br>really buzzing about that and it was<br>just lovely to<br>to have a word with him um earlier today<br>isabella can we go back to you for a<br>second now and<br>can we say what advice would you have<br>for health sci first year students<br>coming in next year<br>um i think it would be to keep your mind<br>open to the opportunities that the<br>health science course can lead to<br>like joe said there are a lot other a<br>lot of other options that can be taken<br>from the health sciences program there's<br>a lot of different pathways you can go<br>i think another good piece of advice is<br>to set your own goals so set personal<br>goals for yourself<br>you know you don't want to be setting<br>goals that your roommate or your next<br>neighbor has in the hall it's really<br>important that you set ones that are<br>going to make you happy and are going to<br>help you succeed in your university<br>career wonderful thank you good advice<br>joe i know that one aspect of the health<br>sciences program is youcat<br>can you tell us a sentence or two about<br>that please to provide information<br>sure so you cat i think probably a lot<br>of students hear about it and are a<br>little bit nervous about it it's the<br>university clinical aptitude<br>test and it's basically testing um<br>it's a it's a test that gets used to<br>measure certain qualities in people who<br>are going into clinical programs and so<br>that would be medicine and dentistry for<br>example<br>and it looks at reasoning<br>it looks at making judgments and it<br>looks at<br>making learning how to make decisions<br>and<br>you can't study for it but you can<br>prepare for it and it's<br>held outside of the university and so<br>students get the opportunity to get some<br>practice with that it's not as<br>terrifying as what it may<br>like not terrifying because you know<br>sometimes out in the community we do<br>hear how scary it is<br>so joe what would be your best advice<br>for students coming into health science<br>first year next year<br>my best advice would be to be organised<br>bring your a-game<br>but also try and be balanced and so and<br>get some down time enjoy the social<br>aspects of being in a residential<br>college<br>and try and stay on top of your material<br>so engage whenever you've got the<br>opportunity to engage<br>wonderful thank you so much indeed so if<br>you have further questions about<br>healthside first year<br>join in the virtual chat coming up next<br>as we live through this extraordinary<br>experience<br>one of the most important things we've<br>needed is<br>information about what's happening<br>about what we're discovering about what<br>else we can do to keep<br>ourselves safe thankfully during this<br>time<br>our health professionals our media<br>our community and our country's leaders<br>have had trusted<br>experts they can turn to it comes down<br>to a risk management<br>decision this is up to all new<br>zealanders<br>who are sharing the knowledge needed to<br>help protect new zealanders<br>and keep our country moving even when it<br>felt like the world around us<br>stopped and many of these people<br>are our people it's an honor and a<br>privilege to be playing our part<br>name<br>so campus watch is a key part of our<br>student pastoral care<br>they their teams work 24 hours a day<br>seven days a week<br>in around campus and around the streets<br>of north dunedin<br>the key thing is that they are readily<br>available to assist and advise<br>students they are very very important<br>part of our student welfare network<br>they have prepared a short video for us<br>for our viewing pleasure so<br>hi my name's mark i'm a member of otago<br>university's own budget version of the<br>avengers<br>campus watch i've been marinating in<br>otago student culture since the mid 90s<br>and i've been involved in a bunch of<br>film and tv projects with people you<br>probably don't care about<br>here's me with taiwai titi rebecca<br>gibney<br>with imaging poots and black christmas<br>and a bunch of other people<br>who you probably don't care about but<br>your parents might<br>hey campus watch hey bro catch<br>but enough about me let's talk about you<br>and how campus watch can help you get<br>the most out of your otago university<br>experience<br>campus watch provides pastoral care for<br>otago staff<br>and students from mundane security<br>duties like unlocking offices and uni<br>flat doors<br>to more specific services like our<br>safety car which offers students a free<br>ride home after a hard night of hitting<br>the<br>books plus if feeling safe and<br>comfortable is your thing<br>as it should be you'll be stoked to know<br>that every campus watch team has at<br>least one female staff member<br>that's what i'm talking about which is<br>nice<br>hey campus watch can you jumpstart my<br>car<br>investigate the smell of gas check my<br>flat every night while i'm gone over the<br>mid-semester break<br>repair this broken window lend me a<br>trailer provide<br>safe storage for my rifle and give my<br>flat a new recycling then<br>yes yes we can<br>and because life is really fair when<br>something truly serious happens<br>campus watch can help then too every<br>campus watch member has<br>a full clean driver's license and a<br>current first aid certificate<br>plus if you find yourself the victim of<br>a crime you can come into campus watch<br>and fill in a cctv review request<br>form meaning our network of cameras all<br>over the student quarter<br>can help you find justice<br>don't buy this campus watch propaganda<br>brothers<br>they're just jack-booted fascists who<br>want to ruin our fun<br>hashtag yolo hashtag<br>read the cop hashtag literally genghis<br>khan<br>oh you face the young firebrand for what<br>it's worth<br>campus watch is 98 approval rating in<br>the 2018 staff and student survey<br>was and still is a record for the most<br>positively reviewed service on the otago<br>campus so when it comes to it<br>campus watch is really really useful to<br>the vast majority of staff and students<br>i suppose you did help my maid bet<br>ah how is sammy doing these days still<br>won't eat spicy noodles<br>still can't drink goon and so her<br>journey to adulthood<br>is complete thanks in part to campus<br>watch<br>so no matter the situation campus watch<br>is there to help you feel a little safer<br>live a little easier isn't that right<br>sir proctor dave scott sir<br>that's right mark uh please don't call<br>me sir we're not the police<br>you're right dave we're not the police<br>we're campus watch<br>and we're here to make sure you get the<br>most out of your time<br>could you please leave oh yeah<br>first year it's quite busy and it's just<br>different to high school<br>so you learn to become more organized<br>and more independent so it's like a<br>study<br>and social life balance and also sleep<br>as well the environment really sort of<br>aids and helps you in your learning the<br>people here are so welcoming like you<br>can just go up to them ask them<br>questions and they're<br>always available to help you the amount<br>of stuff i learned on<br>the first day was when i realized this<br>is really something big this is<br>something special and this<br>i need to say welcome to maddie welcome<br>maddie uh maddie is from our social<br>impact studio so of course the first<br>question to you is what is the social<br>impact studio<br>well the social impact studio is the<br>place where we channel<br>all the energy passion and creativity<br>that students have and we put it towards<br>all the good stuff so we have lots of<br>programs where<br>um we've got silverline which is a<br>mental health and wellbeing initiative<br>that we run so a group of students are<br>just challenging the struggle of what<br>mental health can be like<br>and the challenges that are unique to<br>otago<br>and then we have uni crew which is our<br>volunteering group and we go out into<br>the community<br>and that's all about connecting with the<br>community developing your leadership<br>skills<br>and life skills and just finding a<br>belonging and a place<br>at this place as we often are new to<br>otago<br>can you give me a you mentioned uni crew<br>can you give us an example of uh a sort<br>of project that unicrew would do<br>yeah so tomorrow actually we have our<br>thing called feel good friday<br>so um works both ways the volunteers are<br>going to feel good and the community<br>organizations that we go out to are<br>going to feel good as well um so we're<br>going out to places like the sinclair<br>wetlands<br>stock otago out on the peninsula red<br>cross<br>presbyterian support otago<br>shop on carroll i think they're going to<br>a food bank as well so you've got about<br>i think 90 to 100 students going out<br>tomorrow out in the community<br>and why do students do this i mean it's<br>obviously a very good thing to do<br>it does make them more employable<br>doesn't it because it shows that they're<br>willing to give something back<br>um what other reasons might students<br>have for getting involved um i think it<br>is that drive to find a community as<br>yeah as i said before most of us are new<br>here in a new community so you don't<br>know<br>anyone past your halls so it's a good<br>way of making friends yeah<br>great way to make friends and just<br>connect yeah to a wider community and<br>just have a bit more purpose to<br>then just studying and yeah going out on<br>the weekends<br>so how can students get involved um so<br>when they come onto campus<br>they can either come see us at the<br>studio we have a little studio on campus<br>and then they can also just sign up on<br>our website unicrew oh i could actually<br>double check that but you'll find it on<br>the website<br>um but yeah just and we also have like<br>instagram and facebook so you can just<br>find unicorn otago or<br>silverline otago and we also have the<br>leadership award as well so you can<br>google that up as well<br>wonderful thank you very much yes so<br>it's a wonderful thing to get involved<br>with and if you do have any questions<br>about this or anything else that you've<br>seen<br>so far of course you can do it in the<br>live chat get online and ask us some<br>questions we'll be answering questions<br>until 7 30 this evening<br>so there's plenty of time for you to<br>have a browse have an explore<br>and follow some of the things that might<br>be peaking your interest<br>so thank you very much maddie thank you<br>for a real<br>pleasure now you said earlier that you<br>came from auckland<br>is that right yep you did correct so<br>what was it like you coming to dunedin<br>from a city that's much larger in the<br>north island<br>uh yeah i guess it was uh i don't know i<br>guess in auckland i don't come from the<br>city so it was still felt pretty big i<br>guess<br>um but yeah it was quite overwhelming<br>but it was a good<br>a good change i think um and yeah what<br>would be your favorite thing about<br>living in dunedin<br>uh the community i suppose through being<br>with the social impact studio definitely<br>had more exposure to the wider dunedin<br>community and it's just such a<br>close-knit lovely little community and i<br>love it so much here thank you so much<br>maddie much appreciated<br>so thank you maddie for joining us and<br>we'll be back after this ad break<br>what i love the most about being in<br>otago is just the<br>sense of community it's more to do with<br>the people i think everyone's very<br>open-minded<br>there's a sense that everybody's sort of<br>in this together we're willing to help<br>out our mates and kind of<br>all make sure that we get through it<br>together i want to go to a place that<br>was differently<br>student orientated a place that you<br>could grow up get a world-class degree<br>you might be nervous initially but you<br>will find a place here that's the great<br>thing about this university you will<br>so now we're going to talk about student<br>health now student health provides a<br>whole wide range of primary<br>health care to our students and in the<br>studio here we have ashley so welcome<br>ashley<br>thank you so you know i've just<br>mentioned student health so you know<br>what the first question is going to be<br>tell us a little bit more please about<br>what student health does for students<br>uh so student health is the overall<br>primary health care provider for our<br>students here<br>and so we're not a member of the primary<br>health organisation so<br>students who come from all over new<br>zealand and internationally can use<br>their services<br>without having to unenroll from their<br>gps at home<br>and it provides them with a full range<br>of primary health care<br>needs from doctors to nurses<br>and also a mental health and wellbeing<br>team which<br>provides excellent mental health and<br>wellbeing care<br>and yeah it's provides<br>a full range of primary healthcare so<br>acutely unwell<br>long-term conditions um management um<br>as well as different things like travel<br>so yeah wonderful thank you tell us a<br>little bit about the cost of it<br>because i know it's different from a<br>regular gp clinic in the community<br>yes so um cost wise uh it's very<br>it's quite a cost-effective service for<br>students so if you have a community<br>services card my services cost around<br>ten dollars<br>uh first mental health and wellbeing<br>team appointment<br>is usually free and then subsequent ones<br>are ten dollars and then<br>there's some variation on other services<br>if you're needing travel advice um<br>medicals and those types of things<br>um and international students have<br>um subsidised costs under the<br>student savings or insurance as well so<br>excellent that's really good to know<br>that international students are also<br>very well looked after so that's<br>thank you thank you very much for that<br>and uh where is student health located<br>uh so we're on wall street so right by<br>the main library so<br>nice and handy to campus yeah<br>excellent thank you now you um and<br>student health is not an academic<br>side of the university it's part of<br>maybe sort of student services or<br>something like that<br>what advice would you have for students<br>to look after themselves and their<br>well-being when they're here<br>so access their services definitely<br>when you're unwell or just needing<br>advice<br>we have plenty of information<br>on our website as well in terms of<br>management of<br>various common illnesses um but yeah<br>just<br>make the most of your time at university<br>keep yourself well<br>and i'm sure everyone's probably<br>familiar with all the covert<br>19 information good hand hygiene<br>rest excellent look after yourselves<br>you've some you've summarized a phrase<br>that i hear<br>quite a bit from the academic side of<br>the university and that successful<br>students<br>seek support yeah did you get successful<br>students seek support<br>you know why we say that firstly because<br>it's true and secondly because we like<br>alliteration here sometimes<br>so thank you very much for reiterating<br>that that's really important message for<br>students to hear<br>did you study at otago i studied at<br>otago politics and i've done<br>postgraduate study through otago<br>university as well<br>excellent wonderful well thank you so so<br>much for coming in it is much<br>appreciated<br>we really like hearing what you've got<br>to say<br>and so coming up next we have a<br>commercial break<br>getting in the city is just so friendly<br>it's a big city it's a big student city<br>i love that you can walk everywhere and<br>that everything's accessible<br>the campus is just pretty much in the<br>heart of the city as well<br>what the students offer to the city is<br>something that you don't get too many<br>other places<br>that's the great thing about this<br>university you will find your people<br>it feels like a university with a city<br>attached to it<br>it's exceeded my expectations in every<br>way it's unbelievable<br>hello and welcome to the table jack<br>manning jack is the<br>president of the otago university<br>students association or ousa<br>um so mr president welcome aboard thank<br>you very much um and you know i've got<br>some questions for you<br>absolutely so let's let's go first tell<br>us what ousa<br>is and then what it does for sure so our<br>usa is the otago university<br>student association so first and<br>foremost we are a student union<br>uh membership is free and you have it<br>from the second you join the university<br>to the second you leave<br>we've been around for 130 years and a<br>lot of people sometimes get this<br>impression when they first move here<br>that we are like a university department<br>that is the furthest thing from the<br>truth we are wholly owned and led by<br>students so first and foremost what that<br>looks like is representation and<br>advocacy so<br>we provide that on a myriad of<br>university committees the university<br>council<br>but we also do that on a national scale<br>so we<br>represent students and their interests<br>here at otago we also provide a bunch of<br>different services<br>um including the student support<br>service that we provide that is very<br>well taken up<br>and is always accessible to every<br>student so make sure to bookmark its<br>location when you get down here<br>we also run clubs and societies we have<br>over 150 student lead clubs and<br>societies for you to participate in<br>uh but we also have so much of a<br>presence on campus from the student<br>magazine critic<br>to radio one to um even a brand new<br>starters bar that we've just uh that we<br>just got a few years ago<br>so we're all over campus and you can't<br>miss us<br>that's i i totally agree with that it's<br>absolutely true um i<br>think that student voice is quite valued<br>here at otago would you agree with that<br>yeah i think so yeah it's something<br>which uh<br>really i think is a benchmark for the<br>success of an institution<br>is really how much it can value and<br>action student voice uh it's something<br>which<br>is in student politics is a buzzword but<br>at the end of the day what it really<br>means is<br>how how much is something how much is<br>the<br>elements of your university career not<br>set in stone how much of it can you<br>change how much of it<br>can you organize with students to change<br>and what<br>improvements can you make on your<br>university career whilst you're there<br>but also for people who are going to be<br>there after you<br>so tell me thank you tell me a little<br>bit about your role as president um<br>firstly<br>i've got to know you're the president is<br>your office oval<br>no it is not sadly it is it is square oh<br>okay yeah so what what is your role the<br>president involved<br>well um first and foremost i i lead the<br>it's an elected position so i lead the<br>other elected<br>representatives on the student exec who<br>sit on all sorts of committees<br>and run all sorts of initiatives on<br>campus uh but also<br>throughout the city and throughout the<br>country uh we also<br>um i'm also i suppose the chief<br>representative for all the students at<br>the university<br>and i lead the governance of ousa<br>just helping set the direction for<br>the services that we'll provide the<br>initiatives that we'll get into<br>and really the student issues that we<br>will um really try to action<br>this year cool thank you so what would<br>be your advice<br>for students coming into first year oh<br>there's far too much far too many points<br>to give you<br>three bullet points but i'll give you<br>yeah i'll give you the simplest ones<br>firstly pack an extra hoodie<br>um second do not sign a flat till first<br>semester<br>um often people get this idea they get<br>down here and they panic and want to<br>sign a flat as soon as they can<br>i can't recommend that against that<br>enough take as much time as you can<br>get to know the people you want to live<br>with uh but then i guess the final thing<br>really is<br>um don't be afraid to sort of redefine<br>yourself and really<br>um you know get into all sorts of new<br>things and find completely new friends<br>while you're here you know<br>when i first got to university i was an<br>incredibly shy person i was kind of a<br>ghost<br>um but it took me going to university to<br>really<br>sit broaden my horizons and learn new<br>things and meet new people<br>and i really wouldn't have gotten to<br>where i am today if it weren't for

support and prevention<br>centre for those<br>students who have experienced sexual<br>violence for support<br>and then also prevention just for the<br>general student body as well so<br>our prevention work is around building<br>skills about bystander intervention and<br>healthy relationships and things like<br>that<br>and we're sort of based on the best<br>evidence research out there<br>at the moment in the world as well so<br>we're very um yeah conscious of getting<br>the best things possible for students<br>excellent thank you now i know you<br>launched a program called before it<br>starts<br>yeah um could you tell us a little bit<br>about that and what that<br>looks like from the student's point of<br>view absolutely so um before it starts<br>um was a campaign that we um developed<br>with the marketing department here<br>um to encourage students to be able to<br>step in when they see things<br>that aren't maybe quite right and so<br>they want to maybe make a comment about<br>that and<br>sort of yeah address that behavior so we<br>ran<br>focus groups with a lot of students and<br>got sort of the best ideas from them<br>about<br>what was relevant and what was sort of<br>applicable to their<br>everyday experiences um yeah being on<br>campus here<br>and in general and dunedin as well so um<br>i'll hold one up for you to<br>have a look at um so these launched um<br>yeah just this month i think earlier<br>this month so it's really exciting to<br>have them out there and<br>they'll sort of be placid all over<br>campus which is really great<br>that's wonderful to see i think it's<br>just an absolutely fantastic<br>way that we support students especially<br>students who might have suffered a<br>traumatic<br>are you able to tell us what what you<br>know where else might students go<br>for support if they're feeling unsafe<br>yeah so um we work with a lot of um<br>departments around organizations on<br>campus as well so<br>um you saw a video about um campus watch<br>and the proctor's office uh student<br>health are really great we work with<br>them a lot<br>and just disability information and<br>support as well<br>we work with really closely um just to<br>ensure that students can get that<br>sort of holistic um support and um<br>package around them<br>yeah to lead to the best outcomes yeah<br>and i gather that at the<br>start of the year you had a presence in<br>the residential colleges<br>yeah absolutely so one of our key<br>prevention programs is<br>a consent workshop that's based in the<br>colleges at otago<br>so we yeah work really closely with the<br>colleges and first years coming to<br>dunedin so that we can you know set what<br>we want the expectations to be on campus<br>as a community and those are really<br>developed in collaboration with students<br>as well so that everyone's on the same<br>page<br>wonderful thank you so much uh thank you<br>for joining us rachel really appreciate<br>it and hearing what you've got to say<br>so we'll be back after this ad break<br>with careers<br>so our careers development center is a<br>one-stop shop for all career advice<br>for students and also for employers<br>students can

kindly summarized<br>what they do<br>simply going to your classes is not<br>going to be<br>enough it's about creating opportunities<br>and seeking opportunities outside of<br>what is in university<br>the career development centre is here<br>for all students at otago<br>both undergraduate and postgraduate and<br>it's our aim<br>to assist them with career decision<br>making they gave

things discussed<br>at those employer presentations<br>that will just be beneficial to the<br>students the career development center<br>helped me prepare for interviews and<br>also with the<br>year-long project that i did with them<br>it gave me good management skills<br>they're really willing to talk to us and<br>see what we wanted to do<br>after university and what we were<br>looking for<br>in a job just by talking to someone<br>about what you like what you dislike<br>will eventually help you think about<br>those things yourself<br>i learned how to make myself look like i<br>fit into the job description that i'm<br>applying for and how i fit into the<br>company values<br>i would say come in straight away and<br>just see what's out there they just<br>really help

we<br>are science at otago<br>say<br>well you've heard us talk about student<br>voice and how we value it so we've got<br>some students who are going to<br>share their voices with you please<br>welcome we've got georgia we've got<br>thomas we've got cam<br>and we have got jack so welcome along<br>folks<br>uh thomas we're gonna start with you uh<br>your question is<br>tell us a bit about why you chose to<br>come to otago<br>uh so i chose otago i came to hands-on<br>in my year 13 and i just really really<br>loved the student vibes that i found in<br>the city<br>i mean the uni is really good for my<br>course as well i'm a geography student<br>and i really love it but i think for me<br>the whole<br>sense of community and to me in dunedin<br>and the student vibe was really why i<br>picked dunedin<br>yeah excellent thank you so you do<br>geography so you really know where it's<br>at<br>yes yes i know that's so lame i'm going<br>to pass them<br>over to jack jack can you what would be<br>the<br>typical day in the life of jack at otago<br>oh it's pretty cruisy at the moment i'm<br>not gonna lie<br>um i'm in my fourth and final year so<br>i'm just doing three papers this<br>semester<br>um and i've got fridays off which is an<br>added bonus as well um so<br>definitely i've um sort of engineered my<br>timetable so i have my mornings quite<br>packed because i studied best in the<br>mornings<br>and then had the afternoons off to you<br>know catch up on notes or go to the gym<br>or something else<br>yeah excellent tell us what you're<br>studying i'm doing a double major<br>marketing and accounting and a minor in<br>history<br>excellent so you're studying for a big<br>com is that right wonderful thank you<br>can we go to cam now um cam at<br>otago we pride ourselves on having<br>flexible options can you tell us a<br>little bit about your journey in<br>relation to the flexibility there please<br>oh kiona thank you for the question um<br>well i came to the university last year<br>doing health sciences first year i'm a<br>pacific student<br>family's from the cook islands and so it<br>was you know definitely tough<br>yeah won't lie health sci is quite tough<br>but<br>um i was able to change to a bachelor of<br>science this year i'm majoring in<br>anatomy minor in pacific studies<br>it's a really weird combination lots of<br>people say that you know why would you<br>study an sp in pacific studies<br>and that's because i found that i'm so<br>passionate about pacific health<br>and the university of otago allowed me<br>to<br>pursue those passions and pursue that<br>love for my people<br>that's really good to hear because when<br>i studied a long time ago<br>i've almost done it the other way around<br>and that my degree is an arts degree<br>with a little bit of science in there<br>from my health side first year yeah<br>that's really good to hear one<br>lovely story georgia hi um<br>i want to know what advice have you got<br>for first years who are coming to otago<br>next year<br>um well i think some really important<br>things i<br>sometimes talk to um some of my fellow<br>high school students back from<br>avonside girls um i tend to tell them<br>that google calendar is amazing it's<br>your best friend knowing where you want<br>to be<br>where you need to go and everything and<br>it can be a bit stressful and that just<br>can take some of that pressure off<br>another thing would be talking to people<br>who've done the course before<br>so if you're interested in science or<br>in general or whatever topic you really<br>want to look at it's really helpful to<br>actually<br>either contact lecturers or um possibly<br>friends that you have who've gone on to<br>do that it's really useful when i found<br>it i'm great for some of the courses i'm<br>doing even now<br>cool lovely what are you studying um i'm<br>doing neuroscience and psychology<br>um so lots of brains lots of brain fog a<br>lot of syllables in those words<br>so how did you find it when you're at<br>high school you'd end up in your year 13<br>you're choosing five subjects<br>maybe six out of about 20 and then you<br>come here there's like over 150 how do<br>you make that choice<br>for me it was a lot of trial and error<br>um well<br>i knew i liked science so i did science<br>in high school and then i um i did the<br>health science<br>first year course as well and i actually<br>thought well i actually really like<br>science so i'll continue with that<br>rather than going into some of those<br>professional courses<br>and that turned out really well for me i<br>tried a psychology paper in my second<br>semester<br>and yeah just loved it so carried on<br>with that<br>that's really good to hear because we've<br>heard a few health sciences stories you<br>know today we have the health science of<br>people on here so it's nice to hear that<br>it's a<br>useful course that can lead into a lot<br>of things so who he is from out of town<br>he is from out of dunedin<br>tell us where you're from and then pass<br>the microphone yeah i'm from<br>christchurch<br>i'm from a tiny little village in north<br>taranaki called uranui<br>okay okay can you tell us then sorry<br>if you come from a small village in the<br>north island you come to dunedin<br>okay today's not huge but it's a little<br>bit different isn't it so how did you<br>adjust to that<br>um for me it was really a big big change<br>but i<br>my hall was the smaller hall on campus<br>so it was all right i could sort of<br>slowly get used to living with more and<br>more people but really once you get down<br>to it you know there's heaps and heaps<br>of people in dunedin but really<br>you kind of find your own group and it's<br>kind of sticks around the same like<br>i know everyone in the geography group<br>and we kind of stick all together and we<br>know of everyone else like it's not<br>really that overwhelming<br>really yeah that's really good to hear<br>because we do have a lot of students<br>here<br>um i sat actually instant david lecture<br>theater there with a group of students<br>from orwaka<br>um in south otago and they sat there and<br>they think oh my goodness there's more<br>people in this lecture theater than<br>they're in my hometown<br>can tell us about you your journey to<br>denim where did you come from<br>so i was raised in hawke's bay hastings<br>went to karamoo high school oh<br>calum high school very good good good<br>great high school<br>that's a brilliant little plug shameless<br>plug in there excellent<br>jack i'm from really far away i'm from<br>omarou so yeah an hour north yeah yeah<br>from waitaki boys<br>why thank you boys fantastic and so when<br>did all of you stay in residential<br>colleges in your first year<br>yes okay what was your experience like<br>jack um toronto college wasn't<br>actually any of my choices so when i<br>found out i was in tarawa i was kind of<br>disappointed i don't even know where it<br>was<br>yeah but um i definitely mean something<br>with an open mind and it's probably<br>um the hall was sort of set up more for<br>flooding so it sort of set me up really<br>well for my second and third years<br>yeah so overall even though that was not<br>your number one choice did you have a<br>good time yes yeah no all the halls<br>offer the sort of the same experience<br>just in a different setup<br>so it's sort of definitely um<br>coming from omar i see a lot of people<br>come down that jordan just pick the<br>halls where all their friends go but<br>they've never lived at home before and<br>they're going into a hall of 500.<br>so sort of just looking around and sort<br>of finding the hole that best fits how<br>you want to starting<br>to live is probably a really good idea<br>that's really good advice thank you so<br>much<br>look thank you so much we are out of<br>time and we're going to go to commercial<br>break now so thank you so much for<br>coming in really appreciate it and we<br>love hearing your voice so keep speaking<br>up<br>definitely that initial arrival at my<br>college<br>was a moment that i always remember just<br>the nicest people and the nicest<br>environment and my room's<br>beautiful the colleges for me have been<br>the biggest thing they offer this<br>immense range of sort of tutorial<br>services<br>and really good pastoral care as well<br>the college is<br>home first and foremost they just do the<br>little things well<br>it's just different to anything else<br>you'd ever experienced<br>so that's us coming to the end of our uh<br>live<br>show um and thank you so much for tuning<br>in<br>i'm going to say a little bit now about<br>scholarships because that's actually my<br>role at the university<br>looking after undergraduate entrance<br>scholarships you know<br>for most people coming to university for<br>the first time you are entitled to apply<br>so you can do that from our website but<br>probably the best thing to do is to go<br>into the virtual expo today<br>and click on the scholarships section<br>and<br>look at another video of me sorry<br>and that will tell you how you can apply<br>and you can have more information there<br>so apply in july for scholarships that's<br>one of my my mottos that's going to be<br>finally thank you all for tuning in and<br>thank you you know to everyone<br>here in the crew in particular other<br>university staff members and students<br>for<br>coming along and sharing their voice<br>with us it's just fantastic<br>i really encourage you to look around<br>the expo uh<br>look at everything in there gather some<br>questions and share them in the live<br>chat<br>and get answers remember there's no such<br>thing as a silly question no matter you<br>know how unusual that might sound<br>to you we really look forward to seeing<br>you here next year<br>and i can promise you that you'll be<br>very well looked after and have a<br>fantastic experience so thank you very<br>much if you see me around campus come<br>and say kia ora<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
