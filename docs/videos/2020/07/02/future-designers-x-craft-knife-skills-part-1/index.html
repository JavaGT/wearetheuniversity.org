font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Kia ora, I hope you're enjoying challenge one and creating some pretty exciting windows.<br>I'm gonna talk about some craft<br>knife skills today.<br>First off, make sure you've got a cutting board so that you're not cutting straight onto the table.<br>If you don't have a cutting mat, just a normal kitchen chopping board works really well.<br>If you don't have a cutting board, several layers cardboard on top of each other<br>can still protect your table, you just have to be extra careful to make sure that it's not gonna cut through.<br>A couple tips today - first is how to hold your knife.<br>You really want to make sure that you're holding your knife nice and lightly<br>and that you're not putting too much pressure.<br>Now you've got two ways, some people hold it like this, which is great if you're doing long cuts<br>and the other is to hold it like a pin and that's great if you're doing really detailed curved cuts.<br>The biggest thing to think about is which part of the paper you're wanting.<br>So if I want this middle part, if I want that shape here, rather than the outside,<br>then I want to make sure all the lines that I'm cutting are gonna preserve this<br>interior shape as best as possible.<br>You really want to make sure once you've got your chopping board down,<br>is that you're not gonna cut yourself.<br>So if you start and you've got your thumb like this, when I get to here, I'm gonna cut my thumb.<br>It might seem obvious, in fact it seems really obvious, but the number of times<br>even myself, I've not realised that lined up and that tiny little bit of my thumb was<br>over and I get to that point, now most of the time I noticed before then,<br>but you just really don't want to slice your thumb.<br>So one of the tricks to do is put your blade on the line, push the top of your<br>ruler to that, that helps line it up, put your blade at the end of the line<br>and just rotate it, checking that my<br>fingers aren't over the edge.<br>And then, instead of starting right on the line, I'm actually gonna start over the line.<br>And the reason I'm doing that is it means I don't have any issues with<br>the ends of that shape not getting cut.<br>Now I'm rotating my piece of paper because it's easier to pull towards me.<br>Now, if I decide not to cut and not rotate and I line up my ruler and then I'm cutting<br>like this, I just don't have as much control because I'm not able to hold my blade as well.<br>Okay, so now I have a really nice cutout shape, all on the lines, in really nice sharp corners.<br>If I don't cut over I might not get as tidy corners.<br>If I want the outside of the piece of paper, I can't cut over and so there's a few tricks to that.<br>So again, I line up my blade and my roller on the line making sure that it's all nice<br>and straight and then just starting at the edge of the line and just go into the corner.<br>Next, so this is good, but oh the corners<br>aren't quite loose, that one's still a bit<br>stuck, so the tip here is if you've got a corner that's not quite right, you just line<br>up your blade and just push down and that should give you a really nice tidy corner.<br>Doing curves often requires a bit of freehand.<br>Now you can use things like French curves to help you here and that means<br>that you can line up where the lines match and run your blade along those edges<br>and notice I'm just holding the blade in its same place and that means you always<br>get it lined up and then you look for your next part that matches.<br>Keep going now, the trick, one of the tricks here is to keep your blade really<br>light, because the more you push in, the less control you have over it.<br>You might be doing it freehand, just go really slowly.<br>Now you can see that pulling there, that's because I'm pushing a little bit too hard,<br>so I'm gonna lighten my blade a little bit.<br>I'm having to turn a little bit too much so I'm going to turn my paper again.<br>You're just going really nice and slowly and if you kind of get, like it feels like it's<br>getting away from you, you just pause and turn your paper again and if you begin<br>to push too hard, you can just lighten your hold a little bit.<br>With a circle, one of the key things is to be light, very gently going around making<br>sure you're following that line, slowing down, turning your paper.<br>But, honestly, scissors is the way to go.<br>So don't underestimate your scissors, it's much easier, again I like to turn my paper rather than the scissors.<br>And that actually creates a bit of a smoother cut.<br>So taking your time and using the tools that you've got.<br>We hope you have a lot of fun making your window displays.<br>We're really looking forward to seeing them.<br>So make sure that you get them in before the 1st of July or on the 1st of July<br>using the hashtag #futuredesignersNZ.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
