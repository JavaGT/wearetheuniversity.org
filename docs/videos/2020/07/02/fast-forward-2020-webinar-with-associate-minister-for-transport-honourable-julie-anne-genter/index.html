Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, <br>tēnā tatou katoa. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou.<br>It's really lovely to be <br>able to speak to all of you,  <br>if somewhat unfortunate that I can't <br>be in the same room and see all of you.<br>Hopefully, we can still have an interesting <br>discussion and while I will start with a bit  <br>of a presentation, I do really want to <br>be sure there's plenty of time to answer  <br>questions and direct the conversation in <br>an area that you would be interested in.<br>As Lee said, I actually came to New Zealand <br>to do my masters in what was then Planning  <br>Practice at the University of Auckland and is <br>now the Masters of Urban Planning I believe.<br>And before that, I studied <br>politics and economics in France,  <br>and I'd studied philosophy and <br>other things in the United States,<br>and one of the key questions or things that <br>motivated me to study urban planning was  <br>that I really wanted to have a career where <br>I could make a positive and creative impact  <br>and where I could help solve some of what <br>I saw as the biggest challenges facing us<br>like climate change, environmental <br>degradation, and getting better equality,  <br>better outcomes for all people in our communities,<br>and I saw urban planning as a really fascinating <br>and interesting discipline that started to look  <br>right across a lot of different areas and where <br>we could potentially get much better outcomes<br>- environmentally, socially, <br>from a public health perspective,  <br>and even from an economic perspective.<br>So, I'll just share some slides <br>out hopefully this will work and  <br>apologies if it doesn't because this <br>is the first time I've shared slides.<br>So, hopefully, what you can see here <br>is a - what I think is quite a useful  <br>encapsulation of the difference <br>between equality versus equity,<br>and equity is something that I think we need <br>to be aiming for, not just in the design of our  <br>buildings, but in the design of all the different <br>aspects of our public life and our civic life.<br>In the first, if you give everyone the exact same  <br>thing not everybody has the same <br>opportunities to live a good life<br>because people are born with different abilities <br>and different physical characteristics,  <br>so it's really important in the <br>design of our towns and cities  <br>that we're thinking about ways to maximize <br>the ability of everyone to have a fair go.<br>And I particularly focused on transportation <br>during my masters in Planning because I  <br>saw that as an area where if we did <br>things differently we could get much,  <br>much better outcomes from an <br>equality - an equity point of view.<br>See if this changes.<br>So, the sorts of places that I think <br>people are inevitably attracted to  <br>are ones that are designed <br>around people and, you know,<br>when you create these spaces, as we used to have <br>in all of our towns and cities, this is where  <br>the commerce flocks to, this is where people <br>go to engage in socialising and shopping and  <br>recreation and it's often places where they work <br>and where some people would really like to live.<br>This is Christchurch. We don't have - <br>in New Zealand - many places like this  <br>in our towns and cities and we certainly <br>didn't when I first moved to New Zealand<br>because most of our public spaces in our towns <br>or cities had been given over to cars and trucks,  <br>and that inevitably kind of drove people out <br>of the city centre and they tended to flock  <br>to other car-free spaces like shopping <br>malls - out of centre shopping malls.<br>And I think there's a real renaissance of the <br>city and a desire for people to get back there,  <br>and that's something that we absolutely <br>can support, but we will need to take a  <br>different approach to both our urban <br>planning rules and our transportation  <br>policy if we're going to support these sort <br>of urban people-friendly environments that  <br>reduce the need to rely on private <br>vehicles for so many of our trips.<br>And so, in transportation, there's <br>really kind of two big areas.<br>One is passenger trips and those are the trips  <br>that people are taking to get <br>to school, to work, around town.<br>And then there's freight, and freight is <br>a pretty big and important question in  <br>New Zealand particularly for our <br>exports which tend to be coming  <br>from parts of the country where there <br>isn't a huge amount of infrastructure.<br>You know, if you're thinking dairy in <br>Southland or forestry on the East Coast.<br>So, freight is something that we do have to look <br>at as how we can reduce our carbon emissions and  <br>reduce pollution from freight, and I think <br>there we have a great opportunity as well.<br>And as I alluded to earlier, what I <br>found most interesting when I was doing  <br>my research for my Masters in Planning was <br>that, contrary to a lot of the assumptions  <br>about why things are the way they are and <br>why in New Zealand people are so reliant  <br>on private vehicles to get most places, it's <br>not because planning hasn't been good enough,<br>it's actually because planning and traffic <br>engineering in the second half of the 20th  <br>century actually led us to this outcome, <br>unintentionally really created towns and  <br>cities that developed entirely around car <br>transport through some of the planning rules,<br>which separated zones and said, you <br>know, you've got to have residential  <br>separate from commercial separate from <br>- so people don't live where they work.<br>In transportation planning which <br>really entirely focused on car  <br>journeys and truck journeys as opposed <br>to what is the best way to offer people  <br>opportunities to move around and what is <br>the best way for goods to move around.<br>And inevitably, what we know now - and this <br>wasn't unique to New Zealand. This happened  <br>in everywhere but especially it came out <br>of North America - the United States,  <br>Canada. You can even see that the UK has more <br>car-oriented planning despite having much older  <br>cities than some of their neighbours in Europe <br>who maybe changed tack a little bit sooner.<br>So, Australia and New Zealand, similar to <br>North America and similar to, you know,  <br>for all those English-speaking countries, you <br>know, chose a particular way of defining the  <br>problem and solving it that inevitably leads to <br>widening of roads, more provision of parking,  <br>trying to reduce traffic jams at peak time, trying <br>to reduce competition for on-street car parking,<br>and what this inevitably does is create a <br>situation where you have to use a car to  <br>get anywhere, and you end up having more traffic, <br>and you're constantly in this cycle of thinking,  <br>"oh, if only we just widen this road, <br>we would alleviate peak congestion."<br>But, 50 years of research from North American <br>cities - and you'd see the same in New Zealand  <br>and Australia - is pretty, it's very definitive <br>that you can't build your way out of congestion.<br>What is missing in the design of our towns <br>and cities and transportation system has been  <br>a real focus on the safety and convenience of <br>trips by bicycle, on foot, by public transport,<br>and when we start to provide for those <br>missing modes then more people will  <br>use them and there'll be less pressure on the <br>roading network that we've already developed.<br>And of course, despite improvements in vehicle <br>technology, New Zealand is lagging behind in terms  <br>of not having vehicle emission standards or any <br>sort of taxes or incentives to buy cleaner cars<br>- by 'cleaner' I mean less carbon <br>emissions, carbon-intensive cars -<br>and because our car ownership is <br>quite high and has been increasing,<br>we've seen from about 2013 a <br>big increase in our transport  <br>emissions at a time when we're <br>meant to be reducing emissions.<br>So, from a climate perspective, transport <br>becomes incredibly important because,  <br>as some of you may know, about half of <br>our greenhouse gas emissions are from  <br>agriculture and the other <br>half are carbon emissions.<br>And about 40% of our carbon emissions <br>are from transport, and more than half  <br>of all of those - about 60% - the majority are <br>from light cars, you know: cars, utes, vans.<br>The light vehicles in our fleet, they're not <br>- I mean heavy vehicles are about over 20%,<br>so we need to take some pretty drastic action <br>to change that over the next 10 years if we  <br>have any hope of meeting our commitments under <br>the Paris Agreement and keeping our - doing  <br>our part to keep warming below 1.5 degrees, <br>which most the world has already agreed to.<br>And many of you might already know, you know,  <br>these decisions that were made a long time ago <br>in Auckland around Spaghetti Junction when we  <br>were prioritizing just getting vehicles <br>from the suburbs into the city centre,<br>inevitably that creates severance and it makes it <br>more difficult for people to make relatively short  <br>journeys, say, by bicycle, because they're <br>having to compete with all this traffic.<br>There's no dedicated infrastructure for them <br>and so you'll find - it's really intriguing.<br>I saw that a data analyst who I know published <br>a bit of an analysis of trips within Auckland,  <br>and although you might expect that people driving <br>to the city centre would be coming from far away,<br>in fact, I think far more, <br>disproportionately, people  <br>who are driving to the city centre are people <br>who live in those inner suburbs like Remuera,  <br>Saint Mary's Bay, Herne Bay, Ponsonby, <br>who are very high-income and who are  <br>likely to be provided a free car park <br>by their employer in the Central City.<br>So, those are journeys that you would <br>think can be made pretty easily by public  <br>transport or by e-bike now, but because <br>we don't really have the infrastructure,  <br>public transport still isn't as convenient and <br>ultimately driving is a very easy option for  <br>people on high incomes or who are provided <br>a free car park in their place of work.<br>Those are the people who are <br>driving, and of course, again,  <br>that vicious cycle of - as long as lots of <br>people are driving, there's heavy traffic,  <br>there isn't dedicated infrastructure for <br>the alternatives then that puts people off  <br>actually trying the alternatives, <br>and you end up with congestion.<br>And this slide here is Botany, out in <br>Auckland, and I think it's almost the  <br>quintessential outcome of the 1950s to 1970s <br>planning and traffic engineering paradigm.<br>This is the outcome you get, where you <br>can see the vast majority of what's  <br>in the picture is used for - is land <br>being used to move or store vehicles.<br>Probably worth noting at this point that the <br>off-street car parks you see around this big box  <br>retail, this sort of development is a necessary <br>outcome from the planning rules themselves.<br>The planning rules would not enable a <br>type of development that we know would  <br>be far more amenable to people walking <br>cycling or taking public transport.<br>The minimum parking requirements require a huge,  <br>really, over provision of car parks <br>because you're planning for the peak,<br>and an off-street car park uses about 20 you know <br>much more land than a non-street car park would.<br>So, even if the car park was full you'd <br>still have at least twice the lands  <br>needed for storing the vehicles so that the <br>vehicles could circulate around the car park.<br>So, the outcome of this is an environment <br>where it's basically extremely unattractive  <br>or impractical for people to <br>do anything but drive a car.<br>The cost of this development <br>is higher because of all the  <br>lands that we've put aside for car parking.<br>It reduces the land that's available for <br>affordable housing which is something  <br>that is important to us, particularly in Auckland,<br>and ultimately, this, you could argue, <br>is not only a disaster for the climate,  <br>it's kind of a disaster economically<br>because even if we could replace all <br>of the cars in the picture with EVs,  <br>the cost of that is going to be very, very high,<br>and the cost of the land being <br>used simply to move in-store cars,  <br>as opposed to really and vitally <br>important uses like housing and  <br>other social infrastructure that's needed for <br>communities to flourish, is very, very high.<br>But, the great news is we can choose <br>to do all of this differently.<br>We don't have to force people out of their cars.<br>We do need to prioritise investment in  <br>alternatives so people can get out <br>of their cars when they want to.<br>And over the last 10 years, <br>I know that developments and  <br>public transport in Auckland have been quite good.<br>We've seen huge growth in public transport <br>use everywhere we've invested in it.<br>It has been - oh, hi. Sorry, this is <br>my son. He's just saying goodnight.<br>I want to design towns and cities for <br>people like him, not just so he grows up  <br>with a stable climate, but also that he has the <br>independence when he's 10 years old to be able to  <br>go out with his friends and get around without <br>having to rely on me driving him everywhere.<br>I think that's the kind of independence <br>that people took for granted in previous  <br>generations and that children today <br>are absolutely lacking in a physical  <br>environment like the one where we're <br>looking at right now in Botany.<br>Nobody could let their child go down <br>to the shops for them because they  <br>would have to cross incredibly dangerous <br>intersections with high volumes of traffic.<br>It would be a much longer walk because <br>there aren't shops provided really close  <br>to the houses because they're all spread <br>out because of the roads in the car parking.<br>And so, if - we have to <br>change something, basically.<br>And I guess, the other element of the equity <br>as a Minister for Women I do have to comment  <br>on is that transport networks have largely <br>been designed by adult men for adult men<br>and a more family-friendly and <br>inclusive approach to designing  <br>a transportation system wouldn't <br>uniquely focus on the commute trips,<br>but actually, the household trips <br>that women are more likely to make,  <br>the short trips within the community to go <br>do the shopping, to take the kids to school.<br>Ideally the men would be doing this too.<br>But again, this is why I see this just very much  <br>as the product of a framework <br>that was very mid-20th century,<br>and still there is a quite a gender <br>imbalance within the transportation side of,  <br>you know, transportation planning, traffic <br>engineering, is still very male-dominated,<br>although I think planning is is <br>a bit more diverse at this point.<br>So, no one in their right <br>mind - I mean, obviously,  <br>this girl is cycling, but it doesn't look <br>like a very nice environment for her.<br>She's all alone and unlikely to - this is why you <br>don't see a huge number of kids walking to cycle  <br>- cycling - walking and cycling to school anymore <br>as we did in previous decades is very much because  <br>the transportation system has been so focused on <br>cars and has led to higher volumes of traffic.<br>Understandable that families wouldn't <br>feel comfortable letting their kids  <br>walk and cycle to school on <br>their own in this environment.<br>And Māori and Pasifika kids are at higher risk <br>of being killed or injured by road traffic,<br>and you can see, particularly in Auckland, <br>in communities like South Auckland,  <br>there's fewer parks, there's <br>less public transport provision,  <br>and it's a far more car-oriented <br>design than Central Auckland.<br>And a big focus on the infrastructure <br>investment over the last decade,  <br>on improving cycleways and stuff, has been very <br>much on that central city and not the whole city,<br>and I think that we have to do a lot more to <br>ensure that we're focusing on investing in  <br>the communities who are disproportionately <br>impacted by the traffic that we have and by  <br>the transportation poverty that they have <br>because we haven't focused on delivering.<br>So, my biggest takeaway and many <br>of you may already know this,  <br>but - is people respond to the <br>environment that we create.<br>So, planners and engineers and politicians <br>have an enormous responsibility.<br>We don't have to force people out of their cars, <br>but we do have to provide a transportation system  <br>that is providing equity of access and <br>is creating the types of communities that  <br>are really going to serve our people, and <br>all of our people, not just some of them.<br>I did mention earlier - and I've slightly <br>lost track of time so I hope I'm not going  <br>over - that everywhere we have invested <br>in public transport, people are using it.<br>It's been more successful than forecast.<br>The northern busway is a really great example <br>of an incredibly efficient investment,<br>and I think it was 200 million at the time,  <br>and it's basically doubled the capacity of <br>the Auckland Harbour Bridge at peak times  <br>and has enabled much better access <br>for people who don't own vehicles.<br>And that's - I've come to the ends of my slides,  <br>so I will stop sharing. Or it's <br>frozen. I quite figured this out.<br>I'd be really interested in getting <br>into questions just to make sure that  <br>I'm addressing all the particular issues <br>that you the audience is interested in.<br>Thank you very much. It's being really, <br>really, interesting, really interesting stuff,<br>and I really like your comment and as <br>an urban designer and an urban planner,  <br>you know, we design communities.<br>Design for the car, that's what you get.<br>And I take your point. It's really good.<br>I'm gonna start. I've got three questions <br>here, but I'm gonna start with one question  <br>that I didn't say I was going to ask <br>you, but you made me think about this<br>- is that, in light of the scenario that we've <br>being in and lockdown and all the - all this,  <br>whatever you want to call what we've been through,<br>it seems to me there's a real opportunity here to  <br>return to the local and actually deliver on <br>a lot of these ideas about TODs, and live,  <br>work and play, and all types of things <br>in the walkable, catchable communities.<br>So, I'd be sort of interested in your role <br>as the Associate Minister of Transport  <br>is how we could give effect to this idea, <br>opposed to these - investing in these mega  <br>infrastructure projects that move people <br>from one side of the city to the other.<br>No disrespect to the engineers. <br>They love those types of projects.<br>But, as an urban designer, community <br>creation and how do we get back to the local,<br>I'd be interested in your thoughts on <br>where you think we can go to do that.<br>I think that's a really great point, Lee.<br>I think that our government has taken some <br>important first steps to enabling that,<br>and as I was talking a bit about <br>planning rules that have gotten  <br>in the way of more diverse compact development,<br>as long as I've been in New Zealand, the <br>planning documents have had a vision for  <br>walkable neighbourhoods with good public transport<br>and a variety of different activities within <br>walking distance of where people are living.<br>And yet, the rules that were kind of governing how  <br>development happened tended to prevent <br>that from actually being implemented.<br>And, you know, there were some positive <br>changes with the Auckland Unitary Plan,<br>but I think it didn't really go far enough.<br>And so, we have been working on <br>a National Policy Statement on  <br>Urban Development that does address some of <br>those barriers to that type of development,<br>and I think we've also been trying to <br>use the, you know, the national agencies,  <br>like the New Zealand Transport Agency, to <br>provide guidance and support to councils.<br>So, I think there'll be an announcement <br>about the final decisions on the National  <br>Policy Statement in the coming weeks, so that's <br>something you should definitely look out for.<br>The idea behind it is just to say, actually, <br>in the Town and Country Planning Act and the  <br>old-school approach to planning, there were <br>a whole bunch of rules, like minimum parking  <br>requirements, that just kind of got put in <br>place without any evidence to support them.<br>We know they've had really - their <br>impacts have not been what we want,<br>and for each council to try and <br>change those individual rules  <br>is really quite a huge hurdle and <br>quite - there's quite a big barrier.<br>In Auckland, when they tried to remove minimum <br>parking requirements from high-density zones the  <br>major retailers took them to court over <br>it and they ended up having to settle.<br>And the reason the major retailers <br>did this is because even though they  <br>themselves -and I'm talking like Sylvia <br>Park, the owners of Sylvia Park and some  <br>of the malls - they themselves would <br>apply for dispensation from these rules  <br>to provide huge numbers of car parks when <br>they wanted to expand their floor space.<br>But, basically, they sort of saw <br>that it was a bit of a threat to  <br>their business because the malls <br>thrive on this car-oriented model,<br>and if in the high-density zones <br>people retailers were able to set  <br>up smaller shops without putting in place car <br>parking, which is kind of the point, right?<br>Because we want them within walking distance  <br>of these new higher density <br>townhouses and apartments.<br>Well, the major retailers just <br>knew that that would be a bit  <br>of a threat to their business <br>models, so they were saying,<br>"don't regulate us on anything, Council. Except,  <br>you definitely need to tell us <br>how many car parks to provide,<br>and you should definitely tell us to provide more <br>than we've actually argued to you we need to."<br>So, not to dwell too much on the parking <br>rules, but I do think that they have been  <br>one of the biggest drivers of the shape of <br>our urban development over the last 50 years.<br>So, it was a bit of a barrier for councils to <br>make that change and I'm hoping with this new  <br>national guidance that it will really kind <br>of be a bit of a circuit breaker on that,<br>and support councils to actually have the type <br>of development that they say that they want.<br>And then, of course, we have to pair <br>that with some guidance from, you know,  <br>something like the national trans- you know, <br>the New Zealand Transport Agency saying,<br>"here's best practice management for car <br>parking and we're going to support you to  <br>take a more management approach, as opposed to <br>just regulating an oversupply of car parking."<br>And another area where that's true is <br>with the tactical urbanism funds that  <br>we've developed at the NZTA so that's <br>also trying to overcome a barrier.<br>You - I imagine many of you <br>know about tactical urbanism.<br>This is using, like, very low-cost materials <br>like brightly coloured paint to the street  <br>furniture and pot plants and things like that <br>to take over space that has previously been,  <br>you know, street space for the movement <br>of cars or even on-street car parking,<br>and turning it into more of a people-oriented <br>place, and trialling it quickly and taking the  <br>learning you get from, that the data you get from <br>that, and kind of having a fast fail approach.<br>So, you can sort of trial it, see <br>how it goes, and expand it or not,<br>and this was one of the ways that <br>Manhattan quite quickly transformed  <br>some of their really busy traffic areas <br>into big public plazas that then ended up  <br>becoming permanent or pedestrianised <br>areas in Times Square, for example.<br>And we found that councils were <br>really struggling to put in place,  <br>you know, extended footpaths, or separated <br>cycleways, or little public plaza spaces,<br>because, firstly, they'd have massive <br>consultation requirements and inevitably,  <br>anytime you present - propose any change to <br>the street environment, somebody gets really  <br>upset about it and argues that it's going to <br>be the death of their commercial district.<br>And also, it sort of meant that <br>transport planning has been very  <br>kind of theory-based as opposed to empirical.<br>So, you get the whole community debating <br>like some pictures on a paper but not  <br>really getting to experience it <br>in real life and see how it works,  <br>collect data before you make these <br>big long permanent decisions.<br>And so, there have been streets like Ponsonby <br>Road and Dominion Road that we've been talking  <br>about upgrading for, like, over a decade <br>and it's - nothing has really happened.<br>And so, it's just very high stakes.<br>It's like you have to get it all perfect before <br>you do anything and then, you know, that prevents  <br>us from doing things quickly, getting the <br>community to be able to see how it will change,<br>and so the shopkeepers can see, "okay, well, <br>actually people still came to my shop even  <br>though these three car parks right in front <br>of it were not there for a month or two."<br>So, I think that that approach, again, <br>a big council like Auckland Council has  <br>their resources, you know, through the <br>Auckland Design Office they did anyway,  <br>and Auckland Transport has the resources <br>to have specialists in this area.<br>But, outside of Auckland Councils aren't as <br>well-resourced, and so we're trying to get the  <br>New Zealand Transport Agency to develop <br>that guidance to have - for this fund,  <br>the board has signed off a 90% <br>subsidy, which is really exciting,  <br>which means that councils have a real <br>incentive to trial this new approach.<br>And we had to get around that requirement, this <br>onerous requirement for all this consultation.<br>If we're just doing temporary changes, we need <br>to have a way to do that so we can gather data,<br>rather than having to go out and <br>do six weeks of consultation for  <br>something which ended up becoming a <br>major barrier to doing anything at all.<br>I'm just gonna - thank you very much <br>for that. I'm just gonna pick up some  <br>questions from the floor and <br>then I'll come back myself.<br>I've got one here from Antony that says,  <br>"what are your views on the current in-draft <br>Government Policy Statement on Transport?"<br>Well, I think the current Government Policy <br>Statement on Transport Funding was pretty good.<br>It was - it signalled a big change in <br>direction because a lot of the really  <br>big projects in the new state highways category,  <br>in particular, were things that have <br>to be contracted years in advance.<br>We weren't able to redirect as much in <br>the initial three year NLTF to public  <br>transport and rapid transit and even walking <br>as cycling as I personally would have liked.<br>But, we still did signal <br>a big change in direction.<br>In the draft, I think it's probably the first  <br>three years that are the <br>most important to look at,<br>and once you go further out it starts to be, <br>you know, who knows what's going to happen  <br>with Covid 19 - I think I didn't quite get back <br>to that, Lee, in answer to your first question.<br>It did show us how quickly big changes <br>can be made for the good of the community,<br>and I think that during lockdown level four, which <br>was probably very challenging for some people,<br>many also experienced the benefits of having <br>quieter neighbourhoods, reduced traffic,  <br>people being able to get out on their bikes <br>with families on their bikes and feel safe,<br>and seeing lots and their neighbours out and about <br>from a distance was kind of nice, as you say.<br>And so, I think that kind of opened <br>up a window in which we could see,  <br>actually, we could do things differently <br>and it could bring us some huge benefits.<br>And with climate change in particular, I think <br>the work of the Climate Commission is going to  <br>be instrumental and that budgeting is going to <br>be really important across all different sectors,<br>but I already have heard from the Chair of <br>the Climate Commission and other experts  <br>that transport is going to have to, you know, <br>pull a lot of the weight in the next 10 years,<br>and so that might mean that we have to make even  <br>bigger changes to our funding <br>priorities and with Covid 19,  <br>also we're obviously borrowing and committing <br>a lot of funding to stimulate the economy,<br>and so that's going to potentially <br>limit us, you know, in five years times,<br>so we have to be really careful about <br>what we choose to prioritise in the  <br>next 18 months because it's going to <br>have repercussions for the next decade.<br>And just picking up that point we were discussing <br>before about the shovel-ready projects and the 11  <br>fast-track projects, what - were you involved and <br>was there any - do you have any insights to the  <br>rationale of why those projects were chosen <br>vis-a-vis what we've just been discussing?<br>So, the projects that have already been announced <br>as being potentially able to go through the  <br>fast-track process - I mean, that legislation <br>is still in front of the Select Committee.<br>So, just for those who aren't total <br>parliament nerds, the way that it  <br>works for the bill to become a law <br>is it has to have a first reading,  <br>go to a select committee - I believe there's <br>going to be hearings on that bill all day  <br>tomorrow - and then it would have to go <br>through a second and a third reading.<br>And I would just say, the Greens <br>supported at the first reading,  <br>but we still have some pretty <br>big concerns about the approach.<br>I have a briefing here from the Ministry <br>for the Environment which talks about the  <br>prioritisation, or the criteria, that <br>were used to identify these projects,<br>and impact on climate was <br>certainly one of the criteria,<br>and the number of jobs that it <br>would create is another criteria,<br>and readiness to start construction <br>was a further criteria.<br>I assume that this briefing if <br>it's not already public will  <br>be proactively released in the next few months.<br>I wasn't directly involved in choosing projects, <br>but I would say that generally, I think that the  <br>assessment that was put forward by the Ministry <br>for the Environment was pretty good, and yeah.<br>Okay, cool. I've got another <br>question from the floor.<br>This one's from Rebecca. She says, <br>"what are your thoughts on the  <br>MOT's Green freight study's findings, <br>options, and actions, and timeframes?"<br>I think it's good... I think we need to be <br>moving a lot faster on it, to be honest.<br>But hey, we came into government, we really <br>changed direction from the previous government,  <br>and I think it took some - it <br>turns out once you get into  <br>government everything takes a lot <br>longer than you think it should,<br>but particularly if capacity within <br>the public service and the Ministry of  <br>Transport and the New Zealand Transport <br>Agency had all been geared up to kind  <br>of go in a slightly different direction, or a <br>completely different direction in some cases,<br>then it takes time to kind of build up the <br>capacity and the advice to do other things,<br>and you can't prioritise everything all at once.<br>While Green freight's really, <br>really important, I think,  <br>obviously, it's taken a backseat compared <br>to the work we had to do on the Government  <br>Policy Statement overall, some of the <br>work that we did on vehicle emissions.<br>I think I see an opportunity with <br>biofuels to reduce emissions,  <br>particularly from diesel and heavy vehicles.<br>Small - you can make small <br>reductions quite quickly<br>and you don't have to wait for new technology.<br>It's something you can drop in immediately.<br>But, you know, obviously, it's going to <br>take some time, and it can take up to 18  <br>months for a policy like that to work its <br>way through a normal legislative process.<br>Back in 2007, 2008, they were working on <br>a biofuels mandate and then the National  <br>government just canned that work <br>and nothing happened for nine years.<br>And then, you know, we're just <br>getting it on our work programme now.<br>I think mode shift for freight <br>is not completely unrealistic.<br>We are investing a lot in the rail network.<br>I know the minister of transport is <br>very passionate about coastal shipping,<br>but it's been less clear what we can do to <br>incentivise a shift to more coastal shipping,  <br>aside from you know when earthquakes knocked <br>out State Highway 1 and the rail line,  <br>there was a big shift to coastal <br>shipping quite quickly and it did work.<br>So, there's a question about how <br>we as a government can provide  <br>the right incentives to enable <br>momentum where that makes sense.<br>And then, the longer-term question around <br>technology is whether electrification of  <br>heavy vehicles or hydrogen is going to be the best <br>option - green hydrogen for those heavy vehicles,<br>and I think - I'm hopeful that in the next month <br>there will be some announcements about decisions  <br>for further infrastructure investment <br>that will show that we are very much  <br>committed to Green freight and some of the <br>opportunities will start in the next year.<br>Dare I ask the question about the <br>light rail down Dominion Road?<br>Well, I think there's going to be a <br>government announcement on that very,  <br>very soon which makes it difficult for <br>me to talk about it right now tonight.<br>What I can say is, obviously, for me and the Green <br>Party this was a high-priority project because  <br>it had already been well developed by Auckland <br>Transport and the New Zealand Transport Agency,<br>but that, you know, we're in a coalition <br>government and other parties wanted to  <br>investigate other alternatives like <br>full-grade separation for the line,<br>and that's what led to this sort of twin-track <br>process being pursued between New Zealand Infra,  <br>which is the super fund, and CDPQ from Quebec,<br>which would be like a kind of PPP - they're <br>calling it 'Public Public Partnership'<br>because it's the super fund and another kind of  <br>publicly owned investment agency <br>from another country, from Canada.<br>But, the idea was to set it up kind of <br>more like with that entity delivering the  <br>infrastructure and then kind of operating <br>it over a very long period of time,<br>and the alternative was a similar type of <br>proposal from the New Zealand Transport Agency.<br>So, that's I think why it has taken longer because  <br>some parties wanted to investigate <br>alternative approaches to delivery,<br>and I think that we will start to see a lot <br>of progress on that in the next few months,<br>and especially depending on <br>the outcome of the election.<br>I've got a question here from Ivan. He <br>says, "thank you very much. Really good  <br>problem definition. On the other hand, <br>how do you envision that we could improve  <br>Aotearoa's cities' resilience in making <br>them first peoples' places without huge  <br>economic investment and, most importantly, <br>with the support from the general public?"<br>I think that's the trickiest part is - I think <br>that there is strong public support for public  <br>transport, for more cycle-friendly and <br>pedestrian-friendly neighbourhoods,<br>but there's also inevitably loud <br>opposition to any proposed change,  <br>both to zoning that allows higher <br>density in some parts of the city,<br>and to reallocation of road space which is <br>necessary to provide priority for public  <br>transport and safe access for people who are <br>on active modes: walking, cycling, scooting.<br>So that's the big challenge and <br>when you ask people what they want,  <br>like post-Christchurch earthquakes, the <br>council ran this 'share an idea' process  <br>and what came out of it was very much <br>a kind of green, people-friendly city.<br>And when you - you know, I know they do surveys <br>at Wellington City that say two-thirds of adults  <br>in Wellington would cycle if they felt the <br>safe infrastructure was available to them,<br>especially now that there's e-bikes to <br>deal with the hills and the headwinds.<br>But, any time you go to remove car parks <br>or narrow lanes of traffic in order to put  <br>that safe cycling infrastructure in, <br>a minority of people usually object.<br>It's usually a small number, but they <br>tend to get the most attention from  <br>the local media and then the <br>politicians get very afraid,<br>and you know, and then you <br>don't see as much progress.<br>So, I'm hopeful that the tactical <br>urbanism approach will enable us to  <br>try more things and to bring the community along.<br>I also think we need better <br>representative consultation  <br>processes that make sure we're <br>hearing from the entire community  <br>and not just over representing the <br>views of a small number of people.<br>And I think ultimately, we need to have <br>some objective measures of success that  <br>we use to kind of measure the <br>outcomes of what we're doing<br>because I think if we don't have those, you know <br>- like, let's say it would be guidelines that say,  <br>"once you have a certain volume and speed of <br>traffic, you automatically have to put in a  <br>safe separated cycling if it's on an area route <br>that is a major connection for a cycle network."<br>Or, you know, and it doesn't even become - it has  <br>been technocratic decisions that have led <br>us to this very car-dependent landscape,<br>and you almost need to take it back to <br>changing those technocratic decisions  <br>in a way that supports the outcomes <br>that you know the community wants.<br>So, keep the high-level vision, the decision <br>that's defined by the public, and then,  <br>you know, use some really objective measures <br>to guide what infrastructure goes where.<br>Same with frequent public transport.<br>In order to achieve really <br>reliable frequent public  <br>transport, you do need to give buses priority,<br>and I think that just can't <br>be a local political decision.<br>It's got to be a little bit separated.<br>And just on that, I have a question here <br>from Nico that talks about - he says here,  <br>"in overseas and around the world, they <br>actively restrict development of greenfield  <br>spaces to within 800 metres of rapid transit <br>stations. Could we have an NPS - for those  <br>people who don't know what that means, <br>that's a National Policy Statement under  <br>the Resource Management Act - in New <br>Zealand to require something similar?"<br>What do you think about your views and as <br>Minister Associate Minister of Transport on that?<br>So, I was in Denmark and I was meeting <br>their head of their housing, kind of  <br>their - almost like their Ministry <br>for Housing and Urban Development,<br>and he was a civil servant, but I think the civil <br>service is a little bit more political there.<br>This was before they had the change of government,  <br>so this is when they had a centre-right, <br>or fairly right-wing actually, government.<br>And he was the one, he proudly told me they don't <br>allow any new housing development anywhere in the  <br>country unless it's within 800 meters of a <br>train station or a public transport stop.<br>And I thought that was really amazing. It just  <br>shows just how different the <br>political spectrum is there.<br>I think that in New Zealand that would <br>be considered quite a radical move and  <br>in the first instance I would <br>just like to get us into a more  <br>sensible approach on the spatial <br>planning and hopefully in the MPS<br>which, you know, the final version of <br>which should be announced pretty soon  <br>will go a long way to removing the barriers <br>to high-quality urban amenity and density,<br>and once you've removed those barriers,  <br>maybe in the future you can look <br>at how you provide more incentives.<br>I know that the Minister of Urban Development <br>and Transport has spoken about a desire to make  <br>sure that spatial planning is reflecting the <br>full impact and that will probably result in  <br>more greenfields areas that have, you <br>know, particular environmental value,<br>whether that's high-quality soils for <br>growing food or sensitive wetlands,  <br>they should be protected more.<br>I know that approach to spatial planning <br>so that the new greenfields development  <br>we do get is in a place where it <br>makes sense to have new development<br>and also that it has public transport <br>connections built in from the beginning.<br>Thank you and thank you very much for <br>taking these questions. This is fantastic,  <br>and thanks to everyone who's sending them through.<br>I've got another one here from Rebecca:  <br>"Your graph showed a big increase in <br>emissions from transport around 2013."<br>"Is this because of SUVs and what <br>is happening to flatten the curve?"<br>"And would an EV subsidy - is <br>the EV subsidy going ahead?"<br>Well, the EV subsidy, which wasn't <br>a direct subsidy, by the way.<br>We called it the 'clean car discount'.<br>It is a fee bait which says, you know, <br>"the more polluting vehicles pay a little  <br>bit extra and that directly finances <br>your discounts on your lower-emitting  <br>vehicles.The biggest discounts go to <br>pure EVs or zero-emission vehicles,"<br>but even hybrids would get a bit of a <br>discount under the proposal we put forward.<br>We haven't been able to get support from one <br>of the coalition parties for that policy,  <br>and so I'm, you know, quite frustrated that we <br>have been able to make progress on the issue.<br>But, I'm very confident that if the parties <br>that are returned to government are,  <br>you know, supportive then it will <br>- it can happen quite quickly.<br>And not just the fee bait, but <br>also a fuel efficiency standard,  <br>and those two policies really work together <br>to reduce the emissions from the light fleet.<br>I do think that around 2013, we suddenly started <br>- we had a bump and started to have growth in new  <br>vehicle imports because that really slowed <br>down after the GFC in end of 2008-2009.<br>We saw a big decline in the number <br>of vehicles that were being imported,<br>and then from 2013 it really <br>started to take off again.<br>And in the top 10 most popular <br>vehicles that are being imported  <br>are a number of double cab utes and SUVs <br>which are, you know, less fuel-efficient.<br>So, we absolutely need some incentives in place  <br>and some standards if we're <br>going to reduce emissions.<br>And yeah, all I can say is a party vote <br>Green, and we can make that happen.<br>I think that there's also more, as I said before,  <br>to be done on freight mode shift and incentives <br>for heavy vehicles as well to be more efficient.<br>I've got a question here from Mustafa, <br>and I think this is a quite a good one  <br>and it comes back to the urban <br>growth agenda which, you know,  <br>I think obviously given the slight changes we've <br>discussed and where we've been with Covid, but...<br>They're asking the question, "what do you think <br>is the better option for public transport:  <br>electric buses or electric trains in Auckland?"<br>I think both. You know, electric <br>trains have been really successful.<br>I'm really proud of that achievement because <br>the Green Party did have a big campaign.<br>That's when I joined the Greens <br>in 2006 to get electrification  <br>of Auckland's rail network - or 2007 - <br>and that finally got delivered in 2008,  <br>but we didn't actually see the electric <br>trains on there, you know, till 2015.<br>So, these things take time.<br>Buses will continue to be really important <br>to Auckland's public transport network and  <br>if they're really run well then they're <br>not competing with the rail line,<br>but they're serving the rail line and they're <br>providing those feeder services or they're  <br>providing services where there is no rail line and <br>there's still plenty of places in Auckland that,  <br>you know, don't have a rail line and probably <br>won't for at least another five to ten years.<br>So, we really do need to transition to electric  <br>buses and there won't just <br>be benefits for the climate.<br>They are quieter.<br>They can be cheaper to run and there's less <br>particulates, harmful diesel particulates,  <br>which are - actually can be quite <br>problematic for people's health,  <br>especially in places like Queen <br>Street which is a bit of a valley.<br>So, just picking up - I'm just going to ask <br>a question of my own - picking up the point  <br>you made which is very well made about <br>transport and doing the lifting there,<br>some colleagues at Massey University talked about <br>the life experience - building materials and  <br>the things associated with this, energy <br>consumption of housing, size of housing,<br>and if we continue on the project <br>we're on now we're probably going  <br>to exceed our -and you talked about our Paris <br>obligations by - and they were suggesting 5%.<br>What's your feeling in terms <br>of growth, urban growth,  <br>in terms of size of housing and building <br>materials and things like along those lines?<br>Well, the government, this government <br>is taking a much more active role  <br>in the provision of housing and I <br>think that is a real opportunity.<br>With Kainga Ora, you know, thousands of <br>new state homes are being provided and  <br>I know that they have a commitment <br>to Green Star level six minimum,<br>that they're looking at a <br>much more integrated typology.<br>So, rather than just staying alone houses <br>in a really car-dependent neighbourhood,  <br>they are trying to build in those, <br>you know, complete community approach,<br>which would include, you know, <br>cycleways and public transport  <br>and hopefully other services and amenities in <br>the neighbourhood so it's not just all houses.<br>Also, the urban development, there's <br>a bill that's kind of currently in  <br>progress which is about setting <br>up an Urban Development Authority.<br>which means that government can take even more of <br>a proactive approach into how development occurs.<br>And I think that's really our biggest <br>opportunity, especially now in the  <br>post-Covid environment where we might see a bit <br>of a reduction in immigration in the short term.<br>In the medium to long term we might see a real <br>increase in the demand to live in New Zealand.<br>And it's really important <br>where development happens,  <br>I'd say kind of in the most best-practice way.<br>Governments, city or central governments, are <br>usually very involved in the development process.<br>The community can be really involved <br>in developing the structure plan,<br>and the private sector is really <br>there just to deliver the buildings.\<br>And those need to be to a high standard so, you <br>know, low waste, low water use, energy-efficient.<br>It's healthier. It's better for the tenants or  <br>the owners of the property because <br>they spent less heating their home.<br>So, there's huge opportunities there and <br>I think that our government absolutely  <br>needs to be leading in this area <br>with our state house developments  <br>and with future projects of the <br>Urban Development Authority.<br>I've got one last question that unfortunately <br>doesn't have a name attached to it,<br>but it's something I have to say in my <br>role on the UDF (the Urban Design Forum),  <br>we've made submissions on this as well,<br>and it's the idea of maybe - in New South Wales <br>you have the office of the Government Architect or  <br>something of that thing about being an independent <br>body looking at promoting good quality design,<br>a bit like what you had with CABE in the UK and <br>as I say, New South Wales, you have the state  <br>office of the state architect, whether that's an <br>urban design, architectural build or whatever.<br>What's your feelings on that sort <br>of independent body to improve the  <br>quality of design throughout our <br>cities, especially in Auckland?<br>I think it has a lot of merit.<br>I can't say if there's any particular <br>development happening to make that happen,<br>but I certainly think it <br>has a lot of merit and it's  <br>something the government should have its eye on.<br>I think I've got one last <br>question here. It's from George.<br>"In the UK, transport for London's Mini-Holland <br>project... programme has delivered significant  <br>increases in walking and cycling levels <br>throughout, the changing existing streets  <br>based on best practice. Is there potential <br>to try something similar in New Zealand?"<br>Well, yeah. Again, I think <br>that the tactical urbanism  <br>is probably our first step into that approach.<br>I do think that, you know, as this decade goes <br>by we're going to have to be thinking in a much  <br>more ambitious way about what is possible and <br>what is necessary to address climate change,<br>but also to have healthier, happier, <br>more people-friendly towns and cities,<br>and I'm really, really hopeful that we can catch <br>up with other parts of the world in this area.<br>Okay, we're just coming up to - oh, I <br>think we've got room for one last one.<br>It's from Rebecca, and then I think we'lI <br>call it cause we're running out of time.<br>And I'll just say it's lovely <br>to see your son there. It's  <br>great to have him there in <br>the background. It's great.<br>What's Rebecca say? Sorry, not Rebecca. Rachel.<br>"I completely agree with your comments about not <br>being able to build your way out of congestion.<br>Should we be looking at removing consideration of  <br>congestion levels or service impacts <br>for developments through the NPS?<br>Currently, it's a hand brake on intensification."<br>That's really interesting.<br>I'm interested to know exactly how that works <br>as a hand brake at the moment, whether that's  <br>just through the practice of the council or <br>whether it's something that's explicitly set out.<br>I don't believe it's explicitly set out <br>in District Plans, but maybe I'm wrong.<br>I think it's more something that's <br>done through the practice of traffic  <br>engineering and their assessment of <br>environmental impacts and that makes  <br>it a little bit harder to change through <br>a National Policy Statement because  <br>that's usually just guiding the policies or <br>objectives and rules in the District Plan,<br>whereas I think what - it is an effect <br>- all right, so Rachel's added "it's  <br>an effect under the RMA. Any discretionary <br>activity gets pinged for traffic effects."<br>It is - again, I don't think <br>it's explicitly mentioned in  <br>the RMA that levels of service for <br>vehicles or congestion is an amenity,<br>but I think that it ends up through <br>the practice of what the consultant  <br>engineers and the council engineers <br>are saying, it does get considered<br>and so, that is something I think really needs <br>to be driven through the professional practice of  <br>traffic engineers and very, very happy to raise it <br>with the - particularly, you know, NZTA and it's -<br>I think it's something that <br>potentially NZTA could address  <br>through some of its guidance for engineers, <br>both consultants and at the council level.<br>But, I think Auckland Transport <br>would be a good place to start  <br>and I can raise that with the people <br>I speak to at Auckland Transport and  <br>see what - where does the change need to <br>happen so that this stops being a barrier.<br>Yeah, I think it's a practice distance <br>between the traffic engineers.<br>Just while we're talking about the <br>RMA, and I don't want to dwell on it,<br>but what do you think about the work - <br>the work that Justice Randerson's been  <br>doing in the direction with the potential <br>changes to the Resource Management Act?<br>What's your feelings on those?<br>When we met with the panel I was pretty encouraged  <br>with what they said they were looking at, <br>so I'm eager to see what the outcome is.<br>I don't think we've seen the specific <br>recommendations yet for all of the changes.<br>Some of it is happening, <br>but the longer-term changes.<br>Alright, I think we're just rolling around <br>to 7:30 and we've taken an hour of your time.<br>And I'd just really like to thank you <br>again for making the time available,  <br>and it's lovely to see you again <br>to come along tonight and be the  <br>first - second speaker in the restart <br>of our programme for the Fast Forward.<br>That's a really important thing for us, <br>as you know as a graduate of the school.<br>It's really important for our school <br>to be outreaching with the community,  <br>with our built form discipline.<br>So, thanks very much. Have a lovely <br>night and I'm sure we'll see you again.<br>And just before everyone goes, <br>I'd just like to - speaking of  <br>the Minister of Urban Development - he, <br>the Honorable Phil Twyford is coming up  <br>next and he's going to be talking about the <br>UDAs and the Urban Development Authority,<br>so we're looking forward to that which <br>is coming forward later on in July.<br>So, have a good night everyone.<br>Thank you again, Julie Anne. It's been a <br>pleasure to have you all here with us tonight,<br>and thank you on behalf of the University <br>for your time and good night. Thank you.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
