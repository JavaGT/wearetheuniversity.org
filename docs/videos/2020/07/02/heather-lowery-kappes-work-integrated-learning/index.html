here today with<br>Hilary Kappas she is one of the career<br>advisors at the University of Waikato<br>I'm here now if you could just tell us a<br>little bit about yourself in a role sure<br>so as I said my name's here but I went<br>for the University of Waikato is a<br>career development advisor so my role is<br>to help all the students find that dream<br>job in their pathway towards it and then<br>help them to navigate the different<br>tools and things that they need to use<br>in order to get that job cool<br>so what else does the career development<br>services offer like you mentioned the<br>the dream job of these soon to be<br>graduates but they must be more to what<br>you you're on your team though yeah it's<br>a pretty broad scope so we do although<br>the career pathway the Career Planning<br>the career counselling side of things<br>and you can have one-on-one appointments<br>with a careers adviser or you can come<br>to a drop-in for 15 minutes and she said<br>quit chatting about what you're thinking<br>maybe hate your papers maybe you are<br>thinking hey what I was thinking before<br>isn't going to work for me now all those<br>kind of conversations ahead with us and<br>then it moves on and for some of the<br>more practical tools that you need to<br>help you so it's about the planning like<br>you know what kind of volunteering you<br>might be doing what kind of things that<br>you might get involved in what<br>internship program would be better for<br>you all that kind of stuff as well as<br>maybe thinking about which part when<br>jobs are going to offer you the most<br>skills and the most benefit to moving<br>forward and then it goes onto all the<br>tools you need so CV development cover<br>letters applications scholarship<br>applications LinkedIn profiles prepping<br>for your interviews and then just kind<br>of thinking about your whole self as a<br>brand and how you're going to put<br>yourself out into market we also go over<br>and networking because of course that's<br>just a paramount skill you need to<br>about your career and also that kind of<br>future planning so for a lot of people<br>they have a long-term plan and then a<br>short-term plan so we'll kind of often<br>working on the short-term but we're also<br>looking at the long view for you and<br>helping you to kind of figure out what's<br>the beef so it's quite involved yes our<br>department is kind of broken into a<br>couple of spaces we have a couple of<br>advisors like doing the job that I do<br>and do a lot of that counseling and in<br>the tool stuff and but we also have the<br>employability Plus program so that's a<br>volunteering program and it's about<br>getting you involved in the community<br>volunteering but also volunteering on<br>campus called university participation<br>and also doing workshops and other<br>things to develop you along the way so<br>it's kind of all broad we're also in the<br>department but does the employer visits<br>and they expose and we do virtual stuff<br>all the time as well it's so holistic I<br>just love you you can imagine like a<br>first year coming in and literally your<br>hand hold them right through it like in<br>how they study obviously we've had a big<br>shift in workplaces recently with the<br>covert pandemic have you had any<br>indications of what the job market might<br>be like for a recent or new graduates I<br>think that one of the things that<br>possibly has been happening as we're<br>hearing a lot of doom and gloom in the<br>media and so it's making it a lot of the<br>students and other people panicked and a<br>little bit concerned but what we're<br>seeing is that the jobs are still coming<br>through and graduates are still getting<br>jobs in the getting jobs in the middle<br>of covered in a starting in the middle<br>of covert but what I think it has done<br>which I'm really happy about this many<br>people are weird that they actually need<br>to be working on their career but just<br>doing your degree isn't enough to make<br>you employable and so in a way I quite<br>like what's happened because it's made<br>people just<br>open the eyes to the fact there you<br>can't just put your head down on the<br>sand and finish your degree and think<br>okay then somebody will pass me a job<br>getting the job you want and getting the<br>kind of career that you would like takes<br>planning and takes a little bit of<br>effort from you yeah definitely I think<br>you'll probably find people would more<br>likely reach out to you at this time as<br>well we have been pretty busy online all<br>the way through and we still are yeah so<br>what I'm saying is I've only seen one<br>cancellation for a graduate opportunity<br>what was an internship and they were<br>that winter and clerkships<br>for law and obviously that was because<br>they were for kind of now and things<br>were a little bit volatile too you know<br>for them to do all the Graduate roles<br>have still rolled through I'm still<br>seeing jobs comin I've still had jobs<br>come in and posted them online for<br>part-time jobs during the pandemic so<br>yeah we're not seeing a downturn in jobs<br>I think obviously there are certain<br>industries that are really affected but<br>the university isn't he Lee into<br>hospitality or aviation so you know a<br>lot of our graduates aren't going to be<br>affected they may be affected of those<br>were the kind of spaces they wanted to<br>go to and it's about just okay now I<br>need to claim to maybe pathway a<br>different way and then come back to it<br>later on in my career yeah that's<br>awesome<br>and is there anything that students or<br>graduates need to do to get noticed for<br>shortlisting for interviews particularly<br>now but obviously long term for their<br>careers yeah we we're selling the same<br>message we've been selling all along you<br>got to get out there and network guys<br>you can't just stay in your own little<br>circle or your own bubble other people<br>need to know you outside the bubble that<br>urine so one of the things that you need<br>to do is get involved in your<br>associations on campus you know any PPE<br>and do some volunteering and get better<br>out there into the public do your<br>internships think about part-time work<br>and<br>work experience or job shadowing and<br>things like there and go online into all<br>the free webinars that are on at the<br>moment and engage with virtual things<br>online where you get to talk to<br>employers and things like that all those<br>things get you noticed and they help to<br>disrupt that channel of just applying<br>online we nobody knows you because if<br>you're a graduate that I've met even<br>once you have a much more likely of<br>being able to get to an interview then<br>somebody I've never met<br>New Zealanders are relational we like to<br>meet the people we employ yeah<br>definitely I think and my experience<br>networking and relationships have you<br>know it got to me far so I absolutely<br>hear what you're saying and I know of a<br>lot of students that have done it really<br>well so it always the most successful<br>students are the ones that just get out<br>there and a little bit outside their<br>comfort zone but you know it doesn't<br>take long to get to know quite a few<br>people in for them to know you and I<br>mean you know you're on your way yeah<br>that's awesome do you think that post<br>coded the the actual workplace will look<br>quite different I don't I think that one<br>of the things they're one of those you<br>know soft skills I think have become the<br>and I hate the word soft skills I'm<br>gonna say essential skills okay so those<br>people skills the idea of keeping a set<br>being resilient being able to adapt<br>good communication being motivated<br>almost have become much more important<br>because when you're working from home or<br>remotely those kind of things are the<br>things you rely on you know the internal<br>and I think they're going to be much<br>more important to employers moving<br>forward I also think you just have to be<br>there you have to get comfortable with<br>things like zoom and with you know<br>meetups and things like that online and<br>you know I'm gonna say to students turn<br>on your cameras right cuz if I can see<br>your face we're not been amazing I'm Way<br>more going to engage with you but also<br>I'm going to remember your face when you<br>apply for that job yeah yeah definitely<br>I have seen a lot of cameras<br>and off recently and yet it's hard<br>because you don't rely on those little<br>cues that you get from facial<br>expressions or body language yes<br>especially if you're in a networking or<br>you're an employer engagement kind of<br>space where maybe they're doing a<br>virtual thing turn on your camera you'll<br>be one of the team with you camera<br>turned on and they'll remember your face<br>when you go to apply for their jobs<br>sure is there anything that you think<br>graduates need to do to secure a job at<br>the moment I I think it is about having<br>and being able to demonstrate those soft<br>skills as well as your technical skills<br>from your from your studies so I think<br>it is about having experiences and<br>thinking about how you can demonstrate<br>those and the different spaces that you<br>need to on your CV when you're writing<br>your cover letter I think it's also<br>about having a really good dual brand so<br>for those students who haven't yet got<br>onto LinkedIn now's the time to start to<br>develop your profile and make it a<br>strong profile and you know get some<br>pictures in there in memory to social<br>media so you also want to kind of engage<br>with some of the stuff online put up<br>pictures make comments get involved in<br>some of the groups as well so it's not<br>enough just to have the profile you<br>actually have to get a little bit but<br>once you've got a profile 15 minutes a<br>week can keep you engaged in LinkedIn<br>and make it easy for people to find you<br>yeah that's awesome if we got a long way<br>since esthetics CV hasn't it<br>definitely definitely and this is your<br>online online kind of digital brand<br>forever and because of the LinkedIn Al<br>Gore algorithms it's always going to be<br>the first thing that turns up when I<br>google search you and I'm gonna google<br>search you if I'm an employer so you<br>might as well make sure that there's a<br>brand new that you created for them so<br>that they can see how fabulous you are<br>probably safer than an Instagram profile<br>coming up isn't it yes and clean up your<br>Instagram so I guess just lastly kind of<br>what pointers would you give a graduate<br>student who has been unsuccessful you<br>know and they're trying to get a job or<br>an internship my first the first thing I<br>always ask a student is at what point<br>are they being unsuccessful so if<br>they're putting on their applications<br>and they're not getting any further than<br>there you mean need to maybe engage with<br>us and we need to look and review your<br>cover letter and your CV if you're<br>getting to the next round and you're<br>falling over at the phone interview then<br>we need to look at your phone interview<br>skills and practice fear if you're<br>falling over it the psychometric test<br>then that's the but you know so it's at<br>what stage are you falling over and<br>let's you know make an appointment with<br>somebody on my career I can see it<br>behind me through support on your WIC<br>home page when you log into the<br>university and talk to an advisor and<br>I'm sure that we'll be able to help you<br>we've often helped people who've you<br>know been unsuccessful maybe even 40<br>applications and then they we've<br>reworked things and then they've got<br>through to the end and got the offer<br>also know that in this climate we've got<br>so many people applying some so many<br>people from not just the university but<br>people have lost jobs and other<br>industries that you will all probably<br>not get the first job that you apply for<br>but be resilient<br>it's not about affect that there's<br>something wrong with you it's just the<br>fact that you are going to be competing<br>in a market with is just more people in<br>the market so very resilient keep going<br>put in good applications and you will be<br>successful as always that's awesome<br>and I know that your service extends<br>beyond just your time at university as<br>well you work with alumni yes we work<br>with an alumni up to two years so in<br>terms of you know if you're thinking oh<br>I finished and I can't use the service<br>yes you can and also you know for those<br>first couple of years out and out after<br>you walk across the stage and get care<br>you are able to use the service it's<br>just a slightly different<br>you'll probably have to do it apply for<br>it and be accepted just to say you're an<br>alumni and then you go through and you<br>can use all the same services fantastic<br>I'm sure there's a lot of people they'll<br>be coming towards you now after hearing<br>that and I'm sure you boys got time as<br>well I know that you do a really<br>passionate about our graduates<br>you know seeing them succeed post<br>University yes yeah I think that that's<br>one of the things that's great about our<br>team as we're all passionate about that<br>we're all passionate about the<br>university work at all most of us are<br>alumni as well but also we know that you<br>know it's not easy it's never been easy<br>to take that first step out and<br>transition into a new role but you know<br>we've learned all the
