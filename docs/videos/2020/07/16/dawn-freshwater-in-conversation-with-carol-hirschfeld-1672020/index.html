professor dawn freshwater<br>became the university of auckland's<br>sixth vice chancellor and first ever<br>woman to take up the position<br>genyo the university magazine headlined<br>a feature profile on her appointment<br>as dawn of a new era suitably hopeful<br>and welcoming so what can the university<br>community<br>and the world beyond the campus expect<br>in the months and years to come<br>i'm very pleased to welcome vice<br>chancellor dawn freshwater<br>to this live webinar tonight and have<br>this as an opportunity<br>to talk to her about her vision of the<br>university and also a chance for us all<br>to learn<br>more about the experiences that have led<br>her to this place<br>and this role a very warm welcome<br>to atawai maori kia ora carol<br>dawn that i have a wonderful phenomena<br>who pointed out what a fabulously<br>optimistic name you have which prompted<br>that translation<br>thank you now during our session we're<br>going to be inviting<br>members of our audience to offer up<br>questions<br>but i want to begin with my own so<br>back in march on march 16th you were due<br>to take up your<br>new position here at the university but<br>within days the year uh the prime<br>minister<br>was already announcing the national<br>alert system<br>and hinting that there was going to be a<br>complete lockdown<br>in terms of an introduction to a new job<br>and a new country<br>that sounds positively surreal was it<br>it absolutely was carol yes and i have<br>to say i think<br>fortunately i had visited the university<br>and knew the university was a little<br>familiar<br>with new zealand before i came but<br>on the day that i arrived i arrived the<br>night before i was due to commence my<br>new role<br>and i knew that we were in this sort of<br>difficult transition through kovid<br>because i'd left a similar situation<br>when i'd left australia but very very<br>keen and delighted to have arrived<br>in auckland prior to any decisions being<br>made<br>around lockdown or quarantine and<br>enthusiastically<br>appearing at the campus on the monday<br>morning ready to meet with my new team<br>and to commence the work and of course<br>immediately that happened i became aware<br>that one of the first things that we had<br>to do was make a decision<br>about how we were going to prepare for<br>what was<br>by then becoming inevitable which was<br>a move off campus and so that was the<br>very first experience i had which was a<br>bit surreal<br>new country new job new team<br>and of course not very much opportunity<br>to get to know the environment or the<br>campus at all<br>how responsive do you think the<br>university was<br>to the threat of the pandemic i mean<br>what did you walk into were you pleased<br>with what you saw in terms of the<br>planning<br>so i was very fortunate that the<br>university had already put together<br>some thinking around the pandemic the<br>strategic response team were already<br>meeting<br>and had already begun to do some of this<br>work and that had begun quite early so<br>january february<br>thinking particularly about students who<br>were offshore and how to manage<br>that particular issue but more broadly<br>going forward how we would manage if<br>kovid became<br>embedded within the community so that<br>team were already meeting<br>and i have to say for institutions that<br>are<br>so large and often referred to as slow<br>to move<br>monolithic is sometimes the way they<br>describe the university was<br>really becoming exceptionally responsive<br>agile in the way in which it was<br>reacting to<br>and as much as possible preparing<br>to give the students the best possible<br>experience and to ensure that our staff<br>were able to function off-site some of<br>that was already in place<br>and then we were able to move really<br>rapidly when we needed to<br>we'll talk more about that response and<br>the<br>preparedness shortly dawn but i want to<br>go back to<br>your list of priorities that were<br>actually top of mind as you were coming<br>into this job<br>before covert 19 overrode everything<br>what were your considerations<br>so three things the first thing i knew<br>that the university was due<br>to develop and iterate a new strategy<br>very exciting really great opportunities<br>in that regard<br>particularly given the situation we're<br>in geopolitically and where we're<br>situated<br>oteroa and the pacific communities and<br>what could be done in the oceanic region<br>and so<br>very excited to work with the university<br>community on a new strategy<br>and clarify our purpose in a<br>changing environment globally where<br>higher education has<br>really been under pressure to transform<br>itself<br>and secondly in doing that to really set<br>the tone<br>and the culture of the university going<br>forward to make it distinctive<br>and of course thirdly to think of the<br>university as a sustainable institution<br>way beyond my time<br>as vice chancellor and when i talk about<br>sustainability<br>i mean in the broadest sense so not just<br>thinking about<br>immediate financial concerns or indeed<br>campus or maintenance or any of those<br>issues thinking about<br>its longevity into the future and<br>the legacy that we would leave so<br>already thinking about my legacy<br>coming in as you thought about that<br>legacy<br>had you had time to actually scope the<br>university at all<br>before you i imagine you would have how<br>how often had you visited and what did<br>you know of the university<br>so i knew the university a little from<br>previous experience of working through<br>world university networks and<br>international networks and so i'd had<br>some engagement with the university in<br>that regard and<br>it's not really a secret now people do<br>know but a few years before that i was<br>invited to the university<br>of auckland to give a lecture and to<br>meet some of the students in the staff<br>in the school of nursing<br>because there's a very strong nursing<br>school here and that was my previous<br>discipline and so i'd visited<br>many years ago but i'd never really<br>spent any time or dwelt<br>on the campus so what i knew was from<br>a pretty much an external perspective<br>and of course we do benchmarking of<br>universities globally and auckland was<br>one of the universities that i've<br>benchmarked against in the past<br>so i had some insights and some<br>information but there's nothing like the<br>feel of the place carol<br>and nothing like really getting yourself<br>immersed i like to talk about<br>rolling my sleeves up and getting my<br>hands dirty because that's the way<br>that you really get to know an<br>environment and the people within it<br>your own history stretches nottingham<br>university<br>the university of leeds and the<br>university of western australia<br>where you were immediately before<br>arriving here was there a connection was<br>there a continuum through to auckland<br>university<br>that in some ways brought you here<br>there was and isn't it interesting on<br>reflection it's not always<br>easy to see those connections at the<br>time as they unfold<br>and on reflection they're much more<br>explicit<br>so university of nottingham university<br>of leeds both russell group universities<br>world-class institutions research<br>intensive institutions<br>very much committed to translating<br>research into<br>improving lives for people in the<br>community<br>and global universities and<br>leeds of course very much connected<br>through the world university networks to<br>the university of western australia<br>another research intensive university a<br>member of the group of eight<br>and another university that was really<br>committed<br>not only to improving lives through its<br>research but addressing issues<br>that were related to the indigenous<br>population<br>and to ensuring that we were really<br>reflective<br>of our communities in all shapes and<br>sizes<br>and that was a really tough job to do<br>because we were nowhere near that<br>and then of course coming to the<br>university of auckland a research<br>intensive university<br>really embedded as a civic institution<br>an anchor institution in the city<br>and part of the same networks that i've<br>come from<br>and really committed to delivering high<br>quality education<br>and research that informs and is<br>relevant<br>and impactful to its communities here<br>and in the regions<br>so there is a strong connection actually<br>throughout you were at the university of<br>western australia<br>for several years before you came here<br>two and a half<br>of those years as vice chancellor what<br>was<br>it about your experience there which you<br>feel<br>has shaped your thinking about going<br>into a<br>multiculturally diverse place<br>such as auckland and and that's one of<br>the wonderful things about being in<br>auckland it is such a multicultural and<br>diverse<br>environment and with a wonderful<br>tradition and heritage and<br>so many opportunities to really build on<br>that and that was one of the things i<br>learned about being in western australia<br>and in fact i should say being in a city<br>like<br>nottingham and leads very multicultural<br>cities<br>diverse environments diverse student<br>bodies<br>so you know that is another part of<br>what's very attractive about being in<br>auckland<br>um i think i learned and this goes to<br>your question about you know what shaped<br>it's really important i think through<br>those lessons learned in those<br>environments before i got here to<br>understand take time to understand<br>where i'm situated how i've landed where<br>i am the context the environment<br>and to listen and to actively listen<br>and to think about that in a way that<br>helps us to consider<br>how to do something distinctive and<br>unique<br>with our strategy and in doing so<br>lifting all boats and doing something<br>that's really in the service of the<br>nation<br>and what i've found through my<br>experience is each of those institutions<br>albeit diverse and albeit multicultural<br>inclusive in different ways<br>has something unique to offer and is<br>distinctive in and of its own right<br>and that's really the essence of what<br>we're going to<br>put right at the heart of our new<br>strategy<br>dawn i'm going to take this minute to<br>remind our audience that we<br>are indeed taking questions and we'd<br>love to hear what you're thinking about<br>the conversation and some of the things<br>that that<br>dawn is talking to you can use the q and<br>a<br>function on zoom to submit your<br>questions and of course upvote questions<br>by using the thumbs up<br>icon so dawn i suppose<br>you know it's it's it's wonderful to<br>hear uh<br>your fulsome um excitement<br>about uh the diversity that you<br>are enjoyed have enjoyed at the<br>different places that<br>you have already served at and certainly<br>in auckland it is a<br>central function of the university did<br>you<br>did you feel equipped as in<br>in every way to take on that challenge<br>of coming into a place that<br>is so multicultural and diverse<br>absolutely<br>not and i say that<br>in this context we are all<br>experts as we grow through our life in<br>some things<br>and i may be i've developed expertise in<br>many areas<br>but we are simultaneously novices in<br>many other areas of our lives<br>and hopefully as we grow through novice<br>to advanced<br>beginner and proficient we're learning<br>and we learn some expertise along the<br>way<br>the reality is as an expert in some<br>areas i have some transferable skills<br>and that means that as i learn<br>but as a novice in otero<br>and in auckland and learning about the<br>maori culture and<br>what it means to be situated here i have<br>some transferable skills<br>from the expertise i've developed in<br>other situations so<br>you know hopefully i sort of am able to<br>bring those transferable skills<br>and use them in the service of that<br>learning<br>scaling up my learning as quickly as<br>possible but of course<br>every context is different and if i'd<br>assumed<br>that i had all the skills already and<br>had the knowledge that i needed then<br>i would really be doing both myself the<br>university<br>and the community as a disservice missed<br>opportunities to<br>learn and a missed opportunity to be<br>engaged in really expanding myself<br>one area of real expertise that you do<br>have is around<br>reducing inequity in education<br>and opportunity around education<br>what do you see as the real area for<br>development here in auckland<br>well it's clear that we have a lot to do<br>both in terms of<br>if i think about the university first<br>in terms of both our students and our<br>staff<br>cohorts and and i think this is one of<br>the things that we're looking at now in<br>the new strategy<br>we really need to think about our<br>university communities and our staff<br>particularly as representing and<br>representative of our broader<br>communities<br>it's we get it such a diversity of<br>thought<br>diversity of solutions and a diversity<br>of<br>thinking in terms of you know creativity<br>if we do that so<br>there's a significant piece of work that<br>needs to happen in that regard but i<br>particularly want to go to the school's<br>engagement strategy<br>i think my experience is a lot of what<br>we need to do is start very young<br>with schools when we're thinking about<br>diversity and equity we need to start<br>making sure that<br>we approach the environments that we're<br>talking about school environments and<br>perhaps even early learning with<br>you know the sort of approaches in mind<br>that are helping people to think about<br>long-term their planning having some<br>opportunities ahead<br>ahead of them but but not um<br>particularly thinking about what it is<br>that we would want<br>in that regard helping people to realize<br>their imaginations and their<br>inspirations and their ambitions<br>to do that we have to understand what<br>they are and actually<br>they have to understand what they are<br>quite early as well so from us i think<br>we've got<br>quite a bit of work to do in our<br>school's engagement as well<br>and i think the other part of what we<br>ought to be doing at the university<br>we've got<br>great relationships with the city<br>already<br>and great relationships with ewe and<br>hapu<br>we need to continue to build on those<br>when you consider the university's<br>performance over the past four months<br>and<br>and just returning now to to the<br>response to the pandemic what do you<br>think the biggest lesson has been so far<br>so there are many lessons in all of this<br>and um and<br>it's actually i feel really thrilled<br>when i look back and see what's happened<br>over the last three or four months<br>and and have we we've responded in<br>particular so i really want to call out<br>the way in which we were able to move to<br>online delivery very quickly and<br>maintain the quality<br>and the engagement of our students<br>and actually to manage some of the<br>pastoral care<br>in a very different way so it says<br>that's something that's that really i<br>think we need to celebrate<br>the other thing that i think's really<br>important an important lesson here and i<br>mentioned this when i was meeting with<br>ministers and the prime minister<br>recently<br>what's happened through covid is there's<br>been a rehabilitation<br>of evidence and a development of trust<br>again<br>in evidence and a trust in the expert<br>that was really diminishing<br>over time and i think what i've seen<br>particularly<br>through the development of the evidence<br>base that's been used<br>to support covid's outcomes and to<br>support the way in which we've managed<br>it<br>is that people have been relying on the<br>research<br>on the evidence and using that to inform<br>decisions<br>in terms of online learning uh you<br>mentioned this earlier that one of the<br>one of your first acts was to actually<br>basically<br>get everybody in the mode of thinking of<br>remote learning and the university<br>basically closed fairly early in terms<br>of<br>closing classes and just getting people<br>at home<br>so why did you take that action well<br>immediately on arrival it seemed to me<br>that we were going to have only a very<br>short amount of time before we were<br>going to<br>need to move off campus and go into<br>lockdown<br>and it seemed to me that that one of the<br>ways in which we needed to<br>buy ourselves some time so that we could<br>prepare for a longer term delivery<br>of high quality online programs and<br>the experience that we wanted to wrap<br>around that<br>was to say that we would take a week<br>where we would have a teaching free week<br>and that was the opportunity for staff<br>to really<br>get the mindset of we're going to be<br>moving to online<br>how can we translate what we already do<br>in a way that it that<br>you know suits this particular modality<br>and<br>um and to do that quite rapidly and so<br>it was a case of saying everything else<br>is off the table for the next week<br>as it happens we had three days because<br>by wednesday we were going into<br>uh lockdown so but it was actually<br>really helpful to to be able to say<br>let's give ourselves some time to do<br>this<br>so that we have a little bit of a<br>lead-in and a run-in to<br>managing this process was there any<br>resistance i mean<br>you know we we were laughing about the<br>idea that that<br>earlier that you know universities are<br>described as monoliths<br>slow to move but that wasn't the case<br>here<br>it absolutely wasn't now of course some<br>courses are already offered online and<br>mixed modalities are used so there's<br>blended learning that takes place so<br>this isn't<br>completely new to the university and<br>many staff record their lectures<br>and are engaged in different ways of of<br>supporting students so it's a<br>sort of a big shift to fully online but<br>not without an understanding of the<br>benefits that that brings and not<br>without some expertise and experience<br>and there's a great support team helping<br>the academic staff to do this<br>as well so i didn't actually experience<br>the resistance to that i think<br>what's really important in all of this<br>is the communication<br>and if if the biggest thing i've learned<br>through this particular crisis<br>and again it just reaffirms things that<br>have happened in the past where i've had<br>to respond quickly<br>is even if we don't have any certainty<br>we really need to communicate that we're<br>not certain<br>and that this is what we're going to do<br>we're hoping to have it this way<br>but that we're really only sharing what<br>we know now<br>and we'll share as much as we know now<br>but we don't know any more than that and<br>it's so important to keep communicating<br>with staff and explaining the rationale<br>behind the decisions<br>and i think from that point of view even<br>if it's difficult<br>and it has been difficult even if it's<br>difficult<br>with a rational explanation we can all<br>turn our minds to making it happen<br>have you had a chance to even meet all<br>of your<br>management team in person over the short<br>period that you've actually been here<br>given the conditions so i'm now i'm very<br>familiar with the senior leadership<br>team on zoo so i got very familiar with<br>the monsoon<br>much more familiar than perhaps i would<br>have done if we weren't on zoom because<br>zoom of course<br>brings people into your home brought<br>people into my home<br>so that was a really great way of<br>getting to know<br>people without really the frills<br>stripped back i say we were stripped<br>there<br>now i have had an opportunity to meet<br>many of them and many of the other<br>senior leaders across the<br>university in fact today i was in one of<br>the faculties<br>and i'm doing lots of small mini tours<br>now<br>to get around the campus and to get to<br>know people face to face<br>what was i think um very helpful at<br>least for me<br>and i think for some of the staff is<br>that we've moved very quickly to<br>all staff meetings on a regular basis<br>using zoom<br>and this at least gave an opportunity<br>for people to have a sense of belonging<br>during this time when we were also<br>dispersed and unable to really<br>communicate with each other face to face<br>or even meet<br>um in small groups so i think you know<br>that actually really led to<br>a sense of community quite early on<br>we're only something like 10 days out<br>really from semester<br>to dawn and i wonder with everything<br>that has happened<br>and now the familiarity with online<br>teaching<br>is the pivot to online going to be<br>something that's very much<br>permanent in terms of the course and<br>courses offered and the op the way that<br>the university operates into the future<br>so if we just put covid 19 to one side<br>for a moment carol<br>universities have already been<br>responding to<br>the what's happening in mega trends in<br>society so the development of technology<br>ai automation the digitalization<br>student expectations are changing<br>continuously<br>and of course employers are looking for<br>something<br>really particular in terms of the<br>graduate and graduate<br>outcomes not not least students looking<br>for employability<br>and we need to respond to employment<br>needs we also need to make sure that<br>we're able to<br>support our students to have what will<br>be many careers in the future<br>and many opportunities in a very<br>different environment with the future of<br>work<br>that was already happening and so we'd<br>already started to make some moves<br>towards<br>providing alternative ways of studying<br>and looking at how we make available our<br>content<br>content curation is no longer now just<br>the domain of universities<br>it's the wrap around and how it's<br>delivered and how it's made<br>real and applied that really matters<br>and that's done best on campus<br>in groups with other people with the<br>whole experience that goes with that<br>so from my point of view and from many<br>other people's point of view<br>we will find ways to have a physical<br>experience the physical and the digital<br>experience<br>in our blended way through the benefits<br>of a university campus experience at the<br>same time<br>as offering our students the opportunity<br>to be<br>working through work integrated learning<br>and learning on the job<br>in other ways so this is and this is<br>what<br>the students are expecting these days<br>and this is of course what's going to<br>help them<br>to really settle into long-term<br>employment so you're going to have<br>students streaming back<br>onto campus very shortly did you imagine<br>there might have been a moment where<br>this wouldn't have happened only a very<br>few weeks ago<br>so we've always been optimistic that<br>we'd be able to get our students back<br>onto campus for semester two<br>but a few weeks ago you know it was very<br>touch and go we're starting to<br>think will we get down into level three<br>alert and what will happen at the level<br>two alert<br>and we've been planning and planning<br>we've had an excellent team working on<br>this<br>matrix as we started to think about what<br>each level would look like for the<br>students returning health and safety<br>being the priority of course for staff<br>and students and the community<br>but beyond that really wanting to make<br>sure<br>that the experience was all that they'd<br>hoped for and more<br>and that the staff were also really<br>feeling enthusiastic and committed to<br>being<br>back on campus and engaged with the<br>student cohorts again<br>and that includes our research students<br>who'd whose field work had been<br>completely demolished through not being<br>able to do that in the covered lockdown<br>dawn you've talked in the past about how<br>ambitious you are<br>for universities per se so<br>did you grow up believing that<br>university would<br>play a critical role in your life i had<br>no idea i don't think<br>when i was younger i really understood<br>what universities did<br>i i was somebody who left school very<br>young<br>and did the best i could with my<br>gcses at the time didn't put a huge<br>amount of effort in because i was<br>distracted and doing other things with<br>my family<br>but actually i you know i sort of along<br>the way had<br>very good mentors who saw something in<br>me<br>that i didn't necessarily see in myself<br>and encouraged well and i think this is<br>something i still you know look at now i<br>i hadn't really ever considered that i<br>might be somebody who<br>was able to be a scholar<br>to apply that in a way that would really<br>not only help other people's life but to<br>help other people to grow<br>but i do having got the mental health<br>background that i have i now very much<br>see that i am somebody who's really keen<br>to watch other people<br>achieve their full potential and that's<br>what some people did for me along the<br>way<br>you grew up in provincial england<br>so what was it like growing up in<br>nottingham in the 70s<br>well i came so i was a mining town<br>before mining sort of was destroyed<br>really<br>but you know that was similar to the<br>revolutions and evolutions that are<br>happening now<br>in technology uh it was a very<br>interesting<br>uh town to be growing up in lace<br>featured heavily<br>right in nottingham as as did many other<br>things<br>in terms of what was happening in the<br>environment but what i recall about it<br>very happily actually is with my family<br>being sort of um caught up in a<br>mining community a community<br>where very down to earth<br>very grounded safe to play out on the<br>streets<br>social mobility not very much<br>was that an issue for you i<br>on reflection and i've thought about<br>this a lot<br>um i i always felt that i wanted to do<br>more<br>be more explore more express<br>more um to expand and i think that was<br>an issue for me<br>and certainly you know i felt very<br>motivated<br>from a very early age but all the way<br>through my life<br>to to expand and<br>advance and enhance and always hungry to<br>learn more<br>and you became a caregiver to your<br>certainly your mother who<br>suffered from mental health issues quite<br>severe ones at an early age<br>and looking after two younger brothers<br>what did that experience do to you<br>well i think if other people would<br>describe me as being born walking<br>right i became very responsible very<br>early on and<br>and now i realize that's a very<br>important skill to have<br>but not necessarily the skills that<br>you would want to have really so young<br>because in some ways of course i lost<br>quite a bit of my<br>early years in terms of the ability to<br>play<br>and to be playful and to be creative in<br>different ways so<br>it's um perentified yes and<br>yeah and when i think about caregivers<br>and there are many now of course we see<br>this is a real issue not just for people<br>caring for their parents<br>but having to care for multiple<br>generations<br>simultaneously and and those people also<br>want to study and why shouldn't they<br>so you know this is i feel very<br>passionate about that this was<br>a great opportunity for me coming out of<br>that environment<br>to also learn about my context and to<br>understand it<br>in a way that helped me to frame it<br>differently<br>nursing it seems like a choice that came<br>pretty naturally given what was<br>happening in your family background<br>yes so i learned to care very early and<br>it was something i'd always wanted to<br>i'd always wanted to be a nurse<br>and i had to sit the entrance test<br>to get i'm very proud of this i should<br>say i had to sit the entrance<br>test to get into the profession because<br>i had left school at 15.<br>so most of the people in fact every<br>other person in the cohort that i joined<br>had come through the a-level route and i<br>sat the entrance test and passed the<br>entrance test<br>to be able to get in and worked so<br>hard to make sure that i didn't fail<br>anything<br>during that training it was just so<br>important to me<br>and even now i can you know it's it's<br>several decades ago i still can look<br>back<br>and have the experience the feeling of<br>being<br>going on to the ward the first day<br>and feeling you know that it was just<br>the most<br>magical opportunity do you think<br>what occurred what happened in your<br>private life made you try harder<br>than others that drove you because<br>i i suppose the other other part of your<br>background<br>dawn which um seems frankly kind of<br>exhausting is that<br>you became a marathon runner as as as<br>you got older<br>which again denotes somebody who is<br>utterly driven<br>is that how you would describe yourself<br>yeah and i think i think it's fair to<br>say that<br>um and i think it's been in peaks and<br>troughs as well<br>thankfully but i think it is fair to say<br>that and there has been a huge amount<br>from my past that has driven some of<br>those<br>i'm pushing myself to<br>you know just to know what would this be<br>like<br>am i capable of this how could could<br>this happen<br>and i've often imagined myself into<br>situations<br>and then thought what that could happen<br>imagining myself<br>being in the vice-chancellor's role at<br>the university of auckland you know<br>and then making it happen so it's it's<br>it's<br>it's an interesting sort of um<br>clash here because on the one hand i<br>sort of feel<br>this was something that i'd never dreamt<br>was in my reach<br>but on the other hand i was actually<br>very driven<br>and imagining myself being able to do<br>these sorts of things so<br>you know a push pull there so how does<br>that translate into the way you think<br>about making tertiary education<br>more available to people who don't come<br>from<br>traditional backgrounds where education<br>is prized<br>or fostered at home yeah so obviously i<br>feel really passionate about that and<br>and have i feel it's my duty and my<br>responsibility<br>in the leadership role such as the one i<br>have<br>to really work to ensure that as many<br>people as possible<br>have the opportunity to<br>not just in higher education but have<br>the opportunity<br>through education to provide themselves<br>with more choices<br>in life that's one of the biggest things<br>we give people we give people<br>choices that they perhaps didn't really<br>believe they had or weren't aware<br>were there and so for me that's part of<br>you know my obligation if you like<br>in payback uh from my own experience<br>coming through the opportunities i've<br>had<br>and we do have to take them as well so<br>it cannot just be that somebody else<br>spots them we do have to take them<br>and that takes courage so yes i'm driven<br>and it requires courage to take those<br>opportunities and to step outside<br>of our comfort zone and to take the risk<br>of<br>it maybe not being quite what we thought<br>so<br>all of those things are part of an<br>education<br>bringing people into tertiary education<br>and helping them to see<br>no matter what their background is no<br>matter what their<br>age is actually this is an opportunity<br>for them<br>and it's up to them how they use it<br>medicine must have been and still is<br>dear i said<br>a highly hierarchical uh profession<br>with nursing of course being female<br>dominated<br>certainly in the years that you were<br>going through it<br>what kinds of changes did you experience<br>during that time and were they positive<br>ones<br>yes so it's um actually it's very<br>different now we see<br>um in many courses more than 50 percent<br>of those courses now the medical<br>programs are<br>females going into the medical correct<br>that certainly wasn't the case<br>when i went into nursing in 1980<br>and there certainly was the nurse doctor<br>game<br>it was written about in the literature<br>you know and<br>and partly that game was as the senior<br>nurse on the ward<br>knowing the patients<br>very much better often than a lot of the<br>doctors who were in and out and having<br>to move across different<br>parts of the hospital campus was really<br>trying to help the doctor to see what<br>the patient needed but as if the doctor<br>had<br>made the decision themselves and i'm<br>talking here very much<br>her and a hymn which goes back to your<br>question<br>it was very evident and it was something<br>that was<br>the lived experience of many of my peers<br>for many years that that has radically<br>changed<br>and continues to change and it changes<br>the other way too i'm delighted to see<br>a better gender mix in the nursing<br>profession<br>and in the management teams that you're<br>part of these days<br>absolutely so that's something that i<br>feel is still work in progress<br>if you look at the top 100 universities<br>in the world<br>there are very few female vice<br>chancellors<br>there'd be few vice chancellors of color<br>and it you know and we could go on and<br>on in that sort of<br>vein and as we start to get beneath the<br>top 100 universes it becomes<br>it's different but when we think about<br>those universes that are research<br>intensive that are<br>in you know that status of world class<br>and are<br>really held in high esteem uh it becomes<br>very um difficult to really think about<br>how<br>how we can become more diverse in that<br>regard because many of those people<br>coming up through the pipeline are<br>coming up through<br>careers from several decades ago or<br>recent decades coming from that<br>tradition<br>i have to say it's a privilege and a<br>delight to be the first female vice<br>chancellor of the university of auckland<br>but the day we get to the point where<br>we're no longer saying first female<br>will be in a much better position why<br>did you choose to go into management<br>dawn why why did it it kind of lure you<br>and what was it that you wanted to<br>achieve by going<br>into a management role well actually i<br>didn't choose it i say that of course<br>there is some element of choice<br>i was very happily being a professor<br>running a research team<br>working in some really interesting areas<br>of mental health<br>youth suicide young offenders and<br>really quite a difficult end<br>of the wedge and i was approached about<br>taking up a head of school role<br>actually and that was at the university<br>of leeds<br>and i said oh no i'm not interested in<br>doing that<br>it would take me away from my research<br>anyway to cut the long story short i was<br>persuaded to go and meet with the people<br>in leeds<br>and i was curious<br>and so i which made i was curious about<br>what it would be like to be able to<br>actually<br>make a difference not just in terms of<br>my<br>research team or the the team that was<br>but actually<br>to be able to do that at at a level<br>which would have more<br>impact and more influence and<br>perhaps have them a bit more of a ripple<br>effect so i survived so i ended up in<br>the head of school role and i remember<br>carol the first day sitting in the<br>school<br>as the head of school and really<br>seriously saying well<br>okay i'm ahead of school now what does a<br>head of school do<br>which was clearly i had ideas about what<br>the head of school did i wouldn't have<br>been appointed<br>but it you know those thoughts i think<br>cross people's minds and we need to be<br>i think it's quite refreshing to be<br>honest about that and i learned very<br>quickly what head of school does<br>and that was the start of my management<br>career<br>so dawn it seems that you for quite some<br>time<br>have had to juggle a pretty hefty<br>job um certainly even in in the<br>beginning when you were<br>moving into formal education there was<br>there were family that you were dealing<br>with you were studying<br>and you were working so so how how on<br>earth do you fit<br>the life bit in well i guess<br>um as an academic<br>i would say this but reading and writing<br>is an absolute pleasure and so<br>when i was you know doing some of the<br>work around the edges of<br>writing up some of my research or<br>writing with the team<br>there's a huge amount of pleasure in<br>that and reading<br>you know there was a time when it would<br>would never have been a novel<br>that's a little bit more on the table<br>now but it would never have been a novel<br>of reading all of those great books<br>written by some of my peers that was<br>pleasurable<br>and actually i found that i could<br>and i didn't always have the right<br>balance i think i'm better now<br>at understanding that productivity<br>isn't 100 full-on work it's actually a<br>much better balance than that and i<br>would try to role model that now<br>to my staff so i didn't always have the<br>right balance but i did find<br>that absolutely sticking to my routine<br>of running and having the exercise and<br>using those things<br>as not only coping mechanisms but ways<br>of settling my thoughts of helping me to<br>clear some space and to de-clutter were<br>really important and i made sure that<br>they<br>were actually priority constantly<br>you are something of a globe-trotting<br>kind of<br>academic these days and i'm i'm<br>wondering is it<br>is it hard to be the foreigner turning<br>up at different<br>institutions particularly institutions<br>that are<br>as considerably important culturally<br>as a place like the university of<br>auckland yes<br>i think there's a simple answer to that<br>and i think it's important not to shy<br>away from that<br>there's always work to be done on the<br>ground no matter what your track record<br>is what my track record is what my<br>history is<br>both in debunking the myths that come<br>before you<br>but also a lot of work to do on the<br>ground in terms of really<br>trying to understand the environment as<br>i said earlier in in the interview<br>from the felt experience not the<br>theoretical<br>but the practical experience but also of<br>course there's high expectations<br>um these the institution the university<br>of auckland the institutions that i've<br>been part of in the past<br>really important community<br>institutions and part of the city<br>and part of the environment and so<br>there's a lot at stake actually<br>dawn i'm just going to remind our<br>audience again that we are taking<br>of course questions during this<br>zoom webinar and you can use the q and a<br>function on zoom and also use<br>the upvote to move those questions<br>up the chain as well i guess<br>when i think about the situation that<br>you find yourself<br>in here in auckland everybody is very<br>interested in understanding what your<br>priorities will be<br>in terms of specific objectives so do<br>you have a list<br>of specific objectives that you you<br>talked about your legacy<br>can you translate them into something<br>even more concrete for<br>our audience so what we're working on at<br>the moment and i use<br>the the we of course i have<br>some vision which is one of the reasons<br>that i'm here in the hope that we're<br>able to achieve that together<br>but really importantly i'm working with<br>the university community at the moment<br>in terms of defining those objectives<br>and that strategy<br>and some of that will require us to<br>really<br>think hard and nail our colours to the<br>mast in some of the areas of research<br>excellence that we already have<br>strengths in but that we<br>really want to enhance and complement so<br>that we are<br>able to translate that high quality<br>research into value<br>so examples of course we're already<br>really<br>excel in much of what we do in our<br>area of health and medical sciences<br>brain research is one of those we if we<br>think about what we're doing in terms of<br>the<br>in biomedical engineering there's work<br>that we can do to bring together what i<br>believe<br>and what many of my colleagues believe<br>and in fact<br>previously has been discussed as part of<br>the university's<br>thinking going forward a life science<br>innovation precinct<br>based here in auckland medtech<br>being a significant part of that<br>there are other things that we really<br>need to pay attention to we<br>are number one in the sustainable<br>development goals<br>and that's for the second year running<br>and the times higher education rankings<br>we didn't earn that for nothing we have<br>excellent opportunities to enhance our<br>agriculture<br>aquaculture and particularly agritech<br>and of course that's important to the<br>nation and thinking about the ways in<br>which we look at not just climate change<br>but<br>water being very topical and marine<br>science is one of the areas that we also<br>are really world class in and they're<br>just some of the things that we're<br>looking at at the moment<br>but all of those with a view to thinking<br>about<br>their grand challenges for the globe<br>right now whether it's energy<br>whether it's food security and<br>agriculture agriculture whether it's<br>water<br>grand challenges what are the specific<br>issues the particular issues<br>that we can bring to bear in terms of<br>helping to think those problems<br>and bring solutions innovative solutions<br>to our communities here<br>and in the pacific and then guide<br>the rest of the globe in terms of the<br>ways in which we contribute to those<br>that is a significant slate of work of<br>course<br>that you're outlining so we've got at<br>least a<br>half year of academic year to run what<br>will be the focus of your priorities<br>over the next half year<br>so we really do need to focus on on<br>business recovery running alongside the<br>strategy<br>and those two things are running in<br>tandem at the moment so immediately of<br>course it's about the students coming<br>back to the campus<br>in a short time as you've indicated and<br>really making sure<br>that we rebuild that community on the<br>campus<br>and to ensure that the student<br>experience and<br>the learning and teaching which is a<br>significant part of that but the student<br>experience<br>is paramount we of course need to think<br>about<br>how we're going to manage our way beyond<br>the end of this year in terms of<br>recovery<br>of market shares that we've lost<br>internationally<br>as a result of some of the changes that<br>we've had to go through at the border<br>and and actually understanding what it<br>is that we need to provide<br>to our the upskilling<br>in the businesses in the community here<br>and<br>ensuring that people are prepared for<br>other careers given that we are likely<br>to see<br>a downturn in the economy as a result of<br>recent events and of course that has an<br>impact on employment security<br>so there are a number of things that<br>we're doing already around<br>providing upskilling opportunities micro<br>credentials<br>ways in which we can create bridges for<br>people to move careers very quickly and<br>we'll expect to see<br>an uptick in the terms of our<br>postgraduate<br>student numbers coming in from from<br>people who are really wanting to shift<br>careers<br>postcovid so all of those things are on<br>the table<br>they need to be thought about<br>strategically so we can provide some<br>long-term planning around them dawn i'm<br>conscious of<br>a number of people submitting questions<br>as<br>i've been asking them to tonight and so<br>um i'd like to take this opportunity to<br>to now<br>turn our attention to some of those<br>questions before we run out of time<br>so i'm going to take our first one and<br>it<br>is a question that relates<br>in some ways to to what you are talking<br>about<br>it goes recently prime minister jacinda<br>dern encouraged<br>new zealanders experience experiencing<br>pandemic related unemployment to<br>consider further education<br>for many this is easier said than done<br>universities generally pitch their<br>e-services and learning programs to the<br>tech savvy youthful student<br>however there may now be more mature<br>students seeking a second chance to<br>study<br>if this is the case what changes can be<br>made at the university of auckland to<br>cater<br>for these more mature students so indeed<br>it segues quite well<br>of what you were just talking about and<br>in fact i've<br>had the opportunity to meet the prime<br>minister recently in wellington<br>and she asked me this question a very<br>similar<br>question to how do we make universities<br>more attractive<br>to mature students and and i would say<br>you know we have to think about this in<br>the context now<br>of multiple generations<br>in in employment in workplaces and<br>multiple generations in universities<br>you've talked cradle to grave approach<br>to<br>education that's right and so we have to<br>be attractive<br>to a whole range a whole continuum of<br>people who are wanting to perhaps dip<br>their toes in<br>and other people are perhaps looking for<br>something more long-term<br>universities are not necessarily and<br>particularly research-intensive<br>universities<br>such as the university of auckland but<br>it's not just peculiar to the university<br>of auckland<br>we're not always seen as particularly<br>porous<br>institutions to mature students<br>and i think this is not just about<br>marketing and it isn't just about<br>the pitch it is also about us really<br>doing some work on helping people to<br>understand<br>what we can offer and how they can<br>engage with us in ways that really suit<br>them and their lifestyle<br>and the other sort of obligations that<br>they have<br>that they're also trying to meet we need<br>to also make<br>what we're doing relevant so you know<br>examples where i was talking earlier<br>about micro credentials<br>stackable credentials opportunities for<br>mature students to continue to work<br>but something that they can do that is<br>asynchronous you know at a time when it<br>suits them and allows them to be able to<br>access<br>and do small bite-sized chunks of<br>credits which they can stack up<br>to something that might end up as a<br>master's program a master's<br>qualification or an undergraduate<br>qualification or it may not<br>yeah and i think that's the other thing<br>is people understanding that<br>universities are not just simply<br>about undergraduate and postgraduate<br>qualifications they're much broader than<br>that<br>you talked actually earlier about the<br>need for the university to engage with<br>schools so at the mature<br>student end how do you see that<br>engagement possibly happening<br>well one of the things of course i admit<br>when you said that i immediately thought<br>about teacher education actually<br>and i was thinking about the way in<br>which it's so important<br>for our teachers and educators these<br>days in schools to have the opportunity<br>for continuous professional development<br>that's both relevant but also is really<br>helping them<br>to be able to manage the changing<br>demographic and the changing<br>expectations of students that they're<br>dealing with<br>that would be one example i'm going to<br>move to our next question dawn knowing<br>you have a background in mental health<br>how can<br>auckland university influence the mental<br>health issues<br>here in new zealand very good question<br>and i think as somebody who has a mental<br>health background<br>and with the position i have it provides<br>an opportunity to really<br>speak to that agenda as often<br>and with as much influence as i possibly<br>can because<br>not simply are we dealing with because<br>we're dealing with actually a big shift<br>in mental health issues and<br>some of those because of course we're<br>much more able to talk about them but<br>also because we're<br>experiencing a very significant anxiety<br>anxiety<br>pandemic i would describe it but also<br>because<br>as universities think about this you<br>know however big we are whether we have<br>40 000 students or 20 000 students or 5<br>000 students<br>these are all people whose minds<br>and whose you know activities are part<br>of<br>our daily work and we need to think<br>about how we support them<br>how we help them to grow into resilient<br>people resilient citizens how they<br>understand their responsibility as<br>citizens to each other<br>and facilitating that in the university<br>is both an internal<br>role that we have and one that i need to<br>be<br>leading but also role modelling for<br>external environments so that you know<br>our students do feel<br>that that pastoral care and the support<br>that they're getting is really helping<br>them<br>to navigate their way through their<br>studies in a way that prepares them for<br>life<br>and and that's something i think we<br>should offer<br>to society so so do you see<br>at a personal level that one of your key<br>roles will be to be<br>a very visible advocate for<br>mental health research and mental health<br>services<br>absolutely and that's why i talk openly<br>about coming from the family background<br>that i've come from<br>also i i will say to people you know<br>mental illness is a continuum and we're<br>all on it<br>it's just the degree to which it's<br>impacting us and the degree to which<br>it informs and influences our lives and<br>the degree to which it interferes with<br>us<br>to achieve all that we're capable of<br>our next question and an important one<br>how do you propose<br>to manage the deep financial hole the<br>university of<br>auckland currently finds itself in so<br>and<br>this is um really very topical at the<br>moment of course because<br>it's an issue for universities worldwide<br>some of it relating to the business<br>model i will go back to the strategy and<br>the business recovery comments i made<br>earlier<br>so fortunately for the university we are<br>in the position<br>of being at the front end of developing<br>a new strategy and making<br>decisions about where we will invest<br>and what we will disinvest in and<br>also in terms of business recovery<br>identifying where we have opportunities<br>and so growing revenue of course is one<br>angle of that<br>but there are also other things we need<br>to do we need to think about ways in<br>which we can be more efficient and<br>effective<br>and we may also need to think about what<br>we have to<br>contract in and that that actually is<br>what<br>good uh you know in terms of our<br>business<br>and we are also a business as well as a<br>social enterprise<br>it's what we have to balance up always<br>it's just that it's much more acute now<br>postcoded<br>this may well be our last uh dawn i'm<br>just keeping an eye on<br>the clock but given the current<br>environment how important<br>is it to compete on an international<br>stage should we be focusing<br>on new zealand whatever the environment<br>we need to make sure<br>that we are absolutely addressing<br>our communities both in new zealand<br>and in auckland and and in our region<br>but we should also have an eye to what's<br>happening internationally because<br>we are not only influenced by that we<br>also<br>influence that and this so this is<br>as much about making sure that there is<br>that flow<br>we are a knowledge organization<br>and it's really important that we think<br>of ourselves<br>as as such because we share that<br>knowledge we use that knowledge<br>to improve lives we can we do that and<br>we get it tested out<br>and people check themselves against it<br>internationally<br>and that informs our thinking advances<br>our thinking critiques our thinking more<br>so we have to make sure that we are both<br>in and outside of that<br>environment both external internal in<br>order to really understand and keep<br>moving<br>in a way that informs society that we<br>are both<br>invented by society and we<br>invent it so important to have that<br>connection i'm going to sneak one final<br>question<br>in and it is staying with the idea<br>of staying close to home kia ora dawn it<br>is great to hear how open and willing<br>you are<br>to learning more about teal maori i'm<br>interested to hear about what steps you<br>are actively taking to increase<br>your knowledge and awareness well so i'm<br>fresh from the universities rananga<br>today<br>and it was a delightful meeting and<br>experience<br>and it was wonderful to have<br>the hui there with the rananga so i'm<br>working very closely<br>with my pro vice chancellor maori but<br>also<br>regularly working on cultural education<br>in fact i had a lovely hikoi<br>recently to learn some of the local<br>environmental history<br>and doing as much as i can to immerse<br>myself in that and i'm actually<br>one of the things that's on the agenda<br>is<br>engaging and meeting with the ewe and<br>hapu so a lot happening in that regard<br>and and it's an absolute pleasure<br>and dawn i think that provides an<br>excellent<br>point for our conclusion to this<br>conversation<br>thank you so much for your openness and<br>your readiness to share<br>about your experiences this evening<br>and to those of you who have tuned in as<br>well<br>we'd like to thank you for your presence<br>and<br>for your appreciation of our session<br>if you want to view the session again or<br>share it with anyone else<br>you can find it on the alumni website<br>but in the meantime thank you and good<br>evening<br>good evening thank you thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
