everyone we'd like to welcome you<br>to this webinar today about how the<br>sport and human performance so we're<br>going to talk today about The Bachelor<br>of a house for Human Performance Program<br>really briefly and then we are wanting<br>to talk about The Bachelor of Health and<br>Human Performance papers that are<br>running and total men and tries to be my<br>name is Maya cosgrove and I'm - who<br>attack ey hora the school of health and<br>joining me today are Sheree and Mike<br>from just introduce themselves know so<br>just to give a little bit of context for<br>our presentation about the two papers<br>that are we are offering here in Toronto<br>this trimester but when I start my<br>introducing the venture of how<br>supporting Human Performance to you just<br>in case you're thinking of enrolling in<br>that or you are already enrolled in it<br>the degree is a three degree and as you<br>can see here and just in this degree is<br>about growing knowledgeable individuals<br>who will in turn be able to contribute<br>to the communities of altaira New<br>Zealand so we are aiming to build<br>leaders and health and science and<br>social development so things to do a<br>sport to do with health to do with<br>policy to do with physical activity<br>we're also intending to build leaders<br>who can contribute in the education<br>coaching and management fields or into<br>community health and well-being and<br>another key thread that runs through the<br>degree the order degree program is Mari<br>own indigenous ways of knowing so just<br>again a little bit more context for us<br>talking about the two papers and tirana<br>what's really important to note and you<br>can see here by the three of us<br>presenting today as their entire honor<br>the Metra of house sport and humor forms<br>is jointly delivered by<br>University of Waikato and 12 all mine<br>Institute of Technology so what that<br>means through this collaboration is<br>their students and our papers get to<br>expose to lecturers and staff from both<br>institutes and can really draw on the<br>expertise that's often through this<br>partnership which is pretty exciting for<br>all of us one more thing just before we<br>move on to talk more directly about the<br>two papers like other degrees The<br>Bachelor of Health and Human Performance<br>has got eight members a year 24 papers<br>and total and the reason why we thought<br>to be useful to maybe start and provide<br>a little bit of context about are the<br>degree for this particular presentation<br>is there the two papers that we're going<br>to talk about today well this one here<br>has some 102 the fundamentals of<br>coaching and instruction in STC a when I<br>went in here they have both core papers<br>and the degree so they are compulsory<br>for first-year students to do and that's<br>really important to note because they<br>provide a really important interactive<br>foundation for a whole lot of other<br>things that you didn't develop<br>irrespective of your whatever major you<br>choose and the degree the degree has<br>three majors sport development and<br>coaching human performance science and<br>community health and just to reiterate<br>that point no matter what major you end<br>up doing you do do both papers so that's<br>just a little bit of background about<br>the Bachelor of Health and Human<br>Performance for those of you who are<br>attending today who may be rolling<br>rolling the papers that we are talking<br>about today though it's awesome with<br>noting are available as elective papers<br>- from other degree programs which some<br>of you may be as well okay moving on<br>let's go more directly and to talk about<br>these papers and maybe fundamentals of<br>coaching and instructing and I think<br>those two talking in a context but I<br>think many of the skills that you learn<br>through the paper are realizing you can<br>see there and those their workshops are<br>down the queue I see and and climb hope<br>is the overall convener of this paper<br>Hamilton and mag and myself are the<br>deliverers of the workshops here in<br>Toronto he will have a range of<br>littering the during the paper and I'll<br>see you folks face some weak spine<br>actually come over to me so that's about<br>you my name is Sheree Cooper and I'll be<br>leading the workshops here in<br>in conjunction with Tom Cavanaugh<br>reservoir now professor Holly thought we<br>don't all be lectures and so on that is<br>a cool paper of the AG CHP and also<br>through our diploma in sport recreation<br>exercise students here internet it's<br>really about broadening your<br>sociological imagination and just taking<br>a step back from what sport appears to<br>be as to what it is and isn't and a<br>wonderful shade of gray as far as your<br>imagination goes so it's really coming<br>in with an open mind to look at what we<br>can explore the different facets there's<br>paper heads and sport cultural<br>development between some issues just<br>some images here just to sort of bring<br>at home about some of the facets within<br>that that we'll look at making sure that<br>you're ready to come with a cup that's<br>willing to be filled with your own<br>experiences that you can share and then<br>learning from the shared experience of<br>others as a mu so that's discussion<br>based and we want to make them nation<br>workshops where you are doing art of<br>thinking and presenting to really<br>broaden that sociological imagination so<br>as my concern about the previous paper<br>there are online lectures that you are<br>expected to view physically thumpers<br>wonderfully experienced in this domain<br>and she's the best of the best so<br>looking at what she offers and those<br>incredible notes that really an<br>exploring class between myself and Tom<br>we'll take you through that through that<br>exploration and then every Thursday<br>afternoon so really excited to be able<br>to work with you and I'm really looking<br>forward to launching a sociological<br>just this slide he was just to remind<br>people of where the tutorials are so<br>particularly on the right you can see<br>this is for stco a 101 paper as we see<br>with the fundamentals of coach<br>instruction we are off campus at the<br>Queen Elizabeth is Center for our<br>practical workshops which is my consider<br>and a really important part of this<br>paper<br>so just to wind up before we open for<br>any questions that you might have just a<br>couple of things to note that we have<br>division registrar's they are
