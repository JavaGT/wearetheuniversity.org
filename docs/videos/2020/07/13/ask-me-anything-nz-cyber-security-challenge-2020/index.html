are the host my name is vimal kumar i<br>am<br>the i'm a senior lecturer at the<br>university of waikato and i'm the head<br>of the cyber security lab here<br>with me co-host my co-host is dr abigail<br>coy who is a<br>research fellow at the crow lab um<br>now you would have noticed that there is<br>no particular<br>theme topic for this discussion that is<br>intentional we want to keep the<br>discussion<br>and interesting for the air force for a<br>wide audience<br>what we would do is we have a few<br>questions with us we'll post those<br>questions to the panelists<br>and after those questions uh uh we will<br>we will uh<br>make the floor open uh well if there's a<br>floor in<br>a uh online webinar uh<br>uh to the panelists um uh also oh well<br>uh<br>uh for the audience feel free to post uh<br>your questions<br>uh at uh um anytime<br>uh you can post your questions on the q<br>a uh<br>board sort of uh option that you would<br>see on your screens<br>and um yeah you can post the questions<br>at any point of time it's just uh it's<br>just<br>sort of a text-based uh um questions<br>um now we would pick up the question if<br>you think it goes with the flow of the<br>discussion we'll pick it up right away<br>and pose it to the panelists if it<br>if it's a relevant question but it<br>doesn't go with the flow of the<br>of the discussion we will pick it up<br>later<br>right so um now i think to note uh this<br>is a zoom webinar so<br>uh the audience can only post questions<br>on the q<br>and a um and um so we will be monitoring<br>that<br>the audience cannot post um<br>ask questions right away uh using their<br>microphone<br>anyway okay so uh now let me<br>introduce uh uh the panel our guests<br>here<br>first off we have um the chief<br>security officer uh at of internet nz<br>sam<br>sergeant um uh sam has worked with<br>all things internet uh in new zealand<br>since 1990<br>and before his current role uh he has<br>been the cto and cio of various private<br>and political organizations<br>here in new zealand welcome sam thank<br>you<br>then from australia we have uh lee<br>mcquarter who<br>is a senior systems engineer at rsa<br>security<br>lee received a bachelor of computer<br>science with majors in computer<br>forensics<br>and systems programming from western<br>sydney university and has been in cyber<br>security for<br>the last 10 years welcome lee<br>we have sorry sorry to cut you off<br>uh we also have um uh david treasurer<br>from<br>uh aura information security david uh<br>has a bachelor of network engineering<br>from victoria<br>uh david is or a technical lead for a<br>number of<br>their wellington-based enterprise<br>customers and<br>uh david also manages aura's internship<br>program<br>which would be of uh uh of of<br>interest to a lot of our attendees hey<br>is a senior security consultant at<br>insomnia and he has a masters of<br>information security and digital<br>forensics<br>from aut his expertise is in web and<br>mobile application and testing with a<br>specific interest in social engineering<br>pen testing tool development and<br>physical control<br>based testing right so<br>uh welcome everyone and uh thank you<br>for uh coming here and taking time out<br>um on a saturday<br>um so uh so let's get into it<br>abigail oh yes so uh thank you all for<br>coming and those attending um so let's<br>start with the first question is about<br>the roles<br>so what does a cyber security person<br>like yourself<br>on a day-to-day basis so what do you do<br>um what does daily life in the cyber<br>security<br>i'm i'm happy to kick off uh so as chief<br>security officer i<br>am quite lucky that i get to go up and<br>down the stack i get to think about some<br>of our<br>big picture strategy or some of our more<br>operational<br>details of course in this industry<br>plans on a daily basis can change<br>external actors will drive things<br>and so perhaps we're we're running an<br>incident response<br>we're in a war room type situation uh<br>but more day-to-day i might be doing<br>budget meetings or<br>a governance type steering meeting to<br>check in on progress<br>okay this is a management site so how<br>as a pen tester obviously um most of it<br>is keeping up to date<br>so reading a lot and and uh<br>keeping on top of the news look at<br>some trends and what's happening um<br>most of my day-to-day is communicating<br>with clients<br>um either there or or doing research<br>into new capabilities uh for insomnia<br>and uh hacking stuff i mean you know<br>it's part of pen testing<br>um and also the uh the not so uh<br>nice side of it there's the writing<br>report at the end of it<br>yeah report is a crucial part so what<br>about you lee<br>so i work as a security engineer in<br>pre-sales<br>so randy providing things like technical<br>assistance to new<br>and existing customers in for new<br>zealand and australian customers<br>for one of the products that we sell<br>which is called rsa net witness<br>platform this is a threat protection and<br>response<br>product used by security operation<br>centres<br>of organizations to do things like<br>perform<br>infinite response and network forensic<br>security<br>uh incident and event management see<br>them and uh<br>throw it handy so essentially what do i<br>do day to day uh<br>so i'm a customer facing specialists<br>rather than a<br>security analyst per se but much of my<br>day-to-day uh consists of<br>uh delivering technical presentations to<br>explain the products how how our<br>products and services<br>can assist customers and i guess<br>uh qualifying opportunities for three<br>section response solutions<br>architecting uh various solutions and i<br>guess providing<br>sales support uh for product<br>demonstration<br>using doing such such things as product<br>demonstrations<br>and things like that across some of our<br>larger customers working on um<br>you know uh critical infrastructure and<br>things like that um<br>as well as i also manage a team so i<br>have the<br>the joys of um uh helping uh my staff<br>you know do their uh projects but um i<br>guess the the most enjoyment<br>that i get is um uh out of uh<br>hacking things yeah so i do um security<br>testing i do pin testing<br>um and yeah you know uh there's<br>there's nothing quite as satisfying as<br>sinking your teeth into<br>um you know kind of this big uh project<br>and you know identifying um<br>you know security issues and the<br>complexities that lie there whether it<br>be with<br>you know authentication or whatever um<br>but then also um<br>you know i'm presenting those findings<br>to people like sam<br>as well as um you know kind of the<br>low-level technical people who will be<br>um actually going to resolve issues so<br>uh yeah it's you know kind of a blend of<br>everything really<br>thanks david so talking about security<br>issues<br>so um tell us about uh<br>what are the kind of securities issues<br>you see face to face and how do you keep<br>yeah david yeah yeah okay i'll jump in<br>on that so um<br>yeah um it's a it's a big mix um i'd say<br>some of it<br>come sometimes it comes down to sort of<br>um developers who maybe are not um aware<br>of how<br>they need to be writing secure code and<br>things like that a lot of um<br>has changed a lot in the last i know<br>kind of ten years as<br>frameworks um our program frameworks<br>have made it<br>more straightforward for people to um<br>implement security kind of by design and<br>they're um by default<br>um but i'd say a lot of um the issues<br>that we identify are uh<br>either kind of developers not knowing<br>what they're doing or infrastructure<br>people who<br>um maybe they don't have good process<br>around patching and things like that um<br>you kind of you read a bunch about it in<br>the news like um<br>yeah that people would get compromised<br>from really silly things<br>often we'll find that it's it's kind of<br>the thing that people have forgotten<br>about way over in the corner that um<br>maybe have some some security issues in<br>it but yeah it kind of covers all of the<br>all of the you know different areas of<br>um of organizations whether it be kind<br>of<br>uh yeah we web-based issues or<br>infrastructure-based issues or<br>um people-based issues we do a lot of um<br>kind of uh<br>fishing style engagements as well um<br>simulations and<br>kind of yeah so sort of you name it and<br>if you've read about it in the news then<br>chances are<br>that's kind of what we're finding um do<br>you<br>do you um take a piece of uh look at a<br>piece of software that hasn't been<br>touched now<br>in a long time and say hmm yeah yeah<br>find something there<br>yeah that sort of has i describe it as<br>like a smell um so yeah you kind of you<br>might look at something and<br>you can often tell just within the first<br>sort of three minutes of using it<br>whether<br>you know um whether it's a modern<br>framework and um<br>the way that it looks or kind of the<br>workflows of like an<br>application or you know um yeah<br>it stuff has smells and um you know<br>sometimes it smells pretty bad and<br>you're kind of like okay well<br>i'm gonna need to spend a bit more you<br>know leave a bit more time for the<br>report writing at the end because<br>this one's gonna be a big one yeah yes<br>so lee you mentioned about threat<br>hunting so how do you<br>do that what are the most like the<br>issues top issues you see in threat<br>hunting<br>sort of threats so i i guess the um<br>top issues in threat handling is i guess<br>trying to<br>narrow down what you're looking for i<br>guess<br>the challenges that a lot of security<br>operation centres have<br>is as an analyst you've got all these<br>alerts coming in from all these<br>different sources whether that's<br>logs packets net flow<br>and endpoints and how do you actually<br>bring all of those together to<br>triage them to work out what's important<br>and what's not so<br>basically to try and reduce down the the<br>high to increase the signal to noise<br>ratio<br>essentially so i guess the<br>what i see is a lot of customers kind of<br>struggle retaining<br>skilled talent to actually run tools<br>like this<br>and to have the processes in place to<br>make sure that the threat hunting is<br>effective and useful so i guess<br>yeah making sure that uh there's a<br>pool of um skilled talent in order to do<br>the script hunting is probably the<br>challenge that most<br>customers face<br>how about you uh what's the security<br>issue from the<br>um top management point of view we<br>we also have the same challenges um that<br>lee was talking about retaining<br>and attracting the the right people the<br>the right mindset to get into security<br>and be effective and what might be a<br>small team<br>uh we also have some of the the same<br>issues that david talked about where<br>some<br>software you look at and you think<br>something's not right here and it's<br>often a cultural thing from the<br>developers they<br>they've got a job to do they are going<br>to implement their feature and be done<br>with it<br>but helping them understand to think<br>like an attacker<br>don't just tick the box the customer<br>wants this feature<br>how are you going to defend against<br>someone else in the future<br>trying to break your system and trying<br>to help developers<br>think about that approach helps them<br>make more secure<br>code and so we spend a bit of time<br>trying to do that work proactively<br>before something goes wrong<br>to help prepare us and get it get us in<br>good shape<br>yeah i mean i would just kind of add on<br>top of what david and sam were talking<br>about i mean<br>it really is about you know taking a<br>look at it<br>as a as a whole uh so i'd say<br>in terms of security issues like we're<br>still if you go and take a look at the<br>oauth top 10<br>we you know we're still seeing that but<br>there are<br>really good frameworks out there for<br>software development and when when<br>um i think sam mentioned the culture<br>when those<br>are followed they make my job harder<br>which is which is a good thing um<br>and definitely in terms of other<br>security issues obviously<br>like we're doing this virtually there's<br>you know<br>a huge rush to you know cloud remote<br>based<br>you know vpns those sort of things uh<br>and so a heavier reliance on<br>uh infrastructure is probably something<br>that i've seen<br>you know quite recently in terms of<br>um things that need a little more focus<br>so um the last question for about your<br>role<br>so besides hacking reports like checking<br>out all the things that's happening so<br>what other<br>um interesting things that you have you<br>are doing at the<br>something something you are really<br>i mean you go no sorry<br>um i mean i i<br>uh like just just uh on um<br>uh what day of the week is it again<br>thursday friday<br>uh that i was<br>looking at um like increasing our<br>capability<br>for uh rfid uh you know security tag<br>cloning<br>and uh looking at how we can turn that<br>into a long-range scanner<br>um so that we can gain access to<br>buildings and<br>and you know this sort of thing so so<br>like those research<br>areas are always something<br>really exciting you take something an<br>idea that's way out<br>there and actually try and implement it<br>um you know it is always good fun you're<br>always learning something<br>so that is interesting i mean<br>as yeah as a cyber security person or an<br>as an engineer you you're always looking<br>to<br>break things and then remake them that's<br>that's what interests me that's what<br>excites me<br>yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah<br>definitely uh<br>and and i think you learn a lot in the<br>process of of breaking something down<br>and then trying to to build it up from<br>um anyone else wanted to talk about<br>this okay so let's move on to the next<br>topic which is um current event so<br>yeah so um i just wanted to ask ask<br>about<br>uh you know your your um uh all from the<br>uh cyber security uh<br>industry so what are the<br>um some of the current trends that<br>you're seeing<br>in um in security out there and and how<br>is it<br>evolving<br>so i'll take a shot the first one um<br>we're seeing governments cooperate more<br>and publishing indicators of compromise<br>and sometimes ones they will attribute<br>to specific<br>groups or even other nations you're<br>seeing more and more<br>these advanced persistent threats their<br>tooling<br>being published on virustotal you know<br>that's something that<br>is is not something we thought of five<br>years ago and it's definitely<br>i think going to be more of a trend<br>we're going to see more of those<br>governments<br>it is interesting that you mentioned the<br>attribution piece there i'd say that's<br>in terms of the big things that's<br>probably what's changed recently like if<br>we look at what<br>um uh new zealand's partners overseas<br>um in terms of how they've been<br>identifying and actually naming<br>the the threat is um and then you look<br>at the likes of the us who have actually<br>been<br>you know identifying individuals and and<br>talking about them i think that's<br>um that's<br>a lot um they've had a lot more teeth to<br>it yeah it's kind of a scary<br>much scarier place for the for the for<br>those three actors to be when now<br>they've got the<br>the kind of the added risk of you know<br>their face is going to end up on a most<br>wanted<br>list and you know kind of hears all of<br>the old passport photos that are being<br>tracked up<br>um i'd say um just in terms of current<br>trends something that i've<br>um we've seen in new zealand um as well<br>as internationally<br>recently is kind of this evolving um<br>ransomware<br>where it's no longer just somebody you<br>know compromises an exposed smv share or<br>something like that and encrypts all of<br>your<br>your company's files they actually they<br>compromise and then they'll spend<br>you know weeks or months um sifting<br>through all of the<br>data and slowly compromising everything<br>and then they pull off all of your<br>sensitive data and then<br>um you know then after only after<br>they've kind of you know got all of they<br>can from your network they'll go and<br>encrypt everything<br>but the ransom the threat isn't just you<br>know<br>pay us some bitcoin um you know give us<br>our three btc<br>so that will disrupt all your files it's<br>um<br>and if you don't then we're gonna<br>publish all of your sensitive documents<br>online<br>um and and they've actually followed<br>through on those threats as well so<br>they um got picked up by the media uh<br>i'm trying to remember who it was it was<br>a celebrity of some description who had<br>um<br>uh relationship with the legal firm and<br>the i might have been<br>i want to say lady gaga um could be<br>wrong but<br>um yeah either way they so and they<br>publish some some<br>like legal documents relating to this<br>person and and then<br>more recently we've seen it in new<br>zealand with um<br>fisher and pikal um they had financial<br>documents leaked<br>um you know based off this ransomware<br>threat and so it's kind of i'd say um<br>we're seeing sort of these old um<br>uh you know kind of malware um types<br>evolve to try and i mean you know<br>they've realized that people now<br>know that they need to back their stuff<br>up and that you know they need to be<br>watching for these threats but<br>um you know kind of having having good<br>backups isn't going to save you if<br>they're going to post all of your<br>financial information<br>or you know some of your really<br>sensitive intellectual property online<br>um and so they're kind of they're adding<br>to the to the um<br>shall we say incentive to go and<br>actually pay those ransoms<br>which has been quite interesting yeah so<br>um now you mentioned uh naming<br>the threat actors so australia recently<br>just stopped<br>and so yeah so the australian<br>governments and industries uh<br>as as the press conference uh event um<br>are being targeted by um some state<br>actor<br>and uh uh in new zealand we're sort of<br>all uh in<br>in a lot of areas we look up to um you<br>know<br>what's being done in australia and uh so<br>with okay so from<br>from that point of view what do you<br>think is the preparedness of<br>uh of the new zealand government<br>and businesses to something like what is<br>being described as happening in<br>australia<br>it's i think it's getting better uh<br>you look at the reporting that certain<br>zed is publishing<br>and ncsc there the the levels of<br>preparedness the awareness<br>at all levels of organizations is<br>definitely improving<br>and that's great it needs to go in that<br>direction i would say it's not going<br>fast enough<br>and you know you look at some of the the<br>simple compromises that have happened by<br>you know a targeted<br>attack on a tax company<br>their software ends up crippling the<br>world's largest shipping<br>company you know these cause and effects<br>one day are gonna wrap up in a new<br>zealand company just imagine if<br>the ty aluminium smelter unexpectedly<br>closed one day what that would do to the<br>security of<br>our uh electricity market so<br>i fear that it's not quite good enough<br>yet and we're going to have a hard<br>lesson at some point when something goes<br>wrong<br>before we put in the real hard yards<br>that's required<br>right oh sorry<br>i i think it's true like over time we've<br>seen the changing profile from<br>attackers from say curious hackers that<br>are just exploring systems to<br>more financially driven attackers and um<br>those and say nation states that are<br>not necessarily looking for financial<br>incentives that are looking for<br>information that might<br>progress their their country's<br>progression to technological progression<br>so or even<br>information from political gain so<br>i think uh in in subsecuting we've kind<br>of been working on things<br>that uh term called ttp which is their<br>tactics<br>techniques and procedures to model<br>attackers<br>um to to actually see<br>how that how your thrift section<br>response maps to<br>the the ttp that your attackers that you<br>see<br>using and so that you can<br>work out where in their campaign that<br>you can<br>see where you can detect and respond to<br>each of their<br>steps so i guess as the attackers get<br>more professional<br>the teams in the security operations<br>centers on the defense side need to also<br>make sure that they've got tools the<br>policies and the procedures in order to<br>be able to effectively perform<br>intimate response so yeah i think uh<br>you know the the threat is getting<br>larger<br>but also on the defense side we're<br>getting<br>better tools and better processes that<br>allow us to do that<br>respond more effectively in timely<br>fashion<br>right okay uh so follow-up question uh<br>to sam<br>um so you talked about the<br>awareness and the preparedness is<br>increasing<br>now the the the state of um<br>uh the current uh preparedness how<br>would you attribute that to how<br>um uh the i mean the industry in new<br>zealand which is mostly<br>small to medium enterprises you you you<br>give an example of<br>uh rio um um the spelter<br>um and and they're they're quite large<br>by uh<br>new zealand standards um but so is<br>is the is the is the current state of<br>preparedness<br>um is one of the attributes can it also<br>be attributed to<br>you know our our industry our<br>organizations our companies being<br>really small and therefore not<br>understanding<br>the um uh how they can be<br>attacked i think that that could be part<br>of it i think<br>i see it though in all sizes of of<br>organization it's those big ones that<br>seem to<br>obviously hurt the most when something<br>goes wrong and they then react with that<br>right investment<br>i don't think small businesses sometimes<br>can imagine<br>you know being forced to close for<br>months and months at a time<br>for example due to events outside of<br>your control<br>that's obvious in hindsight we can say a<br>pandemic has done that but what if it's<br>your computers don't work anymore and<br>all your data is gone and you have no<br>ability to get it back<br>i think it's it's imagination about what<br>could go wrong and it seems the only way<br>we can learn that is by<br>experiencing it going wrong in the first<br>place it's very hard to<br>balance that risk and make a big<br>trade-off you know why do i have to have<br>this longer password nothing's ever gone<br>wrong<br>why do i have to wear a seat belt it's<br>just a pain<br>so um from from the point of view of<br>um of tertiary institutions and academia<br>how do you think we can help<br>in in getting that awareness<br>so i'll quickly add a few things one is<br>is<br>um helping us understand that risk<br>discussion you know long-term risk<br>people are a really poor understanding<br>that<br>how can we actually think about the real<br>consequences<br>that an action might lead to if i don't<br>secure my things properly<br>what really could go wrong and helping<br>you know<br>output the next generation of students<br>who have that systemic thinking<br>security especially you need to have a<br>very wide<br>understanding of systems and how many<br>many things relate<br>and are encapsulated by each other and<br>so having a new generation of workers<br>who are<br>really well versed in that deep<br>engineering principle is going to be<br>important<br>yeah i was i was just uh just to add<br>there<br>uh i had a really good uh analogy given<br>to me<br>um not that long ago actually in that<br>the idea<br>of like the current computer science<br>climate i guess at the moment<br>is we have a bridge building engineer<br>and a bridge breaking engineer<br>rather than training civil engineers<br>who understand i guess the<br>the whole complexity of construction<br>is you know quite a good analogy i<br>thought<br>um and it's that continuation of<br>uh training students and and bringing<br>you know bringing industry in<br>to events like this to uh<br>you know bring together that and and<br>sort of further that training i guess<br>and making sure there's sort of a<br>complete picture in a<br>engineering field<br>yeah i i do think that is really<br>important to have<br>a a systems approach to this<br>where people understand the uh<br>the how things can snowball and<br>consequences of a small<br>action um that yeah that that's<br>interesting um are we gonna take the<br>um so now uh we also have a few<br>questions similar to this from the q<br>a so for students who are trying to get<br>into cyber security<br>so how can they get into the field<br>for example we have attendees from high<br>school and university level and also<br>somebody in the industry<br>but interested to be in the cyber<br>security field so<br>how should they do it like should they<br>go take a<br>paper class or<br>do something so we have we have a<br>question from a participant and they're<br>asking<br>um do you do you need a general do you<br>start with a general cs degree or or<br>you go into and go and get<br>certifications and you start from there<br>what's the way to get in like<br>i think the industry is moving in such a<br>fast rate that<br>uh students are learning about cyber<br>security even in high school<br>and i mean even before they reach<br>tertiary level they can<br>do things like attend uh<br>conferences and join user groups their<br>local security user group<br>and uh you know even events like this<br>are great for<br>raising the level of knowledge and<br>i guess making connections within the<br>industry<br>one thing one thing i would say is um<br>and we see this a lot with our<br>internship program is like<br>the the qualifications that we're seeing<br>like so there's<br>now there are actually cyber security<br>qualifications um<br>and they do help people kind of bring up<br>a base<br>level of of knowledge which is really<br>good but i'd say the thing that<br>makes people stand out to us is those<br>who have kind of gone beyond what<br>they've learned at university um and<br>they've actually<br>you know investigated it and spent some<br>time um in their own time to go and<br>research a particular area or understand<br>a bit more about um you know a<br>particular<br>field of security it's the same same<br>thing with um if you<br>get into development like if you're<br>sitting down for a job interview and<br>you know you've kind of you've done um<br>you know you've got a<br>software engineering degree and all but<br>all you can talk about is your<br>the things that you learn in your course<br>um<br>you're not going to stand out in<br>comparison to the person who has you<br>know invested a lot of time<br>um in building doing some open soft open<br>source software or something like that<br>and has<br>actually built something and got<br>something to to show for it um yeah i<br>don't think uh<br>i'd say the thing the thing that that<br>differentiates people<br>mostly when i'm talking to them is<br>passion<br>and if somebody has his real passion for<br>the industry which to be honest<br>is like there's a lot you need to learn<br>there's a heap to stay on top of it's<br>constantly evolving and<br>if you don't have the passion that i i<br>imagine will be<br>quite a draining industry to be a part<br>of i'm kind of you know not<br>trying to be too negative about that but<br>like that passion is is really what what<br>drives people to be continually learning<br>and continually staying on top of things<br>enough and you know<br>and and that passion when we're talking<br>to people was always demonstrated by<br>what they've done outside of their<br>courses um<br>more so than you know how you have a<br>straight a plus<br>um you know degree which is great i'm<br>not trying to i'm trying to say that's<br>not<br>really really awesome and that is i<br>guess a differentiator but yeah it's um<br>yeah the passion really has to be there<br>yeah when you have two people with the<br>same grade and how do you<br>choose yeah exactly exactly yeah it's um<br>yeah<br>it's a really interesting industry to be<br>in and i'd say universities have gone<br>you know since since i've been a while<br>since i've left university<br>many years ago that was the now there<br>are actually<br>qualifications and proper courses that<br>are teaching you know things that are<br>actually relevant for<br>the industry but it's not they can't<br>stop there yeah<br>so um i guess this is a question for<br>everybody but<br>uh particularly to david um<br>so we have a question from one of our<br>attendees<br>they are a cyber security graduate and<br>um<br>uh they're asking how can uh they get an<br>internship in the cyber security field<br>yeah so we we so we have a mix of<br>programs hopefully you've heard of<br>summer of tech um<br>which is a internship program and i know<br>that we've<br>um talked to a whole lot of uh graduates<br>and<br>students who have been part of um the<br>waikato cyber security course<br>um so we we will predominantly hire our<br>interns through summer of tech<br>so you know just simply because of the<br>exposure the number of students that are<br>going through there<br>um and kind of the the programs<br>organized really well<br>um to kind of help uh you know interns<br>and<br>companies connect um but we do also um<br>we've<br>consultants i'll say um yeah kind of at<br>the very junior level um even<br>straight out of high school um people<br>who have<br>you know we've encountered because<br>they've reached out to us or<br>um you know they've been along to some<br>of the events um<br>that um have been talked about and um<br>we've met them and they've you know<br>shown that passion and<br>that's just that's been enough so um<br>yeah i'd say<br>kind of you know definitely enroll in<br>summer of tech definitely<br>you know come come talk to me go to the<br>meet and greet and things like that but<br>um yeah like i would say really it's<br>about<br>if you're looking for an internship you<br>need to be talking to people<br>yeah um and and it's the it's you know<br>it's not your cv that's that's gonna<br>help you to stand out it's actually you<br>rocking up to an event and<br>um getting some face time with the<br>people who are doing hiring so that<br>could be<br>you know conferences um unfortunately<br>we're a bit lacking in conferences this<br>year given<br>kind of the global pandemic but um you<br>know things like that<br>yeah so um so are certification<br>important or is kind of like the factor<br>um for you to choose as a person like<br>look at their qualification so it's how<br>important is<br>um certification these days and what are<br>the top certifications<br>that you can actually access that skill<br>yeah so<br>um the offensive security courses are<br>excellent um and<br>but i honestly i compare them to um<br>university qualifications you know any<br>kind of qualification that you have<br>helps to lift that base knowledge and<br>definitely gives you a step up but<br>and of themselves if you've got say um<br>oscp<br>then that's not that you know and just<br>by itself if you<br>if there's not the passion behind it if<br>you can't you know you know talk about<br>the different topics and things that<br>you've learned about and if that<br>doesn't really excite you then that's<br>going to be obvious when we're talking<br>to you so yeah definitely go get a<br>certification you'll learn heaps<br>and like if you're doing oecp or oca or<br>oh it was the latest on oswe<br>um the then they will all teach you<br>skills that will be really useful if<br>you're doing<br>um you know penetration testing or even<br>if you're going on to work as a you know<br>an engineer in an organization those<br>those skills that'll help you to test<br>the things that we will be looking for<br>will help you to build better systems<br>which will make<br>our jobs harder which is good um but<br>yeah like and of themselves<br>qualifications<br>are just qualifications yeah<br>we'll give david a breather<br>wanted to uh uh comment on that yes<br>i'd agree with what david said um<br>the qualifications it helps bring that<br>baseline up<br>for me i i will hire people if they do<br>not have a qualification no problems but<br>they need experience and have<br>done something and and again the passion<br>that david talked about<br>if they don't have experience that's<br>okay then i'll say great what<br>qualifications have you got and what i'm<br>interested in<br>isn't the qualifications themselves it's<br>the story about why you chose those ones<br>what did you learn from them how do they<br>relate to each other<br>i find that with the the cyber security<br>qualifications there's this amazing<br>matrix<br>and mix of deep specialities and all the<br>different aspects of security have you<br>gone and<br>deliberately gone and got one of each or<br>have you gone deep in one particular<br>area<br>having some structure to your<br>qualifications and certifications really<br>helps<br>yeah because um not only some security<br>covers policies covers development<br>penetration testing and softwares and<br>all that thing<br>i'd have to agree that the<br>certifications that kind of have a<br>practical component<br>are going to be most useful to<br>employers in kind of being able to show<br>that<br>a candidate can demonstrate skills and<br>knowledge in the area<br>so um and also probably some of the<br>certifications that<br>uh most certifications don't have an<br>expiry date so<br>if um and that's useful for in the sense<br>that<br>uh it forces professionals to go out and<br>do continuous learning on in their area<br>to make sure they're up to date<br>so definitely there's a kind of a wide<br>range of<br>technical and non-technical<br>certifications that someone can take<br>depending on what you're interested in<br>so<br>this here's an interesting question um<br>just looking at the q a<br>what's the best and worst part of your<br>jobs<br>the worst one i've heard about the<br>exciting part<br>i had the worst part of my head the<br>worst part is that moment where you<br>realize oh yeah<br>we've been compromised or oh they've<br>been here for three years<br>or oh they're in the backups too oh<br>they're encrypted and they've taken our<br>really sensitive data and they're<br>holding us to ransom<br>that that progression of learning the<br>worst thing and<br>eventually you get to the other side of<br>it and i guess the<br>the best part of the job is that feeling<br>of we've remediated we've fixed the<br>problem we've got rid of we<br>we think to the best of our ability the<br>intruder we can feel a bit<br>more safe now that that feeling is<br>yes oh sorry uh yeah the<br>uh i think it is well it's kind of both<br>the<br>the the best and the worst part at the<br>same time<br>is uh uh you know going down the rabbit<br>hole you find<br>something and you really really chase it<br>and you you know you spend so much time<br>on this thing uh and then finding out<br>that it wasn't what you thought it was<br>uh or you know sometimes it pays off<br>and you know you you spend that time and<br>you find something really cool<br>um i think maybe that that comes with<br>experience<br>of of sort of learning when to uh<br>not dive too deep on on a particular job<br>and a particular thing that you found um<br>but yeah that that can definitely be a<br>wild<br>yeah i i want to jump sorry quickly on<br>what sam said so we often do um<br>have that journey with our customers um<br>and<br>it is kind of the best and the worst<br>thing when<br>you know you've been working with a<br>customer for potentially a really long<br>time<br>and um you know maybe they don't have<br>they haven't met they haven't increased<br>in their security maturity over the<br>years<br>um and maybe they've had some<br>compromises and you've helped them to<br>remediate<br>a few things but they haven't really had<br>that leap that they need to have in<br>order to<br>actually become resilient um but when<br>they do<br>that is a you know you've kind of you've<br>been on this journey with a customer<br>for you know it might have been five<br>years and suddenly you go<br>down and you have a meeting with them<br>and there's this new energy<br>you you know maybe you're doing an<br>internal network test or something like<br>that and<br>you know while you've basically been<br>able to copy paste your report from the<br>last you know four years this year it's<br>different<br>i've remediated everything and you're<br>like oh wow this is exciting this is<br>something um<br>you know you know new and challenging<br>and i'm actually going to have to you<br>know<br>stretch myself in order to find things<br>here but that kind of helping<br>customers move through that you know<br>security and the<br>growing their security maturity is is<br>kind of yeah i would say one of the best<br>things but also<br>one of the more um worst things as well<br>when they haven't<br>had um they haven't done that yeah<br>yeah so we have an interesting question<br>here have you<br>come across a threat that a situation<br>where you have a threat we have an<br>attack evolving in front of you and<br>as you are trying to contain it it just<br>runs away or moved around<br>and tried infecting other things<br>it would be nice to hear of your<br>experiences if you have had any like<br>that<br>is that is that a directed question um<br>open to anyone who oh i'll let somebody<br>else pick that one up then yeah mean<br>uh as i mean if you have come across<br>something like that and if you can<br>describe it<br>in in a generic way that would be fine<br>um okay uh well uh we'll we'll move past<br>that<br>um so here's a question uh um<br>about students in high school what<br>what can they do in high school to learn<br>more about cyber security<br>like is there any tools that you can<br>start playing with<br>yeah yeah so i i've actually we've got a<br>like a little bit of a list and the best<br>part<br>is that these tools are free so you know<br>you don't need to go<br>don't need to go and pay for them um so<br>some of you have maybe done a little bit<br>of of playing around with stuff<br>might have might have heard of uh burp<br>suite<br>so port swigger the company that make<br>that tool<br>have a like a free web security academy<br>you can go and<br>um you know poke around at some web apps<br>uh there's always<br>um hack the box so that you download a<br>vm image<br>that's vulnerable to something in<br>particular and you've gotta you know try<br>and capture the flag effectively<br>uh there's also pintista lab<br>there's also a really good one as well<br>they're constantly updating<br>uh and i've actually found that useful<br>in my day-to-day<br>where they're updating that with<br>new and relevant kind of attacks and<br>information there<br>um yeah in terms of online tooling and<br>sort of<br>free stuff that you can go and do right<br>now there<br>is a ton of resources there that weren't<br>there<br>when i was going through university so<br>so a related question um<br>so when you have a write-up for an<br>exploit or ctf then at some point of<br>time we will have a write-up for ours as<br>well<br>um how do you what's the best way to<br>learn from them so do you do you<br>recreate<br>that um what you what you see in the<br>write-up um<br>what would be the best way to go about<br>it<br>yeah i mean uh i think it comes back to<br>that<br>you know building and breaking saying<br>that uh<br>you know a good writer will maybe come<br>with a proof of concept<br>um but the idea is to take that<br>information and actually build it<br>yourself<br>in either a lab or a virtual machine<br>and uh attempting to recreate that that<br>research there<br>um i think there was something recently<br>with uh f5<br>vpns i think going around on twitter<br>and um you know a few of the guys at<br>work brought up a uh you know<br>f5 and and uh tried to<br>work out the the proof of concept for<br>you know how to actually<br>yeah often when and this is possibly a<br>more on the job thing but often when i'm<br>reading up about<br>particular um issues or things like that<br>it's<br>because they're relevant to the the<br>engagement that i'm doing at the time<br>and so<br>kind of the there are varying degrees of<br>information they might have a proof of<br>concept that kind of thing but actually<br>standing up your own test environment<br>um figuring out how to exploit it and<br>then conducting that<br>and demonstrating the impact of how you<br>need to patch your stuff this is why<br>it's really important<br>against this customer that um that's<br>really useful<br>i'd say the the piece that's really<br>useful and often missing is<br>understanding as well how to remediate<br>those issues<br>um you know kind of a it may just be<br>patching but often<br>um and like with the i think with the f5<br>issue that was<br>um released recently they um they<br>published a patch for it but it wasn't<br>effective<br>and so yeah so patching in itself wasn't<br>wasn't enough to<br>to help you you couldn't just go and<br>patch your software you needed to<br>understand what<br>the mitigating um uh controls that you<br>could implement whether you<br>remove that um you know vulnerable<br>interface from the internet for a period<br>of time or whether there are you know<br>configuration elements you can go and<br>change but<br>actually when you're picking up a um<br>kind of a walk through or write up of<br>issues or things like that not just<br>understanding about how to exploit it<br>but also<br>how um how it can be remediated as will<br>will help you<br>a whole lot right<br>so um so we have a new question um<br>so how much of your job is uh creating<br>depends how it depends how big the the<br>job is so sometimes the report i mean<br>yeah uh darshan you can probably<br>elaborate on this as well but it'll be<br>yeah uh uh maybe uh four fifths of a<br>week will be spent testing and maybe a<br>week<br>a day sorry a day of report writing and<br>the tooling kind of<br>it depends on how how uh<br>good of a report writer you are actually<br>um<br>uh yeah i mean i mean being realistic<br>about it<br>at the end of the day uh the report that<br>a client receives from me has to<br>help them and oftentimes that's<br>the main point of communication between<br>between me and their technical team for<br>instance<br>so um while it's really great i might<br>have come up with this like sweet python<br>script<br>that does something very elaborate if i<br>can't<br>the test itself or the exploit itself<br>kind of<br>loses that that uh meaning or you know<br>if<br>you were talking about remediation<br>before uh<br>if i can't explain something that i've<br>done to a technical team to help<br>them remediate the problem then<br>it's not particularly useful um<br>so yeah i would say that's a fairly good<br>you know<br>three three days out of five i'm doing<br>actual hacking<br>the other two reporting uh<br>is is probably about the balance so<br>about our reports as the golden sheets<br>of paper it's kind of like<br>that's the only deliverable really that<br>a customer is getting from<br>from our testing and so it needs to be<br>you know kind of worth the money that<br>they pay for it<br>um so yeah we do invest um as insomnia<br>will as well<br>um a lot of time into making sure that<br>our reports are<br>you know meeting the customers needs and<br>expectations<br>and as someone who gets those reports it<br>certainly makes a big deal to me<br>yeah uh how well they communicated<br>you're absolutely right to talk about<br>the if you can find this most amazing<br>exploit and this vulnerability that you<br>can do all sorts of bad stuff with<br>if you can't explain it to the customer<br>then actually it's all for naught<br>yeah hopefully they know what's going on<br>but sometimes<br>sometimes they won't and so what i look<br>for is reports that are really clear<br>about<br>the consequences of inaction you know if<br>we leave this<br>as it is what could go wrong and some<br>options you know we could remediate it<br>by<br>taking those interfaces off the internet<br>or just turning it off completely or<br>patching it or<br>or if we get options and we can consider<br>what the consequences might be<br>that helps us make good decisions<br>without having to have<br>highly trained specialized staff to<br>spend all the time finding those<br>often times oh sorry it's just that<br>the reports actually help soothe um for<br>future and for prevention<br>method and see what you can do about it<br>yeah<br>interesting yeah i was going to say<br>often adding adding to sam that<br>oftentimes<br>um you know our reports go straight to a<br>technical team and and uh you know<br>divided between<br>uh people to try and implement those<br>remediations and they may not have the<br>whole<br>context of the application or the system<br>or the network that they're trying to<br>fix<br>so it's important that it is explained<br>in each of those you know particular<br>vulnerabilities of finding<br>that uh the impact on the whole system<br>rather than just<br>the single piece as well is important<br>in my opinion anyway um<br>we have a a broad hot potato question<br>on the q a and let's see if somebody<br>wants to lay their hands on it<br>uh wha what are you what are you um what<br>are your thoughts about the<br>state-sponsored<br>so i think uh more than once one would<br>be question would be how do you think<br>it's evolving<br>yeah from beginning of stuxnet and other<br>nuclear yeah all the plants energy<br>and plant attacks<br>so two thoughts one is we<br>as an industry care a lot more about<br>integrity<br>than we used to we we really used to<br>focus on<br>it's all about confidentiality don't let<br>the bad people take your secrets<br>and now we've realized it's not just<br>them damaging us through ransomware it's<br>it's<br>damaging a nuclear plant or<br>a blast furnace or some other physical<br>asset<br>can be destroyed and have real economic<br>consequences and so<br>i'm seeing that kind of movement between<br>nations you know<br>getting real-world effects out of<br>cyber activity<br>what i'd like on the on the civil<br>society side as we're now having more of<br>a conversation about<br>what are the norms for state actors<br>online you know what what is generally<br>considered acceptable and reasonable<br>versus what is beyond the pale what is<br>inappropriate and<br>civil society says we don't want this<br>and i don't think we've landed that<br>conversation<br>yet it's it's happening it's happening<br>more and more but it's still happening<br>the um in terms of governments and<br>industry we're seeing a lot of more uh<br>collaboration in terms of uh protection<br>of critical infrastructure<br>so i think that's important for us to<br>i guess focus on what's what's important<br>and what needs to be defended the most<br>and i guess where the dollars need and<br>if it needs to be spent<br>on the other side i guess um we've got<br>uh<br>the as i mentioned the<br>the concept of what are the limits of<br>what a government is allowed to do in<br>terms of<br>is it permissible for them to hack back<br>uh a an attacker to try and<br>uh learn more about uh<br>who or do the attribution of who the<br>actual attackers are<br>so and i think that's a continuing<br>whether things like uh hacking back and<br>attacker<br>is actually permissible or<br>um so lee when when um when i was<br>um when we were having conversations<br>with rsa earlier<br>uh um<br>your team mentioned that they they're<br>working on uh some thread detection<br>uh tools that uh that you're developing<br>can you talk about that a little bit<br>yeah absolutely so essentially uh<br>regardless of<br>who the actual attackers are if you when<br>you're protecting<br>um you've got to have say threat<br>protection response tools<br>in order to be able to have visibility<br>of what's going on in your network<br>so apart from obviously being able to<br>collect all the telemetry within a<br>customer's<br>network to say triage alerts<br>uh we are moving further and further<br>into<br>the threat intelligence platforms so<br>being able to get threat feeds from<br>governments and other<br>industry organizations that say such as<br>shadow server<br>that um to actually track threat actors<br>and i guess being able to bring that<br>into say your traditional<br>stacem or um your packets<br>kind of infrastructure to be able to<br>enrich what you're seeing<br>in your own network so definitely uh<br>we're seeing a lot more automation<br>in in the response tools and also<br>the threat intelligence platforms<br>increasing<br>and will make makes the<br>um allows you to make greater sense of<br>what you're actually seeing<br>in terms of traffic in your logs have<br>you given it a fancy name yet<br>yeah well we uh we've got uh our saw<br>platform<br>we've got the net witness orchestrator<br>uh which is a combination of a threat<br>intelligence platform and<br>uh orchestrations uh store platform<br>to do automation of basically<br>actions when when you have particular<br>events<br>so there's a lot of activity relating to<br>that in that space<br>okay um that's interesting uh so we have<br>we have we have a good question<br>and i think that's a really nice<br>question to wrap this up with<br>um so question from sam redmond<br>once a report is written and the<br>customer receives it<br>um have you ever been asked to come back<br>in and execute one of the solutions<br>um if their i.t department is<br>incompetent<br>say that oh they can't use it they try<br>it but it doesn't work<br>ah i mean<br>i don't really get to assess whether<br>someone's i.t department is in<br>confidence or not<br>uh do do we get call call back yeah<br>absolutely um i mean it's not<br>necessarily like as a job of a pen<br>tester it's not necessarily<br>uh my role to come back in and<br>and necessarily fix a network um<br>but i should be able to provide enough<br>information to their technical team in<br>order to go and<br>perform those remediations um<br>we do help out where we can obviously um<br>you know there's there's questions that<br>come back all the time and we always<br>work<br>really closely with our clients so um<br>but in in terms of do i go in and start<br>writing code for<br>you know a particular app or something<br>not usually no<br>i don't think anyone wants to see my<br>programming so<br>it's like there's not a steep learning<br>curve when it comes to familiarizing<br>yourself with the code base<br>um yeah yeah yeah like the people who<br>are actually in the best position to be<br>able to fix issues<br>are the people who are familiar with it<br>it would be you know while<br>um you know as technical people we may<br>have those skills<br>we certainly there's kind of a<br>distinction between<br>our responsibilities there so certainly<br>we'd go in and and<br>help explain things to people we might<br>even sit down with you know developers<br>um and particularly when we're doing<br>sort of on-site engagements where we're<br>actually working really closely with<br>people<br>we might sit down and go okay this is<br>definitely where the<br>you know we're seeing the issue and this<br>is um some of the ideas that you need to<br>explore in order to remediate that but<br>it's certainly not our<br>position to make kind of even sam level<br>decisions<br>for um you know the organizations and<br>stuff like that it always should be the<br>um bonus on on the onus of the customer<br>to go and fix things particularly<br>because<br>um things are going to crop up and you<br>know we<br>we don't want to become a crutch to an<br>organization for fixing things<br>ultimately we want to be helping them to<br>upskill and improve so that they can go<br>and you know do those things themselves<br>um yeah it would be um a bad time as<br>well if you ever got a court calling a<br>uh i.t team um incompetent that would<br>and i think in addition just quickly in<br>addition to that<br>uh you know we're supposed to as a pen<br>test they come in with<br>a sort of level of integrity and um<br>i guess if we were like hey buy buy this<br>product and it will fix all your<br>security problems that you know then<br>then<br>that could be you know seen rather<br>poorly in the in the industry<br>well it removes our independence from it<br>as well it's kind of yeah if we were the<br>ones who<br>actually sat down and helped you've<br>helped you fix your code and went and<br>did that then it wouldn't be appropriate<br>for us to go and<br>test that again as well we'd need to you<br>know we need to have arrangements with<br>between insomnia and auri that if i fix<br>something then goes<br>yeah oh so it goes and tested it again<br>yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>right um so um so we have a question<br>about<br>you know why you chose cyber security as<br>your career but i think you<br>that that has been answered in various<br>forms<br>when you talk about um<br>uh and we do have a number of other<br>questions as well and i'm not sure why<br>they're all coming up<br>uh with with uh abigail's name oh i<br>think it's from the students i sent a<br>link to<br>we will have to we'll have to finish<br>because we<br>are a few minutes over time already um<br>i would like to uh thank the panelists<br>who have taken time off<br>on a saturday or a weekend to to be here<br>i would like to thank all our sponsors<br>uh for making uh this possible<br>i'd like to thank the audience who have<br>been here and have asked you nice<br>questions<br>uh very pertinent questions uh and uh<br>a big thank you to all the participants<br>uh in the new zealand cyber security<br>challenge<br>uh and i will also wish good luck to<br>those uh 10 who are going in<br>uh to our purple team challenge uh
