cooter<br>welcome everybody to this webinar for<br>the School of Arts or orientation for<br>2020 for trimester be fine animals<br>Gareth shots and the head of school for<br>took a toy which is the School of Arts<br>and I'm going to talk to you very<br>broadly today about the BA and the BA<br>degree structure as well as some of the<br>specializations within the VA which are<br>majors which are ran by programs within<br>the School of Arts so if you're here<br>because you're doing a BA then you're in<br>the right place and if you're here<br>because you're doing a major within the<br>VA with the School of Arts you're also<br>in the right place so I'm going to begin<br>by showing those through an introductory<br>video to the school<br>right so as I send it my third brief<br>introduction for those who have just<br>joined us well that video is playing my<br>name is associate professor Karen<br>Scott's out of the screen and Media<br>Studies program but I'm also the head of<br>school for territory which is B School<br>of Arts the School of Arts has a number<br>of programs that teach them through a<br>number of different degrees I'll talk a<br>little bit about that as well today but<br>mostly I'm going to concentrate on the<br>BA<br>so these on the slides you can see the<br>programs that make up the School of Arts<br>we have international languages and<br>cultures which is comprised of different<br>streams in Chinese Japanese Spanish and<br>French we have theater studies and dance<br>that work very closely together English<br>and writing studies and screening media<br>as well as music and linguistics and<br>applied linguistics so we're quite a<br>broad school and we teach across a<br>number of different degrees so if you're<br>doing a BA and specialism is based in<br>the school of social science or you can<br>score a psychology today's presentation<br>should give you some information about<br>sort of the complementary programs that<br>you might want to take papers in to<br>complement the studies elsewhere so the<br>way in which I approach these<br>orientation presentations is I make the<br>assumption that you are coming here and<br>you know what you're coming here to<br>study and so this is a sort of more of a<br>broader picture about some of the other<br>options that you might have available to<br>you so a little bit about the School of<br>Arts given that we primarily teach into<br>the BA we're very committed to the<br>Graduate attributes that come with a BA<br>and B a is a one of the oldest degrees<br>in the world one of the most recognized<br>degrees in the world<br>and one of its strongest qualities is<br>the transferability of the skills<br>regardless of the specialization take<br>within the BA so you will learn certain<br>mountain skills that you can take on<br>into the workplace and they were like<br>transferable from situation to situation<br>primarily we are interested in building<br>problem-solving and critical thinking<br>skills for all our graduates regardless<br>of their subject matter and we really<br>focus very heavily on the power of<br>communication the power of language so<br>language is that is the spine of the<br>school in many ways the language of<br>music the language of film the language<br>of movement the language of performance<br>and obviously obviously spoken and<br>written language as well we are we are<br>really very active and highly regarded<br>research school like many other schools<br>in the university and have had many of<br>our subjects appear in the top 250 in<br>world rankings for its research outputs<br>and its researchers as well as its<br>practitioners so even though this is an<br>orientation for the School of Arts and<br>the programs within it many of the<br>programs contribute to degrees which<br>span across a number of schools and I<br>think that's probably one of the<br>confusing aspects for students who are<br>first come in here they have a major<br>which is based within school but maybe<br>that major is based within a degree<br>which spreads across a number of schools<br>and so that is the case for The Bachelor<br>of the Arts Bachelor of Arts it can be<br>taken within the school the Faculty of<br>Law the School of Psychology and the<br>school of social science within the<br>division of us psychology social science<br>and long within our school we also offer<br>a Bachelor of Music which is obviously<br>connected very closely with our music<br>program and separate from The Bachelor<br>of Arts you can take music as part of<br>The Bachelor of Arts we also contribute<br>to The Bachelor design which is mainly<br>housed within computer science and<br>graphic design but we contribute and<br>form the screen and media to a major<br>called media design and we also<br>contribute to The Bachelor of Social<br>Sciences so if you're taking a Bachelor<br>of Social Sciences you can also take a<br>major in linguistics or in screen media<br>and if you're taking another major you<br>can take major papers from those majors<br>to complement whatever your specialism<br>so when you come here you are taught by<br>a number of different people but many of<br>which renowned and recognized for the<br>work that they do in the particular<br>areas that they work in we are quite<br>broad in the sense that our staff aren't<br>just typical researchers in the way in<br>which they work in the sense that they<br>don't necessarily do quantitative<br>research and just write journal articles<br>and book chapters or even books and<br>monographs we do a range of things in<br>the School of Arts so many of our<br>academics and our scholars will also be<br>leading practitioners in their fields<br>some musicians theatre performance dance<br>performance and so on filmmakers many<br>are Award winners and recognized for<br>their work outside of scholarly context<br>as well as inside scholarly context so<br>many our research grant recipients many<br>authors many are community leaders so<br>you will be taught not by teachers<br>within a field but people with actual<br>experience direct experience who<br>influence and also adapt and develop<br>those fields as well so one of the<br>things that I like to talk about this<br>with respect to the arts is that<br>sometimes the be a command or a little<br>bit of criticism because it has been<br>around for a long time and sometimes<br>people question the generic nature of it<br>one of the things that I always respond<br>to around that is if you look at the<br>nature of work at the moment 80 percent<br>of all jobs and all sort of careers<br>require art skills so we are preparing<br>people for the job market directly and<br>through providing them skills there<br>isn't a great deal of statistics around<br>the US and that's one of the most poorly<br>researched areas in terms of graduates<br>sort of employment but nevertheless were<br>really confident from the surveys and<br>the statistics that are available that<br>the ass action contributes quite<br>significantly to New Zealand economy and<br>provides considerable number of jobs<br>directly in the ants as well as those<br>that I've just talked about that require<br>arts-based skills in order to conduct<br>those positions successfully given that<br>we are also providing the world with<br>critical thinkers I think it's also<br>important that we think about the<br>implications of some of the sort of<br>advancements and the advancements in<br>technology the changes in our social<br>world our social communication and so<br>what we're really producing in<br>problem-solvers people who can think<br>about the ethical and moral implications<br>of the things that we can do there are<br>not many boundaries to Salou things that<br>we can do with science technologies but<br>it takes an answer to think through some<br>of whether we should be doing these<br>things or not and their implications for<br>society and culture so those are the<br>kind of key skills that we want to<br>infuse in our graduates who then<br>contribute to the corporate environment<br>or the tech environment or the tech<br>corporations in sort of dominant and<br>influential in our society culture today<br>and so also a key part of the answer is<br>that it's an integral part of everyday<br>life for most human beings and so we<br>don't separate everyday life from study<br>and research and we recognize the<br>importance of the Arts or well-being and<br>creativity for well-being and that is<br>the business that we're in in this<br>school we're interested in the impact on<br>society in culture but we're also<br>interested in contributing to that<br>culture as practitioners and as<br>filmmakers and just creatives as well so<br>let's get to the nuts and bolts of the<br>degree and just go I want to talk to you<br>about the structure of our degree we<br>have a quite a distinct structure here<br>in Waikato that's been designed<br>specifically to tailored to the waikato<br>attitude of Waikato students to offer<br>something by distinctive from other<br>universities and this has been a project<br>that we've been working on here at the<br>university over the last four five years<br>and this is the result of that work that<br>hard work so we have a universal degree<br>architecture or a structure that we all<br>follow regardless<br>what faculty or division or school we<br>belong to and that is made up of these<br>yellow sections black sections and red<br>sections as I said earlier in my talk<br>many of you probably you know what<br>you're coming here to do in the yellow<br>section for the gold section because<br>you're coming here to specialize in<br>particular area but there are other<br>areas that you'll have a huge amount of<br>choice in that it pays to actually be<br>aware of what those choices are and to<br>make complimentary choices with the<br>subject that you're here ultimately to<br>study so I want to walk you through<br>those different sections on the degree I<br>just go back to let's go back to that<br>and particularly the black areas and the<br>radio isn't is start to encourage you to<br>think about what the language you might<br>want to take if you're not doing one of<br>the majors that I've highlighted today<br>or even if you are to think about taking<br>papers from those other majors that<br>you're not here to study<br>so obviously the gold or the yellow<br>sections are the majors and the majors<br>comprised of two papers in first years<br>three and three in the second year and<br>sort of three to four in the third year<br>so those will be defined for you either<br>prescribed by the nature itself or<br>there'll be a certain amount of choice<br>within that and you can see but there's<br>the gain of the programs which are<br>contained within the School of Arts so<br>those are the programs that we run and<br>we run majors in those areas within the<br>school as well as other areas such as<br>psychology history philosophy in other<br>schools that you can also take as part<br>of the BA so there's a very strong<br>relationship between psychology and<br>English psychology and screening Media<br>Studies in the BA as well as history in<br>English within the VA as well and<br>philosophy and English screamingly<br>Media Studies with it as you might<br>expect but even though you can study<br>those areas and be socks I within the<br>black areas you have the compulsory<br>components of degrees and so not majors<br>but degrees so if you're doing MBA<br>you'll have a certain amount of choice<br>within this day a list B and this C and<br>I'll take you through<br>each of this term and what I'll do from<br>my perspective is highlight papers that<br>we offer in those areas of the degree<br>that you can have it that you have a<br>little choice in so in this list a is<br>the Disciplinary foundation so that<br>would be the first paper that you'll<br>have to make a choice about and then the<br>number of papers available to you across<br>the beasts oxide and the be a school of<br>social science and the School of Arts<br>within the VA but we will and highlight<br>our paper in a moment and then you've<br>got if you're doing a single major you<br>have a number of choices in terms of<br>electives which I think it's really<br>important for you to think about so what<br>I would like to say in the context of<br>this presentation is that you can always<br>approach program conveners if you're<br>looking on the website so each program<br>has someone that leads that program and<br>you can approach them if you're<br>interested in taking particular papers<br>as electives or you can approach me as<br>have a school and also for advice around<br>particular papers to complement what<br>you're studying in other areas of the<br>university so in terms of thinking about<br>electives obviously it's really good to<br>think about obviously compatibility with<br>what you're already doing as part of<br>your major and extending your major but<br>also to consider for example that you're<br>doing a comprehensive degree so if your<br>major is very specialized in particular<br>area it might be worth thinking about<br>broader social and cultural papers that<br>would give you that breadth of study<br>that you might sort of complement the<br>the debts that you get with your major<br>or if you're within a particular major<br>that has relationships or clear<br>relationships with other majors to sort<br>of think about complimenting your paper<br>with something in a different major so<br>for example I've got English telling<br>stories which is a Thursday of paper I<br>would then sort of look at sort of film<br>production one telling stories within<br>screen and media a different medium but<br>nevertheless very relatable to the work<br>that will be done in telling stories<br>around structure and narrative so it's<br>good to think beyond your program beyond<br>what you already know what<br>you are inspired to do it interested in<br>and have a good look at a catalogue of<br>papers and what's available and<br>apprentice within the school to ask<br>about their appropriate nature of those<br>papers and how they'll help you study<br>I'd also think about in terms of what we<br>offer in the school of asks think about<br>international connectedness so we offer<br>the opportunity for you to actually pick<br>up a language within the school a number<br>of people will take Japanese or Chinese<br>knowing that it has value in the<br>economic world but sort of their growing<br>and sort of cultural relevance of those<br>cultures and more understanding in the<br>West as to the production of films and<br>theatre and performative arts so I<br>understand in different cultural outputs<br>as well we already know about the<br>popularity of anime and manga and<br>theories of the aspects of Japanese<br>culture and that's spreading much more<br>widely now so thinking about<br>international connectedness thinking<br>about intercultural communication and<br>thinking about a workplace in the future<br>which is more likely to be global and<br>connected more strongly and thinking<br>about cultural fluency - in terms of you<br>know your ability to understand<br>different attitudes beliefs of culture<br>cultural traditions so taking you<br>through the Disciplinary the compulsory<br>elements the first one is the<br>Disciplinary foundations the purpose of<br>this paper is to really provide you with<br>skills that you require for university<br>studies of course skills not that<br>different from school but there are<br>slight nuances and slight differences<br>that actually you gently tune in to<br>those and you continue performing in the<br>way that you did at school<br>you won't make that transition<br>successfully as those who really take<br>onboard some of those differences so key<br>differences will be the independence of<br>study managing your workload and also<br>the structure of much more broader<br>larger pieces of work in forms of essays<br>and as those writings are longer form<br>documents so we need in the context of<br>arles day we present those skills<br>through a paper called language in<br>context and again we're looking at the<br>languages the cultural specifics<br>specificity of languages the<br>appropriateness and the context for the<br>different language uses as well which is<br>quite important given that we socialize<br>when we communicate across many<br>different networks so we would<br>communicate quite differently online<br>compared to how we might communicate<br>face-to-face so this is about language<br>in all those different contexts in<br>professional environments formal<br>environments entertainment environments<br>and again I think language is really at<br>the heart of what we do in this school<br>so it's a part of the strong part music<br>departments try part of the English<br>department strong part of the screen and<br>media department even though we we deal<br>with screens we still talk about the<br>grammar of filmmaking and structure of<br>filmmaking and how you put together a<br>sequence in order to convey a message or<br>a feeling effectively so these are all<br>about communication skills and alongside<br>that you will get those literacies that<br>are required throughout the degree so<br>well many students don't really like the<br>compulsion of having to take certain<br>papers nevertheless they're designed to<br>really help you throughout your degree<br>and then quite important so we would<br>recommend within the School of Arts that<br>you consider language in contexts that<br>are quite important and broad and paper<br>but that will help you in a number of<br>different situations and circumstances<br>with communication and appropriate<br>communication this B really deals with<br>cultural perspectives again it adds to<br>the breadth of your degree when they<br>might blow so you'll come away with a<br>broad understanding of a particular sort<br>of you know sort within cultural<br>perspectives and a broader cultural<br>perspectives on things because as we<br>know much of academia can actually take<br>place in the West and we think develop<br>very sort of narrow ways of thinking and<br>here in New Zealand we're open to a<br>broader way of thinking as a bilingual<br>and bicultural country so this is an<br>acknowledgement of that and an<br>incorporation of that into your degree<br>and again the rationale for that being<br>kind of<br>so increased exposure to cultures we<br>live in a sort of their campus itself is<br>a multicultural environment we engage<br>with many different cultures and<br>humility so as part of your working life<br>as well so in that context we offer a<br>number of specifically different design<br>papers but we also offer papers within<br>majors that actually have that cultural<br>broader cultural sort of remit within<br>the study of English and within the<br>study of linguistics so you can see in<br>the Intel codes are from international<br>languages cultures and that actually<br>should read international languages and<br>cultures I think of the year the the<br>square has cropped up the cultures there<br>and that can be taken as part of your<br>first year if you have the scope to take<br>it in your first year but you can also<br>change it in your center you can take a<br>paper in your second year you can take<br>understand in East Asia which again is a<br>really valuable and important for<br>intercultural communication and cultural<br>fluency<br>then we have in English we have global<br>fictions which looks at literature<br>across the globe and in linguistics we<br>have a further paper called language<br>society cultures which is very much<br>there as a paper that we have a media<br>called media society and culture but<br>again looking at these topics in a very<br>broad way across the world across across<br>the globe how certain cultures are<br>impacting and certain cultural<br>engagements and coming together in<br>conscious and change the course of their<br>cultural change a nature of cultures so<br>these are really kind of important<br>holistic papers to engage with and then<br>another sort of defining feature of our<br>degrees in Waikato is that all of our<br>students will have a word placement or<br>what we call a word integrated learning<br>experience and we're very well-placed to<br>do this in the arts we have a number of<br>work integrated learning papers in which<br>students can actually apply their<br>skillset in a number of different work<br>contexts or professional contexts there<br>are three specifically designed papers<br>or<br>integrated learning in the third year<br>that are run by the School of Arts<br>called professional practice in the arts<br>work-related project in the arts and<br>arts and cultural festivals so with<br>respect the first one professional<br>practice in the arts that is a more<br>traditional placement work integrated<br>learning paper where you can actually go<br>and have a work placement with a company<br>or an organization but we recognize that<br>work is not necessarily about working in<br>a building from organization but a lot<br>of people who come out of the arts<br>usually work independently work as<br>freelance contractors so there is also<br>an option within those papers to work<br>for an external client to complete a<br>task design a website makers or<br>audio-visual promotional materials<br>scrimped something or write promotional<br>materials but not necessarily go and<br>work in that organization be brief by<br>that organization work here using our<br>resources our facilities so it's an<br>opportunity for students to work<br>independently to someone else's brief to<br>a client's brief and that work and may<br>be used by that organization or not that<br>you get valuable experience in terms of<br>working to external clients brief then<br>we have work related projects in the<br>arts and that's more about a more<br>independent research project where you<br>can look at the nature of practices in<br>the arts and you can do some sort of<br>independent research around that and if<br>you want to some practice based research<br>so there being various projects done so<br>far on this will paper where someone has<br>a student of mine for example has looked<br>at the different forms of journalism on<br>different media platforms and taken the<br>same research our research story but<br>presented it for different audiences for<br>different publications or we can look at<br>practices within the arts and processes<br>connected to filmmaking and process is<br>connected to creative writing or other<br>areas of the Arts and think about<br>changes that can be made to those<br>processes and how that might change or<br>improve those processes so that's more<br>the research-based<br>paper which is research within a<br>professional environment and then<br>finally we've got the arts and cultural<br>festivals work integrated learning paper<br>so if you're already a practitioner<br>practitioner or a creative practitioner<br>in the arts and you contribute to<br>festivals such as the Hamilton gardens<br>Arts Festival or the fringe fest<br>and the festivals that are run in the<br>Waikato there are many many in Hamilton<br>you can use some of that experience and<br>reflect on that professional experience<br>in the form of this paper so we'll<br>usually ask you to do writing a work log<br>around the performance the work log<br>around the professional practice and<br>then a reflection piece on that practice<br>so those are our three work integrated<br>learning papers so this is just<br>reinforcing what I've said that you can<br>actually work off-site with an external<br>client but you can also work<br>independently more freelance in the way<br>in which you work and you work on campus<br>with supervision with us here utilizing<br>the resources that we have available for<br>you to use beyond that we have a number<br>of tour papers I don't go into those<br>into detail as the third year is quite a<br>long way off they're only an orientation<br>here but just to flag those now because<br>some of those have some prerequisites<br>which mean you have to take some papers<br>in advance in order to be able to<br>qualify to get into those papers so for<br>Spanish 300 I would advise you to look<br>at what other Spanish papers you might<br>have to do with ahead of your third year<br>so again it's part of your planning for<br>your degree right now a new first year<br>even though that seems quite a long way<br>off likewise we have a TV<br>professional TV studio here on campus<br>and that's we regard as a professionals<br>ecology so it's a professional space in<br>which when we teach in that space people<br>adapt and take on specific roles and<br>responsibilities connected to a TV<br>studio so in that context we have a<br>paper that allows you to work in the TV<br>studio and get your work integrated<br>learning paper but in order to do that<br>you have to do the prerequisite which is<br>highlighted on the slide there which is<br>media one or two so those<br>your payment now you can do that at any<br>point during your degree but it's good<br>to know they have to do that in advance<br>and likewise for linguistics you have to<br>do one of two set in your neighbors if<br>you wanted to do a research<br>apprenticeship with the linguistic<br>program most people who take the writing<br>studies are already based in writing<br>studies so they will probably sort of<br>get a lot more information about that<br>engine course but just again wanted to<br>complete that list of tour papers that<br>we offer in work integrated learning as<br>well<br>and that's pretty much it for me<br>that's a very quick introduction school<br>quick introduction to the BA degree<br>structure just a little bit of advice on<br>to think about some of the choices that<br>you have available to you<br>we're here to help we're here to answer<br>your questions so if you have any<br>questions now feel free to ask them and<br>we'll conclude this presentation and you<br>can ask me some questions but otherwise<br>come onto campus and come and find out<br>through your program convener is for the<br>major that you're studying or come and<br>find me as head of school and then the<br>last point is just to check out some of<br>our social media so the way to stay<br>connected with some of the activities<br>and the opportunities that are available<br>in each other programs in the School of<br>Arts is to either follow their Facebook<br>page or their Instagram page and so<br>there are pages for music screen media<br>English and small amounts on video so<br>find us and follow us if you can thank<br>just wait a second to see if anyone's<br>right so there's a question about advice<br>on a double major in philosophy and<br>psychology so those are both majors that<br>are outside the school that's fine I<br>have a PhD in psychology so I get to<br>talk about that in particular I'm not<br>quite sure in particular what you're<br>thinking about there in terms of the<br>question but obviously they are highly<br>complementary majors they work very well<br>together here within the waikato<br>and within the division the School of<br>Psychology offers a particular range of<br>areas specialisms within psychology but<br>nevertheless very much oriented towards<br>experimental and more scientific and of<br>psychology as well as even more sort of<br>the social science and psychology or the<br>community psychology and social<br>psychology so you've got that lovely<br>balance between the you know the very<br>scientific and the more sort of broader<br>social sciences they're either one of<br>those options if you were too interested<br>in follow those kind of particular<br>streams within your major in psychology<br>either of those ones would complement<br>philosophy because obviously philosophy<br>was a part of the family and all<br>psychology psychology grew out of<br>philosophy so philosophy again is<br>becoming much more social science<br>oriented thinking about society and<br>culture and key issues in society in<br>culture so many of our philosophers are<br>working in a number of contemporary<br>areas here within the division or you<br>know around a range of areas looking out<br>through you know to pro-life issues and<br>you know things of that nature to<br>happiness and well-being as well as<br>other mediated areas such as video games<br>and sort of modern culture like video<br>games so there's a very quite a breadth<br>of interest within the philosophy<br>department so it's not necessarily just<br>classical philosophy<br>philosophy applied to a very<br>contemporary context so I think there<br>should be no issues with a double major<br>in those two areas from that answers<br>questions okay so there's a question<br>about online offerings in English and<br>screen and media studies certainly the<br>situation has changed quite<br>significantly so with the advent of the<br>global pandemic we've all moved over to<br>online while the alert levels were high<br>in here in New Zealand but as they've<br>reduced a number of our programs of<br>retained online options and we continue<br>to offer a face-to-face and online so<br>even if our colleagues are now going<br>back to you face to face we will still<br>offer an online option for anybody who's<br>overseas remote or is unable to come<br>onto campus so it's not really an issue<br>for studying from overseas we're well<br>geared for that a number of the programs<br>sort of such as English who didn't offer<br>much by the way online and I'm<br>considering offering purely net papers<br>but at the moment both papers are<br>offered face to face as well as online<br>so while there's fighting an important<br>interactive component to English in<br>particular we are trying to integrate<br>those who are sitting in on those<br>lectures remotely so we're using zoom<br>we're also recording the sessions and<br>we're posting them online the same day<br>as the session from the sound so we try<br>to incorporate you into those sessions<br>because that's really important to your<br>development in those fields within<br>screen and media studies likewise the<br>segment's happen we have a broader<br>number of online papers already but our<br>first year of paper from semester AIDS<br>media 100 understand the visual culture<br>will be run as an that paper in semester<br>B so you can take that paper right away<br>but if it isn't it isn't an M paper<br>option in a paper there is the online<br>remote options still available to you so<br>I don't think there'll be any issues<br>just wait to see if anyone's typing away<br>there's a question about a particular<br>paper media 504 this semester and<br>whether that can be taken online the the<br>answer to that again is yes we were in<br>preparing the paper initially we were<br>under impression that most of the people<br>that we were teaching on that paper<br>we're going to be here on campus but<br>actually we made provision for people<br>who are offshore away from campus to be<br>able to take this paper as well so that<br>paper is updated the assignments have<br>been changed accordingly so that you can<br>take it online and there will also be<br>opportunities for you to join in buyers<br>in to participate in the class as well<br>so yes there is a online dimension to<br>that paper that you can actually take it<br>successfully so thanks for asking but<br>yeah it's good to clarify that there's<br>so if you're doing screen and media<br>studies you should go to the screen and<br>media programs so they share the same<br>name and if it's the MMC T that you're<br>studying it will be the screen and Media<br>Studies program or if it's the screen<br>media ma again it's the screen media<br>studies program and we have a graduate<br>adviser specifically to advise people<br>who are studying graduate level papers<br>and our graduate advisors name's dr.<br>Kyle Barrett's you should be able to<br>find him on the screen in media<br>program webpage and you should go to<br>contact well you'll find his contact<br>details on that web page as well so<br>he'll be able to advise you on what<br>papers you take it particularly if<br>you're starting be and what other papers<br>that you can take along side maybe media<br>504 eto 590 so you can take up to if<br>you're doing an MMC t you can take up to<br>60 points in another area so he can<br>advise you on what is what complements<br>and papers you might want to take until<br>you can take 501 which runs in semester<br>a so dr. Kyle Barrett is the person that<br>okay just unless any questions pop up I<br>think we'll conclude the session if you<br>think of any more questions in the<br>meantime oh there is a question how long<br>will the online cross louse that's<br>something that we have very little<br>control over in terms of when borders<br>will be open I'm afraid ideally we are<br>you know so we're looking to get people<br>to come back and be on campus and from<br>from overseas as soon as possible we<br>have a large number of international<br>students that are unable to attend but<br>what I will say is you know that that's<br>wild violence out of our control we will<br>continue to offer options until borders<br>are open again and what we have found so<br>far is the students that have taken our<br>online courses or participated in our<br>courses online or remotely have done<br>extremely well so far so staff have done<br>an incredible job of translating what we<br>would normally do in a face-to-face<br>context into an online context and<br>they've done an incredible job and I'm<br>very grateful and thankful to all my<br>staff in the school for the wonderful<br>work they've done in trimester eight but<br>we found generally that the results have<br>been much higher and that our engagement<br>has been much more direct throughout<br>Mike so there being some real positives<br>to the online learning situation I know<br>you've b'keen to be on campus to use the<br>facilities and to use facilities such as<br>our library but nevertheless we can do a<br>lot of what we do online and in an<br>online context so ideally we'll have you<br>here as soon as possible but we will<br>continue in that in that mode and we are<br>not currently seeing any disadvantage to<br>any students who are studying in that<br>way we have seen the opposite that<br>actually we're seeing grade point<br>averages being slightly higher actually<br>as a result of some really strong<br>curriculum design I think is there a<br>okay that's quite a specific question<br>not sure if I can answer that Nikki but<br>I'll try so I think again that was a<br>paper that was initially given<br>permission to run face to face but we<br>have made sure that all papers have an<br>online dimension to them so we've added<br>that mind dimension very recently -<br>right - no - it's not only a workshop<br>situation and we've been organized in<br>session assistants around that so that<br>the person who rents that has that<br>submission support to be able to deal<br>with people in class to deal with people<br>who are sort of their remotely as well<br>so that you won't get forgotten in a<br>chat facility so we're working on that I<br>will be able to follow up in terms of<br>the reading resource list that might be<br>just that it's carried over from the<br>previous year and it has been activated<br>so that's something I can do directly<br>after the session and I can go and talk<br>to the administrator though so that's<br>something out with my paper as well it's<br>quite common for us to take the the<br>bones of what we did in the previous<br>version if it was last year or last best<br>there to carry that over into our<br>current semester and populate our new<br>paper outlines with the material from<br>last year and update those so that might<br>just be one thing from the Moodle page<br>that just hasn't been updated in the<br>last week so it's good to have that<br>pointed out and I can follow that up for<br>again just that all good wait just to<br>see if anyone's typing and really good<br>questions by the way sir thank you every<br>time I've done this two questions have<br>come in but I think I will try and say<br>goodbye again I'm not to stop you asking<br>questions but just to avoid the<br>awkwardness of me sitting here so I'll<br>just say thank you for tuning into this<br>thank you for listening and thank you<br>for your questions as well so it's<br>really good to hear the kind of things<br>that students are wanting answers to if<br>there's anything that we haven't covered<br>sufficiently today just get in touch<br>with us use the website get in touch<br>with your program convene a program<br>administrator or come directly to be as<br>head of school let me thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
