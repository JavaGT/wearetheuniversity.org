Center is not to be<br>confused with the Student Center so your<br>onboarding your new enrollment is<br>actually a central process with the our<br>students intern so we support students<br>once they've started the enrollment in<br>our tuning so we are there for you in<br>can definitely buy a zone or email<br>during your time so getting started<br>hopefully you're all enrolled and if so<br>what do you do now so this is<br>orientation week your classes will start<br>next week so you should definitely look<br>at your timetable to know what's your<br>skin you're going to be like you can<br>actually do this through a few different<br>platforms Moodle which I'll explain a<br>bit about more later and my why cattle<br>it's the system that you used for to<br>enroll and also through the university<br>of arkansas webpage which i have it<br>explore screenshot then we can go use<br>the 2020 online timetable to break it<br>down a bit and if your class and then<br>the timetable schedule itself if your<br>class has a room number<br>I hated that means it's going to be<br>running face-to-face with an online<br>option for yourselves if your class say<br>see Moodle this means that the material<br>will be available on Moodle and there is<br>no scheduled time to view that material<br>it should be made available prior to<br>your scheduled any person our class home<br>paper outline is a really important<br>document that will give you all the<br>relevant information you need for your<br>paper and that is in Moodle and it's<br>going to cover topics that you're going<br>to look at throughout the semester any<br>readings that you need to do any<br>assessments and due dates and also here<br>staff contact details and available<br>office hours so this is something you<br>need to get into to definitely be<br>familiar with before you start taking<br>your papers next week so just make sure<br>over the weekend have a good read of<br>those paper outlines and some of you are<br>enrolled in one subject for this<br>trimester and some two or three just<br>make sure you read all the paper outline<br>yeah really<br>there are some great resources for<br>online learning for you guys we have a<br>team called student wedding and they are<br>available remotely as well as in person<br>and what I'll ask is those are the two<br>I'd like to highlight if I ask Luke to<br>share a screen we'll take you to the<br>into full-screen mode here we go<br>so I'll ask Luke as well to put that<br>link in the chat so you can copy it if<br>you'd like or if you're just in the<br>university we've paid this you can open<br>it student learning and it'll come up<br>with all the resources so you'll see if<br>he Scrolls down a bit it's yes we do I<br>start I've taken a few event types<br>talking about the timetable and getting<br>yourself prepared but they've got a lot<br>of general information which is really<br>really helpful on the left hand side<br>you'll see all the various topics if<br>Luke Scrolls down a bit further we also<br>have they're learning from China and so<br>there are some specific content for our<br>Chinese students and there is a mandarin<br>version I really highly recommend that<br>you take a look at this and your<br>preparation for your studies okay could<br>you share back to the PowerPoint thank<br>you all we're gonna talk about neat says<br>how will classes be taught so what the<br>key word for the semester is blended<br>learning I wanted to get a bit of<br>background there will be student<br>studying online but also in person so<br>it's meant to be more flexible we are<br>offering the face-to-face teaching and<br>learning as well as using technology to<br>enhance the learning experience of our<br>students so students like yourselves who<br>aren't able to attend on campus will be<br>provided with an equivalent experience<br>online lectures where traditionally the<br>lecturer would stand in front of the<br>classroom to talk students one to two<br>hours mostly uninterrupted and in most<br>cases these will be replaced with a<br>series of short videos that will prepare<br>you for a more in-depth discussion or<br>workshop tutorial and activity<br>there's face-to-face for those on campus<br>and you'll have that experience online<br>using zoom so I'm actually gonna talk<br>about more about that in the next slide<br>if you enrolled in a neat paper<br>occurrence that paper is designed to be<br>fully online with no face-to-face<br>learning<br>I'll make sure going to talk a bit more<br>about paper codes and occurrences and a<br>few more slides so for you guys<br>how will it be available for you how<br>will they teacher the guidelines will be<br>provided by a lecture on how you'll be<br>asked to participate in the paper and<br>the assessments required they may<br>indicate this and the paper outline or<br>of being the initial email<br>correspondence or notifications by a<br>Moodle so they'll have their own<br>preferred way of doing this but do<br>expect to engage in some form of<br>face-to-face discussion using zoom<br>please do check your emails that<br>includes your spam or junk photos<br>because the correspondence will be<br>coming through to you some mixtures may<br>choose to send emails directly or<br>through Moodle notifications so it's<br>really important you do keep checking<br>them throughout your studies yeah and to<br>also if somehow you find you find your<br>friends received an email and you didn't<br>so make sure you contact your lecturer<br>maybe your email address has gone to<br>junk mail yes I'll just make sure you<br>get in touch with your lecturer Brett<br>that was the words I'm about yeah we<br>can't stress how important it is if you<br>don't hear anything you really do need<br>to follow up if you've got any concerns<br>so I've been talking about Moodle some<br>of you may be familiar with this or<br>really back to break it down and your<br>personalised portal and one-stop website<br>to manage your studies at the University<br>of Waikato so it's our learning platform<br>this is where all the information for<br>your paper will be available here you<br>will find all the resource materials<br>relating<br>the papers urine rollin such as the<br>paper outline which I've described the<br>assessment information and notifications<br>for the lecturers and there is an<br>opportunity to engage with your<br>classmates through online discussions<br>this is also where you'll be submitting<br>your assessments when sign out for<br>tutorials which will be through Moodle<br>or workshops you should be able to<br>indicate that you are studying from<br>overseas if you have any questions or<br>concerns do contact your lecturer don't<br>assume that they know that because I<br>know we've talked about each lecturer<br>may have a slightly different way of how<br>they're capturing that information so<br>it's better to be safe than sorry and<br>just make sure they know and make sure<br>you contact lecturer or tutors directly<br>don't say oh I check with my friend and<br>sir it's very important you contact<br>getting in touch with the lecturers<br>directly how do you access it firstly<br>you do need to be enrolled if you're not<br>able to view anything in Moodle that may<br>be that the initial reason if otherwise<br>not you can contact us at MSC my cut off<br>the AC Dean's Eid or again talk with<br>your leisure it's available if when you<br>log on to the University of Arkansas<br>website I've got a screen shot there<br>that is under the Quick Links or there's<br>so let's take a baker book you have a<br>paper code so each paper has its own<br>unique code and hopefully you're really<br>aware of this but to recap and sure you<br>do here's a breakdown of what it means<br>in this example we've used a strategic<br>management people 100 paper so those<br>first four letters five and five meters<br>current count is the subject then the<br>numbers 101 or it could be 100 200 300<br>or 500<br>as the level of paper 20 is reference to<br>year and B as the trimester so it could<br>be a B or C there are different<br>occurrences based on the different<br>campuses so Hamilton totally or needs<br>need is the online systems learning your<br>Union logon as a student you have access<br>to University of Arkansas student email<br>account this is your username at<br>students don't work until the AC tour<br>ends eat but put that up in the chat for<br>you your username and password would<br>have been sent to you during your<br>initial enrollment process but don't<br>worry you can definitely keep using your<br>personal email account as your main<br>contact please do ensure that this is<br>provided in your contact details and my<br>wife at all and make sure for a Chinese<br>student because University username or<br>login is we use Gmail and I don't think<br>you have exit gmail access in China so<br>you should keep your q or whatever the<br>email address you used back in China<br>yeah the other link that Lucas just put<br>up and could you actually look also put<br>it in the the username at students don't<br>like a today cos it's like an have that<br>format but that link is put up as a IT<br>staff health guides so you can actually<br>have a read through if you've got any<br>questions about your account that is a<br>good first place to go and then that's<br>where MSE can help you as well making<br>sure you contact in the right people or<br>give you support remotely about any IT<br>issues<br>so hopefully you are enrolled but if you<br>do wish to change what papers you're in<br>we have a deadline it is the second<br>Friday of each trimester for you to<br>change your papers<br>so for this B trimester it will be<br>Friday the 24th of July 5:00 p.m. 5:00<br>p.m. I think we could I don't know if<br>it's fixable given the time difference<br>should be yeah but make sure if you are<br>planning to change papers make sure to<br>keep the deadlines yeah<br>soon easier the instructions on there so<br>my work it's always your place to do it<br>there is a tab qualifications and papers<br>go in there and select change of<br>enrollment there you'll be able to add<br>or remove papers it's really important<br>that you do let us know if your contact<br>details have changed so hopefully when<br>you do have the chance to come to New<br>Zealand your hands perhaps a new phone<br>number or location please let us know<br>that information so we can contact you<br>if necessary my walkathon is a place<br>that you can do this but also by Moodle<br>i've given information there it's<br>editing your profile so believe for my<br>work absorb it's the top right-hand<br>corner I'm not sure but Moodle might be<br>the same here in so we have a very<br>spoken about student learning they offer<br>a wide range of services for academic<br>support and brilliant brilliant staff so<br>they can make it be available to you by<br>a zoom or they might have online<br>workshops but that page we took you to<br>before is definitely a place to go and<br>check out and you can book a<br>consultation<br>they cover yes general grammar and<br>punctuation but building your<br>assessments you know if you're looking<br>at oral presentation how to do so how to<br>research and what's a really important<br>thing is APA referencing this is the<br>referencing style that we use at the<br>University of Waikato and so I mentioned<br>that in Moodle is where you submit your<br>assessment it actually goes through a<br>program to gnihton and that picks up I<br>actually talked about this in the next<br>slide but it's important that you<br>reference properly analyze the system<br>picks it up Studio City is something you<br>should definitely consider using it is<br>our online tutoring service so it's free<br>for students it can be lies or you can<br>submit some written assessment for them<br>to help you with give you guidance<br>you're not going to give you answers but<br>students talk about really gives them<br>confidence to be able to submit their<br>assessment so this is available in<br>Moodle and it would be and a resource<br>station so go there they'll also have an<br>app you'll be able to download from<br>there and it's available 24 24 hours so<br>it doesn't miss at what time it's not<br>like the student learning for example<br>they're a team on campus 8:30 to 5:00<br>I'm not sure they offering after hours<br>where is the studio obviously yeah it's<br>tweaked we'll see them that's great so<br>just you know 24/7 means not 24 hours a<br>day 7 days a week the lingo apologies so<br>as you're studying you may come across<br>some times that you're struggling to<br>complete some assessment due to<br>situations out of your control you might<br>be unwell or something with your family<br>or all kinds a lot going on with over 19<br>we really do want you to reach us that<br>we can help support you so there is a<br>special consideration application<br>process under Moodle and each paper the<br>resource season there will be forms that<br>you would need to fill out that needs to<br>be sent to the department when three day<br>within three days of the due date so<br>these does need to be an implication and<br>writing and if you have any evidence to<br>support it so a medical certificate or<br>correspondence something to help<br>so this you work with your lecturer to<br>get an extension for example and that's<br>very important and if you are unwell go<br>and see a doctor to get the medical<br>certificate and not just saying your<br>family member I don't think I will take<br>that into consideration if you're asking<br>a mum to write a statement but I do need<br>medical certificate that's what we look<br>at as evidence<br>yeah and yeah if it's in doubt just have<br>it checked your lecturer in advance of<br>the assessment is definitely better then<br>you have more options but make sure<br>those are trying to be as flexible as<br>possible given that people you know<br>studying remotely and then being a<br>person so yeah do get in contact with<br>them plagiarism so I talked about the<br>software when you're I'll talk when<br>you're submitting your assessment on<br>Moodle it is to return as the program<br>that uses and so it picks up if you<br>don't reference something properly so<br>this key sentences you can use other<br>people's ideas to support your work in<br>research but you must acknowledge that<br>the ideas are not your own and that's<br>where the referencing comes in also if<br>you're doing your online tests with<br>friends and you both have the same<br>answers that will be picked up and you<br>will be unity other conversations but<br>the your the research in the university<br>disciplinary committee and well that's<br>gone through the process yeah so it is<br>really important to get that right we do<br>have other resources I talked about<br>student learning being able to help but<br>even the library if you were to go on<br>our website and put APA referencing<br>there's actually a guide here<br>so yet do learned also an orientation if<br>you look at the orientation page we<br>could do that now actually look that's<br>alright if we can stop sharing there is<br>a link to an orientation page they've<br>got a academic integrity module that you<br>should definitely do that as<br>disciplining students they've got this<br>whole width page of resources so what<br>I've talked about Moodle for example<br>they've got videos that you can follow<br>to learn how to use it is all kinds<br>University 101 hopefully you were<br>participating in all these activities<br>and the videos so this is a page here<br>thank you<br>so if you keep scrolling down for<br>example this international student<br>citizen support would be really helpful<br>and these Moodle modules they keep<br>scrolling down there academic integrity<br>is definitely one to do so the useful<br>web links are down there so you'll be a<br>get student learning or so they started<br>so that's the serious topic I think need<br>so I'm just going to raise that we have<br>clubs there are around a hundred<br>affiliated clubs with our Waikato<br>Student Union that range from academic<br>to lifestyle interest or hobby stuff so<br>these are student clubs and students<br>running in for students I would take<br>that tour now thank you<br>so yes it's not just what you know it's<br>who you know acknowledging that it is a<br>bit difficult being overseas but<br>management school we've got a number of<br>clubs and they promote their and a lot<br>of opportunities online by Facebook and<br>Instagram I don't know bikini Instagram<br>time<br>but we could post up a wiecek perhaps<br>yes but this has to be weird they do<br>exist and when you do come to campus<br>recommend you get involved our<br>management clubs they introduce us<br>students to opportunities not just at<br>the university but it's also the<br>business world so they run various<br>events throughout the year<br>engaging in our management students so<br>social activities Network events with<br>business industry workshops for self<br>development<br>so Stephanie
