Costanza also co-founded the elmo's<br>present for a period of time the<br>International Society for ecological<br>economics that's where we met in 1992<br>currently on that he is on 10 editorial<br>boards of various international academic<br>journals he is also the founding editor<br>and chief of solutions which you might<br>want to pass out so people take good<br>luck good look at it it's very unique<br>hybrid academic popular journal that you<br>could take a look at and then he is also<br>the author or co-author of over 500<br>scientific papers 27 books his work has<br>been cited in more than 17,000<br>scientific articles he's given over 3<br>hundred interviews and his work appears<br>in various popular media as well so<br>please join me in welcoming to the<br>podium dr. thank you thanks Marie on to<br>the kind introduction let's see so<br>things have changed on on the earth<br>recently you've probably heard the term<br>Anthropocene who's heard the term<br>Anthropocene before okay we have an<br>informed audience you know that we don't<br>live in an empty world any longer we<br>live in a world that's it's full of<br>humans and their influence and that<br>means that business as usual is no<br>longer an option<br>Paul Raskin that said it's business as<br>usual is the utopian fantasy we have to<br>make a transformation into a more<br>sustainable and desirable future if we<br>want to maintain our presence here on<br>planet earth and in a desirable way we<br>know that we have exceeded several<br>planetary boundaries probably seen some<br>version of this this diagram as well<br>where a large group of us got together<br>and tried to establish nowhere where it<br>is the safe operating space in terms of<br>the fundamental ecological constraints<br>on planet Earth and we recognize that at<br>least three of them are probably already<br>outside the safe operating space climate<br>change biodiversity loss and a nitrogen<br>cycle and several others rapidly<br>approaching to the safe boundaries<br>now which microphone to get closer to<br>how about that one how's that okay<br>so however framing the issue in that way<br>these are certainly truths but they're<br>very inconvenient truths this is not the<br>movie that most people are lining up to<br>go see so I think the problem here is<br>partly how we how we frame the issues<br>about the future that in fact we need a<br>third movie we need a movie that's a<br>much more positive vision of a<br>sustainable and desirable economy in<br>society in nature I put it in those<br>terms just to emphasize the fact that we<br>need to re-envision and what the economy<br>is it's not this isolated thing that's<br>separate from the rest of nature or from<br>society it's it's a it's completely<br>embedded in the rest of society the rest<br>the rest of the natural world so I think<br>going forward if our goals are to create<br>this sustainable and desirable future we<br>have to start with that that changing<br>vision we have to recognize that yes<br>there are planetary boundaries that we<br>need to maintain but we also have the<br>elements of well-being and quality of<br>life you know within those boundaries<br>that we have to build and maintain what<br>Kate gray worth is called the the donut<br>so we have a sort of planetary ceiling<br>but a social floor that we have to live<br>within so that I think is our ongoing<br>challenge how do we create this<br>sustainable and desirable future that<br>combines those different elements<br>sustainable scale and but also high<br>quality of life there been some<br>significant movements I think in a<br>positive direction around this you've<br>probably all heard about the UN<br>sustainable development goals that<br>recognize that our our goals are are<br>much broader these goals apply to all<br>countries unlike the Millennium<br>Development Goals which were really<br>directed at quote-unquote developing<br>countries these goals apply to all<br>countries and you can see from this list<br>you know they include things like<br>and general inequality or equality we<br>include action on climate include<br>maintaining both marine and terrestrial<br>resources reducing poverty you know<br>moving towards renewable energy economic<br>growth is included but it's it's it's<br>modified as inclusive and sustainable<br>economic growth so what what does that<br>mean so there's a much broader set of<br>goals I think that all countries<br>including New Zealand have signed on to<br>the question is you know what what do<br>these goals mean and I think one<br>important aspect is that all of these<br>goals are not independent from each<br>other they're all interconnected there<br>there are many trade-offs and and<br>synergies among these different goals<br>and it's important to recognize that<br>they all ultimately contribute to an<br>overarching goal of a prosperous high<br>quality of life that's equitably shared<br>and sustainable I think there's growing<br>consensus that that's what we're really<br>after going forward that to achieve that<br>we need to have a sustainable scale of<br>the economy within the within society<br>and the life support system within<br>planetary boundaries we need a fair<br>distribution of resources both within<br>the current generation of humans but<br>also between current and future<br>generations and between humans and other<br>species and we need an efficient<br>allocation of resources but that<br>allocation needs to include recognition<br>of the value of natural capital and<br>ecosystem services and the value of<br>social capital etc so it's a it's a<br>complex system process and I think<br>creating this and achieving this<br>overarching goal is going to require<br>that we better understand how this whole<br>system functions you know in a better<br>way so focus today on natural capital<br>and ecosystem services and their<br>contribution to sustainable well-being<br>but recognizing that these other aspects<br>are also important you've probably heard<br>about or seen the Millennium ecosystem<br>assessment this is their version of the<br>the list of these services which they<br>aggregate into these four basic<br>categories of provisioning ready<br>cultural and supporting services who's<br>who's seen this before<br>so okay almost many of you and how they<br>contribute to the various constituents<br>of human well-being<br>let's go much beyond simply more<br>consumption to know health and social<br>relations security etc you know all the<br>benefits that people derive from<br>functioning ecosystems from natural<br>capital there is something missing from<br>this diagram I I think though and that's<br>the interaction with the other forms of<br>capital so I think it's this is maybe a<br>clearer picture of what's what we're<br>talking about their goal is sustainable<br>well-being that these four basic types<br>of capital assets are all required in<br>some more balanced way to produce that<br>that well-being<br>natural capital doesn't just flow into<br>into well-being it requires built human<br>capital individual people built<br>infrastructure social capital or<br>societies and some more balanced<br>interaction to create sustainable<br>well-being and we're talking about when<br>we talk about the value of natural<br>capital and ecosystem services is what's<br>their contribution in this in this<br>interaction to sustainable even<br>well-being so it's not all about markets<br>but markets are one institution that's<br>that's there to to allocate these<br>resources but certainly not the only one<br>or the most appropriate one in many<br>cases there's been a lot of traction I<br>think recently on this idea of ecosystem<br>services you may have heard of the IP<br>BES in Intergovernmental Panel on<br>biodiversity and ecosystem services<br>which is sort of equivalent to the IPCC<br>and I'm talking about these these issues<br>so this will do ongoing assessments of<br>ecosystem services globally and as a<br>participated in by almost all countries<br>there's the ecosystem services<br>partnership which you may be aware of<br>take a look at this website if you want<br>to see you know who's who's doing what<br>in this area around the world large<br>membership organization but includes<br>both academics and practitioners and<br>policy and policy people<br>it's an interesting memo that was<br>released recently last October by the<br>Obama administration requiring all US<br>federal agencies to incorporate<br>ecosystem services into their their<br>decision-making so it's beginning to<br>affect that sort of level of<br>policymaking in the United States the EU<br>has a similar kind of directive the<br>biodiversity strategy directive that<br>recognizes the value of natural capital<br>and the need in target2 to maintain and<br>restore ecosystems and their and their<br>services so there are several<br>initiatives that are that are headed in<br>the right direction this is an<br>interesting one Ken Henry who is the<br>former treasurer of Australia who's now<br>the chair of the National Australia Bank<br>I gave a a an address recently<br>emphasizing that natural capital is not<br>a footnote in the business plan it's a<br>core asset of the balance sheet and<br>that's true for individual businesses<br>and it's also true for the for the<br>nation<br>so nad is actively involved in trying to<br>put natural capital you know on the<br>balance sheet and I think this sort of<br>thing could have some real influence on<br>people's decision-making if banks begin<br>to adjust their loans who they loan to<br>what their interest rates are based on<br>how well businesses and farmers are are<br>maintaining their natural capital assets<br>as well as their other assets that could<br>have a real influence on people's<br>people's behavior going forward so if<br>you look at the NAB website it looks<br>something like this they have a whole<br>whole section on natural value what it<br>is and and how they hope to encourage<br>and maintain it so the idea of valuing<br>these services in a range of different<br>ways how do we how do we assess how much<br>they're contributing to human wellbeing<br>and sustainable welding well there's a<br>range of uses for those values including<br>simply raising awareness and interest is<br>just sort of making it clear that that<br>ecosystems are not just a pretty picture<br>but they're actually supporting almost<br>everything that we do in life<br>adjusting national income and well-being<br>accounts I think there's another major<br>effort how do we get beyond this sort of<br>misplaced emphasis on GDP growth as our<br>primary policy grohl and how do we make<br>sure that that the value of natural<br>capital social capital and other things<br>are incorporated into our our overall<br>national goals we can use these<br>valuations for specific policy analyses<br>for urban and regional land use planning<br>how do we create landscapes that<br>actually maximize the value of the whole<br>landscape this idea payment for<br>ecosystem services how can we reward<br>individuals and and and others for<br>enhancing and preserving those services<br>full cost accounting how do we get the<br>prices right how do we get the market to<br>stop telling us to start telling us the<br>truth about the full cost of what we're<br>producing and consuming I'll say a<br>little bit more about that and how do we<br>create better institutions for managing<br>these services which are in large part<br>public goods and not amenable to being<br>dealt with in private markets this is an<br>interesting paper I ran across that asks<br>a group of 80 different managers Marine<br>Australian coastal and marine managers<br>they asked them how important was this<br>issue of valuation to this range of<br>different ecosystem services on a on a<br>scale from zero to a hundred percent and<br>see that most of them thought that the<br>these that valuation was either<br>important high or medium importance to<br>to almost all of these ecosystem<br>services and compare that however with<br>their trust in the estimates of the<br>value of these ecosystem services which<br>was a little bit lower higher in some<br>cases but you know not not as high in<br>other cases so I think there's still a<br>lot of work to be done in terms of the<br>research behind estimating what these<br>reefs means these resources are worth<br>how they interact with human well-being<br>and sustainability<br>there's been there has been a lot of<br>growth in the academic area and the<br>number of research articles published on<br>this topic of ecosystem services this is<br>just from from Scopus over time from you<br>know back in 1985 which is kind of the<br>first mention of the term I think in the<br>scientific literature up until the<br>present they're now more than 2000<br>articles in the year are published on<br>this on this topic area so a lot of a<br>lot of scientific research going on the<br>most highly cited of those papers is<br>this one that you might recognize a few<br>names here so Mariana and I together<br>with this large group of authors met at<br>the National Center for ecological<br>analysis and synthesis in Santa Barbara<br>in 1996 and tried to synthesize all of<br>the work that had been done up until<br>that point on this issue of valuation of<br>ecosystem services and so we came up<br>with an estimate based on that at 17<br>different services across 16 different<br>biomes several hundred papers that we<br>that we put together and came up with an<br>estimate of around 33 trillion dollars a<br>year significantly larger than global<br>GDP at the time this paper has been<br>cited many more times than I ever<br>expected it to be certainly at the time<br>one thing we didn't control was what<br>they put on the cover of the magazine<br>and they said pricing the planet we<br>didn't really mean pricing we met<br>valuing at the planet because I think<br>there is a clear distinction there<br>between prices and markets and bet least<br>value as assuming that these are<br>exchange values and most of it is<br>outside the market that's the whole<br>point that that many of these Kennedy<br>systems are providing contributions to<br>well-being that are not that are not<br>marketed probably should not be marketed<br>but are nevertheless extremely valuable<br>more valuable and total than all of the<br>stuff that is marketed in GDP so that's<br>been I put this one in it's not just to<br>give you an idea of where this paper<br>stands in the steam<br>all papers published and included in the<br>isi web of science and this is from this<br>article that came out recently where<br>they looked at the top 100 most cited<br>papers and the top 10 most cited papers<br>the top one was cited like three hundred<br>thousand times but this little diagram<br>here shows you the stack view stacked up<br>the first pages of all the papers that<br>are included in the isi database it<br>would reach almost to the top of mount<br>kilimanjaro about half of them are never<br>cited the next this part were cited<br>between one and ten times etc all the<br>way up to here this stack here is the<br>top metre and a half I think of ones<br>that were cited more than a thousand<br>times and our paper was about here about<br>six thousand two hundred citations so<br>far and is I so it's been cited more<br>times than the Watson and Crick paper<br>about about DNA and several other papers<br>that might I might think are important I<br>put this up just to show the the level<br>of sort of academic interest in this<br>issue going forward so more recently as<br>part of the teeb study the economics of<br>ecosystems and biodiversity which was<br>funded by the Deutsche Bank and unep<br>there was a an update assessment of the<br>value of these various services over<br>these different biomes and this is just<br>the summary diagram I'm not showing you<br>bye-bye biomes the Serve range of values<br>that you get out you can see that some<br>systems like coral reefs are extremely<br>valuable per hectare this is in dollars<br>per hectare per year<br>even though there's a large range of<br>these values the mean values urks or a<br>pretty pretty high and again I'm not<br>claiming that these are very precise<br>estimates but these estimates do<br>indicate that this contribution is is<br>large more recently we tried to assess<br>well what has changed since in that time<br>period between 1997 and 2011 in this<br>case in terms of the value of those<br>services and we estimated that<br>cuz of Landy's change largely largely<br>the the the estimates of the value have<br>increased but because of land-use change<br>per hectare anyway because of land-use<br>change the total value the total<br>contribution has gone down by around 20<br>trillion dollars a year so there's been<br>deserted vacation that's been lost<br>before weeks there's been depletion of<br>many of the more valuable systems or<br>conversion into the less valuable<br>ecosystems probably can't read this but<br>just to give you an idea of how we did<br>that we just looked at how land use had<br>changed over that time period how the<br>unit values have changed and there has<br>been all of that additional research in<br>general that has showed that the<br>estimates of the value have increased<br>all the green numbers go up the red<br>values don't go down by very much from<br>these estimates and then you can you can<br>differentiate by updating the 1997<br>values 245 trillion is what it would be<br>in in two thousand seven dollars what<br>happens if you change only the unit<br>values then there was a significant<br>increase we underestimated by quite a<br>bit if you use the new unit values if<br>you change only the land area you get<br>this number so the difference between<br>this one and that one is four point<br>three trillion if you change both you<br>get the difference between this total<br>and this so or twenty trillion or so so<br>again an estimate question is going<br>forward what do we do about that we're<br>sort of on a downward trend with the<br>value of ecosystem services if we want<br>to create the sustainable and desirable<br>future we have to change our policies so<br>as part of a project called the<br>economics of land degradation we looked<br>at a series of future scenarios in this<br>case scenarios done by the great<br>transition initiative and they broke the<br>they had four scenarios that they looked<br>at market forces this kind of business<br>as usual the great transition is I would<br>say similar to if we actually achieved<br>all of the sustainable development goals<br>policy reform is is more government<br>planning but let's still a focus on GDP<br>growth<br>and fortress world is kind of the<br>collapse scenario here's a description<br>of those and you can go onto the GTI<br>website and have a very elaborate<br>website that describes these four<br>scenarios I won't go into details here<br>but they also had some projections of<br>land use going forward out to the year<br>2050 for each of these scenarios so we<br>took those land use projections for each<br>of the four scenarios I mentioned and<br>we're able to map those globally and you<br>see the current land use description the<br>four different scenarios I know it's<br>quite difficult to see the differences<br>at this scale but there are significant<br>differences particularly if you look at<br>for example the well let's see<br>desertification in Australia and other<br>parts of the world that led to a these<br>projections of the future of ecosystem<br>services a decline from 1997 to 2011<br>under the fortress world and and market<br>forces scenario is a continuing decline<br>you could stabilize the value of those<br>resources with policy reform scenario<br>but it's also possible with the great<br>transition to reverse that trend and and<br>restore the value of those services<br>going forward out to 2050 and again I<br>emphasize that the sustainable<br>development goals if implemented would<br>be fairly similar I think to that<br>transition here's what it would look<br>like in terms of percent changes from<br>the 2011 values of ecosystem services<br>under those four different scenarios so<br>it varies a bit by country depending on<br>what land uses are involved but in<br>general a positive trend a very positive<br>trend under the great transition sort of<br>mixed under policy reform and definitely<br>negative under the other two so we know<br>from other from other data that when we<br>make these land-use transitions there<br>are there's often a net loss in the<br>value of ecosystem services again it's<br>from the Millennium assessment when you<br>convert from intact wetlands through<br>intensive farming<br>you're improving perhaps the private<br>benefits but the social benefits are<br>decreased significantly by more than<br>half<br>likewise for other land use transitions<br>a few years ago we looked at the a<br>scenario an assessment at the global<br>scale of the benefit cost ratio of<br>conserving our our natural capital and<br>this one was based on a scenario of<br>increasing the global reserve network to<br>cover 15 percent at the terrestrial<br>biosphere 30 percent of the marine<br>biosphere that would cost under this<br>scenario about forty five billion a year<br>but the benefits would be the net the<br>difference in value between the intact<br>system and what it might be converted to<br>about four to five trillion dollars a<br>year so a benefit cost ratio of on the<br>order of a hundred to one and other<br>subsequent studies have showed similar<br>kinds of benefit cost ratios of<br>investing in preserving our natural<br>capital assets much better returns I<br>would say that most other things you<br>could think of investing your money in<br>these days the only other better<br>investment I could find was oil<br>companies investing in political<br>campaigns in the United States which is<br>about four hundred to one<br>unfortunately so in terms of full cost<br>accounting you may have heard of this<br>company called true costs that had been<br>involved with that that tries to do just<br>that they assess the the full cost by<br>company the external cost of their their<br>activities not just their the company's<br>activities itself but also their<br>suppliers activities and their supplier<br>suppliers all the way down the supply<br>chain what are the environmental and<br>health costs associated with company's<br>operations and they found in a recent<br>study that probably more than half of<br>companies in the world are really not<br>producing a social profit they're just<br>calling their environmental costs profit<br>so not actually doing anything of<br>benefit to society in the long term so<br>how do we get that information into the<br>into the decision-making system and do a<br>real and do a better job of low cost<br>accounting<br>ultimately I think we need to do a much<br>better job of modeling and the dynamics<br>and spatial performance of ecosystem<br>services and there's a lot of work going<br>on now on how to do that this is just<br>one example of a system that we've been<br>working on that tries to integrate<br>across that at multiple spatial scales<br>this whole range of components and doing<br>integrated systems modeling approach<br>multi scale integrated models of<br>ecosystem services we call it and I<br>think we can go beyond that actually and<br>try to use these underlying landscape<br>models as the basis for interactive<br>games that people can play who's played<br>Pokemon go so far I've heard that<br>currently we spend about three billion<br>hours a week playing computer games of<br>various kinds so and how can we use that<br>or at least part of that time to<br>actually do something a little more<br>productive and to to build what you<br>might call integrated games that combine<br>both entertainment research and<br>education so there's been a lot of work<br>you know on game theory and using games<br>and in that sense there's certainly a<br>lot of use of games for entertainment<br>and for education but I think we can put<br>all three of those together we've had a<br>simulation model of a landscape we can<br>actually keep track of all of the<br>decisions that people make when they're<br>playing that game and begin to<br>understand how they understand and how<br>they value different components<br>ecosystem services in the system so you<br>can use it for creating for<br>understanding valuation of ecosystem<br>services and also for educating people<br>about what those services are so I think<br>and finally on the issue of integrating<br>these elements into national income<br>accounting I think it's well beyond time<br>to leave GDP behind as our major policy<br>goal at the national level GDP was never<br>designed for that purpose it's really a<br>very specialized measure of production<br>and consumption in the in the economy it<br>has a lot of problems when you try to<br>you know use it for the purpose of a<br>national policy goal there are a lot of<br>things left out of GDP there are a lot<br>of things included that probably that<br>probably shouldn't be if there's more<br>oil spills you know somebody has to go<br>clean that up there's going to be<br>increased GDP we don't want more oil<br>spills we don't want crime we don't want<br>more pollution but all those things are<br>included and so there has been a lot of<br>effort I think in recent times to create<br>alternatives to GDP and I'll just talk<br>about a few of them<br>this paper looked at just some a subset<br>that you can divide into these three<br>basic categories one is our indicators<br>that that modify GDP in some way that<br>are denominated in dollars units and<br>I'll talk a little bit more about the<br>genuine progress indicator there's a<br>group that that are based on surveys of<br>subjective well-being the world value<br>survey is probably the best-known one of<br>those Bhutan has been using something<br>called the gross national happiness<br>index so you can ask ask people you know<br>how satisfied are they with their life<br>and then there's a whole range of<br>indicators that are built up from<br>different indicators that are that are<br>either weighted or unweighted going to<br>an overall index of Human Development<br>Index from the UN the Happy Planet Index<br>the OECD is better life index is a more<br>is a a recent one that's kind of<br>interesting so there's been a range of<br>things going on there this is from the<br>world happiness report that just came<br>out so this is based on life<br>satisfaction scores across different<br>countries<br>you probably can't read any of the names<br>of the countries here this is all 157<br>countries in the world starting with<br>anybody want to guess with the most the<br>happiest country in the world according<br>to this e Denmark Denmark Switzerland<br>Iceland Norway Finland Canada a lot of<br>Scandinavian countries Netherlands it's<br>seven new zealand comes out very pretty<br>well on this there number eight<br>just above australia but well above the<br>united kingdom and the united states are<br>well down the list etc so what was<br>interesting about this was they also<br>tried to explain the variation in these<br>world happiness scores and the amount<br>that's explained by GDP is really a<br>relatively minor component so there are<br>other components that are about social<br>support about life expectancy about so<br>about health social capital not really a<br>lot about natural capital or ecosystem<br>services but this blue area is all the<br>unexplained variation so I think that's<br>that's something that needs to be<br>included we know from other research<br>that if you plot GDP per capita versus<br>mean life satisfaction in these surveys<br>you get graphs that look like this where<br>there's there's a rapid increase at<br>first but beyond a certain point there's<br>really not much more improvement in life<br>satisfaction as GDP per capita goes up<br>Costa Rica is just as happy as the<br>United States with a third of the GDP<br>per capita this is the OECD better life<br>index and I would direct you to this<br>website which is which is very nicely<br>done where they have these 11 different<br>indicators they start out weighting them<br>all the same but you can adjust that on<br>the website so you can say well if I if<br>I think that environment is much more<br>important and you can change that weight<br>and you can see how that changes the<br>ranking so the OECD countries at least<br>and this one Australia comes out on the<br>top of the heap at least with with equal<br>weightings followed by Scandinavia and<br>New Zealand his way down weight not way<br>down here but down<br>here interestingly enough if if you look<br>at regions and cities Canberra came out<br>to be you know the best city in the<br>world agreed to the OECD better life<br>index so that I don't know if that<br>anyway it's pretty interesting and what<br>they're doing is collecting people's<br>response this year so they're looking at<br>how people wait these different elements<br>and they're collecting all of that to<br>see you know what how people wait wait<br>things and can use that to adjust them<br>let me say a little bit more about the<br>genuine progress indicator which is one<br>that at least can go back historically<br>and look at trends over time back to the<br>back to the 50s at least this is a<br>version of the index of sustainable<br>economic welfare which was created by<br>Herman Daly and John Cobb back in 1989<br>it starts with personal consumption<br>expenditures which are a major component<br>of GDP but then it weights them by<br>income distribution just to recognize<br>that a dollars worth of income to a rich<br>person doesn't produce as much welfare<br>at well being as the dollars worth of<br>income to a poor person GDP doesn't care<br>about distribution now so if Donald<br>Trump made all the GDP in the country it<br>would be exactly the same as if that<br>were equally distributed among all the<br>entire population it adds a few things<br>that are left out like household labor<br>and volunteer work good things but are<br>not marketed so they're not included in<br>GDP subtracts a bunch of things that<br>probably shouldn't be counted as pluses<br>the loss of leisure time that costs of<br>crime auto accidents family breakdown<br>you know one way to increase GDP is to<br>get a divorce yes so you have two<br>households and two cars etc and then a<br>range of things that are natural capital<br>related so the costs of air and water<br>pollution and lots of wetlands and<br>farmland etc so this has been done for<br>several countries including the United<br>States and you get this is a comparison<br>of on an index scale where 1980 or so is<br>a hundred of GDP per capita is the blue<br>the blue line GPI per capita is<br>red line so it trucks GDP quite well<br>until about 1980 and then has leveled<br>off even though GDP has gone up and you<br>can compare that with life satisfaction<br>which is also going down in the US the<br>Human Development Index is going up<br>slightly the ecological footprint<br>biocapacity compare that with China and<br>look over here at the numbers again so<br>you know for the US GDP goes from a<br>hundred to maybe 170 over that time<br>period for China it goes from a hundred<br>to 360 so GDP has been going through the<br>roof in China per capita GPI what again<br>was tracking it till about 1995 in this<br>case and then as leveled off since then<br>so increasing income inequality in China<br>which is now as bad as it is in the<br>United States increasing air and water<br>pollution you've been to Beijing or<br>Shanghai recently you know what that's<br>like so that's sort of canceled out in<br>terms of well-being all of this growth<br>in GDP we looked at 17 different<br>countries for which GPI has been<br>estimated and this is Vicky's work I<br>think on on New Zealand is this line<br>you've compared with Australia which is<br>a little bit higher and it's been going<br>up slightly but many of the countries<br>have the same pattern as as we saw in<br>the US data and put all that together<br>into a global GPI per capita versus<br>global GDP per capita estimate and it<br>looks something like this where we've<br>gone from a period of economic growth in<br>the post war world war ii period till<br>about 1980 or so where the economy was<br>growing it was also improving wellbeing<br>to a period of what you might call an<br>economic growth the economy is growing<br>but it's not really improving well-being<br>or welfare so it's not really economic<br>in that in that sense so a couple of<br>states in the US have picked up this<br>genuine progress indicator and now using<br>it to make their policy decisions<br>Marilyn was the first state if you look<br>at their website it's got a very good<br>description of all of the elements that<br>go into GPI where they got the data from<br>and also what sort of policies they're<br>implementing to improve GPI rather than<br>than GDP there's also a little special<br>on the Public Broadcasting System<br>Newshour about<br>the problems with GDP and using GP I<br>Vermont is a second state that<br>incorporated GP I in fact they passed<br>legislation that makes it a requirement<br>now to estimate the genuine progress<br>indicator every every year so so<br>building the future that we want<br>requires that we measure what we want I<br>think it's important that we begin to<br>incorporate natural and social capital<br>into our assessments at many different<br>scales<br>you know from individual policies up to<br>the national level but we have to<br>remember it's better to be approximately<br>right than precisely wrong so one<br>justification for sticking to GDP and<br>that we can measure it precisely even<br>though we can't really measure it that<br>precisely if you get right down to it<br>but that's no excuse for continuing to<br>ignore the things that we can't measure<br>as precisely but we know are even more<br>important than the things that are<br>included in GDP and to create the<br>sustainable and desirable economy in<br>society in nature requires that we break<br>this addiction and I and I think of it<br>very much as an addiction to this growth<br>at all costs economic paradigm fossil<br>fuels to over overconsumption the reason<br>we haven't changed more quickly I think<br>is that there are a lot of positive<br>feedbacks in the short run even though<br>there are long term costs and dis<br>benefits so how do we how do we how do<br>we create the societal therapy that's<br>going to be required to make this<br>transformation and I think part of that<br>has to do with envisioning a more<br>sustainable and desirable future that<br>focuses on quality of life it's not a<br>sacrifice to to make this transition<br>it's really a sacrifice not to we are<br>really depleting our quality of life by<br>continuing down the the<br>business-as-usual path and we could<br>create a more a higher quality of life<br>if we shift to eat a system that's<br>focused more on quality of life that<br>embraces the sustainable development<br>goals as our as our our countries have<br>already agreed to and that begins to<br>implement those sorts of those sorts of<br>policies</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
