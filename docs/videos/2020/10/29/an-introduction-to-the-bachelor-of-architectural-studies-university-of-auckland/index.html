My name is Deidre Brown, and I'm the <br>head of the School of Architecture and Planning.<br>It's great to be talking with you today.  <br>My journey? I trained as an <br>architect within this very school.<br>I went to Lynfield College. I was really <br>interested in art and design, but also  <br>history and maths, and so this seemed like a <br>great combination of skills to take forward.<br>I was also really interested in what I could <br>do with my life in terms of improving society,  <br>in terms of making it a better place, <br>so I felt architecture was right for me.<br>It enables you to work with a built environment,  <br>to create environments that are going to change <br>people's lives, that will have a longevity.<br>The buildings that our graduates are designing <br>in school today and when they go out into  <br>practice will still be standing in 100 to <br>150 years time, so this is real stuff and  <br>it really helps the world, so I encourage <br>you to think about studying Architecture.<br>I'll turn now to one of our students, Cindy.<br>Hi everyone. My name is Cindy.<br>I am a fourth-year Architecture <br>student right now doing my Master  <br>of Architecture at the University of Auckland.<br>I also did my bachelors at the University, <br>and I come from Avondale College.<br>Kia ora. I'm Tane. I'm also a fourth-year <br>Master of Architecture (Professional) student.  <br>I did a Bachelor of Arts straight out of high <br>school and then took a break and then decided to  <br>come back and follow my passion for architecture <br>which has been really rewarding so far.<br>I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do <br>for my university degree, to be honest.  <br>I think my interests lay in drawing, and so I <br>enjoyed art, and I took art painting, art design.<br>I did graphics, but also the other side of <br>me was quite like an academic kind of person,  <br>and so I wasn't really fully prepared to do fully <br>fine arts, and then wasn't really fully prepared  <br>to just do engineering. So in between that I was <br>like, "maybe architecture would be the route."  <br>Yeah, so that's sort of how I came about to pick <br>this degree and I fully, fully, fully, enjoy it.<br>I think that's a really good thing as well. <br>The main, one of the kind of key things about  <br>Architecture, it is really broad. Both, you know, <br>in the discipline you can do everything from fine  <br>artsy kind of like installation work, all the <br>way up to, you know, technical engineering,  <br>facade engineering, build adaptable facades <br>and all that kind of stuff as well, this  <br>high sort of sustainability science end of it as <br>well and, so it allows you to kind of start broad  <br>and then find your interests as you go through <br>the degree and I think that's really valuable.<br>So the Bachelor of Architectural Studies? <br>It's a three-year degree. It might sound long,  <br>but it's going to go really quick because <br>we have so many exciting things to do,  <br>and you are just going to love <br>learning in this environment.<br>Most of the courses are around studio, <br>so it's about half of what you do,  <br>and that's where we learn how to design <br>buildings. And around that, we have media  <br>which includes freehand drawing and everything <br>through to computer-aided drawing as well.<br>We study the history of architecture, and <br>we also study sustainability and technology,  <br>and all of these subjects come into the studio <br>programme to enhance what you do in design.<br>So Cindy, how did you find your <br>first year of Architecture?<br>First year, you experience the studio culture <br>where a lot of students sort of all mingle  <br>and learn together in a really tight classroom <br>environment, and you bounce a lot of ideas off  <br>each other, you help each other, and you <br>quickly become friends with everyone, and  <br>you grow, and you learn together <br>throughout all three years of bachelors.<br>Studio is a really great kind of collaborative <br>learning environment. Everyone's kind of  <br>hanging out. It's also the place where <br>you spend a lot of time when you're not  <br>strictly in class, and so it's just a really nice <br>and unique kind of way to learn about a subject.<br>But yeah, also I think for me, first year <br>coming into Architecture, I expected it to  <br>be exclusively about buildings which <br>obviously, as Cindy said, it's not.<br>It's art. It's history. It's sociology. It's <br>kind of all of the things. It's on both sides.  <br>It's science. And so you get to, through your <br>time during the BAS programme, you kind of get  <br>to figure out what you're actually interested <br>in within the built environment and kind of  <br>focus on that as well, which I think is really <br>good. So it's really broad and flexible, yeah.<br>So the academic year is split into Semester <br>One and Semester Two, with four papers in each  <br>semester. In first year, you'd be doing media, <br>design, technology, and history, and also for  <br>one of the semesters you would be doing a General <br>Education paper to sort of broaden your scope and  <br>interest into other fields of studies such as Fine <br>Arts or Computer Science or stuff like that, yeah.<br>So you learn in a lot of different <br>places too within the school.<br>So there's studio that we've talked <br>about. There's wonderful big open  <br>spaces where you have small group <br>learning, and you have your lectures,  <br>and also there's the workshops downstairs that you <br>can use to do woodwork, metalwork, CNC, digital.<br>So how in the course of a day <br>would you kind of move across  <br>in between these spaces as part of your learning?<br>I think it's really dynamic. It really depends <br>on what project you're doing and day to day  <br>where you are at is like everywhere, really. <br>So, for example, if you're doing a design paper,  <br>you might head down in the workshop, and there's a <br>lot of different types of technicians to help you.<br>Whether or not it's woodworks or metalworks, <br>they're really, really skilful people and you sort  <br>of tell them, "Hey, I'm looking to do this," and <br>they'll help you figure things out. And then you  <br>might come back into the studio in the afternoon <br>and do some work at your desk and talk with your  <br>friends, discuss some projects and then later <br>you might have like a lecture in a lecture room.<br>Maybe it's a history lecture. Yeah, so day to day, <br>it sort of varies depending on your timetable.<br>The Bachelor of Architectural Studies (BAS) <br>is the first step on becoming an architect.<br>So you do your three years in the BAS,  <br>and then you go on to the Master of Architecture <br>(Professional), and that's a two-year degree.<br>But as the leading provider of <br>built world studies in the country,  <br>you have many options within that masters <br>step. So we have combination degrees.  <br>You can combine your Master of Architecture <br>(Professional) with the Master of Urban Planning.<br>You can combine it with a Master of Urban Design.<br>You can combine it with a Master of <br>Heritage Conservation so you actually  <br>come out with multiple qualifications, <br>and you can work across a variety of  <br>fields within the built world industries <br>and beyond. One of the reasons that I  <br>wanted to study architecture is that I have <br>Māori heritage. I'm Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kahu,  <br>and I felt that I could make the world a better <br>place by imbuing the built spaces that we have  <br>with tikanga Māori and Māori values, and I've <br>really found that I've been able to do that,  <br>not just through design but also through teaching <br>and the work that I do here at the school.<br>And one of the great things about the <br>school is that it has a long history  <br>of welcoming Māori and Pasifika students into <br>the school, and those students going on to have  <br>really important careers that make a change and an <br>impact on people's lives at all different levels.  <br>One of the great things that the University has on <br>offer, and I've had these myself, are scholarships  <br>for Māori and Pasifika students and currently, we <br>have three dedicated scholarships for students at  <br>the undergraduate level who are Māori and <br>another scholarship for Pasifika students  <br>and these are endowed by members of the <br>architectural profession because they want  <br>to see more Māori and Pasifika students coming <br>through so we have our scholarships. I think it's  <br>really important that if you are really interested <br>in tikanga Māori or perhaps the Pasifika side of  <br>things that you express that in your portfolio. <br>These are all things that we're looking for.<br>And also, once you get here, there's this <br>amazing support network called Tuākana,  <br>which is here to assist you. And Tane, you've <br>had some experience of the Tuākana programme.<br>Yeah, it's been great. So Tuākana, basically <br>it's a mentoring programme and mentoring system.  <br>We've got exclusive spaces, and yeah, <br>a whole lot of resources that are just  <br>there to help Māori and Pacific students through <br>the programme in a more specific way that kind of  <br>acknowledges cultural backgrounds and encourages <br>that kind of approach to the built environment,  <br>and so it's a really valuable resource, <br>and yeah, we get a lot out of it.<br>The School of Architecture and Planning <br>has an incredible list of staff.<br>Many of them are world-class researchers. <br>They're also excellent teachers, and these  <br>are the permanent staff. We've got a large team <br>of permanent staff, but we also have a small army  <br>of professionals that come in and teach beside us.  <br>Cindy, could you tell us about your <br>experience of working with the teachers?<br>There's quite a mixture of different types of <br>tutors and lecturers that you'll come about to  <br>meet in architecture school. There are full-time <br>staff here who specialise in different areas,  <br>and they also cross between the papers they teach.<br>So your history teacher might be your design <br>tutor the next semester. The University also has  <br>architects who come in to teach a particular <br>design paper, and that's also really interesting.  <br>But also, sometimes tutors get paired with <br>senior students and they teach together,  <br>and that's also quite an interesting experience <br>because you get the sort of professional view,  <br>and then you get a more like a <br>student view on the same project.<br>So every two years, the faculty <br>organises an overseas trip  <br>for Architecture students and the last trip I <br>managed to go, and we went to Morocco and Spain,  <br>which was the most amazing experience ever. And <br>I think it really opens your eyes to architecture  <br>because you realise that it might be so obvious, <br>but it's not when you're actually there,  <br>and you're experiencing the culture, and you're <br>getting to know the people that architecture is  <br>really different and it really reflects the <br>environment, the culture, their technology,  <br>and it's so amazing. In Spain and Morocco, <br>they have a lot of sort of historic buildings,  <br>and that was really eye-opening to <br>be there and to experience all that.<br>So we also do a lot of more local trips as well. <br>There's been some trips organised this year  <br>of Aotearoa architecture, going up <br>into Northland and seeing all of  <br>the kind of historic places and architectural <br>moments that are happening up there as well.  <br>We also frequently go to the islands, <br>depending again, like Cindy said,  <br>there are specific design papers that will involve <br>different briefs and require different, you know,  <br>say, for example, last semester some of our peers <br>were designing for Niue, for a site in Niue. And  <br>so they actually got to go there with some of our <br>staff that are specialists in the area. They got  <br>to go there and hang out for a week and actually <br>experience the site and get everything they needed  <br>to understand about what they were trying <br>to design from actually going to the place.<br>They were talking about, again, <br>experiencing in the culture,  <br>meeting the people, meeting the <br>people that a project might actually  <br>benefit and people who are the actual stakeholders <br>in that, so that's really cool. And so our staff  <br>are always trying to get us as involved or <br>as close as possible to kind of real-world  <br>projects. Sometimes they are actually <br>real-world projects, and other times you're  <br>still kind of meeting with the stakeholders <br>and the people that are important, but yeah.<br>So you guys are probably thinking about getting <br>your portfolios together—a few tips from us.  <br>I guess the first thing is: architecture <br>isn't just buildings, so don't think that  <br>anything you put into your portfolio has to <br>be like a picture or a drawing of a building.  <br>My second tip that I tell a lot of my own students <br>and people that I meet who ask these questions is:  <br>try to be as broad as possible. Try to <br>include lots of different types of media,  <br>do some paintings, some charcoal, some sketches, <br>some digital work. Try to get everything.  <br>Kind of show that you can, that you're adaptable <br>and that you can do a broad range of stuff.<br>If you want specific help with portfolio <br>stuff, there's lots of stuff on YouTube.<br>Some of our staff have put some videos together.<br>Some of our students have put some <br>videos together as well. That's all  <br>on the University website and also, <br>obviously, all the technical info.  <br>But don't leave it to the last minute. Get <br>into it. Yeah, it's your chance, I guess,  <br>to showcase your favourite work. Like I <br>said, it doesn't have to be buildings.  <br>Just express yourself and get your favourite <br>work in there and show us what you can do.<br>So we get asked a whole lot about <br>high school students, about, "oh,  <br>is it really hard work going to architecture <br>school?" and the answer is "yes, but no."<br>It's something that I mean most people <br>who really get into it just love it,  <br>and it just becomes a kind of passion thing, <br>and so you can kind of go as hard as you want.<br>There are obviously always going to be deadlines <br>and stuff that you do have to adhere to, the  <br>kind of stricter things. But at the same time, it <br>gives you a lot of flexibility with how you work,  <br>and over the course of your studies, you're going <br>to develop your own process and your own way of  <br>approaching things. And so you know what you are <br>good at, and you know what you're not good at,  <br>and you can kind of navigate that in a way <br>that suits you best. So it is hard work,  <br>but it's super enjoyable, and it's about learning,  <br>a lot of it is about learning how you work and <br>how to work that suits you the best, so yeah.<br>Yeah, that makes sense. I'm pretty much in line <br>with Tane, but I think what I'd add is you sort of  <br>don't go through the hard work part of things by <br>yourself because everyone in studio are doing the  <br>same papers as you, making the same deadlines as <br>you and so it just feels like almost a team effort  <br>even if it's individual projects. But there are <br>group projects. So I think that kind of diminishes  <br>this feeling of like, "oh, I'm by myself," or <br>"I'm doing all this alone." So in that sense,  <br>I think it's quite enjoyable. Even though there <br>might be hard work, when you reflect, like looking  <br>back on the years you've done, I think you <br>only remember the good parts of things, yeah.<br>Some of the best times I had at crunch <br>time as well, so it's always a lot of fun.<br>So you're probably thinking about money <br>and how you're going to get through this.<br>The University offers a wide range of <br>scholarships, and they're offered at every single  <br>level as well, so there are scholarships here to <br>support you. And how you find them is that you go  <br>on the website and you might be really surprised <br>by what you're eligible for so it's really worth  <br>a look. There's also other opportunities too, and <br>like Cindy and Tane earn extra cash by working in  <br>studio and doing various forms of tutoring, which <br>is really helpful for us. The students really  <br>engage with having senior students involved with <br>them, but it also helps you through the degree.<br>The curriculum here at the University of <br>Auckland Architecture School, I reckon is  <br>sort of like matching with <br>some world-class universities.<br>I think the student work that comes <br>out is really, really of high standard,  <br>and I think that that's really important because <br>that helps develop the whole studio culture  <br>that we have, and I think it's great.<br>And we have lots of opportunities, too, within <br>the programme, don't we? So we have 360,  <br>which enables students to do a semester <br>in another country to learn. And also,  <br>there's these opportunities <br>to do internships as well.<br>My top tip for people looking to get into the <br>University of Auckland Architecture programme?  <br>Keep your mind really open. Stay broad. <br>Like I said with portfolio preparation,  <br>they want to see that you're willing <br>to give everything a go. So yeah,  <br>keep your interest broad. Don't just get focused <br>on architecture. Make sure you're still doing  <br>other things. Make sure you're still playing your <br>sports that you love or, you know, hanging out,  <br>doing things that aren't architecture because that <br>makes you a better architect as well, so yeah.<br>My advice is that if you're sort of in <br>high school and thinking about, "oh,  <br>is architecture going to be the degree for me?" I <br>sort of think architecture as a degree to have is  <br>really useful, and you can apply it in different <br>fields. You don't have to be an architect.  <br>You can equally be an interior designer. You <br>can work on stage sets. You can, you know,  <br>there's so many things that you can do with <br>the skillset that you learn from this degree.<br>There's lots of other things that you can do <br>too, coming out of the programme. So we have a  <br>number of students who go on to become project <br>managers. Some work as quantity surveyors,  <br>and they go out into different parts of the <br>building industry. But you also touched on the  <br>fact that a number of people move into the <br>creative spaces as well. So we've had some  <br>world-famous cinematographers come through here, <br>people who've gone into food and hospitality.<br>I just remember when I first <br>started here being told,<br>"yeah, you could be an architect, but <br>whatever you're going to be is a really  <br>successful person because the skills that <br>you learn here will set you up for life."<br>It turns you into a creative thinker, a technical <br>thinker, a person that can write really well,  <br>and a person that thinks about <br>the world on a global level.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
