But I just really <br>loved composition and I picked it up in 2012  <br>at St Mary's College and <br>just fell in love with it.<br>Hi, my name's Dani and I studied a lot of science <br>in high school. I did biology and chemistry.  <br>I also did art, as well as English and <br>scholarship English, and of course, music  <br>and I absolutely love music. I always have. I've <br>always been a songwriter, but just like Michaela,  <br>I came to Open Day and I went <br>to all the Global Studies  <br>courses and I went to the Science faculty courses <br>and I just couldn't decide what I wanted to do.<br>But then I realised that the only reason why I <br>was thinking about these other options was because  <br>that I wanted a plan B for <br>if my music didn't turn out.  <br>But if I wanted to really succeed <br>in music, I didn't need a plan B.  <br>I couldn't rely on a plan B so I decided <br>to just jump into it and do what I loved.<br>How about you, Matt?<br>Oh yeah, g'day. My name is Matthew Kereama. <br>I went to Rosmini College on the shore,  <br>and back then I studied I think English. I studied <br>physics, calculus. I studied music and drama.<br>And again, like similar stories, I came <br>to university with the intention of doing  <br>engineering because I wanted to be <br>an acoustic engineer for theatres  <br>and I knew that I wanted to work around theatres. <br>Or I was going to do law because I wanted to be  <br>a talent agent and I was just dancing around <br>this idea of actually jumping in the deep end.<br>And I was fortunate enough to get lessons with  <br>Dr Te Oti Rakena before I came to <br>Music and it just stuck in my head.<br>I've just graduated as a Classical <br>Performance in a Bachelor of Music. Yes!<br>So basically, in short, our degree is <br>pretty streamlined as a classical singer.<br>And you do a lot of hours of practice <br>and it's all pretty like routine.<br>So once you jump in, it's kind of a sink or swim, <br>and I was really fortunate enough to like get  <br>that backstroke pretty good, so I was swimming <br>for a while and just three years just flew by.<br>And so I, you know, didn't get my fill,  <br>so I've jumped straight back into <br>honours. And it's really exciting.<br>Opera is one of these things that requires a <br>lot of like brain work. It's very physical.  <br>It dances on a lot of different levels and <br>a lot of different mediums and fields and  <br>stuff so it's always a challenge, but it's again <br>one of those challenges, it's hard to explain.<br>You just sort of, when you <br>nail it and you get it right,  <br>there's just so many endorphins. There's so <br>many things that just rush through you so  <br>I think I got a bit addicted to that <br>feeling and that rush and I just kept going.<br>So in undergrad, I studied a <br>Bachelor of Music and Arts,  <br>and I specialised in composition and psychology.<br>Psychology really was just another interest that <br>I had, but everything was really about music.<br>I would take a theory course, a composition <br>course, and then there's a few electives that  <br>you can take so it could be history, it could <br>be music production. I think as a composition  <br>student I could even do performance papers and <br>so how it would look for me is usually in the  <br>beginning of the week I have theory classes and <br>that also involves a musicianship component where  <br>all the first and second years come together as a <br>choir, and then I'd have my composition lectures.<br>So that's kind of big classes where we <br>just talk about really general things.  <br>It's also an opportunity to show our <br>work in a larger class. Sometimes we'd  <br>even perform our own compositions in class. <br>We'd also have tutorials, as you mentioned.<br>So these are usually maybe two or three people per <br>lecturer, just sitting in the office going through  <br>our compositions, and we get really intensive <br>feedback both from the lecturer and our peers.<br>And at the end of the week, all of <br>the composition students come together  <br>to meet in the composition workshop and <br>this has - we sometimes have guest speakers,  <br>composers from overseas, but also it's a space for <br>composition students to get their works performed  <br>and have them workshopped, so just a chance for  <br>everyone to kind of give feedback and contribute <br>to the understanding of the student's piece, yeah.<br>So the life of a popular music student <br>is quite different from these guys.<br>Just to put it into brief terms, on Monday, we'll <br>have our main songwriting class, which is when we  <br>meet in the Kenneth Myers Centre as a class, and <br>we discuss songwriting elements, and we listen to  <br>new songs that have just <br>been put into the universe,  <br>and then we just we analyse <br>it and we look into it.<br>On Tuesdays, we have our vocal <br>performance or instrument classes.<br>These will be one-on-one classes and they really, <br>really benefit your performance altogether. On  <br>Wednesday, we could have our theory class <br>which is in first and second years, but in  <br>third year we don't have this anymore because <br>we've basically learned all there is to theory.<br>There's a lot to it, but it's just all we need.<br>On Thursdays, we'll have our, we call it <br>'workshops' which is when all the popular  <br>music students of the degree, which is first, <br>second and third year students, come together  <br>and we meet at songwriting, the <br>rooms in Kenneth Myers Centre,  <br>and often this will be an interview with <br>a famous person in the music industry.<br>For instance, we've had Holly Smith come in.  <br>We've had many, many other famous <br>musicians come in and we'll just have  <br>interviews, and we'll sit in the audience <br>with questions, and we'll ask them what it is.<br>Maybe on Friday, we'll then have our <br>production classes which is my favourite.<br>This is also in the Kenneth Myers Centre where <br>we sit around a room full of computers and MIDI  <br>keyboards, and we'll learn about how the <br>music is produced and what we can do to  <br>make the mix even better. So that's the <br>typical week of a popular music student.<br>So, there's a lot of performance opportunities. <br>Obviously being in a performance degree,  <br>we are always performing. I've said <br>"performing" three times, now four.<br>There is basically, so like coming back to the <br>week - on a Monday, usually for a voice class,  <br>but if you're in any instrument performing for <br>classical performance, you get to perform in front  <br>of your classmates first year, second year, third <br>year, fourth year, honours, masters, doctorates.<br>And we basically like watch you perform and <br>it's this cool sort of workshop where you  <br>have your tutor or your lecturer sort <br>of talk you through what you've done.<br>There's immediate feedback and there's a chance to  <br>go back over and do it again. So it's <br>a little bit daunting to begin with,  <br>but after about four years it sort of becomes <br>like just the second thing, it's the norm.<br>A lot of these performances are geared up to be  <br>a representation or like a <br>rehearsal for bigger things.<br>So if you're a voice student, you <br>get to perform in Opera Scenes,  <br>which is a small collective of scenes <br>in operas. It's called 'Opera Scenes'.  <br>And it's an awesome opportunity to put <br>everything you've learned into action.<br>Not many university students get <br>that opportunity as an opera singer.<br>There's also, we do a lot with the <br>Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra.  <br>We go to St Matthew's and perform outside of the <br>music theatre itself sometimes if we're lucky.<br>And yeah, I mean, there's always <br>a hot demand for musicians  <br>and there's always the sort of ask and demand and <br>the opportunity to perform as a university student  <br>is actually like something that's quite rewarding,  <br>and it's something that you can really look <br>forward to and prepare for so... there's hundreds.<br>Even in theory class, if <br>you're doing like MUS 100,  <br>you get to basically practice in a choir, a <br>chamber choir and you'll practice as a part  <br>of your course, as a part of your paper and <br>at the end of that semester, you'll perform.<br>But also, as part of the degree, we have our final <br>performances every semester. These are a big deal  <br>and they're at the Kenneth Myers <br>Centre at the end of every semester.  <br>It will be around this time of the semester, which <br>is towards the end of the semester every year,  <br>and we basically go on stage and we perform two <br>songs that we've written that semester. We have  <br>a full band and this is an amazing opportunity <br>to meet people who are outside your degree.<br>For instance, I've got a band <br>consisting of a jazz bassist,  <br>a classical pianist, a producer drummer <br>and also a composition major guitarist.<br>So these people all consist of <br>people I've just met, you know,  <br>walking on the street or going <br>to events and it's really cool  <br>meeting people from outside your degree to <br>perform with at the end of the semester.<br>I came through university on the <br>Māori Academic Excellence Scholarship.<br>I was very fortunate.<br>I was very privileged to go <br>through with that scholarship.<br>Scholarships are a cool and fun thing in <br>the sense that they can help you out a lot  <br>and it's worth applying.<br>A bit like a lotto ticket, you need to <br>apply to be in the running for them.<br>There's hundreds of scholarships.  <br>Music has probably the most scholarships <br>with involved with the University itself.<br>CAI (Creative Arts and Industries) <br>and the Music department  <br>as well. So it's just important to <br>apply. I'm pretty sure if you apply  <br>for like the big ones then you <br>automatically are applied for other things.<br>My biggest tip for scholarships is, you know, <br>go through and look for as many as you can,  <br>both inside the University and outside. But also, <br>if you can look ahead if you're in year 12 or if  <br>you've just started year 13, have a quick look <br>at scholarships just at the start of the year.<br>There are always some little things <br>that pop up and you go, oh you know,  <br>like have you coached a sports team? Or have <br>you been a part of a choir? Or have you done  <br>these things that you might not think about? And <br>they're looking for like certain types of people  <br>so it's nice to get those things under your belt <br>with a little bit of foresight into that area.<br>That'd be my biggest tip and <br>just apply, apply, apply, apply.<br>Some people get quite internal, thinking, "I'll <br>never get it so there's no point," but you never  <br>know, and you never know what scholarships <br>are down the line. Any sort of help helps,  <br>and it's nice to be welcomed and accepted.<br>So, to get into university there are a <br>couple steps you need to do beforehand.  <br>Some of the degrees require additional <br>applications in order for you to get  <br>into university, whether that's a <br>written statement or an audition.<br>For me, specifically for <br>the popular music program,  <br>I had to submit an online video of <br>me performing my own original music  <br>so it was really easy to do this. <br>I just did it in my own music room.<br>My sister came in with an iPad  <br>and she just filmed me performing two <br>songs that I've written that year.<br>It's really easy because I know some of <br>these students in my class actually had  <br>to write their first original pieces for <br>this audition in order to get into uni.<br>So it's more about just showcasing that <br>you can indeed songwrite and that you can  <br>develop these techniques later <br>on after you get into university.<br>But it's all very easy. You just <br>look on the University website.<br>It's all very informational. You can <br>seek help through emails if you need.  <br>There's help wherever you go and <br>if you need it, it will be there.<br>Yeah, so at school I wasn't the <br>best theory person there was.<br>I knew the basics, you know, like <br>the crotchets and I could read  <br>simple scores and stuff like that and <br>I got through it, you know. We had to.<br>So when I came into university on that, like <br>that first paper, MUSE 100, it was actually  <br>really refreshing. We started at the bare minimum <br>basics: what is a crotchet? What is the semibreve?  <br>You know, these are staves, these <br>are the notes, the circle of fifths.<br>And I mean, a large part of that course <br>is also like the history of music,  <br>so you start with like where it came from <br>and where theory comes from the Gregorian  <br>chants and the first monks that like put a <br>note on a stave, and you do really quickly  <br>realise that it is a language, and it's an <br>international language that we can all speak.<br>And it's exponential.<br>That course moves so quick and then <br>out of nowhere you're suddenly like  <br>right where you need to be, and then <br>it kicks off again for, you know,  <br>for the next semester. Where you jump in and <br>then you're quickly learning about harmonisation,  <br>four-part harmony, and then it <br>goes even further to counterpoint.<br>And again, so I'm a classical singer <br>and I'm stereotypical and like,  <br>"I'll never need to know this," but <br>until you start to get to this level  <br>where suddenly you're picking up orchestral <br>scores and you need to know exactly where you are  <br>and it just becomes like second nature, you <br>just pick up a score and just start reading it.<br>I would have never thought... My <br>music teachers would laugh at me now  <br>because I would have never thought I would have <br>got there. But I did and so it's pretty cool.<br>In undergrad composition, my <br>lecturers are experts in their field.<br>So we have choral experts, orchestral experts - <br>they write for the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra,  <br>for chamber ensembles overseas, and it's really <br>inspiring to see the path that you can take  <br>as a composer, and just to have these <br>role models that you can look up to.<br>And once you get to postgraduate, you've kind <br>of had a chance to be taught by these different  <br>lecturers, and in postgrad you can choose your <br>supervisor, choose what approach you want to take.<br>If you want to focus on choral music, then  <br>Leonie Holmes is great for that. If you want <br>to focus on contemporary classical music,  <br>there's lots of options, lots of lecturers <br>who are keen to be involved in that.<br>Yeah, what about you Dani?<br>I actually have a really good experience <br>with my teachers and lecturers.  <br>They are actually one of the sources <br>of inspiration for me at university.<br>For instance, our main course coordinators,  <br>which is Stephen and Godfrey, <br>they're absolutely amazing.<br>For instance, Godfrey was my inspiration, <br>because he used to teach me one-on-one piano,  <br>to basically look into all the weird and <br>funky chords that I can use for songwriting,  <br>and he basically inspired me to go beyond my <br>songwriting chord progression capabilities  <br>in order to develop more as a songwriter.<br>He's also written music for people like Che Fu,  <br>as well as Kanye West so I think <br>that's pretty cool to boast about.<br>Yeah, our lecturers are absolutely amazing.<br>Our producer teacher Jason is also amazing. <br>He's taught me so much about producing!  <br>I'm now so passionate about it, which is a <br>huge step going from first-year —not knowing  <br>anything— to basically mastering my own music now, <br>which is like the final step of music production.<br>How about you?<br>Yeah, so with any of the performance majors <br>specifically, and like any instrument,  <br>you sort of get paired up with a mentor <br>and it becomes very much like the master  <br>and the apprentice-style where you spend <br>a lot of time one-on-one with the person.<br>So, my teacher is Dr Te Oti Rakena, and it's <br>been, like it's almost daunting looking at his CV.<br>He's performed internationally, he's been all <br>over the place. And they are performers — and  <br>I say "they are" because there is a core group <br>surrounding your instrument, your specialty.<br>And although you might have one teacher <br>on every Monday, for singers, we have a  <br>master class where they rotate through the other <br>teachers like Morag Atchison, Catrin Johnsson,  <br>Robert Wiremu, who are all amazing in <br>their own right and are again performers.<br>There's been numerous times that they've come in <br>jet-lagged from performing overseas and having  <br>to do a class with us which is awesome. <br>And they also have amazing friends that  <br>would come in. But it's - so again, you get <br>this really personal experience one-on-one,  <br>but then you also get like a <br>lot of different, you know,  <br>colours and advice from all the other <br>tutors and lecturers in that course.<br>And the only other thing I'll mention is: it's not <br>competitive. I think there can be that - sometimes  <br>people think, "I'm with this person and they're <br>with that person," but if you're like doing  <br>something and it needs a certain flair or a <br>certain angle and that lecturer can give it,  <br>absolutely, you know, have a lesson with them, <br>see what you can do, book in in the office hours.<br>And it's really cool that sort of <br>collaborative process, both internally with us  <br>as students, and the lecturers themselves.<br>So, why the University of Auckland?<br>For me, it came down to  <br>the lecturers themselves. I knew them <br>personally, they were an awesome group.<br>And especially with something that's <br>so specialised, like voice or like any  <br>instrument, it really does come down to that <br>one-on-one connection between the people here.<br>And building that relationship,  <br>being from Auckland to the University of <br>Auckland was a big reason why I wanted to go.<br>And I did - I mean, I looked at, <br>you know, Wellington and Otago, and  <br>it just came down to like that personal <br>preference and that personal flair.<br>The other big reason is that it is Auckland, and  <br>especially when it comes to the <br>arts, it's sort of like a hub.<br>A lot of theatre comes through here. A lot of the  <br>music — big international <br>projects come through here.<br>A lot of things are rehearsed in <br>Auckland and then travel the country.  <br>So you're really close to the source <br>and there's a lot of connections and  <br>especially for us here, it's really easy for <br>people to sort of come in and talk to us,  <br>and we do get a lot of international people <br>just coming in, just on their day off.<br>And that's really exciting.<br>So, that's mainly the reasons why I came here.<br>And then again, the reason why I <br>stayed was because of the people, and  <br>it was awesome to have these connections, <br>these friendships, and that lasted like  <br>not only here, but outside of the University.<br>Because, again, they were working in <br>Auckland, they were working around  <br>um before they jet-setted off, so yeah.<br>For me, one thing that drew me to the <br>University of Auckland was the facilities.  <br>So we've got computer labs <br>specifically for composition.<br>It's got heaps of software on it. There's <br>recording equipment that you can rent out,  <br>recording studios, practice rooms.  <br>And then with all of that, there's also the <br>flexibility within the programme itself.<br>So as a composer, I did all of the <br>music production papers in undergrad and  <br>I ended up running a recording project at <br>uni, helping students record their works and  <br>it just brought composers, performers, producers <br>together, and it was just a great collaboration.<br>So I think, yeah, it's the people.<br>It's the people you meet and the connections <br>you make and the ones that last, definitely.<br>Just going off that, I totally <br>agree with both of you.<br>It is definitely the people that make the place. <br>For instance, I'm from Wellington, my family's in  <br>Wellington, and I decided to come up for the <br>University of Auckland and I stayed in halls  <br>for my first, second, and third year. This is my <br>third year now. I'm an RA. So for me, I believe  <br>that music is one of the most important things <br>when it comes to opportunity. You need to be in  <br>a city that thrives off energy and I personally <br>need that opportunity around me for me to thrive.<br>So I need to see things going on. I need to <br>see people that can take me to a higher level.<br>I need to have connections made  <br>in my time at university for me to build a <br>foundation to work off when I'm finished at uni.<br>So for me, Auckland is the biggest <br>and most vibrant city in New Zealand  <br>and I believe that it creates the most <br>opportunities in order for me to develop  <br>to my best and most capable <br>self as a singer-songwriter.<br>So, being in Auckland means that <br>I can go to all the concerts that  <br>maybe wouldn't have gone to <br>any other city in New Zealand.<br>I would get to meet people who <br>are international who may not  <br>have time to travel to other areas in New Zealand.<br>It just means that I'm in the hot spot <br>of the country and it means that I can  <br>basically see the opportunities <br>as they come out, essentially.<br>Life after the university <br>can be very, very daunting.<br>It's very scary for anybody and <br>especially in your first year,  <br>you just don't know where <br>you're going, you don't know,  <br>you don't want to finish university just because <br>you're terrified of what's going on afterwards.<br>But in my third year, I can see the light <br>at the end of the tunnel. I know various  <br>students that have come out of this degree <br>and are now making a living with their music.<br>Some artists you may know of is Foley, Navvy,  <br>and more students like that who are <br>basically in the pop industry now.<br>I also have a classmate who's currently <br>an intern for a big music supervisor who  <br>actually does music for a lot of Tarantino films <br>so that's a huge step to work towards a goal.<br>And for me personally, I want to do an internship <br>after graduating or go on to do a masters  <br>in production, so basically look into the <br>production and recording side of things.<br>So there is many, many opportunities for <br>life after university, and I can name  <br>many, many names that have gone to make <br>incredible things out of their degree.<br>So like, singing, when you get to a certain <br>level and you've matured in your voices there,  <br>you know, the sky is... what's <br>the phrase? The sky's the limit!<br>And I've had personal friends <br>go on to perform at the Met,  <br>to perform at San Francisco, <br>Sydney Opera House, you name it.<br>Alumni of this university have gone <br>through in some capacity or another.<br>And again, like it's just cool to be <br>a singer and as you guys are talking,  <br>I remember how much we collab with composers for <br>things that then go on to do international things.<br>And I was a part of an early composition for <br>a composer who took their work all the way  <br>through England, and that was just a cool <br>thing to just be like a young uni student,  <br>just testing out if the <br>baritone could sing that low.<br>But yeah, so it's awesome to have those people <br>come back and to shout you a beer at Shadows  <br>and just like chat about San Francisco <br>and Wales — if you've heard of SOL3 MIO,  <br>they're like the pinnacle of what we've <br>got coming out at the moment, so yeah.<br>My biggest tip for university students, in <br>their first year especially, is to just expand  <br>your bubble as much as possible and to dabble <br>as many passions and interests as you have.<br>So for me, I have a lot of different hobbies <br>and a lot of the different things that I go for  <br>and clubs is the best opportunity for you to <br>do that. You can join, obviously definitely  <br>over-commit, because you're definitely going <br>to over-commit in your first year with clubs,  <br>but that's a good thing because then you meet <br>more people, then you get more opportunities,  <br>then you get to do things maybe once or <br>twice and then decide you don't like it.<br>So my probably biggest advice that I have <br>is to try and do as much as possible that  <br>makes your heart happy and that <br>makes your life interesting  <br>so that you can meet more people that you'll <br>see in weird circumstances in the future.<br>Like, the world is small. Sometimes you <br>walk down the street and then bump into,  <br>you know, a paintball friend <br>and then turns out they're  <br>like this big music producer that <br>can help you with your next single.<br>Just dabble in as many things as you can.<br>My advice is to just get stuck in and be open <br>to all the opportunities that come your way.  <br>I think it's really important <br>to just have that energy  <br>from day one because you never know <br>what opportunities might arise.<br>And as Dani said, clubs are so fun. You know, <br>you can be a composer, but you can still do  <br>fencing, you can be in a board games club. <br>Like me, you can watch anime, and you can  <br>just do whatever you want because everything <br>is here for you to broaden your experience.<br>I think my number one tip would be: go <br>up and shake the hand of your lecturer.  <br>It can be kind of daunting if you sit in <br>these big theatres and you're way up the back  <br>and they're these person that just show you <br>slides. But they do care. They want you to pass.<br>They are your friends. They're incredibly nice.<br>And especially in Music, we've got this unique <br>circumstance where we're quite a small cohort  <br>and so you do get to know these <br>people really well and it's just  <br>really nice to have that one-on-one connection <br>with your lecturer. It helps you turn up.  <br>You know, it helps you have like a friend <br>that's the person that's helping you out.<br>So yeah, that would be my biggest tip is, <br>you know, shake their hand on the way in,  <br>say goodbye to them on the way out. <br>Feel free to use their office hours.  <br>Email them if you have a question. Get them <br>on your side because in university you're  <br>surrounded by people it's a big moving machine <br>sometimes and it's nice to have a friend.<br>So yeah, that's me and I <br>hope to see you next year.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
