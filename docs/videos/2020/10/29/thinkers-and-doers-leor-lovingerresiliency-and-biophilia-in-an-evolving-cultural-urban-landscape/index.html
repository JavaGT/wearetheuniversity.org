the<br>technicon<br>haifa israel and a master's degree in<br>landscape architecture from the<br>university of california<br>berkeley his lecture titled resiliency<br>and biophilia in an evolving cultural<br>and urban landscape<br>looks at the human need to connect to<br>nature and other forms of life<br>for our own health and well-being<br>especially in the current situation of<br>highly urbanized<br>and dense cities as well as the<br>intensity of life<br>associated with such pressures like the<br>current outcomes of covert 19.<br>climate change and its related<br>challenges especially with israel<br>required to consider how to develop and<br>most importantly how the naturally built<br>environment can be adapted<br>to the increasing threats of<br>desertification and flooding<br>over the past decades leor's work has<br>focused on how to turn water from a risk<br>to an opportunity and how to apply water<br>as a medium to engage and enhance nature<br>that by applying water conscious design<br>in a semi-arid environment<br>we may learn not only to live with water<br>but to thrive with water and how this<br>approach<br>encourages new developments to be<br>resilient sustainable<br>and and have attractive environments<br>in this lecture we are will share from<br>his studio's experience<br>in nature inclusive designing as a<br>strategy to address<br>climate change and enhance bio failure<br>just some very quickly uh housekeeping<br>rules don't forget italia<br>uh will be sharing uh the screen so keep<br>this video open he's already sharing as<br>you<br>probably can see also i would appreciate<br>if you remind me to throughout the talk<br>and at the end there will be plenty of<br>time for opportunity<br>for questions either verbally or written<br>through the chat box and without food<br>you<br>please joining me join me in welcoming<br>and leor all the way from tel aviv<br>israel<br>thank you very much um bruno it's first<br>of all thank you very much for the<br>invitation and the pleasure and honor<br>and um i've been running through the<br>faces on the screen and um<br>a lot of colleagues from europe and and<br>from<br>um i think that um<br>one of the things that i did towards<br>this talk is um<br>quite a thing you know here in israel<br>we're in a lockdown now during the um<br>19 crisis that we're all experiencing<br>and um one of the things that it brought<br>to the front is this<br>it further enhanced<br>this uh this dialogue and talk about our<br>need to engage<br>nature our work<br>and i think the base of our practice<br>really talks about water<br>especially in our region which is a<br>scarce<br>matter and we have to occasionally deal<br>with both the lack of water<br>severe in israel over the past years<br>because of major development<br>and i think that at the base of the talk<br>before<br>i just started i wanted to say that um<br>my education is very quickly which was<br>very much environmentally focused long<br>before the crisis<br>of climate change<br>and um and also the work i've had the<br>great uh i'd say much luck and and<br>pleasure to work in<br>in great offices with some of the iconic<br>masters of landscape architecture and<br>they've<br>definitely influenced my approach so um<br>the first image of my talk<br>is my uh the nature of my<br>landscape of my childhood i grew i was<br>born in montreal<br>and um you know and and this hill i got<br>to run on it about three years ago in<br>the uh<br>in the world uh design conference<br>and and this idea of how humans<br>connections with nature and other forms<br>that's that goes<br>way back and even if we go just 150<br>years back to central park and the ideas<br>of central park<br>uh especially as we perceive it as an<br>icon of nature with these uh<br>blue stone outcrops and um<br>these are my kids on these outcrops when<br>we lived in new york<br>but one of the things and there was this<br>uh amazing<br>slide that i saw in the lecture when i<br>was in new york this is uh<br>later i borrowed it from stan allen<br>which really talks about the<br>construction of central park and what we<br>perceive as this icon of nature<br>is basically uh man constructed<br>and you know the the um information is<br>stunning you know 10 million barrels of<br>rock and poor soil were removed<br>uh 14 thousand cubic meters of soil were<br>brought from new jersey and four million<br>trees were planted<br>and um and in israel we also had<br>examples<br>um also my former boss israel prize<br>winner dan soup<br>in northern israel and when we talk<br>about the middle east<br>in general um especially we have a lot<br>of<br>european designers coming to israel to<br>work everybody perceives this as this<br>mediterranean landscape with its palette<br>of plants<br>and there's an image associated with<br>that but when we look at tel aviv for<br>instance and we look at the urban areas<br>it's quite harsh we see that the<br>urbanism<br>the intensity at which we develop our<br>cities<br>is telling the way we look we look at<br>landscape<br>and it raises questions of how<br>can we as landscape architects address<br>the urban landscape<br>in a manner that is powerful enough<br>that has enough meaning in it both to<br>address our needs for nature and living<br>one of the things when we look at<br>examples and i think that burley marks<br>um his work is best appreciated because<br>he was like the landscape architect that<br>worked<br>um with uh with this brutalist that we<br>all know of course the<br>niemeyer and the fact that he<br>took the icons and the<br>ideas of the amazon forest into<br>buildings and into the landscape<br>as inspiration i mean he had to<br>um intervene in a manner that was<br>powerful enough to work with neymar's<br>work and<br>we can go to halperin's work and how he<br>brought the ideas of the sierra<br>into his work and and that of that<br>actually helps soften<br>uh modernist approach so when we're<br>looking the brutality which our cities<br>are<br>developed today with very much with uh<br>developer uh<br>um developer-led um<br>then that is one one aspect to look at<br>and also<br>my former employer and definitely<br>one of the offices that had great<br>influence on my thinking is<br>the officer michael van volkenberg who<br>looked at all these blue<br>blue stone outcrops of the north uh<br>north and eastern hemisphere<br>in northern america and and how they<br>inspire these nature based<br>uh parks and how they address nature<br>so when i uh first project i want to<br>talk about<br>really in sense it talks about uh<br>i would say something like a seven or<br>eight year process<br>um our office uh process because<br>marine biologists we submitted a<br>competition<br>uh one of the most important<br>competitions in the ocean<br>um in 2011 the savannah ocean exchange<br>and we came in second<br>second place and um he's marine by<br>biologist<br>from tel aviv university they were phds<br>at the time now they have a practice<br>we're developing different matrices of<br>concrete because most of the developing<br>world along coast is with concrete and<br>then we're looking at an<br>ecologically sustainable manner of<br>developing coastal<br>areas and i gave a lecture at the<br>university i was talking about my<br>experience at valkenberg's office and<br>um and then we after this competition<br>i basically got exposed to their work<br>and some of it was how they were testing<br>different composites of concrete<br>changing um um the basics of the<br>concrete for instance instead of um<br>then they were using quartz and<br>integrating uh volcanic rock<br>to give it more porosity and that<br>together with investigation of<br>complexity of surfaces<br>showed that the recruitment the<br>recruitment of of nature within the uh<br>within the ocean<br>depended on both uh uh<br>more intelligent matrices of concrete<br>and uh<br>and complexity and on the<br>lower images in this slide you can see<br>um<br>that the research was showing very much<br>success in the ocean and through our<br>discussions sometimes i'm coffee<br>sometimes online<br>um i was wondering what we can do within<br>the landscape that is above water the<br>onshore<br>landscapes and i got back to berlin<br>marks who for me is<br>also very influential person in my in my<br>work<br>and um and his gardens and uh country<br>wall and uh guardians<br>and i started questioning what could be<br>on the lower right screen you can see<br>this 30 by 30 centimeter<br>concrete composition and part of it was<br>trying to see how plants can grow<br>along this and and because it is porous<br>because each tile<br>the way it's um poured and composite you<br>can basically dip it in a<br>in a in in water<br>and after it finishes in finishes to<br>drip<br>it holds a half a liter or 500<br>milliliters of water<br>so we were looking at something that<br>basically can can<br>help induce planting we found one of our<br>guardians we were doing at the time this<br>is uh on a<br>fifth floor of a roof a building and we<br>took this<br>uh 90 centimeters wide wall and six<br>meters tall and we did the first pilot<br>of this bioactive<br>tile and later<br>our office uh was part of the<br>competition for the controller building<br>in israel<br>in jerusalem and as part of that the<br>archive was supposed to be in a lowered<br>garden a lower walled garden<br>we had this idea that this bioactive<br>tile could be like the wallpaper for<br>this garden<br>and so this very um harsh environment<br>could be<br>could be a very uh an enclosed garden<br>and eventually we we um together with<br>the developer together with the<br>architects called garage then we<br>won this competition and this became a<br>reality<br>and this is the first time we engaged in<br>a project and<br>scientists thought that we could take<br>this further and they started developing<br>these pockets<br>we kept this dialogue going on and then<br>we had an urban project in tel aviv<br>we call this project the urban oasis<br>it's one of um<br>tel aviv's um leading architects<br>it's a very um challenging corner that<br>the building is addressing and um the<br>space itself<br>you can see this is the view up looking<br>from the court<br>sort of an enclosed court with an open<br>opening to the south<br>um and it brought in again this idea<br>if i go back to the earlier slides i<br>showed up how in a very<br>complex urban dense unstructured<br>building how can we bring a nature into<br>this<br>garden when we look at the plan it's um<br>it's all commercial activity on the<br>exterior very much like a european<br>complex where you<br>enter and then there are three cores<br>this is about 70 apartments<br>and in the garden is then this entry<br>garden that connects<br>has a social factor within this building<br>but also<br>sort of an entry from the intensive<br>life and then on the southern side it<br>opens up and you can really bring in the<br>mediterranean palate<br>to some degree because we're using<br>recycled water and that's another part<br>of how i look at landscape that<br>to bring the native landscape is very<br>hard to hold<br>in a shaded uh vicinity with tel aviv<br>growing<br>at a pace that will look like new york<br>in about 20 years<br>with towers of 30 30 and 40 stories we<br>have to<br>finding means you know pantos would<br>never be related to as an israeli plant<br>neither would um<br>la gastemia but we have other plants<br>that are very much the mediterranean<br>pelican herbs but when we look in the<br>internal court<br>so because of the commercial activities<br>on the exterior<br>we got a almost like a five store a five<br>meter<br>um tall wall that runs the entire length<br>of the court and then<br>we developed with the scientist pockets<br>that was another way to take this<br>further this is<br>another few views of that of that site<br>and how it looks at night and i'd say<br>the client<br>was very forward thinking and the<br>approach to the building is sustainable<br>and all the<br>apartments have the same air<br>conditioning and all the water is<br>collected all the water is recycled<br>so we can really look at a pallet that<br>maybe has the need for more water<br>and it's it's a mediterranean enhanced<br>pallet of planting<br>that combines both the shading that we<br>needed or plants that can address the<br>shedding but also um<br>also um the mediterranean palliative we<br>wanna we wanna feel our native culture<br>even when we're in these challenging<br>environments um also very complex<br>watering systems we have very good<br>consultants to valedino works with us on<br>other things and and you can see the<br>recruitment of biology and all of these<br>and<br>this has been an open laboratory um<br>and uh it's been growing mosses and<br>legends and climbing vegetation<br>and um we've they've also be the<br>scientists and we've been working them<br>on on<br>research within the court because what<br>happens with its wall like we want to go<br>back<br>one or two slides here so there's a drip<br>line at the top of this wall that<br>works in the morning so this drip line<br>wets the wall<br>and so these tiles that can hold a half<br>liter of water basically<br>capture the water and then it's supposed<br>to induce the planting to grow on it<br>so when i look at i'm going back so it's<br>also serving as a cooling block<br>and so they they measure the<br>temperatures on a hot day both within<br>the courtyard and without and<br>out the courtyard on the street and we<br>find differences the delta is anywhere<br>between 2 to 13 degrees<br>so when we talk about climate resilience<br>we can really this is we call this a<br>self-sustained oasis because<br>the users of these air conditions are<br>basically creating the water that's<br>feeding this guardian that's<br>that's cooling the block that's cooling<br>the court it's giving this um<br>very temporary client and a pleasant<br>place for the people to gather<br>and we've also planted a different uh<br>type of plants and we've been monitoring<br>it to see what<br>uh succeeds and we hosted a group from<br>italy<br>a couple of years back and and with the<br>this bird which we call in hebrew has a<br>hebrew name atoll is one of<br>the birds that's disappearing from our<br>landscape and so<br>uh there's something very iconic that<br>what we developed with the marine<br>biologist<br>the ocean became became a nest and so<br>this whole connection with nature<br>had more meaning especially with this uh<br>group that visited it was a<br>was a great moment um and the urban<br>environment just one more one more<br>example before we stretch out to the<br>agricultural and rural areas<br>this is a map of tel aviv we can see the<br>the port of tel aviv<br>um for those uh a bit more familiar<br>rabin rabin square that were the prime<br>minister that was the assassin<br>um tel aviv is a very dense area um<br>it was uh developed by a scottish<br>planner and we have<br>we have beautiful boulevards throughout<br>the city<br>and this side on the background of the<br>open<br>areas this is a eight hectare or eddie<br>dunham's<br>site with 14 towers and what we try to<br>show here<br>to our client into the city of tel aviv<br>is that there is a lack of<br>public space in this area we saw that in<br>that first image that there's always<br>more the more need for as we become more<br>dense in our cities<br>need for open space and so we try to<br>bring an image or an icon of something<br>that is off created<br>something that works opposite to the 14<br>buildings and the city grid<br>and based on early planning it has four<br>major entries and<br>and um once you walk in through here<br>um you're suddenly in a different<br>environment this is a two hectare park<br>it's like 20 dunams and um and some<br>some images of that park which also<br>manages storm water<br>and and just to show i think i left in<br>here an image<br>just this is from michael van volkerberg<br>this is a teardrop park<br>i moved to new york and i joined the<br>office when this was in the last phase<br>of construction and they actually helped<br>with some of the minor details of the<br>second phase<br>but i mean how to build an urban complex<br>in new york<br>and just when you step out of the<br>building to be innate and engaged in<br>nature is something that i think<br>was fascinating and is fascinating about<br>the work of<br>alkenbergen i think that how we look at<br>playgrounds<br>um you know we're not constructing them<br>in this project<br>the typical way that one would construct<br>them and this is<br>another one of my mentors halperin<br>um and this is um stern grove theater in<br>san francisco then i also got to work on<br>some other deals i didn't manage the<br>project but i worked on it is<br>as one of the staff and this is uh you<br>know a performance of his<br>his uh wife's uh anna halperin who's<br>more than 100 years old these days and<br>wish her best of health<br>but but as an inspiration of how to<br>really look at<br>the gathering areas and the nature<br>within this enclosed block of<br>two uh two hectares and uh at the moment<br>this project is in construction<br>we're starting to see the scale of it<br>this is this is the park itself<br>most of the buildings or all of them are<br>on structure<br>and we're looking at the detailing of<br>that as as we speak<br>um the next project<br>i will talk about is the mandel um<br>living roof which project we completed<br>recently in jerusalem<br>this map is the um basically the<br>plan nature master plan uh or open space<br>master plan of jerusalem<br>and one of the things we wanted to show<br>is that through these valleys that<br>our building sits on on the extension of<br>one of these valleys and all of them are<br>basically as you can imagine<br>all of us speaking the same language um<br>we're talking about um we're talking<br>about<br>uh ecological corridors so when this<br>within this valley<br>the building is sitting it's right near<br>the botanic<br>burden<br>um and the building um was designed by<br>um<br>michael mckinnon who who passed this<br>year um<br>he got ill with kovalev 19 and passed so<br>he um he passed two months before the<br>building was dedicated<br>which is sad uh the local architects<br>the local architect is randy epstein and<br>the building itself<br>has a 2 300 square meters<br>and when we wanted to basically look at<br>the<br>the valley and how it runs through it's<br>an area that's going through<br>construction<br>um we wanted to um<br>we wanted to allow for this quarter to<br>pass in<br>and we explored the idea of a living<br>roof<br>this is and to do a living roof at that<br>scale is basically the largest it's the<br>largest living roof in the middle east<br>so we've been told we approached the<br>director<br>of uh the nature director of the um um<br>environmental protection agency uh mr<br>balaban<br>who is very much<br>i think um very unique in israel in the<br>fact that he represents the nature<br>uh authority um protection agency but<br>but um but he thinks<br>of how to best work with development<br>and without compromising i'd say and so<br>what we what you do on a living roof is<br>you basically peel off the land from one<br>of these mountains a lot of the areas<br>that are going through construction you<br>basically take off terrarosa soil<br>and you put it on a roof and this<br>example for the project they did in<br>jerusalem<br>and you can see it's a seasonal issue<br>because there's no watering there's no<br>it's not it's not um<br>it's not uh it's not watered it's not<br>domesticated it's it's natural in<br>essence when you bring the soil you<br>bring the natural seeds with it in the<br>natural plants<br>and it's a very sustainable manner and<br>obviously when you think of our culture<br>when you have a roof like that then<br>you're air conditioning less<br>um and so we decided to do that but when<br>we decided to do it the building was<br>already planned so the structure<br>couldn't hold<br>as much soil as we wanted so we ended up<br>with what we what we would<br>um define um in a regular terms an<br>extensive roof which means it can't hold<br>much soil<br>and this is the also was sort of a<br>state-of-the-art approach to try in our<br>climate<br>to work with 10 to 20 centimeters on the<br>roof<br>and to enhance it with logical structure<br>to the rocks and the recycled from<br>branches and<br>decaying tree trunks and um<br>and then we planted the roof with<br>over 15 000 seeds and plants genophytes<br>and then<br>seeds and annuals and also um sedums<br>and this is the planting plan and um one<br>of the things i've learned<br>through the work i've got to do in these<br>amazing offices that i've had the<br>opportunity to work with green roofs<br>is that even within a roof you can have<br>several micro climates and<br>my approach to green roofs is is very<br>darwinistic<br>in other words you create something that<br>looks like a jackson pollock uh draw<br>uh painting and you let nature do its<br>thing and in some areas<br>one plant you know the sedums will be<br>the<br>dominating and in others the geophytes<br>and sometimes<br>even within a small distance just<br>because of the sun exposure the soil<br>humidity you can different uh different<br>types so this is the roof and obviously<br>to<br>to plant this roof with that crazy plan<br>we had to<br>set out a grid and i'm just showing<br>briefly because it's such a simple roof<br>a living roof and<br>i must say that when we do these<br>projects the idea is to take a public<br>building<br>and say well if we can do this in<br>jerusalem we can do it in the heart of<br>the big we can do it anywhere so the<br>idea of thinking<br>of these very simple sustainable roofs<br>with native plants<br>as um as an icon and as an example of<br>how to develop<br>public buildings that was one of the<br>major<br>goals that we for ourselves so this is<br>the roof and<br>just a regular any one that did a green<br>roof<br>is exactly what we're looking at with<br>the drainage<br>and um and then just bringing the soil<br>and these these are sites that are<br>supposed to be excavated for public<br>buildings<br>that are all covered and the material is<br>spread<br>um and we've brought sea swells which<br>i'll show you in a minute wherever it is<br>i know this plant it's quite amazing<br>sits on the ground and then goes up to<br>about a meter and a half<br>tall and we put two thousand of those on<br>the roof and um<br>you know one of the things just with an<br>ecological park<br>it takes a year two three years to the<br>biology<br>and ecology to develop but also one of<br>the things<br>is that there's a there's a a regular<br>um gardener that won this project you<br>know the<br>the construction company there used to<br>do regular guardians<br>so we had to teach them how to plant<br>these geophytes and seeds and we've been<br>there<br>um very much almost every day<br>working with them on these plantings and<br>we also had to meet with a client and<br>tell them how they're going to maintain<br>this roof<br>and how to maintain a roof like these<br>are systems<br>collected from the hills of jerusalem<br>also from sites that are<br>supposed to be um excavated and worked<br>so<br>we're saving these plants and we're<br>keeping them in jerusalem and living<br>and for those of you that are less<br>familiar with students each of these<br>spikes coming out are basically plugs so<br>each of them<br>we separate from by hand and we plant<br>them on the roof<br>even though the site work even though<br>the cyborg um<br>was even though the site work was<br>running a bit<br>behind the roof was given a priority so<br>we can finish the planting just before<br>the first reign of october this was<br>a year ago and these are the first<br>rains and the roof can hold<br>450 cubic meters of water which is<br>another issue that we wanted to<br>show as an example to people in in the<br>region and<br>in our administration in the jerusalem<br>uh planning authority<br>um is the role of the environment and<br>how this roof can<br>okay we're going to we're going to beat<br>the beat technology eventually<br>so this this uh coming back i don't know<br>i hope i wasn't cut off too early<br>um i was talking about this roof that<br>we advanced the work on it even though<br>the site work wasn't finished<br>and this is the first uh first images of<br>uh of spring coming up the first seats<br>and you know we start finding all these<br>different it's like um<br>psi in new york you find all kinds of<br>bones and stuff on the roof so you know<br>the<br>all kinds of crows and other birds are<br>bringing stuff to the site<br>and these these are the first planting<br>the first flowerings of the<br>sea squirrels about a month and a half<br>ago<br>um bruno can you hear well is everything<br>okay with the connection yeah<br>everything is okay now okay so<br>i'm moving on to the next yeah i'm<br>moving to the next project<br>and um one of the issues that um<br>also i feel we're very lucky to have in<br>our office we we<br>for our stay we're we're uh we we choose<br>very complex<br>and problematic projects that nobody<br>wants to take<br>and we work on them for six seven eight<br>years and eventually<br>fight long enough and find the right<br>people to team up with<br>so this project something that i<br>i'm very proud to be part of um and<br>what we're looking at is a nature park<br>in the heart of israel it's located<br>somewhere between tel aviv and<br>haifa about half an hour from a<br>drive from tel aviv half an hour from<br>haifa and one of the things that um<br>in israel because of the africa's great<br>rift<br>um<br>it's a majority route for birds<br>and so when there's water in our country<br>um<br>it's very it has a major influence on<br>the landscape and on nature<br>and um as a valley<br>it's the agricultural valley of israel i<br>think about 90<br>of the cucumbers are grown in this<br>valley in our country<br>and um and it's also um<br>in terms of um wetlands and<br>habitats there are a lot of body<br>reservoirs there's 46 percent of the<br>land use here<br>um basically is uh aquatic habits<br>and this site was a<br>site that was fishing pools an<br>agricultural use that is not very<br>economic these days and the pools were<br>neglected because of<br>they were just not economic and a<br>sufficient start<br>process started and then there was a<br>battle between the<br>um green agencies and environmental<br>agencies to the<br>agricultural agencies that went into a<br>water reservoir for the agricultural<br>flight around eventually um<br>gratefully they gave this land to the to<br>the friend to the country as a<br>sort of a gift for 50 years<br>and and then this move forward as<br>a part and we work with ecologists and<br>with other partners<br>it was a very long process and um you<br>know<br>short shorts long story short we did all<br>this research on these different pools<br>each one had different ecological values<br>um the great things working with uh with<br>ecologists<br>is that we know that when we look at<br>different levels<br>of the water we're talking about<br>different habitats for birds<br>and when we look at the pools and we<br>know that water usually<br>when a pool fills it's the same site we<br>on the dry season we<br>we did some excavation here on the<br>bottom of these pools<br>so there are different levels of water<br>and<br>this site already had some activity<br>since we completed it<br>and we completed we did the design these<br>are the<br>uh bird watching uh buildings that we<br>also designed in-house<br>and for those of you who still know<br>neufeld maybe more about everything is<br>computer-based and<br>accessed on the internet but you should<br>look up noise for the knight for these<br>german<br>books they would look at the human scale<br>they have all these beautiful<br>dimensions so one of the things that's<br>important we were looking at<br>accessibility and kids and how they<br>would engage<br>nature within these architectural units<br>and once you once you think creatively<br>then the kids<br>and the families will use them in ways<br>that you never imagined right this is<br>someone supposed to be with<br>ellen through a binocular<br>um but the way a kid can engage nature i<br>mean those are magical moments<br>and that's what's what makes our<br>profession all worth it all<br>um and and people reach out and<br>and people need you know if you can if<br>you get 30 minutes from your home for a<br>site like this that's<br>that's equality and definitely if<br>there's public transportation which is<br>something that<br>we still lack in israel but it's it's<br>moving forward and<br>and uh there's a serenity to this and<br>there's when you live in those urban<br>moments in tel aviv<br>or jerusalem there's uh there's a gift<br>to go out and<br>last year we had a flamingo here this is<br>within one year<br>since we did the project this is within<br>one year<br>and there's like almost a thousand um<br>percent more activity in terms of<br>biology and birds<br>there's a research center so there's a<br>lot of document we have a lot of birds<br>coming from<br>from russia from from hungary and being<br>documented and there's a<br>facebook site um later if anybody would<br>be interested i can<br>i can give you the link and this is now<br>migration time you can see amazing<br>amazing birds there<br>i know that in new zealand this um<br>fossil which is a<br>rare bird in israel if you would know<br>this bird is uh<br>is in a lake in the south you would get<br>in your car and go see it and<br>now in the in this site we have three<br>families that are<br>that are nesting there so and there<br>these are magical moments right this is<br>how man meets nature<br>um in the most magical way i mean i<br>i think that um it's quite uh<br>spectacular and this image<br>was taken 36 hours ago this is the<br>sunset two days ago<br>so there are many many photographers and<br>and bird watchers that are in this park<br>24 hours these are pelicans that are now<br>in israel<br>uh specifically in the in the um emmett<br>phil valley<br>and a couple of years ago there was an<br>intent to make an airport<br>here and one of the things this park did<br>is that it engaged the community and<br>the community worked together to battle<br>off the government and<br>this project was cancelled so it's<br>another thing in our work that when<br>we create these very powerful<br>then the community embraces them and<br>that helps make<br>decision makers<br>better uh better decisions even when<br>when the um even when um<br>they don't consider things right um<br>community activism and<br>obviously is part of my my education at<br>berkeley and and<br>something that i i cherish um<br>one more project uh is the coastal park<br>in tel aviv<br>we won this competition our our studio<br>won this competition four years ago<br>was organized by tel aviv municipality<br>with the<br>architectural association and this is<br>the coast of tel aviv this is<br>basically all a new neighborhood that's<br>been planned<br>so 12 or 13 000 units<br>um okay so we're talking about a<br>almost a city of 40 000 people that's<br>going to be living here today<br>this none of this exists almost this<br>there's this development and one other<br>thing but<br>this is uh the nature park itself we're<br>gonna<br>this is a ecological corridor that runs<br>to the east<br>and um this is an aerial view of the<br>site<br>it's it's it has a very you know it's<br>very magnetic when when you look at it<br>this quote up here is by fred steiner<br>the dean of pennsylvania<br>which i thought was very um um<br>it captures a lot of who we are and what<br>we're doing the days right every<br>every one everything seems so clear from<br>the air as if the landscape were<br>where we're reflecting mirror and as we<br>know landscapes do not lie and they are<br>the embodiment of all that we do on<br>earth and this site has been disturbed<br>by um 4x4 by jeeps<br>and motorcycles over the years has been<br>deterioration and our proposal in<br>competition<br>we carefully examine um<br>all the ecological aspects um<br>of different types of birds and nature<br>that was here<br>this is the major part of the park it's<br>30 33 hectares<br>um and we looked at ecologic ecological<br>corridors<br>i think just some inspirations from the<br>um<br>arc bridge competition usa from olin and<br>even from japan<br>how they address issues of<br>turtles within their railway system so<br>when we looked at even the streets in<br>this neighborhood we were looking at how<br>to create<br>uh um asses<br>ecological uh corridors for the for to<br>pass<br>this is right over here this street<br>where basically also now these days<br>designing were<br>about in the bidding process for these<br>roads and we're working on these so<br>we're actually turning these<br>these ecological corridors in work<br>we looked at the site and how as we<br>developed for<br>for people we're also looking at what is<br>there today<br>and similar and i you know i'm happy<br>that before we look at this project we<br>looked at the one in the end except<br>because it shows what we believe if we<br>if we approach a site with the right<br>sensitivity<br>um we were basing all our approach to<br>the paths<br>within this on on the ecological surveys<br>um the junction of this ecology<br>ecological corridor and the coastline<br>we suggested something that we call the<br>forum sort of a two-dimensional plaza<br>to have events and music festivals and<br>volleyball competitions but all in a<br>natural context if all goes well within<br>three to five<br>years this part will be built but when i<br>wanted what i wanted to show today and<br>you know so we're looking at the<br>different<br>that's what is in the park and how winds<br>that<br>and um what the this junction of these<br>two roads is the lowest part of this<br>neighborhood and so we're looking at it<br>as a flooding zone<br>to help with um resiliency for the<br>neighborhood<br>and all the wetlands and associate areas<br>with that in their plant ballots<br>um cross-sectional<br>um typical section of the park um<br>it's taller than the neighborhood so in<br>essence<br>when you think of central park you're<br>going to actually walk into the bark and<br>disengage from the city and here this is<br>that you can<br>get up onto the park images<br>that we created that are part of these<br>experiments<br>in detail design is um<br>and we noticed that soil erosion is a<br>major issue um<br>um you know all these disconnections<br>um how the interference of the of the<br>material paths<br>and though we're talking about um<br>ecological restoration here so this is<br>this is a<br>an image a drone image of the site and<br>you could see how<br>the water is ripping across here and all<br>these<br>valleys are basically the water is<br>draining down it's it's mostly sand but<br>also with this red soil<br>and you can see the red soil in other<br>words that everything is is moving down<br>and and the neighborhood the new<br>neighborhood that's supposed to come in<br>is really close this is a very old<br>zoning plan i think these daily would<br>approve<br>to to build in this area and what we're<br>trying to do is minimize the damage<br>and how to really build ecologically and<br>how to<br>uh restore the soil but we're<br>what we also talked about i'm going back<br>for a minute so all the excavation for<br>this<br>neighborhood we suggested a sustainable<br>approach<br>that connects this idea of development<br>with uh ecological restoration so we're<br>looking at how<br>digging the soil we can use the<br>natural soil which is natural<br>sand with seed<br>with native plants within the park<br>and so this is a map showing the cut and<br>fill of these<br>streets of the infrastructure<br>and then an approach of looking at the<br>what is the<br>proposed elevations and the current<br>elevations so collecting the seeds and<br>the<br>geophytes and these they've all been<br>collected<br>so now we're ahead of the schedule<br>removing invasive species we're going to<br>basic<br>collect the topsoil which is the top 30<br>centimeters or the top foot<br>and then deep soil to to get to the<br>right elevations and these will all be<br>by the instructions of the soil soil<br>scientist and the ecologist<br>and these are images that we've created<br>to show these are images we show<br>to create this ecological restoration so<br>these areas this is a<br>very native and rare plant that grows on<br>this hill you can see that<br>motorbikes ripped at a cost<br>so we're looking at i call it soft<br>engineering<br>different coconuts<br>webs to stabilize the soil<br>fill and then planting seeds<br>these are the upper parts of the valleys<br>that are causing the erosion that we've<br>seen before<br>and so these approaches<br>basically were the last approval stage<br>with the<br>coastal<br>government or the coastal agencies and<br>we should be starting<br>pilot projects on this within the next<br>year<br>lastly and this is the last 15 slides of<br>my presentation is<br>is a competition that we've done<br>recently<br>and we came in second those of you who<br>um who track<br>reality shows of music and cooking you<br>all know that the second place goes the<br>first<br>farthest eventually so i'm not i'm not<br>gonna take it personally that we came in<br>uh<br>and i'd say that our major client here<br>was the matajuda which is the regional<br>council<br>and uh what we've tried to do is work<br>within the base in the thorac<br>uh river basin and it is the richest<br>the largest and richest most important<br>natural resource in the heart of israel<br>so tel aviv is north here<br>and jerusalem is right here on the hills<br>and you can see this is this is the<br>watershed<br>and one of the things this is our site<br>the dotted site<br>within its 16 kilometers of the river<br>and and the city of yavneh<br>till last year every year has been<br>flooded<br>um during the winter and we have an<br>opportunity to<br>address this issue and do something<br>special here ecologically and at the<br>same time<br>provide resiliency to the coastal areas<br>here<br>and so um we're also sitting<br>at an ecological corridor two<br>major national corridors that meet that<br>come through our site<br>and it's a region called<br>conflicts where this river we're looking<br>at it in a<br>urban um very industrial at heart<br>and mateuda which is the original<br>council which is our original client um<br>which is uh nuclear rule uh<br>quality is very much agricultural based<br>it's a<br>it's almost the napa valley of israel<br>today it's a area that is boosting with<br>wine<br>and obviously has a history for all<br>religions something we<br>we see over the years that's very<br>important to maintain for all<br>different people of all beliefs and it's<br>it's all within<br>a half an hour to an hour drive of uh 60<br>of the population<br>that means three to four million people<br>in israel can it can access this site<br>and there's going to be a major train<br>station over here<br>we've done a very large master plan i i<br>chose to speak of several projects i'm<br>not going to elaborate on the master<br>plan but we took these<br>two specific areas the city of<br>image and the<br>tsura valley and<br>they have the city is tripling within<br>the next 30 years they're gonna<br>this is the original city they're<br>building both<br>on this side of the river on the<br>southern side on the northern side<br>and we're trying to maintain a very open<br>and sustainable quarter this is 70<br>hectares<br>700 dunhams the river is flowing from<br>east to west<br>and we've been looking<br>one of the interesting issues we met<br>with the mayor which we've been getting<br>support both from from both the city and<br>the regional council i'm very<br>grateful for the mayor and one thing she<br>said she has a dream she wants a<br>european<br>uh style lake and so we've<br>created a quarter of a million cubic<br>meters of water<br>to pour over and here and one<br>one of the things we wanted to<br>demonstrate here<br>if you already noticed a pen in our work<br>is that we're working here also with<br>emil balaban from the nature conservancy<br>and working with<br>ori mohan who's a hydroecologist<br>and um hydrologist<br>is how the ecology and hydrology and<br>all of that is working in in in concert<br>with each other so we're looking at<br>um the different landscape prototypes<br>and the different natures so that<br>shows associated with it and how<br>the infrastructure is working with the<br>over uh<br>or the flooding and um right to the west<br>of this area that i spoke about<br>is this lake that we're proposing and<br>it's all based on<br>storm water that is gathered and and<br>it's being filled with overflow of water<br>and um the idea is is creating something<br>that's very sustainable and<br>this is 100 meters from the hunt when<br>you have a lockdown i think if there's a<br>lock down in your city you can walk down<br>and experience nature in an urban<br>context and so one of the things we do<br>in our office this is a view looking out<br>and now if i look at that bird<br>observatory i'm looking back<br>this is all 100 meters apart from each<br>other and<br>the type of experiences and qualities<br>that we're looking and bringing<br>to this mixed-use compass that will have<br>offices and<br>housing so lastly and these are the last<br>five or six<br>slides this is the solar valley and this<br>project will actually move forward i<br>hope this year with<br>detailed planning and we hope<br>construction next year<br>dating things about this lake uh i put<br>up on our<br>movie that we did there's a five-minute<br>movie that we engage the community<br>but this is about one kilometer wide 800<br>meters to one kilometer wide<br>six meters deep of pebble aquifer<br>that means that when i look at 16<br>kilometers of this the capacity<br>of water that this area can hold is<br>about 11 million<br>and if we can hold that water we can<br>create a landscape<br>that looks like this which basically is<br>a is a heaven for birds and for nature<br>and then this water is the water that's<br>not going to yava not flooding the urban<br>environment<br>uh downhill and so again this<br>full analysis we've looked at the<br>japanese model of how to create<br>underground berms to hold the water that<br>is now flowing freely<br>in the water in the pebble aquifer<br>and then look how transform this valley<br>in biospheric region<br>and we're looking for funding and i<br>think we already have something like<br>if all goes well uh 10 million shekels<br>which would be i would say<br>the equivalent of two and a half million<br>us dollars<br>or two million euros<br>and this is how this area would look<br>from the aerial maintaining the<br>agricultural<br>community and empowering it enhancing<br>um natural tourism the nature-based<br>tourism we have a visitors<br>center uh that we're planning over here<br>building on something that exists<br>and a reserve just in the in the heart<br>of israel so<br>um this is the<br>ending slide of my presentation and i<br>hope that through what we've built<br>you can imagine what we're trying to<br>imagine<br>in the projects that we're working on<br>these days and i hope i<br>conveyed some of the um<br>concepts that i think are very important<br>for our profession and for the cities<br>and for the lives that we<br>want to live and the planet we want to<br>leave for our children so thank you very<br>much<br>thank you leor for such an inspiring<br>lecture<br>and going through um these wide range of<br>projects from small scale to<br>large scale having always nycha at the<br>forefront<br>um while we allow some means for people<br>to get their thoughts together<br>and and and formulate their questions<br>i think i will start with<br>how have you managed to deal with<br>different stakeholders and especially<br>uh governmental agencies and councils to<br>convey the idea that nature should be<br>at the forefront of this of the designs<br>and especially when<br>it seems to me that you are going<br>through a period of dense urbanization<br>in israel<br>how has been the experience around that<br>you are i think you are muted we can't<br>okay so um when i worked at the<br>uh operations office and we<br>and we would go up to yosemite he would<br>talk about the salmon in san francisco<br>that<br>they swim up the river against the<br>current and he said landscape architects<br>were like salmon we<br>or trout we swim against the current and<br>then the winter comes and then we die<br>and then the young ones or the students<br>or the next generation<br>flows down to the ocean and then later<br>they come up to lay<br>their eggs and etc so it's not the<br>easiest path<br>and and i think that<br>we're creating a situation that our<br>studio has<br>a polarization between people that will<br>never get anywhere close to us<br>to those that would never take another<br>uh another client another<br>landscape architect and we battle for<br>things that we believe in and<br>we do it looking<br>for the partnerships and and working<br>very hard you know to<br>engineering uh some say that engineering<br>is the most conservative<br>um idealism in the world other than<br>religious religion so<br>when we work with engineers we have to<br>work hard to<br>express our ideas and we have to find<br>the means of how to work<br>both with engineers and both with our<br>concepts of nature<br>and i feel that the new generations<br>especially when we<br>teach these ideals at school both to<br>keep architects we're putting the seeds<br>for sure but these projects<br>many of them the projects that are going<br>on seven and<br>eight years and um<br>and if i could give any advice if you<br>can never get a commission like<br>some of these that we have luck on get<br>them in an early age so you'll live long<br>enough to build<br>them that's all i can say in that matter<br>um looking at our participants is there<br>don't forget to unmute yourselves or if<br>you are too shy you can always type the<br>well while we allow people to probably<br>think more about your questions<br>um looking at it professionally or what<br>what's your opinion in terms of um<br>what we should be doing that we are not<br>doing at the moment as landscape<br>architects<br>i think i think that uh um<br>one of the things and i i didn't say<br>much about the<br>the office the uh our studio<br>i feel very much we're 15 at the office<br>and uh<br>very talented very talented staff and<br>very devoted<br>um i think that one of the things that<br>we try to push for the office<br>i say it's not just me it's our office<br>is for innovation<br>and to research you know to do<br>innovation the other<br>half of innovation is research you have<br>to you have to when you try to innovate<br>you have to base it on some research so<br>you don't fail the first minute you<br>start<br>i think that researching a topic<br>researching history<br>the ecology of a site a community what<br>are the<br>values of the community are working if i<br>design for with the bedroom in the south<br>i need to sit on the mat in their tent<br>and i have to listen and have to hear<br>what's important for them what values<br>what the what they want for their<br>children what type of life they want<br>i think that in a world that's been that<br>today is very uh rough<br>you know where we as as<br>you know human beings we're less<br>sensitive to our environment we don't<br>see the<br>the weak is enough we don't see the the<br>fragile and the ill i think that um<br>if we look at them carefully we'll be<br>better people we'll do better in our<br>work<br>that's a very positive message<br>um someone just wrote a question<br>salvador<br>the villa how do you incorporate the<br>maintenance of the<br>of those large sites as part of the buy<br>off from the clients is this part<br>of a collaborative process with the<br>community<br>and or the client city developer<br>um salvador we studied together and uh<br>he's also an amazing landscape architect<br>working in northern california and then<br>and i'm very glad an honor to have<br>my friend join us i think and i was<br>speaking about it on the green roof<br>that when we tried to uh look at these<br>nature based parks what the way we build<br>them with computers<br>these contractors are used to building<br>differently they go and buy the cheapest<br>type of stuff in a nursery and they plan<br>stuff that whatever way they do they<br>want to do it<br>and when we do things different um<br>you know with all modesty i learn on<br>these projects on each and every one of<br>them because we're working with<br>ecologists and soil scientists and<br>and hydrologists and ecohydrologists<br>and we are learning in this process and<br>we're trying to um<br>engage the college and the client both<br>in the planning process and both in the<br>construction<br>and we talked about how these landscapes<br>need to be maintained<br>and both both us and our<br>our partners different consultants<br>we usually uh you know just like in that<br>courtyard we kept doing research there a<br>year after we finished the project<br>and we were talking with them about the<br>plants and seeing what's working and<br>what's not<br>and that's knowledge we take to the next<br>project and it's also something the<br>client knows and determines<br>what plants are working what are not<br>um and uh even when we base our research<br>on what the reservoir of water is to<br>water during the summer<br>we learn if we need to plant it larger<br>or smaller and what happens when the<br>climate is not exactly what we wanted<br>and there's a bit<br>and then and and um<br>and uh there isn't enough rain so i<br>would say that<br>um it's it's we're still in a learning<br>process<br>i i cannot say confidently that we're<br>experts we're learning with everybody<br>else<br>and we're saying that up in advance that<br>we're going to go through this together<br>and there's enough obligation<br>on all hands to to do this but there's<br>also great pride when a client<br>is leading this process they see<br>themselves as leaders in how to<br>look forward especially these<br>it took us of course and we're not<br>speaking about climate change<br>climate change and we're not it's<br>that it's not being talked about these<br>days but<br>that needs to be an agenda and the way<br>we think and plan<br>right one last question for you from<br>rosanne<br>um during your presentation<br>i was remembering the lake<br>of fueler when israel decided to dry it<br>in 1951 and later they discovered it was<br>a mistake<br>if i understand well the future vision<br>don't you think that this<br>um i'm not sure i understood the<br>question maybe it's the hour it's not<br>that was a historic that was a historic<br>mistake<br>that was a historic mistake but it was<br>it was fixed over time<br>and you know it's one of the most<br>amazing uh<br>nature reserves in israel is desahula<br>there's a lot of scrutiny on on these<br>projects and we're being reviewed by<br>many many<br>authorities and committees<br>and many professionals and<br>there is a chance we'll fail in some of<br>them you need to put that out there but<br>i would say because we're research-based<br>because we're doing it modestly because<br>we're consulting we usually<br>fight to get the best consultants to<br>work with<br>we're trying to minimize the potential<br>all right we are thank you very much for<br>your time<br>and for your amazing presentation and to<br>guide us through
