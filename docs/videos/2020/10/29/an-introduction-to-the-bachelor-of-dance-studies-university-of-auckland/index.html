Yes.<br>I came from the University of Otago where <br>I finished my PhD there and before that<br>I was a special needs teacher and a <br>secondary school physical education  <br>teacher and a primary school teacher in Australia.<br>I have vast experience in writing <br>policy for the minister in Queensland,  <br>and so I came to this position with <br>a very strong interest in education,<br>not so much in teaching students <br>to be performers, but more to be  <br>all-round holistic, good at everything in <br>dance because that's what I have found to be  <br>the thing of the future and <br>the thing that's needed.<br>My name is Sarah Walmsley. I’m a <br>third-year currently studying the  <br>undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Dance Studies.<br>I originally came from Te Puke, so I didn't <br>live in Auckland, so I moved up here, which  <br>was a crazy move because I didn't know anybody and <br>I didn't know what the dance scene was up here,<br>but I came up for the audition, <br>and I just loved the programme,<br>and I’ve always loved dance, and <br>I did a little bit of dancing.<br>I did tap and jazz competition dancing when I was <br>in high school, and I danced in the high school  <br>dance programme in my high school, and I just <br>loved dance, and I wanted to keep going, and I was  <br>like, "where can I do it?" and then I came up here <br>for the audition, and it was amazing, and I came  <br>up for the Open Day and just the whole department <br>was so welcoming, and it was - everybody was so  <br>nice and all the current Dance Studies students <br>that were here, they were so welcoming, and I was  <br>like, "this is the place that I want to come and <br>a place that I want to be able to do what I love."<br>So I was like - it was nice, I liked it.<br>That's good. It's good to have you here.<br>I made some friends. I was cool,  <br>but yeah. No, it's definitely been one of the best <br>choices of my life to come up here. I love it.<br>Hi, my name is Villa Junior Lemanu.  <br>Yeah, I started - I’m a graduate <br>of this degree. I started in 2015.<br>Yeah, I’m a South Auckland <br>boy, came from Otahuhu College.<br>I came because I wanted to become a dance <br>teacher and then learnt a whole bunch of  <br>stuff here and ended up changing my course <br>of like my future plans and everything.<br>Now, I’m currently a freelance dancer and actor.<br>I also - yeah, started my first year as a  <br>fixed-term, part-time lecturer here in some <br>courses. Yeah, and just finding my way through.<br>So the teachers we have, we have a whole host of <br>different types of teachers with different skills,  <br>and they're all different, and that's purposeful<br>because I don't want all the teachers teaching in <br>the same way or teaching from the same position.<br>So as Sarah said, Sarah Knox comes from a strong  <br>performance choreographic background, <br>and that's what she teaches,  <br>and Sarah would have also had some classes <br>from Becca - Dr Becca Weber...and Dr Snook?<br>And we talked mostly about how to teach in <br>dance education, how to move the body safely.<br>So Villa, so you didn't go into it, but <br>you've done a lot of stuff out there.<br>Well, I’ve seen, over a number <br>of years, different tour groups.<br>I really adapted a lot of what I learned <br>at the University of Auckland into a lot of  <br>those performances and I felt like I <br>could see it throughout the years as well.<br>I felt like every year that I’ve done a <br>performance, there's always something that  <br>I’ve picked up from either classes or just with <br>working with friends at the University and yeah,<br>I’ve found myself develop over time and it's -  <br>I always have to bring it back <br>to the University of Auckland.<br>It's really cool what you start <br>looking at or how you look at dance.<br>And I think one of the things you said <br>which is really important is working with  <br>your friends or your peers.<br>Like, these dance studios in a normal period of <br>time are quite busy up to 11 o'clock at night,  <br>and they start being busy around nine <br>o'clock in the morning, sometimes earlier,<br>but it's - they're booked out by these guys <br>doing their work and just working together,  <br>and it's a very loose kind of situation, <br>but that working with your friends  <br>is invaluable, and that's when you sort <br>out all sorts of how-to kind of situations.<br>So, where we do our work are <br>in these studios all the time,  <br>and we sort of want them to be your space.<br>They're sort of not, you <br>know, the University space,  <br>even though they are, but I want <br>the students to own the space.<br>So, it's very much you come in, you look after it, <br>but, you know, for your time, make it your own.<br>Like, move the curtains however <br>you want to, put your own music on.<br>And we've got a studio here, studio there,  <br>so three studios in this building and <br>another very large studio down there.<br>And we're very proud of our studios now.<br>They're great. And upstairs we have  <br>amazing postgraduate facilities for all the <br>writing and the reading and carrying on.<br>Like, really amazing research facilities.<br>Again, we're very, very, very <br>proud of that so it's great.<br>Yeah, so I feel like everyone that's in high <br>school probably is feeling the same thing.<br>Like, I remember feeling really, really anxious <br>and unsure about university because I didn't know  <br>what it would feel like, be like.<br>Everything that was talked <br>about university is very,  <br>very stressful and, you know, like very <br>intellectual and for a person like me,  <br>I get stressed quite easy so I was <br>very scared. I know that for sure.<br>And I was doing research into what I wanted to <br>do and I was looking into dance institutions.<br>I went to quite a few dance institutions <br>just to check out the space.  <br>And the University of Auckland, I actually had <br>to sign up a lot online and everything first,  <br>so I was still quite sceptical <br>until I came to the audition day.<br>Come to the audition day!<br>You'll know straight away.<br>As soon as you walk into the space, <br>you'll see a whole bunch of students.<br>Everyone's in the same boat, everyone's scared.<br>Sometimes there will be a few students that <br>already know each other and they're together,  <br>and that makes you scared <br>because you're not with anyone.<br>Sarah Knox and yourself came as well <br>- being dressed up like this too.<br>That's scary, okay? If you come in suits.<br>But yeah, as soon as Ralph talks,  <br>he puts you off guard and you realise <br>everyone's just human, and yeah.<br>I just remember playing games, meeting with <br>people. I met a whole bunch of my classes names  <br>on that day, and yeah, it completely just broke <br>this myth aye, that it's this really scary place<br>And I knew straight away that, yeah, it was <br>a really communal vibe, the people are cool.  <br>Yeah, I had a whole bunch of laughs that day.<br>I already felt like I was part of the degree.<br>And so for me, my experience going from high <br>school to university was a really easy shift.<br>Oh, I come from Te Puke, so that's like not in <br>Auckland. It's quite far away from Auckland.<br>A little small town.<br>But so, the audition was scary for me because I <br>didn't know what the dance scene in Auckland was.<br>I was like, I didn't know what the <br>level was, how good I had to be,  <br>like, that was probably what scared me the <br>most is that I had no clue what to expect.<br>I hadn't done auditions like that <br>before and because I think it's such an  <br>audition that holds such a heavy <br>weight to me because I was like,<br>"I want to do this. Like, this is my future.<br>If I don't do well then - what <br>am I going to do?" You know?<br>But I got there.<br>Yeah, well that's what I felt like, and I <br>feel like that's what lots of people feel<br>because auditioning to get into a university <br>degree is different to just having to get  <br>a rank score to get in, and I think that's <br>what in dance kind of scared me a little bit.<br>But then I got there and it was like, I didn't <br>know a single person. There were people in the  <br>room who knew each other which, like <br>same as you, was a little bit scary,  <br>but as soon as - five minutes <br>in, it was totally the opposite.<br>Like, all of you guys came in, we talked, and <br>all the dance study students were so lovely.<br>They were so, so nice. They all got along,  <br>and it kind of gave you - they gave me an <br>insight of what the department was like.<br>It wasn't like this one where they <br>stood and watched me dance and were,  <br>like, judging how good I am.<br>It was more of like, I was seeing <br>what the department was like,  <br>and the department was seeing how I fit <br>into it, you know, and it was really nice.<br>And even when we had - you have like <br>an interview and have a chat in it -<br>it's not about like, show me all <br>your experience and who are you.<br>It was kind of just like, "Hi, <br>nice to meet you. How are you?"<br>Like, the same kind of thing, it's just like,  <br>you want to see us and we want to see, you <br>know? It was kind of like a two-way street.<br>And I literally remember leaving that day and <br>I was - I had the biggest smile on my face, and  <br>my mom was like, "what happened in there?" She was <br>like, "I thought you were going into an audition."<br>And she was like, "literally if you get <br>into that, that is the place to go."<br>She's like, "because the way you came out of <br>that, it's just that you were so happy and you  <br>just felt yourself even though you didn't know <br>a single person in the room when you walked in."<br>And so I think that's like an <br>amazing part. So, the audition,  <br>although it sounds scary, is really the opposite.<br>Like, it's literally, like gave me a <br>step into what this degree was like,  <br>so then coming in, I knew what to expect.<br>The first day when you met everybody, <br>I was like, "it's the same."<br>Like, I saw people I saw on that day and <br>we did stuff, we played the games we did,  <br>and we saw the lecturers, and you guys <br>are so lovely so I was like, it was nice.<br>So, I just want to share a quick experience of a <br>moment that switched for me during the audition  <br>and it was when - so, before you go into the <br>audition, you'll notice that you have to have a  <br>little interview with the Head of Department, and <br>I remember - interviews, I didn't have much, like,  <br>experience of interviews so I was really, <br>really nervous and I was like, "okay, cool."<br>So, I wrote down like a whole CV of <br>everything that I’ve done and I was like,  <br>"okay, I’m gonna say this, they're gonna like me."<br>I just kept saying, "they're gonna like me,"  <br>because I’ve done all of these things and I’m <br>just gonna have - I’d written down everything.<br>And I come up to this interview and I sit down <br>with Ralph, and the first thing he asked me  <br>was, "yeah, so how was your day?"<br>And I was like, "yeah, it was good." And I was <br>able to get my CV out. He's like, "oh yeah, so  <br>how's your school? What did you do at <br>school? What's dance like at your schools?"  <br>And then I think that was the interview.<br>As soon as he asked me that I think we were done.<br>But, what I got from that was that it's - they <br>care more about the people in this degree.  <br>They care more about if you have a genuine <br>curiosity about dance, and if they can see  <br>that you're someone that's serious about dance and <br>want to take it further, or if you're someone that  <br>is genuinely there, just interested and wanting <br>to learn more about dance, then that's really  <br>what they care about, and so that was a really <br>cool epiphany that I had during that audition.<br>It's great. I’m very glad that's how you feel.<br>I’m very glad that's how you feel<br>because that's exactly what we're trying <br>to make people feel is welcome, home, safe.<br>Before I talk about me going out,  <br>I want to talk about all of the stuff <br>that I thought about while I was in,<br>because there's so many things <br>that I was like - I definitely knew  <br>by the end of the degree I wanted to <br>become a dance teacher, that was for sure.  <br>But, after my first year, I realised there's <br>a whole multitude of dance opportunities  <br>or just job opportunities that <br>Dance Studies can help you get into.<br>For example, after my first year, we  <br>did quite a few lessons on kinesiology. I <br>think that was first-year or second-year.<br>But, I remember after that I’m being <br>like, "wow, I really like this. I like  <br>studying muscles. I like how <br>they connect to each other."<br>I was like, "cool, you know what? <br>I'm gonna be a massage therapist  <br>by the end of this course," and I was like, <br>"sweet, I'm definitely sussed on that."<br>And then as soon as I hit <br>Dance Technique I was like,  <br>"nah, I want to go back to being a dance teacher."<br>So, in the whole course of four <br>years - cause I was there for  <br>four years cause I did it part-time in a few years<br>ah, in the last two years of study -<br>I wanted to be a dance teacher, dance <br>physiotherapist, a lecturer at the University,  <br>a professional choreographer, a professional <br>dancer. I wanted to dance for a company.<br>What else did I want to do? I wanted <br>to teach primary school at one point<br>and then I wanted to...what else did I want to do?<br>Just become a dance scholar, <br>go into postgraduate studies.<br>That's just off the top of my head like right now.<br>There's quite a few things that I wanted to do.  <br>Just a lot of jobs that popped up that I didn't <br>even know was a job, so that was real interesting.<br>But, what was also cool about that was by the end  <br>of my third year I knew <br>exactly what I wanted to do.<br>So, even though there were <br>so many job opportunities and  <br>focuses that I could have gone to,<br>by the end of that whole course I knew, yeah, <br>I was quite certain on what I wanted to do.<br>Currently, I’m teaching part-time fixed-term as <br>a lecturer which suits really well with what I  <br>want to do because I’m also freelancing as <br>a dancer and choreographer and an actor.<br>And at the same time, I’m <br>also teaching workshops -  <br>acting workshops with Massive Theatre <br>Company, as well as dance workshops  <br>in schools which I’m still in the mix <br>of talking with dance teachers about.<br>And what else am I doing? And I’m working <br>on shows. And I’m working on shows.<br>So, it's quite a mix of things. You're not 'a <br>thing', but many, many jobs at the same time.<br>Is that hard to manage?<br>No, and I can tell you why!<br>Because during my second year of university,  <br>there's - you have Dance Vocab which <br>is pretty much the choreography paper.<br>And there's a chance for you to dance in other <br>people's works and other people's choreography.<br>In that span, I was in quite a - <br>I put myself - I dug myself into a  <br>hole...if that's the term. <br>Painted myself into a corner.<br>And I was in a multitude of pieces.<br>I was in seven different choreographies I think <br>that year, and what that meant was I had to be  <br>really on point with my time management, <br>with my discipline, with my schedule,  <br>and rather than being - rather than learning that <br>I had to not do that, I learned how to manage that  <br>and so from there I’m quite experienced now in <br>terms of, like, managing such a busy schedule.<br>At the beginning of this year, <br>that was when we were meant to  <br>go on tour but unfortunately, <br>we didn't because of Covid.<br>But, I did the whole two-month <br>training period up until the  <br>day we pretty were much meant to <br>leave and we still did the show.<br>I loved it, like, I really did.<br>It was an amazing experience.<br>It was something that definitely highlighted this <br>degree for me as well because it's an opportunity  <br>that you don't really get offered anywhere <br>else, and it's such a unique opportunity.<br>And so, basically, you were in the studio <br>every day from 8am till 5pm, 10 hour days.<br>It was quite long days, but you spend  <br>the whole day, like, working with your peers and <br>you're constantly bettering yourself as an artist.<br>They get choreographers from the industry who <br>are relevant to come in, and they work with you,<br>and then, we did lots of different styles.<br>We did hip-hop, we did a Pacific piece,  <br>we did a jazz piece, we did, like, a <br>comedic piece. It was really interesting.<br>So, I'd never explored that before.<br>Did you do ballroom as well?<br>Yeah, and there was a ballroom piece! We had the <br>whole lineup. We did a little bit of everything.<br>It was a very, very mixed bag <br>this year, which was great.<br>Which was amazing because lots <br>of that - it was amazing to see  <br>how everybody -cause all of us come <br>from different backgrounds in dance.<br>We don't all have the same experience, but <br>to put all of us in a scenario where we  <br>had to do that together was amazing <br>to see how we all came out of it.<br>And you became a better teacher, you <br>became a better collaborator in the space,  <br>you became a better artist in yourself because <br>you've got all this diverse experience,  <br>and you're working with artists who have <br>had this experience in the industry.<br>And ours was led by Sarah Knox, <br>so she was an amazing teacher.<br>So, she taught us so many valuable <br>things which I think they would have  <br>been amazing to use on tour, but also <br>just within my practice today, and then,  <br>like with who I am as a <br>person is just so beneficial.<br>It just helped the way you think,  <br>and the way you act, and the way you, <br>like, present yourself in a space.<br>It's just so valuable and I <br>think that's what I loved it.<br>So, it was unfortunate we didn't get to <br>go on the tour but I would do all those  <br>10 hour days again just for what I <br>learned and what I got out of it.<br>So, yes, it was amazing. I loved it.<br>Because right now I’m like <br>halfway through my third year  <br>and what I found throughout this <br>degree is that I, like, love it all.<br>Everything I feel like is so relevant <br>within the industry now, same as you,  <br>that I just want to, like put a <br>foot in the door in all of it.<br>I want to keep my options open, and <br>so I love the idea of teaching, like,  <br>that's something I really want to do <br>and I’m starting to get into more.<br>And then I also love being in a studio, like that <br>is where I feel at home, collaborating with my  <br>peers, and then I also love the research aspect <br>of it and, like, taking dance further than just  <br>what's in the studio and so that stuff is amazing <br>and I have the opportunity to do all of that.<br>Like, I have the opportunity to do post-grad which  <br>I’m really interested in <br>because it sounds amazing,<br>but then also, being a part of Dance <br>Studies I think is so valuable because  <br>you are going into the industry with all these <br>friends and all these peers at the same time.<br>So, I could go into the industry and put on a <br>show with all my people that are in my class,  <br>like all my friends, because all of <br>us have the same experience and we're  <br>all - the stuff you learn at the University <br>is relevant. It's part of the industry today.<br>You're learning from lecturers who have done <br>stuff in the industry, who are still in there.<br>You get taught in technique papers <br>by people who are putting on shows.<br>Like, all of that kind of stuff opens up <br>opportunities and gives you connections  <br>that are just friendships.<br>It's not like you have to network to <br>get into it. It's like you know these  <br>people, they're your friends, you've hung out <br>with them, you can go get coffee with them.<br>Like, that kind of stuff I think <br>is so valuable because - and the  <br>fact that we get to do whatever we want to do.<br>Like, I always get asked by my mum and she's like,  <br>"so what are you gonna do?" <br>and I’m like "everything."<br>Like, I’m going to do it all, but I <br>don't know how I’m going to do it.<br>How are you going to do that?<br>But I have the opportunity to do that.<br>I can carry on my research and later on,  <br>I could go and put on a show or I could <br>do some dance classes on the side.<br>Like, it doesn't mean that <br>once you leave the University  <br>all the stuff that you're doing has to stop.<br>You have the opportunity to engage with it.<br>Even though it might be like on the side, <br>I might take a dance class whereas, like,  <br>full time I’m researching, like all of that kind <br>of stuff is possible and that's what I like.<br>It means that I don't have to stop doing what I <br>love, because I love it all, which is really nice.<br>And I'd also definitely put in a  <br>highlight on the fact that you know people and <br>that your friends are there to support you.<br>Like, the support system <br>within the degree is so lovely.<br>Like, that's a big thing for me.<br>The whole first year, the support that I got, <br>especially because I didn't come from here  <br>and I didn't know the companies in Auckland, <br>and I didn't know all of that kind of stuff.<br>It's like I got supported through <br>that and I feel like that support  <br>has still carried me through my degree and will <br>continue to carry me through once I’ve left.<br>I personally just ended up feeling supported, like <br>what Sarah’s saying, like just with the peers,  <br>but also the lecturers because the <br>lectures are very just easy to talk to.<br>And so, there are definitely certain lecturers <br>throughout my first year that I could just, if I  <br>had a problem or if I had an issue, I'd just go up <br>to the lecturer and just tell them, talk to them.<br>There's also the Tuākana programme <br>which is a Māori and Pacific programme<br>that helps - ah, it's a programme <br>that helps Māori and Pacific students  <br>just with work, or just with - <br>just to have a collaborative space,  <br>in order to talk about anything <br>that they're finding tricky.<br>Sometimes they'll just open it up to <br>anyone that's feeling the same problems.<br>But yeah, I personally didn't <br>even feel super stressed out.<br>I felt very supported by just the <br>whole Dance Studies programme.<br>And what was support - when you say support, <br>was it the same, just teachers and friends?<br>Yeah, I think it was definitely the same, <br>and I also think it was the fact that  <br>being in this degree, people know <br>your name, like they know who you are.<br>I think that's a big thing. It's not like you're <br>just another number coming into the degree.<br>It's like pretty much everybody in <br>the degree knows I’m not from here,<br>like they know what my parents do, like all my <br>friends know who I am, they know where I live.<br>Like, all of that kind of stuff  <br>gives you a support in your degree <br>in a way that I think is so valuable.<br>I wish I learned about scholarships earlier.<br>I wish I knew about grants earlier,  <br>and I think it's weird because it's <br>something that's so easy to find.<br>Like, if you go onto the University website and <br>just write "scholarships," you'll come up with a  <br>whole bunch of links and articles, and even if you <br>don't even come across that, you could always ask  <br>Ralph, or other lecturers, or even students,  <br>because there's so many opportunities to get <br>some scholarships, some help, some support.<br>Because I moved from Te Puke, obviously, <br>I didn't really know anybody up here,  <br>so I stayed in the halls for my first year, so <br>that's also an added cost on top of the degree.<br>But, before I came up here, my mum <br>was a big advocate and just like,  <br>"apply for anything and everything."<br>And so, I applied for lots of scholarships <br>at the University of Auckland,<br>and I applied for those big 20 grand scary <br>ones, that top achiever, all of that,<br>and unfortunately, I didn't get one of those,  <br>but what was amazing within that <br>is I didn't get one of those,<br>but in the process, my name had gotten nominated <br>to the panel in the Creative Arts and Industries  <br>for a scholarship that I didn't even know existed.<br>I didn't even know it was a thing,  <br>and so I got nominated for that, <br>and luckily I got awarded that.<br>So, I got this email one day being like, "hey, <br>here's a scholarship that you didn't apply for."<br>And so, that gave me five grand in <br>my first year to help out with halls,  <br>and that was just from applying for <br>a scholarship that I didn't really  <br>meet all the requirements for, but I was <br>like, "why not? Like, see how it goes."<br>Top tip? Yeah, there's a whole bunch of <br>things, but for me to leave with you now:  <br>Dance Studies is gonna push your understanding <br>of dance, just in the wider sense.<br>So, my top tip would be to remain <br>open, especially in this first year<br>there's going to be a whole bunch of stuff <br>that they're going to try and teach you  <br>in this first year.<br>So, just remain open, absorb as <br>much stuff as you need, stay curious  <br>and also - this is not even one tip, <br>it's like a whole bunch of tips!<br>Just bring yourself as well. Like, it's not <br>about conforming or, in any sense, it's about  <br>how you develop, and your interests, <br>and your - just being you, pretty much.<br>So yeah, all of those things.<br>Mine kind of goes off what Villa's is.<br>Mine is kind of just bring <br>your whole self to the degree.<br>Don't be afraid to bring where you come from,  <br>who you are, the people you <br>know, the people you don't know.<br>All of that is relevant within the space, and <br>so, even though it might be a scary thing to  <br>come into somewhere where you don't know <br>anybody, and you're bringing your dance,<br>which is such, like, a personal thing <br>for you, it's like, bring it all.<br>Don't be afraid to be who you are, and stand <br>out, or talk to people and get to know everybody.<br>Because it's such an important thing.<br>This degree is tailored for you to be who <br>you are and then, like, thrive within that.<br>Like, it's tailored for you to go where you <br>want, and all the stuff we learn, and all the  <br>papers and everything we do is tailored so <br>you can follow your interests within that.<br>They're not aiming, as like Villa said, <br>for you to become a certain thing.<br>They want you to become everything you want to be.<br>And so, just bring your whole self and don't be <br>afraid of who you are because it's so important.<br>And I feel like everybody <br>in the degree, you see that.<br>Like, you constantly are getting inspired by <br>everybody, and so take all of that and, like,  <br>learn from everybody, learn from the diversity <br>within this degree because it's so valuable.<br>And then, going into the industry, <br>like, keep doing that, just keep  <br>bringing who you are and just showing <br>it and having fun... and being groovy.<br>Thank you for coming.<br>Thank you for having me.<br>Thank you for coming.<br>It's really great and it's very, very, <br>very inspiring listening to you both,  <br>and I feel like it's a great <br>introduction for other people.<br>And I look forward to meeting <br>lots and lots of new students -<br>as you apply, as you audition, <br>as you ring up, send emails -<br>and welcome to the University <br>of Auckland Dance Studies.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
