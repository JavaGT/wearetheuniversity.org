Landscapes in emergency”.<br><br>This lecture focuses on the migratory pressures of the Mediterranean region that currently are exacerbating inequalities, undermining human rights, and environmental justice. At the end of 2019, 79.5 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. Nearly 50 million of them are internally displaced while 73% are hosted in neighbouring countries, with the majority of the world’s refugees (85%) hosted by developing countries. Lebanon is host to nearly 1.2 million Syrian refugees, representing around a quarter of the country’s total population. The transformation we are witnessing in the last decades is leading to a societal shift and to the production of entirely new landscapes in which old and new narratives and memories are mixed up. This lecture questions the role of landscape design in envisioning scenarios at varying scales and phases of intervention to address social and environmental emergencies. The work presented acknowledges those challenges, focusing on defining liminal paths between humanitarian design, right to shared landscapes, and wellbeing of communities. The lecture also explores the work of the Landscape Architects Without Borders (LAWB) of the International Federation of Landscape Architects, committed to working with vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, especially those affected by war, conflict and natural disaster, helping them to re-create safe, sustainable and dignified living conditions.<br><br>Maria Gabriella Trovato is an Assistant Professor at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon. She is a licensed Architect and a Landscape Architect with a PhD in Landscape Architecture. As an architect practising and teaching landscape design, Maria Gabriella is interested in investigating new forms of urban living in a world of change and fluxing conditions due to climate change, depletion of natural resources, conflicts between globalization and local development, and re-localization of war refugees. Her work urges us to respond to such pressures by investigating and proposing combinations of ecological performance and design culture. Most recent research projects focus on landscape in an emergency, landscape assessment and waste management, migration governance, among others; funded by many agencies, such as European Union, Cross-Border Cooperation in the Mediterranean, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, etc. As chair of the IFLA Working Group Landscape Architecture Without Borders (LAWB), she is working on informal Syrian settlements (ISs) in Lebanon, exploring landscape methodologies that could permit the definition of a flexible, relational and creative strategy capable of managing continuous changing and transformations. She has worked in several countries, teaching landscape architecture at undergraduate and graduate programs, seminars, and design workshops in Europe, Canada, Africa, and the Middle East.<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students, and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>warm

uh don't forget<br>that gabriella<br>is sharing her screen as you can see so<br>keep this window open so you can see the<br>slides<br>and also would ask you to remain muted<br>throughout the talk<br>and do not worry at the end we will have<br>time for questions<br>either verbally or you can also write<br>them in a chat box if you feel a little<br>shy<br>without further ado please join me in<br>giving gabriella a warm welcome<br>okay thank you bruno thank you for<br>inviting me to this<br>series of lecture it's a great pleasure<br>to be with all of you today and i feel<br>part of this big<br>community that is sprawled and dispersed<br>all over the world<br>and thank you for your introduction<br>and today uh what i will do<br>it's um um kind of um<br>um thought<br>um allowed i mean it's a kind of<br>discussion that i want to share with you<br>and<br>it's um a kind of<br>reflection about what i did<br>in the past years while living in<br>lebanon and a series of questions<br>that i would like to share with you<br>on how to move forward<br>and i will<br>start with these sentence<br>that carl schwab<br>said during the world economic forum<br>and he spoke about the great<br>reset and there were two questions that<br>were really important how can we size<br>this moment of disruption<br>to push for a world that is healthier<br>more resilient<br>sustainable and just and what do all of<br>us<br>individuals business and governments<br>need to do<br>to ensure that we don't simply revert to<br>what was before<br>then these are the two question at the<br>beginning<br>and then we will see that we will finish<br>also with other questions<br>and i move directly to this<br>image of banksy<br>the land artist and<br>because as bruno mentioned in the<br>introduction<br>my work in the past few years<br>was focused specifically on<br>migration and relation in relation to<br>landscape and i found it really<br>interesting<br>this image in which there are<br>these birds competing saying vigrants<br>not welcome<br>go back to africa keep off our worms<br>and um and seeing ourselves<br>in the position of the birds it's<br>um it's quite frightening<br>and why it's frightening because if we<br>look really<br>what's happening in the world uh one<br>percent of humanity is uprooted<br>and between them but in a more lucky<br>position<br>and um there are um<br>there were 100 millions of people that<br>were displaced<br>in a decade and specifically if we look<br>at this graph<br>the forcibly displaced people and<br>millions<br>passed from 2010 to 2019<br>from 41.1 millions<br>to 79.5 millions<br>that in itself it's really frightening<br>but<br>what really scare more is how they are<br>divided the fact that there are um<br>only in venezuela and venezuela's<br>venezuelans displaced abroad 3.6 million<br>4.2 million<br>asylum seekers 45 by<br>7 million internally displaced people<br>and 26 million<br>refugees<br>and then if we look at this um<br>dashboard we have in the middle<br>something that<br>really must let us think<br>on what we are doing there are over 30<br>million<br>children that are forced bleed is placed<br>and the majority of the people displaced<br>that they came<br>from just the five countries<br>and these countries are syria<br>with 6.7 million south sudan<br>with 2.3 million afghanistan with 2.7<br>million<br>near myanmar with 1.1 and somalia with<br>000. then as bruno mentioned before<br>my concern and my studies<br>is more focused on the mediterranean<br>region first<br>because i'm i'm bored<br>and i was raised just<br>in the middle of the mediterranean<br>because i come from sicily<br>and second because i spent all my life<br>working and moving all around the<br>mediterranean<br>region and moving from north to south<br>from east<br>to west then was the situation in the<br>mediterranean region<br>and the um<br>we know and we have this displacement<br>that never stopped between the different<br>uh part of the<br>mediterranean passing and<br>the number of people dying are<br>increasing<br>due to the political decision<br>and the governmental rules that were<br>taken<br>specifically in the last year and this<br>idea<br>and this concept of fortress europe<br>is leading us on refusing people<br>and letting people dying without helping<br>them<br>then i believe that while we are in<br>2020 this is really uh<br>something that we can't stand on but um<br>as we have seen before the the major<br>crisis the one that<br>is really uh taking<br>over right now and is the syrian crisis<br>with 5.6 million syrian strategies<br>and 6.6 million that are displaced<br>inside the country and 90 percent of the<br>syrian refugees<br>live in urban areas in the neighboring<br>countries and specifically in<br>turkey lebanon jordan iraq<br>and egypt and i have to say that since i<br>arrived in lebanon in 2012 i have seen<br>all the evolution of<br>the movement and displacement of people<br>and all of this movement is creating a<br>new leader in a landscape<br>but i'm not sure we<br>we can be proud of these<br>new mediterranean landscape if we look<br>at the pictures<br>that i selected down there are people<br>that are dying there are people that are<br>imported that live in really difficult<br>conditions<br>and and then as a landscape architect<br>that is that i'm interested in the<br>social and cultural component but also<br>the<br>special configuration of our landscape<br>i'm really worried of the future of this<br>part of the world and looking at the<br>migration of syrians shape the<br>landscape of the country is tangible<br>and intangible tangible in the series of<br>informal standard settlement<br>that were spread all over the country<br>creating<br>these kind of horizontal and<br>geographical urban<br>urbanization and they were all located<br>in agricultural land<br>on the other hand it's um it's less<br>visible and<br>the it's happening in the um<br>in the urban very urban area<br>and we have syrians living in a<br>residential building<br>and we have this vertical occupation and<br>density and<br>the majority of the case these are<br>buildings that<br>are in um that<br>are not finished or they were abundant<br>for<br>a specific reason then they leave really<br>conditions all they live in substandard<br>buildings<br>like for example garage<br>or other type of space in suburban<br>area these are some of the data that<br>we that i i took from the<br>unhcr they are not very updated<br>they are back to 2018 and it's um<br>it's a little bit ago but what's<br>important is the fact that<br>um there is this continuous movement and<br>the number of floating and that<br>and are changing continuously because<br>of the movement of experiencing inside<br>of the country<br>and i<br>during my period in lebanon i did<br>several research um radical<br>and also practical with my students<br>and for example i'm i researched<br>and i'm still researching on this<br>building inside<br>said it's a city just on the coast and<br>this is beirut and said this year<br>and in the southern part of lebanon and<br>there is this<br>there was this building of<br>frozen real estate uh development at the<br>outskirts of science that was to become<br>a campus<br>um for the aliman al-uzza<br>university and instead<br>they welcomed the refugees<br>and then now it's a kind of a vertical<br>city<br>and uh inside there are um<br>in between 100 and 1500 residents at<br>between<br>120 175<br>families and there are a lot of kids<br>uh school-aged children in between 300<br>and 500<br>you can see from the pictures that i<br>selected that<br>obviously this building was not<br>completed<br>and also it was not meant to be<br>uh used for residential and then<br>what they uh the people obviously the<br>refugees they were on one side lucky<br>to have um a roof<br>and a place where to stay but they had<br>to do a lot of work<br>and they were helped by several ngos in<br>order to re-adapt<br>the um the location in order to create<br>this sense of<br>uh home and stability then the<br>i was looking at human action as a<br>significant component of a side<br>and also an important shape chapter of<br>the<br>ordinary everyday life because this is<br>what<br>makes the difference the ordinary and<br>everyday life<br>how people use and transform this space<br>going to the rural area and then<br>you can see in the in the map the<br>location and how they are all spread<br>all of these informal tentative<br>settlements they are all spread all over<br>the country<br>with certain areas that are more crowded<br>than others so for example there is all<br>the bega valley that is this<br>plane the agricultural plane the most<br>important of<br>lebanon where syrians<br>are um located in majority obviously<br>this is all the border with syria and<br>then<br>they um you know obviously this<br>and this part of lebanon are the easiest<br>and even nearby location for them to<br>to stay and and this is<br>where um the begawa live with some of<br>the<br>villages where they are<br>funding um on and where they are<br>settling<br>and i was looking at all the um<br>the the information the data that unscr<br>was able to collect in the past years<br>uh looking at the services<br>like toilet water and<br>schools um all the type of<br>infrastructures<br>that are um<br>were created for each of these informal<br>settlements<br>and you can see in these maps that are<br>reporting and depicting two of these<br>villages<br>in the ibega valley how many informal<br>settlements<br>are located in these small villages<br>then this is how they appear i mean<br>if this is the village they are all<br>spread<br>all this red they are all spread in the<br>rural<br>settlement and they have<br>as a border the the rural channel<br>to for the agricultural channels<br>or sometimes other natural<br>infrastructure then<br>there are some um some<br>thought that natasha quintero<br>was writing down<br>and they are related on how<br>we can integrate this planning uh um the<br>planning<br>planning and sustainable development<br>and how they can considered informal as<br>a part an important part of the<br>landscape<br>discourse and how the informal<br>settlement can engage in the<br>transformative processes that make<br>new urban scenarios then<br>while researching i started to be<br>interested in the concept of<br>humanitarian design<br>i mean this human<br>centered design strategy to address<br>the contemporary humanitarian challenges<br>and there are several<br>organizations that are working on that<br>and as<br>bruno mentioned before i'm<br>the part of one of this organization and<br>i'm<br>the chair of the international<br>federation of landscape artists that<br>working group<br>landscape attitude without borders but<br>then<br>while working and with this group and<br>researching<br>i discovered that there are so many um<br>agencies working with refugees<br>different levels and there are really<br>a series of network but<br>what about the landscape architecture<br>this is something<br>new i mean how and why landscape<br>architect<br>can contribute to the<br>migratory phenomena and how we can<br>we can intervene due to the fact that<br>the majority of these crises<br>are crises that<br>are continuous crisis they never stopped<br>then looking at what's the situation in<br>lebanon the fact that<br>we have informal tended settlement<br>residential building the substandard<br>buildings<br>in all of these uh what what<br>come um is that there is a lack of<br>planning and design<br>lack of infrastructure and services high<br>environmental depletion of natural<br>resources i mean there are a series of<br>problematics and looking at what<br>landscape planning and design can do and<br>type of work i try to<br>to select the typology of work<br>that are related to landscape planning<br>and design<br>that can contribute to<br>intervening these conditions<br>but i i will go a little bit fast and i<br>want to show you<br>some of the example and the<br>work that i have done with my students<br>mostly and this is for example a small<br>informal settlement nearby side<br>and it it's we worked<br>to implement uh some small intervention<br>by the end<br>we weren't able to implement anything<br>but it was<br>really an important work that we<br>conducted together as a community<br>service and service<br>learning and what we did the the<br>informal settlement<br>it's really small only 21 families<br>but with eight one children and<br>um the number of tens it's around<br>20. and this is the condition<br>and the settlement reality is really<br>in a lucky position because it's um in<br>the middle of a banana field<br>and um we brainstorm we add the<br>different brainstorming sessions and we<br>interrogate professors and<br>architects and also<br>ngos in order to understand how they are<br>or or how they intervene in similar<br>situation<br>but these students were not really<br>um i mean they were um<br>in crisis they were always asking me why<br>we have to work over there<br>and what's our role what what can we do<br>how can we<br>we had them it was clear for them that<br>there was a need to work with<br>kids but uh as for the rest they were<br>unable to see how to really give a<br>contribution<br>then what we did we we did a series of<br>field work to assess the area<br>and we had also semi um structural<br>interview with the<br>people with the community over there and<br>then<br>we decided to work in<br>four main categories border vegetation<br>children and water then the students<br>selected one of these topic and they<br>produced<br>several projects for example this is one<br>of the projects working on the board and<br>transforming<br>in inconsistent element in something<br>with a depth and in uh that is uh<br>with a functionality uh in order also to<br>create a space<br>where to gather and to spend time and<br>then<br>um this is a little bit more poetic<br>there was this idea of<br>of creating uh um gardens that were<br>and in the few trees that were<br>located in the camps<br>and this instead was more<br>thinking of the future imagining what<br>how to reconvert the place once<br>the camps will be destroyed and looking<br>at this face in between this narrow<br>space<br>in between the tents and the outside<br>that was also the place where the water<br>and then the the<br>first herbs used to grow<br>and thinking at the concept of trace and<br>time and transformation and obviously<br>there<br>was the warehouse project um working<br>with kids and<br>investigating the different activities<br>that they were<br>involved in and trying uh also to<br>imagine on how to transform it and how<br>to create something<br>more interesting for them then<br>with this project and also with other<br>projects we participated also<br>several um activities like again<br>a student's achieving engagement<br>conference and workshop<br>titled refugees and marginalized<br>community<br>in lebanon and egypt and the students<br>from<br>in these two countries were<br>working together and presenting the work<br>uh during the semester and we worked in<br>one area that is<br>really deprived and disadvantaged area<br>of beirut<br>and these students were imagining small<br>intervention<br>also looking at implementation working<br>with kids<br>working in order to create social<br>cohesion or working um with<br>agriculture in order to create space for<br>community that could be also productive<br>spaces<br>some years ago i was able to organize<br>this workshop<br>also thank you to the participation<br>of several professors coming from<br>different universities around the world<br>and uh this is the group there are a few<br>that are<br>missed in this picture but what's<br>important is<br>the fact that we we<br>we created a kind of community with the<br>people and the syrians living in this<br>informal settlement<br>and we are in barrelia's in the bega<br>valley<br>and this is how the situation evolved<br>throughout the years with the numbers of<br>intimate settlement that were every<br>year's coming<br>up and the methodology that could be<br>divided<br>in four parts i mean there was the first<br>part in which student<br>and professor brainstormed and created<br>the<br>um framework plan<br>identifying the problematic then the<br>word day by day<br>feedback and meeting with the community<br>that were divided in between<br>men women teachers and we had also unhcr<br>coming because he uh it was involved in<br>the process<br>and then finally we had this the um we<br>came up with this design strategy on<br>creating a network of gardens space<br>for um for looking at genders and<br>specifically<br>the women and the young the girls<br>and the infrastructural elements<br>then place for kids and the space for<br>kids<br>then we had the participation of the<br>community and they were giving feedback<br>every time we were implementing uh<br>the project and they were collaborating<br>with<br>us and by the end we were able to um to<br>construct to build<br>these four intervention and these are<br>the different phases with the<br>participatory approach<br>and the meeting with the community and<br>this is the<br>map there was a school<br>outside the informal settlement<br>and in red the three interventions the<br>pedestrian connection the children<br>playground and the water garden<br>and um here are some of the images<br>of team um the work that we were able to<br>to build together with the community<br>over there<br>specifically with the kids that were<br>always<br>let's say it was a moment<br>of experimentation after that<br>there were a series of more theoretical<br>events like forum or<br>um there is a research that i'm part of<br>that it's on horizon 2020 that is<br>looking at<br>migration but it's uh i mean let's say<br>that<br>i'm more interested in kind of in<br>interdisciplinary<br>our department the ldm<br>landscape component of the project and<br>it's enriching because we are learning a<br>lot and they are learning from us<br>on how to<br>intervene in the case of migration and<br>also working on<br>governance of migration<br>and then uh finally with a friend of<br>mine we were able to set up a chair and<br>nesco chair in a mediterranean landscape<br>in emergency<br>go it was last year but<br>due to the pandemic everything was fixed<br>then<br>we are involved then we have the<br>landscape act that without borders and<br>then we have other type of project<br>and also the participation of<br>the landscape arctic without border<br>groups who<br>um several other organizations like the<br>global alliance for urban crisis and we<br>are also partnering<br>with the architect without borders but<br>going back to beirut<br>after and during this experience with um<br>migration uh that i was really<br>interested something happened<br>in beirut and and<br>because we root is a country in which<br>social inequality and political unrest<br>are the the let's say<br>the everyday<br>conditions and lebanon as one of the<br>highest<br>wealth inequality ratios in the world<br>but suddenly uh last<br>year on october 17 something happened<br>and then the community and the people<br>the lebanese all together<br>started protesting and they went<br>to the street they were blocking the<br>street and there were a lot of<br>really difficult moment but<br>the majority of the case it was peaceful<br>and what<br>really interested me and<br>all the designers<br>looking at the phenomenon was the way in<br>occupied the void of the city center<br>and they created a new type of spaces as<br>you can see here in the pictures they<br>were working<br>they were doing yoga they were relaxing<br>they were discussing they were creating<br>in the road the sense of homeless a<br>collect<br>a collective space and this was for me<br>something new that i was<br>aiming for for several years since i<br>came to beirut and finally i was so<br>happy to see<br>that especially beyond<br>they were in in the street and they were<br>using the space<br>for public users and um<br>and there was an architect antoinette<br>allah<br>that created these interesting maps on<br>how the the central part of beirut<br>was occupied by the different groups of<br>protesters to conduct different<br>type of activities during all the days<br>there were<br>several activities organized in several<br>parts of the<br>city center and this was something<br>unusual<br>and what they created was this inclusive<br>space<br>and this welcoming to all the segments<br>of the society<br>and especially to the middle class i<br>deemed<br>under underprivileged class<br>and at one point there were<br>almost two millions people on the street<br>if you consider<br>that in lebanon there are four millions<br>um<br>people and then it it was something uh<br>really amazing and uh and<br>it was a moment of hope<br>and these hope and<br>is finally seeing people fighting for a<br>better future<br>but then the covey arrived and<br>um we went and locked down no matter the<br>numbers were really low back in march<br>and but we know about the<br>coronavirus and i will not stress too<br>much on that<br>but what's really matter to me and the<br>effect of<br>the pandemic on lebanon and how<br>created a lot of issues<br>and it was a layer of crisis on top of<br>other crisis the country<br>was passing through and it arrived<br>really<br>at a specific moment in which already<br>the country was<br>facing an economical and a political<br>difficult situation but no matter the<br>coronavirus the people were still on the<br>street<br>and they were protesting all united<br>and then some uh something happened<br>it was the 4th of august and<br>i was not in beirut um<br>and something really striking happened<br>and there was this<br>shock wave that destroyed<br>a big part a big portion of the city<br>and the you can see in the map the<br>the area then we are here this is the<br>the explosion was here and this was the<br>area that was most affected<br>versus the other and uh<br>and this um this explosion was<br>called by the prime minister as a great<br>national disaster and it's true<br>it's it was a disaster it's still a<br>disaster that we are<br>dealing with since august 4.<br>and if you see this map<br>in red is the area that was most<br>affected<br>but then um with the<br>orange and the light orange you can see<br>how<br>vast is the area that was affected<br>by the blast by the explosion<br>if you imagine that they live somewhere<br>here<br>and also the american university of<br>beirut<br>that is here was um<br>affected by the blast and it's really<br>far away<br>it was reported at the beginning that<br>there were more than<br>17 dead after the explosion and but in<br>reality the number of that<br>are um are increasing every day and<br>today<br>these are the numbers that they took<br>some<br>days ago but today reached 2014<br>and we are not sure about the number of<br>missing they say<br>seven but it seems that they they could<br>be also<br>higher and we have more than<br>6 000 injured people<br>and all the world react to this blast in<br>lebanon<br>and sending help<br>and donation everything and<br>and if you consider that there are 77<br>000 damaged housing units and and<br>300 000 residents that are um affected<br>and they think it's really huge but how<br>the community reacted on<br>one side they were protesting they were<br>fighting again on the other side you can<br>see how the youth<br>they were the first going and helping<br>and cleaning and organizing<br>every type of help donation food<br>in order to um to rise again<br>and that there was a lot of anger and a<br>lot of rage versus the government<br>and the there were also on all the media<br>that the lebanese people are resilient<br>and there was a lot of discussion<br>what this resilience is and there was<br>this<br>um kim<br>gatas that is a syrian fellow<br>that brought down that is true that they<br>are resilient but<br>lebanese fund solution to everything<br>it means that they don't solve the<br>problem from the rules and that this is<br>something<br>really important and<br>then our lebanon today i tried and this<br>is also<br>how i feel i mean i feel that um<br>we are going down down down and<br>and there is this set of multiple and<br>overlapping crisis<br>and you can ask yourself but<br>what's the meaning of all of these in<br>relation to landscape<br>architecture meaning is that these um<br>in this person in this image at least<br>zero percent interesting people<br>from the government it's it's true that<br>the community are able and that they are<br>showing that they can by themselves<br>rise again but does doesn't mean that<br>it's enough<br>and and what really mattered me is that<br>this explosion came in<br>in a particular moment of of a<br>difficult condition the country was<br>passing through<br>and the most affected people in lately<br>were<br>and as usual the<br>vulnerable segment of the lebanese<br>society and in particular the immigrant<br>workers and<br>refugees because they were<br>they were already a marginalized<br>community and they<br>found themselves in a really dark<br>situation<br>with really few options and if you<br>consider<br>that the majority of the immigrant<br>workers and refugees<br>they were um sorry i'll go fast because<br>i want to show you<br>where they were living and they were<br>just living in the area<br>where the the the blast<br>in the area that was most affected and<br>with the majority of syrians but also<br>people coming from<br>bangladesh from ethiopia from sudan<br>from egypt and and they<br>were the they are still the more<br>the most affected one and they<br>are asking in the majority of the case<br>to have food<br>and to have shelter and<br>medicament but<br>since i'm working with my students in<br>this area<br>and my students also they were asking me<br>but<br>how we can intervene what we can do in<br>this condition<br>we would like to help and the<br>communities need<br>but how we can intervene and also was<br>asked myself as a chair of landscape<br>active without borders<br>how i can intervene and i questioned<br>myself for two months<br>and still i<br>i thought that as a group<br>that is like doctors without<br>borders it seems that we have to<br>intervene<br>at the beginning when a crisis arise but<br>in reality i i still<br>didn't figure out how the emergency<br>and the how you can act in the<br>emergency at the beginning of the<br>emergency<br>um in in search of a multiple crisis and<br>i was looking in between<br>my um books and<br>my magazine and i founded this<br>number of 2011 of course crisis<br>landscapes<br>and it means that um the the crisis were<br>still there back to them and then<br>i have to say that um when um<br>last year in oslo uh<br>there was this um the launch of the next<br>e-class conference stop and think<br>um i thought that in reality this is<br>what maybe<br>i uh we need to do and what i need<br>uh in this moment i mean<br>it's kind of um taking time<br>and really think the the way we look at<br>the<br>crisis and the way we we used to<br>to uh understand and to react<br>uh as a designer and and to<br>look at really what we value what how<br>we can act and uh<br>specifically what what we can<br>live and and i was looking and<br>researching<br>uh um then there is nothing in relation<br>to<br>the conflict and the crisis<br>writing and rules on on the landscape<br>architect on how to move forward to<br>reduce the impact of climate change in<br>response to<br>natural disaster and the fact that we<br>have to work in<br>collaboration and we have to play a<br>clinical role<br>and etc but uh and we talked about<br>adaptation and mitigation we can use<br>the same word and the same concept also<br>in<br>in the case of multiple crisis and also<br>conflict but um<br>there is nothing uh specifically related<br>to that<br>also if i looked at the outline there<br>are things that are more related to<br>climate change<br>and uh the policies in relation to<br>climate change<br>i still believe that landscape is really<br>an essential component of the people<br>and in its true landscape that we<br>express our identity<br>and uh and we can the landscape<br>architect<br>actually assist in the<br>international aid through our uh<br>emergency disaster relief<br>fraud and sanitation control and<br>whatever<br>but um i wrote this<br>um a few years ago and honestly i'm not<br>sure that<br>this is still valid i mean i'm still<br>researching and i'm still<br>trying to identify what's um our role<br>in envisioning these scenarios uh uh<br>to respond to certain crises<br>and then i found that while reading<br>um this piece on the<br>place journal is<br>the is an article of<br>mice and friedman that it all is lost<br>north on broken world design all this<br>loss is so it's a<br>an interesting uh film that i suggest<br>all of you to go<br>and watch it and um<br>and it's true that maybe we have to um<br>rethink our way of um leaving us<br>the phenomena that we are living and<br>there is this um sentence that is taken<br>from<br>the rethinking repair by the computer<br>scientist<br>stephen jackson that say that an<br>appreciation of the real limited<br>fragility of the words we inhabit<br>and the recognition that many of the<br>stories and orders of<br>of modernity are in process of coming<br>apart<br>perhaps to be replaced by new and better<br>stories and order<br>but perhaps not and there is this<br>concept<br>of um of<br>uh this broken thinking<br>uh these broken words thinking<br>and um this<br>way of looking at the things through<br>design<br>and specifically uh<br>considering sustainability and<br>resilience<br>are still are<br>are we sure that this is the way we have<br>to<br>to move forward and uh or<br>we are still drinking circle in order to<br>perpetuate that is uh<br>assisting the existing order and<br>continue on the<br>thread meal of the modernity and<br>um this is um something that i'm<br>i'm still questioning myself and<br>i mean i i i<br>i believe on this broken world thinking<br>that this orientation that<br>um takes seriously the fragility<br>of the human uh the technical and the<br>natural worlds around us<br>and i will conclude with this that<br>with the sentence there is a crack in<br>everything<br>and that's how light gets in and<br>thank you very much and sorry if i i was<br>a little bit longer than i expected<br>was excellent thank you very much<br>gabriella for sharing<br>your work and your passion um<br>i think it's uh very timely<br>to listen to all of these and especially<br>with all the kobe disruptions this year<br>to really not really helping<br>most of those issues um<br>now it's time for questions um<br>and everyone is invited to<br>ask questions directly to gabriella and<br>don't forget to unmute yourself before<br>doing that<br>or if you feel a little shy you can<br>always type your questions in the chat<br>box<br>and we're gonna read it giving you some<br>time to prepare those<br>um i will just kick start with a very<br>quick<br>and potentially brief question um<br>looking at all the work you have done<br>with refugees and ethnic minorities in<br>what do we need<br>to know more as landscape architects<br>that we don't know at the moment<br>what will better prepare us to deal with<br>i think we have to move from the concept<br>of the design<br>and to start looking<br>and to wear different glasses i have<br>this<br>luckiness of wearing glasses and most of<br>the time i have to say that when<br>i'm i'm stuck i remove my glass<br>and i see things differently and this<br>help me<br>figure out things and and i have the<br>feeling that<br>the solution is more simple than<br>as we we think and we are<br>over um um<br>overthinking over doing<br>you know yes complicating things that<br>maybe are simple and this what i<br>discovered when<br>i was working with the practically on<br>the field<br>with the syrians together<br>everything was much simpler and<br>everything was<br>easy to solve it instead uh<br>we are here debating and there are all<br>of this<br>huge word and there are a lot of<br>political constraint<br>not economical constraint but read this<br>thinking and this political<br>understanding of the things that<br>is enable us to do the things that we<br>need to do<br>and um i i believe that<br>we have to start again and we have to go<br>on the field and we have to do to start<br>with this<br>ethnographic campaign and to start<br>communicating and<br>listening to the community<br>and everything will be much easier<br>great answer and we have a question from<br>thank you bruno thank you hi<br>hey that was great thank you so much<br>very very interesting and<br>um uh of course i was particularly<br>interested in this because i have family<br>in lebanon and beirut but i<br>i was what i really uh i guess i found a<br>bit of hope in because i know how<br>desperate the situation is there was<br>that fact that<br>um you know you talked about the october<br>uprising<br>and the fact that um you know you had<br>all these lovely grassroots<br>gatherings uh where this urban space was<br>being taken over<br>uh by communities with kind of these<br>amazing<br>um uh simple communal<br>and personal uh activities<br>uh and i was just wondering about<br>you know the the explosion then<br>uh as catastrophic as it is uh<br>but kind of also representing uh<br>the kind of need in a way not need but<br>the fact that lebanon has this kind of<br>complete meltdown<br>you know political social fiscal<br>um is i guess what i'm trying to say is<br>do you think there's a possibility to<br>engage with some of those things that<br>came up during the october<br>uprising as a way of um<br>you know uh being able to redevelop the<br>area<br>with these kind of pockets that were so<br>clearly<br>uh established during the uprising<br>because i'm i'm aware there's that you<br>know the the<br>the kind of the um the biggest architect<br>buildings that have gone in and the big<br>um kind of<br>very uh privately owned commercial<br>developments of public space that have<br>happened recently<br>but just wondering if you see any hope<br>in your wonderful um uh optimism that<br>you<br>you left us with at the end for for<br>some of these things that you noticed uh<br>during the october uprising to somehow<br>be integrated in the developments post<br>explosion<br>um look i have seen in the<br>i have seen the in the past month<br>that there are a lot of<br>cultural protests and the<br>and there is also sharing of awareness<br>in order for the people not to move not<br>to leave their houses<br>to recreate what's happening with solar<br>after the war then<br>this is giving us hope in order<br>for not to replicate uh what's happened<br>before<br>and to start<br>from um and to you know move everything<br>and start from scratch and i<br>think there are still people that are um<br>uh are interested and they they hope<br>that um the um the<br>test can at least<br>if not go at the governmental level at<br>the<br>level of the city can create some<br>changes<br>and i believe this will happen because<br>the<br>youth understood that they have a power<br>that they can do<br>things they were not aware that they<br>they could do it they they<br>are questioning certain things that<br>before<br>they they they were normal<br>and now they they understand that it was<br>not<br>and then i have this hope<br>and and i have this open in the<br>youth all these young<br>that went there just the day<br>the um the explosion happened to clean<br>and to help<br>then this is my hope and um<br>and that's why i i i competed with these<br>final sentence that there is a light<br>somewhere in every crack and<br>and i i really believe uh in the power<br>of people<br>in the power of the community i and<br>and i i feel that um<br>every revolution needs time and<br>um but something happened and<br>we can't forgive and they they will<br>remember<br>and they will um they will use it<br>and they will not a big change<br>but there will be uh small changes that<br>will be distributed all over this is<br>what i<br>i hope i answered your question<br>yes thank you very much thank you thank<br>you dorita<br>and thank you gabriella uh there is a<br>question from<br>hi maria how are you hi<br>finally i see you we're in touch bye<br>thank you for a brilliant temptation<br>extremely insightful and thank you for<br>bringing<br>bringing me back to these places where i<br>did my field work not so long ago<br>and for the beautiful work you did with<br>your students<br>and thank you also for<br>uh having the sense of place and<br>belonging that you talked about<br>uh regarding refugees that you develop<br>it<br>uh in my country and it's very touching<br>and for the message of hope that you are<br>giving me as a lebanese<br>uh i'm very very touched by your words<br>so thank you for that uh i have two<br>questions<br>for you the first one is um<br>is about your your approach<br>in the field work so how did you solve<br>the<br>ethical problems this power imbalance<br>between you as a foreigner researcher<br>university professor and the refugees<br>because i had some issues in this during<br>my field work<br>and the second question because my<br>research is about space appropriation<br>how do you create or help create<br>a sense of place and belonging in such<br>very vulnerable conditions and i'm sure<br>that the conditions<br>are even much more vulnerable today<br>than they were a couple of years ago<br>thank you<br>thank you father first of all for your<br>kind words<br>uh it's true that after eight years i<br>feel part of this country<br>and i really care about this place<br>and i i really hope that<br>at least with my work i was able to<br>give something to this company and<br>to be helpful as for the question then<br>the<br>ethical issue it's a really big shoe<br>while working<br>with certain categories<br>of of people and<br>first we were um we were selecting<br>um a camp a settlement in which already<br>the american university had some bound<br>and they were prepared they were<br>and we a kind of<br>connection then we went<br>in during winter we met the people we<br>did a tour then<br>we had a brainstorming led professors<br>they came from the different countries<br>and we met<br>and we did a tour we met several<br>international organizations<br>were working with syria and<br>we visited the different camps and then<br>um then it was not something that it<br>happens<br>you know then there was a preparation to<br>the<br>workshop and uh and once we were there<br>this day-to-day meetings with the<br>community was a way of<br>trying to understand and to to<br>not to impose things but to understand<br>really they need and it was really a<br>difficult thing since<br>they were um especially the men<br>they were asking for practical things i<br>need a passport<br>you can help me with the bureaucratic<br>things you know<br>instead the women were really at full<br>they really gave us a lot of evil<br>a lot of direction uh during the<br>brainstorming and the things but also<br>when we were implementing the work they<br>were with us saying god<br>do this it could be unsafe for kids<br>do it in this way we need peace you<br>can't<br>organize this in this way they really<br>working with us<br>and and this was really important<br>we tried really to to move<br>inside of the settlement without<br>creating too many um you know<br>changes and problems but<br>um also by the end<br>when we finished everything we organized<br>a day<br>in which with all the community we went<br>through all these spaces and we were<br>discussing<br>we were sharing um information they were<br>saying what they liked what they didn't<br>then like it's really<br>something of bonding uh uh<br>creating them uh link in between us and<br>then but often between them<br>because in most of the case they were<br>not communicating then<br>we tried not to impose the sense of<br>community in a space like that in which<br>you are forced to live with other people<br>that you don't know<br>and what we were able to live<br>in the case of the application and<br>creating this sense of<br>feeling of being at home<br>what we what happens is that<br>they they were asking for certain things<br>i mean we were planting things we were<br>creating<br>small gardens and they asked us<br>to have plants in order for them to<br>plant it<br>in this space inside of the cluster of<br>tents<br>and um uh i i didn't mention for<br>because there was no time but everything<br>was destroyed<br>um over there but it was not destroyed<br>by the<br>uh community it was destroyed by the<br>owner of the<br>of the land because all these<br>settlements<br>are built in private land and no matter<br>the fact that he was always with us he<br>was aware<br>he was keen to collaborate and whatever<br>but only to show that<br>he has a power for them and then they<br>have to be afraid<br>of taking certain decision then he<br>destroyed everything<br>but when we went again all<br>the person that<br>were working with us all the people that<br>were still there they were asking us to<br>come back again and they were showing<br>us how much they were able to organize<br>small garden<br>to organize small activities i mean we<br>empower in a way<br>also them and maybe we gave<br>some hope for um not for a future but at<br>least<br>for the time that they have to spend uh<br>over there<br>thank you thank you for your answer<br>i i call this in my thesis hospitality<br>hostile hospitality so they rent the<br>land<br>but they run the land for refugees at a<br>certain price which is<br>normally exploitation this is<br>thank you 15 um less questions from<br>hi gabriella hi larry<br>time i've got a couple of questions you<br>probably don't recognize me i go covered<br>beard<br>couple of questions comments perhaps in<br>two streams one has to do<br>first of all with with the refugees and<br>barleys and<br>italiano and all that stuff the other<br>one has to do with<br>what's happened uh recently with the<br>explosion in in beirut<br>um what unites my comments is that what<br>we have<br>in both cases is people who have<br>who are marginalized or have been made<br>marginalized<br>by circumstances for example the<br>explosion<br>right and these people are found they<br>find themselves in a uh<br>sort of a desperate situation right<br>that's not of their own making<br>and um there is at one level<br>the need you know that we have as<br>professionals and aid agencies and so on<br>to step<br>in and to fix it all up and i think<br>certainly there is<br>you know a role for that but the thing<br>that i find really interesting is that<br>there's<br>also a kind of a grassroots<br>energy that does things<br>in spite of everything that's happened<br>that's resilience<br>but in spite of everything that somebody<br>else might want to do<br>um the first time i i was with with<br>gabriella on on on the uh the<br>the project in in rebecca and and uh<br>you know the first time we went there i<br>think all of us professionals had sort<br>of an<br>idea of what we thought they needed<br>right you know we've done all our<br>research we've done all of our<br>our theory and stuff like that and then<br>we got there<br>and some of the stuff they done already<br>between our first visit and our second<br>visit<br>one of the discussions was you know<br>maybe they needed a worship space or<br>something like that well we got back and<br>you know what space had been turned into<br>a mosque hey how about that we didn't<br>have anything to do with that<br>the the the community was was<br>self-organizing<br>and i think there was a lot of that that<br>went on you know we stepped in<br>and i think that we had to become a lot<br>more humble<br>you know that we didn't know what was<br>the right thing to do i mean we could be<br>aware of the limitations<br>and what we could do is offer some<br>uh example i suppose of how to do it<br>you know and i don't think i mean we<br>were there at first they didn't<br>really know what we were there to do but<br>as they saw us working<br>as we talked to them a little bit more<br>you know i think that they kind of<br>bought into the idea<br>and then they ended up helping you know<br>and and i think they continued some of<br>that work after we left as well because<br>we left some equipment and stuff like<br>that<br>so what i'm thinking about all of this<br>is is that<br>you know a real key to some of this<br>stuff<br>has to do with not going in with big<br>ideas<br>but going in with a kind of community<br>engagement<br>that says okay as landscape architects<br>or architects or artists or engineers or<br>ecologists or whatever we are we have<br>some<br>tools that<br>we might be able to use in the right way<br>for the right<br>purposes for the people who kind of<br>decided themselves<br>um you know that's just one observation<br>i go to the observation about beirut and<br>i see sort of the same thing happening<br>you know the occupation in in not just<br>the you know<br>because of the the uprisings and so on<br>of all of those public spaces<br>and there's been a lot that's been<br>looked at in terms of everything<br>you know since tiananmen square you know<br>what the role is of public spaces<br>you know for community expression and so<br>on you know i see that i mean i<br>lived in beirut for a while i never saw<br>more than a half dozen people in martyr<br>square<br>and when i saw the images on television<br>of the thousands the tens of thousands<br>the hundreds of thousands of people<br>in that space i thought aha what we have<br>here<br>is not spaces that have been designed by<br>designers<br>these barter square is basically a ruin<br>the main statue has bullet holes in it<br>they're left over from from from the<br>from the uh the civil war<br>but what we have is people who are<br>taking<br>over the space for themselves now<br>what i wonder about though uh and there<br>is a lesson here too<br>at at the refugee camp the empowerment<br>of the people<br>an appropriate use of the term i suppose<br>by the owner<br>by the power it was basically able to<br>say okay we'll let you have it<br>but then we'll take it away the same<br>thing happened in beirut in another time<br>after the civil war solidaire took<br>the opportunity to create a brand new<br>city<br>away from the people and<br>created basically a real estate<br>development<br>and you know my wonder is how can<br>this power of the people so to speak<br>be maintained in this imbalance of power<br>that happens you know between the people<br>who have it<br>how can that energy that's in martyr<br>square<br>make a change um i'm not sure<br>sure that's gonna happen in lebanon um<br>you know uh true revolutions i think are<br>fairly rare uh and uh you know sometimes<br>catastrophic and you never know what's<br>gonna happen<br>on the other hand the devastation in<br>beirut has been horrendous<br>but other cities have responded and<br>built up wellington new zealand did that<br>after his earthquake um uh you know<br>there are all sorts of war-torn<br>countries that have done that and<br>you know so so i think that you know the<br>question of whether there's going to be<br>you know it's going to rise again i<br>think is a new question the question is<br>what's going to rise again and who is<br>going to be engaged in it<br>so i've been editorializing a little bit<br>but maybe i'll let you talk<br>gabrielle yeah thank you larry for<br>um for your um<br>comments and i agree with whatever you<br>mentioned<br>and you were with me and with all the<br>rest of the group<br>and uh yes it's true but what you<br>mentioned<br>as for beirut this is the question<br>nowadays i mean there is this um<br>um this reality<br>that they are only waiting<br>and something will be overpowering<br>the community and there will be this<br>reconstruction<br>that will change totally the<br>uh situation in the areas and<br>obviously there will be a relocation of<br>the<br>the more disadvantaged community that<br>we're<br>living over there and but<br>uh on the other hand um it's true that<br>uh during all of this here a lot of<br>changes<br>happened and a lot of lawyers also<br>were giving um uh<br>or they were putting their knowledge uh<br>and they were sharing all their thoughts<br>using all the social media<br>in order to help all the people that<br>were having and were passing<br>through several um legal issues<br>and then i i believe<br>that there is a change happening that is<br>a transformation in the air<br>and it cannot be if something will<br>happen it will not<br>be as a second solider it will be<br>different<br>what i'm expecting is that for sure all<br>the heritage buildings that<br>were present in the area they will be<br>first recovered and already they are<br>in the there are a lot of work going on<br>and there are a lot money coming and<br>donation<br>for the rest uh it will take a lot of<br>time<br>and in some cases there will be<br>you know this blooming of these huge<br>buildings coming up<br>but in other cases the situation<br>will be recovered and that there will be<br>this<br>still this sense of<br>the<br>if i have to imagine a scenario it's<br>mixed of<br>several things that will be combined<br>together<br>but it will not<br>i mean the explosion uh it will not<br>create again this um complete<br>tabula rasa but there will be a<br>combination of several things that<br>will cohabit together um<br>this is my feeling and also my hope<br>and um and<br>you know there are a lot that are really<br>um pushing uh in order uh<br>of things not to uh to be as before<br>also at the i mean the order of<br>involved i mean there are a lot of<br>giving us the hope that it will not<br>be as before but we cannot be sure<br>environment let's say this is a special<br>place<br>in with around a lot of complicated<br>conditions<br>and then<br>this is only what i i hope that<br>could be the future and what i'm working<br>also with my<br>students uh to imagine a better<br>condition for the future of the area<br>just one observation before i sign off<br>is by your map<br>the areas that were least destroyed in<br>beirut<br>are the areas where the palestinian<br>sabra and shadilah refugees camps are<br>yes<br>kind of ironic<br>that's true okay<br>thank you larry
