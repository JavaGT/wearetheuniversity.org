It's great to be with you guys.<br>Today, we want to speak about the Urban Planning <br>programme and it's two of our great students. We  <br>have Cas and also we have Annika from the third <br>year and the second year and we want to discuss  <br>about Urban Planning programme at the University <br>of Auckland and what the planning means and  <br>how we teach urban planning, you know, and <br>what potential opportunities you have in the  <br>future as a planner so it will be kind <br>of the discussion for today between us.<br>So, hi everyone. I'm Cas. I'm a third-year Urban <br>Planning student. I'm from Rodney College and just  <br>excited to show you guys a little bit about my <br>journey, my experiences at the University and what  <br>things I find important about planning and <br>my future, really. I think over to Annika.<br>Thank you. Hi, I'm Annika and it's <br>my pleasure to share my experience  <br>in Urban Planning with you guys. So, I <br>graduated from Macleans College in 2018  <br>and I am a second year Urban Planning student <br>and I think I have the passion to study Urban  <br>Planning because Urban Planning is <br>not only learning from the past,  <br>shaping our current society, but also we <br>are looking beyond the future as well.<br>Yeah, thank you very much, guys.<br>So, I think we need to speak about what <br>urban planning means. You know, it's a very,  <br>I think, challenging question. <br>It's a lot of debates, you know,  <br>about the planners and the role of the planners. <br>Planners traditionally, you know, try to  <br>shape the cities and towns, you know, to make <br>the cities more livable, you know, sustainable,  <br>and also address some malfunctions of the system. <br>As you know, we are more and more urbanised, you  <br>know, living in the major cities, so obviously we <br>are facing more problems and wicked problems here.<br>So as a planner we use our tools, critical <br>thinking and other tools. We have policy design  <br>and planning tools to address this kind of issue. <br>It includes the policy legislation, you know,  <br>politics, finance, economics, sustainable <br>environmental issues, cultural issues, heritage.  <br>So it's a range of things, even going to the <br>infrastructure, transportation, new technology.<br>So everything relates to the city or <br>urban living we are dealing with. And  <br>as you know, the dynamic is changing and <br>as Annika correctly mentioned that we  <br>are not thinking about the pre-existing <br>issues or just only the existing ones.<br>All the time, thinking about the future, how we <br>can shape the future of the cities and how we can  <br>improve the quality of life of <br>the people in the city here.<br>So it's my, at least my definition of planning, <br>you know, but we have an obviously we have a  <br>range of the definitions of the role of the <br>planners and urban designers in the society.<br>What do you think about that?<br>Yeah, so recently we actually had a talk of the <br>school and one of the definitions we had was the  <br>creation of place through the mediation of <br>space which was it really stood out to us  <br>and for me, coming from high school, one of <br>the interesting things about Urban Planning  <br>was just how broad it was. So I was very <br>interested in things like history, geography,  <br>design and this programme really brought all those <br>elements together. So I also started looking at  <br>Architecture, Geography with the University but <br>I really settled on Urban Planning because it  <br>combined all those elements together. It's just <br>about being curious, so at high school, I didn't  <br>really know about economics. I didn't do much <br>in politics, although I was interested in it,  <br>and the University and this programme <br>really helps you make all these connections  <br>and it doesn't matter about your past <br>experiences. It's about what you do now.<br>Urban Planning is just such an interesting degree  <br>because I studied geography and design <br>and technology in my high school  <br>and I feel like it's really setting me up really <br>well to study Urban Planning in university.<br>So in the first year of Urban Planning, <br>you'll basically be introduced to the course.  <br>You'll be introduced to a range of technological <br>services. You'll be introduced to Google SketchUp,  <br>AutoCAD, Illustrator and a range of services <br>available to all of us, really. And one thing  <br>that I found really helpful was the theory and <br>the history of urban planning and that kind of  <br>introduced us to urban planning law, governance, <br>economics and just shaped the course to set up  <br>for our second year and third year. And then for <br>first year we have such a great opportunity in the  <br>studio to work with our studio work and also <br>for economics and sustainable development we  <br>do have a lot of opportunity to learn new stuff <br>and to also draw and design our own development.<br>Guys, which project you enjoyed the most here, <br>you know, during the last couple of years?<br>My favourite project so far was from my first year <br>of Urban Planning so it was about redevelopment of  <br>a Grafton site right next to the Grafton <br>Campus of the University of Auckland.  <br>So I get to redevelop the whole site <br>by giving it up to more apartments,  <br>terraced housing, so changing all the <br>detached housing to more residential  <br>housing and apartments instead for all the <br>students living close by to the Grafton Campus.<br>My site that I really enjoyed redeveloping <br>was in Eden Terrace. We took the site,  <br>we looked through the whole history of the <br>site, how it developed alongside Auckland,  <br>the change, the cultural side of it and <br>then the things we wanted to apply for, say,  <br>sustainability, climate change and the type of <br>residence and the density we really wanted there.<br>The roles of the planner is a facilitator in <br>the society. We work with different types of  <br>people, groups, institutions, stakeholders, <br>you know. So we try to make connections between  <br>the different actors and also consider their <br>interests, especially when we are working with the  <br>communities, E.V.s, you know, we need to learn and <br>know how they think, what they want, not just what  <br>we perceive they need. So it's very good, actually <br>it's very important to know what they really want  <br>from us and how we want, because at the end we <br>want to facilitate and improve their lifestyle,  <br>not just impose something on them. So in that case <br>we need to work closely with the communities and  <br>understand their needs. Again, it's another layer <br>of the complexity for planners because we need to  <br>learn how to communicate with them, collaborate <br>with the communities. What do you think?<br>Yeah, so the urban planning discipline <br>it's very interconnected. You also have to  <br>consider the range of emotions <br>people have with their areas,  <br>iwi have with their cultural heritage. And you <br>take a high school, for example. The design  <br>of the high school, how it's interconnected, <br>its walkability, its connection to transport,  <br>how parents are actually going to drop off <br>their kids. It affects your everyday life  <br>and the urban planning discipline is very <br>interconnected to everything around us.  <br>So urban planning is actually not just focusing <br>on a neighbourhood or regional level. It is also  <br>about a national and a global level at the <br>end as well. It's a really collaborative  <br>space. You've got the 50 students you work with, <br>your tutors, your teachers all in that space.  <br>You sit around a table, you do your work together, <br>any questions. You get taught also in a variety of  <br>ways. So you have your lecture theatres, you have <br>your small tutor groups and then you can sit with  <br>your friends and do the assignments, like how <br>you're going to approach the assignment, yeah.<br>So how long will it take for you <br>guys to work on the, for example,  <br>studio one or lecture ones? How <br>much time do you spend on it?<br>So during your first year, you'll <br>have two semesters. You have  <br>four courses in each semester <br>with your General Education course  <br>and you'll have your two studio courses as well <br>and that's the collaborative one. And then you'll  <br>also have, say, three days a week where all your <br>lectures are and then you also have tutorial  <br>groups and tutorial spaces. And for me I would <br>definitely work in the studio for most of my time  <br>to work on my assignments or ask my classmates for <br>questions and then, yeah, it's very interesting.<br>As I know in your studio you have a <br>lot of facilities like a refrigerator,  <br>printers and everything, microwaves. You <br>have your tea kettle, your fridge, basically,  <br>that's where you spend most of your time and a <br>few late nights finishing assignments but yeah.<br>Nice. So you can definitely <br>spend a whole day in your studio  <br>and enjoy the day with your assignments.<br>The planning is quite an interesting, you know, <br>discipline because we are dealing with the very  <br>big, you know, issues and the problems we are <br>facing like climate change which is the kind  <br>of the traits for us and we try to address it <br>based on the plans and policies and also other  <br>issues like emerging technologies. We are speaking <br>more and more about autonomous vehicles, you know,  <br>augmented reality, virtual realities, so we are <br>using that kind of technology. But the difference  <br>between us and other disciplines like engineering, <br>when we are speaking about technology,  <br>for example, it's not just the technology <br>itself. We are speaking about the environment,  <br>community, and the human being as well. And some <br>other concerns like social justice, equality is a  <br>big issue for us. So we try to address the <br>issues in the existing condition and also  <br>in future and putting the right plans and <br>policies for the future as well. But I think  <br>our students they have a better sense about <br>how we cover it in the programme, isn't it?<br>Yeah, so like applying that to the real world and <br>the Auckland environment because we do study the  <br>Auckland environment. It's integral to our course. <br>And so one of the things we did was on Alfred  <br>Street with the planter boxes and that was a form <br>of tactical urbanism. So we reclaimed the street  <br>from cars for more walking space and just make <br>it a more livable community space, really.<br>And for our studio work we always get to work with <br>our Auckland-based location, so not just Auckland  <br>in general. So we can also base on our campus, <br>City Campus of the University of Auckland as well.<br>Based on the nature of the Planning programme, <br>we are all the time working with the communities  <br>and also we are going to the site visit. <br>It's not just sitting in the, you know,  <br>office or even in studio, which is quite nice, but  <br>it's not the only thing we do. So we do a couple <br>of the site visits working with the communities.  <br>I think our students they have a good experience <br>about that one. What do you think, Annika?<br>So we do have some field trips going to the <br>real-life examples so not just focusing on  <br>the environment itself. We also can find all the <br>real-life situations and real-life problems to  <br>deal with it. And also for our first year, our <br>urban design, we do have a lot of opportunities  <br>to go to Freeman Bay, for example, and then <br>study all the overall contexts in there.<br>You also have a range of opportunities overseas, <br>so I had the opportunity to go back to Holland  <br>and study at the University of Groningen. But <br>unfortunately, due to covid-19 that didn't happen.  <br>But there's a range of opportunities with <br>partnering universities overseas. You can go  <br>to North America, South America. You pay the <br>same fees and there's a range of scholarship  <br>opportunities as well, so it's a really <br>great opportunity with the university there.<br>Yeah, and we really support that kind <br>of move because this kind of experience  <br>will help our students to bring back their <br>experience from overseas so it can enrich,  <br>you know, their performance later <br>on and their action as a planner  <br>so they can bring that kind of <br>experience from overseas here.<br>And we have a great actual market <br>regarding to the Urban Planning programme.  <br>We have a good connection with the <br>private sector and public sector.  <br>Most of our students in third year and <br>fourth year they find internship positions in  <br>both private and public sector. So it's a great <br>opportunities, you know, and it's a range of the  <br>opportunities regarding to the diversity of the <br>skills they have to work as a transport planner,  <br>working as a consenting planner, policymaker, <br>strategists in the public sector. And also,  <br>you know, have the chance to work in the private <br>sector especially in the major companies and also  <br>smaller companies as well. I think Cas has a <br>good experience about that as a third year.<br>Yep, so in the third year, you get exposed <br>to a range of opportunities whether that's  <br>like Mohsen said in transport policy. There <br>are internships with Auckland Council that  <br>take you through different roles. You can <br>take different opportunities there with  <br>private enterprises as well. I had the privilege <br>of studying how alcohol affects public places as  <br>well, and how communities are impacted by alcohol. <br>And there was a range of decisions there from  <br>lawmakers. You read policy and there's a range <br>of community perspectives that were very helpful.<br>It's great to know that actually how the <br>high schools prepare you to, you know,  <br>to enrol in the Planning and how you <br>can find the connections between what  <br>you studied there and what you are doing <br>now in the Planning programme though.<br>Yeah, so I was very passionate in high <br>school about geography, history, economics,  <br>and also politics there, so that kind of <br>led me down the urban planning pathway.  <br>And there were also things due to climate <br>change, coastal erosion which I studied,  <br>the Australian bushfires, and that's all included <br>in the Urban Planning programme. And then I  <br>had a talk with my career counsellor and that <br>really led me down the urban planning pathway.<br>Yes, interestingly I've also studied geography <br>in my high school as well and the most I focused  <br>was on global warming and that is what we are <br>focusing on right now as planning students,  <br>to always focus on our environment and <br>to stay sustainable to our society.<br>In the Urban Planning programme here, we define <br>the role of the planners under problem solvers and  <br>one of the dimensions very important here <br>is creativity and innovation. So you know  <br>creativity and innovation, especially <br>for the young generation of the planners,  <br>urban designers, policymakers, <br>I think it's crucial, you know,  <br>to address the problems we are facing like <br>climate change, dealing with the technology,  <br>community and social justice. So in that case we <br>want to actually empower our students with a good  <br>understanding about the theory but at the same <br>time, you know, hands-on practice space kind of  <br>activities to address the issues. What do you <br>think? Do you think we achieve that or not?<br>Yeah, so exactly. So we use the theory and then <br>we build upon that so we'll take lessons from  <br>the past and we'll adapt the ideas, we'll put our <br>own spin on it, be creative in our own way, draw,  <br>use Google SketchUp, AutoCAD, <br>things like that to just  <br>produce our own ideas based on <br>lessons from the past really.<br>And it's a very lucky lesson for us <br>that we do have this opportunity,  <br>the only opportunity in New Zealand <br>to study urban planning here.<br>It's a big question why we should  <br>actually enrol in the Planning <br>programme at the University of Auckland. <br>As you know that the University of Auckland is <br>the highest-ranked between the other universities  <br>in the country so we are the first and we are <br>quite unique. And also we are actually the main  <br>trainer, educator of planners in the industry. So <br>around 50 to 60 percent of the planners trained by  <br>this School and in our programme in undergrad <br>and postgrad as well. What do you think guys?<br>As an urban planning student, we also  <br>have the unique studying environment in <br>our studio but also beyond from that.  <br>It is a degree that is recognised for New <br>Zealand planning institutions as well.<br>Yep, and our lecturers are leaders in their <br>fields from a wide range of backgrounds with  <br>a vast array of experience and they're <br>also leaders in their fields and they  <br>have ties to the industry which is really <br>helpful for when we enter the industry.<br>And the last thing I should add, you know, we have <br>very good connection with the other institutions,  <br>planning institutions around the world. So <br>when our students graduate they can easily  <br>work in Australia, Canada, UK and most <br>of the European countries as a planner  <br>so their qualification is recognised over there. <br>And nowadays we are working with the American  <br>colleges to actually qualification recognised <br>by Americans as well so our students can work in  <br>the United States later on. So it's a lot of, you <br>know, good positive things, you know, to be part  <br>of this programme. Regarding to employability of <br>planners, because we cover a range of the topics  <br>and we learn a lot of skills so we can easily <br>fit in the different type of positions, you know,  <br>as a transport planner, landscape planner, land <br>use planner, urban designer, policy analyst.  <br>And most of our students, you know, they can <br>easily find a job later on in the public sector  <br>and the private sector. Public sector can be <br>central government organisations or agencies like  <br>MBIE or NZTA or can be like a local government, <br>Auckland Council, Auckland Transport, you know,  <br>that all the time they offer very good <br>opportunities for our students you know to work  <br>there. But at the same time, you know, we have <br>very good markets regarding the private sector.  <br>As a Director of Programme, all the time I receive <br>emails from the companies and they ask for the  <br>good students to join their crew over there <br>and, you know, work for them as planners.  <br>So I think from the third year to fourth year <br>most of our students you know they find very good  <br>job opportunities and they can easily improve <br>their positions there and the salary is quite  <br>good as well in comparison to the other ones. You <br>know, most of the time you start from the 65,000,  <br>you know, from the junior planners and then <br>rise quite rapidly to around the 100,000 after  <br>three or four years, you know, for good planners, <br>which is quite challenging for companies,  <br>but it's good for our graduates. But at the same <br>time, the job opportunity is not just limited to  <br>New Zealand context. Most of, or some of our <br>students, they find job overseas in Australia,  <br>Canada, in China because our focus is based <br>on the sustainability, sustainable design,  <br>community so they are quite unique in the market, <br>global market so they can easily find good  <br>positions in the global market as well. If you <br>are passionate to change the future, to address  <br>the issues, engage with the society, you know, I <br>think that Planning is the right place for you.<br>So it's all about being curious. So <br>in high school, I didn't know too much  <br>about economics or politics, but I was very <br>interested in those subjects and it doesn't  <br>matter about what your past experiences are.<br>The University really helps you and prepares  <br>you for the industry so it's all about what you <br>do now and what you plan to do in the future.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
