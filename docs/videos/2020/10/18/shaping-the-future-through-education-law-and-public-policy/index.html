webinar we'll be talking about<br>how we can shape the future through<br>educational<br>education law and public policy<br>now um just before we do get started um<br>there is a q a function so feel free to<br>pop any questions that you have<br>whatsoever<br>um on the q a at the bottom of your zoom<br>screen there and we will have a section<br>at the end of that<br>um to go through those um now if we<br>don't reach<br>everything we will have a copy of those<br>questions and we'll get back to you<br>within the next week or so um<br>now we also will be having a little bit<br>more of audience engagement and we'll be<br>having a<br>um a little poll that goes up shortly uh<br>one of my colleagues will pop that up<br>in the next couple of minutes um which<br>will just assess kind of where you're<br>tuning in from<br>and uh what your current background is<br>and if you work within any of these<br>areas<br>i can see that the polls have popped up<br>there um<br>so feel free to choose uh choose one of<br>those which is applicable to you<br>and then also another polling question<br>which is um<br>based on your current knowledge around<br>the un's sustainable development goals<br>which will be a key focus of today's<br>uh today's webinar now before i<br>uh introduce our expert panelists that<br>we have this afternoon or this morning<br>or this evening depending on where<br>you're<br>tuning in from i'm just going to give a<br>brief overview of the university of<br>auckland<br>so uh you may or may not know but new<br>zealand has eight<br>universities um in the country and the<br>university of auckland is new zealand's<br>largest<br>of those eight universities with eight<br>of those eight universities<br>with forty two thousand students and<br>over five thousand staff<br>and we're um specific to this webinar<br>it's important to note that we are<br>ranked number one<br>uh in the country for um the times<br>higher education in qs rankings from<br>both 2019<br>and 2020 and that leaves us at the 81st<br>globally<br>in terms of the qs world rankings of<br>universities<br>now like um auckland as a city<br>uh we also have a very very diverse<br>student and staff base<br>so we have over 8 000 international<br>students studying with us at the<br>university of auckland and from 120<br>different different countries there so<br>you can be sure very similar to<br>the city of auckland which is one of the<br>most diverse<br>cities in the world culturally diverse<br>the university of auckland also mirrors<br>that within our student and staffing<br>base we're also the highest ranked new<br>zealand university for graduate<br>employability now this goes hand in hand<br>with new zealand's<br>position of being able being best place<br>to<br>um provide students with um what they<br>need for jobs of the future so educating<br>for future there's a statistic that i<br>heard recently that there's<br>around about 60 of of uh children that<br>are in schools<br>at the moment are going to end up in<br>jobs that don't currently exist yet<br>which is<br>equally as exciting as it is scary but<br>an education at the university of<br>auckland will be able to prepare you<br>and prepare you for um<br>for employment post graduation now i<br>will just go<br>over the uh eight faculties of the<br>university of auckland um so we have<br>eight faculties in the university of<br>auckland and over 200 programmes from<br>all the way through from foundation<br>options to undergraduate bachelor<br>degrees<br>to graduate diplomas postgraduate<br>certificates postgraduate diplomas<br>masters and the doctoral level so the<br>full<br>the full range there now those programs<br>are split<br>over eight different faculties at the<br>university of auckland<br>so uh we have the faculty of arts uh of<br>which we do have a representative<br>um of the faculty of arts with us uh<br>today who will introduce in just a<br>moment<br>we have uh the faculty of business and<br>business<br>economics again with a few different<br>specializations that you can<br>work towards there in accounting finance<br>management and international business<br>we have the faculty of creative arts and<br>industries which is one of the faculties<br>that i look after specializing within<br>architecture<br>urban planning fine arts music dance<br>design<br>and also the faculty of education and<br>social work again we do have a<br>representative with us today on the<br>panel<br>who will be able to talk a little bit<br>more about that and the stuff that we're<br>doing within<br>educational leadership the faculty of<br>engineering uh you may be<br>um noting a theme here that there is<br>lots of different specializations within<br>each of the faculties and<br>engineering is no exception we have the<br>uh<br>if students want to specialize within<br>civil structural mechanical<br>software even robotics and aerospace we<br>have options for those students<br>we also have the faculty of law again<br>where we're joined with the<br>representative<br>today from the faculty of law the<br>faculty of medical and health sciences<br>which as the name suggests<br>specializes within medicine public<br>health health promotion<br>pharmacy nursing and the like and then<br>we also have<br>one of our large faculties at the<br>university of auckland is our faculty of<br>science and very similarly<br>to the faculty of arts the science is<br>kind of an umbrella term and there's<br>lots and lots of different<br>specializations that students can choose<br>to studying all the way from chemistry<br>to<br>computer science to information<br>technology management to psychology<br>uh really there's the the full um the<br>full lot there<br>now if you um we will be sending these<br>slides through<br>um as we after we finish um probably uh<br>tomorrow or early next week<br>uh and so you can see at the bottom of<br>this page that there is if you do want<br>to get some further<br>information about any of the faculties<br>or any of the course offerings<br>um at the university of auckland i<br>encourage you to go on that website it's<br>a very comprehensive website<br>and you'll be able to find out some more<br>information there<br>what's important to note um here as well<br>is that today we've got<br>representatives from the faculty of arts<br>the faculty of education and social work<br>and the faculty of law uh next week<br>we'll have<br>the uh international webinar webinar um<br>on shaping the future through medical<br>and health sciences<br>and the faculty of science and then the<br>following week after that on the<br>29th of october i believe we'll have<br>another webinar which focuses on<br>business innovation<br>creative arts and industries and design<br>and engineering as well<br>so be sure to register if not already<br>for those to get a little bit more<br>information about that<br>now moving to this uh next slide here um<br>the university of auckland is also<br>a very internationally connected<br>university so we have<br>over 180 partners in 45 different<br>countries<br>the university is a member of three<br>consortium of research-led universities<br>so universitas<br>21 the association of pacific rim<br>universities<br>and the world universities uh network<br>now what this means is that it supports<br>our cooperation and exchange agreements<br>with over 150 different universities<br>uh in the world so students in a regular<br>year<br>would be able to then take exchange<br>opportunities and study abroad<br>opportunities<br>with some of our partners there it also<br>means that we have a very extensive and<br>global<br>alumni network and a strong platform for<br>international research and collaboration<br>and oversees opportunities there now<br>moving through to the next slide<br>um we do just want to touch upon and<br>this is within the poll as well<br>uh is the sustainable development goals<br>um set by the<br>un now the university of auckland is<br>very very proud to be the number one<br>university in the world for sustainable<br>impact<br>as rated by the times higher education<br>university impact rankings now there's<br>17<br>sustainable development goals often<br>referred to as sdgs<br>and we'll be touching upon a few of<br>these uh on today's webinar<br>and what this does is um it recognizes<br>our commitment to sustainability<br>and making a positive social impact<br>through research teaching and knowledge<br>transfer<br>so we'll talk a little bit more in<br>detail about those uh<br>within the next hour okay so now<br>uh the reason that you're all here today<br>is obviously to hear our um<br>expert panel uh on on their uh insights<br>there so today<br>i'm joined by dr anna hood from the<br>faculty of law<br>um anna is an associate dean<br>international and senior lecturer at the<br>university of auckland and has a<br>um a specialization within international<br>and disarmament law<br>we have dr john morgan from the faculty<br>of education and social work he's the<br>head of school for critical studies and<br>education<br>and has a specific focus on human<br>geography and then we also have dr<br>tim fagin from the faculty of arts as<br>well and also a member of the public<br>policy institute which i'm sure he'll<br>talk a little bit more about<br>um in the uh in the next hour and his<br>associate director postgraduate programs<br>at the faculty of arts<br>uh to the right i should introduce<br>myself that's the law me<br>um i am the international manager for<br>the faculty of education and social work<br>uh and creative arts and industries here<br>at the university of auckland<br>but my role today is to be the moderator<br>the host the spirit guide throughout the<br>this<br>panel discussion now last but not least<br>we also<br>do have a very special guest with us<br>today we have an alumni guest speaker<br>mr min trong um who is a master of<br>public policy alumni so the same program<br>that dr tim fajan<br>teaches on and is a new zealand asean<br>scholar recipient<br>and is currently working within the<br>consulate general of canada in ho chi<br>minh city saigon vietnam<br>and so it'd be great to hear both the<br>academic and the student<br>insights uh in the next um in the next<br>hour<br>okay so without further ado um if i<br>could ask my academics to make sure that<br>they've got their mics<br>uh turned on um so we often<br>we often think of sustainability in<br>terms of environmental sustainability<br>and climate change but there are many<br>other dimensions to sustainability<br>what is sustainability what does<br>sustainability mean to you<br>and why do you think it's important to<br>question the traditional thinking about<br>sustainability if i could get um<br>tim dr tim fagin from the faculty of<br>arts to to lead this question and then<br>kiara thanks ben um well i<br>i think with this question just to get<br>the ball rolling<br>we tend to think of sustainability as<br>something related to the environment<br>but throughout most scholarship and<br>academics tend to look at it as<br>involving also<br>the elements of society and the economy<br>and the principle asks us to consider<br>how we can ensure<br>that the things we enjoy today are there<br>for those who come after us<br>and how we might extend those benefits<br>to others<br>and so it's an important part of that<br>question that we be in a position<br>to evaluate and re-evaluate the notion<br>of sustainability<br>because the categories themselves are<br>variable citizens must determine the<br>proper balance of them<br>striking the balance should be based on<br>the best evidence<br>that we have uh and and decisions have<br>to arise<br>from the citizenry a fully engaged and<br>informed<br>citizenry to help us make more<br>and better policy decisions<br>great thank you so much for your<br>insights there uh tim john would you be<br>able to weigh in<br>um on that as well so what does<br>sustainability mean to you and why do<br>you think it's important to question<br>those traditional thinkings around uh<br>sustainability<br>well i think i'd sort of thank you uh<br>thank you ben and kia ora<br>um i think i i'd sort of go along with<br>what what tim has just<br>spoken about uh the the sort of a wider<br>definition<br>of what sustainability entails i think<br>for me as an educator<br>i i think the word is is often means<br>everything to everybody it's one of<br>those portmanteau terms that can sort of<br>satisfy everybody<br>who can be against sustainability and i<br>think for me as an educator one of the<br>key<br>challenges is to try to dis distinguish<br>and discern<br>different meanings of the term so just<br>to give two examples one one would be<br>um when we often talk about<br>sustainability we talk in terms of<br>technical solutions either technologies<br>or<br>management systems in order to make a<br>more sustainable world<br>and i think they they tend to be very<br>human centered the other<br>other angle from that would take a more<br>eco-centric<br>approach which starts with the earth<br>first they lead to very different<br>conceptions of what type of society<br>and what type of economy and what type<br>of ecological base we'd be using<br>so i think sort of i'd sort of add to<br>tim to say<br>we just need to sort of discern<br>different meanings of the term and try<br>to unpick those<br>fantastic thank you so much john there<br>and and turning over to<br>uh anna um from the faculty of law<br>um considering your discipline and your<br>on your background within<br>um law specifically international law um<br>what do you think are some of the<br>most important global challenges that<br>we're going to need to address in the<br>next five to 25 years<br>thanks so much ben and kira koto it's<br>lovely to be joining you this afternoon<br>um so there are so many big um global<br>challenges that<br>um those of us in the law faculty are<br>thinking about and working on<br>in the area of international law um<br>obviously climate change<br>and environmental issues um they're a<br>huge<br>um issue that we're um working on and um<br>trying to get action around there are<br>also big issues<br>around local migration we have over 70<br>million people<br>worldwide who have been forcibly<br>displaced from their homes and so<br>international lawyers spend a lot of<br>time thinking about how do we provide<br>protection to those people and pathways<br>to<br>places where they'll be able to be safe<br>and re-establish their lives<br>and there are lots of different other<br>areas from human rights to poverty<br>to trade but i think one other sort of<br>key issue<br>in the international system at the<br>moment that really underpins<br>all of the different big substantive<br>areas<br>is the extent to which the general<br>international system<br>is working well we've seen in the last<br>five years or so<br>quite a lot of different countries<br>walking away from international<br>organizations<br>whether that's the world health<br>organization or the world trade<br>organization<br>countries are more hesitant about<br>signing up to international treaties<br>and so we've got a bit of a legitimacy<br>crisis in the system at the moment<br>and there are some good reasons for that<br>there have traditionally been<br>quite a lot of problems in the system<br>but it's also concerning and i think<br>in the next five to 25 years we're<br>really going to have to work hard<br>on designing a system and<br>reconceptualizing a system that works on<br>everyone and ensures that we can really<br>tackle<br>the many different issues that exist<br>thanks thanks anna there for your<br>insights um tim would you be able to<br>also tackle that question so maybe from<br>the public policy standpoint<br>what you think is some of the most uh<br>important global challenges that we're<br>going to need to address in the near<br>future<br>thanks ben yeah i'm i think anna<br>identified uh many really important uh<br>issues um just to sort of recap a couple<br>and climate change obviously something<br>we've already kind of alluded to<br>incoming inequality and economic growth<br>uh but also<br>uh to another of her themes government<br>accountability<br>democratic issues including citizen<br>participation<br>so recently the oecd had put out a<br>report<br>that's projected massive shifts in<br>economic activity to emerging economies<br>including many countries throughout asia<br>and with the global share of gdp in<br>these countries<br>being projected to outpace those of the<br>of the oecd by 2060.<br>so if we think about these uh<br>themes in the context of sustainability<br>we have to think about what<br>challenges are likely to emerge on from<br>a public policy perspective<br>and in citizen engagement and what<br>skills do we need<br>as practitioners as researchers as as<br>students<br>and others to address them<br>we we certainly will need to to<br>to again to echo some of anna's uh<br>comments<br>a strong global network of like-minded<br>professionals<br>um these are often forged<br>at the university during studies<br>and in the interaction between<br>researchers<br>students and the practitioner<br>communities<br>and we need to consider how economic<br>growth is being done and<br>whether it's being done sustainably<br>keeping in mind the balance of<br>of the environment and the societal<br>aspect that we mentioned<br>earlier and if we don't<br>we end up with situations in which<br>there's a high degree of social<br>dislocation<br>sustained in economic inequality damage<br>to the environment and all of the social<br>impacts that these have<br>again uh anna's alluded to this as being<br>in the context now<br>and many uh projections have that being<br>an ongoing issue<br>that are going to require our constant<br>attention and engagement in the years to<br>come<br>thanks thanks tim um john would you also<br>be able to<br>make any additions on that um perhaps<br>from from your background<br>neither educational leadership or human<br>geography<br>well i think in terms of um in terms of<br>the list of issues which are<br>sort of been mentioned by anna and tim<br>um<br>i i won't go over those again but i<br>think in terms of education<br>there's a question which i think is is<br>broadly has to be framed in this way is<br>that for most of the last 70 years<br>education has been undertaken with the<br>assumption that the world is going to be<br>on an upward curve is going to be<br>increased in terms of levels of<br>globalization<br>and that the sort of prospects for a<br>better world and a better life for<br>future generations<br>um is sort of taken as read i think we<br>are facing<br>and the last six months have become very<br>sort of apparent to this<br>the possibility that environmental<br>climate change<br>um pandemics economic shifts may mean<br>that we live in a much more precarious<br>society so the question i'm interested<br>in<br>is for me as an education is how can we<br>as a society and how can we as<br>as a world in the sense learn to to live<br>on the planet we're at and i think<br>that's the broadest frame<br>and it's not just to do with education<br>it's to do with all disciplines<br>represented here today and<br>in the next couple of weeks too so<br>that's the broad question societal<br>learning<br>and how do we how do we make the world<br>sustainable to live on<br>well that's that's a great question uh<br>john and we've obviously heard<br>um a little bit about the the different<br>issues that uh are gonna be important to<br>address but but<br>sticking with you uh john what role do<br>you think universities<br>should or can play uh within addressing<br>these challenges<br>is how can we help well i think my sense<br>here is<br>is then this is i speak for myself um<br>education<br>universities tend to to be all things to<br>all people<br>they they in many ways they satisfy<br>individual needs for<br>uh meritocracy and for advancement and<br>achievement and for economic<br>um well-being um yet at the same time<br>they also<br>try to aim the type for the types of<br>social and citizenship goals that tim<br>alluded to in an earlier answer<br>in a way now one of the questions is how<br>far those are compatible<br>and which of those head which of those<br>lead<br>in a way so i think universes at the<br>moment are part of a sort of a reset<br>around trying to decide what are the<br>societal values<br>what are the goals and what are the aims<br>of where we're trying to head in the<br>next 15 to 20 years<br>and what types of skill sets what types<br>of dispositions what types of<br>competencies<br>and say what types of knowledge are<br>required to make that a reality<br>um so i think universities were going to<br>play a central role in in the in the<br>reset<br>which is taking place post covid yeah<br>i'm sure that um<br>all our panelists would agree uh with<br>you with you there<br>john uh tim would you be able to to<br>build on that on<br>um maybe from your your perspective what<br>role universities can<br>uh have in addressing the challenges<br>that we've identified<br>yeah um thanks ben um i think uh john<br>put it really well i<br>i hadn't thought of it that way before<br>but uh this reset<br>it's a really uh nice way to put it<br>because<br>um tied into this conversation today are<br>questions about values<br>uh in society um and the<br>how society arrives at the sort of<br>allocation of resources<br>and deciding and determining the sort of<br>society we want to live in<br>um it depends on having a strong<br>evidence base<br>and people who are given uh or sort of<br>develop<br>the necessary analytical skills in order<br>to make those decisions<br>so universities play a central role in<br>that um<br>and how we address these challenges so<br>we need to focus<br>on and do educating and training<br>students to be leaders<br>in their respective fields communities<br>internationally<br>we are working to equip students here<br>well i shouldn't say equip them with<br>curious minds they come in with those<br>but hopefully through our courses they<br>develop those things a bit more<br>uh and we equip you with<br>analytical tools to confidently make<br>smart<br>informed decisions so that you can<br>anticipate<br>challenges and also<br>work through solutions to them working<br>uh through that so that's part of the<br>teaching model we have here at the<br>university<br>uh which i'm happy to be a part of is<br>this research-based model so we're<br>active researchers<br>who bring in our own research into the<br>classroom to try to stimulate these<br>sorts of discussions<br>and approaches to problem solving great<br>thanks for your insights there<br>um anna thanks so much<br>um so fantastic answers from john and<br>tim to build a little bit more on them<br>um in terms of the classroom in addition<br>to the wonderful things tim's just been<br>talking about<br>in the law school we're really committed<br>to<br>providing all students from all<br>different backgrounds access to<br>understanding about the law and how it<br>works and how it can contribute to<br>solving<br>some of the big issues we face as a<br>society so some of our degrees<br>train you and your years about post<br>degrees<br>coming in we're doing some post-grad<br>programs such as our<br>master of legal studies where people who<br>have been out in the in other<br>professions can come in and get a taste<br>of the law and<br>a bit of an understanding and so we're<br>very focused on ensuring that a whole<br>range of people can get access<br>to information and new ways of thinking<br>about some of the big problems<br>we also put a lot of emphasis on giving<br>our students in addition to<br>having them question and develop<br>analytical minds<br>giving them exposure in the field so we<br>build in<br>opportunities for internships exchanges<br>that have already been mentioned<br>and a chance to really participate in<br>some of the big issues going on<br>and i think that one of the strengths of<br>auckland law school is that we have<br>a number of academics about a lot of<br>architecturally in addition to their<br>academic research and teaching<br>are also involved in<br>work in the real world and so a lot of<br>our faculty members<br>are involved in big negotiations um on<br>international issues advising<br>governments helping civil society actors<br>um so it's a really vibrant place to be<br>um and quite an exciting place to be<br>right now<br>as we're thinking about how we go<br>forward in the next couple of decades<br>thanks thanks alan thanks tim and john<br>for<br>uh your answers there now now sticking<br>with you uh anna for this next uh<br>question so<br>uh i know you work in international law<br>uh can you tell us a little bit more<br>about your work in this area and what<br>role international law can play in<br>helping the global community<br>um shape a more sustainable future<br>sure so international law when it comes<br>down to it i think is really<br>this is two key things that it's trying<br>to do<br>on the one hand it's a mechanism for<br>different<br>countries and groups to come together to<br>try and work out<br>how we deal with big global problems<br>like climate change and migration and<br>refugee issues<br>and another second part of it is that we<br>want to come up with mechanisms where we<br>can resolve big international disputes<br>peacefully so that we don't end up<br>with countries going to war against each<br>other so those are sort of the two<br>key things that international law is<br>trying to do solve<br>problems and come up with solutions and<br>stop us having major disputes<br>and i think historically um and even<br>today in some ways<br>international law at times hasn't always<br>been as helpful as we might like to<br>think it is<br>so there's a long history of<br>international law<br>at times actually being part of the<br>problem and creating some of the issues<br>that we see<br>around the world today so to give you<br>just one quick example<br>with the 70 million people who are<br>displaced<br>part of the problem and part of the<br>reason we've got that issue is that our<br>international system just doesn't<br>provide<br>sufficient pathways for protection for<br>people who may have been<br>displaced because of climate change or<br>disasters or famine<br>um so when working in fish law it's a<br>really<br>it's a really interesting space to be in<br>at the moment because<br>um there's a lot of promise in<br>international law and what we can do and<br>there's a hope of trying to solve things<br>but we've also got to tackle some of the<br>inbuilt issues that exist within the<br>legal system already so<br>um it's a fascinating area to engage<br>with<br>thanks anna and you've touched on uh<br>this next uh question<br>uh a little bit in your answer that you<br>just provided then um<br>but uh tying it into the sustainable<br>development goals that we were talking<br>about before so the university of<br>auckland is placed seventh<br>in the times higher education impact<br>rankings for the research contributions<br>to the un sustainable development goal<br>number 16 so peace<br>justice and strong institutions um anna<br>would you be able to tell me<br>how uh the auckland law school is<br>contributing to this work<br>and why you believe it's to be important<br>absolutely so there's a whole lot of<br>different things going on in the law<br>school<br>around ideas of peace and justice<br>and building up institutions both<br>domestically<br>and internationally so in terms of some<br>of our academics<br>who are actively involved in this kind<br>of work associate professor truster<br>dunworth<br>has done a huge amount of work in the<br>last decade<br>around nuclear disarmament issues and<br>has been actively involved at the united<br>nations<br>advising on nuclear weapons treaties<br>and helping to negotiate them professor<br>jane kelsey has done a lot of work<br>on trade initiatives and working with a<br>number of different developing countries<br>around the world<br>to provide them with support when<br>they're going into trade negotiations<br>and just one more example there are many<br>i could give but associate professor<br>claire charters<br>is one of the world's leading experts on<br>indigenous rights and she's done a huge<br>amount of work with the united nations<br>and also with the new zealand government<br>around how do we provide<br>better protection for indigenous peoples<br>throughout the world so that's what the<br>academic gives you a bit of a taste at<br>the academic level<br>with our student level we've also got a<br>lot of different student programs where<br>our students can get in got involved and<br>engaged with initiatives<br>to further peace and justice ideas one<br>of the<br>biggest student clubs that we have is<br>our equal justice project<br>which is a student initiative where<br>students are involved<br>in going into different legal<br>organizations community organizations<br>providing pro bono free legal advice<br>they're also very actively involved in<br>advocacy issues around<br>climate change and refugee issues so<br>there's lots and lots going on and i<br>think<br>it's wonderful that that's been<br>recognized um by the times higher<br>education<br>um rankings um because it really there's<br>lots of innovation and interesting<br>things happening<br>great yeah um so sticking with the<br>sustainable development goals uh but<br>moving over to uh<br>john now and for more of a education uh<br>and social work<br>um uh aspect so the university<br>of auckland is united nations um<br>academic impact hub for sustainability<br>goal number four<br>relating to quality education john would<br>you be able to tell me<br>um what is the faculty of education and<br>social work doing that is notable in<br>this space<br>and how can it make an impact here both<br>domestically and<br>overseas well thanks so then i think one<br>of the first things to say<br>is that sort of um there's no room for<br>complacency that sort of being<br>number one if you like on a particular<br>goal doesn't mean you just sit back and<br>relax<br>there is plenty to do so one of the<br>things i would say is i think there<br>are the way i conceptualize what happens<br>in our faculty<br>education and social work is in four<br>areas<br>all of which i think i want to put the<br>word transforming around<br>so the notion of transforming prosperity<br>and the definitions of what it means to<br>give a good life<br>as i intimated earlier there's a sense<br>in which living the good life is not<br>just only about<br>gaining high incomes and secure jobs and<br>so on if they're there<br>it's about well-being and health so we<br>have people working with broad notions<br>of health and well-being<br>within our faculty it's one of our sort<br>of our areas things with that is a<br>notion of transforming people<br>that what it means to live in our world<br>is to grow up<br>and to be educated is changing and<br>there's a sort of attention to<br>um the notions of diversity of living in<br>an inclusive society we have the sort of<br>black lives matter which is a global<br>movement<br>which is impinged on new zealand too we<br>have um indigenous rights and so on are<br>all about the types of lives that people<br>live as people<br>my third the third area i would identify<br>would be transforming<br>uh transforming knowledges the notion<br>that particular forms are not we have<br>multiple knowledges we have local<br>knowledges we have different ways of<br>representing<br>the world all of those are part of what<br>happens in our faculty and people are<br>working on questions of curriculum<br>and place based knowledge um to to begin<br>to sort of widen our definitions of<br>knowledge<br>and finally and last but not least would<br>be sustaining uh transforming<br>sustainability and transforming<br>environments<br>um where increasingly we're recognizing<br>that the social and the natural<br>worlds cannot be separated and we need<br>to build those into all of our areas<br>of work and i think that sort of<br>identifies one of the sort of the the<br>sense of<br>there is room to do more for instance<br>one of the the programs i'm very<br>involved in is within teacher education<br>and at the moment we don't have a<br>curriculum development focused<br>on all of our for all of our beginning<br>teachers around questions of environment<br>and we need to find ways to begin to to<br>make that central to all our<br>conversations<br>um young people growing up in in schools<br>now leaving school<br>this year next year five years time will<br>be growing up in a very very different<br>world<br>in terms of the climate change and<br>ecological challenges which they face<br>how does a curriculum and how can<br>teachers prepare<br>young people for that challenge<br>yeah you mentioned there that you've got<br>an interest obviously within<br>um teacher education but you also um<br>a lot of your your research is is rooted<br>in geographical<br>education would you be able to tell us<br>more about the work in that area john<br>and the role education and perhaps<br>educational leadership<br>um plays in sustainability and the<br>importance of geographical<br>uh education in today's increasingly<br>interconnected<br>world well i suppose as a geography<br>educator i would say that geography is<br>the most important subject<br>for identifying sustainability but but i<br>would say that<br>um but but i think there's this sense of<br>always trying to take a sort of a<br>backward step and begin to look at where<br>we've come<br>i think it's really important that<br>modern environmentalism really is<br>probably only 60 years old<br>the publication of rachel carson's<br>famous book silent spring<br>and since then there's been a gradual<br>recognition<br>of the importance of sustainability in<br>virtually all levels of society so when<br>i started teaching in 1988<br>large corporations in the uk such as<br>marx and spencer's denied that climate<br>change<br>was happening we are a long way from<br>that now in that period of 40 years<br>we recognize societally and in<br>governmental terms<br>that something needs to be done we may<br>not be doing it at that point<br>but it as fast as we need to but it's<br>recognized and so on<br>and education is is linked to that too a<br>need for<br>for the for the centrality of debates<br>about the environment within all<br>curriculum subjects<br>my own sense as a geographer is that we<br>have struggled to incorporate<br>environmental themes as explicitly<br>in curricula across the world as we<br>should do<br>and so the people talk often that<br>there's a geographically ignorance<br>amongst<br>particular generation younger<br>generations and geography education is<br>clearly concerned<br>about that but geography ought to be<br>sort of seen as as<br>as sort of a hub whereby all subjects<br>within the curriculum have something to<br>say so environmental history<br>quite important for history to begin to<br>talk about the big issues<br>around the changing nature of earth<br>systems in terms of studying poetry and<br>studying literature<br>the english curriculum can be a place to<br>reflect on nature in the genres of late<br>nature writing<br>science and sustainability obviously go<br>hand in hand<br>and move towards more public<br>understanding of science so i sort of<br>wouldn't want to be sort of um<br>territorial about the notion of<br>geography as<br>part of the curriculum there needs to be<br>a sort of outward radiating<br>of environmental thinking and<br>sustainable thinking at all levels<br>of our curriculum thanks john and thanks<br>anna for your answers before<br>that as well now kind of um staying on<br>that same uh somewhat same theme of<br>geography uh tim um your research<br>focuses on public policy but also you<br>know within international development<br>and immigration law which obviously<br>relates to human geography<br>uh and comparative politics um can you<br>tell us about the public policy policy<br>institute<br>um and what the work uh that you're<br>doing um<br>there is um and how the research is<br>helping make a difference in communities<br>both uh in here in new zealand and<br>offshore uh sure thanks ben um<br>so the public policy institute or ppi as<br>it's<br>referred to here exists to foster<br>independent critical research<br>uh on key policy issues that<br>affects new zealand but uh<br>broader communities throughout the asia<br>pacific<br>and even around the world we<br>sort of developed the center on an<br>interdisciplinary model<br>and it brings scholars together from<br>across the a faculties<br>um of the university and the aim is to<br>disseminate<br>evidence-informed policy-relevant<br>knowledge<br>we work with government on all levels<br>here in new zealand including very close<br>ties<br>uh with new zealand's largest city here<br>in auckland but also strong connections<br>with central government ministries<br>ngos and communities in particular and<br>some of my work over the last<br>um year and a half has been to to sort<br>of broaden these partnerships out<br>uh to other parts of the world and as<br>ben mentioned earlier<br>um one of those initiatives is uh<br>currently<br>underway uh with the u21 partner<br>at mcmaster university in ontario we're<br>doing an innovative um<br>public policy uh t training exercise<br>that will be done in semester one next<br>year<br>where we're bringing students together<br>in basically a<br>from both universities to work on<br>indigenous policy issues related to food<br>security<br>both in new zealand and with first<br>nations uh in ontario<br>and the opportunity for students here is<br>to look at a policy problem in a<br>comparative<br>context to explore issues here<br>learn about how we engage with<br>communities here<br>to solve policy problems but also how do<br>we<br>and other researchers in other contexts<br>identify problems and collaborate to<br>find problems so how can we lessen draw<br>and work together on that<br>the public policy institute is sort of<br>related to that as home<br>of the master of public policy program<br>which offers students the opportunities<br>to gain<br>practical skills um in policy analysis<br>economics of policy research skills the<br>opportunity to design their own research<br>thesis or dissertation and<br>that lead to careers and as i know we'll<br>hear from one of our<br>alums in a few moments in the public<br>policy and administration space but also<br>if you wish to pursue further studies<br>for phd<br>so we sort of intersect there and<br>briefly i'd just like to mention<br>uh the ppi is also an organization<br>that's active at that intersection of<br>research and applied work with<br>university<br>so we're currently hosting a large<br>ministry of business innovation and<br>employment grant under the leadership of<br>our the center's director professor<br>jennifer curtin<br>um that's looking at gender budgeting<br>practices within central government here<br>in new zealand<br>we also host a trade school once a year<br>in conjunction with the ministry of<br>foreign affairs and trade<br>that brings together policy actors from<br>across<br>not only new zealand but in the region<br>that are interested in trade<br>uh policy issues um so you get to<br>mix it up a bit with uh government<br>officials<br>other scholars from across the<br>university and that's i think how i put<br>it that we're<br>sort of engaged to positively impact<br>communities<br>uh here and abroad<br>fantastic thanks tim and i think um<br>you're quite right i guess that now more<br>than ever that the need to be able to<br>provide students with with that<br>practical experience and show<br>how to put it all into practice is is<br>now more<br>important um than ever so it's fantastic<br>the faculty of arts and the university<br>of auckland does have that connection<br>with the public uh public policy<br>institute ppi<br>um sticking with you uh tim um<br>considering the current global global<br>landscape<br>how does the teaching training and<br>research in public policy contribute to<br>the thought leadership<br>uh right um so this is sort of echoing a<br>bit of um<br>something anna mentioned earlier but um<br>i mean i think we<br>we're all uh consumers of the news here<br>certainly<br>and i know all the participants in this<br>are in their own countries<br>but we can look around the world and see<br>these trends this current landscape<br>is at a crossroads of sorts and that<br>redefining what's going to come forward<br>to sort of echo john's<br>earlier comments is this point uh<br>the sort of inflection point i suppose<br>for lack of a better term that we're at<br>in this current global landscape<br>thinking about<br>um how what the role the proper role of<br>government institutions<br>is and that these institutions are under<br>assault there's a lack of trust in many<br>countries in these institutions some of<br>it<br>is well earned lack of trust uh due to<br>corruption and other<br>other things that that sort of depress<br>that citizen<br>and non-citizen confidence in government<br>organizations<br>um unmoored in some ways from the<br>confidence in these institutions<br>the academy is playing this crucial role<br>um here<br>to think about training teaching<br>research<br>and particularly in the public policy<br>space so i'm a fan of<br>geography as well and there's a lot of<br>overlap between geography<br>law and public policy and public policy<br>is best when it's informed by those<br>other disciplines<br>clearly um the university of auckland um<br>as you know an institution of higher<br>learning<br>leverages this world leading research<br>and this research based teaching and<br>training<br>model to this purpose the masters of<br>public policy courses<br>for example are taught by policy<br>researchers<br>many of whom were either practitioners<br>at one time or who have engaged in<br>fellowships to go and work with<br>government ministries<br>to bring those lessons back from the<br>bureaucracies<br>around the world back into the classroom<br>and inform our research and teaching<br>my approach of course is one that you<br>should learn real<br>world policy analysis techniques and<br>engage in exercises in the classroom i<br>described one just a few moments ago<br>that we're in the process right now of<br>co-designing with our colleagues<br>at mcmaster university in ontario that's<br>designed to do just this<br>but it's an opportunity for students<br>through this teaching and training to<br>explore fresh ideas<br>pose challenging questions and to expand<br>your thinking<br>and you never know you might just<br>generate an insight<br>in the classroom that you're able to<br>bring back uh with you<br>to your ministry or your ngo or wherever<br>you're working in the world<br>that makes a positive um contribution to<br>social change in your community<br>thanks tim um now sticking within the<br>the uh master of public policy we also<br>have a special guest with us<br>uh today um we have alumnus min trong<br>on the panel with us and we'd like to<br>ask you a couple of questions<br>um you came here to news uh you came to<br>new zealand<br>as a new zealand scholar i'm an asean<br>scholarship recipient<br>and you're now working at the consulate<br>general of canada in ho chi<br>minh city saigon vietnam can you tell us<br>about how your time at the university of<br>auckland impacted your career and the<br>vision that you had for the future<br>thank you brian for having me today well<br>i studied at the university of auckland<br>for the master public policy program<br>back in 2016 and i think it has brought<br>a valuable experience for<br>my professional and personal development<br>i enjoy learning the critical knowledge<br>and skills in<br>comparative public policy political<br>management in government<br>trade and international relations so i<br>think believe<br>that this course had prepared me for<br>drafting<br>policy briefing and making critical<br>advice to high-level management<br>which are very useful for my role as a<br>trade commissioner<br>at the consulate general of canada so<br>back in 2017 i had the opportunity<br>to be the liaison for the canadian<br>minister of international trade<br>and uh sorry at the apec summit in<br>vietnam<br>so as i mentioned earlier the skill and<br>knowledge that again from the mpp<br>program<br>was crucial for me to fulfill this super<br>challenging role<br>even though that it was more than more<br>than a week<br>so at the completion of the summit i was<br>among the local team that<br>supported canadian leaders to meet and<br>shake hand with the prime minister of<br>canada<br>justin trudeau so it was one of the most<br>memorable<br>milestones of my career so personally i<br>think<br>the time studying at the university and<br>university of oakland has<br>contributed to the growth of my career<br>and shaped my vision<br>as a global citizen i can work at my<br>home country<br>while making positive changes across<br>borders<br>for example enhancing trade flow between<br>canada and vietnam<br>so this is something that i really value<br>as an alumnus of the university<br>and also as a former recipient of the<br>new zealand scholar awards<br>thanks men and sticking on that theme of<br>uh employability so the university of<br>auckland ranks<br>uh 59th in the world for producing<br>highly employable<br>graduates according to the 2020 qs<br>graduate employability rankings<br>um from an alumni perspectives what<br>skills did you gain and you've touched<br>on this already a little bit but<br>um how does this align with shaping the<br>future and creating a positive social<br>impact<br>yeah happy to share my experience so<br>beyond studies in the classroom i had a<br>chance to do an<br>internship at the office of a member of<br>parliament<br>in the auckland area so this is thanks<br>to the great connection between the<br>master public policy program<br>and the public sector in new zealand for<br>me it was an eye-opening experience<br>because i have a chance to engage with<br>the mt<br>and talk about new zealand politics<br>election in new zealand<br>and i also have the chance to observe<br>how the mp interact<br>and assist the constituents an<br>opportunity like that is rare in my home<br>country<br>because connection to politicians here<br>for a student to do a research and<br>internship<br>is somewhat limited so in new zealand i<br>also did some interviews with other mps<br>for my research topic and all of them<br>were very supportive<br>about creating social impact after<br>completion of my study i have been<br>working with some alumni<br>here in vietnam and some in asian<br>countries to create<br>a network to empower young people in our<br>home country to pursue graduate study in<br>new zealand<br>for networking events share our advice<br>and experience<br>and we believe that this new generation<br>can create<br>further positive social impact if they<br>can study overseas<br>and bring the skills and knowledge to<br>contribute to the social economic<br>development<br>of their country so i just want to share<br>a quote from michelle obama that i<br>really like<br>on helping others when you work hard and<br>done well and walk<br>through the doorway opportunity you do<br>not slam it shut<br>behind you you reach back and you give<br>other folks the same chances<br>that have you succeed that's it saying<br>that i really<br>really think that is meaningful to me<br>and also<br>for um uh younger generation in vietnam<br>that want to pursue study<br>uh overseas fantastic thanks man it<br>sounds like you were an ideal candidate<br>for<br>uh both the the master of public policy<br>at the university of auckland but also<br>the new zealand asean<br>um scholarship which is um uh<br>which is centered around exactly what<br>you've done come to new zealand and<br>really<br>um get the skills get the training get<br>the education that you need<br>in order to to go home and then better<br>yourself and and better your communities<br>and and it sounds like you're doing just<br>that and<br>and not just stopping there but also<br>helping others<br>others go through that process as well<br>so thank you so much<br>for your insights there now bringing it<br>back around<br>to something that we mentioned at the<br>beginning and also to bring our<br>academics back into this conversation<br>it'd be good to hear from each of you uh<br>on this uh this last question<br>so uh we have touched upon this um in<br>the past 45 minutes<br>but according to the economist<br>intelligence unit new zealand ranks<br>above all<br>english-speaking countries in educating<br>students for the future<br>um why do you think new zealand does<br>this so well and how does this intersect<br>with today's topic<br>of creating a more sustainable and<br>equitable future<br>perhaps if i could um start with anna<br>sure thanks so much ben so i think that<br>new zealand<br>has a really long history of engaging<br>um with the international system and<br>punching above its weight<br>um we were there at founding of the<br>united nations and we've taken a really<br>active interest um both before and since<br>that time in engaging<br>with what's happening on the<br>international stage and because we're a<br>relatively small country and we don't<br>have<br>heaps and heaps and heaps of people<br>there are a lot of different<br>opportunities<br>for people to get involved with a lot of<br>the<br>activities and initiatives that are<br>happening around<br>the big global challenges and around<br>sustainability issues<br>so i think one of the reasons why new<br>zealand comes up well is because as a<br>country<br>we've got a commitment to these ideas<br>there's a lot of discussion about them<br>there's a lot of engagement with them<br>and there are heaps of opportunities and<br>i think we see that coming through<br>into the university where many of these<br>staff and students are actively engaged<br>um<br>and it's a really vibrant place to be in<br>in this sort of space thanks anna<br>um john hmm<br>so i was listening to what i know just<br>was saying there was<br>and i sort of agreeing with it but um it<br>was making me think that this morning i<br>was reading<br>um around the history of british<br>migration to new zealand in the post-war<br>period<br>from the united kingdom and how new<br>zealand at that point<br>was determined to have only british<br>migrants at that point this was 1947<br>and that was the official policy um<br>and how that is no longer the case and<br>hasn't been<br>since around the mid-1990s when new<br>zealand has opened the doors to a<br>various various<br>and multitudinous streams of migration<br>flows<br>particularly from other parts of the<br>pacific region and south<br>south east asia for instance and the way<br>in which that sort of<br>that new source of migrants<br>brings with it new ideas new confluences<br>new opportunities to reinvent<br>and be open so there's a historical sort<br>of relationship of new zealand being<br>a small country at the edge of the world<br>off the map on the edge of the map<br>which has to reach out to other parts of<br>the world<br>and therefore makes it more receptive to<br>ideas and to different cultural<br>influences and so on so i think there's<br>something sort of<br>i'm thinking aloud here but i think it'd<br>be really interesting to explore that's<br>what makes new zealand feel<br>different i've been here from the united<br>kingdom 10 years ago<br>10 years and you probably the same ben<br>to be in the uk is living in an old<br>country to be in new zealand feels like<br>you're living in a new country<br>and i think that's got something to do<br>with the future orientated<br>nature of new zealand's education system<br>yeah i would i would agree with you<br>there and it's only been three and a<br>half years for me but um<br>but i can definitely yeah i'm still a<br>newbie um<br>uh tim would you also be able to add<br>some uh insights there<br>yeah thanks um those are all really good<br>points so i just want to<br>do two things add a couple comments<br>briefly and then<br>contextualize this a little bit to my<br>role here at the university<br>the public policy institute working with<br>graduate students<br>so out of these rankings uh new zealand<br>ranked<br>particularly high for gender equality<br>diversity<br>and tolerance okay the university has an<br>explicit focus<br>on student support including english<br>language enrichment<br>research support resources and career<br>development pathways<br>so students emerge from the programs<br>ready to begin<br>or resume their careers or to pursue<br>further in<br>education opportunities as far as your<br>interests should take you<br>what this suggests to me is<br>a stimulating nurturing environment for<br>international students<br>that allows you to build a range of<br>analytical skills<br>while not losing your individual<br>identities or feeling like you have to<br>mute the richness of your culture<br>during your studies here you have the<br>opportunity to flourish in a place<br>that's beautiful<br>welcoming and supportive that's what<br>brought me here i<br>was a student here so i think it's like<br>the united states we have the funny<br>commercial<br>the hair club for men and the guy would<br>talk and his beautiful head of hair<br>and then at the end he says i'm not only<br>the president of the hair club i'm a<br>member and he shows a picture<br>and he was bald before okay so that's<br>kind of this experience<br>i speak i was a student here and uh now<br>i work here and live here<br>and have been here for 10 years just<br>like john<br>so in sum learning happens both<br>inside and out of the classroom in my<br>view the ranking is an important<br>indicator for a student thinking about a<br>place to go<br>that allows you to reach your potential<br>make lasting relationships<br>is a theme i mentioned earlier and and<br>to have an education that's fit for<br>purpose<br>to make a positive social impact in your<br>community<br>great thank you so much tim there and<br>that actually concludes the the set<br>questions that we did have for the panel<br>um<br>this afternoon we do have questions from<br>the audience i believe one has come<br>through and this would be<br>uh this would be sticking with you uh<br>tim<br>would you be able to speak to their<br>career or employability<br>statistics of students
