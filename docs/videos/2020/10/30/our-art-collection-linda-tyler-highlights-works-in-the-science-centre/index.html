so you can come in<br>and wander around<br>this building's special it opened in<br>2017<br>and as part of its planning we organise<br>to have artworks either side of the lift<br>shaft<br>so every level on 10 floors there's a<br>painting or a photograph<br>which you can have a look at which fit<br>in with the theme of natural history<br>conservation and geological sciences<br>right inside the door as you enter on<br>your left is this remarkable photograph<br>by the artist fiona paddington fiona<br>completed her doctorate of fine arts at<br>the university of auckland<br>and she did it looking at museum<br>collections and particularly the ways in<br>which they have<br>appropriated maori taunga this<br>particular work<br>inseparable huia deals with the two<br>birds<br>of a particular collection in te papa<br>which is a natural history collection<br>as you can see the most interesting<br>feature of the huia was the<br>sexual dimorphism the fact that their<br>beaks are such different<br>shapes the male has the short beak the<br>female has the long<br>elegant curved beak unfortunately this<br>meant that they were hunted to<br>extinction<br>as a result of european colonisation and<br>people starting to develop<br>a kind of a craze for the huia beak as a<br>brooch<br>huia feathers were also incredibly<br>popular<br>and treasured by the maori but the<br>beautiful thing about this photograph<br>is that fiona manages to capture the<br>nature of the relationship between the<br>birds<br>they mate for life and as inseparable<br>huia<br>they worked together to hunt for grubs<br>the male with his shorter beak<br>was able to break open dead wood and the<br>female with her longer<br>hooked beak was able to get inside and<br>remove the insects and as such<br>they're a kind of a metaphor for an<br>ideal relationship<br>between nature and culture one<br>unfortunately that is not often<br>achieved in the design of this building<br>patrick clifford from architectus left<br>the centre part<br>of the concrete empty for a big<br>tupperwork<br>originally we were going to commission a<br>customary tongan<br>tapa to hang in the center however dame<br>rob and white a distinguished alumna<br>of the university of auckland had been<br>working up in tonga with rua fifita<br>on developing a three-part triptych that<br>you can see hanging here<br>against the rough cast at the center of<br>the building<br>what she's done is taken the metaphor of<br>the way in which<br>eels or tuna migrate from new zealand to<br>go<br>up to tonga to spawn following the<br>direction of the kermadec trench<br>and that she's seen as a metaphor for<br>the way in which<br>tongan people have migrated to new<br>zealand often to work<br>in quite lowly paid jobs in industry in<br>the 1970s in new zealand<br>and that's represented in this triptych<br>by the center panel which is about the<br>friction between<br>cultures however what you can see as<br>well<br>is the kind of exchange of food and<br>hospitality that goes on between<br>tonga and new zealand at the bottom you<br>can see all of the things that are sent<br>exported<br>over to tonga like the palm corned beef<br>and the tinned mackerel there's also a<br>teapot<br>and you can also see the bell packet of<br>tea<br>right in the front of this waka shape<br>showing the kind of journeying on a boat<br>to take these sorts of commodities over<br>to tonga<br>up at the top are the sorts of things<br>that tongan people send to their<br>diaspora<br>all of their relatives that have left to<br>go and live in new zealand<br>so you can see that the whole theme of<br>the work is one of<br>exchange and relationship across the<br>ocean and the title of the work<br>cu imoana togetherness across the ocean<br>encapsulates that<br>a lot of the paintings in the science<br>centre are by<br>young pacific artists or have the kind<br>of pacific theme<br>and that was a really conscious choice<br>to try and make the whole<br>scheme of the hanging of artworks into a<br>kind of cohesive whole<br>this particular work is by fine arts<br>graduate graeme fletcher who samoan<br>and it's from his series that he<br>finished during his doctoral year<br>its title is lounge room tribalism<br>and what he's trying to comment on in<br>this particular painting in the whole<br>series<br>is the fact that cultural artifacts from<br>pacific cultures have been appropriated<br>into a kind of aesthetic of interior<br>design<br>by europeans often without any<br>understanding of the background<br>and the ideas that are associated with<br>the particular things<br>so if you look into this particular<br>painting you can see<br>on the wall up above the television set<br>of all things<br>three mere which would of course been<br>used in combat in the 19th century and<br>earlier<br>made out of green stone or punamu a<br>canoe baler here<br>on the foreground on a coffee table and<br>then over in the<br>um little area which is by the window<br>just below the budgerigar cage that's<br>hanging<br>you can see a solomon island warrior<br>in a kind of a mannequin form so the<br>whole theme of the work<br>really points to the mid-century when<br>modernism<br>was the kind of aesthetic that people<br>were opting for<br>in new zealand and you can see by the<br>manual typewriter and the type of chair<br>and so on that that's and his attempt to<br>recreate<br>that kind of aesthetic but this is<br>something that still goes on today<br>often people collect artifacts they call<br>tribal<br>artifacts without ever thinking about<br>the cultures<br>and what they might represent<br>spiritually for the people that produce<br>them<br>up here on the fourth floor is we can<br>find this wonderful work by richard<br>gorgeous<br>it's called flower idol a colour<br>photograph that he made during his last<br>year<br>of his mfa at the inland school of fine<br>arts<br>richard was really interested in the<br>connections between<br>how people relate to nature now and how<br>they have done<br>in different societies historically so<br>he's particularly keen to kind of create<br>a sense of<br>perhaps ritual in this photograph it's<br>called flower idol<br>and you can see that the figure the male<br>has had his face in his hair<br>completely covered in mud so he's like<br>at one with nature<br>and then his body is totally covered<br>with angelica<br>beautiful cymbidium orchids gardenia<br>camellias<br>all of the richness pansies of nature<br>in its flowering floribunda sense and<br>one of the things that he's done that's<br>rather humorous<br>is included this picture plant um of<br>daytora exactly in the position<br>where the penis would be so he's drawing<br>attention to the sexualized associations<br>that people often had historically in<br>cultures such as ancient<br>england where they had the worship of<br>the green man<br>as a kind of a fertility symbol in order<br>to make sure that their<br>hops and their different crops would<br>come into flower<br>and be bountiful interestingly as part<br>of this whole series the flower idle<br>he also had an element of performance<br>and used mud<br>to create a kind of a sense of a sort of<br>more primitive culture<br>but in so doing he wanted to draw<br>attention to the fact<br>that we haven't always lived such<br>clinical lives removed from nature<br>once of course everything to do with the<br>seasons and the way in which nature<br>operated<br>was a paramount point of importance for<br>people in order to survive<br>so this work is a kind of a reminder to<br>people at the school of environment<br>to think about the ways in which we<br>might want to be in harmony<br>but also to think about perhaps some of<br>the medicinal purposes<br>to create create other consciousnesses<br>so this is a painting by a tongan artist<br>called julian hooper<br>which is actually dealing with our<br>tauros colonial history<br>not only its history of painting but<br>also<br>its history geologically and a bit to do<br>with the whole business of<br>the relationship between artists and<br>colonisation<br>down at the bottom part of the work you<br>can see<br>a figure who's dressed in military union<br>uniform but he's<br>angling something at the scene which<br>looks very much like a gun that turns<br>out to be a paintbrush and it's the<br>paintbrush that he's used<br>to describe one of the flanks of mount<br>taranaki<br>and what julian hooper has done in this<br>particular work<br>is use the figure of an historical<br>painter charles heaphy<br>who was a military artist and who really<br>represented new zealand<br>in a way that made it look like it was<br>empty<br>and available for so he's trying to do<br>a kind of geographical contrast between<br>the way that heaphy painted taranaki and<br>how<br>the mountain itself looks today as you<br>can see<br>a totally different profile with<br>phantom's peak in the foreground<br>so he's more or less arguing that<br>there's a sort of a diagrammatic aspect<br>to the painting<br>which has more to do with heaphy trying<br>to project an<br>ideal of landscape than the reality of<br>the geography itself<br>these photographs were made by the<br>artist lisa rohana<br>as part of the work that she did towards<br>her venice biennale<br>presentation which was in 2016.<br>what's interesting about them is that<br>she has played off the<br>ideas that she has derived from an<br>18th century wallpaper which represented<br>all the people of the pacific<br>pretty much as they had been described<br>by captain cook<br>and his voyages so that section<br>of wallpaper which was called les<br>sauvage de mer or<br>the savages of the south seas<br>didn't really give the individuals<br>depicted any kind of<br>agency it represented them in very<br>stereotypical ways<br>so what's lovely about this set of<br>photographs is that<br>she has dressed up modern day people her<br>contemporary specific contemporaries<br>in ways that echo the way in which the<br>europeans represented those pacific<br>peoples<br>but given them much more of a sense of<br>vibrancy and aliveness<br>so this is a representation of umai and<br>ubera<br>and you can see that they are dressed in<br>the sort of robes that would have been<br>the classical form from the 18th century<br>from that wallpaper fragment<br>and here on the left hand side is the<br>curator of historical new zealand art<br>from the auckland art gallery julia<br>waite and she's a six foot tall woman<br>and she's been dressed up as the captain<br>himself<br>so in a way she's lisa as an artist<br>is trying to kind of deconstruct this<br>idea<br>of cook as the hero and the western<br>perspective as being the only way<br>of looking at the 18th century<br>representation of people<br>in the south pacific and instead she's<br>taking a deep dive into history<br>using oral narratives and also the<br>materials of the time<br>in order to recreate what it would have<br>been like to be back then<br>having that kind of first encounter with<br>europeans<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
