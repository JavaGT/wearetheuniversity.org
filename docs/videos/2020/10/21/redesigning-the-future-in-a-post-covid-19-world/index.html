wellington<br>we are today looking at redesigning the<br>future in a post code world i have been<br>provided with slides for everything<br>which is very helpful<br>so my name is um ina reichenberger i'm a<br>lecturer with a tourism management<br>department here at victoria university i<br>have the pleasure of chairing today<br>and introducing our fantastic speakers<br>that we have<br>the theme of the webinar today and what<br>we'll be talking about is<br>essentially what the future is going to<br>look like what we need to consider how<br>to redesign the future<br>in terms of covet we are in a time of<br>crisis a lot of the strategic planning<br>the thinking the considerations are very<br>much<br>future focused the future that we don't<br>really necessarily know what it's going<br>to look like<br>so questions that we'll be covering<br>today from a variety of different<br>perspectives are what is the future<br>what is going to change what might not<br>change how do we prepare for it what are<br>the changes we would like to see<br>so we're really lucky to have five<br>future thinkers<br>um from victoria university of<br>wellington or alumni of victorious<br>victoria university of wellington here<br>with us today<br>we have on the one hand an associate<br>professor ian yeoman<br>from our tourism management group we<br>have dr marco menses a senior researcher<br>with the new zealand transport agency<br>we have associate professor mary tate<br>from<br>information management professor<br>nicholas agar from philosophy as well<br>as professor jonathan boston from public<br>policy<br>so all of our five speakers today have<br>prepared a short five six minute<br>presentation on their thoughts on the<br>meter<br>we'll be i've been advised to very much<br>stick to time so that would be wonderful<br>for our audience um we'll have a<br>q a round at the end of the webinar so<br>we will serve the final 10-15 minutes<br>for that<br>if you do have questions that you would<br>like to ask our speakers there is a q a<br>function<br>at the bottom of your screen or the top<br>of your screen depending on how you're<br>set up<br>where you can enter your questions and<br>where you can also see what other<br>questions have been entered<br>and you can upvote them and the ones<br>with the most upvotes of course<br>will be focusing on towards the end<br>so without further ado i'll hand over<br>for our first short talk to associate<br>professor ian yeoman<br>what is even the future excellent<br>thank you ina and kirora the world and<br>new zealand<br>and i think the title sums up what i'm<br>trying to say<br>is the question is what is the future<br>but it's actually not what is the future<br>it is it's that word futures um<br>because if i was sitting here today and<br>i knew<br>what the exact future would be i would<br>be able<br>i probably know the lottery numbers for<br>this weekend or be able to make<br>a range of predictions with a high<br>degree of certainty<br>so as a starting point the question is<br>what is the future<br>basically it's the concept of futures<br>not the future in the terms of that and<br>and i think the starting point for<br>everybody to understand<br>futures is made up of four concise<br>elements and it's about knowing what the<br>future is<br>and i think everybody has a sense that<br>the future is important we all have a<br>sense<br>that something's going to happen we all<br>have a sense<br>that the future will unfold so we have<br>it<br>a conscious understanding of what the<br>future could<br>of what the future can be another<br>element of what the future is<br>is this high degree of uncertainty<br>and because the future is is very much<br>unknown there's degrees of<br>predictability and there's degrees of<br>risk<br>and if we take the world of corvit 19<br>that too many came as a surprise<br>but to others corvette 19<br>was a certainty because those involved<br>in risk management<br>those involved in pandemics knew<br>something would happen<br>but the point was it the unknown element<br>is<br>when would it happen this leads to the<br>issue of complexity<br>and the complexities when we're looking<br>at the future it's just not about<br>it's very difficult to isolate one<br>element<br>it's about trying to understand a range<br>of different<br>elements and the relationship between<br>them<br>so any decision that we take about the<br>future<br>and how we take a decision on x<br>has consequences on y and zed<br>both intended and unintended<br>and the final thing that's very<br>important about the future is what uh<br>professor jim dettner<br>from hawaii says there's no one future<br>only a range of futures or alternative<br>futures that can be<br>that can be predicted so when we come to<br>look at the future<br>what is that future all about and how we<br>shape it<br>and how we talk about it next slide<br>please<br>so when we talk about the futures and<br>building upon what<br>jim didn't said it's about those<br>alternatives<br>it's about telling the same story but<br>different ways<br>on one hand you're trying to find the<br>degree of truth<br>and secondly you're trying to explain<br>how something could happen<br>and different ways you speak about the<br>future are based upon<br>this matrix that we haven't in front of<br>you<br>if the future is very predictable and<br>very certain<br>it's very scientific it's very empirical<br>and it's based upon evidence and facts<br>and figures and that's a type of future<br>we associate with eagan<br>economics it's a type of future we<br>associate with<br>with policy lots of facts and figures<br>whereas the science fiction future has<br>no truth about it<br>it's unpredictable but we could probably<br>explain<br>how something could happen so it's<br>taking all of these weak signals in<br>society<br>that we have and trying to explain the<br>justification<br>and how that could happen whereas a<br>prognosis<br>is a future with a degree of<br>truthfulness<br>and that's probably what i mean by this<br>is when you go to the you when you go<br>and see your doctor and you say you've<br>got<br>symptoms a b and c your doctor's prop<br>coming to our conclusion<br>he's saying you've got systems a b c and<br>d he doesn't know what exactly what's<br>wrong with you<br>but he can make it he can make an<br>educated guess<br>so that and whereas other futures<br>are dystopian and utopian futures these<br>are futures we either want<br>or don't want and associated with<br>different pathways<br>next slide please so that brings us to<br>corvette 19.<br>what is the future it seems with<br>corvette 19<br>we're caught between this dystopian and<br>utopian future<br>on one hand the dystopian future is what<br>we've got<br>and it's it's something that's probably<br>out of out of a science fiction film to<br>many<br>whether that's uh contagion or<br>outbreak it's it's something that's<br>disruptive<br>and has brought about collapse in<br>society to many people<br>it's unimagined and unimaginable<br>so as a consequence of this scenario and<br>this world that we've<br>got many of us are responding<br>with the opposite many of us are<br>responding with<br>you utopian futures um<br>and very much if you've seen the film<br>the beach which is a typical<br>utopian utopian film about something<br>that's about<br>paradise something that we want<br>something where we want to be<br>so a classical example of that is within<br>tourism we have a tourism futures task<br>force<br>and their objective of their life their<br>world<br>is what is the future we want<br>how do we get there in the terms of of<br>what we're doing<br>and that's the end of my short<br>presentation about dystopian utopia and<br>what this means for future studies<br>ian thank you very much that already got<br>us off to a fantastic start with some<br>background knowledge on how we can think<br>about what futures actually<br>are for our second show talk today and<br>we're welcoming dr malcolm menzies from<br>the new zealand transport agency<br>and malcolm i'll hand straight over to<br>you and if the audience has any<br>questions for ian in the meantime then<br>please do pop them in the q<br>a and we'll get to that later thank you<br>welcome<br>thank you just to be clear i'm here as<br>an independent futures thinker i don't<br>represent any agency if there's anybody<br>from<br>wakakotahi out there i wonder what's<br>happening i'm doing this on my lunch<br>break<br>so if we can go to the first slide<br>please<br>um i've had a sneak peek at some of the<br>other presenters<br>slides and there's a lot of overlap<br>between what we're saying<br>now i think we're complementing each<br>other and some of what ian's<br>mentioned i would also reinforce<br>the the question i pose is why why<br>is futures thinking useful<br>and there's a classic um story about the<br>pace of change<br>that we can't use the past any anymore<br>to the same extent to predict the future<br>um that long-term development such as in<br>the area of infrastructure and<br>environment need<br>to choose an optimal path early so some<br>kind of idea<br>of what interventions are needed need to<br>be selected with<br>the future or futures in mind forecasts<br>are increasingly less useful<br>they might stretch out five years but i<br>mean who can forecast what's going to<br>happen with<br>covert probably no one<br>projections we might project out to the<br>2050s<br>we know roughly what the age structure<br>of the<br>population is barring complete disasters<br>that helps us plan for example<br>the prevention of the provision of<br>retirement incomes futures does help us<br>futures do help us think about what if<br>the possibilities that are out there how<br>would we respond<br>if this future or that future came about<br>uh to which we can actually create our<br>own future if we have a preferred future<br>if we've got a vision of it we've more<br>likely to be able to create it<br>but at bottom i think the main purpose<br>or use of futures thinking is that it<br>helps to open up minds it helps to<br>open up close minds and events and form<br>policy and strategy<br>and to build adaptability and resilience<br>i mean a lot of people<br>have classed cover 19 as a surprise<br>a wild card for people in public health<br>it wasn't<br>um and people have written books about<br>the prospect of<br>a future epidemic if we uh if policy had<br>been more responsive we might have<br>invested more in the<br>kind of icus and<br>respirators and so on that would have<br>made us more resilient<br>um so next slide please<br>they uh there's a lot of talk post<br>covert and and before about the need for<br>uh thinking about the future and the<br>word transformation comes about a lot<br>is used a lot particularly in terms of<br>uh economic transformation<br>and we've been here before to some<br>extent you could even go back to<br>to uh julius vogel in the 19th century<br>who<br>borrowed large amounts of money to help<br>build the infrastructure that we<br>used for many decades vents<br>there were industry conferences in those<br>dates there<br>um the 72 conference led to the<br>the planning act and the setting up of<br>the commission for future and planning<br>council<br>um the futures trust um took over from<br>the<br>commission for the future we could put<br>in there the um<br>think big projects which tried to<br>transform new zealand economy<br>and promised 410 000 new jobs<br>it had a mixed success the jury's still<br>out some of those projects did work<br>and some didn't we had the porter<br>project the knowledge wave<br>in 2001 and recently well not so<br>recently now but<br>the uh the job summit in 2009 i could<br>add some other<br>um events or attempts in there too at<br>the level of<br>ministries so next slide<br>um i think we've learned from all those<br>previous attempts<br>that um there is a mixture of<br>attempts to imagine the future have<br>struggled to make headway<br>some initiatives have developed<br>delivered success but<br>after only a long delay<br>and whatever happened whatever you can<br>say that the the social landscape of<br>today would be<br>unrecognizable to someone from 1960<br>environmentally things might seem more<br>familiar although the shape of<br>this the state of our water would shock<br>a visitor from the past so some things<br>stay the same some things change<br>markedly<br>although i said that we can't predict<br>the future from the<br>past some elements of the future are<br>some elements of the past are embedded<br>in our future that's a that's a truism<br>but um nations are complex systems<br>they can't be run as if they're<br>corporations or so some people have<br>tried and we get changed from all<br>directions some<br>some planning efforts have worked some<br>futures if it's worked but<br>you also get change driven from the<br>middle<br>the bottom and they're enabled by wider<br>conditions<br>when we know that the best laid plans<br>can go awry i've had the minutes uh<br>signal<br>so we better go to the next slide<br>i just wanted to mention that there are<br>some techniques available<br>but next slide please<br>um i'm arguing that there is a futures<br>ecosystem out there to promote<br>uh futures thinking we need fast<br>thinking to deal with crises we need<br>more slow thinking to look at the<br>long-term horizon<br>the department of prime minister and<br>cabinet has tools on its website for<br>futures thinking<br>the new public service act requires<br>long-term insights<br>parliamentary processes that jonathan<br>may talk about<br>and there are various initiatives out<br>there private um<br>public ngos and there is an<br>international effort in future thinking<br>but i think<br>to use the metaphor of our ecosystem<br>some more forest ecosystem<br>needs uh we we lack oversight we<br>lack a canopy to view the whole field<br>and we lack a substrate to generate the<br>capability the human resource or the<br>human<br>capital required to promote futures<br>thinking and i<br>hope that we could establish those two<br>things<br>malcolm thank you so much for that<br>interesting insight into<br>how much farther we have to go and how<br>much needs to be taken into account and<br>some of the challenges we're facing<br>um we're going to hand over to our third<br>speaker now that's um<br>mary tate from our school of information<br>management on researching the future of<br>information<br>systems again questions of our please<br>pop them in the q a<br>thank you merited let's go straight on<br>to my next slide<br>um so i have a background in technology<br>and in practice and lately in<br>research about technology and<br>information systems<br>and in particular i've had a very strong<br>interest in research methods and the way<br>we<br>conduct inquiry and the ways we create<br>knowledge and it's become<br>very obvious to me that there's a very<br>considerable disconnect<br>emerging this was always the case to<br>some degree<br>but it is really accelerating and<br>getting a lot worse<br>and that we are presently engaged in<br>trying to create knowledge for the<br>future by looking in the rear view<br>mirror we're<br>investigating things that have already<br>happened<br>and when you put when you consider the<br>pace of technology change<br>with um when when you<br>put that against the usual research<br>methods and publication cycle there is a<br>very<br>uh severe mismatch uh when we're<br>engaged living history if you like when<br>we're engaged in a time of change<br>it's not always absolutely apparent how<br>rapidly it's occurring but if i could<br>but much smarter people than me and this<br>was published in nature have observed<br>that we are actually in a time of<br>exponential change<br>so it's been suggested that uh<br>we're not going to experience a hundred<br>years of progress<br>in the 21st century it's going to be<br>more<br>like 20 000 years of progress<br>at today's rate and this is coming from<br>technology is driving a lot of this so<br>exponential<br>advances and a suite of enabling<br>technologies like computing power<br>data storage uh performance on the<br>internet<br>and we're getting these tipping points<br>when<br>technologies that have been around for a<br>while are such as robotics and<br>artificial intelligence<br>and biology and nanotechnology and 3d<br>printing<br>are suddenly crossing a threshold and<br>really starting to trigger sudden and<br>significant social change<br>thank you so we we put that<br>along with this this issue that the way<br>we conduct research<br>tends to be relatively backward looking<br>so it starts with some kind of<br>literature search which of course is<br>material that's already published with<br>some kind of approach that looks at<br>spotting<br>gaps and current knowledge and often<br>looks at<br>empirical investigation of some kind of<br>current phenomenon something that's<br>already happening<br>and then you put that together with the<br>the publication cycle so you have<br>median acceptance rates for major<br>business journals have been<br>say about one to two years<br>with data that might have been gathered<br>two or three or four years before that<br>and i<br>just started to believe that we were<br>heading into our relevance and<br>credibility crisis<br>in terms of the way we create knowledge<br>and so i mean if you believe um<br>kurzwei this this sort of<br>lag is equivalent to<br>400 to 800 years of change i mean that<br>sounds it's a it's a sort of a shock<br>figure<br>you know but but the point is that<br>you know in a time of extremely rapid<br>change<br>i i put two to my fellow panelists<br>and two listeners that the way we're<br>currently creating knowledge<br>is probably not fit for purpose um if i<br>could have the next<br>slide please so<br>some of the other panelists have have<br>suggested<br>techniques um i would say<br>you know how can we future proof the way<br>we do research i would say<br>with considerable difficulty because of<br>some of the factors of uncertainty that<br>have already been<br>mentioned but but i would suggest we<br>should<br>uh include future methods and research<br>cycles<br>so we should do projections and and<br>scenario based research as well as<br>looking at<br>current situations uh we need to fold it<br>into<br>the way we write research papers so we<br>should include discussion of relevant<br>technology trends in our literature<br>analysis and include<br>future impact as a standard part of the<br>discussion section of papers or perhaps<br>we actually need to change our<br>publishing paradigm completely<br>in some way to make it more agile and<br>responsive so<br>i just had a very quick example but if<br>you think of something like ai<br>and nick is an expert in this um<br>the ais that you can investigate at the<br>moment<br>are typically sort of automated faq<br>pages or systems that are trained by<br>people<br>um by the time those studies go to press<br>ai's will be very considerably more<br>sophisticated<br>so uh so i'm closing<br>um with a call to action<br>that's my time up a call to action<br>uh to say that a futures research<br>shouldn't be a niche<br>area it needs to be a mainstream area it<br>needs to be folded in<br>all right mary thank you very much that<br>was an<br>excellent summary of a lot of the<br>challenges that we're facing from a<br>futures perspective<br>at least within the academic realm of<br>knowledge creation<br>perhaps potentially um nick a professor<br>of um philosophy<br>and who's our next speaker um<br>oh no you've changed the topic i've seen<br>yes you have my apologies yes um<br>right in which case i'll hand over to<br>you with the proposition that new<br>zealand needs a truly inclusive ministry<br>for the future<br>and perhaps some insight into what you<br>recommend that looks like thank you nick<br>thank you i mean in a way<br>this is my change of topic is what<br>happens when you read a book and get<br>fascinated by it and suddenly think<br>there's a new government here i wonder<br>if i can send them a message so this<br>really is directed to you guys but also<br>to jacinda<br>um if you are listening jacinda and<br>there's a young<br>sort of enthusiastic sort of new mp<br>who wants a job that would be great if<br>you could create<br>a truly inclusive ministry for the<br>future basically a ministry<br>tasked with addressing problems of the<br>future<br>and one that basically victoria<br>university<br>should supply graduates to staff<br>okay so there's the bulk kim stanley<br>robinson ministry for the future<br>and it's all about climate change it's<br>fascinating again it's kind of<br>one problem is um i didn't get to the<br>end of this book yet<br>so there could be a huge twist i hope<br>there's not but basically this book<br>is set in the near future and it's set<br>in the future in which<br>you know there have been climate change<br>disasters 20 million people have died in<br>india of a heat wave<br>so no one in this future can deny<br>climate change or ignore it everyone<br>sort of in a way agrees it's happening<br>and agrees that things must be done<br>but it's kind of more well yes i've got<br>a whole lot of coal here<br>people will pay me a lot of money to<br>burn it how much money will you give me<br>not to burn it i know that i shouldn't<br>and so that's kind of so in a way it<br>covers all this these<br>it's based in switzerland these members<br>of this ministry for the future<br>and the bullying and the threatening<br>they have to do<br>to get sort of entrenched interests off<br>their asses and make them do something<br>about it so i guess in a way what i'd<br>like to talk about i think that would be<br>when it comes to climate change i don't<br>know<br>we're not we haven't reached the stage<br>described by robinson yet<br>but we are pretty close so the message<br>about<br>climate change is quite clear i think<br>the message about<br>covert and science is a bit different<br>so sort of a way one of the messages of<br>this altera ministry of the future<br>should be we've got to listen to the<br>experts and<br>the relationship between ashley<br>bloomfield and jacinda<br>dern during the covert you know<br>management of covert was as<br>a model so if we could basically<br>replicate that<br>everywhere in the world should replicate<br>that relationship<br>but also for different kinds of<br>challenges we need a different kind of<br>graduate<br>and a different kind of thinking so i<br>want to sort of in a way say that our<br>major<br>kind of imaginative capital<br>is the power of our young minds to<br>basically think up mad crazy<br>ideas um and we need to encourage that<br>we will be underinsured for the future<br>okay so here's where the difference is<br>and basically i think<br>right now i mean climate change is<br>undeniable i mean no one can<br>just you can wish it away politicians<br>love ignoring it<br>very few of them are brave enough to<br>outright deny it<br>but there's kind of a different message<br>i mean that's basically we know we have<br>to listen to the scientists and it's<br>really clear<br>in kim stanley robinson's book but the<br>message about covert 19<br>and is a bit different and i'm just<br>thinking about sort of in a way ian<br>mentioned well look there i have been<br>warnings<br>but there's a strong narrative that come<br>came from science<br>which kind of got it up got it you know<br>the message about pandemics and<br>potential pandemics got caught up<br>in this triumphalist message about<br>scientific progress<br>so 2018 a very influential book<br>by stephen fink pinker from harvard<br>official super smart guy<br>basically said don't worry about<br>pandemics i mean they can happen<br>but we've got them we're much better at<br>this<br>and well you know part of progress you<br>get better i mean this is the same kind<br>of reading for the same text that says<br>soon we'll cue<br>we'll find a cure for cancer part of the<br>good news<br>you know diseases don't become pandemics<br>and i took that seriously um i thought<br>well<br>whew god wuhan that sounds bad but i<br>just finished<br>stephen pinker's book not to worry the<br>scientists have got this<br>so what we how do we counteract this<br>when we have a powerful i mean<br>stephen pinker sold a lot of books with<br>this feel-good message<br>i think we need to invest in imagination<br>insurance<br>and the imagination and imagine when you<br>have imagination insurance it's not like<br>health insurance<br>if someone's trying to sell you health<br>insurance well they do depress you a bit<br>they tell you about all the things that<br>can grow wrong they say what happens if<br>you get cancer<br>you know what happens with that what<br>happens if you get a terrible other<br>terrible disease what happens if you get<br>parkinson's<br>and you're supposed to think about that<br>do i have coverage for those<br>possibilities<br>so the kind of imagination insurance<br>that i'm talking about and i hope would<br>be encouraged by this university and<br>would staff<br>an alter ministry for the future would<br>be<br>basically saying well look we need to<br>imagine<br>these possibilities both horrible and<br>good<br>in order to ensure against and for them<br>and i think there's a resource that we<br>have here that we don't<br>hear enough of and that's basically um<br>we have<br>a real advantage in the diversity of our<br>minds i mean<br>we need to ask i went to tonga and i<br>people are young people in tongara i was<br>invited to give a talk about the future<br>young people in tonga are terrified of<br>climate change much more so<br>than new zealanders because it's not<br>just a bit of a matter of coastal<br>erosion<br>it's the end of tongatapu and they said<br>things to me that we're surprising<br>i'll just cancel that and<br>i i think we need more of that and<br>uh let's pay some young marion pacifica<br>people to think up<br>to write science fiction read kim<br>stanley robinson think it do some<br>science fiction<br>nick thank you very much for this<br>fascinating contribution and especially<br>um highlighting the involvement of<br>marion pacifica communities<br>within that especially challenging<br>context<br>for our final speaker today we have i'm<br>jonathan boston professor of public<br>policy thank you so much for taking the<br>time<br>um enhancing anticipatory governance<br>jonathan over to you thank you<br>thanks ina uh kiara everyone uh<br>next slide please xena i'm wanting to<br>talk about<br>uh the problem of how do we protect the<br>interests<br>of our future selves and future<br>generations<br>so rather than thinking primarily about<br>the nature of futures<br>or foresight i'm i'm really wanting to<br>think about<br>the the challenges we face in in a world<br>with multiple<br>and very serious risks of the kind that<br>previous speakers have mentioned like<br>climate change<br>antimicrobial resistance and the<br>potential<br>damaging impacts of things like<br>artificial intelligence on the<br>democratic process<br>i'm concerned with how do we protect uh<br>long-term interests and there's a<br>variety of ways in which we can frame<br>that problem and i've listed a variety<br>of ways that will be familiar to many<br>people it may be focusing on<br>stewardship or sustainability or or the<br>simple question but a very fundamentally<br>difficult one how do we bring the long<br>term<br>into short-term political focus how do<br>we deal with the problem of<br>political short-termism but specifically<br>for this session i want to focus on<br>the concept of anticipatory governance<br>and ask how do we enhance anticipatory<br>governance and this i think will<br>resonate with what nick has just been<br>talking about in relation to the use of<br>imagination a wonderful quality that<br>human beings embrace next slide please<br>there are a variety of definitions that<br>you'll find in the academic literature<br>as to what anticipatory governance is<br>it's a relatively new concept but it's<br>increasingly<br>widely used across multiple disciplines<br>david gunson here wrote some 10 years<br>ago that anticipatory governance<br>is he says a broadly based capacity<br>extended through society that can<br>act on a variety of inputs to manage<br>emerging knowledge based<br>in technologies while such management is<br>still<br>possible so his focus was very much on<br>the disruptive effects or the<br>potentially disruptive effects of<br>technologies<br>and and how we might um manage those<br>effects<br>and mitigate some of their negative<br>impacts next slide please<br>uh other contributors to the discussions<br>about the nature of anticipatory<br>governments have taken a rather broader<br>approach so leon firth who advised al<br>gore<br>when he was vice president some 20 plus<br>years ago in the united states said<br>of anticipating governance that it's a<br>system of institutions rules and norms<br>that provide a way to use foresight<br>for the purpose of reducing risk and to<br>increase the capacity to respond to<br>events at<br>early rather than later stages of their<br>development whether that's a pandemic<br>or whether it's climate change or some<br>other some other problem<br>uh next slide please uh<br>i've had a go at coming up with my own<br>definition i'm not going to go through<br>this in detail<br>but simply to say there's a there's a<br>there's a way of perhaps<br>broadening the concept of of<br>anticipatory governance beyond what um<br>gunson and even sirth have suggested uh<br>and to incorporate a number of elements<br>and i want to just talk about some of<br>those briefly next slide please<br>so as we think about anticipatory<br>governance<br>what might be some of its core<br>attributes here i've suggested there are<br>at least eight this is not by any means<br>necessarily complete but they include an<br>emphasis on foresight<br>which malcolm and ian have talked about<br>and the related techniques of foresight<br>which were mentioned very briefly by<br>malcolm<br>an anticipated approach in my view must<br>embrace a precautionary approach to<br>governing<br>and be involved in taking proactive<br>rather than simply reactive<br>uh policy measures it needs to be<br>holistic<br>involving a a systems approach in which<br>you recognize interdependencies<br>it needs to be adaptive it needs to<br>be very concerned about a number of<br>critical goals such as resilience<br>and sustainability it needs in my view<br>to be<br>embracing participatory modes of<br>decision making because if you can't<br>take people with you then you can't<br>govern well for the future<br>and it needs to embed long-term<br>interests in day-to-day decision-making<br>how might those attributes be translated<br>into<br>better governance including in a country<br>like new zealand<br>next slide please well there's a variety<br>of things<br>one can do in my view there's no single<br>solution<br>or silver bullet trying to improve<br>the way we safeguard future interests is<br>challenging<br>and we need to deploy the full range of<br>available uh techniques institutions and<br>options we have available to us<br>so amongst other things we could think<br>about extending the parliamentary term<br>in new zealand which is very short by<br>international standards and i'm pleased<br>to see<br>that both descender and uh and judith<br>support that the challenge will be to<br>get public support for that<br>uh in a referendum we need in my view to<br>embed the future within our democratic<br>institutions and policy processes<br>through a series of what can be called<br>commitment devices that is devices that<br>require people to do things to set<br>targets<br>to report results and so on and so forth<br>we need to improve the system's capacity<br>for foresight<br>and malcolm and others have mentioned<br>that we need to<br>improve uh the quality of our futures<br>thinking across our governmental systems<br>central government local government and<br>so forth we need in my view to<br>strengthen the institutional voices<br>for the future now that includes<br>institutions like the parliamentary<br>commission<br>uh for the commissioner for the future<br>the children's commissioner it could<br>include a ministry for the future<br>although i<br>have to say nick i have some<br>reservations about that idea<br>we need to embed the future within our<br>policy frameworks and analytical<br>techniques<br>uh the way we think about discounting<br>for example the way we think about<br>valuing nature for example<br>and finally and really crucially we need<br>to nurture a political culture that<br>facilitates<br>durable political bargains on important<br>intergenerational issues<br>such as climate change such as<br>population aging such as<br>rapid technological change and it's<br>going to be really interesting to see to<br>what extend over the coming years in new<br>zealand with this new<br>uh parliament we now have to what extent<br>uh jacinda can secure support across the<br>political spectrum for some of the<br>critical<br>policy decisions that would need to be<br>taken in order to protect<br>the interests of ourselves here in new<br>zealand but also the interests of<br>those who will live in these lands in<br>jonathan thank you very much also to all<br>our speakers<br>we now have a solid amount of time left<br>for a hopefully lively and interesting q<br>a<br>so for the audience if there are any<br>questions you'd like to post to any of<br>our speakers or all of them<br>please do pop them in the q a function<br>we have one question<br>in there at the moment and for mary mary<br>paul asks and is the exponential state<br>of technology development a commonly<br>accepted axiom or is it someone's<br>hypothesis<br>and over what time scale is this<br>relationship thought to have held and to<br>hold in the future<br>could it perhaps be like a biological<br>population explosion and collapse<br>thanks that's that's a great question<br>and i think it's partly a function of<br>of the uncertainty which is one of the<br>things that's come through the panel<br>that it's<br>it's really very hard to answer i would<br>just<br>i'll just post this actually um hold on<br>um i did yeah i just<br>put some uh notes together uh from<br>seeing the questions so these are just<br>sources that i<br>have found to be influential and useful<br>so<br>in terms of is it a consensus um i think<br>that by the time something is getting<br>published in nature<br>it's got pretty broad traction in the<br>scientific community<br>so you know whether it could be<br>described as a consensus i'm not sure<br>but it would it's certainly something<br>that's taken<br>very very seriously um you know<br>what with that with a wide degree of<br>acceptance<br>um in terms of what's going to happen<br>uh i have found a very influential<br>and i really recommend them to people<br>who are interested in these<br>sort of topics um a novel<br>noah yuval harari's really interesting<br>books um sapiens and homodaeus<br>and and homodayus in particular he he<br>really<br>tries to answer this question about you<br>know like<br>where's this all going and what he<br>believes is that we are actually going<br>to see<br>a new type of technologically enhanced<br>humans<br>that are capable of things that exceed<br>what we normally accept is the<br>limitations of<br>our physical bodies and minds so<br>that being the case i mean if that is<br>at all a realistic prediction then i i<br>think<br>we can expect to see this exhilarating<br>change um continuing um<br>i i i guess other people have read um<br>harari do any of the rest of you want to<br>comment on<br>on on his uh his predictions about where<br>nika i'm sure you've did we have a<br>conversation about harare at some stage<br>um uh not not we haven't i know the view<br>and i guess it's a pretty exciting and<br>sometimes scary future that he describes<br>and it's one in which we may surrender<br>authority<br>of many of our actions and choices to<br>machines which are much more intelligent<br>than us and that's<br>as to whether that's a good prediction<br>i think that's one thing but it's<br>certainly something if you have<br>imagination insurance<br>and you think well that could happen<br>should we prepare for it<br>i don't know my my cancer will be<br>treated by a superintellig<br>intelligent machine it will i don't know<br>what its priorities are<br>and that's certainly a good question to<br>ask<br>all right thank you very much we've had<br>a second question pop up in the q a not<br>targeted towards anyone in particular<br>so um potentially nick and jonathan<br>based on the focus of your talks um jose<br>asks if the new public service act<br>requirements for public sector cias to<br>report on future issues<br>but solve this or perhaps contribute to<br>this<br>well you know perhaps if i begin uh<br>just to clarify for listeners what the<br>public service act now requires so<br>first of all it has increased the<br>emphasis on the concept of stewardship<br>uh in the act and in particular the<br>stewardship<br>the responsibilities of departmental<br>chief executives<br>along with the commissioner<br>for the public service public service<br>commissioner but it's also<br>uh introduced a new requirement which is<br>for<br>departmental chief executives to produce<br>periodic<br>uh long-term insight briefings these<br>have to be produced<br>at least once every three years and can<br>be produced either<br>individually by individual chief<br>executives in their departments<br>or collectively now the question<br>really is well what difference might<br>these uh so-called long-term insight<br>briefings make<br>the act is fairly open-ended<br>as to exactly what these documents<br>should cover it says they need to look<br>at long-term trends risks and<br>opportunities<br>and it gives the departments the right<br>to<br>comment on the uh<br>various ways in which some of the<br>problems that they've identified<br>can be addressed but it specifically<br>forbids departmental chief executives<br>from<br>offering specific advice or making<br>specific<br>recommendations though obviously if you<br>analyze<br>options and consider their strengths and<br>weaknesses<br>which the act facilitates then<br>then it may be reasonably obvious to any<br>reader what what the preferred option<br>might be<br>my hope is that the requirement to<br>produce these documents will have a<br>number of positive effects first of all<br>it will require departments to do some<br>serious thinking about the specific<br>trends risks and opportunities in their<br>areas of responsibility whether they do<br>this individually or jointly is going to<br>be a matter for<br>some debate over coming months so that<br>hopefully will focus the minds<br>of officials including senior officials<br>on some of the really big challenges<br>in their policy domain the second<br>hope for benefit is that these documents<br>will be published<br>hopefully ministers will read them and<br>hopefully members of the public will<br>read them<br>but but thirdly there's going to be a<br>requirement under the new standing<br>orders of the parliament for these<br>documents to be<br>sent to the governance and<br>administration committee of the house<br>and for that committee then to review<br>these documents or send them on to<br>other departments with sorry other<br>select committees with a requirement to<br>report back<br>to the house so the hope is that there<br>will be a parliamentary process<br>which will involve scrutiny of the<br>contents of these documents<br>and that that will first of all raise<br>the sort of parliamentary awareness<br>of big long-term issues risks and<br>opportunities<br>but also uh kind of send some signals<br>back through the wider political system<br>and raise the the quality of debate<br>so so the short answer is i hope<br>this particular new policy instrument<br>will make a difference<br>uh but we'll have to wait and see there<br>is always a risk there<br>to some extent as has happened with the<br>requirement for the treasury to produce<br>its long-term fiscal<br>statements that departments do worthy<br>work<br>uh but they then the documents they<br>produce basically just gather dust on<br>a shelf somewhere so a key a key<br>uh issue in this particular case is how<br>can i just say add something to the<br>great points that jonathan's made<br>um i think one of the challenges i guess<br>in a way why<br>it would be great to have something like<br>a ministry is that<br>oh you know future people people born<br>100 years ago<br>don't vote they won't vote in the next<br>election<br>so we do have a tendency to discount<br>their interests it's impossible for us<br>not to<br>we leave them problems and trust that<br>they'll be richer than us we hope and<br>have better technologies and we'll be<br>able to solve them<br>so i guess in a way it would be great if<br>in a way we<br>responded we'll always give future<br>people tripped<br>and i guess it would be great to have<br>some kind of mechanism that would sort<br>of look at these<br>this document and say well okay i'm<br>speaking on behalf of<br>people born 50 years from now i find<br>their interests insufficiently protected<br>so that would be a test i'd like to uh<br>or impose<br>on or expect of this but i add on to<br>that um<br>just a question to jonathan um jonathan<br>within the public service act and the<br>framework you're presenting<br>um in the terms of<br>responsibilities what is the degree of<br>creativity or degree of<br>thinking the unthinkable or the more<br>wild cards<br>um within that or is it or is it very<br>much a framework<br>within rationality and evidence-based<br>and<br>uncertainty<br>uh ian uh<br>departments obviously operate within a<br>kind of authorizing environment<br>um in the political domain in which uh<br>they tend to be uh politically sensitive<br>and if you like risk-averse and i think<br>as<br>departmental chief executives prepare<br>these new<br>um policy statements these long-term<br>insight briefings they're going to be<br>mindful of the<br>of the risks that they're running<br>uh if they fly too many kites if you<br>like if they think<br>uh too many unthinkable thoughts so<br>i think if you like one of the risks in<br>all this is that<br>uh these or at least some of these<br>documents may be<br>uh rather tame in nature and<br>and part of the challenge is going to be<br>how do we how do we if you like you know<br>push<br>push the um the imagination forward<br>and and avoid undue risk aversion<br>now there are two or three things that<br>might help mitigate<br>that concern i've just raised the first<br>is the the act<br>does require uh that the<br>um that departmental chief executives<br>consult the public<br>on on the issues that uh<br>members of the public think these<br>documents should cover<br>and secondly uh draft documents have to<br>be circulated for comment<br>so that provides an opportunity for<br>people like you and i and many others<br>of course to uh to say look you you<br>aren't taking some of these issues<br>seriously you aren't thinking outside<br>the square<br>et cetera et cetera secondly because<br>these documents have to be reviewed by<br>parliament<br>then there's the opportunity for<br>pushback there and if departments are<br>seen to be<br>unduly kind of conservative in the way<br>they're approaching the task<br>and in not taking if you like<br>big issues seriously enough then of<br>course they run the risk<br>of of being criticized by parliamentary<br>select committees<br>and indeed by the wider public so so<br>you know uh there's going to be kind of<br>pressures operating<br>in in a variety of directions here can i<br>just comment very briefly<br>if you don't mind ina on nick's proposal<br>for a ministry for the future<br>i i do think there's a case for uh<br>an independent body to speak on behalf<br>of future generations whether you want<br>to call it a commissioner for future<br>generations<br>or a commission for the future or<br>something like that i do think there's a<br>case for that but we have to remember<br>that the parliamentary commissioner for<br>the environment<br>as a spokesperson if you like as a voice<br>for protecting the environment<br>is is doing quite a lot of that job<br>right now<br>so if you created a new institution<br>you'd have to say well you know how<br>you're going to divide up<br>you know the policy space the problem i<br>have with a ministry<br>for the future is that ministries of<br>course<br>are all involved at the moment in the<br>future<br>so a critical question would be well if<br>you're going to have a ministry for the<br>future alongside your treasury and your<br>ministry for social development and<br>department of education<br>and health and all the rest of it what<br>would the ministry of the future or for<br>the future do<br>what would be its sort of beginning<br>point and what would be its end point<br>and how do you avoid just having an<br>enormous amount of overlap<br>so uh my my preference would be to say<br>we need to encourage<br>all our government departments and ages<br>agencies to be future focused<br>not not just put it all in into one<br>uh one basket if you like and then<br>expect that ministry to somehow<br>uh cope with all the issues that<br>are going to affect the future<br>you know can i say something yes um<br>also nick i don't know whether you're<br>aware there are<br>wales has a commissioner for future<br>generations so there's a precedent<br>for that it's not a ministry but a<br>commissioner i just want to say<br>in response to jose's question<br>about whether the new public service act<br>requirements<br>uh for long-term insight briefings would<br>would<br>solve this solve the requirement that<br>we've identified well<br>i think drawing on what jonathan says<br>those statements will be part of the<br>solution but not enough and<br>going back to my ecosystem metaphor<br>i think we still need<br>some kind of capability to ensure that<br>those<br>insight briefings are uh<br>framed in future terms i mean there's a<br>lot of conceptual work to go on there<br>and also that there are other staff<br>available i know i know<br>already that there's a real shortage of<br>capability in the sector to generate<br>those<br>um and you know to make sure that they<br>don't turn into<br>planning documents of the type that<br>haven't really worked in the past<br>so and alongside that of course there<br>are also<br>all the other initiatives that are going<br>on more independent initiatives that<br>need to be<br>factored in and that's where i think<br>some sort of oversight mechanism would<br>be valuable<br>um i i share jonathan's reservations<br>about<br>a ministry for future thinking of the<br>future but i could cite<br>um jim data's second law of futures<br>thinking which is more well known than<br>the first one that he en quoted he said<br>that any idea about the future to be<br>useful<br>may i ask my my fellow panelists we had<br>a<br>great discussion about the role of<br>government and<br>this may be cracking the whole issue<br>open sort of even wider but<br>we've observed that there's a global<br>trend for<br>rulers and and governments um<br>and it seems to me that that partly<br>represents an anxiety<br>or difficulty in in dealing with change<br>and uncertainty<br>is there like what can governments or<br>educators or influences in general<br>do to help people engage uh<br>constructively and to deal with<br>with with this level of uncertainty that<br>well perhaps i can say something maybe<br>just to modify and response<br>to the good points made about the call<br>from ministry<br>i guess in a way anything that i think<br>that gives so<br>current people people here and now have<br>carry quite a lot of weight with<br>politicians and policy makers<br>so i guess anything that gives future<br>generations sufficient<br>um to account for something would be<br>great for me<br>and i think the great i find the the<br>future quite a great uniform<br>because it's not just the environment<br>right i mean it's<br>it's also i don't know covert 25<br>whatever that is i mean it's a whole<br>collection it's it's<br>robots i mean it's so yeah it's a whole<br>lot of issues<br>that basically are unified by this<br>common interest so<br>anything i guess that gives what we're<br>talking about i mean i love your points<br>jonathan and<br>yeah i mean i you don't want it to be<br>business if you as usual<br>here's another whatever let's ignore it<br>um anything that gives it sufficient<br>uh you know could i just comment on<br>mary's question<br>um it's a huge topic mary and i'll just<br>be<br>very brief i i think the threat to<br>democratic governance from a range of<br>anti-democratic<br>entity sort of populist movements is a<br>very serious threat<br>and and is probably equally as<br>concerning as<br>as coveted or some of the other<br>challenges we face<br>that's not as serious as uh climate<br>change because that really does<br>pose existential threats to humanity but<br>there's a very good book by michael<br>sandell a harvard philosopher<br>called the tyranny of merit and uh<br>he provides i think a very thoughtful uh<br>and robust uh explanation<br>uh for the rise of populist movements in<br>the united states and parts of europe<br>and and<br>the core of his uh analysis is that<br>the fruits of globalization have been<br>captured by<br>the sort of business and political elite<br>uh<br>and not properly distributed across the<br>general population<br>and that's markedly the case in the<br>united states where<br>you know almost all the fruits of 40<br>years of productivity growth have gone<br>to the top<br>one or two percentage of the of the<br>population<br>creating gross extraordinary<br>income and wealth inequality and his<br>second point is the strong emphasis<br>over recent decades on on meritocratic<br>um values in in which in which people<br>somehow think that they deserve<br>the rewards they receive because of<br>their<br>apparent efforts or contribution to<br>society<br>but the implication of that is that the<br>people who haven't benefited<br>benefited over the last 40 years deserve<br>their failure<br>deserve to be losers and you know trump<br>and<br>and other populists like like him around<br>the world have played to those fears<br>and to to the people who feel that<br>they've lost<br>and and who feel that they are demeaned<br>by the elites<br>so a very good book i'd recommend it and<br>it may not be by any means the full<br>answer but i think sandal provides a<br>very<br>a very robust uh explanation and the<br>solution of course is we need to<br>redistribute income and wealth<br>all right um jonathan ian mary nick<br>malcolm thank you so much for taking the<br>time today for contributing<br>for this excellent and insightful<br>discussion that hopefully um lots of us<br>are taking away<br>to reconsider how we're going to<br>progress through our day-to-day lives<br>our professional lives will help you in<br>the future<br>thank you so much to all
