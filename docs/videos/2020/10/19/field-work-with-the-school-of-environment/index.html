font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>on the 10th of september<br>last year the school of environment at<br>the university of auckland<br>organized a field trip to the south<br>island to see firsthand the impact that<br>the 2016 earthquakes had made to the<br>landscape<br>we packed our bags and flew all the way<br>down to christchurch airport<br>and after a quick footstop and a bite to<br>destination<br>oh<br>so the aim of the class is to introduce<br>students to applied<br>aspects of what can be a fairly<br>theoretical<br>field give them a sense of how some of<br>these theoretical<br>components come together when we're<br>trying to manage river systems that have<br>been<br>impacted in various ways it's a great<br>landscape to work in to<br>see some really extreme changes in river<br>systems<br>having the opportunity to interact with<br>the amazing geology in kaikoura<br>really brought the theory to life i<br>became familiar with many essential<br>field practices<br>and tramping up the linton river below<br>colossal land sites<br>crystallized all that we've been<br>learning throughout the year<br>what we've really seen in this system is<br>that the dam is moving through really<br>fast so it's really good that we can get<br>in there and get the data<br>now before the pulse moves in any<br>further downstream<br>and starts to affect roads and other<br>people around here<br>it was a unique opportunity to apply a<br>varied range of practices and tests<br>to do this we had access to use of the<br>art technologies<br>some of which had been developed by the<br>university's in-house technical<br>engineers<br>so this is essentially a base receiver<br>and this<br>this machine talks to this machine so<br>when we're out in the field we can<br>collect a<br>real-time gps points so when we're<br>doing our drone survey we can<br>essentially geo-reference<br>the photos that we take to those points<br>so we've got<br>the drone at about 15 meters elevation<br>that's taking really high resolution<br>images of<br>all the sediments around us so that then<br>i can go and stitch them all together<br>and create<br>a model a 3d model of what's changing in<br>this system<br>uh so we're really excited to get this<br>kind of really high resolution imagery<br>because it allows us to do things that<br>you know even five years ago we couldn't<br>have dreamed of doing<br>kakota is one of the most stunning<br>places in the world and to be able to<br>study among the snow dusted peaks and<br>crystal clear rivers was a real<br>privilege<br>without a doubt the field trip to<br>kaikoura was a highlight in studying in<br>the school of environment<br>not only was it a great learning<br>experience and one of the world's most<br>beautiful environments<br>but bonding with classmates traveling<br>together cooking meals and coming<br>together like a family<br>made it an experience i won't soon<br>forget<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
