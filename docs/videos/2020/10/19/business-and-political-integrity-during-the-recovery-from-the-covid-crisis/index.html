The crisis has required the Government to make quick decisions and implement drastic measures to protect communities. Without resilient and robust safeguards, our recovery is vulnerable to abuse.<br><br>How might we ensure business and political integrity in our recovery?<br><br>In this recorded discussion hosted by Transparency International New Zealand and the Brian Picot Chair of Ethical Leadership, 2020 Election Candidates from across Wellington  share their insights and perspectives on business and political

warm welcome from the brian picocher<br>and ethical leadership<br>the wellington school of business and<br>government and from our partner<br>transparency international new zealand<br>i'm so pleased to see you all here in<br>rutherford house<br>and at one of the first in-house events<br>since the covet 19 outbreak<br>and i hope that you all enjoy this<br>evening and will take some time to catch<br>up with others<br>afterwards over refreshments and drinks<br>as you might have noticed this event<br>will be recorded<br>and there are also some photographs<br>taken<br>and we also welcome the journalist in<br>the room<br>the brian pikachu and ethical leadership<br>hopes to provide<br>knowledge and insights based on evidence<br>that can improve governance and business<br>practices and help mitigate ethical<br>risks<br>in our society so we want to contribute<br>towards<br>sustaining new zealand's good ethical<br>reputation<br>and one of the ways to do so is to<br>facilitate<br>frank and free discussions about<br>important ethical issues<br>one of these important issues is our<br>recovery from<br>covet 19 and the approach we will take<br>the covet 19 outbreak has changed our<br>world in unprecedented ways<br>and the pandemic has placed<br>extraordinary demands<br>on leaders in government and business<br>and in the wider community<br>while many countries are now facing a<br>second wave of the virus<br>new zealand is among the first in a<br>position to move from dealing with the<br>crisis<br>to navigating our recovery this will<br>undoubtedly<br>be a daunting challenge and ethical<br>leadership<br>is needed as the moral compass for the<br>many<br>difficult trade-offs and choices to be<br>made<br>and to protect our number one ethical<br>reputation in the world that is<br>essential<br>for economic recovery in new zealand<br>we are fortunate to have so many leaders<br>with strong ethical values and practices<br>who act with integrity within the public<br>service<br>private sector in our communities and i<br>believe<br>that new zealand has the opportunity to<br>lead the world<br>in setting a good example we certainly<br>cannot be avoided to be complacent<br>because in times of crisis<br>there are far greater risks for<br>integrity violations to arise<br>in terms of the incentives the<br>opportunities<br>and rationalizations of wrongdoing so<br>now<br>more than ever integrity and<br>transparency need to be high on the<br>agenda<br>we will hear from our five political<br>candidates<br>honourable andrew little honorable james<br>shaw<br>jessica hammond fletcher tabito<br>and david patterson how they see their<br>ethical leadership role<br>and how they reflect on business and<br>political integrity<br>during the recovery from the covet<br>crisis<br>when they will be interviewed by ian<br>fraser who will ask a few<br>tough questions thank you so much for<br>being with us<br>here tonight i'm also honored now

accountability<br>and all of those really important<br>values that we pride ourselves on as<br>being a fair little country<br>out here in the pacific so i'm just<br>going to give you a bit of an overview<br>and i<br>will just also add that if you do need<br>to use the bathrooms they're just<br>straight out the store<br>and on either sides of the lift if you<br>need those um and they are accessible<br>to anybody in a wheelchair um awesome<br>so basically we'll crack right into it<br>um so tonight<br>we kyota welcome to all of our wonderful<br>speakers uh<br>they will have two and a half minutes uh<br>to give their pitch uh on those topics<br>that i just talked about before<br>and then we have four specialized<br>questions for them as well which will be<br>delivered by ian<br>and then following that we will take<br>some questions and answers<br>from the floor we have some that have<br>already come in today so<br>thank you to um those who have sent<br>those in but we will also take some from<br>the floor if there's<br>time for that as well so i'm going to<br>start by introducing<br>our candidates for the evening who will<br>then<br>give us a two and a half minute pitch<br>about their party's positions on<br>those values of transparency and<br>integrity and then i'm going to pass it<br>over to ian<br>so i'm going to start off by introducing<br>the honourable andrew little so andrew<br>little is a current member of parliament<br>having studied here<br>at victoria university of wellington<br>completing a bachelor of laws and<br>bachelor of arts<br>andrew became a lawyer with the<br>engineers union before being appointed<br>the engineering printing and<br>manufacturing union national secretary<br>andrew has divided his devoted his life<br>to advocating for new zealanders<br>entering parliament in 2011 with a<br>mission to leave behind a better country<br>today his ministerial portfolios include<br>justice workplace relations and safety<br>treaty of waitangi negotiations and the<br>government communications security<br>bureau<br>and also andrew was born in new plymouth<br>but calls<br>te whanganguyatara or wellington his<br>home so kyota andrew and<br>suzanne will you be timing awesome cool<br>if you could just give andrew a signal<br>when his<br>is that can you hear me can i is this<br>guy this guy okay all right thank you<br>alex good evening thank you timothy and<br>good evening<br>ian and my colleagues um and good<br>evening to all of you too<br>a couple of things i just want to cover<br>off first of all is uh in a sense<br>the decision-making that took us through<br>the cover 19 pandemic and new zealand's<br>response to it and then secondly<br>uh the challenges that uh remain as we<br>now kind of<br>uh seek to get out of it those<br>challenges are not just economic they<br>are social as well<br>the significance of talking about how we<br>made decisions the basis on which we<br>made decisions<br>is about what sets us up for that future<br>and our recovery<br>uh both social and economic it was very<br>clear very early in the year<br>that this challenge was on us i remember<br>well remember the first<br>emergency cabinet meeting that was<br>called on a saturday evening first of<br>february<br>uh where when countries were considering<br>closing their borders at least in part<br>to other countries and we had to start<br>making some decisions along that line<br>right from then and every decision that<br>the government of the day made was based<br>on the signs<br>the medical advice that we received and<br>it was important<br>that we got the balance of making sure<br>we were informed scientifically and<br>medically informed<br>and that the political considerations<br>that we were taking into account<br>weren't ones that were about kind of<br>setting ourselves off against each other<br>but about the judgments about what you<br>know how how we are effective<br>how we're going to communicate and how<br>we bring people with us and that was the<br>basis on which we made decisions<br>and and got our way through to the point<br>we are today where like many other<br>countries<br>not only having been afflicted with it<br>but afflicted with it more than<br>more than once but we have in terms of<br>where we're at<br>uh casualties fatalities impact on the<br>economy<br>we are way ahead of pretty much every<br>other country in the world<br>what that has enabled us to do what one<br>of the effects of that is that it has<br>uh considerably enhanced new zealand's<br>reputation abroad<br>that will help us in terms of our<br>economic and social recovery we already<br>know from some<br>exporters they're telling us that there<br>is now a premium attached particularly<br>to our food and beverage exports<br>because we are seen as a safe country<br>and a healthy country from which<br>those products originate we are also<br>seen as a safe country in which to<br>invest<br>because of the the quality of the<br>leadership people experience is it a<br>warning or an end<br>that's the end but you get the general<br>drift<br>and i'll have more to say throughout the<br>awesome<br>all right so that's the sound to look<br>out for um so now we're going to go to<br>the<br>other side of the room to the honorable<br>james shaw so<br>james is also a current member of<br>parliament and prior to becoming an mp<br>james had a successful career in<br>management consulting primarily in<br>london<br>james worked with large multinational<br>companies across europe and around the<br>world helping them develop more<br>sustainable business practices<br>completing his undergraduate at victoria<br>university of wellington he completed<br>his masters in sustainability and<br>business leadership<br>at the university of bath school of<br>management<br>james was appointed green party<br>co-leader on may 30th<br>2015 after being elected to parliament<br>as a list mp in 2014<br>and then in 2017 james was appointed<br>minister for climate change minister of<br>statistics and<br>um good evening so transparency and<br>accountability have been<br>uh values that the green party has<br>championed um both before we got into<br>parliament<br>uh and in the 20 years that we were in<br>parliament and an opposition and again<br>once we<br>made the transition to being a party of<br>government just in this last term since<br>2017<br>back in the 2000s we unilaterally made<br>the decision to<br>publish our mp's expenses and that led<br>to a reform of<br>the whole system so now all mp's<br>expenses are um<br>are published just as a matter of course<br>um<br>during this time in government um we<br>made the decision to publish our<br>minister's diaries<br>uh and within a few months that became<br>the standard minister of course that our<br>our full diaries are published<br>um after you know um a period of time<br>has passed<br>uh and um we we actually started off by<br>giving our patsy questions<br>uh to the opposition um until they told<br>us that they didn't want them anymore<br>because and and so we ended up taking<br>them uh taking them back because we felt<br>that as a party of government that<br>actually one of the roles of<br>accountability should be that it should<br>be<br>the opposition should be taking question<br>time to ask those questions rather than<br>the government asking patsy<br>questions of themselves<br>now our belief is that that helps to<br>build a more transparent more robust<br>democratic system there are other things<br>that we<br>would like to see uh parliament<br>introduce and and and<br>government introduce uh in the future as<br>well but we think it's more important<br>that we have a culture in the country<br>that is founded on those<br>principles and actually we are very<br>lucky uh in new zealand<br>and i do say lucky actually given uh<br>what the<br>counterfactual is around the world um<br>because it<br>is actually important to our<br>economy um and to our society as well<br>the example that i would use would be<br>say well who would you like to program<br>your security software a new zealand<br>company<br>or a russian company right and so<br>and i say this with all due respect to<br>any russians in the room<br>but it has a huge<br>impact um the whether or not that<br>company<br>you know in either case uh has any form<br>of malpractice<br>the reputation of a country in terms of<br>its transparency and its openness and<br>its integrity makes a huge difference in<br>terms of the dealings that we have<br>um with the rest of the world so when i<br>talk about the things that we would like<br>to do<br>in government for us that is actually<br>about bolstering not just our democratic<br>system<br>awesome thank you next up we are going<br>to<br>fletcher tabuto so fledja tabito is the<br>deputy leader of the new zealand first<br>party he serves as the parliamentary<br>under secretary for<br>foreign affairs disarmament and arms<br>control and regional economic<br>development<br>in this current parliamentary term mr<br>tabito has held a range of spokesperson<br>roles including<br>associate finance commerce revenue trade<br>tourism and<br>energy fletcher was also the deputy<br>chair of the finance and expenditure<br>select committee<br>and mrs tabuto has been a member of new<br>zealand first since the party's<br>inception in 1993<br>and joined parliament in 2014. fletcher<br>was a lecturer in<br>economics and business and has had<br>previous experience as a business<br>consultant as well as a<br>as 10 years as a new zealand business<br>mentor and finally<br>fletcher is from rotorua and is of<br>ngating<br>thank you for the introduction and can i<br>simply start off by<br>thank you thanking you all for being<br>here tonight<br>really all i wanted to say by way of<br>introduction<br>was to have the conversation around<br>accountability ethical government<br>ethical business<br>transparency and accountability and the<br>reason i say that<br>is because it's something that we can't<br>let slip that we can't take for granted<br>in this modern day and age and<br>unfortunately<br>uh there are examples of a standing<br>president contesting<br>um already contesting the grounds of an<br>election<br>outcome coming up in terms of respecting<br>the result<br>and that i know it puts a<br>huge amount of fear into me and i know<br>it will put a huge amount of fear into<br>the people around the world<br>and so i as the minister deputy minister<br>of foreign affairs i've traveled the<br>world<br>and my motivation on return is always to<br>come back and find a crowd<br>to be able to say we don't know how<br>lucky we are<br>but this room probably does know how<br>lucky we are<br>um and it's incredible in terms of<br>what the minister of foreign affairs<br>often says the rest of the world's a<br>hellhole<br>and we we don't know how lucky we are in<br>new zealand and it is because of the<br>democracy we uphold<br>the integrity with which we operate the<br>accountability<br>in the system in which our politicians<br>and businesses operate<br>knowing that there's an accountability<br>system and i passionately stand here in<br>front of you saying<br>we must defend that we must not take it<br>for granted<br>and we must continue to ensure that it<br>evolves<br>and seeing as i have a little bit of<br>time left i'd like to acknowledge<br>the minister here in terms of our covert<br>response<br>with new zealand first ministers in the<br>cabinet room making these incredibly<br>difficult calls<br>on how to respond to covert i wasn't in<br>the room so i'm allowed to say it was a<br>master class<br>and it means that we're able to<br>congregate here tonight<br>and have this discussion amongst<br>ourselves and<br>and do so knowing that we can go home<br>well and uh and and good sound mind<br>hopefully so<br>look thank you so much for being here i<br>look forward to answering your questions<br>and uh the questions from the audience i<br>should have said<br>shilla said should have said bulavanaka<br>fijian language<br>thank you and now we're going to go on<br>to jessica heaven so jessica<br>is the opportunity party's candidate for<br>ohario uh here in wellington<br>uh where she is standing for the second<br>time she has been a public servant for<br>16 years advising many ministers across<br>several government<br>departments she has a master's in<br>philosophy<br>specializing in applied ethics jessica<br>is passionate about<br>strong public institutions and believes<br>we have a responsibility to<br>those who can't vote so that's children<br>future generations and other species<br>that have a stake in this country<br>and just wanted to say thank you for<br>being the only woman on this panel<br>tonight as well kyoto jessica floor is<br>yours<br>thanks tamitha um yeah so uh yeah i'm<br>very proud to be<br>um the opportunities party candidate for<br>ohio for the second time<br>and um you know to be among this exalted<br>mantle<br>um so thank you for thank you for having<br>me um<br>look um at top we<br>really believe that strong institutions<br>make uh<br>make a strong country and um<br>we think that you know democracy is a<br>fragile<br>a fragile thing and you know we look at<br>what happens<br>in the united states with with the<br>president we're not immune to any of<br>these things and<br>organizations like transparency<br>international um<br>help to underline the importance of<br>these strong institutions to protecting<br>our<br>democracy which protects our way of life<br>so i too would like to congratulate the<br>government on<br>following the advice of experts and<br>keeping us in a really good position<br>when it comes to covert but i would like<br>to ask them<br>why they ignore the evidence on just<br>about everything else<br>so they are very good and this does not<br>just apply to labour this applies to<br>you know every government that i've seen<br>for the last<br>30 years for example ignoring three tax<br>working groups ignoring the wealthy<br>expert advisory group<br>ignoring the water science technology<br>technical<br>group ignoring the uh advice on<br>uh reforming mmp of the electoral<br>commission<br>just to name a few so that is the thing<br>that makes<br>top different is that we we believe that<br>not just<br>covert is not the only crisis that kills<br>the housing crisis kills<br>poverty kills climate change kills and<br>we can use expertise<br>to save lives and make the make new<br>zealand a better place so that is what<br>top stands for and that is what i stand<br>for looking into the long term<br>uh looking to not just the<br>electoral term uh looking after people<br>who<br>can't vote protecting our institutions<br>following the evidence plus everything<br>we promise unlike<br>some parties up here um is is fully<br>costed because we think that it's<br>important then we that when politicians<br>make promises<br>they are able to deliver on them every<br>time a politician<br>fudges an answer makes a promise they<br>can't<br>can't keep takes<br>money that undermines at least the<br>appearance<br>of transparency in democracy this<br>weakens our<br>institutions and weakens our as uh<br>some of these gentlemen have pointed out<br>weakens our uh<br>awesome thank you and on to our final<br>candidate for the evening<br>uh welcome david patterson so david<br>patterson is the national party's<br>candidate for rongotai which is also<br>here in wellington<br>he is an alumni of victoria university<br>of wellington<br>completing a bachelor of law with<br>honours and a bachelor of commerce in<br>administration<br>david went on to complete his master's<br>in law at harvard university<br>david has been a partner in the law firm<br>chapman trip and one of new zealand's<br>leading commercial and tax lawyers for<br>the last 30 years<br>in addition to his legal career david is<br>the chair for the dingle foundation<br>wellington and wellington tennis as well<br>as former chair of fulbrigh new zealand<br>and tennis new zealand david kilda fiora<br>thank you and thank you all for the<br>great work you do in supporting<br>transparency international and the work<br>that they do<br>now i was told that i had a little<br>moment for a pitch and that as long as i<br>made some tangential reference to<br>transparency i'd be okay so i'm going to<br>be transparent about what i'm doing<br>and secondly i'm being transparent about<br>what we are now facing in this economy<br>with a negative 12.2 percent quarter<br>new zealand is in recession 170 000 more<br>people<br>will be unemployed than in march over<br>the course of the next year<br>that increases more than three times my<br>electorate and wronger tie<br>that's 170 000 families real people<br>real people who don't have jobs and real<br>families that don't have incomes<br>and we've got a lot worse than that in<br>the sense that a lot of people<br>also have quite that are not in that<br>hundred and seventy thousand also have<br>quite a significant reduction in their<br>hours of work<br>so national will produce more jobs by a<br>temporary three thousand dollar tax cut<br>for middle income earners it will bring<br>forward core infrastructure<br>it'll secure the border it'll encourage<br>private sector businesses to rebuild<br>and it's that private sector that's<br>going to create the new jobs that we<br>need as we dip into recession<br>and as we're starting to go down that<br>track and as we turn we need settings<br>that are ready in there that are going<br>to encourage those jobs to come back up<br>and it's the private sector that by and<br>large you're going to do that<br>and so national settings broadly are in<br>that space a ten thousand dollar grant<br>for businesses to take on each new<br>employee<br>thirty thousand in capital to start a<br>new business where a person has lost<br>their job<br>faster tax depreciation when you make<br>new planned investment<br>reskilling and retraining and new<br>apprenticeships repealing the rma more<br>flexible labor laws<br>and doubling in the nz tech sector by<br>2030.<br>for private businesses and for the jobs<br>that they create<br>this is a recipe for hope the type of<br>hope that bishop tutu refers<br>to when he says hope is being able to<br>see<br>light when all you all around you is<br>darkness thank you<br>awesome thank you candidates for um your<br>two and a half minute pitch and thank<br>you for sticking to time<br>so now we're going to go on to the part<br>of our evening where we're going to ask<br>some more detailed and technical<br>questions about those values that have<br>come up already<br>so i'm going to pass it along to my<br>colleague ian so<br>most of you here will know ian and his<br>work that he's done over the years<br>uh ian fraser was one of this country's<br>preeminent current affairs interviewers<br>and presenters for more than 20<br>years as chief executive and new zealand<br>commissioner general he was the driving<br>force behind new zealand's presence at<br>expo 88 in brisbane<br>and expo 92 in seville between 1998 and<br>2002 he was chief executive of the new<br>zealand symphony orchestra<br>and in april 2002 he moved from that<br>position to the role of chief executive<br>of television<br>new zealand a position he held until the<br>end of 2005.<br>since then he has been a personal<br>advisor and media coach to some of the<br>leading figures in new zealand's<br>business<br>the set may look a bit like<br>10 nights in a bar room<br>but this um this isn't that kind of<br>debate<br>uh it reminds me actually a lot of the<br>kind of debate<br>that we used to do back in the olden<br>days<br>when i chaired more than my fair share<br>of pre-election debates and everything<br>was rigidly worked<br>to the stopwatch and time was<br>assigned before the debate began<br>and if you didn't keep to the timing<br>and you got some bizarre situations for<br>example<br>the national party representative<br>would have four minutes<br>you didn't use your time um four minutes<br>give a pitch<br>on the basis of the fact that that<br>was the kind of time that was justified<br>on the basis of the pre-election public<br>opinion polls<br>labor would<br>almost invariably have the same amount<br>of time<br>and if you were poor bruce beatham<br>from the social credit party<br>i had time to ask a question but<br>he didn't have time to answer it<br>so so what we're doing here we're not<br>we're not debating and actually<br>given the history of debates<br>over the last couple of weeks<br>particularly the american inflected one<br>that's probably a relief<br>what i'm going to be doing is i'm<br>putting um<br>four substantial questions<br>one at a time to um each of the five<br>uh party representatives<br>and then with luck provided suzanne<br>leaves me alone<br>there'll be an opportunity to do<br>a little bit of follow-up we don't have<br>long for each of the answers<br>so if we don't cover the thing that<br>particularly interests you you get an<br>opportunity to follow up<br>in a rather more competent form than<br>i've managed at the end of the debate<br>there's ample time to do that so<br>and i'll try to make sure that we<br>mix up the order in which<br>they answer the questions as we go<br>through<br>we are in the middle of a pandemic and<br>no one needs to be<br>reminded of the extent to which the<br>world has changed<br>so starting with you andrew how do you<br>see covert 19<br>and our response to it impacting on<br>matters like<br>transparency and accountability<br>protective disclosure<br>i think by way of contrast and<br>in terms of dealing with covet 19 it was<br>an emergency situation<br>decisions had to be taken rapidly and<br>indeed the whole way parliament operated<br>had to change<br>but in doing that we also had to make<br>sure there were appropriate safeguards<br>and accountability measures which is why<br>we set up<br>the um the cover to response uh select<br>committee specialist<br>committee chaired by the then leader of<br>the opposition simon bridges<br>whether with a and in fact dominated by<br>uh members of the opposition<br>but in terms of the resp you know the<br>response since<br>i think the critical thing is that we<br>don't get used to that mode of operating<br>we don't get used to crisis mode<br>because that can be used as a as an<br>excuse or a defense for doing a lot of<br>things<br>i know that in the meantime we have<br>looked at the protected disclosures act<br>and we now have a uh an amending piece<br>of legislation<br>um not so much informed by what came out<br>of covert 19 but actually more out of<br>the<br>the minister of transport joe and<br>harrison<br>situation that arose a few years ago<br>ensuring that whistleblowers can have a<br>direct<br>place to go not inside the organization<br>but outside it<br>in terms of accountability making sure<br>that those institutions are in place<br>for proper and strong oversight of<br>public organizations<br>we've built up a good culture around<br>that there's still more that we can do<br>has the pandemic raised the corruption<br>threat level in new zealand do you think<br>whenever there is expedited decision<br>making there's always a risk that things<br>will fall through the cracks there's<br>been<br>significant sums of money appropriated<br>and budgeted<br>for the response we've left aside 14<br>billion dollars<br>for future responses such as the wage<br>subsidy<br>although at least one political party<br>has promised that that could be used to<br>fund tax cuts<br>we know that the way that the wage<br>subsidy was administered uh means some<br>people<br>took it some organizations took it who<br>probably didn't need it some of those<br>have paid it back<br>others are awaiting the audit no doubt<br>will be told to pay it back<br>there is always that risk but then you<br>have to trade off the need for<br>expedition and getting money into<br>organizations who need it to sustain<br>their workforce<br>as opposed to what is needed for kind of<br>the pure forms of<br>accountability james what do we need to<br>be doing to make sure that<br>hard and fast uh is also<br>transparent and accountable<br>i mean do you see do you see a uh<br>an increase in the threat level<br>to new zealand of various forms of<br>corruption<br>as a result of this pandemic<br>yes i do um i think uh<br>i look i i just i all i'm going to do<br>really is echo what andrew has just said<br>which is that<br>um when you're dealing with an<br>existential crisis<br>um you move very very quickly and we did<br>and um<br>quality decision making suffers as a<br>result of that of that speed<br>um and so i would i would actually say<br>rather than corruption there's<br>inefficiency<br>right so there was um you know there'd<br>be a lot of wastage at the margins that<br>you would hope not to have in a business<br>as usual scenario the three years in<br>government tells me that there's a<br>reasonable amount of waste<br>in a business as usual as well um and<br>and you just have to accept the fact<br>that there will be that<br>um i think the important thing is that<br>once you kind of through the crisis<br>stage<br>that you go back and review all of the<br>decisions that were made<br>during uh during that period of time i i<br>happened to<br>grant in his wisdom gave me the<br>delegation of<br>regulatory quality roughly a month<br>before we suspended<br>the need for our regulatory impact<br>statements um<br>so i didn't have much to do for a while<br>um but<br>what i would like to do is go back and<br>audit and apply regulatory impact<br>statements to all of the decisions that<br>were made during that period of time<br>when we weren't requiring them<br>and we simply were moving too fast to be<br>able to have those so anybody who's had<br>any time in the public service will know<br>the amount of time it takes to do this<br>now for ramping up the regulatory<br>framework<br>and the legislative framework in order<br>to<br>confront this new crisis<br>well no i i i do i just think um<br>i guess the important thing is to it's<br>just to be really straight about the<br>decisions that were made<br>you know and to go look it was a crisis<br>we did make all these decisions in a<br>hurry uh with<br>um frankly in most cases scant or no<br>real data<br>um and and you know there was a<br>reasonable level of kind of gut decision<br>making to deal with that crisis and i<br>think the vast majority of people my<br>experience go yeah we like we get it it<br>was a major crisis<br>the important thing is to kind of go<br>back and try and clean that up<br>afterwards<br>um and we will no doubt uh discover<br>decisions that were made erroneously or<br>um<br>you know i would just say erroneously uh<br>or maybe the decision wasn't erroneous<br>but there would be<br>flow on effects and and consequences<br>where<br>where there would be inefficiency and<br>wastage and i then think you just need<br>to kind of manage that<br>manage that back um and i and at one<br>level i think that that's fine i i do<br>think<br>that i actually the thing that worries<br>me more in terms of corruption is<br>what happens when you know you set up a<br>system and<br>and you then allow a particular way of<br>operating to sort of take hold<br>and given that we are basically flooding<br>liquidity into the economy to keep it<br>going<br>um it would be very easy to flip from a<br>very transparent and<br>and open economy to one which is much<br>more built around vested interests with<br>political influence<br>as you see in the united states um and<br>uh<br>and that really that really does worry<br>me<br>fletcher will come to you is is there<br>any evidence that<br>you've seen or that you're aware of that<br>the covert crisis<br>i'm an undersecretary so i'm part of the<br>executive but not<br>actually in cabinet and not part of the<br>decision-making process<br>so my only first-hand experience has<br>been<br>with the decision-making process around<br>the provincial growth fund for example<br>where that's decisions for ministers<br>plural<br>and then cabinet and then the strategic<br>tourism assets program which was a<br>very rapid deployment of<br>funds to help tourism operators to cope<br>with the uncertainty<br>and the loss of income even that was<br>a um a bringing together of<br>ministers rather than minister davis<br>making the decision by himself<br>and then excuse me and then they also<br>took external advice<br>from industry bodies and experts so<br>i actually agree with james in that<br>if i have any concerns it's not about<br>corruption<br>it's about a sensible use of funds given<br>the limited of knowledge<br>and the time constraints that we had and<br>can i just finish on the one point<br>i was on the pandemic the covert<br>response select committee<br>and my understanding is that was unique<br>in the rest of the world where the<br>government said<br>with consultation with the opposition<br>we need this form of accountability<br>uh in front of us and to give a new<br>select committee the chair to the<br>opposition leader<br>and them the right to call anyone<br>forward we actually<br>andrew might be able to explain that the<br>definitions better but essentially we<br>gave them slightly more power<br>than a standard select committee to make<br>sure that people turned up<br>and were accountable so it gave<br>a huge sense of accountability in terms<br>of new zealanders watching every day<br>and the feedback was that new zealanders<br>were incredibly pleased<br>that this had been the process<br>david um to you<br>there's always i think in the kind of<br>situation that we<br>have been in and that we're still facing<br>that um<br>we let the crisis become a kind of<br>veil for the corrupt<br>do you see any evidence that this has<br>i'm not sure about corrupt i mean i<br>probably start by saying look the<br>government to my view has done a<br>really good job of the lockdown i'm not<br>sure i'm allowed to say that but<br>i guess the question there what what<br>national would say remember i'm not in<br>the fray i'm a new<br>candidate so i'm watching it from the<br>trenches sidelines<br>as you may as the rest of us but what<br>you do see i think is<br>a lot lower levels of transparency right<br>through this<br>than what you would expect frankly and<br>maybe that's partly the emergency but it<br>is critical that it's not the norm<br>and i do think and i mean you can we can<br>go through examples of that i've got<br>some that i wrote down<br>you know medical advice is a regard<br>moving between levels<br>not particularly transparent as to what<br>it is but we've got our decision<br>the extent to which processes claim to<br>be in place are actually in place<br>not particularly transparent on some of<br>that so so how would your whole range of<br>those things how would you change<br>systems to cope with that well i think<br>if you<br>if you do dealing with that and you've<br>got parliament shut down and you're in<br>an emergency environment then that's a<br>separate thing<br>what we're talking about now going<br>forward is how does it look<br>and what we are talking about now is<br>monumental amounts of debt<br>the likes we've never seen and we're<br>talking about monumental<br>amounts of industry sector support the<br>likes we've never seen<br>and what i think and we're talking about<br>monumental amounts of investment and<br>infrastructure the likes of which we've<br>never seen<br>and so we do need to make sure<br>that when the private sector comes to<br>the public trough<br>we get real transparency out there on<br>all of that<br>that is absolutely critical because i've<br>worked for the private sector for 30<br>years of my life<br>i know that if you give them the<br>opportunity<br>to take advantage then by and large they<br>will take advantage<br>uh and that is why we need the level of<br>pr of uh<br>uh transparency at a heightened<br>awareness<br>right here and right now for these next<br>year or so<br>mighty jessica i'm happy for you to<br>answer the<br>general question first but just<br>to kind of point it from what david<br>was saying you know infrastructure<br>spending is shaping up as perhaps<br>the major driver of the economic<br>recovery and we are talking<br>vast sums of taxpayer dollars<br>are our processes for making<br>infrastructure decisions<br>open and transparent enough as things<br>stand i am so pleased you asked me that<br>question because this is one of the<br>biggest bug bears i have<br>um as a public servant i worked in<br>transport infrastructure<br>funding um as my as you know as<br>a policy advisor and um if i may<br>just digress very very briefly it's<br>super relevant and you know pre the uh<br>90s um you know the<br>process for funding infrastructure was<br>completely political<br>and you can uh you know buy votes<br>wherever you like or you know punish the<br>people you don't like buy votes from the<br>people you<br>do like and politicians made a very<br>responsible and very rare decision that<br>they were not<br>able to be trusted with that money so<br>they made those<br>infrastructure funding decisions<br>politically independent now<br>ever since then they have been eroding<br>it back when i was working at the<br>ministry of transport if someone said we<br>want this road or this<br>train station um the minister we would<br>we would write letters from the minister<br>saying the transport infrastructure<br>funding decisions are a<br>neutral um politically neutral<br>responsibility of the as was then<br>transfund<br>board and they like being able to say<br>that because then they can<br>you know stop doing the things they<br>don't want to do but they also want to<br>be able to buy the votes so they have<br>been eroding this over time national and<br>labor have both been eroding this<br>over time in in various ways so now with<br>the crown contributions and with the the<br>debt funding i don't<br>i wouldn't call it corruption but it's<br>opportunism<br>and the line between opportunism and<br>corruption can be very<br>fine sometimes so i think we need to<br>de-politicize infrastructure funding<br>they were right<br>politicians can't be trusted with our<br>children and grandchildren's money when<br>it comes to infrastructure<br>there's there's strong evidence that the<br>public sector has<br>become a great deal more focused on<br>preventing corruption over the past<br>i don't know five six seven years<br>the same can't necessarily be said<br>from the evidence that i've seen<br>for the private sector and<br>transparency's<br>assessment shows few of any signs of<br>improvement<br>in businesses complacency about its<br>conduct<br>and culture over the same period so<br>we're getting a two-step<br>kind of improvement now we've got<br>um an economic recovery<br>from covert to engineer so if anything<br>it gets more complex and it gets more<br>challenging<br>from here on in as we move into recovery<br>mode<br>what should we be doing to ensure that<br>business integrity<br>private sector integrity is strengthened<br>i took the question to be a bit about<br>i'm going to take it on a question of<br>um foreign corrupt corruption and<br>some of the illegalities we have in that<br>area<br>and the question is are they alert<br>and so i've taken the<br>course of talking to one of my friends<br>and one of the<br>top companies in new zealand major<br>exporter<br>who deals with this and what is very<br>clear to me from talking to him<br>he knows exactly that he's not able to<br>go out there and bribe<br>officials in a foreign country<br>absolutely exactly he knows that if he<br>does that<br>he's not only committing a crime he will<br>also lose his job<br>he does get training about it because<br>kiwis are a bit naive so i'll give you<br>an example of something<br>that happens you go out you turn up<br>you're playing<br>uh golf in a foreign country with a with<br>a<br>person who's an official of that country<br>and that you arrive at the t<br>and the official asks for a thousand<br>dollars<br>per hole on the golf match and the<br>intent<br>is not that you win any halls<br>so they do in fact go and get training<br>as to the top styles of corruption that<br>they're likely to face<br>in their daily jobs and that's this may<br>be an outlier<br>it may be an outlier but i do think that<br>there is quite a high degree of<br>awareness and i'd be surprised given<br>that<br>the criminal offences if for any country<br>that's dealing internationally there was<br>not a high level of focus on this at a<br>board governance level<br>your friend though is able presumably to<br>make<br>what we call facilitation payments<br>legally entitled should he be<br>well if he well i don't i didn't we<br>didn't get into the details of it<br>what he can't do if you're if what we're<br>saying because i don't think you can do<br>that for example under us<br>law i think that's a more that may be a<br>more<br>robust regime then then we are operating<br>in<br>uh and i don't i think the answer to<br>that is we shouldn't be doing anything<br>that actually embraces corruption okay<br>we've got we've got tens of billions of<br>dollars of public money<br>um being spent as i said on the pandemic<br>what should we be doing that we're not<br>doing right now<br>to make sure that with regard<br>to funding being funneled in the<br>direction of the<br>private sector that that money is<br>spent properly and with integrity<br>fletcher<br>to be honest um i have to say i'm not<br>too sure<br>um in parliament in our decision making<br>process<br>there's a huge huge system of<br>accountability<br>in terms of no one minister making a<br>decision<br>on procurement you take the infrastruct<br>infrastructure fund itself<br>um or even provincial growth fund<br>spending on roading for example<br>one of the greatest frustrations is on<br>the provincial ground<br>growth fund investment in roading is<br>that nzta did come back<br>and say uh yeah we'll do that but it's<br>on our list and we'll just<br>do it when um when<br>we get to it on our list and it was<br>incredibly um frustrating but that all<br>the ministers the red ministers<br>kind of you know sighed in frustration<br>and moved on to the next<br>uh challenge the infrastructure fund is<br>another example<br>of um the infrastructure minister the<br>state-owned minister uh the finance<br>minister<br>and others who have to be in the room<br>and actually if you look at the<br>frustration<br>of the corporate world at the moment is<br>that it's taken<br>so long to triage down and to justify<br>and to make those arguments in terms of<br>commercial investment<br>into infrastructure so that is my actual<br>impression and understanding<br>not that money's flying out the window<br>for example example the provincial<br>growth fund has only invested<br>about 1.2 billion of its total 3 billion<br>and that's about businesses meeting<br>milestones no one was<br>throwing money out the window at the<br>time or<br>you know the accusations that were being<br>thrown around regarding the provincial<br>growth fund<br>that was a very robust commercial<br>james i mentioned facilitation payments<br>which i believe are<br>what about the what about the<br>beneficial ownership of companies<br>is that something that that needs to be<br>more transparent<br>more open it is it is actually something<br>that we've moved on<br>uh in this last term um to<br>uh start to provide some transparency<br>and to look through companies and trusts<br>and so on and<br>and um one of the you know<br>at the time back in when was it 2015<br>2016 when the panama papers came out<br>uh you know we had something like trying<br>to remember 15<br>000 um uh trusts and companies uh<br>operating in<br>in new zealand and you know people<br>started saying oh well the vast majority<br>of these won't be used for corrupt<br>practices and<br>and so on but there'll be a tiny portion<br>that are um and so we said okay well<br>we'll change the law then and they said<br>well you don't need to do that because<br>most of them are being used for corrupt<br>practices in that case it won't matter<br>if we do<br>and so we did and then um two weeks<br>later there were eight<br>left um so uh so<br>it's clear that you know that you know<br>sunlight is the best<br>disinfectant then um i so i think but i<br>think that there's probably more work to<br>do there and<br>that would also help with our tax system<br>uh where uh you know you've<br>you see some avoidance still can i just<br>come back to this thing about um<br>politicians making decisions about<br>infrastructure spending i have some<br>recent<br>experience of this um and uh<br>you know it's funny there's there are<br>layers of irony um here because of<br>course i'm the only minister that got a<br>thoroughly good kicking<br>for uh an erroneous decision um made<br>under<br>uh pressure and speed um and at the time<br>i said i don't think that ministers<br>should be making these decisions<br>actually it should we actually should<br>have an infrastructure bank which i know<br>that the national party are promoting at<br>the moment<br>um of course we don't have time when<br>you're dealing with that sort of<br>need to inject that amount of liquidity<br>into the<br>economy in such a short period of time<br>to set one up<br>um but i have also set one up um in the<br>last term of<br>parliament in the green infrastructure<br>fund um<br>and so the green investment finance<br>limited<br>and that started with the principle that<br>just that politicians should not be<br>making those decisions and so we set it<br>up<br>at arm's length from ministers and i<br>have no prior knowledge of anything that<br>they're going to invest in<br>um until they about 24 hours in advance<br>they give us a notice and say well we've<br>you know we've made the following<br>investment decision and so on<br>and i actually think that should be the<br>model for like particularly now<br>because that was only 100 million<br>dollars green investment finance it was<br>a small<br>minimum viable proposition we were sort<br>of experimenting with something<br>but if you're about to spend the kind of<br>money that we're looking at spending<br>over the course the next term of<br>parliament<br>then i would say that you need an<br>institution that can do that<br>there are i also think an infrastructure<br>bank would be able to move<br>faster than the kind of contestable<br>funds<br>uh that the various public service<br>agencies um have<br>had and it is a frustration of ministers<br>that we've made some enormous<br>appropriations and then they've<br>basically sat in the bank<br>um because the agencies haven't been<br>able to<br>then deploy that but i think a a sort of<br>a<br>you know an arms length institution um<br>with you know staffed by real<br>professionals who are making decisions<br>on a benefit cost ratio basis<br>within very clear guidance that has been<br>set by ministers in terms of what those<br>criteria are<br>would both be able to um make uh<br>better decisions where there was less<br>concern about what it might do to voting<br>patterns<br>and um be able to uh deploy capital<br>faster than<br>uh we've been able to<br>thanks jessica just taking up um<br>james's point about the fact that we're<br>moving into recovery<br>and if anything uh things may end up<br>going harder and faster<br>um from this point so if you had to<br>identify the one<br>biggest thing from your perspective that<br>we<br>should be doing to ensure that<br>we're taking this opportunity to<br>strengthen<br>business integrity what would it be<br>to strengthen business integrity oh<br>i guess the only thing i could have any<br>real<br>insight into is is um is procurement so<br>government procurement<br>um of of business i i'm not gonna<br>um pretend to have the answers on<br>business integrity in general<br>but um you know<br>we've all talked about the sort of um<br>speed<br>transparency um<br>trade-off but and things move slowly in<br>the public service<br>for a reason you know shane jones was<br>very hard on public servants over the<br>provincial growth fund<br>but you know i have run funds in in the<br>public service and you can either do<br>things<br>transparently or you can do them quickly<br>you don't<br>you don't get to do both um but when it<br>comes to<br>procurement i don't know i take a pretty<br>hard<br>line on this i know um we want<br>procurement to solve<br>all of our problems so we want to you<br>know to be to be funding<br>indigenous businesses and women's<br>businesses and sustainable businesses<br>and and um or ones that are going to pay<br>on time and<br>you know there is there is a massive<br>list but actually<br>when you are taking massive amounts of<br>money from government<br>then you need to be able to report on it<br>and if you<br>if you're not going to then you<br>shouldn't be taking the money<br>the other thing we we should be doing<br>which we don't do enough of<br>i mean i i james i i like the<br>intention of going back and doing<br>regulatory impact statements<br>but we don't evaluate in the public<br>service<br>it just it just almost never happens so<br>so we're constantly there's this<br>pressure<br>and i think the three-year parliamentary<br>term sorry i'm going a bit all over the<br>place but<br>the three-year parliamentary term is<br>part of this there's this pressure to<br>constantly go<br>quickly and to make decisions with<br>inadequate evidence and then we don't go<br>back afterwards and see with the thing<br>we were funding<br>worked ian<br>i know you're about to ask a question of<br>andrew and he hasn't had a lot of<br>airtime but<br>can i jump in on this question about<br>private sector<br>transparency i think what we'll do<br>is we'll leave that if we may until the<br>end<br>i'm really anxious that um everybody<br>gathered here<br>has an opportunity to trawl you guys<br>andrew<br>we know that national has<br>promised into a considerable amount of<br>public applause<br>to double the serious fraud officer's<br>budget<br>to 25 million a year how important i<br>mean this is looking at the<br>sort of deterrence stroke coercion<br>side of the thing how important would<br>that be<br>in reinforcing integrity<br>and um dealing to corruption<br>i'm going to try and weave together<br>three things first and answer to their<br>question then<br>an answer to some of the other questions<br>but on that actually i i don't disagree<br>with<br>uh what the national party is proposing<br>to do<br>i think the more important part of the<br>proposal is to extend the remit of the<br>syria's fraud office<br>and and actually not to call it a<br>serious fraud office but to give it a<br>broader anti-corruption mandate<br>and it's something i personally believed<br>in um and indeed stuart nation i have<br>started some work on that<br>um and i think that is an area that we<br>need to go the extent to which it<br>it affects the budget i mean let's you<br>know let's see what happens there<br>um i think that is important because i<br>think and when it comes to<br>the private sector and business i think<br>one of the big<br>challenges we have is for those<br>interacting with private businesses<br>is is just the means or the ability<br>to challenge uh decisions<br>uh or the impact of decisions on people<br>who<br>who don't have the means to do so<br>there's an access to justice issue here<br>so um shareholders or customers who are<br>ripped off by business<br>unless they are well backed and whether<br>they've got litigation funders or others<br>i find it very difficult to get<br>accountability at least<br>through the legal system i want to<br>comment on just something else<br>slightly tangentially but the the<br>interplay between<br>politics and uh so-called rational<br>decision-making about infrastructure the<br>reality is<br>it is totally legitimate for politicians<br>and political parties<br>to say we think this is an answer to an<br>infrastructure problem and it is to do<br>this<br>it is to build seven roads of national<br>significant significance it is to build<br>a city rail<br>link it is to build uh light rail down<br>dominion road and out to the airport<br>that is a totally legitimate thing for<br>the political process<br>to put up and to get a response from the<br>electorate on and if the electorate says<br>yes<br>to proceed with that i don't accept that<br>politicians should be driven to be<br>technocrats when it comes to these sorts<br>of things<br>i think the bigger problem is what we're<br>seeing in for example in transmission<br>galley<br>where a construction contractor signed<br>up to we're actually<br>the owner of the contract in this case<br>the government loses total control of<br>the price of it<br>because of the nature of the contracting<br>the ability to ramp up cost<br>for unplanned and unforeseen aspects of<br>it<br>it could be corrupt but it is certainly<br>i<br>i think an unaccountable form of<br>contract<br>shall we<br>it makes a nice transition as we move on<br>and the next question is about the media<br>so<br>i guess i should really don sack cloth<br>and dashes<br>to ask it but i'm scared they get in my<br>mouth<br>we know that the media were already<br>facing<br>a systemic crisis before covert<br>their financial model based on selling<br>advertising<br>uh has been pillaged<br>by social media so the clouds<br>were already gathering then<br>covert comes along and the crisis<br>becomes existential<br>um the listener disappears although it's<br>back<br>now thank god um it looked for a while<br>as though the<br>stuff stable might follow it nz<br>me has balance sheet issues<br>you're just in time two two related<br>questions<br>on the media how important is freedom of<br>the press<br>um in strengthening public transparency<br>and accountability number one<br>number two what needs to be done<br>to strengthen the media's own<br>integrity systems so they can be<br>effective<br>in preventing corruption<br>and perhaps also in keeping them on the<br>obviously new zealand first is<br>as frustrated as the right honourable<br>winston peters gets with the media<br>and it happens every day we<br>are strong advocates of the fourth<br>estate and their role<br>in our democratic process they they must<br>be there and and we cannot let that<br>lapse and in fact unfortunately this<br>government<br>had to uh invest was at 50 50 million<br>dollars<br>in the media bailout package uh earlier<br>this year<br>and and that was about ensuring that<br>that<br>stable of uh media outlets uh could<br>continue<br>um there's some probably some fair<br>arguments around<br>their own uh principles and in ethics<br>i would i would debate with some of them<br>on those<br>issues but it doesn't for example you<br>talk to a reporter<br>just like they talk to a politician<br>there's usually a mutual respect it<br>seems to change as you go into the<br>editor's office or something like that<br>and that might be<br>about uh competition and and<br>who is shaping the message who<br>who has that privilege and there's not a<br>lot of competition<br>in new zealand anymore and that's<br>something that we need to be<br>mindful of as we proceed forward<br>in terms of making sure that we have<br>a sound fourth estate to hold us<br>accountable<br>but you're right in terms of the<br>phrasing of your last question<br>is there or what can we do<br>as a public as as a um as a country<br>to ensure that um the media themselves<br>so i mean in order to<br>get or sustain that sort of competition<br>um would you go as far<br>as to i'll finish the question let you<br>answer it briefly right it's<br>it's beginning to sound like the chase<br>um<br>would you would you go so far as to<br>direct<br>public funding towards commercial<br>organizations<br>we kind of do it that's been on the<br>agenda we kind of do it with rnz right<br>one of the big<br>budget items of the last budget was<br>increasing funding to rnz<br>we were government when that decision<br>was made and they certainly haven't been<br>uh particularly friendly to us<br>but they're publicly owned that's true<br>but perhaps<br>the step i would make and this is a<br>personal opinion<br>is more about the accountability of<br>social media<br>in our modern discourse<br>because not only are they sapping<br>revenue from these kind of traditional<br>outlets<br>but it doesn't seem to be the level of<br>accountability<br>that we i believe in this room we would<br>all would want<br>and in terms of um what we're seeing<br>in these social media platforms<br>i think that's an opportunity james what<br>would<br>you be doing to strengthen the media's<br>own integrity<br>systems such as they are so<br>they can be more effective in the<br>business of<br>attacking and exposing<br>corruption well i i do think that<br>funding and financing is<br>critical to the health of the system and<br>it's clearly taken an absolute hammering<br>um over the re over the last decade um<br>and and that is accelerating<br>uh at the moment um and so i do think<br>that<br>um public financing of uh<br>shall i say non-public media entities<br>is probably the only sustainable<br>way forward in a economy as small as new<br>zealand's<br>in an ideal world i think you would have<br>a colossal<br>um endowment fund um where<br>because the risk of course of public<br>funding is that<br>um either economic circumstances or<br>a hostile government comes in and cuts<br>the funding<br>um and and so it still becomes beholden<br>to<br>the political pay masters so i think if<br>you were able to you would have a<br>an entirely separate uh fund that had<br>nothing to do with government that was<br>large enough to be able to make um<br>allocation decisions<br>i do um i don't i i get uncomfortable<br>with the idea that we should be using<br>public money to fund<br>for-profit entities but if you look at<br>the recent developments with stuff<br>for example where sinead baucher bought<br>stuff for a dollar<br>uh from um um fairfax<br>uh then you've got essentially a um<br>you know a worker cooperative model you<br>know where<br>you which is a non-profit entity<br>where you could say actually there is a<br>case there for um<br>funding that i mean that's a that's not<br>like rnz or tavians it's not owned by<br>the government it's an<br>it is a separate entity but it doesn't<br>have that profit motive uh<br>at play um and and so there's that and<br>then<br>and then the other thing is actually is<br>just things like the um pressed<br>complaints um process and so on again<br>that's a pretty anemically<br>resourced um thing and and i think those<br>kinds of processes<br>where you can take a complaint and have<br>it heard<br>is a good way of keeping accountability<br>in in the system as well<br>um but like fletcher we have to do<br>something about social media<br>because regardless of funding and<br>just your general take on the importance<br>of<br>the freedom of media and whether<br>their own integrity systems are<br>strong enough to be able to kind of<br>sustain the battle against<br>corruption which has always been part of<br>the media's business<br>yeah there's no question um a strong<br>robust media is absolutely vital for a<br>thriving<br>uh liberal democracy such as we've got<br>and i actually think<br>too we all have good days and bad days<br>and so does the media<br>but we are pretty well served by our<br>media in new zealand both um<br>uh privately owned and public media and<br>we should be very thankful for that<br>um but i think because of<br>uh threats around funding and finance uh<br>some of that is at risk some ethical<br>standards are at risk<br>uh to the extent that we regard the role<br>of the media<br>in informing people and holding<br>those in power to account both public<br>and private<br>and there was a public interest in that<br>then i think there is a case for<br>public funding to media organizations we<br>do it the state-owned organizations<br>radio new zealand<br>to some extent tvnz we do it with<br>private organizations like media works<br>through new zealand on air<br>but and we do it for entertainment<br>purposes and some documentaries but<br>actually for our<br>day-to-day current affairs i don't have<br>a problem with there being some<br>state support for that to ensure<br>integrity of reporting<br>uh good uh journalistic<br>ethical standards being maintained um is<br>going to be vital you know<br>the counter to the abuse of power is<br>there are those who<br>are able to call it out and not be<br>themselves compromised for doing so<br>that's why an independent media<br>is vital i just want to say too if you<br>have a look at the respective<br>performances of the<br>publicly owned media and the privately<br>owned media actually our private media<br>does a pretty darn good job<br>you look at the work for example that<br>michael mora did on the border control<br>issues we had during the pandemic<br>he didn't win a lot of popular press<br>from a lot of people kind of on my side<br>of politics but he did a darn good job<br>you have a look at the first two leaders<br>debates tvnz and media works<br>i know which one i prefer to watch uh<br>that i found much more informative<br>and and i think you know well moderated<br>and it wasn't tv instead<br>david do you share um<br>andrew's sense that in order to<br>deal to what is a kind of existential<br>threat<br>that commercial media are facing at the<br>moment<br>that there is a justification for<br>trying to sustain them better with<br>public<br>public funding<br>well i think the key we found out a lot<br>more about the covert response and some<br>of the<br>deficiencies and some of the things that<br>were actually going on because of what<br>the media were doing<br>so i think that's a key part of the<br>accountability system the one that i<br>worry about most is the<br>old style journalists that i've known<br>for a long time<br>who've come up under a completely<br>different system that was economic<br>and you had real quality in there and<br>and<br>a lot of those are still hanging on but<br>they're not there for that much longer<br>and you're not you're not getting the<br>training ground for<br>their replacements so my suggestion for<br>what it's worth this is certainly not<br>national party policy<br>would be let's get some of the money off<br>the social media guys<br>which we a number of countries in the<br>world are into<br>we are expanding our tax net if they're<br>going to take advertising money from<br>here then let's get some of that money<br>we do fund films that are not for profit<br>i can't see why we shouldn't have an<br>agency like a film commission style<br>thing that funds investigative<br>journalism i certainly wouldn't want it<br>funded from central government<br>where the money's being controlled by<br>the people that it's designed to be<br>policed<br>thanks for that um jessica<br>do we need to do more um to make it<br>easier<br>to encourage the media<br>more to discharge their task of<br>holding power to account yes absolutely<br>and<br>i'm probably gonna have to go after this<br>question i'm very sorry but i haven't<br>uh meet the candidates at 7 30. but um<br>on that absolutely so so um top's policy<br>is<br>that we should be as david said we<br>should be taxing the likes of google on<br>facebook and that should be used for a<br>public interest<br>journalism fund a contestable fund that<br>public or or<br>um that rnz or private companies can<br>um can apply to but i think i would go<br>further than that because one of the<br>things that motivates<br>the media to hold parliament<br>to hold politicians to account is an<br>informed um sort of an independently<br>informed public so i feel like civics<br>education is<br>a massive part of the story<br>i've taken it upon myself to make a<br>whole bunch of sort of videos and things<br>about how<br>um how mmp works because it's always<br>shocking how many people<br>um i meet who don't know there's an<br>election don't understand that it's for<br>central government<br>don't know the difference between what<br>central and local government does don't<br>know what their two votes do<br>don't know whether you know which vote<br>is more important for what<br>reasons and because the um<br>the media you know relies on on readers<br>and and and clicks and they don't always<br>like pop the public service they've got<br>the speed this the sort of the speed<br>transparency<br>process trade-off as well if they are<br>reporting to an informed<br>public um they are going to have i think<br>a stronger ability and incentive to<br>report on really important things that<br>are happening<br>we don't have time for applause<br>final question and because we're running<br>short of time and<br>as i said earlier it's important that<br>these guys have their opportunity as<br>well i'm<br>almost going to ask you not only to give<br>a very brief<br>answer but almost a yes or no<br>and since it's about political party<br>funding i don't think you'll have<br>what we know is that three political<br>parties had<br>or have cases in front of the serious<br>fraud office<br>around what may be illegal party<br>donations<br>all three of those parties are<br>represented here tonight<br>and i should make it clear that none of<br>the legal processes underway are<br>concluded yet<br>so it's much too early to be pointing<br>fingers<br>but the optics of having three of our<br>major parties<br>implicated in this sort of stuff<br>are awful bearing in mind that parties<br>aren't viable without funding from<br>somewhere<br>do we need to change<br>the way we fund political parties<br>and do we need to change<br>the political funding rules<br>and we'll let them follow it up so don't<br>i don't need a<br>peace early stage<br>yeah yeah yeah sure yep yep that's okay<br>yes so<br>um at top we support a royal commission<br>into<br>funding of um political parties i should<br>note that in 2019<br>top had more donations than all the<br>parties in parliament put together and<br>the average donation was 25<br>so you can fund a political party on<br>micro donations but we would support a<br>royal commission and we really<br>would like it to look at vehicles like<br>democracy dollars for instance<br>the answer to that is probably no can to<br>their yes<br>but maybe i can explain a little<br>uh i think you've got to get the<br>transparency rules to work<br>because we do want transparency about<br>who's donating what<br>and if you're not if they're not and one<br>question will be are people<br>understanding them uh<br>because we've got these cases so what<br>went wrong are these examples of the<br>system working<br>because they got found out or are they<br>examples of the system not working<br>so i'm not sure about the answer to that<br>and probably not the place we should go<br>we do if we do not want foreign<br>donations my view<br>uh certainly from foreign governments<br>question about if we've got an<br>australian<br>parent of a new zealand sub should a new<br>zealand sub be able to contribute well<br>possibly<br>and our party is built on engagement<br>with members<br>uh and that is a key cornerstone of of<br>the<br>building of it and they give things to<br>the party by way of time<br>and on occasion money as well thank you<br>fletcher<br>yeah i wouldn't want to see taxpayers<br>funding parties political campaigns<br>um and and<br>there's kind of two reasons for that<br>it's kind of well you don't want to lock<br>in<br>those political parties who are already<br>kind of popular in power you want to<br>encourage participation from outside<br>you know the mainstream so to do that<br>you have to<br>get donations there's been a lot of<br>politicians say the system's kind of<br>right it's just that accountability that<br>transparency<br>and holding political parties to account<br>and there are three parties here are<br>being held to account so<br>let's go through that system and learn<br>from mistakes<br>andrew yeah i think i mean if if we're<br>not going to<br>get contributions from voters or for<br>that matter you know corporate interests<br>then it's<br>got to come from somewhere else and the<br>other other place that the<br>public discourse really points to is<br>states so state funding of political<br>parties<br>other countries have it we don't have a<br>tradition of that we've relied on<br>um on private uh voluntary donations<br>um jessica's not quite right when she<br>says that top was funded by a whole<br>bunch of small donations because of<br>course they had gareth morgan<br>who provided not a small amount of seed<br>funding let's face it<br>uh and we've had a number of political<br>parties that have had huge benefit or<br>benefactors with huge resources to set<br>political parties up<br>ironically seldom ever getting elected<br>and we've had to<br>you know various incarnations of<br>christian parties and what have you but<br>but this is the debate we could have if<br>we're going to<br>flip it from and and want to mitigate<br>the risk<br>of people donating particularly<br>significant<br>donations for improper motives then<br>state funding is the alternative would<br>have to have a reasonably extended<br>public debate about that<br>thank you very much<br>yeah 100 so yes questions and we've got<br>some microphone runners who will bring<br>the<br>microphone to you and then we'll be able<br>felicity wong from historic places<br>wellington um<br>you mentioned social media and<br>um the question is not so much about<br>financial<br>integrity but more about integrity of<br>the political discourse or the debate<br>about various policies so i would ask<br>minister little for his views on this in<br>light of<br>the campaign being run by neil jones<br>from your office some time ago to be<br>involved in<br>the consultation by the wellington city<br>council on the<br>draft spatial plan he's been running a<br>campaign on twitter<br>and heritage people like myself have<br>been accused on twitter of being in<br>favor of<br>homelessness by neil<br>and spin-off writers um and<br>what what is your advice to us about<br>having<br>a good discourse about something that's<br>really important for our city<br>pr companies involved on twitter<br>thank you i'm not quite sure what<br>neil jones's personal interest or stake<br>and it is and i'm not<br>i'm not familiar with him leading or<br>running a campaign i've seen a number of<br>comments from a number of people on<br>twitter about<br>about that it tells you there is a set<br>of political differences over there<br>there are some people who are in favor<br>of high high density housing<br>some people will say that is the future<br>direction of metropolitan areas like<br>wellington<br>there are those who say we want to<br>preserve the way things<br>look now uh because they are historical<br>and<br>have some value that is a legitimate<br>political debate to have<br>i don't think there's any scope for<br>anybody to take offense about there<br>being a difference of view about that<br>we have a major challenge about housing<br>how we're going to accommodate people<br>and and that is a part of it<br>it doesn't surprise me that there will<br>be some sort of campaign they typically<br>are when<br>important public decisions are made in<br>this case by city council<br>the planning decision because it will<br>affect a lot of lives<br>both now and in the future and which<br>will welcome and cherish<br>the public debate cool thank you<br>and take a question from the other side<br>now but<br>no one over there has any questions um<br>hand up over here<br>was here yep<br>thank you yes liz holbrow um i've been<br>worried for some time about the future<br>of<br>investigative journalism as i know<br>several of you have<br>and i was quite surprised when both<br>stuff<br>and spinoff invited voluntary<br>contributions because i thought that<br>really can't get them very far can it<br>but believing in the cause i made fairly<br>small modest donations to both of those<br>and i've since had feedback from both of<br>them saying that it really did make a<br>difference that they were able not just<br>to retain<br>staff who had been doing investigative<br>journalism but in both cases they'd<br>appointed extra people whom they named<br>stuff went even further by inviting a<br>selection of the people who'd made<br>donations of that sort to a function<br>where they had presentations from their<br>leading journalists<br>uh with sinead voucher there as well who<br>even confessed that the dollar was a bit<br>misleading that actually been a lot of<br>assets negotiation involved but still<br>she'd done it very cleverly and i think<br>what andrew said about the basis of it<br>was totally correct<br>and if you didn't believe it you had the<br>opportunity to question<br>it and there was a very uh lively<br>exchange between<br>journalists and those present which was<br>then followed by the sort of interaction<br>we'll have in a few minutes<br>so i just wonder how whether<br>that's sustainable and whether that can<br>be a part of the future<br>i wouldn't like to think that it would<br>stop government considering whether they<br>dubbed in as well and it might even help<br>the government to dive in<br>if that movement becomes more pronounced<br>so i just like to commend it to people<br>here tonight who are interested in<br>biscuit of journalism<br>and watch what the companies say because<br>what they're saying at the moment is<br>that it's important to us<br>it's made a difference and it's given us<br>a source of feedback about what we're<br>doing<br>and i really think that's very healthy<br>because some of us are a bit concerned<br>at the way journalists behave at times<br>and if you have a chance to have them on<br>about it then<br>uh who knows uh that can make a change<br>as well<br>can we get a comment from all of the<br>um<br>the people up here on the on the<br>podium just because<br>this is a model that exists in other<br>places<br>i mean public radio and television in<br>to a very considerable extent funded by<br>um subscription or by local ballot or by<br>telethon<br>is there any reason why we shouldn't<br>kind of widen the<br>stream of funding and go after this<br>man yeah yeah sure yeah uh<br>so stuff at least i think have taken a<br>leaf out of the guardians book<br>and because the guardian went down that<br>route of asking for voluntary con<br>contributions of course the guardian is<br>supplementing an enormous<br>fund that they happen to have which<br>enables them to be able to do what<br>they're doing<br>um and they take advertising as well so<br>they're looking at you know<br>they're basically pulling every lever<br>that they're able to uh able to pull<br>um i think so so do i think it's<br>sustainable i don't think it's<br>sustainable by itself<br>uh and um and but as<br>but as a way of receiving revenue i<br>don't<br>you know i don't have anything against<br>it um but i think i don't think that we<br>should rely on that as the future of<br>journalism<br>and i think probably our media<br>industry made an era of judgment some<br>time ago<br>and the window of opportunity is now<br>closed for everyone to adopt<br>a subscription model however<br>in a country of five million people a<br>subscription model isn't going to be<br>enough the new york times has been very<br>successful with its subscription model<br>but they have 40 million readers<br>we only have five million people most of<br>whom don't<br>punt for newspapers so um so you've got<br>to look at something else<br>uh which is why i was talking before<br>about the idea of<br>saying that we've got to underpin it<br>with some form of public funding<br>that somehow doesn't have anything to do<br>with politicians<br>david i like it as a great model i mean<br>the other thing isn't it how much more<br>engaged do you feel<br>to stuff having gone along had the<br>discussions felt that what you'd done<br>was valued<br>and i had an engagement with them other<br>than purely reading the paper<br>i think i pay my 800 for the digital<br>version and then i find out that if i<br>was<br>more tech savvy i could find a way to<br>get it for free so i feel like<br>i'm already implementing your practice<br>thank you fletcher i'm going to say<br>something controversial here tonight and<br>say i completely agree with james<br>stewart<br>mark that down we do have a record<br>there's reporters in the room um yeah i<br>think like as others have said other<br>other news outlets have followed that<br>model<br>guardian as the other one too but like<br>the new york times they have a worldwide<br>subscriber base not five million people<br>the other thing is too we do have news<br>outlets<br>who do have uh significant benefactors<br>who have<br>allowed them to establish newsroom is<br>one of them they do good quality<br>journalism<br>they're not they're not entirely reliant<br>on subscribers they do get<br>contributions in subscriptions but they<br>have significant benefit to sitting<br>behind them as well<br>um and that's only one step removed from<br>you know for example<br>uh you know corporate sponsorship and<br>there's always going to be that 10<br>not that corporate sponsorship and media<br>have ever been uh<br>allergic to each other it's been<br>critical to it but<br>uh when it comes to transparency and<br>integrity and openness<br>in the media we need to know where the<br>significant sources of funding are<br>coming from<br>as well particularly given that it's no<br>longer just advertisers anymore<br>thank goodness that this isn't a zoom<br>conference<br>and we have actually been able to go<br>over time but i'm sorry we're going to<br>have to<br>leave it now because we've taken<br>everyone's time beyond what they'd<br>originally committed to<br>but can i please thank our speakers<br>tonight<br>our four political candidates tametha<br>and ian<br>can you join me in thanking them<br>and i want to thank all of you for<br>coming and for your excellent questions<br>um it's really appreciated and i don't<br>know how you felt but it was<br>not only was it a pleasure to be here in<br>person and not to be on zoom<br>but what is was it a pleasure to hear<br>people answer questions<br>honestly and without posturing tonight<br>um<br>i think we got some real genuine answers<br>this is a special place that we live in<br>and<br>um you know through deliberate steps<br>that we take now based on what we've<br>done with covert<br>where we've shown how we can work as a<br>trusted democracy<br>we have real opportunities i think for a<br>business recovery that's going to make a<br>difference<br>that's actually going to bring us up<br>higher than we've been in the past<br>and you see tonight that we've got<br>evidence that the solid foundations of<br>transparency and accountability<br>are with us we've got some great people<br>running for parliament and let's look<br>to what they do when they get there<br>thank you all please stay after go<br>upstairs and have some refrigerants<br>thank you very much karen and blake and<br>georgia and alexandra for<br>actually working on this and karen for<br>co-hosting<br>with transparency international we'd<br>like you all to become members of<br>transparency international<br>or at least join our database these<br>discussions are so important to our<br>future<br>thank you very much see you upstairs for<br>refrigerators</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
