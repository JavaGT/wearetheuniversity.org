accurate.</p><p>so<br>kia ora today for future designers we're<br>going to look at how to make a switch<br>so to start off with we're going to talk<br>about a really basic circuit<br>so for a basic circuit you need to have<br>a battery and because we're looking at<br>lights<br>you need to have a light and for it to<br>work you need to have electricity<br>flowing through that so<br>i've got my battery here so i'm going to<br>place that and then i have my red wire<br>representing my positive<br>and my black wire representing my<br>negative and then i have a little led<br>light<br>so to make this circuit uh work and turn<br>the light on<br>i just have to connect it up so that the<br>lights attach like that and it turns on<br>now with an led that's a light emitting<br>diode<br>and a diode only lets electricity flow<br>through one direction<br>so if i were to undo this and<br>then you'll see it won't turn on so you<br>do need to make sure you've got your<br>correct positive and negative<br>the other thing you need to make sure is<br>that your light and your power source<br>are matched now the easiest way to do<br>this is just to get a cheap light from<br>the two dollar shop<br>that will mean that your power source<br>and your light are already matched and<br>it's also a great way to get those<br>electronics really cheaply you don't<br>need to go to any type of electronics<br>store<br>or um mess with names at all so we're<br>saying<br>make sure that the lights that you're<br>using if you're making a switch you're<br>doing it with a battery pack<br>so please do not start messing with any<br>other power supplies<br>okay so you can get lights from the two<br>dollar shop and that's a really good way<br>to get the cheap electronics<br>the cheaper the plastic is the easier it<br>is to take it apart so this has some<br>really bright leds<br>um it's got a few different it's got a<br>switch and a few different<br>uh settings and you can just undo that<br>with a screw<br>even a little torch you can also unscrew<br>and take apart<br>you've got the battery so you've got a<br>nice battery pack there<br>and then you've got the little uh<br>circuit board that has the leds in it<br>which you can take out<br>by just putting a bit of pressure on it<br>it's a good really<br>good way to get your electronics and to<br>make sure that your battery and your<br>light are well matched<br>okay<br>there we go i have made a light i have<br>my power and i have my light source<br>now the one thing that might be missing<br>is the switch how do you turn it on and<br>off<br>now switch is just breaking and<br>reconnecting that circuit<br>so most people will think about a switch<br>as a button they might push or a little<br>lever they slide but all it really is<br>underneath is a break and a reconnect<br>okay so once you've cut your circuit<br>it's really easy to just then reconnect<br>it<br>and disconnect it and that's really all<br>the switches so we think about buttons<br>or levers or switches that we change and<br>turn on and off<br>but all that's doing is disconnecting<br>and reconnecting the circular circuit so<br>it's a really nice simple<br>interaction and from a design point of<br>view we can think about different ways<br>in which<br>you can reconnect those so what i did is<br>i went to the<br>two dollar shop and i got one of these<br>gloves which is a glove that allows you<br>to use your touch phone<br>when you're still still have your gloves<br>on which is<br>important if you're gardening sometimes<br>you might be listening to music you want<br>to change the jack<br>and then what i can do is just connect<br>this wire<br>into that conductive part now the thing<br>about electricity is it needs to<br>have a conductive material to run<br>through so<br>as long as you've got something that can<br>conduct the electricity you can make a<br>circuit with this<br>and we've got great materials now like<br>conductive fabrics that allow us to make<br>some pretty neat<br>switches or interactions or products<br>from them<br>i'm just putting that wire through those<br>parts of the glove<br>now i've put my glove on<br>i've got my light here and then when i<br>push my fingers together it lights up<br>and so that's just a really nice simple<br>interaction using really cheap<br>foundation like materials from the<br>two-dollar shop<br>but now i've got this really nice i'm<br>gonna turn it on<br>and off just very simply<br>there are all sorts of ways of thinking<br>about making switches in design<br>and a good way to start your interaction<br>or get some inspiration<br>is to think about when we want to turn<br>the light on and off<br>so when do you turn your light on do you<br>turn your light on when you get home<br>from school when you're doing a<br>particular task maybe a task light where<br>you need to see really carefully maybe<br>you're doing<br>some drawing um it might be when you<br>open your front door and you look out<br>and you want your<br>front light to turn on so you can<br>actually see who's outside<br>or see your way to the recycling bin and<br>or you can think about when you go to<br>bed and you turn off your light but you<br>still have to walk to your bed and you<br>don't want to trip<br>over when you're when you're getting<br>this you might want a light to turn on<br>the wrong thing<br>so if you're thinking about designing<br>when you're going to bed and you want to<br>turn off the light but you don't want to<br>trim over anything on the way<br>you could have something like this where<br>you pull back your<br>duvet the lights turn on and then you go<br>off<br>and then you can get back to bed without<br>tripping over anything<br>so what's really nice about this is it's<br>just a normal<br>seed leds that you can get from doodle<br>shop or online<br>and what i've done is i've connected<br>some copper wire that i've just sewn<br>into the blanket you can also get<br>conductive thread which is pretty cool<br>but i just used wire<br>and i put some wire here and somewhere<br>over here and i just followed the<br>pattern and the duvet<br>and then they just work as a switch just<br>like we described earlier<br>so when i connect the circuit those<br>lights turn on<br>it's just very simple very easy to make<br>so i have a little battery pack up here<br>and then i have one part of the circuit<br>going across<br>and down to the side and another part<br>coming down into this point here<br>so that they connect and turn on and<br>then when you want to go back to sleep<br>you don't want the lights on anymore you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
