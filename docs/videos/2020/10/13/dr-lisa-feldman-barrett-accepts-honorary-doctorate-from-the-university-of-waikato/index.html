She shows that our emotions are not built into our brains from birth, to be triggered outside forces, but events that our brains construct, shaped by our experiences, our language, and our culture.<br><br>As a University Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University, with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr Barrett’s work in cognitive, social and affective neuroscience has significant implications for both everyday and high-stakes interactions.<br><br>Her book How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain, brought Dr Barrett’s work to a general audience, while five other scholarly books and more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers reflect the impact of her research on a range of fields.<br><br>An honorary doctorate is the University’s most prestigious honour and University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says it is in recognition of Dr Barrett’s substantial and ongoing contribution to the field of psychology, and pioneering approach to human emotion.<br><br>“It has been a privilege to welcome Dr Barrett to New Zealand as part of the New Zealand Writers Festival, and it is an opportunity for us to recognise her contribution to her field,” says Professor Quigley.<br><br>Dr Barrett is honoured to receive this prestigious award, and hopes it is the beginning of a strong association between herself and the University.<br><br>“It is with deep gratitude and much affection that I accept this award. It is a great privilege to work as a scientist, discovering how human minds are created from human brains and bodies. It is an even greater privilege to have the opportunity to shape those minds as an educator. I’m delighted to join your scholarly community.”<br><br>Dr Barrett is the current President of Association for Psychological Science, a global organisation of more than 30,000 members. She is also an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society of Canada.<br><br>Dr Barrett spoke in a public event at the University as part of the New Zealand Writers Festival.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening everyone my name is neil<br>quigley i'm the vice chancellor of the<br>university<br>it's my pleasure to welcome all of you<br>to this<br>event this evening<br>this evening we have the opportunity to<br>recognize the<br>outstanding scientific achievements and<br>contributions of dr lisa feldman barrett<br>dr barrett is in new zealand to speak at<br>the writers festival<br>in wellington as the principal sponsor<br>of the writers festival<br>the university of waikato negotiated the<br>right to bring a selection of<br>the festival authors to hamilton<br>dr barrett's visit is the first of these<br>events<br>tonight the event is in three parts<br>first the chancellor the right<br>honourable sir anna and sachin and<br>will confer an honorary doctorate on dr<br>barrett<br>following the presentation of this award<br>dr barrett will give her lecture<br>and at the conclusion of the lecture<br>there'll be an opportunity<br>for dr barrett to answer your questions<br>coordinated by<br>professor marianne gary from the<br>university of waikato school of<br>psychology<br>as is customary when the university<br>awards an honorary doctorate i'd like to<br>begin<br>by reading the citation<br>the university of waikato is pleased to<br>bestow an honorary doctorate<br>on dr lisa feldman barrett for her<br>contribution to psychology<br>dr barrett is one of the world's most<br>respected scientists<br>in the field of human emotion her<br>research has radically challenged the<br>prevailing wisdom<br>about how the human brain and body work<br>together to create emotions<br>our emotions are not built into our<br>brains from birth<br>to be triggered by outside forces<br>but events that our brains construct<br>shaped by our experience<br>our language and our culture<br>as a university distinguished professor<br>of psychology at northeastern university<br>with appointments at harvard medical<br>school and massachusetts general<br>hospital<br>dr barrett's work in cognitive social<br>and effective neuroscience<br>has significant implications for both<br>everyday<br>and high-stakes interactions<br>her book how emotions are made the<br>secret life of the brain<br>brought dr barrett's work to a general<br>audience<br>while five other scholarly books and<br>more than 200 peer-reviewed scientific<br>papers<br>reflect the impact of her research on a<br>range of fields<br>dr barrett is the current president of<br>the association for psychological<br>science<br>a global organization of more than 30<br>000 members<br>she's also an elected fellow of the<br>american academy of arts and sciences<br>and the royal society of canada<br>in 2007 dr barrett was recognized with<br>the u.s<br>national institutes of health director's<br>pioneer award<br>for her research on emotion in the brain<br>she received a mentor award for lifetime<br>achievement from the association for<br>psychological science in 2018.<br>the mentor award acknowledges dr<br>barrett's skill and leadership in<br>fostering the careers of others<br>and helping students discover their<br>career and research<br>goals a guggenheim fellowship<br>for her pioneering approach to human<br>emotion and psychology<br>the university of wakata was proud to<br>confer upon dr lisa feldman barrett<br>this honorary doctorate so now could i<br>ask the chancellor<br>and dr barrett to stand to allow the<br>chancellor i have the honour to present<br>for the confirmative the degree of<br>honorary doctor of the university of<br>waikato<br>lisa feldman barrett<br>vice chancellor professor quigley<br>ladies and gentlemen i<br>anand satyaland chancellor of the<br>university of waikato<br>by virtue of the authority visited in me<br>to now confer the honorary doctorate of<br>the university of waikato<br>one of the two homes of the dairy<br>industry in new zealand so you have to<br>have<br>a university cow as well and this is a<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
