quigley<br>and professor allison kirkman and amanda<br>till who organized all of us the school<br>of psychology<br>and particularly marianne gary<br>for inviting me here to talk to you<br>today it's really a wonderful honor and<br>i'm<br>i'm a little bit overwhelmed by the uh<br>doctorate i'm very grateful it's<br>it's a very wonderful honor to have um<br>i should also do a little bit of<br>self-handicapping<br>before i start uh it's basically 12 30<br>in the morning for me uh right now uh<br>and so uh i will um<br>uh thank you for your patience if i seem<br>to go blank in a moment<br>it's just really because i'm probably<br>searching for a word<br>uh which is probably buried deep inside<br>my brain somewhere<br>but i do want to thank everybody for<br>showing up today and<br>uh for your enthusiasm uh<br>about uh the work that that my lab has<br>done<br>and uh to reward you i'm going to<br>give you a a fairly provocative talk or<br>what i hope is a<br>very provocative talk um and perhaps<br>challenge some of your deeply held<br>beliefs<br>i think we all know that there are lots<br>of examples of fictions in science we<br>used to believe that the sun revolved<br>around the earth<br>we used to believe that the earth was<br>flat and it turns out that<br>many of our most cherished beliefs about<br>emotion<br>are fictions and so for the next 30<br>minutes or so<br>we're gonna have a go at squashing<br>three of these fictions and maybe put<br>some<br>uh real science uh in their place<br>and the first fiction that we're going<br>to take on this evening<br>is the idea that emotions are expressed<br>on the face<br>in a characteristic way so the idea<br>is that we're supposed to all smile when<br>we're happy we're supposed to frown when<br>we're sad<br>we're supposed to scowl when we're angry<br>everyone around the world<br>is supposed to make these expressions<br>and we're all supposed to be able to<br>recognize smiles and frowns and scowls<br>as expressions of emotion that it was<br>the dominant view<br>in science for the last 50 years<br>and it's still a very very popular view<br>around<br>in many parts of the world um in<br>in the popular um in in popular culture<br>so let's consider the evidence and i<br>should<br>say i'm going to present a little bit of<br>data to you this evening because<br>i am a scientist and if i even in a<br>public talk if i don't present a little<br>bit of data<br>you know they're going to take my phd<br>away so<br>so we're just going to consider a little<br>bit of evidence and along<br>the horizontal axis here i'm just going<br>to show you<br>the expressive forms on the face that<br>have been proposed<br>as universal and on<br>the vertical axis uh we will look at the<br>proportion of times<br>that people actually make these<br>expressions um<br>in uh the proposed uh instances of<br>emotion so how often do people<br>actually scowl when they're angry how<br>often do they smile<br>when they're happy and it turns out<br>not so much these data<br>come from a meta-analysis which is a<br>statistical summary of published<br>research<br>and what they show is a very consistent<br>pattern so let's take scowling and anger<br>for example<br>approximately 28 of the time<br>when we measure how people move their<br>faces when they're angry<br>they scowl that's above<br>chance it's more than what you would<br>expect by chance so that gets you a<br>publication<br>in a peer-reviewed journal but what it<br>means<br>is that approximately 70 of the time<br>people are doing something other than<br>scowling when they feel angry<br>they might be crying they might be<br>smiling<br>they might be you know sitting with a<br>very still face plotting the demise<br>of their enemy this is what<br>scientists would call low reliability<br>meaning you don't move your face in a<br>random way when you're angry but you<br>rarely smile i mean you rarely scowl<br>actually you might smile i don't know<br>if you think about it when you think<br>about actors for example how often do<br>they win<br>acting awards for scowling and anger<br>it's not it's not a really common thing<br>in even in uh you know<br>western cultures uh where the the<br>these expressions were supposed to have<br>evolved<br>we can also ask the question um<br>well how often do people scowl when<br>they're not angry this is the question<br>of specificity<br>so it turns out people scowl for lots of<br>reasons they scowl when they're<br>concentrating<br>they scowl when they're confused they<br>scowl when someone tells them a bad joke<br>they scowl when they have gas people<br>scowl for a lot of reasons when they're<br>not angry<br>which means that scowling is not a very<br>specific<br>expression of anger so people<br>sometimes scowl when they're angry but<br>not often and they scowl at times when<br>they're not<br>angry which means low reliability low<br>specificity and this is true for every<br>proposed expression<br>um that has been um suggest where<br>there's been a suggestion that they're<br>universal that these expressions are<br>universal<br>but compare these findings to these<br>findings<br>these are the proportion of times that<br>when<br>test subjects are given these posed<br>faces<br>at with a set of emotion words and<br>they're asked to pick the word that<br>matches the face<br>this is the percentage of time that<br>people label these as expressions when i<br>say people<br>i'm first going to be talking about<br>people who live in<br>large urban settings<br>as opposed to people who live in in very<br>remote uh<br>cultures so people<br>typically label these faces perceive<br>these spaces as characteristic<br>expressions of emotion<br>even though people don't actually make<br>them very frequently<br>that's what we're seeing here and when<br>we look<br>in people who live in remote small-scale<br>cultures<br>uh what what we see is uh even less<br>evidence of universal<br>emotional expressions so uh between<br>the 1960s and 2007<br>um actually there's a map up there<br>can you i think it's not it's on my<br>screen but<br>i don't think it's showing on the screen<br>up here that's very strange well<br>imagine a map of the world that's what<br>you're that's what you're looking at<br>and what i'm showing you here are the<br>locations<br>of four samples that were<br>um collected where uh<br>paul ekman and other scientists<br>traipsed out to very rural parts of<br>papua new guinea in the 1960s<br>and showed people these posed<br>expressions<br>and asked them to match these<br>expressions to little stories about<br>emotion<br>like bobby's dog died bobby is sad<br>pick the expression that you know that<br>bobby would make<br>and in those studies um<br>they found that that people in papua new<br>guinea<br>very remote uh cultures cultural<br>contexts where people didn't have that<br>much access to<br>western cultural practices and norms<br>they found that people<br>matched the face to emotion stories at<br>the same about the same proportion as<br>uh occurred in the united states in in<br>urban samples<br>and based on these four based actually<br>on three samples out of these<br>uh four that were published in two peer<br>review papers<br>that constituted the strongest evidence<br>for universal expressions<br>until 2008 when<br>these studies were published<br>also you have to continue to imagine<br>that i'm happy to actually show<br>if any of you are real scientists you<br>want to really see that there really is<br>a map<br>actually on the screen i'm happy to show<br>you but<br>um really in this period many many more<br>samples were taken across many many more<br>cultural<br>contexts including hunter-gatherers in<br>sub-saharan africa<br>by my lab and what we find is very<br>consistently<br>no evidence at all of<br>any universal expressions so in these<br>cultures<br>people don't typically scowl<br>in anger or label scowling faces as<br>angry<br>even necessarily above chance<br>and i'll just give you one example<br>because i think it's pretty interesting<br>this is the stereotype the predicted<br>expression of fear that is supposed to<br>be universal i should point out that<br>and many cultures actually have ideas<br>about universal expressions<br>if you compare them though in china in<br>india<br>um in the u.s also historically in<br>france<br>um in germany uh ev all of these<br>different cultural contexts have their<br>own set<br>of expressions that are supposed to be<br>universal and they actually don't look<br>very much like each other<br>this space is supposed to be the<br>universal expression of<br>fear and here what i'm doing is i'm just<br>coding for you<br>what are called the action units the<br>facial action units the muscle movements<br>of um widening of raising the eyebrow<br>inner and outer eyebrows widening the<br>eye<br>and what's really interesting is in the<br>trobriand islands<br>um in papua new guinea this is<br>actually um considered to be a threat<br>face<br>or an anger phase so in studies by<br>carlos crevelli and his colleagues um 39<br>of test subjects in the tropian islands<br>uh labeled this as a fear face which is<br>more than<br>chance um but uh<br>56 percent labeled it as an anger face<br>and in<br>another study uh 60 i think 69<br>labeled it as a threat phase<br>and the reason why i pointed out to you<br>is that<br>uh the maori warrior face actually has<br>the same action units um<br>in the eye region as this um stereotypic<br>fear face from<br>western culture so i think it's a really<br>good example actually of um<br>of variability uh in um in facial uh<br>expressions of emotion so the punchline<br>here if we were to summarize hundreds<br>and hundreds and hundreds of studies<br>would be this<br>if we look at this girl's face out of<br>context she looks<br>sad or grieving<br>or maybe in pain but this actually is my<br>daughter sophia<br>from a couple of years ago when we were<br>in cologne germany at the chocolate<br>museum<br>she's on her second chocolate drink<br>and i would describe her emotional<br>state as profound pleasure<br>oh is also feeling profound pleasure<br>and so the lesson here is that<br>different instances of the same<br>uh emotion um category can be expressed<br>with very very different facial<br>expressions<br>and if we just look at this little guy's<br>eyebrow region<br>we can see that it looks very similar to<br>this guy<br>who is usually seen as absolutely<br>enraged<br>but actually in context you can see he's<br>absolutely elated<br>and in the u.s when i uh use this image<br>i like to use this image because this is<br>a picture<br>of jim webb who in 2006<br>won the senatorial race in virginia<br>and returned the us senate to democratic<br>control<br>so when i'm in the u.s i usually invite<br>people to just<br>simulate what that would be like for a<br>minute<br>um<br>and without context his face<br>looks angry because this is the symbol<br>of anger<br>western symbol of anger so not only do<br>people move their faces in very<br>different ways<br>during instances of the same emotion<br>category<br>they also move their faces in exactly<br>the same way<br>in instances of different emotion<br>categories we all do this<br>and so what this means is that when it<br>comes to emotion a face does not speak<br>for itself<br>when you see emotion in another person's<br>face<br>it feels to you like you're reading<br>emotion in their face<br>but actually your brain is guessing<br>what the facial movements mean and this<br>guessing occurs<br>very automatically with very little<br>effort on your part<br>and even if you're someone like me who<br>believes<br>is very confident that you can read<br>emotion in someone else really your<br>brain is just guessing<br>it's important to be humble about these<br>things<br>because this is how a single physical<br>feature<br>like the curl of a lip or the rays of an<br>eyebrow<br>or the tilt of a head can take on very<br>very different emotional meanings<br>in in different contexts the punch line<br>for tonight is going to be that<br>variation is the norm<br>this is true when it comes to facial<br>expressions of emotion and as we see<br>it's actually true when it comes to any<br>kind of measurement that we take<br>uh related to emotion and so<br>where do these like what's up with these<br>expressions like where did they come<br>from<br>well i can tell you that they did not<br>come from<br>observing how people move their faces<br>in everyday life these expressions<br>were stipulated so<br>some scientists got together and said we<br>think this is what the expression of<br>anger is universally<br>and then built an entire science around<br>these faces<br>the majority of studies that are<br>published<br>on emotional expressions actually use<br>these faces<br>and what the data the pattern of the<br>data what it shows us<br>is that these are stereotypes they<br>represent people's beliefs<br>about how we express emotion on the face<br>but not actually how people uh<br>express emotion which is much more<br>highly variable they're stereotypes<br>so why does this matter why does it<br>matter that<br>that science has employed these these<br>stereotypes<br>well one reason is that<br>if you walk into any preschool in north<br>america<br>and even in i'm not actually sure if<br>it's true here it's certainly true in<br>europe<br>you will find games and puzzles<br>and books and posters that teach<br>children these stereotypes<br>so basically we've been teaching<br>uh little kids stereotypes as if they<br>are the real phenomenon<br>for the last 50 years not just<br>and not just to little kids this<br>represents what's in<br>every introductory psychology textbook<br>it's also what we teach to our patients<br>so<br>autistic children children on the<br>spectrum people who are struggling with<br>schizophrenia are taught these as the<br>expressions of emotion<br>um and also the media<br>has been very puzzled to learn that<br>these are actually not universal as<br>claimed<br>and also there's a growing economy right<br>now of emotion reading gadgets<br>apps and algorithms tech companies<br>who are claiming that they can read<br>emotion<br>in people's faces just by electronic<br>means<br>there's this is a really serious issue<br>because some of this technology is being<br>rolled out in classrooms to determine<br>who gets access<br>to educational opportunities it's being<br>used in<br>hiring practices in companies around the<br>world it's<br>now also being used in legal contexts<br>um and uh it's really serious because<br>that<br>we're basically those the companies who<br>are claiming<br>that they can detect emotion<br>in people's faces are conflating<br>the ability to detect a movement<br>with what that movement means<br>psychologically so the best technology<br>right now under<br>ideal conditions which means a full<br>frontal<br>exposure under perfect lighting<br>conditions can<br>do a really good job of detecting a<br>scowl<br>but not what that scowl means and so<br>companies are making claims about<br>detecting emotion when really what they<br>can detect our facial movements<br>uh uh not um not necessarily what the<br>movements mean<br>and i should point out i i actually<br>think that<br>from a scientific standpoint one of the<br>most<br>serious issues here in addition to the<br>fact that it's<br>maybe uh prematurely being used in these<br>contexts with<br>which can actually determine people's<br>outcomes um<br>is uh that we're missing a really<br>important opportunity because companies<br>are spending millions of dollars and<br>person hours of the<br>cleverest people on this planet asking<br>really simplistic questions with really<br>powerful technology that actually could<br>be used<br>to learn finally something about the<br>variability with which we all express<br>emotion in our faces in different<br>contexts<br>the second uh myth uh<br>uh is the idea that each emotion<br>category comes with its own<br>signature of physical changes in the<br>body so this is the idea that<br>um there's a signature of<br>changes in the heart changes in<br>breathing changes in sweating and so on<br>that are distinguished distinguishable<br>for each emotion<br>category so again i'm going to show you<br>a little bit of data<br>this time again from a meta-analysis<br>which is a statistical summary of<br>published research so here i'm showing<br>you<br>an analysis that my lab did on over 200<br>studies<br>coming using i think over 20 000 test<br>subjects<br>i'm asking the question whether there<br>are<br>patterns of changes in the physical in<br>physical changes in the body<br>that correspond or map to<br>distinct emotion categories and so on<br>the horizontal axis i'm showing you the<br>average amount of change in the physical<br>um signal compared to baseline a resting<br>baseline so how much did a person's<br>heart rate change how much did the<br>amount of blood<br>pump by the heart change how much uh<br>resistance or<br>um uh how much were blood vessels<br>constricted versus dilated and so on so<br>along this uh y um axis the<br>vertical axis here we just list the<br>measures of um the autonomic nervous<br>system that are typically used<br>and um so<br>here the the<br>um the shape here represents<br>the average uh change<br>for example in a neutral induction where<br>we're showing people images or playing<br>the movies or<br>having them remember instances that are<br>intended to keep them neutral<br>feeling very neutral and so the size of<br>the shape<br>indicates the number of studies that<br>were available to be summarized<br>so for example for um heart rate<br>what we see is that um on average<br>it's less than uh a 10 change<br>um but this the wings here represent<br>the degree to which the findings vary<br>across studies<br>so for the scientists in the audience<br>this is a 95 confidence interval<br>and so what you can see is that on<br>average uh heart rate goes up a little<br>bit but actually in some studies<br>it it goes down and and in general we<br>would say this is not<br>different from zero because it crosses<br>the wings across the<br>zero line here um in fact<br>in all of the neutral in all of the<br>studies<br>which use a neutral induction on average<br>you know there's no real um physical<br>change although sometimes<br>in a given study a person's physical<br>changes might um<br>might be higher than baseline and<br>sometimes might be lower and so if<br>there's actually a pattern here<br>that's distinct for each emotion<br>category what we would expect to see<br>is that this that um the shapes don't<br>overlap<br>and neither do the wings so we want to<br>see real distinctiveness<br>but that is actually not what we see so<br>here are the findings for anger<br>so what this means for example is<br>on average blood pressure goes up<br>about 34 35 of the time<br>um or actually sorry not percent of the<br>time it's actually that's a percent<br>change over um<br>over uh baseline so on average blood<br>pressure goes up<br>but sometimes it goes up a lot and<br>and here are the findings for fear and<br>disgust<br>and sadness and happiness there's<br>complete overlap<br>this doesn't mean that your body does<br>random things<br>in emotion what it means is that<br>sometimes<br>when you're angry your blood pressure<br>goes up a little<br>and sometimes it goes up a lot sometimes<br>when you're sad your<br>heart rate goes up a little and<br>sometimes it goes up a lot<br>sometimes when you're<br>fearful your<br>heart rate goes up a little and<br>sometimes it goes up a lot<br>basically there's nothing predictable<br>here about an individual physical signal<br>or a pattern so even if you use machine<br>learning techniques<br>there's really nothing distinctive here<br>and if you think about it again<br>variation is the norm think about<br>when you're happy for example what are<br>some things that you might do<br>you might take a walk in the woods<br>you might lie on a beach and relax<br>you might bake cookies for your friends<br>you might do yoga<br>you might gossip i mean you might chat<br>with a friend<br>uh having coffee you might garden in<br>each of these cases<br>your physical the physical changes in<br>your body<br>are going to track your actions or your<br>prediction<br>actions this is something that has been<br>known in physiology since the 1970s<br>and so if you engage in different<br>actions during instances of the same<br>emotion<br>happiness then your body will be doing<br>different things<br>um it's not just the case that your body<br>will do different things<br>in instances of the same emotion<br>category it's also the case<br>that your body can do the same thing in<br>instances of different emotion<br>categories<br>and sometimes even um<br>in instances which are not considered uh<br>to be emotions<br>for example it's very common<br>for people particularly women<br>to have a racing heart and<br>make sense of those sensations as<br>anxiety<br>go to an emergency room the physician<br>in the emergency room will interview the<br>woman determine<br>that she is anxious send to her home<br>and then she dies of a heart attack<br>later this is actually more common<br>women actually over the age of 65 die<br>more frequently than men from heart<br>attacks because when a man<br>is uh you know appears in in the<br>emergency room um<br>there's more uh interrogation about<br>whether or not uh he is having a uh<br>whether or not the his um anxiety<br>symptoms are actually<br>authentically uh a predictor of an<br>impending cardiac event<br>and this actually happened<br>to my publicist in the uk from my book<br>her mother<br>died this way and<br>there's a really interesting story that<br>my friend jim cohn who is a<br>psychophysiologist i might add<br>what happened to him was something very<br>similar to this and he tells the story i<br>should say<br>he tells a story much better than i do<br>on his podcast circle of willis um in uh<br>i think last year's uh halloween version<br>uh or story he tells the story but<br>basically<br>he was having a racing heart<br>and ver and sweating a lot and having<br>what he what his brain was making sense<br>of as<br>anxiety symptoms and he went to his<br>doctor and his doctor said oh you're<br>just feeling really anxious<br>and so he went home and laid down<br>at with his racing heart and his um<br>sweaty palms<br>and as he was drifting off to sleep he<br>remembered a conversation that he and i<br>had had<br>about this idea the findings<br>that a physical signal like a racing<br>heart<br>doesn't have inherent emotional meaning<br>it can<br>be made your brain can make sense of it<br>as part of<br>many different emotion instances and<br>sometimes even<br>be mistaken for it's exactly the same<br>physical signal but it's indicating<br>an impending cardiac event and so on his<br>podcast i was telling him the story<br>about my publicist mother<br>and he was stripping off asleep and<br>realized maybe i should go to the<br>hospital<br>and just have this checked out um and so<br>you know if they send me home<br>we can have anxieties i'll be a little<br>embarrassed but at least i'll have some<br>peace of mind<br>and so he went to the hospital and they<br>checked him out<br>and he they couldn't find anything wrong<br>and this is the point at which<br>they would have sent him home if he had<br>been a woman<br>but he was he was it was the pain was<br>getting<br>worse his chest was the anxiety was<br>intensity less<br>and becoming more intense and so the<br>emergency room doctor said okay just<br>wait a second i'll go get the<br>cardiologist<br>and as the cardiologist was walking into<br>the room<br>he had what doctors call the widowmaker<br>he had a massive coronary and if he had<br>been<br>the moral of the story here is<br>that emotions are not written<br>in your body they are constructed<br>by your brain so the body does not keep<br>score<br>your brain keeps score and it directs<br>your body<br>and it makes sense of the sensations<br>that come from your body<br>and this is the way that an ache in your<br>stomach<br>can be anxiety if you're waiting for a<br>test result<br>it can be hunger if it's dinner time<br>it can be longing if you miss someone<br>who's close to you<br>and it can be a gut feeling that<br>somebody is guilty<br>your brain is baking basically making<br>physiological changes meaningful as<br>emotion and if we think about how the<br>brain works<br>we can see that this these findings make<br>a lot of sense<br>basically your brain's job really why<br>i mean brains evolved for many reasons<br>but the main reason that brains evolved<br>is to control the body<br>so your brain's main job is to budget<br>the internal resources<br>of your body like water and salt and<br>glucose and hormones and so on<br>to keep you alive and well so you know<br>you can do<br>nature's most important job which is<br>to pass your genes on to the next<br>generation<br>and this continually continually<br>budgeting<br>is largely invisible to you it continues<br>day and night from the moment that<br>you're born until the moment that you<br>die<br>but you are not wired to perceive it so<br>right now<br>each of you is sitting there just<br>enraptured by my words<br>and you are largely unaware unless<br>you're very hungry because it's dinner<br>time<br>you're largely unaware that there isn't<br>a<br>whole drama going on inside your body<br>you're just not wired to perceive it<br>because which is good actually because<br>if you were<br>you would never pay attention to<br>anything outside<br>your own skin ever again and so what<br>what evolution has fashioned you with is<br>not exquisite um sensitivity to<br>the internal the sensations that come<br>from budgeting this budgeting process<br>but but something<br>like more general so<br>basically if if vision seeing<br>is like high definition television then<br>the your ability to detect your<br>sensations inside your own body is more<br>like<br>black and white 1950 you know black and<br>white television 1950s you know<br>reception during like a bad<br>rain storm it's just you have this fuzzy<br>sense<br>of feeling um pleasant or unpleasant<br>feeling worked up or feeling calm it's<br>basically like this general<br>barometer that everything is you know<br>copacetic and good with your body budget<br>or maybe you are running a deficit and<br>you're feeling<br>uh kind of crappy and we have a very<br>fancy name for that we call it<br>mood so mood<br>is again you know your brain is always<br>running a budget for your body<br>it's always calculating what to spend<br>and what deposits will come<br>and so mood is always with you as well<br>because it is the way<br>that your brain makes available to you<br>this the state of your body budget<br>and so sometimes you feel really calm<br>and good and sometimes you feel really<br>crappy sometimes you feel<br>this is basically like a very quick kind<br>of back of the envelope<br>signal without much detail actually<br>scientists call this<br>affect so affect and mood<br>are are really the same thing because<br>you know you know something is really<br>important in science<br>uh when it has more than one name and<br>your brain basically<br>so when you feel crappy what what do you<br>do<br>well probably lots of things right it<br>depends on the context and so the point<br>is<br>there's really not enough information<br>it's not like<br>you know affect your mood it's not like<br>a um<br>not like a smart watch you know that<br>tells you uh whether you should eat<br>or whether you should have coffee or<br>whether you should have a nap<br>it doesn't really tell you anything<br>other than something is wrong and i<br>should probably do something about it so<br>what your brain really has to do<br>is link those sensations that that it's<br>experiencing as affect<br>to the context to try to figure out what<br>caused them and that really<br>is what results in an emotion but not<br>always<br>sometimes your brain makes sense of<br>those sensations and that<br>and so understanding that is important<br>doctor<br>the third myth that we'll tackle today<br>or fiction is the idea that there are<br>dedicated<br>uh circuits in the brain for emotion so<br>emotions feel like they happen to us<br>like they're taking over<br>our behavior and uh causing us to do<br>or say things that we probably<br>wish we hadn't a lot of the time and so<br>this<br>experience of being taken over really<br>makes it<br>seem to us like we have these we have<br>some kind of<br>inner beast you know that is like these<br>circuits for emotion that are just baked<br>into our brains at birth<br>and that something in the world will<br>just trigger one of these<br>um circuits and then an emotion will<br>erupt uh and take over our<br>um over our thoughts and our actions<br>but if there's one thing that we know<br>about the brain after all this time it's<br>that our subjective experience<br>doesn't really reveal to us<br>how a brain works how your brain works<br>so let's take one example we're going to<br>just talk about the amygdala<br>so here what you're looking at is what's<br>called a coronal slice of the brain<br>so this is the top of the brain this is<br>the bottom<br>and so this is the image if you took<br>a slice of if you sort of sliced into<br>the skull like this and you just<br>popped open the front and you looked in<br>a mirror and you wiped away all the<br>blood<br>that's come on that was funny oh i mean<br>you got<br>thank you that's what you would see and<br>you actually have two<br>amygdala which are clusters of neurons<br>on each side of the brain<br>the amygdala how many of you here have<br>heard of an amygdala<br>yeah it's like the rock star of the<br>brain everybody you know if you read in<br>the newspaper an article about the brain<br>the likelihood is over 70 percent<br>of the time it's usually a story about<br>the amygdala and the amygdala is<br>supposed to contain<br>uh or many people many scientists<br>thought for a very long time<br>that the amygdala contained the<br>circuitry for fear<br>so again a meta-analysis this time<br>we're looking at the proportion of<br>studies uh<br>which show an increase in amygdala<br>activity<br>during instances of fear and what we see<br>is about 30<br>of the time in experiments where people<br>are experiencing fear<br>while having their brain scanned we see<br>an increase in activity in the amygdala<br>over baseline<br>so again that's better than chance<br>right that will get you a pna sort of an<br>article in the proceedings of the<br>national academy of sciences<br>in the us but<br>that means 70 of the time there's no<br>change<br>in your amygdala when you're feeling<br>fear if these<br>studies generalize to the public<br>and that means that's<br>really much more than we would expect by<br>chance and actually<br>so low reliability and actually every<br>uh emotion that's ever been studied in a<br>scanner<br>shows an increase in amygdala activity<br>some proportion of the time which is<br>more than chance and actually<br>we see amygdala activity increase all<br>the time in the scanner<br>in studies that have nothing to do with<br>emotion at all so for example if i just<br>stick you in a scanner<br>and i show you images of faces or just<br>scenes<br>that you've never seen before your<br>amygdala will go<br>nuts in fact shortly i'm going to show<br>you an image<br>which i would love to i'll have<br>importable brain scanners to scan all of<br>you while i show you this image because<br>this is anytime your brain doesn't know<br>what it's looking at<br>doesn't know what it's hearing can't<br>identify<br>either because it's ambiguous or it's<br>uncertain your amygdala basically is<br>like a sentinel<br>which signals to the rest of the brain<br>please learn this<br>please take in this information so that<br>i can better predict<br>and better understand what this signal<br>is the next time<br>and every study that's ever proposed<br>a specific brain region as the home of<br>an emotion circuit<br>we see evidence like this which is lack<br>of specificity and low reliability<br>again that doesn't mean that emotions<br>don't live in the brain and it doesn't<br>mean<br>that that all of this is random what it<br>means is<br>again that variability is the norm<br>and this is true whether you're looking<br>at brain imaging studies or even<br>looking at um structural studies<br>of people with amygdala lesions so here<br>what you're looking at<br>um are um two structural images of the<br>of<br>of the brain these are two sisters who<br>are identical twins<br>so they have 100 of their genetic<br>material is the same<br>and both of these sisters at the age of<br>12<br>their amygdala's calcified so what<br>you're looking at here is what's called<br>a horizontal slice which is<br>if we slice the brain that way and we<br>pop off the top and look down<br>this is what we see without the pretty<br>colors this is the front<br>of the brain here and this is the back<br>so and the the colors are really where<br>the amygdalas used to be before they<br>were<br>were destroyed sister bg<br>has difficulties experiencing fear<br>except in the most extreme circumstances<br>she can experience fear but<br>in average everyday experiences are she<br>doesn't experience fear<br>and she also has a hard time seeing fear<br>in the faces of other people<br>but her sister who has exactly<br>who has exactly the same i don't know<br>what happened there who has exactly the<br>same<br>damage and exactly the same genes and<br>very very similar<br>experiences has no problems<br>experiencing or perceiving fear at all<br>her brain has learned to make fear in a<br>completely different way<br>which brain imaging studies of her have<br>have confirmed<br>so what this means is that you when you<br>feel<br>fear your brain does different things<br>at different times just like you will<br>express fear differently on your face<br>at different in different contexts and<br>your body will<br>will have different changes during fear<br>depending<br>on uh the actions that you take and the<br>and if we oh and there's a spelling<br>mistake because<br>i added this slide last night when it<br>was<br>much too late for me to be working on my<br>talk um<br>uh and if we look at brain imaging<br>studies<br>um uh which use pattern classification<br>so that is we're using machine learning<br>to try to find the pattern for fear<br>um here is a lateral view of the brain<br>which is blown up so like a balloon so<br>you can see<br>all the parts of the cortex so the<br>cortex usually is very foldy<br>and so this is just blown up so you can<br>you can see all the<br>gyro and sulci and so this is the<br>lateral view so<br>you would be looking on the outside like<br>this<br>with the front of the brain here and the<br>back here<br>and this is a medial view of the brain<br>so if you take the two hemispheres<br>and you crack them open like an egg<br>you're looking at the inner surface<br>of one um inside surface of one<br>hemisphere so this is the front and this<br>is the back<br>in my lab we did uh we took that<br>meta-analysis and we used machine<br>learning to try to find the pattern<br>for fear in all of the studies actually<br>for fear and anger<br>sadness i want to hear i'm just showing<br>you the pattern for fear and here's<br>another<br>pattern from another study and here's<br>now it's tempting to think that this is<br>just a lack of replication<br>but really what it is is evidence that<br>variability is the norm<br>and not only that but each of these<br>patterns<br>is not a brain state it's actually<br>just a statistical abstraction<br>necessarily has to show this pattern of<br>activity<br>during fear in order for this pattern<br>to classify that person's experience as<br>fear<br>100 of the time basically these are like<br>averages that don't apply to any<br>specific individual<br>they're they're just a summary so an<br>analogy would be<br>if there are 3.13 people in the average<br>family<br>you know in a country that doesn't mean<br>that every family has 3.13 people in it<br>in fact probably no family has 3.13<br>people in it<br>because it's a statistical abstraction<br>and that's what these are too these are<br>not brain states they're statistical<br>abstractions<br>and this is actually a finding that's<br>very consistent<br>with what we understand about how<br>variability works actually which comes<br>from darwin<br>so emotions are<br>complex constructions in the brain that<br>vary by context<br>they are not simple circuits you do not<br>have<br>mythical emotion circuits buried deep<br>inside some animalistic part of your<br>brain<br>even if it feels that way sometimes<br>your feelings are not a guide to how<br>and furthermore the brain is not a<br>battleground<br>between reason and emotion so<br>there's been this recurring sort of like<br>one of the most cherished<br>narratives in western civilization is<br>that the brain<br>uh is a battleground between thinking<br>and feeling and that the two kind of<br>belted out in contr you know control of<br>your behavior<br>and so there are parts of the brain for<br>emotion and parts of the brain<br>uh for uh reason or rationality and the<br>two are constantly in battle with each<br>other<br>that's just actually a complete fiction<br>complete<br>fiction um<br>so how many of you uh have heard that<br>you have a reptilian brain<br>like our inner reptile yeah uh<br>and maybe also a limbic system which<br>wraps around that reptilian<br>brain so the idea is that you've got<br>these um urges that are in your<br>reptilian brain<br>and that's enrobed by emotion in your<br>limbic system<br>and so the limbic system uh was<br>supposedly evolved in mammals<br>and then there's this prodigious<br>neocortex which is all new<br>and the home of rationality and very<br>very big in humans<br>that is a story that actually we can<br>trace<br>all the way back to plato and what's<br>really interesting about this story<br>is that it was popularized um by carl<br>sagan in the 1970s in the<br>pulitzer prize-winning book dragons of<br>eden<br>at exactly the same time<br>that neuroscientists who were<br>using molecular genetics that is typing<br>of neurons by their genetic<br>profiles we're demonstrating that this<br>but if you look in books<br>about emotion like popular science books<br>if you read the newspaper<br>if you ever take a<br>like a leadership training course in<br>industry<br>if you read anything about emotional<br>intelligence other than what i've<br>written<br>you will you will learn that<br>uh your neocortex is controlling your<br>inner beast<br>um and what about system one and system<br>two<br>these are um you know uh uh<br>tweedledee and tweedledum uh talked<br>about uh in<br>the uh award-winning book uh thinking<br>fast and slow by uh nobel prize winner<br>danny kahneman<br>the idea here is that system one is this<br>really quick<br>automatic emotional system and system<br>two is this more deliberate<br>um rational system well<br>if you actually look in thinking fast<br>and slow<br>danny kahneman is really really clear<br>that this is a metaphor<br>it's a metaphor uh for the fact that<br>sometimes we do things on autopilot<br>and sometimes we do things that have a<br>sense of effort<br>but he never really meant to say and in<br>fact he's very clear about this<br>expressly in the book um i want to say<br>it's on page 11 but i don't<br>that might just be i'm not sure actually<br>but anyways at the beginning of the book<br>and uh in my book i actually list the<br>page number where he basically says this<br>is just a metaphor<br>nonetheless many neuroscientists and<br>many many journalists<br>talk about these as actual systems in<br>the brain when in fact what they are<br>are modes of processing in the brain<br>this um is important because still in<br>the law<br>and economics there's this idea of this<br>battle between um the you know<br>more reasoned rational and the more<br>flighty emotional<br>systems uh and uh that really has to be<br>modified to be accurate um<br>with the neuroscience that we know so<br>what what do we know<br>about emotion well we know that emotions<br>are not built in<br>to the brain from birth they're built by<br>the brain<br>as we need them and i'm<br>rather than show you a ton of evidence<br>which you know is<br>to some of which is described in the<br>book and also in web notes that<br>go along with the book i'm just going to<br>give you an experience that hopefully<br>so<br>take a look at this right now<br>your the ner actually your amygdala<br>should be going crazy<br>even though you can't sense that<br>because your brain is trying to guess<br>uh what this might be like what is it so<br>anybody anything<br>sorry snowman and eyes<br>so basically your brain is searching<br>through your lifetime of past experience<br>issuing thousands of guesses weighing<br>probabilities<br>trying to answer the question what is<br>this most like<br>not what is this but what is this most<br>similar to<br>now in psychology a group of things<br>which are<br>similar to each other is what we call a<br>category<br>and a mental representation of a<br>category how your brain represents a<br>category is called a concept<br>so what your brain is doing right now is<br>it's looking at these blobs<br>and it's trying to form a concept so<br>that you can see an<br>image instead of black and white blobs<br>it's asking what is this similar to in<br>my past and what was it the last time i<br>saw it<br>or something like it but of course<br>you've never seen anything like<br>it most of you unless you've watched one<br>of my talks on um<br>on uh on youtube um and so what you're<br>experiencing if you can't see anything<br>other than blobs is called experiential<br>blindness<br>and so now i'm gonna cure you of your<br>blindness<br>are you ready to be cured of your<br>blindness<br>are you ready to be cured of your<br>blindness<br>come on i want to hear it<br>all right now<br>how many of you see a b or<br>part of a b yeah<br>because now when your brain searches<br>through your past experience<br>there's new knowledge there from the<br>color photograph<br>and that knowledge that is in your head<br>changes how you experience these blobs<br>the blobs the visual input from this<br>image is exactly<br>the same as it was before but what you<br>see<br>what you literally see is a combination<br>of the information from the screen<br>and the information that is now in your<br>head<br>because your brain is making sense<br>of this uh information<br>so that you see lines that aren't there<br>to see an image that actually is not<br>present<br>so when you experience an increase in<br>heart rate<br>as anxiety or as determination<br>like i'm going to get my butterflies<br>flying in formation and<br>you know knock this test out of the park<br>your brain<br>is categorizing making a concept that<br>will make sense of the sensory inputs<br>just like it's making the sense of the<br>visual inputs from this<br>uh image to see something that actually<br>isn't physically present<br>and this kind of a hallucination<br>is um actually how it's like business as<br>usual for your brain<br>and we need a very special set of<br>examples to demonstrate this to you<br>but basically this is what your brain is<br>doing all the time it's making sense<br>of sensory inputs from the world and<br>from the body<br>to basically construct your experience<br>and guide your actions<br>and this is how your this is business as<br>usual for your brain<br>this is really how your brain makes all<br>your experiences<br>and uh basically<br>guides all your actions when your brain<br>so for example<br>now that you can see this as a bee if i<br>had you hooked up<br>to monitors if your brain was drawing on<br>past<br>instances of fear because maybe you were<br>stung by a bee<br>then your heart rate would go up it<br>would speed you'd start to sweat<br>even if i just showed you this image<br>like this<br>however if your brain was drawing on<br>past instances<br>of say interest because you were a<br>beekeeper<br>or maybe pleasure because you're a<br>gardener<br>then you would have a completely<br>different physical reaction<br>because your brain is making sense<br>uh it's constructing a cons a concept to<br>make sense of those sensations that come<br>from that image<br>and make it meaningful so that your<br>brain knows what to do um how to control<br>your body<br>and what you you know what you should do<br>next so physical changes in your body<br>have no inherent emotional meaning<br>uh your brain basically makes<br>a physical changes in your body<br>meaningful<br>as emotions um uh<br>by constructing a concept for emotion<br>which is tailored to the specific<br>situation<br>that you're in in a in a given context<br>so your emotions are not your reactions<br>to the world they are your constructions<br>of the world or more precisely their<br>their constructions of what your bodily<br>sensations<br>mean in a specific context or situation<br>that you are in so your brain is<br>creating a motion<br>when it links or explains the internal<br>sensations of your body<br>to what is going on around you in the<br>world so that<br>you know your brain knows how to keep<br>you alive and well<br>and so the bottom line here<br>is that the emotions that seem to happen<br>to you are<br>actually made by you they're made by<br>your brain<br>pretty automatically without any sense<br>of effort or agency on your part<br>and the emotions that you seem to read<br>in other people<br>are actually coming in part<br>from inside your own head when you see<br>a smile as anger or happiness<br>it's because your brain is guessing what<br>that physical signal means<br>in context and that context includes not<br>just the surrounding<br>situation but also your own body because<br>your<br>body is basically a context for your<br>brain that you carry around with you<br>everywhere you go<br>you are in in more than just a<br>metaphorical way you are a<br>an architect of your own experience and<br>that means<br>you don't have a 100 control over what<br>you experience<br>and you don't necessarily have a modicum<br>of control in the moment you can't just<br>snap your fingers and change how you<br>feel that's really hard<br>but you do actually have more control<br>over uh constructing your experience and<br>being the architect of your experience<br>once you understand a little bit about<br>how your brain works<br>and so if you want to learn more about<br>or you could see my new book which is<br>coming out in november<br>which is a little set of essays about<br>the brain<br>or you can go to my website which is i<br>have an academic website where all my<br>publications are but this<br>articles that i've written in the new<br>york times and for lots of magazines and<br>videos and things like that<br>um and before i end i i just have to<br>actually thank the<br>real heroes here who are not the funding<br>agents<br>well they partly are the funding<br>agencies that support this work but<br>really<br>um it's my it's my lab that i co-direct<br>with dr karen quigley who is a<br>psychophysiologist<br>so she she sort of handles everything<br>below the neck<br>and i handle everything above the neck<br>so together we're like one person<br>um and our fantastic team of graduate<br>students and postdoctoral fellows who<br>actually are the real heroes here<br>they're the ones<br>um who do all the hard work i just get<br>to have the fun to stand up here and<br>tell you about it<br>and uh and thank you very much for your<br>attention<br>hello everyone i'm mary ann gary from<br>the school of psychology and uh<br>just before we get started thank you<br>very much for that terrific<br>lecture also psychology is the coolest<br>subject so send your children<br>to the school of psychology it is am i<br>right<br>it's totally thank you very much uh lisa<br>is uh<br>happy to take some questions i really<br>have a lot of<br>trouble seeing right now so if you would<br>yeah really it doesn't work from an<br>angle you have to<br>you have to actually see it uh head on<br>really in order for it to work<br>but let me tell you a different let me<br>let me give us i mean that actually is<br>the real answer but let me give you a<br>different kind of answer<br>so i have a lot of these images they're<br>called mooney images<br>and they're um they're basically blobs<br>and then<br>you know it's very hard like they have<br>them online you know there's like one of<br>a dalmatian<br>in a snowstorm and a cow that should be<br>you guys should like that because cows<br>are big<br>big news around here aren't they i mean<br>i mean stereotypically i have to tell<br>you i was expecting sheep<br>but um but now i've learned better that<br>this is the dairy capital<br>um but my point is that um so i have one<br>that uh we made we we do experiments<br>with them<br>um and it it was actually um a snake<br>it's a snake<br>and so uh i you know i did the thing<br>like i showed the blobby uh<br>image and no one knew what it was and<br>then i showed the snake and then<br>um and then people could see the snake<br>uh<br>and then this woman came up afterwards<br>and she said<br>can you tell me what's wrong with my<br>brain<br>and i was like i don't know i don't know<br>if i can tell you what's wrong with your<br>brain<br>and i said well what's the problem and<br>she said well i<br>saw first you know in the blobby image i<br>saw<br>a louisiana swamp and then<br>when you showed the snake image and then<br>you took it away<br>i saw in the blobby b and the blobby<br>images i saw a snake for like<br>one second and then it went back to<br>being<br>a louisiana swamp what's wrong with my<br>brain<br>and of course at that point what i<br>wanted to say to her is how is it that<br>you're from louisiana and you have no<br>accent<br>but i did not ask that question instead<br>what i said is well how long have you<br>lived in louisiana<br>and she said my whole life and i said<br>well<br>here's what's happening you what we<br>would call your priors<br>your prior experience for seeing<br>a swamp is very strong and<br>what i i just showed you an image for<br>like<br>what like 10 seconds if that and so<br>it's it's prior is very weak<br>and so the point here is that your brain<br>doesn't just isn't just constructing<br>representations from past experience<br>it's also weighing the probabilities or<br>the likelihood that you<br>will that that that uh that concept will<br>actually explain those sensations<br>um and that's true um pretty much<br>uh no matter what you're looking at or<br>hearing or smelling uh<br>it doesn't you know or what you're<br>feeling but the the real answer here is<br>that<br>um uh you probably from the side<br>that image is meant to be viewed um uh<br>really um<br>head-on and probably from the side it's<br>it's actually very difficult for that<br>illusion to work but<br>what i would suggest is we should try it<br>like when you uh<br>when we're done you should go to the<br>back there and i'll do it again and<br>you'll see if you see it i mean you know<br>i'll believe<br>you if you tell me that you sometimes<br>people can't see the whole image but<br>they can see<br>maybe the the bomb like the you know<br>like the what do you call it thorax<br>or they might be able to see um the<br>wings or they might just be able to see<br>the antenna<br>sometimes you have to leave it up there<br>for much longer than you have when<br>you're under a time<br>limit and you only have and you're<br>already running late so<br>it could just be that actually as well<br>yeah<br>yep<br>does having a good memory contribute to<br>um<br>recognizing emotion others or making it<br>easier for you to<br>what that means what having a good<br>memory means<br>colloquially is not what i'm talking<br>about here when i talk about memory<br>so um usually<br>what we say having a good memory means<br>that you consciously uh either have some<br>sense of familiarity with what you've<br>seen or<br>you consciously uh acknowledge that<br>you've seen it before you make a<br>judgment that you've seen it before<br>and that's not really the same<br>as what i talk about when i'm talking<br>about memory basically<br>your brain is<br>always using the past<br>using past experience in order to make<br>sense of the present<br>that's actually how your brain works so<br>uh and you're so your brain is always<br>remembering in a sense um but you don't<br>have an awareness of that<br>happening so i guess the better way to<br>say it is that<br>you know memories aren't stored in your<br>brain and we don't pull them up<br>when we remember really what your brain<br>is doing is it's<br>reconstituting past experience in the<br>connections between neurons<br>and as far as i know no one's ever<br>tested memory<br>in that way to answer your question it's<br>a great question what i can say is that<br>conscious recollection<br>has no relationship to um<br>the facility with which or flexibility<br>with which you<br>experience emotion or a range of<br>emotions which we call emotional<br>granularity<br>or or um perceive emotion in others<br>but what you're talking about or the way<br>we would understand memory<br>in the way that i just described it i<br>think that's an open question actually<br>oh well you have to read my new book<br>actually<br>so um so but you know here's the thing<br>um the uh i do talk about this in<br>in uh how emotions are made actually a<br>little bit<br>and then part of the reason why i wrote<br>seven and a half lessons about the brain<br>is that<br>there's a lot of really good stuff in<br>how emotions are made<br>i think really good science not my<br>science like other i'm writing about<br>other people's work<br>like really cool stuff which largely<br>doesn't get a lot of attention<br>um because uh you know<br>because there's a lot of stuff in that<br>book and<br>one thing that got really overlooked<br>which was driving me kind of<br>nuts um was this idea that we have<br>uh you know sedimentary a brain like is<br>like<br>sedimentary layers you know with the<br>cortex which is like icing on an already<br>baked cake<br>so the actual story is way more<br>interesting<br>and cool um than than that narrative<br>which is false<br>i mean that narrative is basically plato<br>tattooed on the brain<br>right that you have um you know you have<br>urges<br>and instincts you have emotions like two<br>wild stallions and then you have a<br>charioteer who's like trying to control<br>them that's plato<br>that's what you that's really what that<br>what the triune brain is but<br>what really is true is uh seems to be<br>something more like the following<br>every well certainly every mammal that's<br>ever been studied every mammal brain<br>and probably every vertebrate brain on<br>this planet<br>has exactly the same kinds of neurons<br>exactly the same<br>but as brains get bigger<br>they reorganize so a bird brain<br>for example doesn't have a cortex<br>cerebral cortex but it has neurons<br>the same neurons that we have but our<br>neurons<br>are arrayed in a cerebral cortex theirs<br>is not<br>but still there are birds that who can<br>do really<br>who have language uh rudimentary<br>language who can do pretty complex<br>uh problem solving and they are<br>their neurons are wired and function to<br>some extent<br>like parts of our cerebral cortex so<br>the the really cool thing is that if you<br>this is work by<br>uh barbara finley who's a neuroscientist<br>a developmental and evolutionary<br>neuroscientist and what she<br>has shown pretty remarkably is that over<br>200 instances in brain development from<br>from an embryo all the way um to<br>past birth are occur in exactly the same<br>order<br>but in some species<br>certain stages run for longer which<br>means more neurons are born<br>uh at the end so the brains reorganize<br>and so it looks to us<br>if we use a naked eye like a reptile<br>like a lizard doesn't have<br>a cortex but actually a lizard has every<br>kind of neuron that you have in your<br>brain<br>it's just organized differently um and<br>i'm not saying that that means that um<br>that you know lizards have exactly the<br>same uh functions that we have that we<br>can do<br>um but what i am what i am saying is<br>this idea<br>that you have some kind of inner beast<br>which is preserved and that<br>rationality your ability to rationally<br>control<br>uh that inner beast that is a myth<br>rationality has nothing to do with<br>controlling an inner beast<br>it has to do more with how your brain is<br>running your body budget<br>just to put it really simply um<br>you know depression which you can think<br>of as<br>kind of a bankrupt body budget is<br>incredibly rational<br>what do you do when you're running a<br>deficit in your budget<br>you stop spending what are the two most<br>expensive things a brain can do<br>move your body and learn something new<br>which is what you stop doing when you're<br>depressed<br>it's actually very rational so i just<br>think what<br>what what this means is we have to kind<br>of reconsider what what it means to be<br>rational actually<br>but that myth just needs to needs to go<br>away<br>wow what a great question you need to<br>come to my talk tomorrow<br>in the department um<br>so here's what i'm going to say<br>which is going to sound a little<br>preposterous maybe because there isn't<br>really enough time to fully develop<br>it but here's what i'm going to say the<br>idea that variability is the<br>norm actually comes from darwin<br>not darwin's book on emotion which is<br>basically a<br>very anti-darwinian book frankly which<br>also i explained in my book<br>but from on the origin of species so<br>darwin did this really remarkable thing<br>everyone thinks the remarkable thing<br>that he did was discover natural<br>selection and that is remarkable<br>but what he really discovered is that<br>and that's what natural selection acts<br>on so what darwin did is he<br>he observed he was incredibly observant<br>and he observed birds and he observed<br>mollusks and any observed variability in<br>all these animals<br>and before darwin a species was<br>considered to be<br>like a perfect platonic type and any<br>variation in the individuals<br>was considered to be irrelevant error<br>right so you take like a cocker spaniel<br>and it can vary in its size and in its<br>coat<br>thickness and his color and so on and<br>before darwin<br>all of that variability was considered<br>to be error and after darwin<br>that variability became important to<br>explain and in part<br>biologists realize this because he did<br>the super careful<br>observation and mapping of the variation<br>but in psychology we never did that<br>and we never did it for a lot of reasons<br>partly<br>because we didn't really have the<br>methods to do it<br>and now we do what we know what we don't<br>have is money<br>and if that sounds funny and i kind of<br>mean it to be a little cheeky<br>but only a little because the point that<br>i want to make is that the kind of<br>science that we have to do<br>is actually do very big like use big<br>data observation and data analysis on<br>individual people across time<br>in different contexts and that is<br>orders of magnitude more complicated and<br>more expensive than what we currently do<br>now if physicists so basically<br>and what i'm going to tell you is that<br>your brain works like a complex system<br>and your body and where what we know<br>about complex systems the best<br>information that we have comes from<br>physics and chemistry if physicists were<br>funded at the level of psychology<br>and neuroscience that is related to<br>psychology<br>no one ever would have discovered the<br>higgs boson<br>ever so the question<br>is really what could psychologists do<br>with that kind of funding could we<br>actually<br>study emotion and learn something about<br>the variability<br>um and so could i learn in you for<br>example<br>that you have a vocabulary of 10 facial<br>expressions that you make in various<br>contexts when you're angry<br>and maybe you have three for fear and<br>maybe you have you know eight<br>for gratitude and maybe i have you know<br>12 for anger and maybe some of them<br>overlapping maybe they don't<br>maybe they overlap because we're both<br>women and we're both<br>you know speak english and but you know<br>so my point is that<br>we have to do this kind of like really<br>deep observation<br>respects and maps variation and we have<br>the technology to do it<br>and we have the math to do it now what<br>we don't have<br>is the money and like i said that sounds<br>cheeky<br>but it really isn't if this is a<br>question that that the public wants an<br>answer to<br>then you know scientists have to have<br>the ideas<br>and they have to have the will to<br>execute those ideas and they have to<br>have the money<br>to do the studies properly and currently<br>we have two of those things<br>uh lisa philbin barrett<br>you are a rock star warrior<br>scientist changing the face of<br>behavioral science it has been a real<br>thrill to have you here<br>i'm so happy uh my students are walking<br>around<br>saying she's amazing she's much more<br>amazing than you are<br>no uh<br>i want to thank you for everything and<br>thank you all for coming you can pick up<br>a copy of lisa's book<br>outside um she won't be here to sign it<br>for you but you could bring it to<br>wellington<br>on friday where you can see her as part<br>of the new zealand<br>readers and writers week or you can<br>bring it to my office tomorrow and i'll<br>sign up for you<br>in a purple pant yeah yeah anyway thank<br>you very much<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
