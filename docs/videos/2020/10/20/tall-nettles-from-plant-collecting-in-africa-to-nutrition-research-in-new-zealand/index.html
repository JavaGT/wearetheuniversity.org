automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thai<br>it is my great privilege to have been<br>invited to open professor<br>richard martin's inaugural lecture this<br>evening and to welcome you all here<br>apologies that i was not able to join<br>you in person<br>welcome also to our guests joining us by<br>zoom<br>i first met richard a couple of years<br>ago when he first moved to new zealand<br>in one of our early conversations he<br>mentioned just casually<br>that he had been spending his time<br>reading and learning about the history<br>of aotearoa<br>about our cultures and about waitangi<br>and what the treaty means for those of<br>us who live here<br>that really struck me as such a<br>respectful way to begin one's journey in<br>another<br>country and a real acknowledgement to<br>the people of this whenua<br>since then it's been my pleasure to be<br>part of richard's team here<br>welcome at the liggins institute and to<br>work with him<br>as part of the high value nutrition<br>national science challenge<br>in my time getting to know richard his<br>passion and enthusiasm for the native<br>plants and bird life of aotearoa<br>has opened my eyes to the amazing<br>biodiversity<br>that we have here and which it is our<br>responsibility to protect<br>on that note i'm really excited to hear<br>richard's presentation<br>so i'll hand over to professor frank<br>bloomfield to continue getting the<br>thank you associate honorary associate<br>professor mika foster for that mihi and<br>karakia<br>and welcome to all of you both in person<br>and zoom<br>to this inaugural lecture this evening<br>i'm frank bloomfield the<br>director of the liggins institute i'd<br>particularly like to welcome<br>richard's family who have joined us by<br>zoom pat claire<br>stephen david rowan and laura<br>so an inaugural lecture provides a way<br>to celebrate and recognize the mark of<br>distinction<br>conferred by a university when it awards<br>the title of professor<br>the highest academic rank and<br>achievement and achievement well worth<br>celebrating<br>professor maithan has chosen to deliver<br>his lecture in academic regalia<br>this mode of apparel for academics dates<br>back to the 12th century<br>when scholars were all members of<br>religious orders<br>and the clapper cause kappa klauser or<br>the gown<br>is the development of the priestly<br>pluvial the hoods at that time covered<br>the tonsils heads<br>and no doubt and kept the monks warm<br>in the 14th century the statutes of some<br>english colleges forbade<br>excess apparel and prescribed the<br>wearing of long gowns many of which<br>which used to be closed and they still<br>are for many american universities<br>to prevent the individual show of<br>excessive finery<br>richards as you can see is open so you<br>get the full glory of his tie<br>this evening specific details of<br>academic dress were introduced around<br>the time of henry viii<br>at the universities of cambridge and<br>oxford and most regalia in new zealand<br>are based on those specific colors<br>but the current convention of specific<br>colors for different degrees is a<br>relatively recent<br>invention richard's gown is for a phd<br>at the university of east anglia and my<br>one<br>is a phd from the university of auckland<br>as you heard from associate professor<br>michael foster<br>professor mython joined the institute in<br>january 2009<br>from quadrant institute biosciences in<br>norwich the uk<br>but a number of circumstances that i<br>don't need to elaborate for you<br>have meant that this is the first time<br>we've been able to recognize his<br>appointment as a professor to the<br>university of auckland<br>richard started his academic career<br>studying plant science at the university<br>of wales<br>graduating with a first-class honours<br>followed by a phd at the university of<br>east anglia<br>after four years in africa he returned<br>to norwich where he spent most of his<br>career before moving to auckland<br>richard was actually first appointed to<br>professor<br>at the university of east anglia in 2000<br>actually 20 years ago<br>this month and that means that he was an<br>exceptionally young professor indeed<br>and he was also a professor at the<br>university of nottingham before he<br>challenged norwich<br>so this in fact is not his first ever<br>inaugural lecture<br>which is why he's looking so calm and<br>relaxed<br>his career at the institute of food<br>research which later formed a key part<br>of quadrant student biosciences<br>in a joint venture with the university<br>of east anglia and with the nov<br>the norfolk and norwich university<br>hospital was impressive<br>to say the least from research leader to<br>program leader<br>and then acting director of the<br>institute of food research<br>a role in which he was instrumental in<br>the formation of quadrum institute<br>biosciences<br>professor maithan's academic<br>achievements are substantial<br>he's published over 100 papers with an h<br>index<br>which is a commonly cited metric of<br>impact research<br>of 46. one can argue about the merits<br>of these different metrics relating to<br>research publications<br>but what that number means is that<br>almost half of all riches publications<br>have been cited by others at least 46<br>times<br>and many of them hundreds of times and<br>this tells us that when<br>professor meyer writes a paper it is one<br>that has something to say<br>and that others want to know about and<br>to use in their own research<br>he doesn't write papers that once<br>published disappear into the graveyard<br>of publications<br>never to be heard of again professor<br>maithan also has published<br>has filed 11 patents at least eight of<br>which relate to health benefits of foods<br>again demonstrating both the impact and<br>he has always demonstrated a keen<br>interest in students<br>and in the careers of early career<br>researchers<br>he was a member of the doctoral training<br>program board for<br>the norwich research park and also had<br>the role of director of graduate studies<br>for the institute of food research from<br>2010 to 2015<br>and professor maithan has been the<br>primary academic supervisor<br>for over 35 phds which is a<br>substantial achievement so as you can<br>tell<br>from professor maithan's lecture title<br>his career has spanned continents and<br>it's also spanned the breadth of<br>research<br>from plant collection genetic breeding<br>through identification and<br>quantification of specific chemicals<br>implants to testing those chemicals in<br>randomized controlled trials<br>and then to spinning out his own company<br>the smarter food company<br>of which he is founder and chief<br>scientist<br>professor maithan's background therefore<br>places him ideally for the role he has<br>taken up<br>here in otero new zealand as professor<br>of nutrition at the liggins institute<br>and chief scientist of high value<br>nutrition<br>ingar phi panga responsible for leading<br>and directing the science strategy and<br>quality of one of new zealand's national<br>science challenges<br>with a goal of transforming the benefits<br>to new zealand from its food and<br>beverages<br>through excellent science focus on<br>health benefits<br>so richard i'd like you to come and tell<br>us<br>all about tall nettles from plant<br>collecting in africa<br>to nutrition research in new zealand<br>so thank you miko and thank you frank<br>for that very nice<br>introduction um<br>and before i start i've got three<br>comments one to make and firstly<br>and probably most importantly is to<br>really thank the university of auckland<br>for this considerable<br>honor of being appointed professor at<br>this very great university<br>it's not something i've accepted lightly<br>and i hope that<br>my work here will do justice through<br>secondly i i wish to dedicate this next<br>50 minutes or an hour to<br>and my daughter laura and my partner<br>claire<br>and i think that they are zooming in<br>um let me and they were all expecting to<br>spend a substantial part of<br>this year and and did last year in in<br>new zealand but of course<br>events have meant otherwise<br>and so you haven't had a chance to meet<br>them so let me just tell you a little<br>bit about<br>them before i start rowan is in the<br>middle of a medical degree<br>he's training at the moment on the wards<br>north tees hospital<br>in the uk covert hotspots<br>he's a passionate surfer<br>and a a pretty good chess player not<br>quite as good as his father of course<br>but<br>you know and i should note this recent<br>run of wins is more luck than anything<br>my daughter laura is coming to the end<br>of a degree in<br>ecology and conservation and largely<br>online as it is in these days<br>and she's she's not a surfer she's a<br>passionate gardener<br>um this isn't a photograph of her garden<br>i can i can immediately see that because<br>she hasn't quite<br>worked out the skill of growing things<br>in lines her gardening is more patchy<br>but she's an absolute fungus fanatic<br>and at the moment she's spending a lot<br>of time<br>growing a whole range of different<br>and claire is also finishing a degree in<br>in history<br>at the university of east anglia and<br>that's great actually because it means<br>my days in auckland where i<br>discuss the merits of eating kiwi fruits<br>or kumara or<br>milk or meat are are sandwiched between<br>discussions of<br>african american internationalism<br>and the history of art deco<br>architecture those things of which<br>claire is very passionate about<br>but probably not as passionate as she is<br>about german shepherd dogs and that's<br>something that i'm<br>still working on but i'm getting this<br>slowly and and indeed<br>this particular dog will focus a little<br>bit later on in this talk<br>because that dog is all part of my<br>journey to new zealand<br>and before i also before i start i'd<br>like to say a big welcome<br>to other members of my family who i<br>think are zooming in from the uk despite<br>it being rather early in the uk it's<br>about six o'clock in the morning here<br>and one of the ironies of covert<br>is that you know we've all been social<br>distancing<br>and indeed you could say i've taken that<br>somewhat to extremes<br>um but i've talked to many people and<br>it's true in my family as well<br>that our embrace of a number of<br>technologies such as<br>zoom has meant it's brought a number of<br>families together<br>and for that i'm most grateful and here<br>you can see<br>my immediate family and there's my<br>eldest brother if i can get this working<br>eldest brother up there david with his<br>wife sue there's my my brother stephen<br>he's my twin brother with his partner<br>sue<br>um another brother of mine with his<br>partner monique<br>my sister with her partner steve<br>there's claire up there all by herself<br>and of course in the middle there<br>there's my mother<br>a kind of matriarch of the family mother<br>of five<br>grandmother of twelve and great brother<br>grandmother to date of eight<br>or there will shortly be nine and no<br>doubt before long it will be ten<br>so let me let me start and i i i thought<br>i'd give this time this lecture a title<br>it's not something i often do<br>and i thought i'd call it tall nettles<br>now a number of people thought i was<br>alluding to this tall poppy syndrome<br>which is in this part of the world and i<br>have to admit i wasn't quite sure what<br>that was and looked it up<br>and indeed that would have been really<br>clever but i'm afraid that wasn't the<br>case<br>and the tall nettles is name of a<br>favorite poem of mine<br>um and it's been a favorite pair of mine<br>since i was in my teenage years<br>and like all great works of literature<br>it can work at different levels at one<br>level it's a<br>rather pleasant little poem about an<br>overgrown farmyard<br>and at another level it says something<br>very profound about who we are<br>and where we're going at least it does<br>to me and i'll end<br>this this lecture today by sharing that<br>poem with you<br>and you can see what it says to you now<br>that poem was written by a poet called<br>edward thomas<br>um and he wasn't he he was mainly a<br>a book reviewer but he wrote poetry just<br>for two years<br>before he died at the battle of aris<br>in france in 1917 at the age of 39<br>and his great friend was robert frost<br>now robert frost of course wrote the<br>poem the road<br>not taken and some people say that's the<br>most famous poem in the world indeed it<br>was used in new zealand some years ago<br>to sell ford motor cars<br>um and that that poem<br>alludes to the different paths one may<br>take in one's life<br>do you go this way or do you go that way<br>and what that poem says if you go that<br>way despite what you might think you can<br>never go back<br>and that seems to be a good<br>poem to use an occasion like this<br>because any academic career and even<br>maybe any career is all about making<br>those choices<br>and as i tell you my academic journey<br>you'll see that along that route i had a<br>number of choices to take<br>but i like tall nettles<br>and one reason i like tall nettles is<br>that it speaks to me<br>of the countryside of southern england<br>where i spent much of my formative years<br>years of my adolescence amongst the the<br>hazel coppers<br>with its carpet of ramsens and the<br>bluebell<br>are the beechwoods with its slaves of<br>bluebells and it was kind of here that<br>this academic<br>journey starts i'm going to tell you<br>about and i<br>i went to a fairly traditional boys<br>school with with my brother stephen<br>where not only we did science but we did<br>latin<br>and we did shakespeare so i set myself a<br>little task of getting a little bit of<br>latin and shakespeare into this lecture<br>just to demonstrate to you what a<br>and and i left here to go to university<br>and i suppose<br>in retrospect against the expectation of<br>some of my<br>teachers who thought i'd go off and do<br>something like medicine or something<br>i chose to go to university in north<br>wales to study marine biology<br>um and at that time i was very<br>interested in farming seaweeds<br>farming seaweeds and eating seaweeds and<br>i thought this would solve<br>many of the impending problems of the<br>world<br>and i may still feel that and it's quite<br>ironic that here at the<br>at a later stage in my career i find<br>myself engaged in this kind of research<br>but i went to university there but i<br>didn't actually stay studying seaweeds<br>very long i'm afraid<br>i think it was a matter of weeks or<br>possibly even days<br>and i got rather more enamored with<br>theoretical ecology population biology<br>and mathematical modelling<br>and i taught myself to code and i began<br>making mathematical models um predator<br>prey interactions which are quite fun<br>and i seem to be able to<br>reinvent for myself some of the<br>theoretical models that other people had<br>done<br>and as my models became more complex<br>they became more chaotic and this indeed<br>was quite fashionable at the time and<br>intuitively<br>we feel that as ecological communities<br>become more complex they become more<br>stable<br>but actually if you do modeling they<br>become more chaotic<br>and this was quite interesting to me and<br>i had a great opportunity it was a great<br>university<br>in my my third years undergraduate to do<br>my first<br>real research experiment and<br>that experiment involves growing a big<br>flat area of this plant lapsana communis<br>it's a kind of a weedy plant but it has<br>found its way to new zealand and the<br>little photograph<br>the bottom was a a picture i took of it<br>at cox's reserve<br>or one of my lockdown walks a few weeks<br>ago<br>and i i grew this really flat beautiful<br>lawn of this plant<br>and then one night catastrophe struck<br>there was a kind of leak in the roof of<br>the glass house and i came in the<br>morning and it was all patchy<br>hopeless disaster and i took<br>two things from that which i think has<br>stayed with me<br>throughout my research career and<br>possibly throughout my life<br>and the first was that stuff happens<br>and indeed it really has happened in the<br>last couple of years<br>but secondly you need to make the best<br>of it you need to make the best of it<br>and i think i did make the best of it i<br>published my very first academic<br>published paper from that study<br>back in 1984 leading to an eight injects<br>to 57<br>not 46. and<br>it was it was great and but i took<br>something else from that as well in that<br>while i could<br>model chaos you can't model catastrophe<br>and indeed it seems a bit of a modeling<br>catastrophe seems a bit of an oxymoron<br>to me<br>and so instead of going off to do a phd<br>in theoretical ecology<br>or or such like thing and i was engaged<br>with robert may at that point at oxford<br>i took myself off to work on some farms<br>which was probably a fairly sensible<br>thing to do<br>and then i borrowed some money from my<br>mother<br>and i took myself off to africa and i<br>spent<br>the best part of about eight months<br>traveling in in southern africa i did a<br>and it was a great time not time to tell<br>you about that unfortunately today<br>um i haven't forgotten by your way mum<br>if you're listening i still owe you a<br>little bit of money<br>um i'll go on to that<br>and i came back from africa after a year<br>and i started to do a phd at the<br>university of east anglia<br>in a solid kind of subject plant<br>pathology<br>and again i actually had some interest<br>in fungus as well<br>and this was great and i met<br>i i got on really well with my<br>supervisor dr brian lewis and i'm still<br>in touch with him i saw him a year ago<br>great guy i really made really good<br>friends there with the other people in<br>in the lab at the same time philip and<br>fiona<br>and martin and then his partner helen<br>and they are still my very good friends<br>and i think that's often the people you<br>meet doing a phd you stay with them<br>but there was a slight issue in that i<br>don't think<br>i was as engaged in that phd research<br>as maybe i could have been and certainly<br>not as engaged as i like my students to<br>be<br>and i found out through<br>writing letters this was the days before<br>email<br>days before the world wide web not sure<br>there was a fax machine in the<br>department at that time or not<br>that there was an international program<br>to collect and conserve<br>wild brassica species which grew on the<br>cliffs<br>around the mediterranean and i thought<br>oh this sounds great actually<br>so i i wrote letters and eventually they<br>wrote back and they said yes<br>you're welcome to come along but you<br>need to pay your way<br>now of course this was a bit of an issue<br>i was already in debt<br>um and before i come on to that i just<br>need to<br>a little diverse tell you a little bit<br>about the university<br>and where it is in england on the<br>norwich research park and this is the<br>norwich research park<br>it's a very big concentration of life<br>science institutes the university sits<br>back there<br>now whether the university is part of<br>the norris research park or adjacent to<br>the<br>nordic research park has uh is a fact<br>that many<br>vice chancellors pro vice chancellors<br>directors spend hours and hours<br>discussing<br>um i it doesn't really matter to me and<br>i was actually going to<br>spend a large part of my research career<br>i didn't know at that time<br>at this research park firstly at uea<br>more lately at the john innes center<br>then at the institute of food research<br>and then at the quadrum institute<br>and during that time i formed very<br>strong collaborations<br>with the genome center and the<br>university hospital and i'll come on all<br>to that<br>presently but the point of this little<br>divergence here is to tell you that in<br>the 1980s the director of the jonas<br>was professor howard woolhouse now you<br>need to think of how will house is a<br>kind of frank bloomfield kind of figure<br>he's a director very important person<br>and even at that age i knew what<br>directors did<br>and they sat behind big desks in very<br>nice offices and<br>frank's got the windows and in those big<br>desks they have big drawers in those<br>drawers they have bags full of money<br>and that's what directors are about and<br>so as a first-year phd student i went<br>over and i<br>i i just wandered into harold<br>woolhouse's office you could do that in<br>these days<br>in those days and these days you'd<br>probably have to make an appointment<br>three months in advance<br>and be security vetted but i just wanted<br>in i<br>explained to professor howell woolhouse<br>i was a first-year phd student and<br>could i have some money please to go<br>collecting plants on the cliffs<br>of italy and he said yes<br>and then his next question was how much<br>do you want but i hadn't really got that<br>far of thinking that<br>and i asked for some pitiful small<br>amount<br>which he readily agreed to and it was<br>actually the the i was asked that<br>question<br>another time in my research career and i<br>was equally unprepared for that that<br>question<br>and then just as i was about to go<br>bring me back some seeds of this plant<br>mauricandia are vensus<br>and i said professor woolhouse nothing<br>will give me greater pleasure<br>but of course i'd never ever heard of<br>this plant i had no idea where it grew<br>or anything about it but i readily<br>agreed to do that<br>and so a few weeks later<br>i found myself sitting on the seawall in<br>barrie<br>in southern italy and now i'm at the end<br>there<br>in the company of three very important<br>professors<br>there's professor petro perini from<br>italy forget this to work here<br>professor mats gustafsson from sweden<br>and professor gomez cesar campo<br>from spain and we had a wonderful time<br>and my goodness how kind they were to me<br>and we went collecting down the amalfi<br>coast now this is a<br>a nice picture it's rather untypical<br>because it's a bit of an typical habitat<br>the habitat for these plants<br>were more like this on these cliff faces<br>and if you can see just down there<br>there's some flowering wild brassica<br>and a lot of this time involved climbing<br>up and down these cliffs<br>i only fell off once but it was quite a<br>long form<br>but of course we weren't collecting<br>flowers we were collecting seeds like<br>this and we collected<br>from down this bit of coast here the<br>amalfi coast onto iskia<br>and capri and then around sicily<br>and one of the plants that i collected<br>right back in the early 80s was this one<br>brassica veloso from sicily<br>and i'm still working on that plant now<br>now when i i<br>i have a habit and this is i i<br>rather indulge in this in new zealand as<br>well about when i'm walking around i<br>tend to<br>taste the plants i'm seeing nibble at<br>them and presumably at some point this<br>will poison me<br>and i tasted these brassica plants as i<br>went around<br>and it was really interesting because<br>many of them had quite a hot taste<br>and this is because when i bit into them<br>i was causing a chemical reaction<br>of this compound here and it was<br>cleaving here by enzyme and leaving<br>releasing a muscle knife and you're<br>familiar with these compounds<br>because if you eat sushi and put a<br>little bit of wasabi on it<br>this is what you're tasting and if you<br>eat things like watercress<br>that's what you take never hot taste and<br>they have hot taste<br>because that compound stimulates in your<br>mouth<br>your trv p1 receptor which is a receptor<br>which senses temperature<br>and it's quite interesting that these<br>plant chemicals interact with the<br>receptor and they taste hot<br>and it was interesting because they<br>didn't all taste the same<br>some of them tasted very hot some of<br>them were quite mild<br>and then as the weeks went on i realized<br>that they were much more subtle<br>changes and over the years<br>i realized that these subtle changes<br>were due to chemical changes in this<br>side chain here<br>rather subtle changes but have an<br>influence on flavor<br>and that's a difference between if you<br>eat bok choy<br>or watercress or broccoli they all taste<br>a little bit different<br>and again at that time i didn't know<br>that i was going to spend<br>much of my career working these<br>chemicals however<br>i went back to norwich i did my phd<br>in this area began thinking a little bit<br>about how you could use plant genetics<br>to explore biochemistry<br>but out of the blue when i finished my<br>phd i was offered a position in africa<br>my goodness so and what was this about<br>and this came out of the blue this job<br>really and it was with an international<br>organization<br>one of the cgi centers at that time it<br>was called the international board for<br>plant genetic resources<br>it's now called biodiversity and this<br>was about<br>cowpeas or black-eyed beans and you may<br>be familiar with these you can buy them<br>in<br>in shops in in new zealand with a very<br>important subsistence crop in in africa<br>and they suffer from a lot of problems<br>pest diseases and the nutritional<br>profile isn't what it may be<br>and so there's a lot of interest in<br>collecting the wild relatives of these<br>to be using breeding programs and i<br>suppose even at that young age i had a<br>bit of experience of africa<br>a bit of experience of plant collecting<br>two kind of came together a little bit<br>and but before i was offered that post<br>there had been<br>quite a big program a kind of three-year<br>program<br>which had really looked through tens of<br>thousands<br>of herbarium specimens in places like q<br>and this is the queue herbarium<br>and it's an absolute wonderful place to<br>spend time if you look<br>through those cupboards you find<br>specimens collected not just by banks<br>but by<br>people like darwin and such like and<br>it's it's absolutely fantastic<br>and that long study not just at queue<br>but in missouri berlin paris<br>had clearly shown that the wild<br>relatives<br>of the cowpea were not to be found in<br>west africa or this east africa which is<br>what the<br>the the book said were actually<br>in southern africa and so<br>after a few weeks in rome<br>i found myself<br>in zimbabwe jointly working jointly<br>between the national herbarium and<br>botanic gardens<br>and the university of zimbabwe with<br>quite a big budget<br>and my task was to work with national<br>programs in in<br>in those southern african countries to<br>collect and conserve<br>the wild relatives of of calpe<br>now i've mentioned already harold<br>wallhaus who's been quite influential in<br>my career and and i'd like to mention a<br>few other people's go along<br>and one of them is bob drummond he was a<br>keeper of the herbarium<br>a man who really gave me a huge amount<br>of help<br>he was also i should say a man of<br>certain eccentricities he had a great<br>passion<br>for his science and he's he's passed<br>away now<br>and um sorely missed by many<br>now let me tell you a little bit about<br>africa<br>at this time and again you need to think<br>this is in the<br>late 1980s there was<br>an apartheid regime in south africa<br>which meant that officially i couldn't<br>go to south africa<br>but for practical reasons i had to a<br>couple of times and i i<br>was fortunate to be able to travel on a<br>second passport<br>and one of the reasons was to collect a<br>land rover which had been imported into<br>durban as a driver back to zimbabwe<br>and that was quite an experience<br>anything had driven up to that time was<br>a was a<br>rather falling apart two cv<br>but anyway and then also<br>there was a rather nasty civil war going<br>on in mozambique<br>and in ongo and angola and namibia was<br>largely out of bounds as well<br>because of south africa fighting their<br>war from their borders but the countries<br>of botswana zimbabwe zambia and malawi<br>were peaceful and at that time zimbabwe<br>was a wonderful place to live it had a<br>booming economy<br>there was a policy of reconciliation<br>it was a wonderful place and i i very<br>much valued my time there<br>let me tell you a little bit about what<br>i was doing and the places i went and<br>then i'll<br>share with you three short anecdotes<br>i only went to mozambique once<br>and i remember flying from zimbabwe very<br>high over the country fly<br>very high so you don't get shot down<br>and then over maputo the plane spiraled<br>down and down and down almost<br>seemingly forever and in maputo kind of<br>wore torn the pluto<br>which was right down here i met up with<br>some amazing students from the<br>university and academics from the<br>university<br>who despite the war were continuing<br>their academic<br>endeavors and we went and<br>collected plants and other biological<br>specimens on offshore islands<br>in the indian ocean including vigna<br>marina which was the vigna species i was<br>after<br>which grew on those sands and that was<br>an amazing experience<br>i spent quite a long time or many visits<br>to the eastern highlands<br>of zimbabwe and here um<br>here's a chimani many mountains and the<br>chimani mani mountains are here on the<br>border of mozambique<br>and they are very beautiful and you<br>spend a day driving down from harare<br>and the mountains face west and have a<br>lot of quartzite in so they kind of<br>shimmer in the evening sun<br>and the day climbing up those mountains<br>and on top there's big grassy plateaus<br>and there we were collecting while i was<br>collecting a very rare species of<br>ignovasa<br>which we found several times<br>going further north to zambia<br>with these great expanses of beyond<br>woodland and<br>i spent some time up in the copper belt<br>here trying to get the more tropical<br>species was actually a pretty difficult<br>place to be<br>the price of copper had fallen a lot<br>over the previous 20 years<br>and so is a very run-down area<br>um but here this is the bridge over the<br>langa river<br>um on the way to malawi and i have very<br>fond memories of coming up to that<br>bridge<br>and as was typical of that time there<br>are roadblocks<br>and young teenage soldiers with ak-47s<br>in one hand<br>and the beers in the other hand and you<br>always feel a bit anxious in those<br>situations<br>as you would and i remember that within<br>10-15 minutes<br>really chatting about manchester united<br>and football<br>a subject of which i have relatively<br>little interest<br>but a subject you should always know a<br>little bit about<br>because it can get you out of any kind<br>of situation maybe not in new zealand<br>though which<br>doesn't seem to work in this country<br>but anyway from zambia you go on to<br>malawi<br>and i had a wonderful long time in<br>malawi<br>collecting plants right from the<br>mountains in the south mount melanie<br>mount zomba<br>including a time i got i got very ill<br>actually with amoebic dysentery in zomba<br>and then collecting right the way up the<br>shores of lake malawi to the tanzania<br>border<br>collecting a species called vigna<br>luteola<br>and another legume called sophocarpus<br>lunatis<br>and i remember in particular a wonderful<br>christmas i spent without<br>my national counterparts upon the anika<br>plateau<br>very special place and then back<br>to zimbabwe this is zambezi valley the<br>rift valley<br>very low lying very hot not actually<br>very good for plant collecting not the<br>plants i wanted but very good for<br>large wild animals and i spent quite a<br>bit of time down there i was fortunate<br>to do some teaching<br>on some camps for kids from rather<br>deprived schools<br>and had the opportunity to see lots of<br>the many close encounters with the<br>the large wildlife africa including<br>elephants and lions and<br>hippopotamuses and rhinos and such like<br>uh wild dogs<br>and in particular one very close<br>encounter with a leopard<br>which i can tell you about later if you<br>wish<br>and then the okavango that great<br>fantastic inland delta<br>in northwest botswana um<br>and just an amazing place i i think i i<br>regret<br>not going right into deep into the delta<br>it was difficult to justify that from<br>work but i certainly<br>collected on the fringes of that but my<br>very favorite place<br>was undoubtedly the kalahari desert and<br>i was fortunate enough to do<br>a number of collecting trips through the<br>kalahari<br>and i'll tell you about one of them<br>shortly and so before i move on i'll<br>tell you three<br>short anecdotes<br>um two of which may be slightly<br>um amusing this is mountain yanga<br>this is in the eastern highlands of<br>zimbabwe slightly north of the chimani<br>mountains<br>and this is a sacred mountain of the<br>shona people who live in this part of<br>the world<br>and is a place to be treated with<br>considerable respect<br>and it was on the slopes of this<br>mountain i found a a<br>a totally new species a new species<br>within the genus i was working on wigner<br>and so i had the opportunity to describe<br>and name the species and i called it<br>wigner<br>in yangensis the wigner of inyanga<br>in respect for this place<br>and here finally i understood<br>why i did schoolboy latin because it<br>allowed me to<br>do that latin description which i very<br>much enjoyed and i would also<br>just show that these lovely line<br>drawings<br>of vigne and yangenses were done by my<br>friend and<br>companion for some of these germans<br>journeys helen<br>who was very talented artist and<br>would go on later to be the mother of my<br>children<br>the most amazing collecting trip i went<br>on though was um<br>in to the kalahari and this year<br>we'd had there had been more rain than<br>in the previous 80 years<br>and we left harare<br>pouring with rain and we drove on the<br>in haberoni we met our local counterpart<br>a very talented<br>bosnia called ellen clarkey ellen was<br>great she was later to die in a car<br>accident<br>and almost as we drove into haberoni the<br>sun came out<br>and within a week we set off across the<br>desert and it was really like a david<br>attenborough<br>documentary you know the desert just<br>bloomed around us<br>and we went right across the central<br>kalahari<br>over to the yokovanga delta and then<br>down the<br>the border with namibia across its very<br>dry air of the kalahari<br>down to this african border and back and<br>it took several weeks and it was the<br>most extraordinary<br>um collecting trip and bob drummond paid<br>me<br>i think probably one of my greatest<br>compliments by saying it was the<br>second best plant collection trip he'd<br>ever been on<br>and his best collecting was uh in<br>right back in the 1950s in east africa<br>one of the interesting plants we<br>collected on this trip<br>was a wild form of cowpea right from the<br>very driest parts and<br>i was particularly pleased with this<br>because i'd seen herbarium specimens<br>collected<br>over 100 years ago in queue<br>and everybody was rather doubtful would<br>find these but we found them in<br>abundance<br>and again we described these not as a<br>new species but as a new subspecies<br>and this was particularly interesting<br>now<br>i did probably have one of my<br>most remarkable experiences of my life<br>right in the middle of the kalahari and<br>i'll tell you about this it's not it<br>hasn't doesn't have a big science<br>content but it may<br>amuse you at night we would sleep around<br>a campfire<br>and look at that amazing southern sky at<br>night<br>and indeed someone asked me the other<br>day why did you come to new zealand and<br>i said<br>i needed to see the night sky from the<br>southern hemisphere once again<br>i've done that actually i've ticked that<br>one off but<br>we were sleeping outside and i think<br>everybody was sleeping in tents apart<br>from myself i was sleeping on a<br>stretcher<br>a camp bed around a fire and<br>i woke up in the middle of the night and<br>i felt this just<br>huge weight sitting on my chest and i<br>mean<br>really heavy i couldn't talk and i<br>couldn't move<br>and of course this is a what's called a<br>sleep paralysis it's the only time my<br>life has affected me<br>and i was really there and i remember<br>lying there going<br>trying to get this off me and in my head<br>i<br>i knew that a great big snake<br>had not only curled up and sitting on my<br>chest but had bitten me<br>and i was going to die and i really<br>thought that very much and i remember<br>lying there<br>thinking and looking at the sky of<br>course i didn't<br>i woke up in the morning and i i<br>i said to one of my companions i said i<br>said did you hear me call out in the<br>night they said oh yeah i think i did<br>hear you call out<br>i didn't come out to see what was wrong<br>and anyway it was it's quite interesting<br>and it kind of<br>made me quite interested in this and of<br>course<br>in all cultures you have<br>these stories and in the northern<br>hemisphere<br>you have the mayor this<br>it's called in this this malicious<br>entity i don't know how malicious they<br>are but they come and sit on your chest<br>at night weigh you down<br>and of course this is the origin of the<br>word nightmare<br>now some weeks after once i talked to<br>this boyfriend they said well<br>that's a witch that's what witches do<br>they sit on you at night<br>and so i had this witch sitting on me in<br>the middle of the kalahari desert but<br>there is a difference in the northern<br>hemisphere<br>which is flying broomsticks and in<br>africa they ride on the backs of hyenas<br>and there were certainly lots of hyenas<br>around at that time<br>now so that was quite a interesting<br>experience one that i haven't forgotten<br>and nor the next room because excitement<br>doesn't didn't only happen<br>in the desert it can happen in the<br>suburbs<br>so let's go back to harare before i move<br>on and<br>put some science into this talk uh his<br>ferrari<br>look there's the botanic gardens and<br>there's the university oh look there's<br>avondale i used to live in avondale<br>it's a bit like auckland isn't it and<br>indeed the architecture of ferrari is<br>very similar to auckland the downtown<br>architecture the suburbs it's very<br>similar<br>and when i first came to auckland i was<br>rather taken by this<br>there are some differences of course in<br>the 1980s harare had a<br>ring of of of um<br>of roadblocks around the city<br>and if you wanted to go out of the city<br>you'd have to talk to the army of the<br>police to explain what you're doing<br>you can't imagine that would happen in<br>now when i when i was wasn't driving my<br>kind of macho land rover around africa<br>which i<br>rather enjoyed and i must say i thought<br>i was rather good at<br>i rode a rather an old bicycle<br>and i often used to ride from where i<br>lived in<br>in avondale down through<br>across this what's called this flay in<br>in in<br>auckland you might call it a reserve or<br>a domain or something it was a fairly<br>big land a bit wet a bit muddy and it's<br>a cycle my bicycle across there<br>and one day i was cycling across there<br>and wow<br>i saw this this species of plant i'd<br>been looking for for a couple of years<br>by this time victor monofiller<br>and it grew just a few hundred meters<br>when i was living and i never saw this<br>species again<br>a fairly wide threes in south africa but<br>very rare<br>i thought this is fantastic so i i made<br>a note and i went to the bavarian and i<br>came back and<br>i i brought a map with me and you had<br>very good maps of zimbabwe they were<br>paid for by the scandinavian aid<br>agencies and i<br>very carefully oh oh i should say the<br>plant was in flower<br>which there's lovely flowers on but<br>actually what i wanted was seed<br>and so i thought i have to come back in<br>about three weeks time<br>and so i very carefully marked on on<br>this map<br>some crosses exactly where this plant<br>grew so i'd know where to come back from<br>because<br>by that time i learned that your memory<br>isn't good enough<br>now what happens in the next week<br>is that there was a bomb<br>and actually one of the houses fairly<br>near where i lived was blown up<br>and of course this is the in the time of<br>apartheid<br>and some south african insurgents had<br>come up to harare<br>they had positioned a mortar and that<br>fired that mortar and they blew up this<br>house which was a<br>anc house the anc of course were<br>fighting the freeman freedom struggle<br>in south africa fortunately nobody<br>nobody was hurt in this<br>and you know these things happen now and<br>then it wasn't that infrequent i think<br>while i was there there was probably<br>half a dozen explosions over a period of<br>a few years but anyway so i didn't think<br>much about it but i went back to<br>collect my seeds<br>and as soon as i got to the place i was<br>immediately surrounded by armies<br>pointing guns at me and police and i was<br>arrested<br>because where i put my cross was almost<br>the exact place<br>that this mortar had been positioned<br>which blew up the house<br>and um actually i was at um mission bay<br>the other day<br>talking to ramyo and farhad they said<br>what's the scariest thing you've ever<br>done<br>they've been boasting about their bungee<br>jumping which is something i couldn't do<br>and and i thought well i don't know if i<br>did this but it was a scary moment<br>because i did<br>did go through my head i might spend the<br>next 30 years in zimbabwe prison but<br>anyway i did get out of that one<br>but it did actually cast a shadow of the<br>rest of my time there because i was<br>followed quite a lot since that time<br>and i remember one particular scary time<br>of going to my office at university and<br>finding a little<br>handwritten paper note on my desk saying<br>we are watching you<br>and i have that note now you may be<br>getting the impression at this time in<br>my talk that<br>africa was full of experiences but maybe<br>not much science<br>and i was kind of drifting around africa<br>a bit like a victorian<br>plant collector while the kind of<br>engines of molecular biology were being<br>stoked up<br>and i was a little bit concerned i was<br>missing out so i thought after a time it<br>was best to head back<br>i head back and fortunately<br>professor wolhaus offered me a position<br>as a<br>as a research leader at the john innes<br>center<br>it wouldn't happen these days these days<br>you'd probably need three papers in<br>nature<br>and before they even looked at you but<br>anyway uh harold was<br>a great guy um and the journalist was a<br>amazing wonderful place to work now this<br>isn't the current director this is<br>professor william bateson<br>who was the first director and bateson<br>was actually<br>the person who first coined the word<br>genetics<br>and there's a and what you can see there<br>is a letter where he says let's call<br>this new science genetics<br>and the journalists has had a<br>history of over 100 years doing<br>fundamental work in genetics<br>they apply it to plant and microbial<br>science but has lots<br>of applications to all areas of human<br>genetics and medicine<br>and it was quite an amazing place to<br>work<br>i stayed there for about 11 years and<br>then as frank said<br>or i was offered the chair of crop<br>science at the university of nottingham<br>and so 20 years ago this month i gave a<br>previous inaugural lecture<br>and nottingham was a great place many of<br>you may have associations with it this<br>is a<br>sutton bonnington and i need to<br>mention um maria maria tracker<br>and i'd been there not so long and there<br>was a knock on my door and there was a<br>student there<br>and maria was doing a masters<br>in plant science and she said oh<br>professor myvin<br>um i i hear you might have a phd<br>position available<br>i said well yeah i said you know i said<br>well let's go and have a chat<br>of a coffee and halfway through this<br>chat she<br>she kind of stopped and she reached<br>across and she said<br>richard because by that time i told her<br>to<br>dispense with the formality she said are<br>you a proper professor<br>and maybe i hadn't fully embraced the<br>kind of university of nottingham<br>professoria to that stage i'm not sure<br>i've ever did really<br>and then the other anecdote about maria<br>is that she started this phd with me<br>cloning a gene in arabidopsis<br>but within i think four or five weeks<br>i was spending most of my time at the<br>queen's medical center<br>in the main part of the city and maria<br>was finding out how to grow kaka-2 cells<br>and that very much marked the transition<br>of my research career from being<br>plant-based to really focusing on human<br>nutrition<br>and after a few years at nottingham we<br>both moved back to<br>norwich where maria now is a research<br>leader in<br>in gut microbiome doing a brilliant<br>absolutely brilliant job i had a very<br>nice<br>zoom call with her last night talking<br>about science<br>and i led three fairly large program<br>grants<br>in food and health and worked<br>increasingly<br>with people at the hospital and here you<br>can see mr robert mills a consultant<br>urologist at the hospital i've<br>worked with him for many years i next to<br>him antonella<br>antonella worked in my research group<br>again for a long time and is now<br>oversees all human studies from the<br>quadrant<br>and tracy livingstone who's one of my<br>current students and tracy is a<br>clinician<br>who's just taken some time out of her<br>training to do an md degree<br>which has been slightly disrupted by<br>covert and we have a<br>an intervention which is just about to<br>finish<br>and as frank said in addition to the<br>science at ifr<br>i was very involved with the transition<br>of the quadrant of the institute of food<br>research to the quadrum institute<br>and this big building and and this<br>building i should note<br>goes quite a long way underground and<br>underground you have the biggest<br>colonoscopy unit in europe<br>and the idea was to try and interface<br>the clinical work<br>with basic research in food and<br>microbiology<br>and i think it's a great infrastructure<br>and hopefully<br>that will come to fruition over the next<br>few years<br>um moving on and so over this period and<br>now i'm spanning actually a long time<br>about 25 years<br>looking back in retrospect i really<br>asked three questions my first question<br>and again this was in the earlier part<br>of my career but it's continued<br>actually today was how do plants make<br>complex metabolites and i was focusing<br>glucosinolates and<br>worked a lot on brassica but also on the<br>model species arabidopsis the kind of<br>drosophila of the plant world<br>and make make models of biochemical<br>pathways as what you did<br>and then a lot of genetic analysis and<br>it's amazing thinking back<br>to those days we didn't have any linkage<br>maps<br>we began mapping mendelian traits qtl<br>and then of course<br>the whole sequencing revolution and the<br>journalists was a great place<br>because they were pioneering genome<br>sequencing of organisms<br>and more more sophisticated models and i<br>just note<br>and then for many people there the<br>genetics was an end in itself<br>but for me it was just a tool because i<br>wanted to use that genetics to really<br>explore<br>two interesting biological questions one<br>was<br>plant herbivore and plant pathogen<br>interactions the second one is human<br>nutrition and<br>indeed these worlds have much to gain<br>from interaction with each other<br>but they actually operate in largely<br>completely separate spheres<br>at the moment um and just briefly the<br>plant herbivore one was really great fun<br>and this was mainly while i was at<br>jonathan<br>and you can see here if you increase<br>the level of these compounds in plants<br>and these are increasing the level<br>you can get less damage by things like<br>slugs<br>and pigeons but you get more damage<br>by these specialized insects they've<br>evolved mechanisms<br>to detoxify or sequester these chemicals<br>just like some of the bugs do in our in<br>our guts<br>and i had a particularly enjoyable time<br>with working on<br>more complex communities and we could<br>we showed that by altering the plant<br>genetics<br>we could attract in a parasitic wasp<br>which would then run around and<br>parasitize<br>aphids on the leaves so that was a great<br>time<br>and then also did some work not in<br>experimental populations but in natural<br>plant communities this is down<br>the south dorset coast and did some<br>interesting kind of<br>ecologies for his population biology it<br>was interesting for me just a few months<br>ago to realize<br>that this work had been picked up in new<br>zealand and the models we developed at<br>that time have been used<br>to look at some population evolutionary<br>ecology<br>of some plants in the southern alps of<br>new zealand which very much uses what we<br>but the main question i then focused on<br>for the last i suppose 50 years what 15<br>years<br>seems like 50 sometimes um was really a<br>it seems like an easy question does<br>broccoli does eating broccoli keep us<br>healthy but it's an amazingly complex<br>question and food interventions are very<br>challenging<br>and this is due to glucoraphanin what<br>drove this work was<br>work that came out from the united<br>states from john hopkins in the early<br>90s<br>and that work said that this compound<br>sulfurophane<br>which is derived from the compound<br>accumulated broccoli and the gut bugs in<br>our gut generate this compound in our<br>gut<br>this is a potent inducer of a<br>transcription factor called<br>nfr2 it does this by inducing oxidative<br>stress<br>if you run around a block you have the<br>same effect and what we need to do is to<br>induce oxidative stress in our system<br>not consume antioxidants<br>and what does nfr mediated transcription<br>do<br>it switches on maybe up to 200 genes<br>in different tissues but mainly hepatic<br>metabolism<br>and these genes are involved in a number<br>of physiological processes which are<br>probably thought to be beneficial and<br>you can see<br>they involve things like phase 2<br>metabolism antioxidant activity<br>and at the same time there's also a lot<br>of epidemiological studies coming out<br>so from the other end and these said<br>that people who had diets<br>rich in cruciferous vegetables such as<br>broccoli were having lower<br>incidence of cancer at different sites<br>and here you can see<br>papers on prostate um gastrointestinal<br>tract and lung<br>and these two things seem to be wow<br>that's interesting you got<br>mechanistic at one level epidemiological<br>so<br>i kind of rather naively set myself the<br>task of seeing if we could<br>address this experimentally i thought<br>well i can i know how to do this<br>because i understand genetics of these<br>and what you need to do<br>is to develop broccoli with higher<br>levels of these and then you can see if<br>you feed people these whether they're<br>better than people at low levels<br>um i you know naivety is sometimes<br>exactly what you need as a scientist and<br>if you don't have that you never do<br>anything<br>so um i used material that collected<br>right back from when<br>i did that collecting when i was a phd<br>student<br>and introduced by conventional genetics<br>but a lot of dna fingerprinting work<br>into a broccoli and you can see by<br>transferring this<br>transcription factor allele called mib<br>28<br>into here you increase the level about<br>threefold<br>and then if you introduce a second copy<br>so you make it homozygous<br>it can go up even higher and i thought<br>this<br>this is this is great this is what how<br>we can do it and<br>as frank said at that time we also<br>worked with<br>company to commercialize its broccoli<br>and it was on sale for<br>quite a few years um the company that's<br>commercialized<br>that then were bought by another company<br>and such like and so we took<br>the intellectual property back<br>and at the moment we're developing that<br>through our own spin out called the<br>smarter food company<br>and that's going very well so what did i<br>do with this broccoli<br>now we did a whole series of human<br>intervention studies and i'm not going<br>to describe these all<br>the first ones we really used<br>broccoli itself and and and the<br>logistics<br>is too complicated really and these were<br>really focused on what would now call<br>kind of metabolic health<br>um and my kind of<br>take home message in looking at all<br>these studies and of course we also did<br>a lot of cell culture studies<br>and a lot of sea horse kind of work<br>and it seems to me that you know if you<br>eat lots of broccoli or such<br>what you're doing is re-tuning your<br>engine and your engine being a<br>mitochondria<br>and i think this is a very good analogy<br>and what it does<br>for those who are interested<br>it really helps fatty acid beta<br>oxidation to be well integrated<br>with a tca cycle and that avoids<br>compounds like acelcarnatines<br>accumulating your plasma and secondly<br>it really leads to citrate going down a<br>catabolic root<br>going around the tca cycle as opposed to<br>being exported<br>into lipid synthesis and retuning the<br>engine is quite a good<br>analogy if you do these studies on<br>fairly young people who engines work<br>very well<br>you see absolutely no effect because if<br>you do them on people such as me who've<br>now been around the block a few times<br>you can then see some improvement in<br>their metabolism<br>but of course you know if if your engine<br>goes wrong<br>it doesn't matter how much broccoli you<br>eat not going to help<br>and of course for all of us at some<br>point our engines will stop working all<br>together<br>and then the other series of studies<br>they did<br>was actually using a suit product and<br>these were really focused<br>on prostate and prostate cancer in men<br>and here again i'd like to just<br>acknowledge two very important people in<br>my career<br>professor colin cooper professor of<br>cancer genetics at the university of<br>anglia<br>very very kind very clever man<br>and also jonathan simons who is a chief<br>executive of the prostate cancer<br>foundation<br>of the united states who was very<br>generous in their funding into my lab<br>over many years and<br>i think they really decided to fund<br>in food and health an area which they<br>never funded before<br>really being focused on drug<br>interventions this last study adapt<br>isn't finished yet that's the one that<br>tracy's working on<br>and i'm not going to tell you much of<br>the science here but just<br>just the brief summary of the escape<br>study and this was<br>this study was meant to take i don't<br>know 18 months<br>and it took i think six years to finish<br>it took an awful long time and this was<br>a study<br>in which recruited men who had early<br>signs of prostate cancer we took biopsy<br>tissue<br>from their prostate we did rna-seq so we<br>sequenced all the genes we looked at<br>their expression<br>then we had them on a diet for a year<br>and then we took other biopsies from<br>them and we looked at what<br>changes were happening in that prostate<br>over that year and you can see the red<br>are the genes which have gone up the<br>blue of the genes have gone down<br>the black of the genes which didn't<br>change and many of these changes<br>were associated with the promotion of<br>oncogenic pathways so these people<br>were at risk of much more serious cancer<br>than they had<br>and we showed that using the<br>high glycemic broccoli we could<br>attenuate<br>some of these changes and in the very<br>high one<br>we could almost reduce them very much<br>and<br>that's work which again we're continuing<br>with<br>and one of my ambitions in new zealand<br>is to undertake a much larger dietary<br>intervention study here<br>with clinical end points which this one<br>didn't have<br>now<br>this is the galloway hills<br>in scotland and<br>some years ago i was on a holiday with<br>claire<br>it was a bit of a challenging holiday<br>we're in a camper van<br>but it was a lovely holiday and at one<br>point we<br>we saw i said look at that claire<br>adventure before dementia i said<br>we better write that down before we<br>claire didn't write it down and she did<br>a little photograph of it<br>and so a couple of years after that i<br>think that's took in our mind that maybe<br>we had one more great adventure in our<br>life to come<br>and so we decided to exchange the<br>ornithological delights of north norfolk<br>and here you can see<br>the thousands of brent geese which are<br>now coming in at this time of year to<br>overwinter<br>on the the marshes there they'll be<br>coming in from svalbard and greenland<br>and scandinavia<br>to the undoubted and remarkable<br>orthodological<br>delights of new zealand<br>and here you can see one of them and<br>indeed this is my shakespeare moment and<br>to paraphrase miranda when she opens her<br>eyes<br>and sees ferdinand for the very first<br>time the first man she's ever seen apart<br>from<br>her father the magician prospero oh<br>brave new world<br>that has such creatures in it and indeed<br>what creatures you do have<br>in new zealand they extend far beyond<br>the kiwi<br>i should note so that's brilliant but<br>there are many delights<br>of coming to university of auckland and<br>the ligands and one of them certainly<br>is working with this group of people<br>joanne elena simone and christine and<br>it's very nice that i can see<br>eleanor and simon here and i think we're<br>a great team<br>i spent half my time working the high<br>valley nutrition<br>national science challenge and i must<br>say i think at the moment we're really<br>motoring<br>and the program is really developing and<br>it's nice to be doing good science<br>but it's also nice to work with such a<br>great group of people<br>and so thank you very much for that and<br>and finally<br>i get to find out a little bit more<br>about seaweed right back<br>so where i started<br>and then also of course i intend to get<br>my own research up and running which i'm<br>now<br>beginning to do and of course i'm very<br>interested in this<br>interface between plant chemistry<br>and human health but maybe not broccoli<br>maybe i've done enough broccoli<br>although we have got some broccoli work<br>going on and you can see here<br>these are the chemicals very similar to<br>broccoli that you get from<br>this is wasabi and also cress and in new<br>zealand you have very interesting<br>lipidium species lipidium or erasium<br>and you'd get these compounds and these<br>compounds again<br>would interact with that tavr p1<br>receptor<br>and induce nfr2 transcription as<br>does capsaicin from chili peppers<br>and then coming to ayotoro new zealand<br>i was particularly intrigued by two of<br>your endemic species<br>pseudo winter colorata horipito here<br>and piper excelsion<br>of course these are tonga they are<br>really important species in maori<br>culture<br>and to be treated with considerable<br>respect<br>and indeed reverence and so it's been<br>great that i've been able to develop<br>such a<br>great collaboration with wakatoo<br>a maori led company full of<br>innovation but a very very values-led<br>company<br>the top of the north island and that's<br>been great and that's allowed us that<br>the ligands to start exploring<br>these plants and what health benefits<br>they may<br>produce and of course i'm fortunate<br>having<br>another such great team to be part of<br>another really great team<br>and here to really um thank<br>and say what a pleasure it is working<br>with mika foster<br>who you heard earlier and you'll hear<br>shortly chris puke<br>farhampton and ramya<br>jakarparesh and it's it's really great<br>and<br>you know i was thinking i had such a<br>great meeting this morning with them<br>just talking about science and stuff and<br>it was it was great<br>and i kind of like to finish now and<br>really saying what a pleasure it is to<br>work with ramya<br>as a phd student just going into a<br>second year<br>and i was thinking actually<br>some weeks ago about one's legacy as an<br>academic scientist<br>i haven't finished yet but i'm i can<br>think about this a little bit and and<br>one's legacy maybe<br>one's papers once published in more or<br>less prestigious journals<br>and maybe more maybe more or less cited<br>one may have an institutional legacy i'm<br>sure frank will leave a legacy<br>of what he's done at liggins<br>and maybe i have a bit of a legacy at<br>the quadrangle institute but i think<br>once greatest legacy and probably one's<br>most important legacy<br>is one's graduate students that pass<br>through your lab<br>and so i want to finish with<br>saying thank you in two ways<br>and to thank all the graduate students<br>i've had<br>over the years and to thank them for<br>their contribution to my academic<br>journey of which i've told you a little<br>bit about<br>but also to thank them very much for the<br>privilege of being part of their journey<br>wherever that journey has taken them so<br>maybe i can just actually thank joel and<br>john<br>and dorothea and ben and karen<br>and michaela and tracy and hugo and<br>claire<br>and robert and omar and danny<br>and ruth and fatma and dash and maria<br>and rakhi and kathy and melanie and<br>golgi<br>and lee and phillip and then claire<br>fanati's peter<br>amy rosie and jack and those few at the<br>end<br>maybe need to just improve their social<br>and with that i'll leave you with tall<br>nettles<br>and you have a short amount of time to<br>you<br>uh<br>well thank you richard for an absolutely<br>wonderful<br>tour de force of the lecture i think<br>everyone would agree<br>taking us through your personal journey<br>as well as an amazing scientific journey<br>i think showing the incredible breadth<br>of work that you've done<br>you never did tell us whether you've got<br>those seeds from monavale or not<br>oh um yes i did i also got the seeds for<br>harold<br>and how<br>good certain professors are and caesar<br>gomez campo<br>when i was collecting we did a 200<br>kilometer detour especially to get those<br>seats<br>that's wonderful just remind everyone<br>that um there are<br>reception upstairs and um finally if you<br>do<br>need to get to see me um it doesn't take<br>three months you just have to get get<br>past kate summers<br>now um i'm just going to try and get<br>mika foster back<br>on to close the day for us i think<br>my burning question richard nick time i<br>see you is uh what was that close<br>encounter with the leopard<br>that sounded pretty intriguing too<br>that was a fascinating talk when richard<br>was preparing this lecture he described<br>it to me as his version of a pepeha<br>so his way of introducing himself and<br>establishing his identity and heritage<br>and those things that are important to<br>him<br>after listening to you talk i think that<br>was a really<br>apt description and what a fascinating<br>journey you've had so far<br>thank you for sharing i look forward to<br>the next installment<br>so now in closing this part of the<br>evening it is tikka<br>or appropriate that we finish with a<br>unuh<br>everybody</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
