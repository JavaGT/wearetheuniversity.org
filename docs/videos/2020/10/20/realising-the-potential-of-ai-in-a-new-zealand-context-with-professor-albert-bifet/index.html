day  get breda and a<br>photo and a coat rack it also so thank<br>you live centers for interaction<br>tanks frans clicks and i that tight to<br>these ideas how like to to talk about<br>realizing the potential about you in the<br>usa line context<br>so iolite<br>morris with sit you  to talk about<br>the potential of new zealand obia<br>leader<br>white rso but then it was ever meant a<br>nice and two pulled on woutera<br>how long you on and I'm going to the game a<br>professor university of cats do<br>you think there will be something he said you and<br>then  a wind  euro-toques my and new<br>soul and camping liter<br>yes hello weekend ride<br>so start are talking ever or lita love<br>myself<br>both my from the opposites site like<br>line from a catalunya and of you that is so<br>we see that also small like barcelona<br>dixit is so  hey guys like hangs then<br>the lion is so<br>city that gas so a size her shadow<br>guest so just look ristic quickly<br>something something of your quick close to 2 wise places<br>like the man who to let want you<br>me sana<br>yes yes how is something  what will you this link<br>anthracite iso farming ipod<br>agricole char is quite import and zoey go<br>much both aller au fil des with whom i<br>already know via san miguel and yes because the<br>thing is that you want all local chiro sar<br>in that willem antonie that were  soldiers<br>that fact the work is therefore two thousand<br>years ago<br>to the painter years in the<br>by an opening or the of the city to<br>enter for all university that is<br>cool university to gea<br>analysis will you fresh time goes<br>smaland are we go this here is to<br>something like that  where are you going  we are talking about donations here<br>below then the university of barcelona<br>and as long as your own group r oh here is going to<br>win oh be interested in<br>in computer science fast when was a<br>teenager<br>ruben ballad i had to fascinates it or<br>ho computer science club gold people and<br>remember that my grandmother  and used to<br>play this game of card was cool brisker<br>and have hummel it is time psycho<br>salon and also has a combination of your<br>program a game for her and her une<br>maladie a teenager eye pro name that is<br>the with karin that was meta nsx he<br>computer that was in the ethical<br>worth is only but he I was at<br>router or do yes after yes was mega pirates<br>xinjiang there then but see that was in<br>did is so yes what do you<br>want because I want<br>so yes I this beautiful stadium in barcelona<br>fast<br>yes and want love computer science but<br>after that ar yes that time<br>demos brilliant student becomes million<br>euro that I communication engineering<br>so then has that it is okay to have an idea<br>co2 that I come once engineering<br>so he goes this I walked there was only one<br>never want year i am become to still<br>so  from my win was the cultures on<br>horseback to cut when ice smoothie there<br>was so this internship but knew<br>yes this is the option of could you when to<br>ask in another side is so<br>English want to win child in you thinks<br>the white horse is so that  you want to be free<br>you squeak' for that but that he was<br>not a good send and in as two engines<br>to get there<br>so you are behind me is what he this is<br>that actually a bhakta<br>then a workout the family business<br>but then it is I  then men who<br>are online yes I was never want<br>he feels so what he god is okay slow<br>good the motive he won the letter i<br>what does that you do one has what I<br>have to do is want here is that<br>computer science and get up  member so<br>you this is what he would then designer duo<br>for hobbit on yes I was win<br>who learn does<br>not allow to go from that we care<br>professor that carnival float something like that<br>walcott on yes he wants you go there<br>know I do it like<br>phd and a  connection plan is in a<br>machine learning for data smart that<br>that man cleaning for wet cinsault<br>may your opinion is basic only a set of<br>tools that allah machinst is fun<br>sorry where do you do that do data swim for<br>minh city new york do you do that who<br>errors malfunction ddt<br>under fly and wish you were very very<br>vision on thames of time memory and also<br>the changes<br>had bent now where he knows  you what if yes<br>to the hague i was working on this the<br>data atmosphere me money calories are he<br>was becomes nobody next to will for fun<br>was corby fml oswin i blow hard to use<br>it and then in a black man and<br>dma software of the various kvk  torah<br>pier and and ah i was again want a house<br>i was and with in that format oekra<br>may day month to work and good does let<br>in one or two this and using was so was<br>with inside in me stripes and then<br>after that even he was  like here<br>I hope so but we would I also already<br>teeth hot or if you try to long hair<br>and then yes I was lucky to camp here<br>on zapier is that student for one month<br>and everything was I want I want<br>sighting<br>and yes kickbike and would  watch out<br>for videos so yes beautiful is also born out<br>with a  strong crypte<br>at this are climene those rings gis easy<br>does not by james holmes and then<br>friends ana yes the sweating that he<br>was you willy willy<br>sing along this is that you were<br>proline so yes of this creates from<br>waikato<br>yes here it is someone becomes  this book<br>this book at mit press<br>it is call machine learning for just<br>like friend le spectacle i samos in a<br>man is sometimes that someone who price is<br>almost as if you are not where you can<br>ah yes behind expand hey how often the<br>barcelona<br>become from that flattens and hd how you in<br>of this we go this that is so for the<br>disco apache samuel is in some sense is<br>like mohammed is less willy for big<br>date for know i wanted large quantities<br>of dating and of that were working with<br>hundreds  of thousands of computers<br>so how your backyard waist<br>yeah yeah how cool would be yeah how hard that<br>man i was a very good place for joy<br>richard intense of data mining machine<br>learning the world tour celebrates it was<br>aviator best place<br>i was january when it belongs  and<br>what do you want happy  place to work<br>so I don't have to go to conch he work for<br>a fun way<br>after<br>that was yes was quite as the screens and<br>for big data is a new admit<br>disco bar<br>that was eg popular and then who started<br>this project that was colistine yes so yes<br>after  two years in progress and it is he<br>this to go back to the weather on and then now<br>member this cool out that was that a<br>word what and home to send<br>so yes I was lucky enough to go back<br>there next to her was a professor<br>fast so  that was my trip was that<br>possibly shilling of a was a with<br>your bank dennisa<br>as a professor ditch yeah<br>daryl's o'er doorman walking of<br>streaming and then how to iphone<br>weekend work at popular and then there<br>who starter who is so for the  disco like<br>i have to i will that once<br>in fact der yes i was the save of this<br>group<br>that number is it a grave thick to that<br>farmer was like a<br>very worksite tincture to be working man<br>because this topic so yes okay so<br>why a game  by universiti often adam<br>yes for more bea professor at you<br>see here or I as willie  5 quiet<br>is in this machine learning university<br>of a gift is one of the best when i<br>was it is in the will the calling a<br>professor here is willie hagenaar<br>ana yes this is why he was my work<br>site the type of baking and general all her the<br>your version that is work order forward is<br>already for weeks<br>an advantage is there book is that the mining<br>book this is to block day avenue sense in<br>manager who became it is a round want<br>a wk go narrow and then less download<br>more my child as and citations  of<br>these will really quite popular or<br>undergo a new look at the bar how<br>important that is on the researchers at this<br>university when in neck remia<br>becomes middle east side my counter<br>citations<br>if we this ring popularity and now<br>i want adam mostra site and most popular<br>research that this university diana or<br>from a<br>girl succeeds environment is in the machine<br>and your gave a jan piet and margot<br>he of question and jeff ground we<br>experiences to your look den that clara in<br>by side bank also wants to drink once<br>where I shampoo  the computer science de<br>parme<br>he is the best in filling in so it in<br>this is really be<br>importen  so what is my mission to be so at<br>hard to define my michonne eye glasses<br>nlnet to that part one is ah i want to<br>experience it in that for everyone<br>he would rather live in that for helping<br>a fight store in budget<br>if so this is are strong wil  first a<br>this is my time bidding that chair project<br>for snake is cool interior<br>university waldheim analytical for<br>big data ana yes series in which you<br>interstate tons of gold worbla you<br>machine learning york and in 6 jan big<br>budget benefit this project is for you<br>so the ming  goal of this project is how<br>you can make money more translations in soul<br>and toe I want to benefit from<br>a yes you data science machine learning<br>big day that was so in your interest<br>retra in this trap I see how you work<br>in tour by habil<br>and so  you this another question that is<br>willie more than i come in this crazy<br>disco weekend even walk<br>better just like frame machine learning<br>tank nothing okay and if both you seem yoga<br>often<br>excellent team so ha ah i dare ms<br>research<br>senior research fellow if you sure<br>mandela's research fellow at adecco<br>researchers at the or the project week<br>apples  associates researchers at almost<br>[ __ ] k what resident frank end comes<br>to us if so who who is yes us well I<br>am import then especially to go often are<br>it my buraya<br>and rector or we the full with him<br>partnerships and<br>and islamic as project manager<br>to work  to percent is that is of your<br>project is in school then again full thing<br>that that science artificial intelligent<br>of a ballpoint pen I why in talent<br>women this is a a project that is fresh<br>of this for voting here's a 15-minute<br>this project  the university in your<br>company because here on this brave she<br>blew universiti or also small and there<br>where you on abkm is there is so<br>lady on this project i is a wc khalid<br>howie channel help that madame in language<br>scientif to use marshall and you  so the<br>myngle sar first to go double new<br>technique for machine learning for<br>you said come when chair prolyte then<br>open source big data platform<br>you can of experiments there<br>and finally to grow capability to the<br>same i just so this is a project that<br>contains a<br>de  combination of that he was the first in<br>my  name and languages<br>salient first<br>patty student pencil so interiors and<br>we remember be working on many many die<br>fintouch of<br>in but mentally that is the tango in to<br>be working with images who the detail<br>of sensors and many many different eyes<br>off of dating<br>yes and then  this is a project that is this<br>mamie and professor is can bring<br>why it is then as engineer<br>jeff frown then of go in but he<br>okay so yes well we sew or settings<br>little bit of my life story you because my<br>michel he wants oak nature  so you can not or<br>that is also something so<br>he is something that is going to change<br>drinks coffee<br>about a symbol that I although the google<br>geo-ict data<br>itv are t licenses no to be as<br>import to her father hear and it is it<br>is  so<br>and crime we expect in that and fitting is<br>so we are going to bring someone you that in the future<br>will be living in the<br>smartphones that<br>editing is my tv my ads by this<br>thalys and to<br>devices and we want to go to work  within<br>a driving cars and that now you call<br>loan in smart cities where<br>direction is you are again  optimal parking<br>energy transport<br>even think it's going to be using item x<br>2 tulip that me scale howie lift or something<br>ah<br>became a to be a bit too hot pie lord of<br>person a big room and they showed their<br>time and this is something like a<br>marketing  is think to use all is in<br>trial hall<br>our staff experience when buying<br>links and or so will find disc<br>whiteboard and her name was or health<br>care is no then got then is my two<br>a trial and is been to benefit from all<br>of this technology send your  provider with<br>so yes now you keep define a yes something like that yes<br>to show data get it efficiently ipad is<br>who can someone my popular at google<br>translate<br>week and caesar against be coming willy<br>more popular and computer science and in<br>some centric and caesar  there tv will be<br>intelligent is with that offer<br>some people call computer science to<br>body lotion of computer science and you<br>can see that in many many university<br>in my ionization because in many countries<br>like us china that have you guys<br>investing had to this technology so is<br>is so i  like this definition of the<br>european commission so that's you<br>basic but they want like it's okay<br>that's you  is a combination of data<br>half an hour in a computer will power ever<br>the politicians<br>glenn is wine to go foreigners<br>are to becomes<br>and you can do what you can do something<br>basic alia combine or data algorithms<br>and computing' power so lessons start<br>just like that<br>as  you well there is a rating huge<br>amount of data and who have you minute something<br>want once in data via connect<br>counter internet who is in the social<br>network of our<br>staff communications business<br>communications will i be creating and<br>like a lot of updating<br>ana and  you it is moment is willie b<br>sunday is lily busy<br>using data to be able to make decisions<br>know only but it is want i you<br>busy better or this is why<br>that that you social import<br>so about something if yes then more lime a<br>little bit about  how we do you now we<br>go the data<br>me now let's say how we can do girl<br>online ego cando<br>both android to try to do or five<br>minutes churn glozell machine learning<br>authority<br>with god is what so yes it is to to start<br>I my sentence days  gave campaign website<br>and johan people and her coming to your<br>ride on you want to the side of your<br>interpre  did<br>you want to for cash flow and new<br>lizzie door is meant to be a custom game<br>to click your art and your winterset in<br>implodes in that then just as high and<br>yes that a challenging so<br>I want you get a person a  user<br>an expert user i to a c<br>can explain how should be able to<br>predict database again experience<br>if so what they out basic a this is my to<br>use the dah dah dah dah dah dah give in<br>the own recording memorial and is my<br>to use this  to make production and so<br>so<br>me see that your couple of days data we are<br>going again premios customize visitors<br>that were customers and that customers<br>and then for this experience is expo<br>user guide to be able to make a<br>predictions all of the future<br>so in iping  is that these machine learning<br>methods and do sim harting what i can<br>learn to the data and they can make a<br>product it is so god is it becomes such a<br>let that they that there we have disney<br>who is there now who won to the site<br>because your  predictive this is winter via<br>customer<br>so keep weekend through yes super already<br>once such a  bring color to mention some of<br>the most<br>classical with the so special is cool<br>but you guys t was that barry people so<br>becomes means is week count<br>how many who they of many customers<br>become only could one in new customers and<br>then meant major idea came now<br>principles  in this case mission data<br>we have worn on customers and customers<br>so busy all your good product<br>okay well<br>with what is that is now what we are going to<br>do would we can use a a<br>only yes classifiers this I can again<br>online and are in one part of the line<br>to be the customers and what is in the<br>other one is giving support to join this<br>case is in tibia<br>a customer this is if there is at my<br>brushes fire we gave narbonne that is<br>collin first to warsaw is  is we<br>see what we do is that we look at the<br>new rest<br>no woods the risks hardware<br>the first was a then you look at<br>ideas were customers and customize<br>amphitec this mind your the t.amp in this<br>case who so that not who site of  opinion<br>girl to your site have use free zoo<br>look at the free and then<br>who who is that data oh no  hear heavy<br>custom and school we have we a to<br>bridge I that is just another<br>classifier is the a decision friend so<br>this is almost is quasi fire peak everything<br>is work will be different the producer<br>in this case for I would we may in  to<br>use it i'll and has it over my ear<br>thailand is already file to be<br>cradle and as you can see something work work is<br>because there are of the politics sensor<br>measure<br>ah as oh it's quite interesting because<br>i be mine and instead of using all  in<br>one decision to use and symbol of<br>manganese fat third week and vinnie music<br>at a very very powerful<br>class 5 this is it becomes sambrosa do<br>you do like basic allianz offer what we<br>tries to image and her of go there 2 is<br>outside<br>to make them suffer  diverse and the psv<br>baby from the first so are because we<br>combine them<br>this is much more powerful than using a<br>new one decision tree so we can<br>make these decisions discredit<br>sensitive and so you can of the museums and<br>commitment image does decisions with<br>week and  sustainable the mission to you to<br>make this with broad and this is what<br>this call round frost is  d-day also using<br>this and sambal or we go<br>is this is like what we toolbar of<br>finally<br>wish yes this is when I with data<br>that may be weekend story like<br>appeals [ __ ] that knowledge score that in<br>excel<br>so this is the arm so that a  word by<br>very well but sometimes i'm feeling wit<br>yes that is beautiful complex about ending with<br>images found<br>sorry this case then that learning is<br>you know the blooming<br>basic that is how you want an active<br>scarf new networks idea is that is in<br>spite in  the bring in the saver who is<br>t of the structures<br>will michaux john i simple so beautiful<br>girl that we want to classify you to<br>someone's son of 2 gigabyte shares her<br>[ __ ] riot those penguins all the fans at<br>competition<br>so you this case howie gonna make up was<br>in fire of i an image<br>this money muscle well the muslim<br>suspicion is that we now image and<br>features<br>how you now image new features that<br>to the one size and bring to use to to<br>make a big or so in that cent what is wrong<br>that what we do would i know billion<br>in them italy billion rating the<br>friend and features<br>that he had was a good experience to<br>use then measured the final<br>production if so how cd planning is a 5<br>with your perfume cool<br>but maybe the prime i thought it would<br>use download a lot of energy<br>that chance is your mission is is  a little<br>tuft<br>we now again and musician you guys okay so I<br>think it was ah<br>introduction of what is a year how ya<br>know how we can use that so what harder<br>ideal for once so<br>how much gas in the positive site of<br>ijsselhal let's talk about the<br>challenges controversy or<br>what the experts arduino<br>if you look at the main experts to your<br>music alyan working for<br>campaigns that my business is<br>advertisement<br>ah yes yes using all of this new technix<br>or other time and all of these<br>new technical  or your iphone for your<br>problem howard became ice minister is<br>that so so this is something data is<br>that expression number I offer<br>controversial was analog think that is<br>charlie and since we are controversial is<br>the<br>greetings that there so we are going to see that<br>data is who there  I want to briefly what was<br>my year building with models<br>we year i want i want it using the doctor<br>so<br>the data is been to be a the the mos import<br>and things so<br>one thing is also i so far that there<br>wedgwood how you deposit that so the men<br>jets quite easy to use nice quote last<br>is  trams again easy-to-use where you<br>not to take into account that will you for<br>someone you
