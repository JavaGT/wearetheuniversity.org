will leave him to<br>welcome<br>hi um good evening yeah my name is alex<br>uh i'm the academic program leader of<br>the executive mba that basically means<br>i'm responsible to make sure that the<br>courses<br>uh that we have in the program uh make<br>sense are coherent and<br>have a good quality so i'm working a lot<br>with your lecturers i'm also<br>lecturing of course myself leading<br>digital transformation<br>where we discuss all the fancy it stuff<br>like blockchain and big data and<br>artificial intelligence yeah and i'm<br>also<br>working with poppy and charlotte<br>to make sure that the program<br>doesn't just consist about the courses<br>it's more than that it's<br>a whole experience so<br>we're working towards that we have part<br>of the program also professional<br>development i think you will talk about<br>that<br>um yeah and i'm here to say hello i'm<br>happy to<br>virtually meet you and i'm also happy to<br>reply to any questions you might have<br>brilliant thank you alex<br>so alex is going to sneak off out the<br>side um<br>you will hear from him later like he<br>said um so to introduce myself<br>my name is poppy norton i am the<br>professional program recruitment<br>manager and engagement so my role is to<br>help you<br>work out what program might be right for<br>you to talk a little bit about the<br>programs<br>and then we do have a whole team behind<br>the scenes helping you with your courses<br>like alex said he's there to provide the<br>academic support<br>that we do have which accompanies our<br>programs<br>so today i am going to talk about the<br>program in a little bit more detail<br>we do have a wonderful executive mba<br>student who's going to talk to you<br>about his experience in the program and<br>and we do encourage you to send us some<br>questions<br>so you should be able to see a q a or<br>question and answer function<br>please feel free to fire those questions<br>through while i'm talking to you today<br>we do have a team behind the scenes who<br>will be answering them<br>and but at the same time we might keep<br>them until the end<br>if there's some very common questions<br>coming through and we will answer them<br>live<br>on air so what we'll do though is we'll<br>go through some<br>some key facts about the program who we<br>are<br>and and then we will like i said answer<br>those questions<br>so we are telling a waka victoria<br>university of wellington<br>so that is the university that this<br>program falls underneath<br>if you've attended my webinars before<br>you you'll have heard all about the<br>university so today<br>i am just going to briefly touch on it<br>but i do encourage you to have a look at<br>our website<br>and watch any previous webinars if you<br>do want to find<br>out some more information about support<br>services that we have at the university<br>at the other programs and and the<br>university in general<br>on my screen though you will see a map<br>hopefully down the bottom there<br>and what it does is it shows you uh<br>where we are located in wellington<br>so wellington being the capital city of<br>new zealand it's quite a compact city<br>it's very easy to get around and the<br>university is spread across the city<br>and we have campuses or big teaching<br>areas<br>dedicated to different disciplines and<br>subjects<br>our main campus or our campus where our<br>arts and sciences are taught<br>that's kelvin campus which is located up<br>the hill<br>and but what you see on my map is<br>pippity campus<br>and that is where we teach our willing<br>to say our government our business and<br>our law programs<br>so at the professional programs office<br>we are uh<br>working for the wellington school of<br>business and government so we're located<br>at that piptail campus<br>and in rutherford house is the<br>particular building<br>so if you are familiar with wellington<br>you'll know the beehive or our<br>government buildings<br>we're just across the road from that<br>so i want to show you a zoomed in<br>picture might be coming up later of<br>where we are located<br>um in wellington here we go so the image<br>might be quite small in your screen<br>but what you should hopefully see there<br>if you are familiar with wellington<br>is the beehive and our government<br>buildings if the sun wasn't streaming in<br>through my window right now<br>hopefully you can still see my face<br>you'd be able to see the beehive over my<br>shoulder<br>and so that's just to show you where we<br>are located<br>so we're really lucky here at the<br>wellington school of business and<br>government<br>to be located right in the heart of the<br>cbd the central business district<br>we do take advantage of our location i'm<br>really drawing that through<br>through what we're teaching you or all<br>the industry connections and the<br>networking<br>that you'll have as part of your program<br>as a professional program<br>there's another zoomed in picture there<br>just to really show you where<br>where we are located in the wellington<br>city so the tall building or<br>so the building you hopefully recognize<br>the beehive the building behind that one<br>is our law school and that's the wooden<br>building<br>and then just to the side to that is uh<br>sorry about the feedback not sure what<br>happened there and so the building just<br>to the side of that is rutherford house<br>that tall<br>office looking building and that is<br>here's a shop from inside the campus it<br>is a really modern campus<br>it's a really beautiful place so please<br>if you are in wellington<br>we do encourage you to come and have a<br>look um<br>throughout the campus the top image<br>there is our library<br>the the campus is an uh public space<br>so you are welcome to come and wander<br>through and have a look<br>and and the image at the very bottom<br>there that is our professional program<br>student study space now something quite<br>unique about our professional program<br>students<br>and typically they are working alongside<br>their study<br>so about 80 of our students are studying<br>part-time<br>and working so we do have a dedicated<br>study space for you<br>if you're looking at needing a quiet<br>space to come and come and study or<br>network with your colleagues then that's<br>a really good space<br>and that you can juggle those things and<br>really dedicate some time to<br>to your study so what i will do now<br>is pass over to brian he like i said is<br>one of our executive mba students<br>and i'm going to ask him just to<br>introduce himself and talk a little bit<br>about the program<br>while i i bring up my slides while i'm<br>on this new computer so over to you<br>brian<br>yeah thanks for the introduction poppy<br>i'm brian charlowski i'm part of the<br>2020 cohort and as you might<br>tell from my accent i'm an international<br>student i'm from america<br>and i'm graduating at the end of next<br>semester in 2021<br>i chose to study in new zealand to to<br>grow my<br>international business business<br>experience and knowledge i have a<br>professional background in international<br>marketing and<br>business development and um yeah so i've<br>been<br>a part of the emb program for three<br>trimesters now<br>and i've really enjoyed the program it's<br>giving me exposure to<br>new zealand companies along with working<br>together with people in my cohort in my<br>group<br>it's given me a lot of leadership<br>opportunities opportunities to work<br>and lead with diversified groups<br>and yeah if you have any questions feel<br>free to<br>to go ahead and ask them in the chat i'm<br>happy to answer any questions about<br>studying i know it's a big decision<br>so one of the questions i've gotten<br>before is about a<br>balance uh a lot of the students in the<br>cohort are working<br>and the program is set up that you are<br>working<br>i personally i worked about 30 hours a<br>week so a little bit<br>under full time but i was also going to<br>school<br>full time as well taking three three<br>papers<br>and um so the course is set up quite<br>flexible that your lectures are on<br>fridays and saturdays most often and um<br>some night<br>courses as well but uh the teachers are<br>really flexible and working with you and<br>extending assignments if you need it i<br>found that extra flexibility<br>to really help me with you know my<br>professional development and also my<br>academic development<br>as well brilliant thanks brian we will<br>ask everyone to keep sending um the<br>questions through in the q a function<br>um so please definitely send them<br>through and we will<br>get brian to be answering those and just<br>because i have moved to a new computer<br>and i can't do my slideshow how i was<br>doing it but hopefully i've shared my<br>screen so hopefully you can all see it<br>and so again apologies<br>for the uh technical difficulties that<br>we are having today<br>and i will say we are going to run<br>through this webinar<br>and uh you can ask us any questions<br>through the q a function<br>but we are always available to have a<br>chat via zoom<br>or in person or over the phone as well<br>so<br>and if you can't read my slides today<br>then i do encourage you to<br>please come back in and have more of a<br>conversation with us about this program<br>but i will just run through my slides so<br>like i said hopefully you can see them<br>there<br>so our executive mba program is an<br>internationally recognized management<br>qualification<br>it's what we call a generalist program<br>and the reason behind that is because<br>you do build your skills<br>in in a wide range of areas so it does<br>help you if you're interested in moving<br>into senior management or senior<br>leadership<br>and really enhancing your leadership and<br>management skills<br>you come the program builds up the the<br>um subject knowledge in areas such as<br>management and marketing<br>and accounting and economics so you have<br>a really strong foundation to build your<br>your professional knowledge and your<br>academic knowledge from so when you are<br>working in businesses and you are<br>holding that senior leadership role<br>and you have people reporting to you who<br>might be accountants or econom economist<br>then you understand that what their the<br>kind of queries are and what you're<br>asking of them<br>while holding that that that strategic<br>role<br>so on the screen hopefully you can see<br>it so the executive mba<br>program is one of the qualifications<br>that we're talking about today<br>the other one is our postgraduate<br>certificate in business administration<br>and i will talk about the differences<br>between the two and one of my next<br>slides<br>um but this here is just a quick<br>snapshot of what our executive mba<br>program<br>looks like and how long it takes to<br>complete<br>so our quickest way to complete or our<br>intensive option<br>is it takes you 16 months to complete<br>that program<br>now when we talk about the the length of<br>our qualifications<br>we talk about it in terms of months but<br>we also talk about it in terms of<br>trimesters<br>and so if you have studied at um the<br>this university before trimester is<br>probably a familiar term<br>but if you're coming to us from a<br>different university or you actually<br>haven't studied at a university before<br>then you might not be too familiar with<br>the term trimester<br>but what trimester means is that we have<br>three teaching periods throughout the<br>year<br>so trimester one is our first trimester<br>of the year<br>and that's february to june trimester<br>two starts july till october<br>and then what other universities<br>sometimes called summer school<br>we call that trimester three so that's<br>november to february<br>so when we talk about our programs and<br>terms of trimesters you'll see that the<br>fastest way to complete this<br>qualification<br>is four trimesters so that includes the<br>summer school period<br>and it spans just over a year typically<br>though<br>we do have students who are working and<br>studying part-time with us<br>and so that usually means that they are<br>studying uh or takes<br>two years to complete or six trimesters<br>now the program is taught in a way that<br>it does allow you to work full-time<br>in our classes they're taught on fridays<br>and saturdays<br>now typically for each course that you<br>complete<br>you come to campus or you come to class<br>for four fridays and four saturdays<br>and during that time you'll be engaging<br>with your academics<br>you'll be having your class content and<br>your academic content talk to you<br>but also embedded into those hours is<br>professional development<br>so part of your qualification you do<br>need to have a number of professional<br>development hours<br>and they are embedded into the way that<br>the program is taught<br>so that when you finish your<br>qualification you finish with that real<br>lived and worked experience like i<br>mentioned before it is designed for<br>people with five years of executive work<br>experience<br>so that's typically people who might<br>have been in management or leadership<br>or roles that require you to have high<br>critical<br>and thought or or experience if you're<br>not sure if you fall under this category<br>please definitely have a chat with us we<br>can talk to you and we can find out more<br>about your work experience<br>and let you know if this program is the<br>best one for you out of our many here at<br>the professional programs office<br>and like i said it is staircase so when<br>i mentioned the other qualification<br>before<br>what we mean by staircasing is that we<br>have two qualifications that fall under<br>the executive<br>mba header and these qualifications<br>lead into one another or staircase into<br>one another<br>and i will show you what i mean by that<br>um a bit later on<br>also here in my next slide so<br>the first qualification in our executive<br>mba<br>suite is the postgraduate certificate<br>now to complete the postgraduate<br>certificate you complete<br>four courses and they're taught at<br>exactly the same level<br>as the masters level you just complete<br>fewer courses<br>in in your program<br>you can either choose to finish that<br>point or you can decide to keep going<br>and move through<br>into the full executive mba program and<br>again<br>those courses are at the same level you<br>just take more so to complete your<br>executive mba<br>you do complete 12 courses overall or<br>now on my screen you will see the core<br>courses listed<br>so these are eight uh or you take eight<br>of the core courses<br>and that are required and there's the<br>ones to give you that really strong<br>foundation in all aspects of business<br>you then get to choose our four elective<br>courses<br>and the elective courses here are the<br>courses that you can make<br>or choose to be unique to help you with<br>what your career goals or career<br>interests might be so we do have courses<br>which are specifically made for the mba<br>and the executive mba program and<br>they're the the top four<br>or five that are listed on my screen but<br>then we can actually<br>work with you and talk to you and work<br>out if there's another course<br>that we teach here at the wellington<br>school of business that fits better<br>with your career plans then we can look<br>at how we can bring that into your<br>program<br>to meet your specific career needs<br>our program is also taught in quite a<br>unique way so we have this<br>cohort structure and the idea behind the<br>cohort is that<br>when you're first class or in your<br>orientation week you get put into a<br>group<br>of um or a cohort group and the<br>this is supposed to simulate a<br>management team<br>so you will have people from diverse<br>backgrounds diverse industries<br>and you'll all bring your own unique<br>experiences into the program<br>and then you will study with this<br>particular cohort in this group<br>you will do assignments with this group<br>and the idea is that you you learn off<br>each other just as much as you're<br>learning off the academics who are<br>teaching you<br>and you bring your worked and lived<br>now the timetable is something we often<br>get asked about so i do have an example<br>timetable on the screen<br>and and so this is a part-time timetable<br>that i'm showing you<br>so in trimester one next year these are<br>the courses that we will be teaching<br>so if you are choosing to do two courses<br>then you will complete enba<br>501 and emba 503<br>second trimester you complete more of<br>those core courses<br>and again in your third trimester so<br>there you complete your six core courses<br>then when you move into the second year<br>then you've got<br>the final core courses and the emba 508<br>or 509<br>that's our domes our consultancy pro<br>course<br>so you can either do a domestic<br>consultancy or if travel allows<br>an international one then<br>you have those elective courses that i<br>showed you before<br>so you would finish off if you're<br>studying part-time with<br>the elective courses now the intensive<br>option so the option that brian is doing<br>is if you choose to do three courses and<br>per trimester<br>and what you'll see on my screen is it's<br>a little bit more<br>your courses are a bit more mixed up<br>with your elective courses<br>and that's a way that you can complete<br>this program in the shortest amount of<br>time<br>the professional development that i did<br>mention that is part of our program<br>and it does get included it was sorry<br>taught<br>through through your classes so the<br>fridays and saturdays that you'll be<br>attending classes<br>we will have that professional<br>development embedded into it<br>the professional development i have<br>examples on my screen of what our<br>students have done this year<br>and it's also there to support the<br>academic content that you're learning in<br>your class<br>now i've got a couple more slides and<br>i'm going to quickly uh skip through and<br>then<br>we'll open it up again for the questions<br>so<br>how to apply you'll see on my screen<br>uh we have you'd supply some supporting<br>documents<br>so with this program you jump online you<br>apply and when you apply you say what<br>program you're interested in studying<br>you then say what courses you would like<br>to do and i can email you the courses<br>that we have<br>uh send them through by email so you can<br>um have a look to see what<br>what courses are on offer or you'll find<br>them on our website<br>but the one thing i will say because of<br>that cohort structure<br>we do have different courses taught for<br>our different students so<br>if you are a bit stuck not sure what<br>courses are for you in your first year<br>we can share those with you then because<br>we do require you to have that executive<br>experience to get into this program<br>we do ask you to supply a cv and in that<br>cv we want to see<br>your work experience and it's just like<br>you're applying for a job but your cv<br>doesn't have to be any different<br>if you meet that executive work<br>experience requirement we will um<br>invite you to do an admission assessment<br>and the admission assessment can be<br>completed in your own time<br>in your own space and that's really to<br>get to know you<br>how you like to deal with challenges<br>whether you like to deal with challenges<br>and it's the way you you think and learn<br>and how you like to study<br>you then if you're that successful<br>you'll be invited for an admission<br>interview and the admission interview is<br>with alex who you met before<br>and our executive director of the<br>professional programs office<br>now on my screen i do have applications<br>are due on the 20th of january<br>that is the official deadline that the<br>university puts out<br>but because there is a fair amount of<br>paperwork that goes alongside your<br>application<br>we do encourage you to apply early just<br>because the process can take some time<br>and so we do want you to to get your<br>application in so we can start<br>processing that for you<br>so you'll be all ready to start your<br>study when when the program begins<br>now the last few things i am going to<br>touch on before i open up to questions<br>is talking about the financing your<br>study and that's a question we do get<br>asked a lot<br>so on the screen you'll see the cost of<br>the program for 2021.<br>now it does differ between domestic and<br>international students<br>so do have a look and see what your<br>program will cost<br>a common question we then get around<br>around the fees is how<br>you can pay for your fees do you need to<br>pay up front<br>and again this varies if you're a<br>domestic or an international student<br>if you're an international student i<br>encourage you to contact<br>our wonderful team at wellington<br>university international<br>they can help you work out how to pay<br>for for domestic students there are<br>quite a few different options you can<br>look into<br>for both sorry domestic and<br>international i encourage you to have a<br>look at our scholarships<br>so you can find scholarships on our<br>website it's the university's database<br>so have a look through<br>and they tend to add scholarships uh<br>often so if you can't find anything now<br>do have a look back<br>and you can also get your fees paid by<br>study link<br>so studylink are our student loans they<br>look after all student loans across new<br>zealand<br>and what happens typically is they pay<br>up front<br>and then you pay back your fees through<br>your pay<br>so a lot of our students do actually pay<br>a lot if not most of their<br>student loan off by the time that they<br>finish studying if you are studying<br>whilst you are working and the other<br>thing that i have on the screen is fees<br>free<br>now this is not very common and because<br>most of our students do have<br>academic study behind them but if you do<br>have a wealth of experience<br>and but you don't have a bachelor's<br>degree you can still apply for our<br>program<br>and we and if you do get a degree waiver<br>you go into that postgraduate<br>certificate option<br>if you do i go into postgraduate<br>certificate option and you don't have<br>you any a tertiary study behind you<br>you might actually be eligible for the<br>fees free scheme<br>so i definitely encourage you to have a<br>look to see if you are<br>and but now thank you for joining us i<br>am going to open it back up to questions<br>so i will um invite brian back<br>and hopefully you find some questions<br>through on the chat in the q a<br>um and we do have alex as well so um<br>please definitely fire those questions<br>through<br>so we do have a question that i'm<br>reading here and i can see that<br>brian has actually responded through the<br>chat but i might actually get brian to<br>um maybe touch a little bit more on that<br>so the question here is about how do you<br>find balancing work and study<br>and this is a really common question<br>that we do get so i'll get brian<br>uh to answer um maybe we people use in<br>the chat and build on that and<br>yeah yeah i can definitely build on that<br>um well i was<br>nervous my first trimester because it's<br>it was about<br>eight years since i last studied so i<br>did have concerns about how i would find<br>studying and working at the same time<br>especially because<br>academic background was a bit new for me<br>and<br>the the first week of the emba program<br>you're in a<br>induction where you meet your cohort and<br>you also go through various<br>trainings around setting you up on<br>studying and setting you up for<br>like life administration skills and um<br>that sort of helped me out a lot because<br>there i learned how to<br>write academically how to cite i also<br>learned<br>studying tips on how to maximize my time<br>since the emba courses for you know<br>upper management and executive levels<br>they teach you how to read a lot of<br>stuff very quickly because that's<br>super useful for anyone in those<br>positions so<br>that's kind of how i've i've caught up<br>on to it and uh yeah just fine<br>right there's quite a few questions<br>about workloads so hopefully one<br>has covered that um but and flexibility<br>too<br>i found i found the program to be<br>so we do have a question here which says<br>what does the executive experience<br>entail can you please um articulate on<br>this further so i might pass this one to<br>alex if you talk about the the<br>background that people required<br>to have to enter this program<br>yes so as part of the<br>let me just quickly start with the<br>admission<br>process so we have implemented a new<br>admission<br>process um which mainly consists of<br>doing interviews as<br>probably mentioned with charlotte the<br>executive director of the<br>professionals programs office and myself<br>and<br>the idea of these interviews is actually<br>to get to know each other so on the one<br>side we want to make sure that everybody<br>who enters the program<br>um is is in a way of what we would<br>determine executive in is in a<br>leadership position<br>and is able to perceive<br>the program with the with the eye of an<br>executive being able to<br>contribute to to conversations and<br>discussions<br>um and also getting the right things out<br>of the program<br>um at the same time we also want to<br>understand what your expectations are<br>so what we learn is obviously we're<br>investing a lot of time in these<br>interviews but we're really happy to do<br>that because we learn a lot<br>and we also use these interviews at the<br>end to see whether<br>we kind of delivered on our promises and<br>and what the students<br>hoped and expected to find um<br>and and what we learned specifically is<br>that<br>um when it comes to<br>the learning experience that the<br>students hope<br>to have flexibility during their courses<br>but also when they<br>choose their courses we are well very<br>aware that you're not just studying<br>you have a private life you have a busy<br>business life<br>you have many and also this might change<br>over time<br>so we want to give you the opportunity<br>to study in the right speed for you<br>but also doing a course and we just saw<br>that last trimester which<br>was proved and there's also other<br>obviously<br>things that impact your learning<br>experience you want to make sure that<br>during a<br>course you are able to uh to you know<br>like<br>um adjust or to to to learn in your own<br>speed<br>so we set up the courses in you in a way<br>that you have<br>that you don't have a big exam at the<br>end and you're like you're all preparing<br>and then all of a sudden there's two<br>weeks of exam weeks and<br>then when something is happening<br>privately or at the job<br>uh you're in big trouble we want to make<br>sure that you can<br>learn consistently over the trimester<br>which starts with the readings<br>of before the courses and you have con<br>on regular uh um<br>dates you have the face to face but<br>support your your learning experience as<br>well as<br>student groups so student groups are<br>actually very important for us maybe<br>brian you can also say a little bit<br>about that later and then um we want to<br>make sure that<br>uh we also give you feedback so if you<br>compare this to undergrad<br>it's typically that you have an exam<br>then you get your grades and you're done<br>what we do is that we assess you during<br>the trimester<br>we give you feedback which allows you to<br>you know like to<br>actually improve your skills during the<br>course so when you have the next<br>assessment a few weeks later you are<br>able to<br>use the feedback that we gave you and to<br>already by the end of the course already<br>have a feedback of how you have improved<br>over the course<br>not just having one big grade at the end<br>it doesn't<br>sometimes reflect really your learning<br>experience<br>so this brings me to the last point what<br>we want to acknowledge is that you're an<br>individual<br>and grades anyhow are not so important<br>to us what is<br>what because they are an absolute what<br>what do they say about how you improved<br>or<br>about your progress over time what we<br>want to see is that<br>you get the best out of the program you<br>improve or you build your skill set<br>um and that you feel that you got<br>something out of it so<br>this is also um kind of um<br>um this is also merit in in the way we<br>do assessments and how we structure the<br>courses<br>i hope that's at least on a superficial<br>level a bit<br>clear otherwise i can also give examples<br>but brian do you want to add something<br>to this<br>yeah i think that's good yeah very<br>flexible and it<br>the course just blends quite well with<br>either if you're a really busy<br>professional<br>or if you have a really busy family um<br>you mentioned student groups and that's<br>correct<br>everyone in my study group has different<br>sort of<br>life things they need to take care of<br>during the week<br>and it's all just a mix and um this the<br>school is<br>very flexible around that um a lot of<br>the coursework is stuff you work on<br>during your group<br>uh time so you just schedule a time that<br>works for you it can be on the weekends<br>it could be on the weeknights<br>it could also be virtual so yeah that's<br>and the only other question we have at<br>the moment here<br>um is at what stage should the gmat be<br>done so<br>around the admission process so if you<br>are an international student i do<br>encourage you to contact wellington<br>university international<br>i will be sending an email out after<br>this webinar with some contact details<br>you'll have my contact details but also<br>we will link to the wellington<br>university international team<br>so if you are applying as an<br>international student i do recommend you<br>contact them<br>because they can help you with the<br>really specific information<br>anything to do with visas um and so and<br>they can also talk to you around border<br>closures at the moment with with croven<br>19<br>so i do definitely encourage that you<br>talk to them if you are thinking about<br>just looking through the questions and i<br>i know that our craig has<br>answered some of them um i'm wondering<br>if either of you<br>um alex or brian um would like to answer<br>so someone who has asked about the<br>cohort um and explaining a little bit<br>more about<br>who's typically in the program or the<br>mix so i see that you've responded here<br>brian but<br>um maybe you could build on the cohort<br>that you're currently studying within<br>and the mix and the device<br>uh diverse nature of the students yeah<br>yeah definitely so um<br>the the student group that think it's<br>it's like 40 to or 60 students um it's<br>quite large and it's<br>very diverse um i think the commonality<br>is that<br>most most of the people there have<br>management experience<br>or similar to that and um<br>the industries that they represent are<br>very wide you'll have<br>people in emerging industries like<br>technology um for example like trade me<br>and xero<br>and then you have people that are in<br>government like defense<br>and also in farming industries as well<br>so i think the important aspect of that<br>is you get a very good<br>exposure to people from with different<br>experience different backgrounds and<br>like poppy said you really learn from<br>your classmates and people that are in<br>your team<br>just as much as you learn from your<br>professors you you sort of learn their<br>industries their approach to things and<br>yeah you<br>and it's also the idea sorry of the of<br>the executive mba<br>um to really so for us as lecturers to<br>facilitate<br>in class discussions or also online<br>where you actually can share um your<br>perspective and and<br>you learn from from your classmates um<br>that's generally the idea of an mba and<br>we really um<br>yeah we um strongly encourage<br>people actually to be part of the<br>conversation and to also<br>connect with people and also part of the<br>professional development is actually<br>the team building the cohort principle<br>is um<br>really important to us by the way also<br>part of our accreditation<br>uh with um with embar um so<br>yeah we um we put a lot of thoughts on<br>how we can actually<br>bring the right people in so that it's<br>an enriching conversation and as i said<br>that's why we also have the admission<br>interviews<br>to make sure that everybody was there<br>doesn't always mean that they are just<br>senior executives sometimes you also<br>have people<br>that um that have their own startups or<br>you know like um working in different<br>functions it's more about<br>um being able to to benefit from the<br>conversation and being able also to<br>contribute to the<br>to the conversation fantastic<br>so i see that the questions have have<br>slowed down oh as i say that another<br>question pops up<br>um so we've got a question here i'm a<br>working professional thinking of<br>completing this course in 16 months<br>what is your advice on this are you<br>against this or can it be done<br>um so i might i might get alex to answer<br>this one but then brian you're<br>more than welcome to forgive your<br>feedback because i know that you've<br>um well it depends i guess it really i<br>would say it depends<br>it depends on many things i mean how<br>how much do you work do you have a<br>private life and many things i mean in<br>theory it's possible<br>um and it really<br>i mean what you should be aware of is<br>how much effort<br>is each course um and so we have each<br>course is 15 ects and one ecgs is 10<br>hours so<br>that means that one course is 150 hours<br>so when so if you would like to complete<br>in 16 months<br>uh let me think but it's between three<br>and four<br>courses per trimester yeah at least<br>three<br>um so that's like um 100 450<br>at least 450 hours about 30 hours a week<br>that you would be dedicating yeah<br>exactly<br>um and well i mean it's<br>we're not saying it's not possible in<br>fact what<br>what um um especially poppy is actually<br>doing is also<br>uh when you come in and and it<br>around when you do admission interviews<br>again is actually planning your<br>your schedule and and i think she's<br>doing a really good job in helping you<br>also to<br>to to to ask the right questions like<br>what are you able to realistically do<br>and not<br>and if you and her after having an open<br>conversation you feel really you can do<br>it it's not<br>that anybody here will sit and say oh my<br>god this person is crazy it's just that<br>we feel responsible for your uh and<br>especially puppy<br>for your study success so she will make<br>sure that you<br>really are also honest to yourself<br>yeah that's it's um definitely doable<br>and there's i have a lot of classmates<br>that are doing it they're working 40<br>hours a week and taking<br>all three of the courses i just think<br>the the realistic expectations is you'll<br>probably study on the weekends<br>and you'll you'll work in group work and<br>you'll study a bit on weeknights<br>the good news is that with the emba<br>courses you're not necessarily studying<br>alone<br>you're usually applying the coursework<br>with the team<br>on a real life business so it's work<br>that you can meet up and get into groups<br>so it's a bit enriching because you're<br>with people you're not studying alone<br>um and yeah it'll just challenge how<br>organized you are and how productive you<br>can be<br>and um it's definitely possible but you<br>will be studying a lot<br>but what is important is that you it's<br>not<br>a done deal like when you say you want<br>to try it and you realize after one try<br>message just too much<br>or you have a change of circumstances<br>privately or in business or so<br>then it's you're always able to reduce<br>your workload<br>or at least temporarily reduce your<br>workload and increase again<br>so that's actually a nice thing that the<br>um<br>the curriculum that we have designed now<br>and the schedules that we have<br>worked out now i i agree i know also um<br>i had brian and his calling in the last<br>trimester and i know that some of them<br>do the three uh courses and others do<br>too<br>and some do just one because it's<br>currently not the right time to do more<br>and it's perfectly fine and they also<br>always get<br>obviously then that out what they hope<br>um<br>in terms of workload and in terms of<br>content<br>and we do have a lot of academic support<br>but also holistic support<br>so a previous webinar that i have done<br>is around the support services available<br>at the university for postgraduate<br>students<br>i do recommend that you uh watch that i<br>see in the comments<br>quite a few people are talking about<br>workload you're juggling a busy job<br>you're juggling having little kids<br>running around<br>and so i do recommend having a look at<br>that webinar we do cover things across<br>the whole university<br>like i mentioned the academic support<br>that there is the student learning do an<br>amazing job with that<br>but they can also help with the holistic<br>side helping look at your schedules<br>helping you plan some time to study<br>and again we do have that professional<br>program study space so<br>a lot of our students do meet there<br>while they're doing their either<br>individual study or<br>meeting with their cohort so it is a<br>space for you to have some time out and<br>dedicate some time just for your study<br>fantastic no other questions have come<br>up while we have been talking<br>like i said though i will be sending an<br>email out to thank you all for joining<br>me<br>to for joining us today and please fire<br>through some questions<br>in the email if you go away today and<br>suddenly think of some more<br>we are located in rutherford house which<br>is that building that i showed you right<br>at the beginning<br>so if you are in wellington cbd cbd i<br>encourage you to come and check us out<br>and you're more than welcome to sit down<br>have a chat look at the courses<br>and we can work out a good plan for you<br>but otherwise i'd love to say thank you<br>so much for joining us thank you alex<br>for joining us um<br>and thank you brian and but otherwise<br>have a wonderful evening<br>and we look forward to talking to you<br>soon</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
