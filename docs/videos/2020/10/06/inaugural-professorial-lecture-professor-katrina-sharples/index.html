She studied at the University of Auckland, and gained a PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Washington in Seattle. She has been a co-investigator on a range of projects, notably in cancer epidemiology, cancer trials, infectious diseases and drug safety. Her interest is in the nature of evidence, the influence of random variation, and how we obtain reliable evidence from research to improve health and well-being.<br><br>She co-led the establishment of the Health Research Council of New Zealand Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which monitors investigator initiated clinical trials funded by the Health Research Council. She is a founding member of Cancer Trials New Zealand led by Professor Michael Findlay, of the Pharmacoepidemiology Research Network led by Associate Professor Lianne Parkin, and is the

everyone<br>my name is harleen hayne and i'm the<br>vice chancellor here at the university<br>of otago<br>and it gives me great pleasure to<br>welcome you to<br>this inaugural professorial lecture for<br>katrina sharples<br>now on behalf of the university i would<br>like to extend<br>first a very warm welcome to the members<br>of katrina's family who are here this<br>evening<br>um her husband professor ian morrison<br>and their son reuben<br>um no my haramai to both of you it's<br>fantastic to have you here<br>and as i look out on the audience i<br>would also like to warmly welcome<br>staff and students from around the<br>university<br>and members of the wider dunedin<br>community and i'd particularly like to<br>acknowledge our chancellor dr royden<br>somerville who is here this evening<br>and i note former vice chancellor um<br>professor sir david skegg who is also<br>here so welcome david it's fantastic to<br>have you here<br>now these lectures as you know are a<br>time for<br>celebration for all of us and i'm<br>delighted to see<br>that so many of you braved the weather<br>to come out here this evening<br>and share in the celebration of<br>katrina's huge accomplishment<br>but tonight is special for other reasons<br>as well this is one of only a handful of<br>ipls that we've been able to hold this<br>year<br>due to covet 19. and i think it's<br>important for all of us who are here<br>this evening to acknowledge how truly<br>lucky we are<br>because presentations like this with<br>people sitting so close together like<br>you are in the audience<br>are virtually unable to occur in most<br>parts of the world<br>so thank you very much katrina for<br>giving us a reason to come together<br>and spend time in fellowship with each<br>other<br>now as you will learn from her lecture<br>this evening<br>professor sharples is an effective and<br>motivating teacher<br>a popular postgraduate supervisor<br>and an incredibly successful researcher<br>one important hallmark of her research<br>career has been her ability to forge<br>strong and productive relationships with<br>clinicians<br>biologists and other statisticians<br>provided exceptional service to her<br>discipline<br>to her academic departments and to this<br>university<br>so katrina on behalf of the university<br>of otago it gives me great pleasure to<br>personally congratulate you<br>on your promotion to professor it's been<br>very well earned<br>i'm really looking forward to your<br>lecture this evening as i know<br>everyone else here is as well so i will<br>now call<br>on the pvc of sciences professor richard<br>barker to tell<br>us just a little bit more about<br>katrina's um journey to professor<br>katoa<br>vice chancellor deputy vice chancellors<br>professor sharples professor schultz<br>tanakwe<br>professor morrison tanakwe<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight professor katrina<br>sharples<br>to give her inaugural professorial<br>lecture at the university of otago<br>as indicated by the vice chancellor<br>katrina is one of our newer professors<br>at the university<br>having received a well-deserved<br>promotion to the position in february<br>of this year born in the uk in swindon<br>in fact<br>katrina and her older sister determined<br>that they didn't want to grow up with<br>a british accent and decided to move to<br>new zealand<br>and after a brief sojourn in dunedin<br>where her father was a<br>locum doctor the family settled in<br>hamilton in 1966.<br>now katrina is a rarity she is a second<br>generation statistician as her mother<br>faye was also a statistician and<br>lectured at the university of waikato<br>with a natural interest in mathematics<br>katrina studied at the university of<br>auckland and graduated with a bachelor<br>of science and mathematics in 1981<br>followed that with a masters<br>in 1983 before commencing her<br>association<br>with otago being appointed to the<br>position of scientific<br>officer biostatistics in the department<br>of preventive and social medicine the<br>same year<br>and i believe she was appointed in fact<br>by professor sir david<br>who's with us tonight what a good<br>appointment<br>yes in 1994 katrina took up<br>a medical research council fellowship<br>and enrolled for her phd<br>at the university of washington where<br>she gained her phd<br>under the renowned biostatistician<br>norman breslow<br>statistics is my field and i know just<br>what a<br>phenomenal statistician norm breslow was<br>the title of her phd was regression<br>analysis of correlated binary data and<br>for those of grow<br>those of us growing up in the dark ages<br>of frequentest inference this was a<br>tricky problem<br>after completing her phd katrina<br>returned to new zealand in 1990<br>as a medical research council<br>repatriation fellow so i guess she got<br>repatriated<br>which was good and resumed her work in<br>the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine<br>katrina's roles and positions in the<br>university have been many and varied<br>with quite a number of fractional<br>lecturing and research positions which<br>we<br>don't have time to go through but they<br>together amount to some 25 years in the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine<br>and then more recently as a professor in<br>the department of medicine a research<br>professor<br>and a professor in the department of<br>mathematics and statistics<br>tonight we celebrate her rise through<br>the ranks from scientific officer to<br>full professor and as the vice<br>chancellor<br>has alluded to this promotion is for<br>high achievement<br>katrina has published more than 90<br>research papers<br>and has nearly 4 000 career citations<br>her focus of interest is clinical trials<br>which are causes of enormous<br>interest to all of us as consumers of<br>modern medicine in one way<br>or another and for this work she was<br>awarded the new zealand society of<br>oncology<br>translational research award in 2013.<br>in addition to her research her<br>influence on health<br>through wise use of data and inference<br>extends into her teaching<br>which include has included the challenge<br>of teaching biostatistical methods to<br>medical<br>surgical and oncology registrars she's<br>also taught<br>biostatistics at postgraduate and<br>undergraduate level<br>through the university for me one of<br>katrina's enduring teaching legacies has<br>been stat 115<br>which she developed with john haraway in<br>1997. i see john is with us tonight<br>this course was initially developed as a<br>required paper for the first year health<br>science students<br>although it was dropped from the list of<br>required courses i believe in 2005<br>stat 115 has continued on and still<br>attracts more than 700 students<br>annually and remains an entry point to<br>the fascinating world of data and<br>inference<br>the very foundations of modern science<br>and medicine<br>katrina's leadership is evident through<br>her professional service<br>she's a member of the health research<br>council data and safety monitoring<br>committee<br>and has chaired this committee since<br>2008<br>she has also served on a number of other<br>health research council committees<br>she's a member of the australasian<br>gastrointestinal trials group<br>monitoring board and as a consultant for<br>the national ethics advisory committee<br>as well she has served on the genesis<br>oncology trust grant assessing committee<br>and also the cancer research trust grant<br>assessing committee<br>katrina has many talents and will be<br>known to a number of us<br>as a viola player in the dunedin<br>symphony orchestra<br>so there you go tonight katrina is going<br>to talk to us about clinical trials and<br>in particular the requirements for<br>ensuring that the information they<br>provide is both useful and<br>reliable please join me in welcoming<br>thank you richard and harleen for your<br>introduction<br>and thank you everybody for coming here<br>today<br>um it's been uh an interesting day uh<br>and i'm very grateful for you all that<br>you've braved the weather to make it<br>here and and hopefully the roads home<br>won't be too bad when you get there<br>afterwards<br>i think there are a couple of people<br>hopefully joining uh from<br>by video too so i just want to welcome<br>them john crump i think sitting in<br>managed isolation up in auckland<br>so welcome to my talk today<br>i'm very grateful to be giving this talk<br>uh and harleen has already mentioned<br>some of the reasons uh thanks to the<br>covert 19 epidemic there have been very<br>few ipls<br>and i'm very pleased to be able to be<br>here giving the talk today<br>but i'm also very grateful to be here<br>because of all the many opportunities<br>that i've had throughout my<br>uh career i've always felt personally<br>that my career was<br>somewhat serendipitous and<br>of course as richard as mentioned my<br>mother was a statistician as well so<br>my father also was a doctor and so it is<br>perhaps likely that there was some<br>subconscious unconscious parental<br>influence<br>going on there my<br>first real exposure to statistics was as<br>a student i actually i should just show<br>you the photo because i've got one there<br>so this is my mother and my father uh my<br>sister is the older one and i'm the<br>little one there<br>so anyway that was before we came to new<br>zealand so the little<br>english children there who still had<br>so my first real exposure to statistics<br>was when i went to the university of<br>auckland<br>and that was something of a golden<br>period for statistics at the time<br>with aleister scott there who was<br>probably my main mentor at the<br>university there<br>but also george sieber allen lee and<br>chris weil so a great introduction to<br>the discipline of statistics<br>i also had the chance there to<br>experience some applications of<br>statistics in the health sciences<br>and so it was a very easy decision for<br>me that this was a career that i wanted<br>to have was very lucky again<br>uh that when i had graduated from my<br>um from auckland with my master's degree<br>i guess at the time<br>uh they became available in the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine<br>down here in otago a training position<br>in biostatistics<br>david skeke as was mentioned was the<br>chair of the department at the time and<br>he offered me the job<br>which i was very pleased to accept and<br>moved down to dunedin<br>where i rapidly learned that i really<br>i had some great mentors uh in the<br>department of preventive and social<br>medicine in addition to david charlotte<br>paul obviously but also<br>uh george spears and peter herberson and<br>sheila williams i see up there<br>who was around at the time so i had the<br>opportunity to learn a lot there but i<br>still really felt that i needed some<br>more education<br>david uh we know is a man of strategic<br>vision and and he also could see the<br>value of me going off<br>overseas somewhere and doing some<br>further education at an institution with<br>a strong biostatistics group<br>and he encouraged me to go overseas to<br>do a phd<br>help me obtain funding to go and to come<br>back again<br>so with the support of my husband ian i<br>then headed off to the university of<br>sorry here's the photo remember to push<br>i might just get some water<br>so the next move then was the university<br>of washington<br>and the biostatistics department at the<br>university of washington was a very<br>exciting place to be<br>there was an immense amount of expertise<br>and statistics for epidemiology and for<br>clinical trials<br>um and i enjoyed it very much norm<br>breslow as richard has mentioned<br>uh it was a fantastic<br>advisor and supervisor he was chair of<br>the department at the time that i was<br>there<br>and he was very much a photographer very<br>much one of the founding<br>figures of modern biostatistics he<br>had an encyclopedic knowledge immense<br>insight and wisdom he also spoke many<br>languages<br>and loved climb mountains very an<br>amazing person my other main mentor at<br>the university of washington<br>uh was tom fleming who actually joined<br>the university of washington about the<br>same time<br>as me but he came from several years<br>working as a biostatistician at the mayo<br>clinic<br>and he has been at the forefront of<br>developments in clinical trials<br>for a very long time particularly in<br>while i was doing my phd with norm i<br>also worked for him as a research<br>assistant at the national wellness<br>tumour study<br>there was a data statistical<br>coordinating center in seattle where i<br>worked<br>situated with the fred hutchinson cancer<br>research centre<br>and it was a wonderful opportunity for<br>apprenticeship style training<br>and i often think i learned probably as<br>much if not more from this experience<br>working for this group as i did from uh<br>doing my phd and all the coursework in<br>there<br>so it was a wonderful opportunity uh the<br>only downsides to this to working for<br>this group is that the acronym<br>nwts was pronounced nitwits<br>may have been true of me at the time but<br>certainly wasn't for this<br>dan dangio uh was who was the the head<br>of the<br>he was a very gifted collaborator um and<br>he was a pioneer in the treatment of<br>cancer<br>if any of you have read the emperor of<br>all maladies you may have seen<br>a small reference to dan in there in<br>the booth in chemotherapy with that<br>father in boston<br>will skewer is a rare childhood cancer<br>tumor um<br>so there's about five to six hundred a<br>year in the us<br>and in 1969 dan pulled together a<br>multi-disciplinary team<br>which consisted of radiation oncologists<br>and oncologists<br>dan green bruce beckwith as a<br>pathologist in north bristol as a<br>statistician<br>and they formed a nationwide<br>collaboration networks of networks of<br>clinicians who are treating women's<br>tumor<br>in order to advance the treatment and<br>improve outcomes for children with wilms<br>tumor<br>the motto of the study was pure is not<br>enough<br>and this indicates the goal very clearly<br>at the time when they started the study<br>they did have treatments for<br>tumor they were surgery radiotherapy and<br>chemotherapy<br>and these are small children their<br>median age that they were diagnosed was<br>about<br>two um so you can imagine that this<br>treatment had pretty horrendous effect<br>on these children<br>so the focus of the series of trials was<br>very much on risk stratification<br>trying to identify tumors which had no<br>poor prognosis<br>where those children could be targeted<br>for more intensive therapy<br>and also identifying tumors which had<br>more favorable cognitive<br>prognosis so that the intensity of<br>treatment could be reduced without<br>impacting<br>so during the years of the national<br>wilderness trials they successfully<br>enrolled<br>uh the majority of the children treated<br>they improved outcomes for many children<br>they improved outcomes for the children<br>with tumor who were treated as part of<br>the study<br>they were all getting the best possible<br>standard of care right across the united<br>states<br>and of course the trials themselves<br>improved the problem of care for future<br>patients<br>and i think the together with the<br>european group the national wounds tumor<br>study<br>uh really set the standard of care for<br>the future for<br>uh will's children i should just mention<br>a targo connection there briefly if i<br>can because i can see him sitting over<br>there i remember a day when i was in at<br>the long stream of study and norm said<br>to me<br>who is this guy from otago who's uh<br>wanting to get access to the<br>tumor sample from the world and that was<br>of course my first introduction<br>i led a a a wonderful program in<br>um<br>so when i returned to new zealand after<br>this experience<br>i came back to prevent social media<br>where i worked with<br>david with charlotte and<br>cancer epidemiology and also his aids<br>epidemiology group<br>and these were again fantastic<br>opportunities for me<br>and they dovetailed beautifully with the<br>probably they're a bit you know sorry<br>that the universe american universities<br>gowns are not made for actually doing<br>things and<br>and they'd be nicer to have just you<br>know sleeves anyway i'll try not to<br>so i came back to knitting wonderful<br>experience working in preventive and<br>social medicine with many good<br>colleagues there<br>david and charlotte in particular but<br>others as well<br>a little later on i met a guy called<br>mike finley<br>who was an oncologist who's recently<br>returned from sydney<br>and we started talking about cancer<br>trials in new zealand and about<br>building a cancer clinical trials<br>network to support investigator-led<br>cancer trials in new zealand and<br>eventually in 2003 that led<br>to the establishment of cancer trials<br>new zealand uh<br>which is uh run under the direction of<br>mike<br>and so i've spent i guess all the time<br>since then 20 plus years<br>and i guess over that time period i've<br>done quite a lot of thinking talking<br>reading working<br>in clinical trials and so i've made the<br>decision today to talk about<br>particularly about clinical trials to<br>talk about the nature of evidence<br>and about making decisions and about how<br>much evidence we need<br>now of course clinical trials are only<br>part of the evidence we need<br>but it's only a 45-minute talk so i'm<br>many of you will be familiar with<br>clinical trials i don't know how many<br>people here or some over there certainly<br>uh who this for whom this is their daily<br>bread<br>others of you may have read about them<br>in the media recently<br>uh there have been discussions uh in<br>relation to covert 19 about the evidence<br>for treatments<br>for cover 19 and things like the lack of<br>effectiveness for hydroxychloroquine<br>and also for convolutional plasma of<br>course there are some trials underway<br>randomized controlled trials are our<br>gold standard for obtaining reliable<br>evidence on benefits and risks<br>of new therapies the standard randomized<br>control trial as we know it today has<br>not been around for that long really<br>development sort of started in 1950s and<br>60s<br>but there was a lot of development<br>taking place in the late 80s when i was<br>at the university of washington<br>the developments were brought about by<br>convergence of sort of several<br>uh strands um the first of these was<br>just a growth and understanding of the<br>science of clinical trials<br>and by which i mean the actual methods<br>that we use in the clinical trials to<br>get reliable uh<br>evidence there was also development in<br>the<br>regulatory processes there were some<br>very unfortunate experiences<br>for example with the use of thalidomide<br>to treat nausea and pregnancy<br>uh which led to the governmental<br>authorities<br>requiring reliable evidence for foreign<br>treatments before approving treatments<br>for use<br>there's always also development in<br>thinking and practice<br>around ethical contact of trials and<br>ethical review processes<br>in new zealand in 1987 there was the<br>cartwright inquiry<br>into the treatment of women with<br>cervical cancer at national women's<br>hospital<br>and the establishment of our own ethical<br>system for ethical review here<br>there was also a recognition of the need<br>for independent oversight of trials<br>to safeguard the rights of the trial<br>participants and to monitor the emerging<br>data<br>to make sure make recommendations about<br>whether or not the trial should continue<br>when i returned to new zealand after my<br>time in seattle it was very apparent<br>that there was a lot of expertise in new<br>zealand and<br>in clinical trials but there was very<br>limited expertise<br>in the data monitoring committees the<br>groups that monitor the trials provide<br>this independent oversight<br>so the then uh chief executive of the<br>health research council bruce scoggins<br>and i set up<br>the health research council data<br>monitoring committee system to provide<br>independent oversight for public good<br>trials that were being run in new<br>zealand<br>and my colleague from university of<br>washington tom fleming<br>uh very kindly agreed to come down from<br>seattle to chair<br>this committee for the first 10 years<br>while we went the ropes<br>for some reason we had to have the<br>meetings in the summer i don't know why<br>but<br>these developments of uh and clinical<br>trial conduct have been cemented now<br>through a myriad<br>of international guidance documents<br>about good<br>practice and clinical trials so in<br>but determining how much evidence we<br>need about the risks and benefits of<br>treatment<br>um is still very complex<br>it requires a sound understanding of the<br>nature of evidence<br>and very careful consideration of the<br>individual versus the collective ethic<br>that is the desire for evidence that<br>will benefit future patients<br>versus the welfare of current patients<br>when there is devastating illness there<br>is pressure to make potentially<br>beneficial<br>agents available in a timely manner we<br>saw this in the early days of the hiv<br>aids epidemic<br>we've seen it again recently with ebola<br>with covert 19<br>and we see it all the time with cancer<br>patients particularly patients with<br>advanced cancer<br>for whom there are no other treatment<br>options<br>in the next few slides i want to show<br>you some examples of the thoughts of<br>sorts of things we need to think about<br>when we're weighing up the level of<br>evidence required<br>so the first thing i want to mention is<br>the idea of clinical endpoints<br>in order to demonstrate a reliable<br>benefit from a treatment<br>we want evidence that the treatment<br>improves<br>something that matters to the patients<br>so we want to know that the patients<br>will live longer or that we will have<br>experienced better quality of life<br>or that we'll be able to function better<br>than we would have been able to without<br>this new treatment<br>treatment impacts can often be seen<br>earlier through the effects on<br>biological markers<br>but the effects of these biological<br>markers things like tumor response<br>cholesterol level blood pressure<br>don't necessarily translate into<br>tangible benefits to patients<br>one classic example comes from the caste<br>trial and cardiovascular disease<br>the drugs incandite and fleconite have<br>been shown to suppress arrhythmias<br>and it was proposed that they might be<br>useful in uh preventing death and people<br>who had a heart attack<br>the trial was overseen by a data<br>monitoring committee who were reviewing<br>the accumulating information in the<br>trial<br>and part way through the trial it became<br>clear uh very unexpectedly that<br>while inconite and fleconide were<br>reducing the risk of arrhythmias in<br>patients<br>they were actually increasing the risk<br>of sudden death<br>so the data and safety monitoring<br>committee made the recommendation<br>that incandescent recognized should be<br>discontinued<br>and this shows the results from that<br>trial these are survival curves we've<br>got 100<br>people alive at the beginning of the<br>study and as the trial goes on deaths<br>occur<br>but the top line here is the placebo<br>group so they were doing much better<br>than the group on enconite and fleconide<br>this makes it look pretty dramatic but<br>there's a cut in the axis there just<br>the other thing that we need to think<br>about is the duration of follow-up<br>we want comparative data on risks and<br>benefits of treatments<br>over a relevant time frame and it's<br>easier if the benefits and the risks<br>accrue equally<br>during follow-up but that isn't always<br>the case<br>so i'm going to show you a couple of<br>examples here the first one<br>is a comparison of bone marrow<br>transplant with chemotherapy<br>in the treatment of acute myeloid<br>leukemia<br>these again show the survival curves and<br>the patients who will get the bone<br>marrow transplants are shown by the<br>solid line here<br>and you can see that they uh initially<br>um the patients<br>tend to do worse there's a there's a<br>drop uh drop off here due to transplant<br>related mortality<br>but if patients survive the first 50<br>weeks or so then they tend to do quite<br>well<br>on the other hand the patients on<br>chemotherapy uh do a little better early<br>on<br>but those benefits don't last<br>and so if we in this study like this<br>we only followed people up for about 50<br>weeks for about a year the picture that<br>we would have<br>on the relevant relative the relative<br>benefits and risks<br>of bone marrow transplant and<br>chemotherapy would look very different<br>so having that longer term follow-up is<br>really important for getting a good<br>picture of the relative benefits and<br>the other one i want to mention is a<br>trial<br>the outcast trial was comparing<br>laparoscopic and<br>open surgical treatments for colon<br>cancer this was<br>one of the first studies that we<br>monitored in the health research council<br>data monitoring committee<br>um and it was re it was headed by phil<br>baker and randall<br>at randall allardyce from christchurch<br>but there's also on australian<br>the idea of laparoscopic surgery i don't<br>know if anyone's had laparoscopic<br>surgery here but<br>the idea is that with laparoscopic<br>surgery you can do the surgery by making<br>a series of small incisions<br>and putting a camera in he can explain<br>this camera and<br>tools down in there so that you can do<br>the surgery of just small incisions<br>and which in principle should be better<br>than making large incisions where you<br>can get in with<br>you know a little bit more uh space<br>the less invasive laparoscopic surgery<br>was hypothesized at the time this was a<br>while ago now<br>hypothesized to lead to faster recovery<br>time so less time in hospital<br>faster return to work there were some<br>potential risks that occurred around the<br>time of the surgery<br>that could have been worse with<br>laparoscopic surgery than open but the<br>major risk with the laparoscopic surgery<br>compared to open surgery<br>relates to the cancer outcomes that<br>would occur way down the road<br>and so the important thing is to make<br>sure that we would<br>that when looking at those short-term<br>benefits we have enough follow-up<br>to make sure that we haven't increased<br>the risk of<br>relapse of the cancer three to five<br>seven eight years out<br>so that we don't offset the benefits<br>which is about a day in hospital<br>but so not a huge benefit from<br>afroscopic surgery and certainly not<br>much to weigh the potential for<br>increased<br>cancer risk as it turns out most there<br>were about<br>four or five trials internationally and<br>there doesn't seem to be an increased<br>cancer risk so<br>the next thing i want to talk about i've<br>talked about you know what we want for<br>this<br>sort of good convincing information but<br>what happens if we don't have enough<br>information<br>what happens if the information that we<br>get about the treatment is just not<br>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo<br>is a modified heart lung machine that<br>was first proposed as a treatment for<br>newborn babies with respiratory<br>insufficiency back in the early 80s<br>you can imagine this would be a very<br>difficult place to do randomized<br>controlled trials<br>but there were some done but they were<br>very small<br>and there were also questions about the<br>designer for studies<br>and so even though these these small<br>studies had been done<br>back in 1982 the results of those<br>studies were not sufficiently strong<br>to convince people that this was a<br>treatment that should be used in these<br>newborn<br>babies and it wasn't until 1996<br>when the uk collaborative ecmo trial<br>group published the results of their<br>larger study<br>uh that it became there was clearly<br>demonstrated<br>that the ecmo was beneficial that<br>improved survival in these infants<br>so i think the message for that one is<br>that if we don't have convincing<br>information<br>we can end up having to wait a long time<br>to get the convincing information and if<br>the trial had been done<br>the bigger trial better trial done<br>earlier on many more infants<br>would have ended up being treated with<br>the other issue is what happens if<br>evidence is over interpreted<br>one of the key aspects of interpreting<br>evidence is<br>understanding what random variation<br>looks like and this is a lot of what<br>data monitoring committees do<br>we're monitoring results as they come in<br>from from trials early data<br>not very much of it and lots of random<br>variation<br>i just want to give one example here<br>perhaps one of the more dramatic<br>examples but there are many examples of<br>this type<br>and this is a study uh it was a study<br>carried out by the medical research<br>council on in acute<br>myeloid leukemia and in this study at<br>the time<br>the standard treatment was to give four<br>courses of a particular therapy we're<br>not gonna<br>worry about what it was and the idea of<br>this trial was to see whether<br>adding an additional course of therapy<br>would improve<br>outcomes for these patients<br>it was overseen by a data monitoring<br>committee and there was a specified<br>criteria in the protocol for early<br>termination of the trial<br>which was that if they observed a<br>treatment benefit were the p-value less<br>than .002<br>then that would justify early<br>termination<br>the dmc for the study reviewed the<br>results annually<br>uh and the first time when they looked<br>at the data was in 1997<br>and at that time they had 100 people in<br>each group and what they saw was 15<br>deaths<br>in the group who were getting four<br>courses of therapy and<br>only seven deaths in the group who were<br>getting five courses<br>so half as many but this wasn't a lot of<br>data it's<br>very um uncertain at that point in time<br>not statistically significant<br>not very convincing at all so no doubt<br>about this we just continue on with the<br>study<br>so in 1998 they reviewed the data again<br>and<br>but they saw actually quite similar<br>results so<br>42 deaths with four courses of treatment<br>compared to 23 deaths<br>in five courses of treatment and the<br>p-value now was .003<br>so the evidence of benefit with five<br>courses is starting to look<br>quite strong so at that point the data<br>monitoring committee<br>decided that they didn't want to wait<br>for another year to look at the data<br>again that they wanted<br>to have a look in six months so they<br>had another in six months and what they<br>found was still<br>an estimated treatment effect which was<br>substantially in favor of<br>the extra course of treatment and a<br>p-value of 0.002<br>now at this time they could have<br>followed the guideline and recommended<br>early termination of the trial<br>but you can see that there's still some<br>space there so clearly they didn't do<br>that<br>um and it would have been a very<br>difficult decision for them and they've<br>written about it in the publication<br>that i've referenced at the bottom there<br>um but<br>they they didn't recommend determination<br>because they simply didn't believe this<br>treatment effect<br>or that what this was no magical therapy<br>this was just one more<br>course of a treatment that they already<br>had four courses of and they simply<br>didn't believe that with that you would<br>get<br>a halving of the risk of death<br>so they took very deep breaths and let<br>the study continue and i should say that<br>the only people who are seeing this data<br>are the independent data monitoring<br>committee the data is confidential to<br>that group and so they are charged<br>with the responsibility of making these<br>decisions<br>so fortunately for them if they let out<br>collective size of relief<br>as the study went on things changed<br>and by the time they got to the end of<br>the study it was very clear that there<br>was<br>no evidence that the extra course of<br>therapy made any difference at all<br>to the outcome this is a somewhat<br>extreme example but it shows you what<br>random variation can do<br>in the dangers of reacting too early<br>with<br>information which looks like it might be<br>promising<br>the important points from these examples<br>are that<br>we want evidence of benefit on clinical<br>endpoints<br>on things that matter to the patients we<br>want enough information about benefits<br>and risks<br>over a relevant time period that we can<br>truly understand the benefits risk<br>profile compared to other treatment<br>options<br>if we fail to get adequate treatment<br>from the trials we risk<br>delays of adoption of withdrawal<br>treatments and conversely adopting<br>so i want to move forward a little bit<br>time time now within the cancer arena<br>and talk a little bit about the rise of<br>genomic medicine<br>and this is not my area of expertise<br>there are people here who know a lot<br>more about this than i do<br>i've been an observer of what's been<br>going on of this<br>from my position in cancer trials over<br>the last 20 years<br>and of what we've all seen i'm sure<br>other people have observed as well is a<br>massive increase in the understanding of<br>tumor biology over this time period<br>and this has had a huge impact on the<br>it might be a fairly familiar picture to<br>some of you<br>the ben garton hype cycle so initially<br>there<br>was huge excitement about the potential<br>benefits<br>with the genomic medicine and there were<br>some very notable successes early on as<br>well<br>the idea that we could identify the<br>aspect of the tumor target that with the<br>treatment created this idea of<br>personalized medicine which we still<br>think of as being a sort of a holy grail<br>um and the the the couple of early<br>successes<br>a couple of examples one was uh gleevec<br>for treating um<br>chronic myeloid leukemia and time<br>magazine there<br>and another one were was which you might<br>have seen in the media here too as well<br>was one of the checkpoint inhibitors um<br>pembrolizumable patruder which is used<br>to treat melanoma<br>but sadly the successes haven't been<br>quite as frequent<br>as we would have hoped initially<br>and one of the things that we've learned<br>is about the huge diversity in cancer<br>so diversity between tumors and<br>different people but also<br>diversity within a tumor within one<br>person and diversity in the tumors over<br>time<br>and just as an example i'm just going to<br>give you uh<br>a a picture from a paper from peter<br>campbell so peter campbell is also an<br>otago graduate he has<br>degrees in medicine and statistics which<br>i think is a wonderful combination<br>and peter's uh now heading up a group at<br>the sanger institute<br>and this was one of the studies that<br>they did looking at<br>driving mutations in patients with acute<br>myeloid leukemia<br>so the driver mutations and mutations i<br>think makes the cancer grow<br>and what they found was this huge<br>diversity with many of these driver<br>mutations occurring in just small<br>this tumor diversity creates enormous<br>challenges<br>for treatment evaluation what we're<br>trying to do<br>is identify driving mutations biological<br>pathways which can be targeted by<br>particular treatments<br>we know that different tumor types will<br>respond to different treatments and we<br>want to create these magical pairs of<br>these targeted treatments<br>but when we have lots and lots of<br>subgroups and more and more targeted<br>treatments coming in<br>we get this enormous increase in the<br>number of trials that need to be done<br>with diminishing numbers of patients<br>available in each of the subgroups<br>i've talked about the pressure to make<br>promising treatments available<br>sooner for patients who are in need and<br>of course this does apply to many of<br>these cancer patients<br>in the u.s the fda the regulatory<br>authority there<br>have a number of processes by which this<br>can happen so you can get approval<br>earlier in the course of treatment<br>development sorry<br>the one i want to focus on here is the<br>orphan drug<br>designation because i think that's<br>particularly relevant when thinking<br>about these<br>small subgroups and uh cancer trials<br>uh so orphan designation uh with open<br>destination uh<br>the special grant status statuses given<br>to um orphan<br>diseases by the orphan drug act<br>in order to treat these rare conditions<br>or diseases<br>so the pharmaceutical industry are not<br>going to make a lot of money by<br>developing and evaluating treatments for<br>very small groups of people<br>so it's incentivized through this<br>process and so<br>there are various types of incentives<br>some of them are tax breaks<br>but also uh exclusivity so protection<br>from market competition<br>and in the us at least this appears to<br>have had uh the negative<br>consequence of driving drug prices up<br>there are similar designations uh in<br>europe and in new zealand uh along this<br>so it's not just the u.s it's just a<br>there's there's more information so it's<br>easier to show you some things about the<br>um the processes there so<br>a guy called jonathan darrow earlier<br>this year published a review<br>of fda approvals that have been granted<br>and this shows the different programs<br>i'm not<br>that some of these are just about fast<br>tracking through the fda<br>rather than any special sort of<br>designation but the<br>orphan drug uh here are the dotted line<br>and what you can see in 2016 and 2017 is<br>this enormous increase<br>in the orphan drug coming through there<br>the other aspect to this which i think<br>is important<br>was demonstrated in a paper from<br>kethelheim in 2011<br>where he took uh the cancer drugs that<br>have been approved by the fda through<br>2004 through 2010 and he looked at the<br>trials that have been done<br>for the orphan drug approvals and the<br>non-orphan drug approvals<br>and what he found with that was that a<br>lot of the orphan drug<br>approvals are coming through with single<br>arm trials so no comparison group at all<br>70 of them and also that the end point<br>for these studies<br>is a biologically important disease<br>response or<br>reduction in size of tumor reduction in<br>tumor burden or something like that<br>um so that they're being approved with<br>not so much evidence and not high<br>quality evidence for many of them not<br>all but but many of them<br>the other thing that he showed in his<br>paper was the uh serious adverse event<br>rates<br>and uh the serious adverse event rate in<br>the orphan drug trials was about 4800<br>patients<br>and in the uh normal firearm was about<br>36 per 100 patients so lots of serious<br>adverse events<br>from these drugs in these cancer<br>patients<br>so there are risks from these drugs it's<br>not comparative we don't actually know<br>how much of this is disease and how much<br>is drug but<br>but there are clear risks and the<br>benefits are<br>less certain when we don't have such<br>reliable evidence<br>so overall i think the importance<br>of reliable evidence and risks benefits<br>of treatments is clear<br>but all as is the difficulty of<br>balancing the need for<br>timely access to promising new<br>treatments against the need for reliable<br>evidence and i think this tension will<br>always exist<br>but what we want to do is to try to do<br>our best to maximize the chances of<br>getting reliable information in a way<br>which is ethical<br>and acceptable to the patient<br>populations<br>the current systems are struggling to<br>part of the organ uh drug designation uh<br>and these early approvals are to do with<br>need<br>that there are no other alternatives for<br>these patients and so they should be<br>approved<br>but part of it also reflects the<br>difficulty of doing trials in small<br>groups of patients<br>but when i look back to the national<br>warms tumor study there were five to 600<br>patients a year so a whole lot less<br>than the 200 000 patients per year that<br>you need for the orphan drug designation<br>and so part of our problem here is not<br>so much that we don't have the patience<br>but that not many patients are actually<br>able to participate in the clinical<br>trials<br>there are a range of figures available<br>out there in the u.s from sort of three<br>to eight percent of patients<br>um that they've asked have have seen<br>them participate in clinical trials<br>and of course many patients may not want<br>to take part in clinical trials<br>but what we do know is that for many<br>patients then<br>they are not trials that they can take<br>part in<br>um either because there are no trials of<br>that for their condition available at<br>the institution or they don't meet the<br>uh eligibility criteria for that trial<br>we know that trials tend not to be done<br>on representative groups of patients so<br>people with comorbidities who are taking<br>other drugs and things like that<br>often find that uh there are no trials<br>that they can take part in<br>so i think the greatest capacity we have<br>for increasing access to evidence-based<br>medicine in the future<br>is to create infrastructure around<br>clinical trials so that we can<br>streamline treatment evaluations<br>and there's a long history of uh<br>clinical trial networks<br>uh so people getting together to try and<br>do the streamlining<br>um but it's recognized that what we<br>currently have isn't<br>enough so there are various things<br>happening in this space<br>and i'm not going to talk about a lot of<br>them but i just want to mention a couple<br>of things<br>briefly uh the first of those is<br>uh that we're seeing an increased use of<br>things called master protocols<br>and the i so the standard fog standard<br>randomized control trial has<br>one new treatment and a group of<br>patients on standard therapy<br>a single patient population and we're<br>looking at the outcome<br>in those two arms the idea of the master<br>protocols is that we can look at<br>potentially a broader group of patients<br>and we can evaluate multiple different<br>groups of patients<br>and multiple different drugs within the<br>they can also involve changes over time<br>so some drugs will be dropped from the<br>trial<br>as they either turn out not to work or<br>look promising enough that they're taken<br>on for further development<br>patient groups can also be added to the<br>trial as time goes on here's an example<br>of a um oh next one sorry there you go<br>here's an example of a master protocol<br>which is uh from the uk and it's<br>consumed with prostate cancer<br>this is a moderately simple one i have<br>to say<br>and they started in 2005 they had one<br>standard care arm<br>and then they had five uh experimental<br>arms where they added<br>uh additional drugs to standard pair and<br>so they ran that trial as was for a<br>while<br>and then the black dots here represent<br>where they uh evaluated<br>the effects of those treatments compared<br>to standard of care<br>dosatexel was found to improve outcomes<br>uh<br>when added to standard care so that was<br>then added to the standard care arm out<br>here<br>and you can see that they've added other<br>treatments as time has gone on<br>and the currently this was published in<br>about 2017 so representing the current<br>state of that study<br>there's a big study called um oh<br>i'm not going to remember the name camp<br>recap which is about and community<br>acquired pneumonia which the guys in<br>auckland are involved with colin<br>mcarthur<br>and shane mcginnis which is a national<br>thing but<br>lead initially from australia and and<br>and with the there is from patients in<br>intensive care<br>and one of the things about their master<br>protocol is that when covert arrived<br>they were just<br>able to add covert into their master<br>protocol and start evaluating treatments<br>for covert<br>so it provides a very rapid ability to<br>respond<br>the second thing that i want to mention<br>the emergence of initiatives both in new<br>zealand and overseas<br>to increase the capacity and the<br>relevance for clinical research<br>so the idea is we want to to increase<br>the connectedness<br>of people involved in clinical trial<br>activity so connectedness<br>between researchers and consumers in<br>particular<br>but also with industry government and<br>funding organizations<br>so there's there is the australian<br>clinical trials alliance which is a<br>network of clinical trial networks<br>so a big organization uh which provides<br>a voice and a structure for building<br>these<br>um connections many new zealanders are<br>involved<br>in transtasma networks and are members<br>of this australian clinical trials<br>alliance and they've done a lot of good<br>work<br>in trying to work out sort of how we can<br>think about setting up this<br>infrastructure<br>there are similar things uh in the uk<br>and in the us looking at this<br>transformation of clinical treat<br>trial research or clinical research in<br>general and substantial<br>public good funding coming behind these<br>things<br>in the new zealand health research<br>strategy document 2017-2027<br>that sets out a vision that by 2027<br>we'll have a world-leading health<br>research and innovation system<br>the four guiding principles are around<br>research excellence<br>transparency partnership with maori and<br>collaboration for impact<br>so that's collaboration with many groups<br>certainly patients<br>maori pacific and many other people<br>involved<br>they have a list of four strategic<br>priorities there<br>around first of all equity and<br>trying to make sure that we address the<br>health needs of all new zealanders and<br>reduce the<br>current inequities and health outcomes<br>but also around building a vibrant<br>research pathway research environment<br>building and strengthening pathways and<br>translating research findings<br>and also trying to advance and innovate<br>ideas and<br>commercial opportunities this is a very<br>broad strategy clinical trials<br>infrastructure is just one part of this<br>and currently<br>i should just say this is run by the<br>ministry of<br>business innovation employment and by<br>the ministry of health and health<br>research council<br>one of the arms for clinical trials<br>which i will mention briefly here<br>there's an hrc rfp looking at enhancing<br>new zealand's clinical trials<br>and the goal of that is to facilitate<br>the development of a sustainable<br>nationally coordinated and equitable<br>clinical trials enterprise in new<br>zealand make sure i get it right<br>otago has a lead role in one of the<br>things that's gone in we were supposed<br>to hear last month but we haven't yet<br>coming out i think tomorrow we have a<br>very broad group of investigators<br>a large number of investigators so we'll<br>keep our fingers crossed<br>for tomorrow but either way hopefully we<br>will see a development<br>of infrastructure in the future so thank<br>yes thank you very much katrina or<br>should i now refer to you as professor<br>sharples<br>um the reason why i'm here is uh i'm<br>michael schultz i'm one<br>i'm the head of department of medicine<br>and i'm also a gastroenterologist so i'm<br>kind of on<br>in the receiving end of some of the work<br>that you're doing and<br>we're all crying out for evidence-based<br>medicine now when<br>richard said in his introduction that<br>you took up the challenge of teaching<br>medical<br>students about statistics i cringed and<br>i thought<br>is he talking about me and when you<br>invited me to do this summary here i<br>thought oh god<br>she's gonna talk about something i don't<br>really understand<br>i struggle with i should understand but<br>you must be and you are<br>an excellent teacher because this talk<br>was just absolutely fantastic and i wish<br>i would have<br>had a statistics teacher like yourself<br>because that probably would have engaged<br>me a little bit more we learned today<br>about<br>why and how you became a statistician<br>i'm very grateful for you to come back<br>from the us<br>all too often we see people venture<br>outside and see the greener pastures<br>somewhere else and then stay there<br>thank you for coming back and thank you<br>for staying involved with us<br>we also learned a lot about the early<br>clinical trials we learned about<br>the challenges that you really have to<br>wait you have to be patient<br>before you can make a decision whether<br>the medication is actually worthwhile<br>pursuing or not<br>are there any risks involved do we stop<br>the trial too early you showed this very<br>nicely with this one slide when<br>basically half of the population was<br>dropping off dying in fact<br>in the first few months but then the<br>rest stayed alive so yes it was a good<br>idea to carry on this trial<br>because it was much better than the<br>placebo trial and you finished<br>really by saying that it becomes more<br>and more difficult<br>running clinical trials because there's<br>so many questions that we need to ask<br>ourselves<br>and so many factors that come into that<br>we need<br>huge networks that all work together<br>i think in a way this is a little bit of<br>wishful thinking isn't it<br>because there are so many interests that<br>play a role<br>into how to run a clinical trial not<br>only to speak about<br>who is actually going to run this<br>clinical trial now if you think about<br>commercial clinical trials<br>there's a huge interest in making this<br>drug successful<br>so i believe the sponsor of the trial is<br>working very hard<br>to make sure the right patient group is<br>in there for the right amount of time<br>to show benefit there is 10 years at<br>least<br>that went into the lab work before a<br>drug reaches<br>the clinical trial stage so nobody would<br>have an interest to<br>have this time and money go to waste and<br>i think you<br>showed this really nicely clinical<br>trials should be run by governments but<br>i don't think there is a government who<br>can afford this<br>they're huge they're multinational and<br>as we've seen and you mention it<br>although i think covet only played twice<br>or three times a role in your talk<br>which was very refreshing compared to<br>what we listened to<br>elsewhere we see this with covet that<br>there's huge political pressure and huge<br>pressure from<br>from uh well everyone really to come to<br>a vaccine<br>i'm not quite sure if some cutting<br>corners is the right way to do that<br>and we talked briefly before this<br>presentation here about the transtasment<br>bubble<br>and the treble bubble well not only do<br>we want a vaccine<br>that doesn't have any side effects of<br>course but we want it to work<br>because that would really be detrimental<br>so i think we have to be patient<br>but thanks to you i think we all now<br>have a better understanding what goes<br>into these clinical trials the planning<br>the analysis and the patience that you<br>probably need<br>to wait for the right drug to come<br>along i would like to close with<br>presenting you with this little token of<br>appreciation katrina<br>you've done a marvelous job today you've<br>done a marvelous job<br>so far and i'm very certain you will do<br>your marvelous job in the future thank<br>you very much and<br>i would like you to join me to thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
