more about our<br>organization and our website which is<br>otago<br>alumni.us as a parent myself i can<br>attest to the fact that the global<br>pandemic has had a significant increase<br>in the amount of screen time for my kids<br>so i'm super excited to hear from our<br>subject matter experts today<br>uh professor rachel barr and professor<br>elaine reese<br>who john will provide a proper<br>introduction to shortly<br>for those tuning in live want to<br>encourage you to ask questions using the<br>q a function on the bottom right of your<br>screen<br>and we'll definitely have

welcome<br>yeah thanks daniela um yeah i'm john<br>crow<br>i'm the treasurer of au auoa<br>living and working from home here in<br>brooklyn new york<br>with my wife three teenagers and a teen<br>year old um<br>and i as i look to see my teen year old<br>she's sitting on the couch<br>playing fortnight with a youtube screen<br>on a mini ipad right next to her<br>our fifth child is actually back in<br>dunedin adotago is a first-year health<br>science<br>student so i'm very much looking forward<br>to gleaning some practical insights<br>from today's webinar so moving right<br>along<br>i'm delighted to introduce professors<br>rachel barr and elaine reese<br>dr blah is professor of psychology at<br>georgetown university<br>and director of the georgetown early<br>learning project<br>she received her doctorate in clinical<br>psychology from the university of otago<br>in 1999<br>she's primarily interested in how<br>children bridge the gap<br>between what they learn from media and<br>how they apply that information in the<br>real world<br>dr barr has published over 50 papers<br>investigating the effects<br>of the content and context of media on<br>early learning<br>and during this webinar she will cover<br>the transfer deficit<br>which is the consistent finding that<br>infants and toddlers<br>learn less from television and touch<br>screens than from face-to-face<br>interactions<br>and importantly how parents can overcome<br>this trend<br>this transfer deficit and facilitate<br>learning from media<br>i'm also delighted to introduce<br>professor elaine reese<br>dr reese joined the department of<br>psychology at otago in 1993<br>she is the education domain leader on a<br>national birth cohort study<br>growing up in new zealand she has<br>authored over 80 papers and has served<br>on the children's action plan<br>a government committee to help at-risk<br>children<br>through her career she has been a<br>principal investigator or co-principal<br>investigator on four mastering grants<br>from the royal society of new zealand dr<br>reese has followed how parents talk<br>creates change in children's language<br>narrative<br>memory literacy and self-understanding<br>she is especially interested in the role<br>of parents storytelling with their<br>children<br>and is the author of the book tell me a<br>story<br>so welcome rachel and elaine and over to<br>you<br>well um i'm delighted to be here as well<br>and<br>um one of the really big bonuses is that<br>elaine and i uh got to start talking<br>again<br>our fields have overlapped um quite a<br>bit<br>over um time and i was lucky enough<br>to receive some training from elaine<br>when i was at otago um<br>and um from from harleen hayne as well<br>who was my primary mentor and so<br>this is this is fantastic so what we<br>decided that we'd do though rather than<br>do a series of slides<br>um is that we would have a conversation<br>and<br>ask each other um about our various<br>uh domains of work um and and how they<br>have<br>uh how they how how children may be<br>uh affected during this covert time um<br>based on screens and and their learning<br>so elaine i think you were going to<br>start<br>uh yes so just uh thank you everybody<br>for being<br>here today and it is a this is<br>going to be well we hope really fun and<br>it has been<br>um great uh for me to reconnect with<br>rachel<br>and i should just add that um that uh<br>that i'm a parent also i have uh two<br>sons<br>19 and 24 who are both at otago now<br>um the older one doing a masters and the<br>first one doing<br>first year and um<br>and yeah so rachel and i um know each<br>other from<br>from way back and and i thought i would<br>just start off by<br>asking um asking you rachel<br>just to get the ball rolling what do you<br>recommend in terms of screen time<br>because i know it's something that<br>everybody is<br>even more concerned about now than um<br>than ever<br>yeah and that's always the question the<br>question is always framed how much<br>time should we a lot to screens<br>um and there has been a lot of<br>recommendations from the american<br>academy of pediatrics they have<br>recommended<br>various amounts so for children under 18<br>months<br>zero screens children one and a half to<br>five<br>about two to three hours per day as long<br>as there's some sort of<br>activities around it and then<br>school-aged children maybe<br>uh three hours per day up to obviously<br>with covert a lot of that has really<br>changed because school has moved online<br>um<br>with you know almost 50 percent of<br>schools are completely remote<br>uh in the us right now so i'd rather<br>one thing i'd sort of like us to think<br>about is not necessarily just the amount<br>of time<br>but rather what it is that you do with<br>those screens<br>so all screens are not created equal<br>and what i mean by that is that you may<br>have<br>a video chat with someone you may learn<br>from a webinar<br>you may have a class you may watch<br>spongebob<br>uh you may play a minecraft or a<br>fortnight<br>all of these different interactions<br>serve different roles and have different<br>functions<br>um and involve interacting uh in various<br>different ways and so if we think about<br>how people are using screens why people<br>are using screens rather than just the<br>amount of time<br>um i think it's gonna be it's it's a<br>much<br>richer way of thinking about it because<br>then we might want to<br>reduce some types of screen um but<br>enhance others and support and encourage<br>other<br>forms of use because after all it's just<br>a tool<br>and humans are just so innovative and<br>creative that they've come up with this<br>amazing ability for us all to connect<br>uh during this time of covert but how it<br>is<br>impacting them will really vary as a<br>function of content<br>and context and did you want to say just<br>a little bit about what john was talking<br>about at the beginning with the video<br>transfer<br>deficit for really young children yeah<br>and and it's quite possible so this<br>transfer deficit<br>is if if you learn something virus<br>screen by yourself<br>and you're under five years of age<br>you'll learn less<br>than if you learn it in a face-to-face<br>interaction and<br>the thing is though this transfer<br>deficit can be ameliorated<br>in lots of different ways right so um<br>and one way that's quite simple<br>is repetition so you might as a parent<br>have uh read the same book over and over<br>and over<br>or watch the same episode over and over<br>and over and wondered if your children<br>were trying to drive you crazy<br>but they're really not what they're<br>doing is they're picking up different<br>pieces of information<br>with each different repetition and then<br>the other thing is if you are<br>reading it with them or watching with<br>them or playing with them<br>then they're getting different pieces of<br>information as<br>from you as you are explaining oh<br>that's a cat just like the cat that we<br>have in our house<br>and helping them connect the dots<br>between what's on the screen<br>and what's out there in their real world<br>and those<br>two things um talking just as if<br>so talking like you would around a<br>storybook um<br>if you do the same thing around um an<br>app or the same thing around viewing tv<br>or even the same thing while you're on a<br>video chat<br>children really require that support and<br>that reduces that transfer deficit<br>um and which which sort of brings me<br>to the point since we have seen that<br>some of the factors that are really<br>uh important for book reading transfer<br>over to television<br>you have got a long history of of<br>learning about what<br>um supports kids in book reading what do<br>you think<br>would be the main things kids would<br>learn from books or can learn from<br>picture books<br>yes i am some would say obsessed with<br>children's picture books and and their<br>benefits for<br>young for young children um there are so<br>many benefits from<br>sharing picture books with your children<br>one of the<br>main benefits is that it helps their<br>language development<br>so we know that um we know that children<br>learn new words from books and they can<br>learn<br>um learn words that they might not<br>encounter<br>in their everyday lives um<br>and we also know that<br>they're also learning some<br>socio-emotional<br>skills from books um they're learning<br>about other people's thoughts<br>and feelings so theory of mind<br>learning can come from books because a<br>lot of<br>picture books go into detail on what the<br>characters are thinking and feeling<br>and um and eventually that<br>you know their language skills um can<br>coalesce into children who have been<br>read a lot of picture books in high<br>quality ways<br>have better reading skills later on when<br>they go<br>and so what we know is that<br>the way you share books with your<br>children matters<br>a lot for how many of these benefits<br>they get and um<br>and we know now that there are certain<br>high quality ways that can maximize<br>those<br>benefits and it's it's not<br>rocket science actually it's very simple<br>it's it's about<br>having a conversation about the book as<br>you're sharing it<br>um a conversation that's responsive to<br>what the child is interested<br>in talking about um but that also<br>extends their learning and so i'm glad<br>you brought up the<br>repeated readings because i know this is<br>a common theme for<br>parents of young children who<br>when their children want the same book<br>over and over and over again and for<br>my sons it was thomas the tank engine<br>which i<br>absolutely hated reading um but they are<br>still<br>every time they're getting something<br>else out of it<br>and you can have fun with it by<br>through the conversation you're having<br>um extending<br>it to different aspects of the book um<br>to<br>to help them expand their learning um<br>and that's a it's a routine that you can<br>engage in<br>even with babies with toddlers with<br>preschoolers<br>you you make it more challenging for the<br>older children<br>i'd argue that we stop reading<br>too early to our children um<br>we tend to stop reading to them once<br>they go into primary school and start<br>reading for themselves<br>but actually they've done surveys of<br>children who say that they<br>five to twelve-year-olds who say they<br>really wish their parents would still<br>read to them<br>um and and i think that's something<br>that um that we can<br>uh in the time of coved that<br>you know the benefit of being stuck at<br>home all the time<br>together is that you can<br>engage in some of these practices<br>that you might not be able to when<br>you've got the daily commute<br>and all the activities um maybe setting<br>up a tradition of<br>of continuing to reach your older<br>children<br>at night from chapter books or books<br>that<br>you loved as a child and you can share<br>with them<br>um would be a really nice way to extend<br>the practice<br>yeah it's um it's interesting just this<br>month as well<br>um a study came out that was book<br>reading via video chat<br>and it turned out that four-year-olds<br>could also learn<br>if there was a book read to them via<br>video chat<br>um and so i think this is another way<br>that if you are<br>thinking of different activities to do<br>on video chat with your grandkids or<br>nieces and nephews or even during um<br>zoom school reading a book is something<br>that they can<br>also learn and share over the screen to<br>and and it is when you were talking<br>about what it is that<br>is the key skills so describing and<br>extending and having this back and forth<br>conversation<br>we also did a study with 15 month old<br>babies<br>and they learned how to work a touch<br>screen<br>and or you know a tablet and they<br>learned a game<br>and they learned how to play the game um<br>and transfer it out into the real world<br>and it turned out that if the parents<br>did every single thing that you were<br>talking about<br>warm and sharing and following what the<br>child was really interested in<br>those children were 19 times more likely<br>to learn i've never had such a big<br>finding i always say<br>19 times more likely to learn from their<br>app<br>if they had this beautiful back and<br>forth like just like you would do with a<br>storybook so<br>i think these are things that parents<br>know how to do<br>that grandparents know how to do that<br>teachers definitely know how to do<br>um and that we know that really helps in<br>learning to read<br>and learning from screens but i'm<br>wondering<br>are the findings the same with ebooks as<br>they are<br>with picture books ebooks are<br>um a hot topic of research right now um<br>in this area<br>uh because they are i mean the use of of<br>ipads is becoming so touch screens has<br>become so<br>prevalent for young children and<br>sometimes those conversations can get a<br>little disrupted<br>um when an ipad has too many sort of<br>bells and whistles<br>like too many hot spots and games and<br>things like that<br>um it can distract the<br>parent and the child from having those<br>high quality conversations<br>but um if if you just<br>or if the parent and child are reading a<br>basic ebook<br>they can still have those high quality<br>conversations<br>so it's really the high quality<br>conversations that matter<br>regardless of how the book is delivered<br>as long as um kids and parents aren't<br>getting<br>too distracted by all the other features<br>um and then those it's sort of a mixed<br>bag because um<br>those features are also really engaging<br>to children<br>and and sometimes they'll even look<br>longer at an ebook than<br>um than they will at a a print book and<br>for older children uh there have been<br>some<br>studies showing that uh they can<br>actually learn<br>more new words from an e-book because<br>they can use the dictionary function<br>really easily to touch on a word they<br>don't know<br>and have it defined and that same child<br>is never<br>ever going to probably when they're<br>reading a print book go and look it up<br>in a dictionary<br>yeah so it's sort of about maximizing<br>those features and designs and i've<br>also heard that um for children who have<br>more difficulty learning to read or<br>um if the if the books are really well<br>designed<br>then that can support the learning even<br>more<br>so sort of the design pieces really had<br>of course there's<br>80 or 90 000 apps in the<br>app store there and and books that are<br>tagged as educational without<br>any regulations so it's very hard for<br>parents to<br>to pick out stuff um from there but it<br>sounds like there are sort of key<br>principles like if we can look for<br>things<br>that are engaging and interesting to the<br>child and meaningful<br>that they invite the social interaction<br>and that the child is sort of<br>minds on like they're looking up the<br>word or they're asking you a question or<br>they're answering you a question<br>these are the sorts of games and books<br>that are going to support learning<br>yeah that's exactly right that minds on<br>active engagement is<br>is the key um<br>no i was just thinking about um uh what<br>you were saying<br>about video chat um in the the video<br>chat<br>um book study which which is a really<br>cool finding that<br>um that the four-year-olds<br>four-year-olds can learn just as much<br>from a video chat<br>book reading as they can from<br>a regular book reading do you want to<br>say more about<br>uh more generally about learning from<br>video chat yeah so<br>it seems like learning from video chat<br>and this is kind of important when we<br>think about remote learning at the<br>moment especially for little kids right<br>learning from video chat has got this<br>extra information<br>like it allows you to have this back and<br>forth<br>that is really that key ingredient to<br>learning<br>and it turns out that um there's various<br>different games that they've shown on<br>video chat so you can show a child<br>hiding something they'll go find it if<br>it's on video chat<br>you can show them the exact same video<br>and they can't go and find it<br>because they can't figure out that what<br>is on the screen<br>is related back to the real world but if<br>it's on video chat<br>and you've got this reliable<br>conversation then they're going to be<br>more likely to believe it so they go to<br>find things they're more likely to copy<br>from video chat<br>more likely to learn new words and verbs<br>as long as there's a supportive<br>person not just on the the other side of<br>the screen teaching them<br>but on the side of the screen with them<br>so that that<br>co-viewer with them again is really<br>important even during video chat<br>for tasks that are hard to learn and i<br>think part of the thing is that we as<br>adults<br>we think although maybe not so much i<br>think in the past as adults we thought<br>okay<br>the video chat is so easy everything's<br>right there or the video is all right<br>there or the app has got so many uh<br>interactive components<br>the child must just be able to pick it<br>up and learn really easily from it<br>and they can't unless they have support<br>but i think covert maybe has made us a<br>little bit more empathetic to these<br>young kids<br>that really there needs to be a little<br>bit of support around that learning<br>right like<br>oh yeah if you look in this part of the<br>screen or<br>um when grandma is pointing to something<br>she's actually pointing to something<br>behind you um and that<br>having that caregiver beside you just to<br>sort of guide you not all of the time<br>like i i don't want people to go away<br>thinking that parents have to be<br>you know especially parents of kids<br>under five who are really really<br>stressed out<br>that they have to be 24 7 with their<br>children if there's any screen<br>uh present but just sort of every now<br>and then to provide them<br>extra little pieces of information and<br>video chat<br>as i said it really is both sides of the<br>screen that's important so if you're<br>talking to grandma and she's<br>describing stuff to you um then having<br>you<br>and the baby the the adult and the baby<br>there<br>helps that baby learn even more uh from<br>that rich<br>social interaction so humans like rich<br>social interactions right like<br>this is what we've been saying over and<br>over and over and how do we maximize<br>that<br>and engineer that um properly in the<br>screen to guide<br>uh and help children to focus and learn<br>learners is the<br>million dollar question really but but<br>they can definitely learn more from<br>video chat than they can from other<br>forms of media<br>that's really exciting given how often<br>we're all using video chat these days<br>i think it's also good um<br>um what you were saying about um that<br>parents don't always need to be there<br>because<br>uh that is a<br>i know that a lot of parents are feeling<br>pressured to<br>um to to be there even with their older<br>children the whole time that they're<br>trying to do online schooling and<br>do you have um any<br>anything you'd like to say about that<br>about how often do parents need to be<br>there<br>yeah and so i mean the the thing is<br>parents know their individual<br>kids the best obviously and um<br>some kids are gonna you know be more<br>independent than<br>others but it can there's certain things<br>if there's<br>um content that they know well or<br>characters that they know well<br>oh you know if you think of an episode<br>of um<br>thomas the tank engine or daniel tiger<br>or i'm staying all under under five or<br>even if you think of like sort of the<br>formulaic nature of a lot of<br>television programs children are<br>learning that<br>structure and once they've seen those<br>episodes a couple of times<br>then that supports their learning and<br>the best study that i know of from this<br>is if any of you remember the show blues<br>clues<br>um what the child had to do was go<br>through and find these different clues<br>and when they first put it on ear they<br>put it on uh once<br>and the three-year-olds couldn't find<br>the clues um but then they put it on<br>five times in a row<br>and the three-year-olds got closer and<br>closer to the clues by the end of the<br>week and they could solve it by<br>themselves at the end of the week<br>and they were sort of engaged and and<br>sort of searching for those different<br>things so again that<br>that knowing what the child's content is<br>thinking about the repetition thinking<br>about the structure if it's well<br>structured and well developed<br>they can learn uh on their own um and<br>this is what teachers are having to sort<br>of navigate at the moment is figuring<br>out<br>how to structure that information so<br>that the child can be supported<br>and then knowing the child sort of<br>learning and the parent learning<br>when when they need to step in but a<br>good rule of thumb is just sort of<br>let the child try it out first of all um<br>see what they figure out and as you<br>would<br>if they were coming home from school at<br>night ask them what did you find out<br>what did you learn<br>um and sort of have that conversation<br>with them<br>in a more standard you've gone to school<br>you're coming home way<br>but then if they're really struggling<br>then step back and again and and that's<br>the thing that i think is it's really<br>easy to say i do also have kids uh who<br>are on online school at the moment so<br>i i'm totally empathetic to this but<br>letting them have a go<br>making sure the structure is good<br>understanding<br>looking at those content materials then<br>they can learn<br>with that structure and then you can<br>step in to support them<br>but not necessarily a hundred percent<br>yeah and i should add that um in that<br>same study you were<br>talking about earlier with the video<br>chat book reading<br>um that they had another condition where<br>it was more like<br>uh just an e-book reading to the child<br>um without the um<br>adult support and children did still<br>learn from<br>exactly yes i forgot about that yeah<br>yeah so i think that's important to for<br>parents to know that um<br>that um ebooks are a great alternative<br>when you<br>can't be sitting beside them maybe an<br>alternative to some other<br>screen time they might be having which<br>sort of brings us to<br>the question that i know especially<br>parents of<br>older children and teenagers i get very<br>concerned about<br>i know that i got very concerned about<br>when my sons were adolescents<br>um playing video games uh that were not<br>uh well yeah they came a long way from<br>crash bandicoot you know so<br>um what do you recommend in terms of<br>in terms of content of the media that<br>children and teenagers are consuming<br>yeah so the thing is like<br>so we do know a lot about young kids<br>and we do know a lot like you know and<br>we know just i just want to follow up on<br>one other thing that you said that i've<br>gotten to say before which was<br>so things like sesame street is another<br>example of something that was really<br>well structured that has been<br>you know investigated for 30 years and<br>we know kids<br>who have this sort of educational media<br>diet<br>if you like to call it that if they've<br>been watching sesame street from early<br>in development<br>then this is later related to better<br>math performance better high school<br>performance more<br>uh wanting to read um and so that sort<br>of early<br>uh interest in education particularly<br>for families where there's not a lot of<br>other educational resources that was<br>sesame street was the most um effective<br>and so during this time of covert we<br>were kind of<br>all shut in that's also another thing to<br>think about that these programs can be<br>very<br>rich in their content if they're well<br>structured and well-developed as time<br>goes on as they get older<br>some of that content then moves to<br>video games and in those video games has<br>been really<br>interesting findings from video gamers<br>versus non-video gamers there's been<br>people who've been trained up on this<br>and i think the biggest surprising<br>finding<br>um is that visual processing<br>they are people who play video games<br>more even these first<br>person shooter games um you are more<br>likely<br>to have better peripheral vision uh<br>faster reaction time<br>um good sort of processing of details so<br>these were somewhat surprising findings<br>now then you're really thinking to<br>yourself i sort of i'm sure there's<br>eyebrows going up and thinking well all<br>of this violent content<br>and so we do know that violent content<br>um<br>can have negative effects on kids<br>negative effect on sleep<br>and um but the thing is<br>that now a lot of these games are<br>multi-platform games so you<br>get on a game with your friend and you<br>talk to your friend and you play with<br>your friend<br>and one of the recent findings is that<br>in those cases um that collaboration<br>that social collaboration<br>over the screen is really supportive it<br>reduces negative effects of violence<br>and um and you don't see any of those<br>sort of increases in aggression or any<br>of those other things that you might be<br>worried about<br>because they're engaging in this social<br>collaborative game<br>um similar findings with like uh six to<br>12 year olds definitely in minecraft<br>especially when they're creative in that<br>creative mode<br>um but even in survival mode when<br>they're interacting with each other<br>so what we're seeing even in older kids<br>is this social collaboration<br>is helping them um and then also that<br>there's sometimes these surprising<br>uh attentional gains that you wouldn't<br>necessarily have uh predicted<br>but um did that<br>yeah that's very reassuring um and i<br>again<br>i do love that finding uh um<br>just so the so the tip is to<br>try to get your teens to<br>collaborate and cooperate either say<br>with their siblings or with<br>their friends online and so it's all<br>about connection isn't it<br>um exactly exactly it's all about<br>connection<br>and and this is you we're seeing a theme<br>here right like this sort of how we use<br>the screens<br>um and how we connect with other people<br>via the screens<br>is is really important and and i wanted<br>to ask you<br>if you had other ideas of<br>um different ways that people might<br>connect<br>over video chat even sort of across<br>generations because i know<br>um the book was mentioned early on tell<br>me a story which is<br>a fanta i can say is a fantastic book i<br>always assign it for my students<br>um wonderful story about how<br>storytelling<br>happens across our children but i'm just<br>wondering do you have any other<br>suggestions of things that people could<br>do<br>via video chat in this time<br>i i'm really big on family stories and i<br>and i actually think that family stories<br>are even more important<br>right now because um in times of threat<br>and and covet is a time of threat we um<br>we need to connect with the people<br>closest to us<br>and one way uh one of the main ways we<br>do that<br>um well we have experiences with them<br>obviously but<br>we also tell stories about our<br>experiences<br>and share stories with each other about<br>um<br>things we've done together but also<br>grandparents can pass on<br>family history to grandchildren<br>um even some uh you know some<br>funny stories about when the parents<br>were<br>little and um<br>and kids of all ages love to hear<br>these family stories uh even teenagers<br>um love to hear these family stories um<br>so i do think that grandparents are a<br>real<br>undertapped resource in um<br>in making those connections and um in<br>strengthening those<br>bonds um and helping children learn<br>their family history<br>there's some fascinating research um<br>from my phd supervisor<br>robin fiveish who found that um<br>who found that kids who knew more of<br>their family history<br>these were nine to twelve-year-old kids<br>had better well-being<br>even after they controlled for other<br>factors that um that might contribute to<br>their well-being<br>so there there is something about these<br>family stories that<br>um that really helps center children i<br>think<br>that helps them realize where they come<br>from<br>and um and as they're teenagers<br>what kind of a person are they<br>are they coming to be um so i actually<br>created<br>um uh for national geographic family i<br>recently created<br>a card game for six to twelve-year-olds<br>about<br>um sharing family stories because i was<br>thinking<br>um oh it you know it's sort of boring if<br>you're doing a video chat<br>and your grandparent your grandmother<br>starts going on and on about<br>um what their parents were like when<br>they were little<br>uh so i created this car game and the<br>way it works it's called whose story is<br>it<br>and you just put a fact about um a<br>person<br>um in the family history um so the<br>example in the article<br>is um who had the nickname cannonball in<br>high school because he could throw<br>a baseball really hard at fast and um<br>and and you you get the kids to guess<br>who that was<br>and um and i made a version a low-tech<br>version on index cards<br>um and um and i think it's just a could<br>be a fun<br>interactive way for kids to learn about<br>their family histories<br>right and you could play it on something<br>like cahoots or um<br>any any sort of app that you asked us it<br>could be really fun<br>like the way that you could set it up<br>via the screen as well or even just with<br>the card game<br>itself um to be able to share those<br>stories<br>the other you know for a younger this<br>reminds me also for younger kids<br>um when grandparents are trying to<br>engage with the younger kids<br>playing games is another way to really<br>um<br>engage with them right because you said<br>card games and then i was just thinking<br>well<br>um we we sometimes think with video chat<br>all of us have to be sitting looking at<br>the screen and talking to each other and<br>totally engaged<br>and of course kids under five are not<br>going to want to do that right<br>and preschool teachers all know this um<br>and grandparents and parents really know<br>this and so we did the study where we<br>watched grandparents and<br>parents doing video chat with one<br>another and they came up with all these<br>really great<br>creative games um so they played<br>peek-a-boos some people<br>um grandparents had kids go off and get<br>scavenger hunts<br>um they did which i thought was a<br>brilliant one<br>um they read books to them um<br>they had meals together snacks together<br>so sort of ways of just<br>sharing over video chat as well so<br>sharing family history<br>sharing family meals um back and forth<br>is another way of staying uh connected<br>and you can try it out in<br>all uh different ages and some other i'm<br>i'm just thinking about this<br>with my friend who had this two-year-old<br>and um i've told this story so many<br>times now but it was so great this<br>little two-year-old<br>he really loved matchbox cars and<br>my kids really my son really loved<br>matchbox cards as well so we got out all<br>of our old ones<br>um he got out his and then this little<br>two-year-old said okay so we'll have a<br>race<br>bear in mind that we're on an other side<br>different sides of a screen at this<br>point right<br>i said sure we'll have a race and so we<br>had a race<br>and um the sweet boy says okay you won<br>that time<br>right and he says let's have another<br>race<br>and the second place he actually won so<br>that was that was lucky it sort of<br>worked out<br>but like people are really i think this<br>is this is part of the sort of<br>connection<br>at this time that people are really<br>creative kids are really creative<br>uh grandparents are able to share really<br>great information and games and<br>ideas like this scavenger hunt i would<br>never have thought of<br>but all of these grandparents were<br>saying yeah it's a great game to play<br>with your grandkids<br>they go off and stuff and they bring it<br>back and so<br>i think there's really creative ways of<br>sharing the screen<br>um especially at the time i'm<br>curious about the app radio um<br>for grandparents uh which um<br>gets around sort of the logistical<br>problems of sharing a book over video<br>chat<br>and um they have over<br>200 titles and and the book appears on<br>the screen so that<br>um and then the child can actually help<br>turn the pages and things like that<br>well that's really cool yeah<br>so there's so there's really clever apps<br>um and and clever designers out there<br>and sort of<br>part of it is you know talking with your<br>friends figuring out what those good<br>ones are but<br>um but yeah that sounds like a really<br>great one<br>and if you don't if you can't find the<br>app then just<br>having the same book in that in both<br>houses can also help<br>um sometimes you can't find the good<br>time like we've managed to find the one<br>overlap between new zealand<br>uh and the east coast at the moment<br>right<br>but also recording stuff for a child<br>um so that again they can watch that<br>over and over that<br>there's been there was a lot of work<br>with military um<br>where families were separated and<br>parents would read books and record them<br>and then the children could watch them<br>with the book in front of them and that<br>really helped them sort of stay<br>connected especially if<br>they couldn't make the video chat time<br>so<br>i think people are really clever and<br>creative and<br>and maybe discussion time will hear some<br>other um<br>good ideas from people as well um but<br>maybe now is a good time<br>for us to open up for for some questions<br>from people<br>just as a as a funny reminder to<br>everyone who started live<br>feel free to jump into the q a box if<br>you have a question<br>uh just feel free to type it in and we<br>can we can ask it<br>um but uh john and i can get things<br>kicked off<br>uh uh rachel i i do want to<br>press on the content question a little<br>bit uh more<br>you mentioned uh when elaine asked you<br>about the content<br>uh how that changes you know and then<br>you sort of<br>um talked about well is this about the<br>importance of content but more about the<br>sort of how like the collaboration<br>element of the video game so<br>if you hold the collaboration elements<br>consistent like equal<br>how does content change the outcome of<br>the learning so it's it's<br>it's like a problem so for example you<br>know i have to convince i was a gamer<br>growing up<br>uh first person shooter games versus<br>real-time strategy<br>uh versus puzzle solving and things like<br>that does that actually change the<br>outcome of the learning<br>well it does because you know because<br>our brains are sort of ready to<br>to learn the different types of<br>information right and so it's gonna<br>transfer different types of information<br>um<br>and and the the media platform doesn't<br>really change that<br>like what you're gonna get from<br>different uh things<br>the dimension that does change um the<br>reason i<br>sort of focused in on these action games<br>was that it was surprising that that was<br>really changing people's<br>uh perception and across reasonable<br>amounts of time that was sort of a long<br>lasting<br>effect improved peripheral vision for<br>example<br>um but these these strategy games i mean<br>i'm going to show my age now but if you<br>remember the game people used to play<br>dungeons and dragons um and initially<br>they played that<br>um and with each other instead of with<br>pieces game pieces and so on<br>and then that that type of program that<br>strategy game moved into<br>the gaming world as well so i think that<br>the the platform itself<br>is as long as you are allowing for the<br>different affordances of it or the way<br>that it works<br>then that's not necessarily going to<br>increase that's not necessarily going to<br>diminish what you can learn from those<br>strategy games<br>as long as it's set up properly right so<br>long as<br>everybody can um interact around that<br>game piece<br>and the same thing but but in terms of<br>what kids can learn from educational<br>media<br>i think that's a slightly different<br>question<br>so for television educational television<br>that again the structure is really<br>really important so<br>um you can i had meant to mention this<br>before<br>but there's a couple of websites that i<br>think are really useful<br>um one is common sense media and common<br>sense media has got<br>uh various different ages and you can<br>put in the age of the child and look at<br>various<br>different dimensions about the content<br>and parent ratings and descriptions and<br>so on<br>that's very very useful because part of<br>it is narrowing down that universe of<br>what to choose<br>um pbs kids is another really great<br>site and the reason for this is that<br>these characters are really important<br>for kids to learn from they can take<br>that character<br>learn information around them that's one<br>of the other really powerful things<br>about book reading<br>but the nice thing about pbs kids is<br>that you've got the video content<br>and then you've got the games so like<br>daniel tiger which is<br>is basically the fred rogers show turned<br>into animation<br>it's great it's got stories and games<br>and everything else<br>you can have the show and then you can<br>have the characters there<br>so it's so it that piece does take a<br>little bit of work from the<br>from up front but narrowing it down by<br>common sense media or pbs<br>kids um those platforms kind of help you<br>go into the universe where and um the<br>other one<br>is as noggin has got some good content<br>and good development as well<br>there's a lot of of the the difficulty<br>for parents<br>is in in my view in terms of thinking<br>about that content<br>is that there are tons and tons of<br>things<br>out there that have not been well<br>validated or well researched or well<br>thought through<br>and so trying to narrow down that<br>universe by both thinking<br>you know looking for the content on<br>these few websites<br>and then watching it yourself and saying<br>is that something that my kid really<br>likes<br>so you might have a child who loves<br>going to the zoo<br>so like the national zoo at the moment<br>has got a<br>webcam on the little panda and that<br>might be something that your child<br>loves to go and see my children not so<br>much they're not<br>very pet or animal oriented<br>so they would rather go um<br>to a cooking website or a cooking show<br>and learn how to do that so thinking<br>about your<br>child their interests thinking about the<br>way that that<br>content has been uh developed and sort<br>of vetting that<br>and then trying to come in and sort of<br>share that experience with them not 24 7<br>but share it with them so that they're<br>actively engaged<br>and interested in it those are kind of<br>the ingredients here<br>they're called the three c's the child<br>the content and the context<br>um and so solving those three c's for<br>your individual child is<br>is the key so does that kind of push<br>back a little bit on that content<br>question<br>question there and i can i can for kids<br>under three there's these resources also<br>zero to three has got screen sense<br>resources<br>as well we can share all these<br>afterwards too<br>hey um i've got a question uh you know<br>i've got<br>three teenagers at home in a 10 year old<br>and<br>they're consuming a lot of content and<br>you type of outlined at the start<br>it's kind of like not all content you<br>know you've got to look at the quality<br>of the content and the purpose and all<br>the rest and it runs the full gamut of<br>youtube videos um tik tok<br>instagram all the way through to all<br>those great collaboration games<br>where um you know they're on minecraft<br>and fortnite and<br>they've got a discord channel so they're<br>talking to somebody in different<br>different places whether or not it's<br>upstairs in the house or in different<br>cities<br>um one of the things we're finding is<br>that uh<br>the kids spend a lot of time so they<br>switch from one which is<br>from one type of screen which could be<br>mindlessly scrolling through<br>uh tiktok or instagram which i don't<br>necessarily<br>value highly or think it's necessarily<br>um<br>great for the kids to do to then swing<br>into hey guys let's get<br>let's get together and play these um<br>collaboration games<br>so my question is you know how how do we<br>go about um encouraging some<br>self-policing<br>that you know that these teenagers you<br>know beyond toddlers<br>um you know how do we encourage them to<br>self-police their own<br>video consumption or screen consumption<br>yeah so turning off is the hardest thing<br>right and especially now when you can't<br>go out and play<br>with your friends um so the american<br>academy of pediatrics<br>has come up with these media plan guides<br>for families and essentially what it is<br>is it's a series of questions that you<br>can go through with your teenager<br>and you it's it's a negotiation but you<br>sort of negotiate various different<br>points like<br>what times of the day would i be able to<br>do this um<br>what sort of content would i be<br>interested in doing<br>when am i gonna ask you or talk to you<br>about things like so<br>there's different you know and because<br>and also just a little bit of discussion<br>about uh safety online right because<br>there's a lot of predatory stuff<br>online as well so can do i have to ask<br>before i download an app<br>uh what is what are privacy settings and<br>really do i<br>just click accept or should i be<br>thinking about some of those things and<br>those sort of more nefarious practices<br>where<br>um what they'll do is they'll say to the<br>kid you know you have to come on<br>tomorrow at three o'clock in the<br>afternoon<br>and if you're at three o'clock in the<br>afternoon you'll get 20 gems<br>if you're not on at three o'clock you're<br>gonna miss out on those gems<br>it doesn't matter that they're virtual<br>and that they're not actually real<br>things<br>they want to go on at three and the the<br>point of the app developer is to keep<br>them on for longer right<br>so those are the types of things that<br>you want to be<br>asking about and talking about with them<br>um and then this media plan this is<br>american academy of pediatrics it's got<br>this media plan<br>that kind of just helps walk through<br>some of those discussions<br>and then they will come up with time and<br>questions and amounts and so on<br>and that's a plan it's an agreement and<br>then you come back to it because<br>it doesn't work and in and when we get<br>the vaccine i'm just saying when<br>um obviously that's also going to be a<br>huge shift for children to move<br>out of the screen world entirely back<br>into a more real world and so<br>also as you if you've got that plan now<br>you can also then come back to it and<br>revisit it nearer<br>the time again i have got young children<br>i know that this is not a perfect system<br>that it's it's not possible to do all of<br>these other things but this does allow<br>them<br>to sort of have some buy-in rather than<br>it<br>just being okay these are the rules and<br>it's going to go off<br>um or you're going to have to only do<br>two hours because if you<br>say to them you can have two hours they<br>will go up to one minute 59<br>uh seconds right they're gonna go to<br>that two hours<br>if you say to them and this is what the<br>media plan does<br>it says what do you need to do get done<br>today<br>okay i need to sleep let's build that in<br>first<br>i need to have some food let's build<br>that in unfortunately to go to school<br>i have to talk to my friends i have to<br>get a bit of exercise um<br>and then when is the time left over that<br>i would build in my media so rather than<br>saying<br>today you have three hours of media<br>every day<br>it flips it around to say well what do<br>you want to get out of your day<br>and as they're teenagers they're<br>starting to think about all these things<br>and it's just a different way of<br>orienting it<br>again just back to that very first<br>question it's not about screen time per<br>se<br>it's about what are you doing so if they<br>say yeah i just want to have a video<br>chat with my friends for an hour this<br>afternoon<br>and we're all going to do a puzzle or<br>something ridiculous like they come up<br>i've them you know go on youtube to<br>learn how to do origami or like<br>they come up with all these different<br>things that's fine because they're<br>actually doing stuff<br>and they're doing stuff together if they<br>say i want to spend three hours today on<br>instagram<br>and tick-tock combined or alternate<br>between them<br>you say well maybe there's other things<br>that you can think about let's go back<br>to the plan<br>so it's more about what they're going to<br>get out of the day so that's a very long<br>answer the short answer is the aap media<br>plan is a great<br>place to start conversation<br>um i have a question from the from the<br>audience uh this is from<br>from seth um i am working with a student<br>doing fully virtual kindergarten<br>the child has never met any of the<br>people in their class and don't seem to<br>interact with their classmates<br>much if at all could you speak to how uh<br>could you speak about how<br>the important parts of social<br>peer-to-peer dimensions of primary<br>that's a tough one do you want to start<br>uh<br>i couldn't hear the last part of the<br>question could you just repeat it<br>uh yeah of course the last part of the<br>question is is could you speak to<br>how important parts of the social<br>peer-to-peer dimension<br>of primary school can be supported<br>virtually<br>and i don't have young children who are<br>on online schooling<br>so i don't have any practical experience<br>but um<br>but one point that i wanted to to make<br>about<br>their peer relationships right now<br>is that um is that those relationships<br>with media characters and book<br>characters<br>are what we call parasocial<br>relationships<br>that can actually serve some many of the<br>same functions<br>as their real friends um and can help<br>keep them from<br>feeling lonely and so the more<br>obviously we need to be supporting<br>video chats and other ways to connect<br>with their real friends<br>but also be thinking about these<br>parasocial relationships they have in<br>this time they<br>they are serving a really important<br>function<br>yeah there's and and it turns out like<br>these para social relationships sort of<br>they<br>end up showing empathy they develop them<br>across time they learn these characters<br>and all of us probably have a<br>remembrance of a favorite childhood<br>character from a book or so one<br>possibility then in that kindergarten<br>setting is like<br>is there a shared book reading and then<br>that they can talk about their favorite<br>character and<br>often times there's going to be and and<br>if if if i'm speaking with a<br>kindergarten teacher you know<br>like there are different characters that<br>are kind of<br>lots of kids really like and then there<br>is a starting point for a conversation<br>where you haven't got a real thing in<br>front of you but<br>if you both really love elmo or you both<br>really love thomas the tank engine<br>then that can sort of start a<br>conversation in those smaller peer<br>groups<br>um and it's starting from a point of<br>expertise the kid<br>knows if if your child watched thomas<br>tank engine which my child did<br>you know all of those different<br>characters and who they're friends with<br>and<br>why somebody is unhappy and why they're<br>happy and so that can be a really nice<br>starting point for a conversation to<br>sort of invite that<br>that child in as well and all of the<br>basic dialergic<br>read reading practices um can also be a<br>way to invite<br>uh invite that child in some people have<br>found<br>that breakout rooms can be helpful but<br>then you say have to<br>a monitor in every breakout room and i'm<br>not sure<br>any kindergarten school has got enough<br>resources to to do that<br>um but the other thing that some people<br>have recommended is also maybe<br>trying to meet with smaller groups um<br>one at a time<br>so that those peer relationships it's<br>easier to form rather than a big screen<br>a big zoom screen so if you can say okay<br>well we're just going to stay the last<br>five minutes<br>these three kids are going to stay and<br>we're just going to have a conversation<br>ourselves<br>this has been something in video chat<br>research we're sort of breaking up<br>when there's been difficulties in uh<br>foster care for example and there's<br>mobile siblings and multiple families<br>all trying to connect<br>having a little bit of time one-on-one<br>or small groups can be quite<br>helpful for kids in that virtual space<br>so those would be<br>possible things that hopefully help<br>that's really helpful<br>um there's another question here about<br>engagement from<br>ebooks translating to print books but i<br>might take the liberty to expand that<br>question a little further which is<br>um rachel you mentioned when we get a<br>vaccine right it will move back from<br>virtual to real world um has there been<br>have you come across any research<br>or have you done any research about that<br>transfer from<br>going from a virtual environment to a<br>real world environment and learning so<br>will you know will the virtual<br>environment uh today for learning<br>create any disadvantages when we move<br>yeah that's a really good question so i<br>think<br>um one of the things that we do know<br>about transfer learning<br>is that it's hard right i made that<br>really dramatic point<br>but what we also know is that connecting<br>the dots is really important<br>so for example kids are in the virtual<br>world at the moment<br>um and here in dc we're moving to four<br>and all of the leaves are about to<br>change and normally if you were in<br>school<br>you would be getting those leaves and<br>you'd be doing those<br>leaf images and all the rest of it and<br>what the challenge is going to be for<br>teachers and for families<br>is sort of making connecting those dots<br>so that they do go outside and pick up<br>the<br>the leaf from outside when they're<br>learning about the life cycle on the<br>virtual world so we don't want to wait<br>until we're transitioning back<br>um but with any sort of media and maybe<br>this is going to be a boon<br>of this this age is helping kids connect<br>the two worlds and really making it<br>explicit to them<br>that this this this zoom thing that<br>you're going to it actually means<br>something it's something important<br>for your life so when your teacher talks<br>to you about<br>photosynthesis or whatever then you go<br>out and you get the green leaf and you<br>look up at the sun and<br>help them connect those dots back and<br>forth because that connection is the<br>thing that's hardest for them and that's<br>the thing that<br>that caregivers are brilliant at doing<br>even without thinking about it um and<br>that's also one of those things that we<br>really know from picture books that that<br>connecting the dots<br>connecting those worlds together with<br>language and with experience<br>is really what helps the kids in their<br>language and literacy and helps the kids<br>learn anything from media so i would say<br>we don't want to wait<br>until we get the vaccine we want to be<br>trying to connect those dots<br>all the time between the media and the<br>real world and that's for everybody<br>you know for college students that i'm<br>teaching at the moment hard for them<br>to say well why do we really care um<br>and so they have to go off and do<br>assignments that connect the dots as<br>well<br>i've got another question um so you've<br>given us huge amount of<br>guidance around what we what we should<br>be doing as parents to<br>help our children um navigate this this<br>new world<br>is is there anything that we you know as<br>parents we should not be doing is<br>there some things that um just don't do<br>because it backfires or doesn't doesn't<br>lead to the right results i mean is<br>there any<br>thing you can provide there so there is<br>one thing<br>but i don't like this one nobody and<br>nobody is a parent or something like<br>this one<br>um so it's called technoference so we<br>can<br>actually quite easily disrupt<br>connections uh between<br>ourselves and other people by our own<br>media use um<br>so uh for example um<br>i don't have my cell phone here which is<br>almost unreal but if anybody wants to<br>just pick up<br>can one of can you just do you have your<br>cell phone yet there<br>okay just just take a look at your cell<br>phone there jono<br>okay look at jono's face can never can<br>anybody you might need to speak so that<br>we can<br>everybody else can see he's now got a<br>flat<br>face and as soon as and really try to<br>get absorbed in that content jono<br>because what then what happens<br>is when i ask you a question you're<br>going to respond slower<br>okay because jono could i just have your<br>attention please<br>could i have your attention please hello<br>and so with young kids um<br>and with older kids you'll see this as<br>well so they did this study in a<br>restaurant where<br>um they just observed people um in the<br>restaurant and they were using their<br>phones or not<br>and at a certain point in time kids got<br>kind of frustrated<br>that they couldn't get their parents<br>attention never mind the fact that we<br>get frustrated with them when we can't<br>get their attention from the phone it<br>kind of works in both directions<br>so if so one thing that i would say<br>there's two things i would say we<br>shouldn't do one<br>if at all possible protect meal times<br>from screens<br>so try to put screens down during meal<br>times<br>the second thing i would say is sort of<br>protect<br>sleep and so um you might want to buffer<br>between because and it's not necessarily<br>to do with the blue light<br>it's not necessarily to do with uh but<br>it's more to do with sort of over<br>stimulation and creating that boundary<br>before the end of the day and going to<br>sleep so if you can create<br>a screen free time for your child<br>between the end of the day and then<br>falling asleep they're more likely to<br>fall asleep more easily and you're<br>protecting sleep<br>and then keeping that screen if you have<br>like a place<br>to keep it in your house so that's also<br>very hard especially with teenagers but<br>if you say okay<br>you have to plug your screen in um down<br>in the kitchen overnight in if you can<br>do any of those things you're doing<br>great they protect mealtimes and protect<br>sleep<br>would be the things that i would say you<br>really want to try and do uh in order to<br>reduce negative effects<br>and just plain old really graphic<br>violent<br>stuff don't watch that either that's<br>that's not gonna<br>that that just doesn't help anybody<br>interferes with sleep creates nightmares<br>help is and isn't helpful to kids of of<br>any ages<br>really really violent uh media 2000<br>studies so we kind of<br>know the answer to that one so those<br>would be the<br>don'ts<br>okay thank you so much um so i want to<br>be respectful of everyone's time<br>uh we are at the top of the hour and uh<br>just<br>wanna again say huge thank you to elaine<br>and rachel<br>uh for joining us today and providing us<br>with your expertise<br>this has been super insightful for me<br>personally as a parent and i'm sure<br>those watching uh would agree um
