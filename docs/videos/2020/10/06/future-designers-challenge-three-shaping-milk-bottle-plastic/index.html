plastic is made from high<br>density polyethylene<br>and it's a thermoformed plastic so there<br>are two types of plastic<br>thermoform and thermoset thermoform<br>plastic means you can keep re-melting<br>and reshaping it<br>and thermoset plastic once it's set in<br>place you can't<br>re-melt it so this is a really good one<br>if you want to do things at home<br>and because you can remount it the milk<br>bottle caps which are colored you can<br>also re-melt<br>but we're just going to look at this<br>plastic today because it's translucent<br>so you can control light quality through<br>it<br>so we're just going to start off by<br>cutting out some of the flat surfaces<br>from the plastic<br>you can also use the actual form for<br>creating curves but we'll just start off<br>if you want to check out how to use your<br>knife and your scissors<br>then check out our knife skills video<br>so i'm just going to start off by<br>cutting a layer<br>and i'm not going to be worried about<br>making it particularly straight i'm just<br>freehunting it but remember<br>i'm never cutting towards my fingers<br>so that's a really good way to cut your<br>fingers<br>i'm just going to take my scissors<br>because that's an easier way to get in<br>there<br>sometimes<br>once you've got your plastic cut um you<br>might want to think about what you're<br>going to do with your light but if<br>you're just wanting to experiment with<br>the plastic you can start off even at<br>this stage<br>i'm going to cut mine into little strips<br>a few thin strips so we can look at what<br>those do and a few better bits so we can<br>okay make sure you put your knives into<br>a safe spot<br>and i'm just going to clear this off to<br>form the plastic or melt it you can heat<br>it up in a whole lot of different ways<br>i'm going to use an iron today that's<br>nice and controllable and it's something<br>everyone tends to have<br>on now if you're using an iron or a<br>sandwich brush the last thing you want<br>to do is put the plastic straight onto<br>it because it'll melt on and stick<br>so we're going to just use some baking<br>paper<br>and we're going to sandwich the plastic<br>between two sheets of baking paper so it<br>doesn't<br>attach to the fabric or the ironing<br>board underneath<br>now i also have some gloves here and<br>that's because the plastic gets quite<br>hot and it can be a little bit too hot<br>to touch so i'm just protecting my hands<br>just with some normal gloves<br>gardening gloves would work gloves for<br>warmth<br>ski gloves might be a little bit too<br>thick<br>okay so i'm going to just start with one<br>of these big bits to show you a little<br>bit about what happens when you're<br>okay so i've got my plastic here<br>sandwiched between my baking paper<br>and then i just run the iron over it and<br>as i run the iron over<br>there are a couple things that will<br>happen baking paper will begin to move a<br>little bit less<br>and the plastic will start becoming more<br>translucent so you know when it's gotten<br>really soft<br>when it's completely translucent so what<br>i like to do is get it<br>quite translucent all the way and so<br>then when i<br>pick it up you can sort of see it's<br>really attached to the baking paper<br>now if i try and play with it at this<br>stage it's so<br>soft it's quite hard to form and it will<br>begin to stretch a little bit<br>so i just like to wait until it's a<br>little bit white again<br>and then you can pull off that plastic<br>coming off the paper<br>and you can start twisting or bending or<br>shaping it<br>into whatever form you want so that's<br>kind of a scramble form<br>and that's nice and easy to<br>do quickly you can also do things like<br>weaving<br>uh the plastic together and getting<br>so if i take some of these strips that<br>i've made<br>and i lay them in a woven pattern<br>they're just an over under over under<br>very simple one<br>paper over the top now these are going<br>to stick together a little bit like blue<br>so you just want to make sure that<br>you're um<br>making sure it's all lined up in the way<br>you want before you put the iron on<br>because once it's stuck together it's<br>this is a bit of a bigger surface so<br>when you're going across a bigger<br>surface<br>it can take a bit longer to heat up and<br>you'll notice with something like this<br>that certain points of it heat up before<br>others because you've got double layers<br>of plastic so it can take longer for the<br>then i can open it up and you can see<br>that that's become<br>one one piece<br>so you can see here that it's gotten<br>stuck together<br>you might want to wait for it to get a<br>little bit cooler before you take it off<br>but it also shows you how you can start<br>shaping<br>and attack reattaching parts if you want<br>even thicker layers to reform<br>and you can fold the plastic around<br>you can start going on diagonals to get<br>more complex<br>patterns<br>the other thing that you can do is use<br>it to build a bit of<br>shape now this one i'm going to use the<br>iron upside down<br>so you want to make sure you're going to<br>top it up with materials that aren't<br>going to burn<br>and you've got to be really careful not<br>to burn yourself it's something i would<br>recommend<br>um having one of your parents or someone<br>double check it before you start and a<br>little bit more support would probably<br>be a good idea<br>and then i take a piece of the um<br>baking paper and i just put that over<br>the top now i might secure this with a<br>little bit of masking tape or something<br>just to hold it there okay so i'm just<br>putting on<br>a sheet of plastic there that i'm going<br>to wait until it gets quite<br>deep and it's already beginning to stick<br>to the<br>to the baking paper a bit and that's<br>heating up and it's going to begin to<br>turn a bit translucent<br>now if i want to create more 3d forms i<br>can then build onto this and melt<br>pieces of plastic together so i can use<br>this bit of plastic<br>and push it into that other one and just<br>wait<br>until they nail and as you just like<br>before the bits that are melting are<br>becoming more translucent<br>and so when that top layer is becoming<br>translucent too you know it's actually<br>taken form<br>and i'm going to take that off<br>and let it cool and you can see we're<br>taking taken<br>and began to create a 3d form which you<br>can then curve and add more shape to if<br>you want<br>now what's nice here is that you're<br>getting further and further away from<br>the milk bottle you're not seeing this<br>and going oh<br>that's a milk bottle and i'll show you<br>how that can begin to<br>affect light so once you've started<br>playing with your<br>inner body plastic and you've started<br>making the forms you really want to see<br>what kind of effect it has on different<br>lights so<br>this one here is just a sort of a mess<br>of squiggly<br>milk bottle plastic but then when you<br>start putting light underneath<br>it uh it has different effects and a<br>cool white light is going to look and<br>feel really different<br>from a brighter coming from a warmer<br>softer light like this one here these<br>would be<br>uh accent lights so little sparkle<br>lights in the corner of your room<br>but you don't have to have that for um<br>using the bottom cluster you can do<br>larger lights or task lights as well<br>so here this was another one that we<br>and when we put the light through it<br>because it's a bit translucent<br>the light will actually capture itself<br>inside the plastic<br>and bounce off and illuminate it<br>slightly<br>we hope this video has given you some<br>ideas of how to use milk bottle plastic<br>so good luck with the challenge and we<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
