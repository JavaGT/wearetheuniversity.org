Chair in the Economics of Disasters in Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington's School of Economics and Finance, Professor Ilan Noy’s research is calculating the cost of climate change and looking at how we can prevent, prepare for and mitigate its economic impacts.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>So I'm a professor in economics, and I've been <br>focusing on disasters of the natural kind<br>and on climate change.<br>I focus on the economic impact of disasters<br>and disasters of say earthquakes or COVID-19<br>and weather disasters like <br>floods or storms or droughts.<br>So these events are becoming more intense<br>and therefore more damaging to the economy.<br>Quantification is important because<br>policy needs to respond to numbers.<br>So when a policymaker decides okay <br>is it worthwhile to spend x amount of dollars<br>preventing this type of thing,<br>is it worthwhile to do it?<br>Then we need to understand<br>what happens if we don't do it<br>and we need to quantify<br>what happens when we don't do it.<br>But the big issue is that the <br>countries that will suffer the most<br>are the ones that are <br>least able to spend on mitigation<br>to spend on prevention,<br>and to spend on recovery.<br>Their emissions are only<br>a small part of global emissions. <br>And they don't want to reduce them <br>because they also want not to stay poor.<br>In our region the most<br>notorious example is Jakarta.<br>Where Jakarta is lower than sea <br>level, and flooding is increasing.  <br>The president is suggesting, or planning<br>to move the capital from Jakarta<br>to some other place that <br>is safer for flooding.<br>This is specifically, I <br>think, for that reason. <br>Now, of course the price tag <br>on that is humongous.<br>They're talking about <br>tens of billions of dollars.<br>That's an example of the<br>cost of climate change.<br>It's much better to prevent <br>than to deal with the aftermath.<br>Some properties on coasts are going to <br>become first uninsurable and eventually untenable. <br>Will they just lose their property?<br>Does the government provide insurance<br>for flooding, for example?<br>Because the private sector now perceives the risk<br>to be too high and does not want to insure any more.<br>Politically, it's more difficult to convince a community <br>that they need to retreat from the coast a bit. <br>Although the cost of this for a country<br>like New Zealand is not insurmountable .<br>It's significantly less than say, what it <br>cost us to deal with the Canterbury earthquakes.<br>We've done a huge retreat in Christchurch,<br>in the red zone. <br>Where we basically told 20,000 people<br>that they can no longer go back to their house,<br>and that they need to go somewhere else.<br>And the government compensated them for that.<br>We don't have an equivalent to that<br>in the climate change space.<br>So how do we pay for these things, and how much <br>should it cost, and what is the right time profile?<br>Is it better to invest today in these things? <br>Or is it better to wait maybe for a big event?<br>Within a few years, we'll already live in a world<br>in which some communities will not <br>be able to purchase flood insurance.<br>I think uninsurability is a risk that is much closer,<br>in terms of the horizon, than 50 years.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
