Our Parliamentary Internship course (POLS 428) gives postgraduate political science students the opportunity to go behind the scenes and work closely with an MP.<br><br>Master of Political Science student Bonnie Hayvice was an intern for Green Party MP Chlöe Swarbrick. In this video, Bonnie and Chlöe share their experiences of the Parliamentary Internship. <br><br>Find out more about postgraduate studies in Political Science: http://bit.ly/pg-political-science or about the course: http://bit.ly/parliament-internships</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Chlöe: Stephen Levine rolled into my office <br>and asked me if I wanted an intern and I was  <br>like absolutely. I would love to work with a <br>student from Victoria University of Wellington.<br>Bonnie: I kind of assumed coming into <br>this that I might be the person  <br>going and getting coffee for Chlöe <br>but I haven't done that once.<br>Chlöe: Yeah Bonnie has done a heap <br>of amount of, like so many things.<br>Bonnie: I've worked on a lot of <br>different things during this internship.<br>Chlöe: Bonnie has tried her <br>hand at writing press releases.<br>Bonnie: Drafted terms of reference for <br>the inquiry into student accommodation.<br>Chlöe: She has captioned a bunch of my videos.<br>Bonnie: I've also helped draft responses for <br>different submissions and emails to ministers.<br>Chlöe: She's done a bunch of research.<br>Bonnie: Done her podcast.<br>Chlöe: and has been an invaluable <br>resource to that effect.<br>Bonnie: So it's a real like <br>different array of things.<br>Chlöe: She's got very hands-on and very practical  <br>in how we run this office, which <br>is cool. It's the perfect vibe.<br>Bonnie: But there's also the whole <br>other side of the internship where  <br>you get to observe the political processes<br> happening right in front of you  <br>and you sort of just get to see how that <br>plays out and really what the day in the  <br>life of MP is and the decision-making <br>processes that affect all of us.<br>Chlöe: I would hope that the <br>experience of an intern is  <br>to see just how wild parliament really is<br>Bonnie: For me, it's a complete no-brainer to <br>study politics in the city where it's happening.  <br>I knew that taking this course I would <br>get a completely different look into  <br>the world of politics that you <br>can't find in a lecture theatre.<br>Chlöe: The opportunity to become <br>somebody in a role like an intern  <br>enables you to figure out who <br>you are within the confines, or  <br>bounds, of a position in parliament that <br>is literally whatever you want to make it.<br>Bonnie: It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity <br>to get a behind-the-scenes look at how  <br>MPs work and what happens here in parliament.<br>Chlöe: I think as a member of parliament,  <br>it's been a massive privilege to have the <br>opportunity to work with an intern because  <br>of the passion, energy, and different <br>perspective that's brought into the office.<br>Bonnie: I'm not sure in exactly what capacity <br>but working for Chlöe and the Greens has made  <br>me really want to help create policy which helps <br>all kinds of New Zealanders, particularly our most  <br>vulnerable people, so whether that's working <br>in a government department and working on  <br>policy that could help that or being a politician <br>myself, I don't know but yeah it's very exciting.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
