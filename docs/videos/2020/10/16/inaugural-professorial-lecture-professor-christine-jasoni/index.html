Christine’s research interest is in how the brain forms before we are born, with a particular focus on understanding how a mother’s health during this critical period of life can impact the unborn baby’s brain; and increase neurological disease risk.<br><br><br>Her group’s work has been published in some of the top international journals, and her trainees have gone on to prestigious positions nationally and abroad. Christine’s laboratory is situated in the Centre for Neuroendocrinology, among a group of researchers who are world-leaders in discovering how the brain controls some of our most essential bodily functions. Christine’s reach into the neuroscience community at Otago, however, is much broader. She is the Director of the 300-researcher-strong Brain Health Research Centre, is a former Director of the Neuroscience Degree Programme, and has won numerous awards for her neuroscience

everyone<br>my name is harleen hayne and i'm the<br>vice chancellor here at the university<br>of otago<br>and it gives me great pleasure to<br>welcome you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor<br>christine josoni<br>on behalf of the university i would like<br>to begin by extending a particularly<br>warm welcome to christine's partner<br>andrew who is here with us this evening<br>and in addition to andrew i would also<br>like to welcome christine's parents<br>gordon and marilyn josonne who are<br>watching us remotely<br>from pengrove california<br>and there's more her brother<br>richard who is watching remotely from<br>reno nevada<br>i'd also like to extend a warm welcome<br>to all of the staff<br>and students who are here this evening<br>and members of the wider dunedin<br>community<br>and i would like to extend a<br>particularly warm welcome to our<br>chancellor who always makes time in his<br>very busy schedule to<br>take part in these very important<br>occasions<br>so whether you are here in person or you<br>are visiting us<br>um from somewhere else in the world um<br>no my heart am i welcome<br>now these lectures are always a time for<br>huge celebration for the university<br>community and i'm delighted to see so<br>many people who are here with us this<br>evening to<br>come together to celebrate this really<br>important milestone<br>in christine's career now as you will<br>learn from her lecture this evening<br>professor josoni is an inspiring and<br>award-winning<br>teacher and postgraduate supervisor<br>she is also a successful and very<br>well-funded researcher<br>she's provided exceptional service to<br>her discipline<br>her department and to this university<br>now when we consider applications<br>for promotion to professor we seek the<br>views<br>of internationally recognized experts<br>in the applicant's area of research<br>now as you might expect when we sought<br>this kind of feedback<br>regarding christine's potential<br>promotion<br>her referees were uniformly glowing<br>in fact one of her referees was so<br>supportive of this promotion that rather<br>than ticking the box<br>i strongly recommend the applicant for<br>promotion to professor<br>they made their own category i super<br>strongly recommend the applicant for<br>promotion to professor so on the basis<br>of a presentation this evening i'm sure<br>that you will all<br>understand why christine on behalf of<br>the university of otago i would like to<br>warmly congratulate you<br>on your very very well deserved<br>promotion to professor i am<br>very much looking forward to your<br>lecture this evening<br>i will now call on professor brian<br>highland who will tell us just a little<br>bit more about christine's academic<br>journey to professor<br>noreda tenacotto tennacotto tenetato<br>katoa<br>thank you vice chancellor it's indeed my<br>great pleasure to<br>have the role to introduce the speaker<br>greetings to you all um so christine<br>is just to summarize really and expand a<br>little bit on on some things that the<br>vice chancellor has already pointed out<br>to you<br>um christine completed her undergraduate<br>training<br>in in the united states university of<br>california with<br>bachelor laws degrees in<br>biology and mathematics and then a phd<br>at the university of washington<br>in 1994. so then pursued the sort of<br>traditional postdoctoral<br>route that um that most phd candidates<br>will follow for a couple of years<br>at the university of washington and the<br>department of biological structure<br>she then did a slight sideways trip um<br>we we might jokingly refer to going to<br>the other side<br>in that she joined became lead<br>investigator for<br>in in industry in<br>genome diagnostics rosetta informatics<br>at the freda hutchinson cancer research<br>center in seattle washington<br>she was there till 2001 and then she<br>relocated to new zealand in new zealand<br>she picked up a position<br>as the head of bioinformatics at pacific<br>edge biotechnology<br>and from there we attracted it back into<br>academia to<br>our benefit and perhaps not necessarily<br>to industries loss because we now know<br>although we jokingly talk about going to<br>the other side<br>in fact industry and academia are<br>together<br>on a on a a task to bring<br>improvement to the world through better<br>understanding and application of<br>scientific understanding<br>in the real world so 2002 as i said she<br>became a welcome<br>trust research fellow in the department<br>of physiology in the center for<br>neuroendocrinology<br>here at otago then in 2008<br>after working in that group and<br>publishing a series of very<br>important and high impact papers she won<br>a position as<br>lecturer at the department of anatomy<br>here at<br>in the school of biomedical sciences at<br>the university of otago<br>and has worked her way through the ranks<br>and as again the vice chancellor said<br>with great achievement on the way<br>to promotion to associate professor in<br>2015<br>and finally today we're welcoming her to<br>the ranks<br>of professors at the university<br>so as again has been pointed out and<br>just to reiterate<br>promotion to professor requires<br>evidence of this sustained outstanding<br>leadership and outstanding performance<br>in three fields of endeavour that is<br>service to the profession and to the<br>university<br>teaching and research it's not a one<br>it's not a not a package that suits a<br>person who<br>only can succeed in one dimension so<br>just to highlight a few things about her<br>service and teaching performance and<br>leadership<br>she served at the to the school as<br>associate dean<br>for academic development and the school<br>of biomedical sciences<br>and her teaching quality has been<br>recognized by multiple prizes at school<br>division and university level<br>including best lecturer third year<br>medicine<br>university of otago award for excellence<br>in teaching<br>otago university students association<br>top supervisor prize<br>and otago school of medical sciences<br>distinguished academic teacher prize<br>research leadership she served seven<br>years as a member of the governing<br>council<br>of the royal society of new zealand the<br>national body<br>the preeminent scientific body in new<br>zealand<br>and at otago is a former director of the<br>neuroscience degree program<br>one of the largest degree programs by<br>enrolment<br>at the university and is currently<br>director of the brain health research<br>centre<br>again a major consortium of over 300<br>neuroscience researchers here at otago<br>that works to foster collaboration<br>information sharing and networking for<br>staff and students so<br>through these leadership roles she's<br>provided an underpinning<br>over many years to many aspects of<br>scientific<br>the research outputs of course we<br>measure research performance<br>by outputs and awards and so on and<br>christine has been recognized through<br>companionship of the royal society<br>tiaparangi<br>royal society of new zealand this year<br>so and in order to do research we need<br>money<br>and so the ability to write and win<br>research grants is a very important<br>aspect<br>of academic performance and fittingly of<br>course<br>as we would expect christine has been<br>highly successful in this sphere as well<br>named investigator on two<br>five-year hrc program grants these very<br>significant long-term support<br>programs and as well as multiple<br>personal grants<br>from the spi on the marsden grants<br>hrc center of research excellence grants<br>and so on and so forth too many to<br>to list here publications again<br>no time to go through the amazing array<br>of publications but<br>as one would expect at this level senior<br>and first<br>or first author uh position on multiple<br>peer-reviewed papers and scientific<br>journals including from a wide range<br>from<br>frontiers and neuroendocrinology<br>proceedings of the national academy of<br>sciences of the usa and<br>other very imminent journals in the<br>field<br>and these papers when we review<br>christine cv<br>cover a range of topics that reflect her<br>scientific journey<br>and a core theme though that can be<br>traced throughout most of them<br>is development the amazing story and<br>pitfalls of the process by which all<br>organisms<br>come to be so<br>her current recent and um current<br>personal research interests are<br>reflected<br>uh in the title of the talk that she has<br>on the screen there<br>um and as i said this relates to how the<br>brain forms before we are born how the<br>brain<br>forms before we are born with a<br>particular focus on understanding<br>how a mother's health during that<br>critical period of life<br>can impact on the unborn baby's health<br>and future development<br>so in in the talk this evening in her<br>lecture this evening christine plans to<br>take you<br>the audience on a journey from growing<br>up in rural<br>northern california to becoming<br>professor here at the university of<br>otago<br>in dunedin new zealand and paralleling<br>her academic career<br>talk will feature i understand a series<br>of the nets<br>on research teaching and service that<br>she hopes will resonate in one way or<br>another<br>with you all once again it's my pleasure<br>and privilege<br>to introduce to you professor josoni to<br>lecture<br>richard<br>tenekoto<br>thank you everybody welcome um thank you<br>so much for coming<br>um and um and greetings it's a<br>it's a privilege and an honor to be here<br>and i thank you very much for<br>so those of you who know me will know<br>that i have a bit of a reputation<br>in the health sciences first year for<br>playing music for people and there<br>actually is a reason that i do that<br>and i think i'm hoping that that's going<br>to become apparent<br>and i'll i'll let you all in on that<br>secret a little bit later<br>so i was born in san francisco<br>california shown here wait i do have a<br>point<br>what whoopsie i think you all get the<br>point that that's san francisco so i was<br>born<br>down here in the city but i grew up here<br>in northern california<br>a little bit in marin county but mostly<br>in a place called sonoma county so coast<br>manga is my mountain um so here is a map<br>of sonoma county where i grew up and<br>here right over here is sonoma mountain<br>there's a picture of it down here<br>on the bottom i actually grew up on the<br>coastal side<br>which is on the other side of the<br>mountain<br>and uh kopetalum te awa<br>my river is the petaluma river so here<br>you can see that there's a tributary of<br>the san francisco bay<br>and heads north up into a town called<br>peltaluma<br>and a little bit beyond no pengrove<br>california<br>which is where i'm from a small rural<br>town<br>in northern california when i was<br>growing up<br>i had a little t-shirt that said<br>population 400<br>elevation 60 to give you some idea<br>about where i grew up so when i grew up<br>i did a lot of different things as a<br>rural kid ordinarily does but probably<br>the lion's share<br>of my time was spent in places such as<br>this<br>with my best friend gerald<br>so growing up of course everybody will<br>be able to appreciate that you learn<br>all kinds of stuff so the things that i<br>um the lessons that i learned before i<br>went off and began my life were<br>operational things that were very<br>important things like close the gate<br>don't drive on the hose<br>but of course um much more important<br>things<br>that let me not that close the gate<br>isn't important mind you it's very<br>important<br>um but always remember to finish what<br>you start and remember please and thank<br>you<br>these are things that still come in<br>quite handy in my life<br>so from pengrove i um as brian said<br>i went to school at one of the<br>university of california<br>schools and the school that i went to is<br>called the university of california in<br>riverside<br>now um without the internet<br>at this time i kind of mistakenly<br>believed that there was actually a river<br>in riverside and<br>whilst there probably is in reality<br>riverside is in the middle of the desert<br>in southern california<br>so here's just some photographs of<br>riverside it's what<br>everybody i think kind of thinks of when<br>they think about southern california<br>towns<br>and of course it is in the desert we've<br>got the requisite cactus<br>etc i went to the university of<br>california at riverside here's a picture<br>of the campus<br>where i went to school and i don't know<br>some prescience that must have been<br>taking place at the time<br>our mascot was the highlanders so go<br>figure i don't know what that was all<br>about<br>but um so we were we were a bear that<br>wore<br>a tartan fantastic it was the only<br>university of california besides<br>berkeley that had a bell tower at the<br>time and<br>the bell tower actually turned out to be<br>this fantastic place where<br>people came to gather and there was all<br>kinds of crazy<br>uh um including of course the carillon<br>players<br>practice time which was also um<br>quite a bit of fun um i went there um as<br>brian said<br>um to study biology and mathematics so<br>this is just one of the buildings that<br>was there at the time that i went there<br>and this was really the first time i<br>originally went there to study<br>mathematics and computer science<br>and um left with a degree<br>in biology i'm so<br>i don't know if any of you are yeast<br>geneticists but if anybody in the<br>audience is a yeast geneticist you'll be<br>able to recognize this<br>this was the first opportunity that i<br>had in my last year of<br>undergraduate university to um start to<br>work in the lab and so<br>um they got undergraduates to do the<br>real grunt work in the lab<br>and this is um a petri dish with um<br>spotting of what are called tetrads i'm<br>not going to tell you what those are but<br>yeast make a little um spore sac and<br>there's four tetrads in it like their<br>name suggests<br>and if you're wanting to know anything<br>about the genetics of the yeast then you<br>take a<br>very very tiny drawn out glass pipette<br>and you painstakingly upside down<br>pull these little tetrads out of their<br>little case and you spot them<br>in an array that looks like this and<br>this tells you depending on what you're<br>interested in looking at it tells you<br>something about the genetics of the<br>yeast<br>so this was the first time that i ever<br>encountered<br>um biological sciences and i thought<br>that was really cool<br>and this is also the first time that i<br>had what we would now consider to be a<br>mentor<br>there was a chap here who's called andy<br>henderson who now has his a lab<br>at boston university he's an<br>immunologist but he was a masters<br>student at the time and i thought wow oh<br>my god<br>he knows everything that there is to<br>know<br>and he was fantastic in that role<br>so my undergraduate time in riverside<br>was as you might imagine<br>very um full of all kinds of crazy<br>things we've all been undergraduates we<br>all know what<br>happens when you're undergraduate so my<br>lessons learned from being an<br>undergraduate were<br>oh yeah never straighten your friend's<br>hair without wearing gloves that is if<br>you use chemical straighteners if you<br>use that<br>um that iron thing don't worry about it<br>this was the first time that i thought<br>oh no i have to study<br>what is this i've never had to study<br>before and then of course this is the<br>place where not only did i work in a lab<br>but also learned tons and tons of stuff<br>about biology and i really really at<br>that point<br>even though i went there to study<br>mathematics and computer<br>science i left loving biology which<br>really kind of set the stage<br>for where i would go next so<br>at that point from having been down here<br>in riverside<br>so i headed up to seattle and if those<br>of you um in the audience know seattle<br>you will know<br>why i played that so seattle is<br>fantastic if you've never been there you<br>should visit it's phenomenal<br>and and when i went when i moved to<br>seattle<br>as a phd student you can imagine lots of<br>really really exciting things were on<br>offer<br>so if you were into music so i played a<br>little bit of nirvana there<br>you could go pop down to the central<br>tavern a sleazy dive right in the middle<br>of seattle<br>and at the time although they're popular<br>now they were whoopsie completely<br>unheard of<br>so we've got nirvana pearl jam and sound<br>garden but there's also allison chains<br>and a bunch of bands that<br>never have become famous and some that<br>have become ultra famous<br>on their sub pop label here my good<br>friend um<br>worked in their uh front office and so<br>that was always good we could go hang<br>out and<br>various of these kinds of chaps who i<br>didn't know who they were<br>um came wandering through but it was all<br>kind of interesting and fun in<br>retrospect<br>of course if you're not into the music<br>scene or even if you are there's<br>a phenomenal sports scene oh my goodness<br>for those of you who are familiar with<br>american sport<br>um and even if you're not i'll tell you<br>who they are we've got dave craig up<br>here<br>the quarterback with the smallest hands<br>in the nfl ever<br>he was throwing to steve largent at the<br>time who's not shown here<br>we've got randy johnson the unit the<br>fastest fastball thrower<br>pitcher on the planet at least at the<br>time<br>we've got the sonics who i think<br>unfortunately are no longer in seattle<br>we've got the huskies where it says<br>you're the best team ever with a<br>question mike like that should be a<br>question right they are the best team<br>ever yes<br>the huskies and if you're not into any<br>of that or if you are<br>into that there's other things that you<br>can do too and<br>one of the things that seattle is famous<br>for is the outdoor activities it has<br>mountains galore the city is situated in<br>between two gigantic mountain ranges<br>and i really took advantage of that<br>while i was there<br>now of course i didn't actually go there<br>to do<br>any of those things the reason that i<br>went there was to go here<br>which is at the to the university of<br>washington in seattle and in particular<br>i went there to go to the university of<br>washington medical center<br>uwmc as it's called and so that<br>is this complex that ranges from here<br>down to here so the research labs are<br>here<br>this is clinical labs and then this is<br>the main hospital now seattle has a<br>complex or<br>has scattered throughout the city a<br>number of of<br>probably a six other really big scale<br>hospitals<br>and so the health sciences network in<br>seattle is phenomenal i have never been<br>to a place that has<br>a better health sciences network spread<br>across the universe the<br>the entire city um as seattle although<br>i'm aware that others<br>that might come close to exist so what<br>you do when you're<br>a phd student in the united states is<br>slightly different to what you do in phd<br>study here<br>so you have um when you first start off<br>you don't<br>you haven't you don't match with a<br>supervisor you write your<br>your letter of intent and you tell them<br>what you're interested in studying and<br>how fantastic you are but<br>what you do when you actually get there<br>is go through labs<br>in about 10 week blocks which we call<br>rotations so rotation students are kind<br>of the lowest of the low<br>in university graduate studenthood<br>in the united states but as a rotation<br>student i did have the good fortune of<br>rotating through a number of labs<br>that had a number of very very<br>influential people in them<br>and probably the most influential person<br>in my site my my nascent scientific<br>career is professor anita hendrickson<br>who i've got<br>shown here she's a very very classic<br>neuro anatomist who was like the goddess<br>of all things visual system neuroanatomy<br>and i did a rotation in her lab because<br>i'd never really considered the nervous<br>system before i<br>i had come to graduate school wanting to<br>study immunology<br>or any of you who are immunologists in<br>the audience and i was actually sort of<br>um had already done a rotation in a<br>in a t cell lab and um i got to talking<br>and i started working with anita and<br>and she started planting those seeds you<br>know christine i think you really should<br>be thinking about neuroscience you know<br>the brain and the visual system and on<br>and on and on<br>and um and then she said you know<br>i think that you'd be really good and we<br>have this new guy coming<br>professor tom ray who had just finished<br>appointment as a new lecturer at calgary<br>and had moved had just been hired by the<br>department<br>to come to the university of washington<br>and so tom<br>was my phd supervisor he's now the<br>co-head of the stem cell institute at<br>the university of washington and<br>one of the team leaders at the allen<br>institute so<br>he's still quite prominent in the field<br>and was very very inspirational to me in<br>a number of ways<br>so for those of you who are or have been<br>students or have worked with me in the<br>past<br>um all of my foibles as a supervisor i<br>can blame on tom<br>but he had a fantastic philosophy of<br>just letting students come into the lab<br>and find out who they are let them flail<br>and let them find themselves<br>before you really start putting the<br>screws to them now the unfortunate thing<br>about that<br>mindset is it's a little bit more<br>difficult here so i apologize if i've<br>put the screws to you a little bit early<br>but tom's philosophy was really good<br>because it was one of those philosophies<br>that really allows you to grow<br>as a scientist we start i started off<br>with a very scripted project which then<br>grew as i grew as a scientist and was<br>flexible to allow me to find the ways<br>and directions that i wanted to take<br>instrumental in that as well<br>was professor hank rolink who had just<br>discovered the vertebrate<br>sonic hedgehog in tom jussel's lab at<br>columbia and had come<br>out to the university of washington as<br>well and<br>in the later part of my phd hank<br>collaborating with hank<br>and his lab was very instrumental<br>so i thought that i would and some of<br>you have already seen this already but<br>i thought that i would show you some<br>slides from<br>my phd thesis defense now<br>those of you who are about my age will<br>be able to appreciate what we're looking<br>at here and<br>so in the good old days when powerpoint<br>just started off everybody made these<br>garish slides<br>well i did but many people did i just<br>copied what other people had done<br>where you've got a blue background with<br>this bright yellow writing and all of my<br>slides look just like this<br>so that was the title of my phd thesis<br>and and i guess the important thing to<br>think about is that<br>i kind of at the time sort of did what<br>was trendy<br>so in the lead-up to this a couple of<br>well geneticists drosophila<br>fruit fly geneticist who later won the<br>nobel prize for their work<br>had done this big mutagenesis screen and<br>what that did<br>was it gave us<br>an enormous number of new genes that<br>could be interrogated<br>both for what they did to the flies when<br>they were mutant but what they did<br>to in the normal function of the<br>development of the fly<br>and what was quite popular at the time<br>was<br>exactly what i did in my phd thesis<br>which was to say<br>okay so here we have these fantastic<br>genes everybody's worked out all these<br>uh these gene networks in in the fruit<br>fly and drosophila<br>and so now nobody cares about fruit<br>flies anyway<br>sorry peter if you're listening um but<br>wouldn't it be cool to see if we could<br>dissect what these things do<br>invertebrates i mean that's where all<br>the action is right and so<br>there was a huge glut of research of<br>which my phd was one of<br>where people looked to find homologues<br>of these these really important<br>drosophila developmental genes<br>in vertebrate animals and to try and<br>understand what their role was<br>in various developmental processes in<br>developing vertebrates<br>so um i was very much interested in<br>a family of of genes called the ekitsuki<br>complex that's what it was called in<br>fruit flies<br>and so my the approach or the sort of if<br>you want to think about it<br>the um what you might think of as my phd<br>proposal<br>at the time would be i was going to<br>identify these<br>cute homologs and i was going to use we<br>use the chicken as the model system i<br>later shifted to<br>using rats but we were going to i wanted<br>to know how<br>these things were involved in generating<br>a retina the retina<br>like many places in our brain is made up<br>of tons of different types of neurons<br>and they're generated in a particular<br>sequence over time but before this era<br>of research we had no idea what the<br>genetic underpinning<br>of this process was and so my<br>i guess contribution to the field was<br>not only was i able to identify<br>some akitsu homologues that were present<br>in<br>vertebrate retina but i also then<br>characterized their expression patterns<br>and a little bit about their function<br>so that was my approach there i'm just<br>going to show you a couple of things<br>which again<br>this is all very dated so um one of the<br>big tasks which took me quite some time<br>to do<br>was to clone 1.9 kilobases<br>of the the chicken akitsuke homologue or<br>cash1<br>gene so that's the gene sequence shown<br>there um<br>this would take like two seconds by<br>normal sequencing uh<br>methodologies that we use today but for<br>those of you in the audience who like a<br>photography here and if you remember<br>at the time what you did was you ran<br>these massive sequencing gels i never<br>broke a glass plate but<br>the plates were probably this big you<br>siliconized them you poured your gel<br>you ran your sequencing reactions down<br>them and then<br>you painstakingly called out usually to<br>somebody else while you had your ruler<br>there<br>a t g c all the way through<br>each one of those lanes every single one<br>of those bands<br>until you came up with a sequence that<br>looked like that<br>thank goodness that the human genome<br>never would have been sequenced<br>if we had to do that um<br>so but that's how it was in those days<br>the other thing that um i had to do then<br>was to characterize the expression<br>of these akitsukit homologs and these<br>are just some examples of this this was<br>the very very early days of doing in<br>situ hybridization<br>which is a method that we can use to<br>identify where genes are expressed<br>within cells<br>so where you see the purple is where<br>there is expression of these<br>this gene that i had identified and i'm<br>not going to go through what all that<br>means in terms of neurogenesis<br>except to say that at stage 32 what you<br>can see is there's a lot of it<br>and then it diminishes as the as the<br>developing retina<br>gets older and indeed some subsequent<br>experiments that i did which i don't<br>have<br>particularly good images of addressed<br>the fact and and identified that these<br>genes were probably important<br>in the generation of retinal neurons<br>that um<br>that were that developed in this period<br>between stage 32 and 37 and as it turns<br>out somebody<br>subsequent to me has deleted them and<br>shown that you do that those cell types<br>don't exist<br>so i think<br>i'm doing a phd is um one of the lessons<br>that i learned i've got that no fear<br>thing up there is that<br>that's where i really learned that you<br>got to kind of just go with what you're<br>going to go with<br>don't worry about what other people<br>think don't worry about your<br>insecurities<br>just go at it with no fear it's probably<br>going to be some of the best work of<br>your life if not<br>the best work of your life there's many<br>people in here who have<br>phds who can probably um think about<br>whether<br>it is or not the best work of your life<br>but i think it's probably some of my<br>best work<br>i think the thing that you need to do if<br>you're in the audience and you're in<br>that position right now is enjoy it<br>you're still a student<br>embrace your intellect and your freedom<br>every decision that you make after this<br>narrows your scope publish publish your<br>bum<br>off there's no there's no other way of<br>saying that<br>and then the last thing that you do you<br>should do if you haven't already<br>and this was one thing that i really<br>enjoyed this aspect of it<br>is to meet and make friends with as many<br>colleagues as possible<br>they'll always remember you with fond<br>memories<br>and that also means that they'll fondly<br>refer to you and support you<br>by providing you with supportive grant<br>or manuscript reviews<br>and that kind of thing continues across<br>your scientific career<br>after moving to<br>so after finishing my phd i was really<br>really enthusiastic about this whole<br>idea of of using genetics in order to<br>identify genes that are important in<br>development<br>and and i got i got so excited about<br>doing this that i actually<br>initially scrapped the vertebrate model<br>and decided i was going to go actually<br>and do some drosophila genetics i was<br>actually going to do the genetics myself<br>so i moved actually just down the street<br>to the fred hutchinson cancer research<br>center<br>so this is the hutch here in brick<br>so basic science is here cancer care<br>alliance<br>the car park and public health over here<br>so i worked way over here in basic<br>science<br>um and like i was saying<br>in the lead up to my phd there were a<br>lot of people in labs who had<br>done these mutagenesis screens and<br>identified genes that were present in<br>fruit flies<br>and those people who had done those<br>things had labs who then had postdocs<br>who were going out and setting up their<br>own lab<br>and at the hutch a woman had come from<br>one of the labs the jam lab down in san<br>francisco and she had set up at this new<br>lab<br>um to do some drosophila genetics and i<br>was going to be one of her first<br>postdocs and i was going to get involved<br>in this<br>that was fantastic i was super excited<br>about doing that<br>so there's a bit of a snag my pi decided<br>that she didn't want to stay in science<br>anymore so she<br>she quit to teach yoga and that is a<br>that is a picture that i took off the<br>internet<br>um of her we we all laugh<br>to this day actually um those of us who<br>and so then for the first time kind of<br>in my career i thought oh<br>god what am i going to do this is kind<br>of unexpected ah<br>as it turns out i had always kind of had<br>in the back of my mind this little plan<br>that because i was interested in<br>mathematics and computational biology<br>that<br>maybe there was this new thing about<br>bioinformatics that was kind of heating<br>up at the time<br>um and maybe that would be something<br>that i could get interested in<br>and of course i had already had a bit of<br>background in the immune system<br>so i shifted to a lab that was actually<br>over<br>over here more in cancer care alliance<br>there was a clinical lab<br>doing immunogenetics and our lab<br>sequenced<br>the longest at its time at the time<br>sequence read of the human major<br>histocompatibility complex<br>and um so i kind of went from this to<br>this<br>so it worked out really well in the end<br>so<br>that was fine um but it taught me a<br>couple of other lessons<br>about the vagaries of science and the<br>first of those was um<br>you know nobody cares about you like<br>when you're a phd student<br>you get nurtured along and and certainly<br>there's opportunity for you to grow as<br>an individual scientist and all that but<br>if somebody's going to leave they're<br>just going to leave they don't actually<br>care<br>they all have their own problems to deal<br>with um and and that caused me of course<br>to reflect on probably what caused my<br>previous<br>comment was gosh wasn't it great being a<br>phd student oh i thought it was so<br>horrible but now hey that looks like a<br>pretty good deal<br>and this was the point at which i also<br>said<br>so there was at this point a sort of a<br>burgeoning biotechnology industry that<br>was growing out of these various<br>research<br>labs mainly doing bioinformatics and<br>particularly in the area of cancer<br>genetics<br>and so i had the opportunity we laid the<br>groundwork with that nature paper<br>as a lab that was good at doing the<br>sequencing and also developing the<br>assays<br>and i don't know if many of you are<br>familiar with the fred hutchinson cancer<br>research center but their kind of<br>big claim to fame is uh is<br>pioneering bone marrow transplants and<br>so we started this company with the<br>idea that we would<br>be able to use immunogenetics actually<br>to better match donors and recipients<br>in bone marrow transplant so um<br>the last point here then probably is<br>retrospective but<br>if you're considering leaving academia<br>probably you should give just a little<br>bit of thought in the back of your mind<br>to what you might do if you change your<br>mind and want to get back in<br>because certainly that's what i did so<br>i'm going to leave out<br>all of that part that has to do with the<br>time that i spent<br>doing research in industry and move<br>pretty much to the next move that i made<br>from an academic perspective um like<br>brian said i actually moved here because<br>i got recruited<br>to be the head of bioinformatics at<br>pacific edge but i didn't stay there<br>long<br>and partly that's because i was longing<br>for getting back to the nervous system<br>what was i going to do this all this<br>immunogenetics was fine and being an<br>industry was actually really good in the<br>sense that<br>i got a whole different perspective<br>about how to do science<br>how to manage and deal with people and<br>and to have very set and strict<br>goals but as many of you will know part<br>of the whole<br>appeal of working in a university is<br>that you have the freedom to pursue the<br>things that you want to pursue<br>now there's obviously typically some<br>kind of guidelines or<br>or borders in which you stay but but<br>often<br>um there's a freedom to it a kind of i<br>you get to be your own boss and pick the<br>projects that<br>really excite you and that's sort of<br>what i was missing i really missed that<br>about<br>about academia so at about the time for<br>those of you who are<br>for those of you who are in cne you'll<br>particularly enjoy this<br>so nice huh<br>so that's alan herbison and at the time<br>there were<br>a number of us who worked in allen's lab<br>so um son cuhan came with<br>alan from cambridge so allen was a very<br>successful neuroendocrinologist who<br>actually had gone to the university of<br>otago<br>um to get his mbc hb did a bit of<br>doctoring for a while and then headed to<br>cambridge<br>um and he returned at about the time<br>that i returned<br>and rebecca campbell came from the<br>united states so<br>what we had was alan me and rebecca and<br>song q<br>as post-docs and rob porteous who was<br>the technician in the lab<br>and we were a very tight bunch if you<br>know the center for neuroendocrinology<br>and the herbicide lab at all you'll know<br>that it's<br>massively expanded and now has<br>contracted again<br>but i think the important thing about<br>this is that you know<br>really really wanted to get back to<br>academia i missed neuroscience i missed<br>doing experimental science<br>and so i really really really needed<br>this to work<br>um and so it did unfortunately<br>and i'm not going to talk a lot about<br>what i did while i was at<br>working with alan but one of the things<br>that i did is kind of shown in this<br>journal and neuroscience paper here<br>where and there's a cell here so this is<br>a gnrh neuron and it's expressing a<br>genetically encoded calcium indicator<br>this is one of the very very first<br>generation calcium indicators<br>it didn't indicate very well you had to<br>look at lots and lots of different cells<br>sometimes they responded sometimes they<br>didn't there's phenomenally better tools<br>for doing this now and many of them have<br>been developed in alan's lab<br>since this time many of them by people<br>who are sitting in the audience<br>but it was actually quite exciting it<br>was a really interesting and fun way to<br>get back into<br>doing neuroscience and i guess the thing<br>that i liked most about it is you could<br>actually watch these cells doing<br>cell things it was really cool<br>and we never did sort out what those<br>calcium waves that that<br>those neurons were showing actually do i<br>think that might still be a work in<br>progress for people who work in gnrh<br>neurons<br>and trying to work out what the<br>electrical activity of these cells<br>actually means<br>and have for their actual function and<br>and how those are related<br>so um again like i've in my theme here<br>lessons learned nobody cares about your<br>future i mentioned that right<br>i mean that's one of the things that you<br>really really got to start thinking<br>about now because now i've finished my<br>postdoc<br>i got a bunch of papers i got some<br>really cool stuff<br>uh what am i going to do now well so the<br>one thing that you got to do<br>always is publish and the thing that's<br>really key<br>i think about this and this is one of<br>the things that looking back on it i<br>didn't do as well as i could have but i<br>think i did an okay job of it<br>and that was once you get into what<br>you're thinking is kind of<br>your terminal training position ready to<br>move on to<br>a job is that you should know where<br>you're going<br>even if that changes slightly have a<br>broad view of where you're going<br>and be sure that you lay that groundwork<br>out<br>as soon as you possibly can or goodness<br>only knows you could drift for quite a<br>long time<br>all right so here we are finally 2008<br>i got hired by the department of anatomy<br>now one of the things that probably i<br>should tell you about is that when i was<br>working in allen's lab i was interested<br>in the function of adult neurons<br>you may also have gleaned from what i<br>said earlier in my talk and from what<br>brian said when he introduced me is that<br>i'm actually not interested in adult<br>neurons i'm interested in developing<br>neurons<br>and so this was finally the opportunity<br>for me to<br>really start my own research program<br>looking at something that<br>was kind of a return in a way to what i<br>did in my phd<br>but just in a slightly different way and<br>so what we're interested in in my lab<br>is understanding how the brain develops<br>before we're born<br>and you might say to yourself okay well<br>so why is she so on about the brain we<br>keep hearing about how she returned to<br>the brain and it isn't that great<br>well your brain controls everything that<br>you do<br>and what you think and what you feel and<br>this is a picture of the brain that i<br>have that i<br>that i show in health sciences first<br>year where we tend to you know sort of<br>categorize the brain<br>by these colors here in terms of its<br>functionality<br>but any of you in the audience will know<br>that if those areas don't operate in<br>isolation that that each of these<br>areas operates in a coordinated fashion<br>they need to communicate with each other<br>in order for the brain to do what it<br>does<br>so that can be simple things like if i<br>throw a ball at you in the audience<br>you can count you're going to catch it<br>and that's because so you use your<br>the visual part of your brain to see the<br>ball coming at you<br>you um if you need to move underneath<br>to position yourself under the ball<br>you'll use some aspects of your somatic<br>sensory some out of sensory<br>system in order to do that you'll need<br>some coordination<br>to do the task as well if you're going<br>to want to catch the ball again if it's<br>not a one-off right you're playing sport<br>or something like that then you're going<br>to want to remember<br>what you did when you caught it and<br>you're going to want to not remember<br>what you did when you dropped it now of<br>course i've got this big<br>area in the front of the brain here<br>that's all about motivation and and<br>and emotion and decision making and all<br>that but of course if you catch it<br>you're going to be really happy right<br>so i think even doing such a simple act<br>as that<br>you can see that all of these things<br>have to be integrated<br>now what i didn't tell you about has<br>in many ways to do with the music that<br>i've been playing now many of you will<br>have recognized the songs that i played<br>for some of you those songs will have<br>made you laugh<br>or made you happy or made you go oh god<br>i always hated this song<br>why did she have to play that and and<br>you have a slew of memories and emotions<br>that are attached to that<br>that are very very unique to you<br>and the reason that they are so you<br>you are able to do that and have so many<br>other opinions and emotions and<br>reactions to things that happen in your<br>world is because your brain is unique<br>and the reason that your brain<br>is unique is because of this<br>connectivity that i've told you about<br>so take a terani or the milky way has<br>about 200 billion stars in it that's the<br>estimate that astronomers have made<br>your brain has a number of connections<br>it's 10 to the 17th so<br>all you math whizzes will be able to do<br>the easy uh calculation there<br>and and and figure out<br>that if you think about the number of<br>stars in the milky way<br>your brain has if you think about the<br>connections now<br>worth of connections in it and that<br>provides the substrate for our<br>uniqueness and so that gives rise to<br>things like this<br>everybody's going to identify with the<br>items on here but<br>each of your identifications with the<br>various array of items here<br>is going to be different you know do you<br>like bach or led zeppelin the cat or the<br>dog<br>red or white wine sport politics<br>everything and all of our reactions to<br>everything<br>so with that as the subject matter how<br>could you<br>sorry and not only that<br>so understanding the development of the<br>brain then really gives you the<br>substrate on which you can<br>understand how a brain is built so that<br>it can give rise<br>to all of this fantastic functionality<br>so<br>in my lab so so the other thing that's<br>really cool about the brain though is<br>it's turning out from public health<br>studies that<br>there are a number of complications of<br>pregnancy that can happen<br>that can give rise to i don't want to<br>say defects but which can change the<br>functionality of the brain in various<br>ways<br>some of which people don't like<br>or provide them with difficulties<br>throughout their lives<br>and the maternal<br>pregnancy complications i've got listed<br>here obesity gestational diabetes stress<br>preterm birth and infection are by and<br>large things that a woman cannot help<br>and so if she has one of these and her<br>children<br>by public health study criteria are more<br>likely<br>to potentially end up with one of these<br>neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric<br>disorders<br>then it would be useful from a brain<br>development perspective to understand<br>how this association comes about<br>and so this is what we do in my lab so<br>we've been focusing specifically on<br>obesity<br>um and how that has an impact<br>on uh on offspring brain health so we<br>use an animal model<br>where we feed mouse dams a high fat diet<br>until they become 30 or more heavier<br>than<br>their chow fed uh companions<br>and then we mate them and then we ask of<br>their offspring does anything happen to<br>brain<br>to brain development that could explain<br>this association with disease<br>and i just wanted to take you through<br>one little vignette a study that was<br>done<br>a couple years back now by my postdoc<br>kelly who's getting really embarrassed<br>now<br>where we looked at the develop a part of<br>the brain called the amygdala<br>so what we know from human studies<br>already is that<br>increased activity or hyperactive<br>amygdala<br>is common in patients that have anxiety<br>disorders<br>and we also know that drugs that are<br>able to reduce this<br>exciter excitatory or hyperactive neural<br>circuitry<br>are able to reduce anxiety in a number<br>of patients who have anxiety<br>and so we thought okay well i mean what<br>we really want to try and do with our<br>animal model is see how well it can<br>model different human situations<br>and if we find when we find human<br>situations that it models<br>then dig a little bit deeper into the<br>cellular and molecular underpinnings<br>that are actually giving rise to these<br>associations<br>so that's what we did that's what kelly<br>did so the first thing that we wanted to<br>know is<br>is there an anxiety phenotype in our<br>animals that is<br>do they have the mouse equivalent of<br>what we might think of as anxiety in<br>humans<br>so the first thing that she did was to<br>test anxiety and she used two different<br>metrics for that ultrasonic<br>vocalizations and the elevated plus maze<br>now ultrasonic vocalizations are really<br>cool so mice babies as it turns out<br>communicate with their moms not<br>surprisingly using these little<br>ultrasonic calls so things that we can't<br>hear but which you can record<br>and if you take the pups away from their<br>mom they call out to her<br>and it turns out that the offspring of<br>obese dams if you take their mom away<br>they call out a lot they get really<br>really anxious when mom leaves<br>we've tested for other things that might<br>be that might be able to account for<br>that<br>but it seems that they get just<br>generally a lot more anxious that she's<br>gone<br>so this is the number of calls that they<br>make these are what the control mice<br>look like<br>and the offspring of the high fat diet<br>moms<br>have significantly more calls they're<br>like really really nervous that she's<br>gone<br>the other thing that we do is we use<br>this thing called the elevated plus maze<br>so this really doesn't give it justice<br>but it stands about this high<br>it's in the configuration of a plus um<br>and it has two<br>arms in it one set of arms has these<br>little covers on it so it's nice and<br>cozy and dark and the mouse can go in<br>there<br>but for bold mice they will um<br>venture out onto these open arms so if<br>you imagine the size of the mouse<br>and a couple a meter or so high platform<br>i mean ah that's pretty far down there<br>uh as it turns out mice tend to be kind<br>of bold anyway<br>so they will go out there and so what<br>you can do is you can measure the amount<br>of time they spend going out onto the<br>scary open arm and use that as a test of<br>anxiety<br>and what kelly showed was that normal<br>mice are a bit bold they'll actually go<br>out there and have a look down<br>but the offspring of high fat um mums<br>um showed that reduced a reduced<br>penchants for going out there they were<br>a little bit freaked out by it and<br>preferred to stay in the closed arms<br>all right so the offspring of obese dams<br>have anxiety-like behaviors so tick one<br>for being able to model a human type of<br>situation<br>the next thing that we did was try to<br>evaluate hyperactivity so i told you<br>that some of that human data that we've<br>already looked at<br>showed that there was hyperactivity in<br>the neural circuits of the amygdala<br>so this is a diagram where we've just<br>looked at gene expression<br>that is has by us and others been used<br>as metrics<br>for excitatory activity in the amygdala<br>and what you can see is there there's a<br>number of excitatory markers so<br>normal mice are set to one which is a<br>dotted line<br>and the hype the um the high fat<br>offspring mice<br>showing an elevation in this excitatory<br>activity so again<br>seeming to phenocopy what we see in<br>humans<br>so now that we've got the model now we<br>can drill a little bit deeper and one of<br>the things that kelly did was to look to<br>see<br>if part of this could be a developmental<br>defect like are there more cells<br>that are excitatory and that's what's<br>driving the circuit or are there more<br>circuits that are excitatory<br>could that be doing it um and so what<br>she did here was she<br>initially just counted the excitatory<br>cells in the amygdala<br>and that's what's shown in green here so<br>blue is all cells<br>and green are just the excitatory cells<br>this is the control this is what the<br>normal number of excitatory cells looks<br>like<br>and i hope you can appreciate just by<br>looking at this there's tons more of<br>them<br>in the anxious amygdala and that's<br>what's shown in the bar graph here<br>so what we concluded from that is that<br>there's something<br>about gestation and an obese dam that<br>deregulates the development of cell<br>production the normal cell production<br>in the amygdala which leads to<br>hyperactivity and an anxiety phenotype<br>so that's just like a little example of<br>what we do we've gone on<br>and of a process of experimentation that<br>we would ordinarily undertake<br>we've cataloged tons and tons of other<br>changes we see neural circuitry<br>being messed up or malformed in a<br>variety of different places<br>we've gone on to characterize the<br>developmental genes that ordinarily<br>underpin the development of that<br>circuitry<br>and shown that they are aberrant one of<br>my students just recently<br>completed his master's looking at<br>myelination and we've shown that there's<br>changes in myelation and we know that<br>mild and that's the the<br>um the fatty covering of your of your<br>nerve axons<br>and so when you have perturbations and<br>myelination that's a that's a clear<br>indicator that the circuitry is not<br>correct<br>and for a lot of these we've been now<br>delving deeper still<br>into how it is that these developmental<br>defects have come about and found that<br>there's changes in the epigenetic<br>regulation<br>of development important genes that<br>underpin the development of these<br>various<br>places in the brain the other thing that<br>we've done is tried to<br>take a stab at working out what this<br>something is what are the factors that<br>are actually driving these changes<br>and thomas kim primarily did this work<br>when he was a phd student<br>he found that the placenta has changed<br>it's producing a lot more inflammatory<br>cytokines and also its permeability<br>changes so<br>we tend to think of the placenta as<br>being a place in the developing<br>sort of fetal maternal interface that<br>protects the fetus and it looks like<br>that might<br>be broken down a bit there's<br>inflammatory cytokines and he's also<br>shown that the blood-brain barrier<br>formation is aberrant so<br>potentially the brain is being exposed<br>to a lot of things that it wouldn't<br>ordinarily be exposed to<br>we have a working model that goes<br>something like this obesity during<br>pregnancy gives rise to<br>inflammation in the offspring higher<br>cytokine levels which are generating a<br>level of information which<br>impinges upon the developing brain to<br>change the epigenetic regulation<br>not only of genes that are regulating<br>brain development itself<br>but also the actual functioning of the<br>brain in order to give rise to aberrant<br>neuronal circuitry<br>in the in the formed brain in the<br>adolescent and adult animals<br>so this is all well and good this tells<br>us a number of things about practical<br>outcomes that this research has<br>associated with it<br>so we might be able to have some<br>research informed guidelines about how<br>one<br>might go about having a healthy<br>pregnancy that's always good moms are<br>always very willing<br>to kind of get a grip on what they can<br>do best<br>to to have a healthy pregnancy in the<br>situations where people can't<br>do anything about it so obesity<br>gestational diabetes the list that i<br>said before<br>these are things that you can't do<br>anything about oftentimes<br>so be useful to understand what's going<br>on from a cellular and molecular<br>perspective so that you could<br>potentially<br>derive develop some kind of treatments<br>or therapeutics to<br>protect the developing offspring and of<br>course this allows us to have early<br>detection and treatment of at-risk kids<br>so we can have<br>behavioral therapy for example coming on<br>board<br>i did i did want to um just have a brief<br>um slide um this because<br>what happens a lot when i tell people<br>about the research that i do<br>is that i get accused of mum shaming and<br>i think that<br>probably that it couldn't be farther<br>from the truth<br>i'm there's no denying that the fetus<br>and the mother have probably one of the<br>most intimate relationships<br>between two individuals that can't ever<br>happen so<br>regardless of of how much responsibility<br>a mother should take i think biology<br>dictates quite a lot of that<br>so the other thing i think that's<br>important to bear in mind is that<br>i've told you about a number of<br>behavioral outcomes in the offspring<br>that we think of as detrimental<br>and because we think of them as<br>detrimental we we want to<br>eliminate them but biology doesn't<br>really work that way<br>when when something when the brain<br>developing brains<br>is exposed to something that it wouldn't<br>ordinarily be exposed to<br>lots and lots of things are going to<br>happen there's going to be lots of<br>changes<br>some of those are going to be<br>detrimental some of those<br>the vast majority of them are not going<br>to make a bit of difference one way or<br>another they'll be completely neutral<br>and some of them are going to be<br>beneficial<br>and it's the beneficial ones that i<br>think are the most fascinating<br>the unfortunate problem to that kind of<br>identifying what those beneficial things<br>are is that<br>we don't as yet have a way actually of<br>defining<br>behaviorally what is beneficial we can<br>think of a number of things wellness<br>robustness flexibility<br>a variety of different things but until<br>we're able to model that and really<br>clearly define<br>what constitutes a good outcome<br>then we're in a position where we can't<br>exactly address what those beneficial<br>brain changes are but i bet you they're<br>there<br>and i bet that we and others with any<br>luck at all are going to find them in<br>the not too distant future<br>i wanted to leave with one two other<br>slides this one<br>to remind you that and to remind myself<br>and to kind of pull come back to some of<br>the introductory remarks<br>is that in these jobs we're 40 research<br>40<br>teaching 20 service if you don't play<br>the full<br>hand you're never going to get there<br>you've got to do that<br>because not only is that part of the job<br>but it's<br>that's what makes the job really fun i<br>mean i love research and<br>and and there's plenty of people out<br>there who are gung-ho research all the<br>way<br>and i have absolutely no problem with<br>that but in our job<br>the other 60 is also really fun<br>and for me incredibly fulfilling so i'm<br>going to lump<br>all of the other 60 into a single slide<br>that pretty much encompasses all the<br>other stuff that i have done<br>in my time at otago so as was mentioned<br>in my introduction<br>i won a university teaching award and my<br>co-awardees are here<br>um i was the um on the governing council<br>of the royal society of new zealand for<br>six almost seven years i started off<br>being the president of the otago<br>institute for the arts and sciences<br>which sort of got me on my way<br>i've i was the director of the otago<br>neuroscience program<br>the director of the brain health<br>research center i've done a number of<br>committee and leadership roles around<br>the university in my department<br>my division and at university level<br>and i've been a shameless promoter of my<br>research and the university<br>throughout my career both doing public<br>talks with some of my public talk mates<br>participating in fora and<br>discussion and panel talks being on the<br>radio<br>i for two years wrote a popular science<br>column for the southland times that many<br>of you may remember<br>which is now gone by the wayside<br>as well as sitting on grant panels and<br>you name it a variety of different<br>things and<br>all of that together alongside the<br>research and<br>the experience of being with my<br>colleagues and students<br>trainees of a variety of different types<br>is really what's made this<br>one of the most well the most fantastic<br>journey that one could imagine<br>my lessons learned are if you're in the<br>position that i was in in 2008<br>waste no time read the promotion<br>documentation<br>and the day that you sign that contract<br>get a mentor and meet with them i mean<br>like really meet with them don't just<br>put down on paper that you have a mentor<br>and if you can find a like-minded group<br>of colleagues and hatch your plans to<br>take over the world<br>and just do it don't let anything<br>anything get in your way<br>i wanted to end nami nui koto to<br>all of the people i if your name will be<br>on here i guarantee it<br>um and an array of students and trainees<br>who've been involved in the lab over the<br>my name is lisa madison-smith and um i<br>am the head of department of anatomy<br>and it is my job um to<br>basically um wrap this evening up<br>and i don't know i would imagine the<br>rest of you feel the same way that i do<br>having just watched this<br>amazing lecture um it's really given us<br>some<br>some quite some insight i think into<br>christine and things that i<br>didn't necessarily know about christine<br>but it all kind of comes together don't<br>believe the stuff about how great<br>washington is that<br>oh yeah go back to the bay area go cal<br>and why you guys beat us in football<br>we still lead the reading record record<br>and in rowing so<br>i'll always hold that one out over you<br>but um<br>i think one of the things that has<br>become really clear to me from watching<br>this lecture is<br>as it explains why every time i talk to<br>christine about<br>somebody some teaching bit that we might<br>need to cover<br>in the department christine always says<br>oh i can do that i can do that<br>she has covered you know everything from<br>basic<br>biology introductory biology to genetics<br>to bioinformatics to neuro<br>no biological anthropology yet but i<br>have no doubt that<br>that indeed christine would be able to<br>step in<br>and showing no fear whatsoever<br>and great enthusiasm as we have all seen<br>tonight<br>take over whatever whatever challenge<br>she is faced with so uh i think really<br>her title<br>pretty much describes what we all know<br>about christine<br>is that every little thing she does<br>seems to be magic<br>and you know award-winning teacher<br>outstanding<br>researcher amazing academic citizen<br>finally very appropriately recognized by<br>the royal society of new zealand<br>you know she's she's a pretty impressive<br>colleague and i've gotten to know her a<br>bit more<br>in the last few years as she is my<br>deputy head of department<br>and i certainly have come to appreciate<br>all of those skills that she brings to<br>her role<br>as as a an academic as a deputy hod<br>as a member of the university and a<br>member of the general scientific<br>community and<br>just a well-rounded individual so um<br>going back to her her lessons learned<br>we'll go back to those first lessons<br>uh please and thank you so please<br>join me in thanking christine for an<br>outstanding uh ipl<br>and um allow me to give you this small<br>present of our appreciation<br>good evening to you all my name is paul<br>brunson and i'm the province chancellor<br>of health sciences<br>and i have two roles tonight the first<br>role is to thank you all for coming<br>these are very important events for the<br>university in our academic calendar<br>and they're made so special by everybody<br>coming and<br>not least people from outside the<br>university you're very welcome here<br>tonight<br>and my second duty is to invite you all<br>to join us for refreshments in the staff<br>club so please<br>in due course make your way over there<br>and continue with fellowship<br>and conversation but before we do that i<br>do think we should give our speaker<br>tonight<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
