are map makers and tapa<br>makers and so, Elam School of Fine Arts was<br>my first choice - my only choice actually<br>just based on its reputation so.<br>I decided to go to Elam because I wanted to<br>really seriously pursue my art career.<br>I guess I had these ideas that I would sort<br>of do<br>it on the side or as an amateur as a hobbyist<br>but I realised that that wasn't really for<br>me and I wanted to really dedicate my life<br>towards making art.<br>I chose Elam specifically because I knew it<br>had a really good reputation nationally and<br>internationally.<br>I was familiar with a lot of the lecturers<br>and their work and I really admired their<br>work and so I thought these are people that<br>I want to teach me.<br>I also sort of chose Elam because one of my<br>friends went through before me and I saw the<br>way that her work really matured and progressed<br>and became a lot more critical and that was<br>something that I really craved in my own practice.<br>So, Elam first year was honestly quite a scary<br>experience.<br>I came into it expecting it to be one thing<br>and I was completely shocked and surprised,<br>pleasantly so, by how diverse the range of<br>art-making practices that I engaged with were.<br>I had access to a lot of different workshops<br>and spaces that really pushed me to think<br>about my art in a critical way and to pursue<br>different techniques of making.<br>So, I came to Elam as a painter.<br>I thought that was something that I really<br>wanted to pursue, but then through this kind<br>of whirlwind of experimentation and constant<br>making in the first year, I really broadened<br>my perspective and ended up being a lot more<br>interested in sculpture, and installation,<br>and photography, and just this huge range<br>of different ideas and processes that I think<br>really pushed me as an artist.<br>In your first year, you're introduced into<br>four core courses: doing two studio practices,<br>one critical studies and one workshop-based<br>course.<br>Within the studio practices, you're introduced<br>into six different modes which is painting,<br>time-based performance, sculpture, creative<br>thinking, photography and printmaking.<br>And so, I guess when you introduce them to<br>those different practices and workshops, you're<br>also exploring your own sense of artistic<br>style and in that sense, is establishing,<br>I guess, your motive in your practice going<br>into second and third year.<br>So, just to unpack a technical term, 'crit',<br>which is essentially criticism or critique<br>of work and it sounds really challenging and<br>really negative, yeah?<br>But what it's about is about all of the artists<br>in the room sitting down and going through<br>a practice, which is presented through the<br>final work, and coming to - trying to unravel<br>an understanding of where the maker is coming<br>from, how it is received, what the engagement<br>with the work is.<br>So, it's really important for developing a<br>practice.<br>So, Elam has a huge variety of dedicated workshops<br>and spaces.<br>These include the screen printing studio with<br>fine arts presses, a digital hub with access<br>to audio, video, film and photographic equipment;<br>a printed meta hub; a ceramics workshop; a<br>woodworking workshop; metalworking workshop;<br>a foundry; a photography lab with darkroom<br>and lighting studio and, of course, studio<br>spaces where students can make their work.<br>And each of these spaces is run by a specialist<br>technician who basically help you - guide<br>you through the process of learning how to<br>use this equipment confidently and help you<br>realise some of your more crazy ideas.<br>So, I guess, coming in here first year you're<br>introduced to many students from different<br>high schools and you're all in one studio<br>interacting and I guess the fact that you<br>guys are all fresh from high school and just<br>from your own sort of walks of life, you sort<br>of gain a sense of a support system within<br>your peers and that, in a sense, is a community,<br>and you're progressively growing with each<br>other and supporting one another and working<br>in ways to, I guess, just get through the<br>year and nailing, you know, assessments and<br>hand in dates,<br>and I guess having that community foundation<br>and sense of unity is really essential to<br>getting through Elam, and I guess Elam has<br>its - has that sense of community and that<br>is a necessity in a sense, yeah.<br>Thanks, so - but both of you were - you didn't<br>have friends come with you from high school,<br>did you?<br>So, in terms of community, did you just kind<br>of have to put yourself out there?<br>How did this build for you?<br>How did you find your place within a community?<br>Was it natural or, you know, did you have<br>to put a lot of work in?<br>For me personally, my experience coming into<br>Elam was very easy flowing.<br>The University of Auckland had Tuākana, a<br>community which is a community for Māori<br>and Pacific students, helping them excel in<br>academic success, and so, I was very grateful<br>to have met Tuākana mentors and had this<br>space in Elam which devotes to Tuākana students<br>and helping them in their creative practice,<br>so very happy to have that sense of community<br>and those peers around me.<br>Whereas for me, it was a bit daunting because<br>I didn't know anyone really coming in here<br>and obviously it's quite hard to make friends<br>when you're trying to frantically make work<br>at the same time.<br>So for me, I joined the Bent group which is<br>a student-led group for queer students, and<br>we basically had sort of monthly, two weekly<br>meetings where we got together, talked about<br>queer issues, and how we were sort of situated<br>within the Elam hierarchy,<br>and this was really important for me because<br>it meant that I could interact with students<br>like me across year groups - it wasn't just<br>my year group - and sort of forged those connections<br>quite early on.<br>What's really interesting about that is that<br>Auckland is a super diverse city, yeah?<br>So, in terms of its population but also the<br>different communities that exist within it.<br>And what's lovely about the - what you're<br>talking about is there's both really strong<br>institutional support.<br>So, tuākana-teina is really critical for<br>that and it's about focusing on the different<br>experiences that different students bring<br>to the University<br>and how we can help everyone to succeed in<br>their own terms in the best way they can - and<br>academically, of course.<br>And then, it was really true.<br>I mean, Bent was such a great initiative because<br>of being student-led and being responsive.<br>So, I remember the first project that one<br>of you, one of the other members of Bent did<br>and it was the queering the curriculum stickers<br>that went up, and what was really great about<br>that was that it came from you and Nick and<br>some staff colleagues,<br>but we were able to hear it and go: this - this<br>is really pertinent for how student voice<br>can influence the ways in which we teach and<br>understand the student body and help, again,<br>different communities to achieve their best,<br>yeah?<br>So, I’m doing a double major in Pacific<br>Studies and Anthropology, and that in relation<br>to my art practice works hand in hand.<br>Most of the drive that I have in my artistic<br>practice is coming from Anthropology and Pacific<br>Studies,<br>so in that sense, it's manageable and it's<br>exciting and it's sometimes kind of nice to<br>get out of Elam and be out within the other<br>faculties.<br>So, I’d say in high school, it's a much<br>more directive approach where you're sort<br>of told these are the confines in which you<br>have to work.<br>Whereas at Elam, it's a lot more broad and<br>open and a collaborative kind of process with<br>your teacher.<br>So, they treat you as equals and treat your<br>ideas very seriously,<br>and as I said before, lots of learning that<br>you do is also with your peers,<br>and so it's this much smaller group environment<br>where you're really communicating and talking<br>about art ideas and not so much just carrying<br>out the task.<br>And also learning how to, like, present your<br>work is really important because you're not<br>just, you know, sticking it up on your wall<br>in your bathroom or something, right?<br>You're actually trying to present it in a<br>sort of official real space, and what that<br>means for your practice and for your work<br>is really important.<br>So, I've been at Elam for a long time and<br>one of the great joys is not only working<br>with students and getting to know students<br>when they're studying,<br>but then also following and supporting their<br>careers after they graduate.<br>Elam is one of the schools which has an embarrassment<br>of riches in terms of the contribution that<br>we have made to New Zealand art and culture,<br>and this is through really leading practitioners.<br>So, some of the young artists that I have<br>worked with and have followed their careers<br>are people like Luke Willis Thompson who was<br>a Turner Prize finalist in London two years<br>ago,<br>Kate Newby who has a really successful practice<br>in North America,<br>Fiona Connor who is based in Los Angeles and<br>has a really exciting social-based practice<br>there,<br>and also others like Zac Langdon-Pole who<br>won the BMW award,<br>Sarah Rose who works in Scotland.<br>The students who kind of have explored the<br>world and have the opportunity to have that<br>kind of global connect is really terrific.<br>That's possibly changing, but - so we also<br>have students who have been really successful<br>at a national level,<br>and the number of art galleries that constantly<br>exhibit student Elam graduate work is second<br>to none.<br>So, that's really clear in terms of what the<br>transition to being a successful working artist<br>involves.<br>But increasingly, what's really fascinating<br>is the way that the skills that you acquire<br>at Elam, particularly in terms of the critical<br>skills, the collaborative skills, the need<br>for communication, and fundamentally the creativity<br>that you bring to your work, is finding real<br>success for students in a diverse area of<br>different types of arenas.<br>So, one of the students I worked with, Imogen<br>Kerr, is now a specialist at Christie's in<br>London, and she's responsible for setting<br>up the new China market for Christie's and<br>the office there.<br>So, that's a really sophisticated, challenging<br>business job, but part of where she - what<br>she brings to that is she brings her understanding<br>as a painting student to that work and that<br>really develops how she's advancing that business.<br>And last year, I found out about a masters<br>graduate that I worked with who is now working<br>for the UN in an aid and development programme,<br>and so what she's bringing to that is her<br>understanding of what it is to be a maker<br>and someone who connects with community into<br>something of that scale and of that importance<br>to the world.<br>So, the range of types of activities that<br>students go into: contemporary artists, teachers<br>and educators, curators, arts administrators<br>in arts business, filmmaking - we have a lot<br>of filmmakers - all of these things are about<br>opening up the opportunities that creativity<br>brings,<br>and I think what we recognise in the current<br>climate is that those capacities are more<br>and more valuable to more and more workplaces,<br>so that's really super exciting.<br>So, that's a wee way off for you guys.<br>Just a wee way.<br>What are you - do you have plans?<br>What are you thinking that you might want<br>to be?<br>Very broad plans.<br>Yeah, I mean, I essentially want to become<br>a practising and exhibiting artist, right.<br>I don't just want to make work in isolation.<br>I kind of want to, like, find my voice in<br>the national and I guess global art scene.<br>At the same time, I’m also really interested<br>in gallery work.<br>So, I think that Elam, you know, having that<br>conjoint option and having sort of opportunities<br>to work in these two gallery spaces Projectspace<br>and George Fraser,<br>and you can become involved in the sort of<br>administration side of things there and curatorial<br>side of things.<br>I think those are really good opportunities<br>to sort of pursue that side of the art-making<br>process as well.<br>Yeah, definitely.<br>I think after Elam, after finishing a degree,<br>also continuing with postgrad is another option<br>I have after finishing Elam, and potentially<br>taking up another degree in the Arts faculty.<br>You know, diving into a more curatorial practice<br>and being able to engage and communicate with<br>the networks within New Zealand and the arts<br>organisations that are within our communities,<br>and I guess finding people, and I guess just<br>connecting with them and being able to establish<br>yourself within this scene.<br>And even like in, you know, I’ve only been<br>here for a year and a half, and I’ve already<br>had lots of opportunities to sort of reach<br>out into the broader art community and work<br>with artists and, yeah.<br>I find that really valuable and quite exciting<br>that that's already happening.<br>So, one of the important things for students<br>- incoming students is to know about the scholarships<br>that are offered at the University of Auckland.<br>And they come at different levels, whether<br>or not they're University scholarships, faculty<br>scholarships, or some Elam scholarships and<br>prizes,<br>and they're of a range of value.<br>So, some of them can be up to five thousand<br>dollars per year for three years while you<br>do your undergraduate programme, through to<br>smaller awards of fifteen hundred dollars.<br>But all of these help.<br>Of course, the main ones are the University<br>admission scholarships which are of a value<br>of twenty thousand dollars for students.<br>That's an extraordinary way to kind of kick<br>start your educational career.<br>But, not only in terms of first years, we<br>also have scholarships which are available<br>for students as they progress,<br>and so Maryjane's going to speak to one that<br>she received which is a really generous scholarship<br>of a value of 5,000 dollars?<br>Yes, yeah.<br>So, coming into my third year,I was definitely<br>low on resources, and so I was searching for<br>free money, I guess.<br>And so, I went to the Creative Arts website,<br>and there are a different range of scholarships<br>catering to postgrad students, undergrads,<br>first year to third year, and yeah, it was<br>amazing.<br>I got the scholarship and was able to purchase<br>paints, canvas, and sort of - and it was great<br>timing too, being under the Covid lockdown<br>and being able to still get resources from<br>these funds was just amazing, yeah.<br>So, one of the things that this year has taught<br>us is that we need to be really agile, and<br>we need to be focused on resilience.<br>It's kind of been a bit of an interesting<br>time for us in terms of how we've moved teaching<br>around, but it's also been something which<br>has come just ahead of a really substantial<br>change in the way that we're focusing the<br>BFA.<br>So, we're moving it to a three-year degree<br>which we hope will be more advantageous for<br>more students and increase the diversity and<br>access to education that we can provide.<br>And then within those three years, we've quite<br>radically overhauled the process by which<br>we step students through their learning,<br>and this was after an international external<br>review where we got some really helpful advice.<br>We did a lot of consultation.<br>We did a lot of soul searching and a lot of<br>thinking, and the staff have worked collectively<br>and with input from students to develop up<br>a new programme which we're genuinely excited<br>by.<br>The first year in some ways is not so different<br>because we still need to have that opportunity<br>to help students through a range of different<br>practices which have just simply not been<br>available to them, whether at high school<br>or personally.<br>So, things like sculpture or intermedia performative<br>work, these are things which are not typically<br>experienced.<br>And then, also with - even with things that<br>we know, so with painting, you know, part<br>of the experience of first-year painting is<br>to somewhat undo, but in order to add,<br>so we're re-learning things, going back to<br>fundamentals in some way.<br>So, what is painting as a material rather<br>than as a representational tool?<br>These kinds of things.<br>So, those stay within the main studio parts<br>of the first-year programme.<br>Critical studies, we're redirecting very consciously<br>towards what it means for artists.<br>So, it's not just about a whole series of<br>historical or theoretical information that<br>comes in on top of your practice.<br>It's something that we're keen to build from<br>within, so what you have is a more sophisticated<br>practice by the time you graduate.<br>Alongside those will also be just a couple<br>of creative careers case courses.<br>Now, these will be focused on different types<br>of outcomes that you might want to pursue<br>after you graduate.<br>Curatorial practice, I think, is really interesting<br>in that - what does it mean for an artist,<br>or someone who's really practised in the idea<br>of making objects and working materially,<br>to work with curating exhibitions, or events,<br>or festivals - the sorts of things which kind<br>of are around that connection with the world<br>for art.<br>And then the third part that you'll also be<br>choosing is around thematic areas of inquiry.<br>So, this is where we have large studio projects,<br>but they're open in terms of the media and<br>the approach that you might take, but they're<br>focused in particular areas,<br>whether that's in a suite of things which<br>combine with our research interests of staff<br>- so we have suites of indigenous practices,<br>courses about identity, about ecology, about<br>new technologies, about materiality,<br>and that just means that it gives you something<br>to land on in terms of how you're investigating<br>a particular project and how you want to realise<br>that in an artwork.<br>But of course, the reason you want to come<br>to art school is because you want to do your<br>own thing.<br>So, the final semester is what we call a capstone<br>project, and that is an independent studio<br>project that you invent, develop, experiment<br>with, and realise as the final part of your<br>BFA.<br>So, what we're doing is, clearly, we're helping<br>you with an arc of your practice from something<br>which is experimental, really fast turnover,<br>learning lots of things all the time,<br>right through to something where you then<br>are in a position to have a really concentrated<br>and developed independent project that really<br>speaks to who you have become as an artist<br>over the three years of your time at Elam.<br>We don't - no longer have a portfolio requirement,<br>and that's come about for two reasons.<br>One is that we got very clear advice that<br>the portfolio was a barrier for some students<br>and they were not applying because they were<br>worried about the portfolio and how we would<br>treat that.<br>And that was really of concern for us because<br>it meant that we were not getting the breadth<br>of students that we would want.<br>The other part was that we wanted to advance<br>the passion that students have for art-making<br>and to encourage and enable that and sometimes,<br>just for circumstances that you find yourselves<br>in, you've not been able to do one of the<br>main art type courses or design type courses<br>at high school.<br>And so, this again was presenting a barrier<br>which we thought was really challenging and<br>problematic.<br>What we do recommend though, of course, is<br>that you will find the transition easier and<br>you'll have a whole series of skills - conceptual<br>and material - which will be an advantage<br>to you if you take subjects like art, design,<br>the technical subjects, visual communication.<br>But, I imagine that for those of you that<br>are wanting to focus on art-making, these<br>won't be new to you and you will be undertaking<br>those courses if timetable allows, if you're<br>able to do them, if they're offered in your<br>schools.<br>So, that's really still really helpful, but<br>not doing them is not a barrier to succeeding<br>at Elam and that's something that we're really<br>focused on.<br>I think that one of the things which is interesting<br>about what we're trying to do with the new<br>changes is we're trying to serve different<br>types of students.<br>So Peter, you're really committed to in-depth<br>develop your artistic practice.<br>That doesn't go away.<br>That's still what we do.<br>And then Maryjane, you're focused on things<br>which you find the academic study helps enrich<br>and you bring to your practice which is also<br>really exciting.<br>What that means for us is that there's no<br>one way of doing a Fine Arts degree.<br>So, what we're focused on now is advancing<br>the conjoint options so that they're much,<br>much more expansive.<br>So, currently, we just have the one with Arts,<br>and Arts is great, and there's lots of different<br>types of majors that you can do but we're<br>expanding that to 11 different types of degrees<br>so we're across every faculty now, working<br>in partnership around these conjoint degrees.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
