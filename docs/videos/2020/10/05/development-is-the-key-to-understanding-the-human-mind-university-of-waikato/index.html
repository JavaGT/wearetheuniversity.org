He will also show how different types of information are understood differently - from the social world to how our vision develops as we get older.<br><br>With a focus on the human infant, and recently the human fetus, this public lecture will draw on Professor Reid's extensive research experience to illustrate how the human mind and brain work - and why you should care about it. Professor Reid will illustrate the development of the mind with a mix of methods from psychology and the neurosciences.<br><br>Professor Reid, a new appointment at Waikato University from Lancaster University in the UK, is currently the Head of School for Psychology. For more information on Professor Reid and his work please click here.<br><br>This 35-minute public lecture was held at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato in Hamilton on 15 September, 2020.  The Hamilton Public Lecture Series introduces our newest professors to the community and gives them a chance to demonstrate how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you for your attention we hope you<br>m<br>ladies and gentlemen good evening my<br>name is neil quickly i'm vice chancellor<br>of the university it's my pleasure<br>to welcome all of you to professor<br>vincent reed's<br>lecture this evening entitled<br>development is the key to understanding<br>because of the year that it has been<br>this is the first of our lectures this<br>year though<br>we have had plans to have a number<br>earlier<br>so it's wonderful to have all of you<br>here this evening<br>braving both our covert 19<br>level 2 restrictions and also the<br>weather<br>so it's my pleasure to introduce<br>professor vincent reed he left<br>new zealand to go on holiday in 1999<br>and he got stuck overseas for<br>approximately 20 years<br>before returning to take up the position<br>as<br>head of the school for the school of<br>psychology here<br>at the university of waikato vincent<br>returned to us here in august of 2019<br>professor reed is a noted developmental<br>psychologist<br>and brings with him a wealth of research<br>and management experience<br>professor reed completed his bachelor<br>and masters in psychology<br>at the university of auckland after<br>which he went to london where he studied<br>towards his phd under professor mark<br>johnson now head of department at<br>cambridge university<br>he then moved to germany working as a<br>research scientist at the<br>max planck institute for human cognitive<br>and brain<br>sciences before heading back to the<br>united kingdom<br>to durham university and then to<br>lancaster university<br>reed's area of research interest is<br>human development<br>in particular infants and fetuses<br>one of his biggest achievements is<br>showing that it is possible to explore<br>visual capabilities in the human fetus<br>before gestation<br>or sorry during gestation that's an<br>important difference<br>this was something that was thought to<br>be impossible previously<br>the majority of professor reed's work<br>has focused on how the infant brain<br>works and how infants learn new<br>information<br>particularly from other people his<br>findings have been used for a variety of<br>applications including the development<br>of epigenetic robotic systems in japan<br>and to make it easier to collect brain<br>data from children with epilepsy<br>his work has produced two spin-out<br>companies<br>and over his career vincent has<br>attracted over 25 million dollars<br>in research funding primarily from the<br>economic and social research council<br>the eu marie curie actions and via the<br>vincent and his wife gemma have been<br>keen to come home to new zealand for<br>some years<br>they appear to have timed it perfectly<br>managing to arrive<br>in new zealand before our borders closed<br>and before our lives were turned upside<br>down by<br>covert 19. so ladies and gentlemen<br>please join me in welcoming to the<br>podium to give this lecture<br>thank you so much neil for that very<br>kind introduction<br>uh and thank you all for being here uh<br>both of you<br>um this evening it's<br>you know i wanted to start off with<br>saying a few words in torreira but<br>unfortunately i<br>need to do a bit of work on that um so<br>maybe at my next<br>public lecture um i'll do one of those<br>so i thought i'd talk to you about two<br>things<br>effectively this is one big<br>advertisement for doing psychology at<br>waikato<br>so i'm going to talk about two things<br>one is about faces<br>one is about entrance and a little bit<br>of brain development<br>sort of on the way um and they're<br>actually it's quite useful because the<br>two<br>topics are the things that i found the<br>most interesting over the last 20 years<br>that i've been involved in<br>so that's why i called it development as<br>the key to understanding the human mind<br>and uh this image here this uh<br>incredibly beautiful young boy uh we'll<br>come back to it later on<br>because first i'm going to talk to you<br>about fetuses<br>why would you study a fetus why would a<br>fetus be remotely interesting<br>that has to be the first question and<br>the answer<br>is right here in this infographic<br>so by the time a baby is born<br>there are about three or four key things<br>that have already happened<br>that are rather important so the first<br>is that the autonomic nervous system<br>is already present and is already there<br>for people to understand it for<br>the fetus to utilize the second is that<br>motor systems are already online<br>and that's a key part of many elements<br>of development<br>thirdly and this is the bit that people<br>start to find a bit surprising<br>affective and temperamental states are<br>established basically elements of your<br>personality who you are<br>who you think about what you think about<br>all that sort of stuff<br>is already starting to be entrenched and<br>finally<br>um also the way in which you learn and<br>how you learn<br>as present during this time um<br>the point of this slide is to actually<br>show that there are there are feed<br>forward processes but also feedback<br>elements here that's what the sort of<br>the pointy arrows are all about<br>i i don't know why they've shaved sort<br>of the head off the woman here because<br>that's got nothing to do with fetuses or<br>indeed what this thing is down the<br>bottom um<br>so just ignore those um okay so<br>that's why you would want to study a<br>fetus because a lot of stuff happens<br>prior to birth<br>how do you study stuff with a fetus this<br>is where it gets tricky because it's<br>really hard to actually<br>understand what's going on given the<br>constraints of the fact that actually a<br>fetus is<br>inside and you want to see what fetuses<br>are doing<br>so this is a this is a study that when i<br>first saw it um<br>made my head explode uh and it's a very<br>simple study<br>uh this is an ultrasound of a fetus<br>and what this study did is they simply<br>just put an ultrasound<br>onto the abdomen of a pregnant woman to<br>see what was going on so it's<br>known as an observational study and what<br>they found was that the fetus<br>would actually open the mouth prior to<br>the hand<br>arriving to the mouth area and you think<br>what's so interesting about that<br>well what's interesting about that so<br>this is at the beginning of the third<br>trimester of pregnancy<br>um is that that means that there is a<br>rudimentary body scheme at present it<br>means that the fetus<br>has some idea of where their hand is in<br>space that it's about<br>to come in contact with the mouth and<br>it's anticipating that so that's what's<br>known as a self-produced<br>anticipatory action and that shows that<br>you actually have the framework for<br>motor function and an idea of a body<br>schema<br>which is something that we you know take<br>for granted as<br>grown-ups um you can show this you can<br>show it<br>using this sort of technology and i sort<br>of sat on this for a few years thinking<br>what else could you possibly do<br>given this so um this is fantastic<br>research<br>and if you don't believe me it's on the<br>slide in words<br>um so that means that it's a fact<br>um and you can't argue okay but there<br>are major constraints here<br>um constraint number one uh being<br>that this is an observational study it's<br>not an experiment<br>um if you really want to understand<br>what's going on you must do an<br>experiment you have to manipulate things<br>you have to<br>actually change the behavior of the<br>fetus in order to see if they can really<br>understand<br>anything so you can't make causal<br>conclusions<br>and you can't really have a full<br>understanding of what's going on<br>observational research is very useful<br>but it has<br>has its limits you must do an experiment<br>and<br>correlation does not equate to causation<br>of course<br>and despite that the last study i'm<br>going to present<br>is going to be correlational and i'll<br>so what is the evidence for fetal<br>learning<br>um and this is a there was a whole<br>series of studies in the 1980s<br>and they were in the early 1980s and<br>what they were doing was looking at<br>auditory processing<br>how does the fetus hear stuff and what<br>does it learn from it<br>and this is one that is a particular<br>favorite of mine<br>so this was published in a um a<br>well-known journal called science<br>and what they did is they did a study<br>where they<br>the poor mother had to read the cat and<br>hat two times a day for six weeks prior<br>to birth<br>and this was read again and again<br>then the baby was born and once the baby<br>was born they put a<br>uh a dummy or a pacifier of american<br>into the mouth of uh the baby<br>and uh using a transducer they could<br>measure sucking rate<br>so how quickly the the baby would suck<br>and uh<br>what they could do is that the<br>effectively the baby could control which<br>tape recorder would play<br>whether it was the the book the cat and<br>the hat<br>or they changed the nouns so it was the<br>dog in the bog something that sounded<br>quite similar but actually was a bit<br>different<br>and what they found was that babies<br>would always choose to<br>modify their sucking rate such that they<br>could actually hear the familiar story<br>and half the sample had the dog in the<br>bog during pregnancy and they preferred<br>that one<br>so people went hey that's really<br>interesting that means a fetus can learn<br>stuff and they can learn stuff about<br>language<br>um that makes that's really confusing um<br>how can they do that<br>so that's why people found it<br>interesting but there was a<br>there was a whole lot of these studies<br>that happened in the early 1980s and<br>then it sort of just<br>died off um in part because the<br>constraints of really understanding how<br>uh to present stimulator fetus this is<br>all auditory stimuli<br>um and there's only so much you can do<br>in that particular domain<br>so nonetheless i think you should be<br>very impressed<br>um because this is in the 1980s so after<br>all in the 1980s<br>they thought that power dressing was a<br>good idea<br>um the excess of hair spray was a good<br>thing<br>um and you know one hairdo at a time<br>destroying the world via cfcs um and<br>also<br>they you know they thought rogenomics<br>was good<br>i might put that in there for neil so<br>and we'll come back to this<br>okay so we will return to this because<br>it's fundamental for the second half of<br>this evening very important<br>okay so there's only so much you can do<br>with the auditory stimuli<br>most research with infants and with<br>children actually uses<br>visual stimuli so you present something<br>to the infant and you see how they<br>process that information whether they<br>choose to prefer to look at something<br>those sorts of things and if you look at<br>a developmental biology textbook or a<br>developmental psychology textbook it<br>will<br>it will even not mention uh vision at<br>all in a fetus<br>or it will say nothing doing it's dark<br>in there and this is adaptive this is a<br>good thing it's dark because the visual<br>system needs that to develop<br>so it was off limits for reasons related<br>to ethics<br>until 2011 when someone called marco<br>produced a model that was very<br>interesting and effectively what the<br>model<br>did was to highlight the amount of light<br>that enters the uterus<br>so here we have his model um<br>and so this is the the thickness of<br>maternal tissue here<br>um in the second half of the third<br>trimester of<br>pregnancy most women tend to have<br>between thirteen forty millimeters of<br>so between thirteen forty millimeters of<br>tissue<br>uh and what he effectively did was<br>calculate the amount of light you get if<br>you're standing in direct sunlight<br>if you were outdoors but in shadows um<br>or all the way back to here<br>if you were indoors but with artificial<br>light and he calculated how the light<br>was attenuated<br>going through maternal tissue with<br>clothing<br>and he worked out that actually most<br>fetuses can see stuff<br>in other words there's visual processing<br>that's going on<br>in the uterus during the third trimester<br>and i thought maybe we can start to look<br>at how vision develops<br>in fetuses but what can you possibly do<br>that's the question<br>so i thought about the sorts of<br>paradigms you would need to actually<br>induce behaviours in a fetus so that you<br>could overtly measure that using<br>something like ultrasound now<br>there's a series of very classic studies<br>that have been done by<br>mark johnson my supervisor and others<br>and<br>they're very elegant and also very<br>simple take a newborn<br>place them on your lap and then in the<br>periphery of their visual field present<br>them with a stimulus and just<br>move the stimulus away from the central<br>fixation area and track the amount of<br>time that<br>the newborn will follow very simple<br>very overt behavior and what you get<br>with this kind of study<br>um rotate so for those of you that can't<br>do mental rotation i've done that for<br>you that's<br>sort of um what you get is actually the<br>uh a newborn prefer to spend more time<br>engaging with<br>a face or face like stimuli compared to<br>something that's scrambled<br>compared to something that's blank they<br>will move their eyes move their head a<br>bit more so it's a very over sort of<br>behavior<br>it's not faces per se the underlying<br>mechanism<br>is actually far more primitive and<br>simple than that it's anything<br>where there's more information in the<br>upper than the lower visual field<br>so if you present a capital t to a<br>newborn baby they find that interesting<br>when contrasted to a capital t that's<br>inverted<br>very rudimentary mechanism and our faces<br>happen to have the same construction<br>um and babies follow your face around so<br>there you are<br>so we had a potential method that we<br>could utilize<br>from the the well-developed neonatal<br>literature that we could then implement<br>with fetuses potentially<br>and that's precisely what we did so<br>this is an image of kirsty so dr kirsty<br>dunn my collaborator<br>and what she's doing is she's first<br>measuring the depth of maternal tissue<br>which will determine the<br>uh the strength of the light that's<br>required um<br>an ultrasound is being taken at the same<br>time and then she's measuring that head<br>turn and we're recording it and then<br>looking at it afterwards as well<br>that was one part of that study the<br>other part of the study was to actually<br>work out<br>how the light changes when it interfaces<br>with<br>maternal tissue so effectively what you<br>have is you have<br>uh the the light is scattered the light<br>is<br>uh attenuated and somewhat blurred<br>because of things like adipose<br>so fat um and so what you end up with<br>in this model is you still get something<br>that looks roughly face like<br>so this is not a face so in the<br>literature but things being face like<br>which is simply that<br>three dots in that configuration so you<br>have one that looks like a face<br>one that does not and we would expect<br>that there would be<br>more attention paid to the upper than<br>the lower of those two<br>so just to sort of summarize that in an<br>infographic from a disreputable magazine<br>but it's my favorite infographic<br>what we have is we have um it's not<br>actually fetus on that's a photograph of<br>baby but anyway<br>what we have is we've got the three dots<br>and they've done the upright the<br>inverted<br>we present them use the ultrasound and<br>we move the stimuli and we measure the<br>head movement<br>it's really that simple this is a sort<br>of<br>4d ultrasound that we had<br>so very simple sort of refresh rate<br>and what you do when you're coding it<br>you don't know whether the head's moving<br>to the left or the right or where<br>they're stimulating<br>presented so you're blind and then you<br>just sort of measure whether or not the<br>head will rotate to the left or it will<br>rotate to the right<br>and indeed what we find what we found<br>was that<br>the fetuses would prefer to engage with<br>the the face like<br>stimuli um on the left hand side so look<br>more towards it<br>than uh when it was inverted we weren't<br>sure a fetuses would actually find<br>the stimuli actively um aversive<br>uh so no one had actually done this sort<br>of thing before<br>and so we also measured without the<br>fetus would turn their head in the<br>opposite direction<br>um and that's why there's the away<br>measurements<br>and what we find there is that actually<br>um they didn't seem too fast they<br>preferred to attend to it and move<br>towards it so that's why we have that<br>sort of a way measurement as well<br>so that that came out<br>and<br>it came out um the same day that james<br>comey was uh presenting to congress<br>about<br>trump and russia and um<br>so the the top ten uh items on on google<br>um our data analytics team at the<br>university um<br>the top nine were about that and the<br>tenth was us<br>and it was actually on the eve of the um<br>the british general election<br>and we managed to hold them off in the<br>top ten for 24 hours<br>so which is probably a good thing<br>and the thing is that um over a billion<br>people sort of engage with that and i<br>think it's because the idea that<br>fetuses look at faces seems just uh odd<br>and maybe it's something unusual for the<br>news cycle but hopefully you have a more<br>of an understanding of why we<br>decided to do that but i've only gone<br>through some of it<br>because the question for me is actually<br>what is the mechanism<br>um so this is a an image from<br>aristotle's masterpiece<br>um aristotle's masterpiece was not<br>written by aristotle and it's not a<br>masterpiece<br>uh it was written about 1650 and who<br>knows who rubs it<br>it's basically a midwifery journal<br>that's relatively salacious<br>um and this is actually<br>uh we had a secondhand bookshop and uh<br>so<br>gemma had a second bookshop in art<br>gallery and she<br>came in the door one day and she said<br>you might find that interesting<br>and i did so but nonetheless illustrates<br>something i think is quite important<br>which is what's the mechanism what's the<br>potential mechanism here for why<br>you get this preference to attend to<br>certain types of visual information when<br>you're a fetus<br>so six month you have a breach position<br>upright seventh month you do and the<br>eighth month it's factually incorrect<br>that doesn't happen<br>on the eighth month so ignore that and<br>in the ninth month<br>you have a cephalic presentation upside<br>down<br>so what needs to be known here is that<br>there are two things<br>one is the um whether or not this is<br>something that's uh<br>what you might call a natural<br>genetically driven or if environment<br>somehow play some factor<br>and you can sort of look at that and<br>we're hoping to look at that<br>using monte carlo modeling of how light<br>changes during the third trimester<br>how much gets and how it changes as a<br>function of pregnancy<br>and you really need to do that in order<br>to understand what's going on but it can<br>be done<br>and let's just hope that marsden bit<br>comes through from the second round<br>so it would be nice to know the other<br>part of what we want to do and that work<br>is to develop this work further so this<br>is a study that was led by<br>my good friend and colleague tim donovan<br>and taking the data that i had but<br>adding some more<br>and what you see on the right hand side<br>here are some 4d<br>images of the fetus<br>now on the left hand side you have a 2d<br>scan<br>of the ultrasound on the right hand side<br>you cannot see the eyes<br>so that it just doesn't have the level<br>of resolution required to see what's<br>going on<br>but on the left hand side what you can<br>see is you can actually see<br>nothing if i do that<br>you can see within the echolocatic<br>eyeball the orbital socket you can<br>actually see the protein within the lens<br>of the eye<br>and this is actually really important<br>because that means you can actually see<br>where the eye is moving and so this was<br>the first study to actually show<br>oculomotor control<br>in a thesis we weren't sure at this<br>point in time whether or not you<br>actually have<br>the head and the eyes fixed in a rigid<br>disposition or if the eyes can move<br>independent of the head<br>and this shows yes they can they can<br>move those eyes in that way<br>um so our aim is to actually do eye<br>tracking uh with a fetus and eye<br>tracking is a standard thing that you<br>can do<br>with uh infants and it tells you all<br>sorts of really interesting things so to<br>move that into the fetal domain would be<br>really quite useful<br>so that's the first sort of bit that i<br>want to talk about<br>the second bit is what i call the in<br>farns problem<br>it's not the infant problem you're<br>thinking vincent she misspelled infant<br>so infants actually means without speech<br>in latin which is where the word infant<br>comes from<br>how do you get anything remotely useful<br>out of this that's the question um<br>and that's a problem um so this uh<br>yes these people are in the audience um<br>so how do you get anything out of this<br>um and it's very hard what you can do is<br>you can look at what's going on in the<br>brain<br>so that makes things a lot more useful<br>and now<br>this is a summary of site 203 in two<br>weeks if you are a<br>psych 203 student come to the lecture or<br>at least watch it<br>because this is a very short summary so<br>what we have is we have an<br>electrocephalogram that's measuring<br>brain activity we're very lucky as<br>psychologists because on the outside<br>the surface of the brain we have a thing<br>called the cortex now what the cortex<br>does is lots of things that are very<br>useful<br>for information processing um<br>yay that's lucky because if they were<br>deep structures we couldn't measure them<br>the fact that's on the outside is useful<br>because you can put electrodes on the<br>outside of the surface of the scalp<br>and you can pick up what those neurons<br>are doing in the brain<br>so here we have a baby the baby is tied<br>up to<br>an eeg um it's amplified to make it big<br>and then you get a signal<br>um now that's the top part<br>electrocephalogram<br>the bottom part of this image is you've<br>got a<br>boom box on the left and it's presenting<br>a stimulus<br>beep beep beep every time it beeps you<br>can see the stimulus and your<br>electrocephagram<br>when you add those all together what you<br>end up with effectively is a way of<br>smoothing the data so that it's only<br>related to<br>how the infant is hearing that tone that<br>beep<br>so this thing down the bottom is known<br>as event related potential the event<br>being the stimulus<br>that beeping noise and what it does is<br>it breaks<br>up and fractionates perception and<br>cognitive function that's what makes it<br>so useful<br>so all of these different components the<br>elan the p200 the n400 the p600<br>there are many many of them and all of<br>them are related to<br>how an infant or an adult processes<br>information whether that is perceptual<br>whether it is<br>cognitive and they will tell you<br>different things very useful<br>um with infants this is what you tend to<br>get for a visual<br>stimulus the visual presentation<br>and so babies are not as super fast<br>as us as adults everything's a lot<br>slower their brains don't go quite so<br>quickly<br>so there are two things i want to point<br>out here one is something called the nc<br>the nc is a a negative going component<br>and this relates to attention how much<br>attention an infant's pain to something<br>when they see it<br>the other thing is the positive slow<br>wave this tonic sort of effect that's<br>much later in time<br>and i'll come back to that later on so<br>just bear that in mind while i go<br>through some images for you<br>so here's a study that i didn't do<br>because i was quite young<br>so i didn't do it so this is by cutis<br>and hillyard and they discovered<br>something that actually was then it has<br>been explored more than any other<br>brain potential and this is called the<br>n-400<br>so cool because it's negative and it's<br>amplitude and it's 400 milliseconds<br>after the presentation of the stimulus<br>so if i say something to you like the<br>pizza was too hot to eat<br>you think that makes sense if i say the<br>peaks was too hot to drink<br>when i say the word drink your brain<br>produces a little in 400 and if i say<br>your<br>the pizza was too hot um too hot to cry<br>then<br>you'll produce a very large m400 so the<br>n400 is proportionally distributed as a<br>function of how<br>uh semantics that you've built up in<br>your representation has been altered in<br>other words you expect<br>a pizza to be too hot to eat you don't<br>expect it to cry pizzas don't cry<br>and what's interesting is that semantic<br>incongruity can be separated from other<br>forms of<br>expectation or deviation so it's just to<br>do with semantics<br>meaning how you understand things really<br>interesting<br>okay so that's language babies<br>not so much with language in terms of<br>early development maybe as toddlers<br>but if we want to really understand what<br>infants are doing and<br>give us some idea of how the mind is<br>structured and how it develops<br>then you've got to look at something<br>else and so i was interested in action<br>because infants they know a lot about<br>action what other people do how they do<br>things<br>so what we did in this study is we<br>presented three images which effectively<br>mirror elements of a sentence<br>um actions and uh language are actually<br>highly<br>uh correlated in terms of their<br>structure how they fit together<br>um i can't go into that now but it's<br>very interesting<br>but effectively what you have is you<br>have a context an image like this<br>you have an action that's being<br>performed like so and then you have<br>an action execution it's in the mouth a<br>very simple sentence basically<br>so you can present that or you can<br>alternatively present something<br>along these lines where in the third<br>image you don't expect that<br>it violates your your anticipation and<br>you can do this with all sorts of things<br>and in fact it's a good idea because you<br>must present these things<br>many times in order to get a measure of<br>what's going on in a brain<br>i think you get the idea so lots of them<br>so it's either a<br>b and c or a b and d and you sit there<br>and you watch lots of these<br>now if you're an adult what you get is<br>you get an n400 component<br>um now we didn't know that before so<br>that's nice<br>my laser pointers died but anyway um<br>an n400 you get one to action<br>and so that means that semantics in<br>terms of expectation are present for the<br>actions not just for language<br>and i thought haha we can do this with<br>entrance now let's see what happens with<br>an infant who's<br>very socially adept and developed and<br>what we find are two things<br>we see this big nc component which i've<br>now plotted upwards to confuse you<br>um and also we get in these these p<br>components down the bottom these are<br>electrodes in the parietal region these<br>three at the bottom you get<br>late in the day um this n-400 component<br>so they also have an n-400<br>let's see if a seven-month-old can do<br>this so we again<br>get this nc effect where they find so<br>they find when the food goes in the<br>mouth<br>interesting because they're babies right<br>and that's something babies really<br>food and babies quite like middle-aged<br>men<br>so food and babies they go together<br>a tent you get a measure of attention<br>but at seven months<br>you get no n400 so in other words they<br>don't represent things in terms of<br>semantics but they do attend towards<br>things which is why<br>behaviorally they look like they can<br>actually be socially adept<br>so if we do the same thing with a<br>five-month-old<br>what we find here is that we find no<br>some evidence for semantics<br>no evidence or attention but what we do<br>find is we find<br>another effect the positive slow wave<br>which i talked about before<br>and what this does is it differentiates<br>context so that's<br>the slow wave is this low sort of tonic<br>effect late in the day<br>um that occurs what it means is that the<br>baby is picking up what's going on<br>um they are discriminating but they<br>don't know anything about the semantics<br>or representation they're not they don't<br>even differentially attend<br>but they're just seeing that there's a<br>difference so at five months of age<br>babies can do that so you see how we're<br>sort of building a sort of a<br>map of cognitive architecture as a<br>function of development um<br>qed that's my lecture<br>so you can do more with these things<br>as a function of development so one<br>thing that we did do is we replicated<br>the effect<br>we found this n400 component again<br>for the unexpected with another sample<br>but then we let the babies grow up<br>so from nine months they went to 18<br>months of age and then we measured their<br>language function<br>so to see whether or not an infant had a<br>certain<br>level of capacity in terms of language<br>and then on the basis of that<br>we divided our sample into those that<br>actually had uh<br>relatively high performing language<br>capacities in terms of production and<br>comprehension<br>or if they were relatively speaking not<br>so good at those things<br>and what we found when we actually went<br>back to the nine month old data<br>was that actually it was only the high<br>language group that actually produced<br>this n400 component<br>uh so these things here just to confuse<br>you this is a difference wave across the<br>surface of the scalp that's what these<br>sort of blobby things look like<br>and the the sort of little uh i don't<br>know french mustache thing<br>that's the the parietal um sort of<br>electrodes that we were looking at<br>and the negativity that's blue um shows<br>that it's negative and that's the one<br>for the high language group<br>so in other words it's only those babies<br>that have the high language at 18 months<br>happen to actually<br>differentiate at the level of semantics<br>the action at nine months of age<br>so what does that tell us<br>well you can't be causal you can't say<br>understanding action<br>and my months means at 18 you're very<br>good at language<br>there's just a relationship we can't say<br>anything because it's a<br>it's a correlation i did say that i<br>would say there'd be a correlation near<br>the end<br>so i've taken you through a few sorts of<br>things here<br>but i think that there are a few<br>conclusions that i need to sort of go<br>through with you<br>the first is that uh perception and<br>perceptual mechanisms actually<br>fundamentally alter cognition<br>so the way that you see things the way<br>that you hear things change the way that<br>you then think about things<br>and many of these things are in the<br>foundational period<br>during the prenatal period rather than<br>postnatal<br>so there's all that sort of evidence<br>some of which i've shown you today<br>the other thing is that development<br>actually happens to be a<br>mechanism you can use it as a tool um<br>development's interesting in its own<br>right i find babies are fun<br>but you can learn an awful lot about how<br>the mind is structured how the mind<br>works<br>through using development as a mechanism<br>to understand what's going on<br>in terms of how our minds are structured<br>so you can understand how the mind works<br>so<br>tonight i've sort of showed you you have<br>a context<br>for attention semantics then action<br>related to language capacities and they<br>all sort of layer on top of each other<br>in ways that are<br>functionally distinct so<br>what you can conclude from this um are<br>those things however i suspect<br>what's going to happen is that you're<br>going to go home and in six months time<br>someone says do you remember that public<br>lecture<br>and you'll say oh yeah most jokes<br>produce an n400<br>so i need to say thank yous first before<br>i run away<br>the first is to my family and especially<br>to gemma for putting up with me<br>then my friends who happen to be my<br>collaborators<br>technicians are good research<br>participants are wonderful<br>and then the people who very kindly gave<br>us funding<br>um so there are lots of those uh i would<br>like to thank the university of waikato<br>and also the school of psychology<br>because um you know i sort of<br>came in and they're just so very<br>welcoming and that's been wonderful<br>so thank you very much and then all of<br>you for being here<br>and these very sort of uncertain times<br>um<br>my elder brother did tell me that i was<br>always going to sell out<br>but i don't think he meant it was sort<br>of under you know<br>covered regulations with a hundred um<br>and so here we are he's right<br>um so thank you all very much and now um<br>my name is alison kirkman it's my<br>pleasure as pro vice chancellor<br>representing the division of arts law<br>psychology and social<br>sciences just to thank professor reed<br>for his presentation i now can't see him<br>but<br>oh good thank you vincent for a<br>fascinating lecture<br>about a topic that affects us all<br>and daily and for which we mostly take<br>for granted<br>professor reed has introduced us to the<br>what he called fascinating world and i<br>agree<br>with him of fetal neurological<br>development<br>in particular perception and cognition<br>the question of what the fetus is able<br>to perceive and what stage of<br>development<br>is probably a general question that many<br>of us are aware of<br>through some of the material in the<br>public media and i have a question for<br>vincent when we get out to the<br>bar because i'm really interested in in<br>the playing of music<br>and vincent talked about auditory<br>stimuli<br>at the beginning of his session so i'm<br>keen to follow that up with him<br>but he also talked about how<br>a newborn baby recognizes faces<br>so tonight what he did was provide us<br>with the science behind these general<br>questions<br>many of us ask when we're thinking about<br>babies and fetuses and also why this<br>information is important<br>i was wondering about that in 40 as well<br>when i was looking at professor reed's<br>presentation before this event and i<br>must say that<br>having him present has helped me<br>enormously from having read the<br>presentation earlier<br>he's provided complex research to us<br>in an accessible and understandable way<br>and this is a mark of an excellent<br>researcher and teacher so thank you<br>vincent<br>this now concludes the formal part of<br>the evening<br>and i thank all of you for attending in<br>person<br>and also those of you who were going to<br>be watching my live stream in the<br>lecture theater and i'm not sure if<br>you're there still<br>or you're here but thank you to<br>everybody who's listening<br>and there'll also be an opportunity to<br>listen later again<br>professor reed will be moving to the<br>opus bar<br>and i'm sure he'll be happy to answer<br>any specific questions<br>as long as you maintain your distance<br>from him<br>the opus bar as i said will open open<br>for refreshments and i remind everybody<br>else who's not<br>asking vincent questions to also<br>continue<br>to maintain social distancing as level 2<br>requires<br>i should also let you know that the next<br>hamilton public lecture is on the<br>6th of october and the presenting<br>professor<br>is professor albert biffett<br>originally from spain because some of<br>you might have thought i<br>pronounced his name incorrectly because<br>i think it's up there oh no it's not so<br>you didn't<br>and i didn't need to say that however<br>professor albert buffett is from spain<br>but he's currently with the school of<br>computing and mathematical sciences<br>and he will be speaking on on the 6th of<br>october<br>so now i'll ask you again to thank<br>professor reed<br>and then he'll leave with the vice<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
