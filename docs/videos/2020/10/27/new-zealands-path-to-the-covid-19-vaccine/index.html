introduce the<br>panelists for this discussion on<br>vaccines<br>and specifically what does the pathway<br>to a vaccine look like<br>in terms of having an accessible<br>effective and most of all safe vaccine<br>against covert 19.<br>new zealand's response to the pandemic<br>has been rated amongst the best in the<br>world<br>that's heartening but we now appreciate<br>that this is a long game and that an<br>effective vaccine<br>is key to a return to the new normal for<br>new zealand and for the world<br>the worldwide race to develop a vaccine<br>has seen more than<br>300 vaccine candidates in development<br>and nearly 50 reaching human trials<br>the hope and i would emphasize hope is<br>that we might see a vaccine towards the<br>middle of 2021<br>you'll be aware that we have work on<br>vaccines underway in new zealand<br>and perhaps more importantly the<br>government has been<br>entering into agreements with some of<br>the leading international vaccine<br>initiatives<br>to secure supply for the country it's<br>far from clear<br>how all this will play out however we<br>have several panelists in this<br>discussion<br>who can shed some light on this our<br>experts today<br>are professor john fraser who is the<br>dean of the faculty of medical and<br>health sciences<br>at the university of auckland the<br>largest health research<br>and professional training institution in<br>new zealand<br>john is an immunologist whose work has<br>led to the now<br>widely accepted model of how super<br>antigens bring about<br>massive disruption in our immune systems<br>john is a fellow of the royal society of<br>new zealand<br>associate professor nikki turner is the<br>director of the national<br>immunisation advisory centre hosted by<br>the university<br>the centre is a national organization<br>leading research on diseases that can be<br>prevented by vaccine<br>and is an education on the benefits<br>and risk of immunization nikki was<br>also a member of the who strategic<br>advisory group of experts on<br>immunization<br>and chair of the measles and rubella<br>elimination subcommittee<br>from 2015 to 2019.<br>helen patusis harris is an associate<br>professor in the university school of<br>population health<br>a vaccinologist helen chairs the world<br>health organization's<br>global advisory committee on vaccine<br>safety<br>and carries out research on vaccine<br>safety<br>and efficacy they will be talking with<br>emile<br>donovan let's begin with what is a<br>vaccine<br>vaccines come in many many different<br>guys's they've been around for a very<br>very long time<br>the history of vaccinology and vaccines<br>goes back several hundred years<br>in fact even further than that but<br>essentially all of vaccine is<br>is a means by which you stimulate the<br>immune system<br>with a pathogen whether it's a virus or<br>a bacteria without actually causing the<br>infection<br>so you're almost fooling the immune<br>system into thinking that it's got the<br>infection<br>and it responds appropriately and<br>provides that protection<br>so one of the most beautiful things<br>about our immune system is that it<br>adapts and changes over time it becomes<br>better and better<br>so the more you drive it with that<br>antigen the better it becomes to the<br>point where you can provide<br>quite long lasting immunity against that<br>the original pathogen<br>and the hope of course is that pathogen<br>doesn't then change itself because it<br>wants to escape that immune response<br>is cover 19 a particularly difficult<br>disease<br>to develop a vaccine for that's a really<br>good question if i<br>if you ask me that question six months<br>ago i would have said<br>yes i think today i would say it's<br>relatively straightforward now the<br>reason i say that is because it's a<br>relatively simple virus<br>it's called a coronavirus and it's<br>called a coronavirus because when you<br>look at the electron microscope<br>there's a beautiful corona ring around<br>the outside of the<br>the bit that holds the dna of the um the<br>nucleic acid<br>and that corona is a single protein<br>called the spike protein and that's the<br>thing that everybody's focusing on<br>because that's the protein on the<br>outside of the virus that the virus uses<br>to stick<br>to the cells that it infects and those<br>cells are typically the cells that line<br>the respiratory tract the nose the<br>throat<br>and in particular the lungs and there's<br>a receptor on those cells in the lungs<br>that the virus binds to<br>the thing is that the virus binds very<br>very tightly it's like<br>velcro if you can imagine velcro binding<br>and sticking really tightly that's just<br>what the virus does<br>and it uses that spike protein on the<br>outside to stick<br>so most of the vaccines that have been<br>developed today really focus<br>on that spike protein that one protein<br>that it's used and the idea is that if<br>you can make<br>antibodies insufficient in quantities<br>and with high enough affinity that they<br>will bind to that spike protein<br>as soon as the virus enters the body<br>then the virus can't bind to the cells<br>and the virus dies and you don't get<br>infected so that's what we refer to as<br>neutralizing<br>immunity or protective immunity and<br>that's the thing that all vaccines try<br>and do is to generate that<br>protective immunity that neutralizing<br>immunity in the shortest possible time<br>with the least amount of of<br>antigen required to stimulate the immune<br>response so that's one of the key<br>elements in designing vaccines is trying<br>to make it<br>sufficiently easy to produce so you can<br>produce enough<br>doses of it to vaccinate a large number<br>of people and that's the the scale-up<br>process that's involved in<br>vaccine development once a vaccine is<br>developed<br>and produced on mass how many doses will<br>new zealand<br>need to achieve what it wants to achieve<br>i think my two colleagues are probably<br>better<br>than that place to answer that i guess<br>that really<br>depends on what you want the outcome to<br>be so<br>it is very likely that there will only<br>be limited supplies initially<br>so the outcome in a new zealand<br>environment where currently we have no<br>community transmission<br>would be to try and reduce the spread<br>into new zealand so we'd focus on the<br>border<br>border protection first then we'd be<br>focusing on frontline healthcare<br>professionals<br>and then you'd start stepwise depending<br>on supplies<br>vaccinating those who are at highest<br>risk first and we know from this viruses<br>very similar to the flu virus that you'd<br>focus on the elderly<br>those who've got compromised immune<br>systems so you'd step wise release it<br>through the population<br>the ultimate aim would be to vaccinate<br>enough of the population<br>to ensure enough immunity and then the<br>virus couldn't spread but that's quite a<br>long way off it depends<br>on vaccine supply and it depends on how<br>the vaccines ultimately act<br>when they're used in the community i<br>suppose that's the advantage of being an<br>island nation is that we can pinpoint<br>the most likely points of entry and try<br>to shore those up<br>that's right castle yes the large moat<br>the urgency that a vaccine be develops<br>is probably unprecedented i would<br>imagine in the world of<br>vaccinology anyway we are effectively<br>asking you to build a skyscraper in<br>three weeks<br>blindfolded uh but the most important<br>aspect of any vaccine surely is that it<br>be<br>safe you talk about serious adverse side<br>effects the possibility of serious<br>adverse side effects<br>what are we talking about there we're<br>talking about things that that<br>probably going to result in a<br>hospitalization<br>and of course there's a huge array of<br>these kind<br>kinds of health conditions that arise<br>normally all the time in the population<br>the challenge is to to determine is<br>there<br>is a vaccine increasing the risk for<br>this or not are we seeing what we would<br>normally expect to see<br>or does this seem to be an elevated risk<br>and that's the sort of<br>investigation that we we continue after<br>we start using the vaccine and we<br>should be able to monitor that in almost<br>real time<br>generally a vaccine will take 10 to 15<br>what is the acceptable level of risk in<br>a normal vaccine and how can we possibly<br>replicate that when everything is on<br>double fast forward like it is now the<br>reason it it takes so long and<br>traditionally takes so long is it's an<br>incredibly expensive process and i think<br>people probably understand that now<br>seeing some of the numbers bandied<br>around<br>and that's often on on the company<br>that's developing it you know it takes<br>over a billion often over two billion<br>dollars to get a vaccine through that<br>process<br>and when they go through the first phase<br>they need to sort of sit down and go how<br>does this look yes we'll get the<br>approval of all the boards and things<br>we'll move to the next phase<br>and that's looking pretty good so then<br>really big approvals because that's a<br>lot of lots of money<br>move to the next phase that's very time<br>consuming and hugely risky<br>a hugely risky business so what's<br>happening this time<br>is actually overlapping these phases so<br>money is not such a problem<br>right now overlapping these phases and<br>also<br>overlapping the process where the<br>regulatory agencies<br>assess everything that's going on and<br>that's from checking out the facility<br>that's going to make it at scale<br>it's checking out all the processes of<br>the trials and it's not doing that at<br>the<br>end it's doing that all the way along<br>so when the trials get to a point where<br>they think they actually have enough<br>information<br>to inform a decision<br>the regulatory agencies will be ready uh<br>to complete their assessments but i i<br>always thought<br>one of the things about clinical trials<br>that people have<br>probably forgotten to mention is the<br>fact that the longer out the clinical<br>trial goes the more sure you<br>are that the vaccine is going to work so<br>what you look for<br>in years beyond is what we call<br>re-infections<br>so you keep monitoring people who've<br>been vaccinated to see how many of them<br>actually get re-infected<br>and when they get reinfected which tells<br>you how long that vaccine is working for<br>and of course you know you can't<br>substitute time for those taxes<br>those types of studies so that's the<br>reason why vaccines take so long to be<br>developed and approved let's talk about<br>herd immunity<br>herd immunity has a bad reef at the<br>moment nerd immunity's pr team is<br>not happy with sweden no not immunity is<br>good<br>well that's what i was coming to i<br>should always had a bad rap there's a<br>bit of a public<br>misnomer around a lot of this um they're<br>getting very confused do you want to<br>speak to children<br>you know herd immunity just reflects the<br>fact that you have a large<br>portion of your population who have<br>developed immunity how they've developed<br>that immunity is the question here<br>but getting to herd immunity is what we<br>all want<br>because we want to see this virus be<br>relegated to the<br>you know the thing that pops up once in<br>a while and causes<br>relatively low degree of concern so<br>getting to herd immunity is what we all<br>want<br>the question is how you get there and<br>you know<br>are you prepared to take the risks of<br>as a means of ensuring that the rest of<br>the population gets there as fast as<br>possible and of course<br>some nations as we know have taken<br>different views on how to do that<br>our nation has taken approach where we<br>want to keep ourselves<br>completely free<br>that raises some issues about<br>should the virus progress rapidly<br>overseas and herd immunity starts to be<br>reached in some countries we will still<br>be<br>completely naive and so we will always<br>have to have the concern around<br>ensuring our borders are closed until<br>there is some<br>time when this country can achieve that<br>level of herd immunity<br>well of course once we develop a vaccine<br>we then face the issue of producing<br>and distributing it and so let's talk a<br>bit now about how new zealand is<br>positioned in that sense we'll bring in<br>dr nikki turner<br>if we assume that a vaccine<br>passes through final trials and is<br>available perhaps next year<br>where is new zealand positioned in terms<br>of a roll out<br>yeah so new zealand's not ready<br>currently but there is an enormous<br>amount of work going in<br>in fact the national strategy is to be<br>prepared<br>for vaccine availability even by the<br>first quarter of next year<br>so there's a lot of work going into this<br>at this stage<br>i think there's two big considerations<br>that um<br>we have to put on the table in the first<br>is that we're planning for a vaccination<br>campaign<br>prior to the final understanding of<br>which vaccinations we'll use and how<br>much we will have<br>so the big challenge for new zealand is<br>to start communicating now<br>for a campaign that we're not entirely<br>sure what's going to look like<br>the second big commitment from new<br>zealand is<br>the equity issue that this is<br>a virus that particularly affects some<br>people more than others<br>traditionally in healthcare the wrong<br>people have got services so we have to<br>have a strong commitment right from the<br>start<br>across our community to focus on those<br>who need it the most<br>and the third commitment from new<br>zealand is to support<br>other parts of the pacific to also at<br>the same time deliver vaccination<br>campaign<br>so that will be alongside new zealand<br>you talked earlier about the importance<br>of communication<br>and uh there is a segment of the<br>population which are skeptical about<br>vaccinations how do you deal with that<br>issue from a communication perspective<br>so this time is our opportunity to reach<br>out to the multiple communities with<br>multiple voices<br>and this is what the new zealand<br>strategy is trying to do is to make a<br>very broad<br>communication strategy at many levels to<br>actually start listening to people and<br>hearing their concerns and feeding that<br>back in<br>to the communication strategy as it goes<br>along because this is going to be an<br>evolving strategy<br>as we become more clear what vaccines<br>available to who and at what time frame<br>if herd immunity is our end goal is<br>there a magic number<br>in terms of the proportion of the<br>population that uh that we have to hit<br>you know when that happens yes it varies<br>um<br>by the organism so for the example of<br>measles mises<br>one one of the most highly infectious<br>viruses we know so to<br>obtain herd immunity you need 1995<br>of your entire population immune now<br>with covert it is not going to be nearly<br>that high because it is not as<br>infectious as measles so<br>the projections are some around 50 to 70<br>percent of your population probably<br>around 50 60 percent maybe being immune<br>now that is doable<br>it depends again on the strategies the<br>public health mitigation strategies<br>alongside the vaccines<br>to ensure that happens and remembering<br>that immunity isn't evenly spread<br>through the community you can still have<br>pockets<br>which is why even when we've got high<br>immunity for measles you can have<br>pockets of outbreak<br>if you've missed a community and you've<br>got lower coverage<br>so we have to think about the spread of<br>immunity within the community as well<br>one thing that i've gotten across<br>everybody today has been that<br>a vaccine will not be a silver bullet<br>yeah is there a silver bullet when it<br>comes to covert 19<br>or is this something that we just have<br>to accept will be a part of humanity now<br>there are strong mitigation approaches<br>there is no<br>single silver bullet but we've learned a<br>great deal and we knew quite a bit to<br>start with<br>that vaccines alongside traditional<br>public health measures<br>alongside therapeutics can all add<br>together<br>to quite a powerful armament and i<br>really want to reflect on an<br>extraordinary story this year from new<br>zealand that we moved into<br>strong mitigation just before the flu<br>season<br>we went into lockdown and then we had<br>strong social distancing and<br>all the important public health messages<br>new zealand did not have<br>a flu winter season this year we had<br>hardly any flu there was a 99<br>reduction in flu virus this year there<br>was a 99<br>reduction in other respiratory viruses<br>particularly<br>virus called rsv respiratory synchro<br>virus it causes wheezy bronchitis in<br>babies<br>our pediatric acute wards have been the<br>quietest through winter that we've ever<br>seen them<br>so what we do know is that vaccines are<br>part<br>of a powerful armament to control<br>respiratory illnesses<br>but they're one piece of it and we<br>mustn't forget that<br>effect of social distancing staying home<br>when you're sick<br>covering your mouth when you cough<br>alongside traditional track and trace<br>with public health so once you find a<br>case<br>protecting all those around the case all<br>of these things work<br>and alongside we will see more<br>therapeutics coming in as well for when<br>the virus does escape and cause harm<br>all of those together don't create a<br>magic bullet but they do create an<br>environment<br>that will be more comfortable than what<br>the currently we're facing in the world<br>right now<br>i suppose every disease that affects<br>humans went through this<br>phase at some point or another in<br>history we just didn't necessarily have<br>the<br>technology or the knowledge to do what<br>we're doing that is correct<br>we are learning a lot and we have<br>learned a lot and i certainly think the<br>lessons from the southern hemisphere<br>about how we can<br>reduce the damage from respiratory<br>illness in general not just covet are<br>very powerful this year<br>well nobody here can predict the future<br>but we're going to ask you to anyway<br>so if we cast our minds forward two<br>years<br>what is the best and most achievable<br>situation that new zealand should be<br>aspiring to we'll begin with you john<br>well i've always been confident<br>given what i know about the technologies<br>and the the speed and the success so far<br>of the<br>the development of vaccines worldwide<br>i'm confident that in two years time new<br>zealand will have sufficient<br>capacity to immunise vaccinate a<br>significant portion of its population<br>where we will begin to consider that<br>it's no longer the major threat that it<br>is today but i also want to<br>um highlight the point that mickey's<br>just made around<br>the other parts to the the puzzle<br>and the armament of therapeutics for<br>instance i mean there are those things<br>that are coming on board as well so that<br>we will have other means to protect<br>people<br>who do get infected from the virus and<br>who can be treated effectively so they<br>don't get horribly sick or potentially<br>die<br>so there's a whole range of things that<br>will be coming on board<br>so in two years time i think we'll be in<br>a very much safer position than we are<br>today and perhaps even sooner helen<br>i i have to go with john here i think<br>based on everything on the table<br>that we have at the moment within two<br>years we<br>we should expect to have a a a new a new<br>normal uh<br>and this will not be the the the hanging<br>over our<br>our um like a dark cloud could be a new<br>normal or a new new normal<br>what's the difference between a new<br>normal and a new union we're getting<br>into semantics<br>but it will be it will be a different<br>world to what we're in now a different<br>world where we have to build back i i<br>hope to see we build back better<br>but these things have shaped um our<br>course of history over thousands of<br>years<br>we came out of the dark ages because of<br>the because of a pandemic<br>um so i'm the optimist in me<br>says um i hope we're building back<br>better and certainly covered should not<br>be a dark cloud over our heads in a<br>couple of years<br>and the heat coming through yes i<br>support the comments um i consider that<br>next year we will have vaccines more<br>than one<br>and that we will be able to vaccinate<br>our frontline providers they're at risk<br>and the most vulnerable populations and<br>new zealand will work very hard to reach<br>out and vaccinate those who need it most<br>by two years i can still see that covert<br>will be entering the new zealand<br>community but we will have a lot more<br>armaments to protect ourselves<br>so we will continue to see covert coming<br>into our community<br>i do not see it it will be gone but we<br>will have better ways to protect<br>ourselves both vaccines<br>therapeutics and the importance much<br>more of traditional public health<br>alongside that<br>i can see in the long term that covert<br>is likely to join<br>our standard respiratory virus<br>repertoire possibly turning into a<br>seasonal<br>disease in the same way that flu is and<br>we will move in the long run towards<br>similar mitigation approaches<br>as to what we have for flu now do you<br>think that people have to tend to<br>perhaps temper their expectations or at<br>least the messaging around a vaccine<br>needs to be more realistic in terms of<br>what it is actually going to achieve and<br>how long that will take<br>i think they do and i think that the the<br>sense<br>from my reading of of the tea leaves is<br>that many people believe that it is the<br>panacea<br>and that it's going to be a one-shot fix<br>that's not going to be the case this is<br>this is we're in this for the long haul<br>um and it's going to take a lot of work<br>and a lot of preparation to deliver this<br>effectively<br>so you know we are not out of the woods<br>yet even if there is a vaccine that<br>appears<br>in six months time what i think we've<br>learned<br>is you know how to deal with a pandemic<br>because this won't be the last and so<br>being better prepared and better<br>understanding what we need to do and how<br>we need to do it<br>and how we can respond i think is what<br>we've most learned from us<br>and i think that's been a global sense<br>around the world is that we've learned a<br>lot from<br>just dealing with a pandemic because we<br>all knew it was going to happen<br>eventually well i would just like to<br>thank<br>our panelists and emil for what has been<br>a very stimulating and informative<br>discussion<br>on a subject which is very prominent in<br>our minds at the moment</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
