take you through their journey of the<br>hawking collections<br>cura everyone good afternoon we're just<br>going to uh share our screen so<br>we've got a powerpoint presentation for<br>you to look at<br>well kia ora um everyone welcome thank<br>you for joining us today it's<br>lovely to to know that you are out here<br>watching our presentation<br>um i'm amanda mills i'm a leo's<br>librarian here and we're going to take<br>you through a powerpoint tour<br>actual tour of the hawken over the next<br>45 minutes<br>so um if you don't know much about the<br>falcon we're going to<br>tell you a wee bit first hawken is<br>open from monday to saturday at 10 a.m<br>to 5 p.m<br>um but our pictures and photographs<br>collections are open<br>by appointment only at the moment<br>so the hawken is uh named after dr tom<br>small and hawkin<br>and he was born in england in 1836 and<br>trained as a medical doctor<br>he immigrated to dunedin in the early<br>1860s and set up a general practice in<br>warrior place<br>right across the road from first church<br>and i'm sure some of you are familiar<br>with that area<br>he also became the coroner in dunedin<br>which involves determining the cause of<br>death of people who die suddenly<br>or in suspicious circumstances dr<br>hawkins began collecting all types of<br>material when he arrived here<br>and he wanted to document the history<br>and development of new zealand<br>he also used this material for his own<br>research and compiled the first major<br>bibliography of new zealand literature<br>he traveled around the country<br>collecting all kinds of printed material<br>as well as art and artifacts he decided<br>to gift his collection to the people of<br>new zealand<br>to be managed by the university of otago<br>so the hawken is both a public library<br>that is open to everyone<br>and also part of the university of otago<br>library system<br>so the hawken first opened in 1910 in a<br>wing of the otago museum and if you go<br>down um<br>the one-way system going north uh you'll<br>still see the hawkenwing on the side of<br>the building<br>once material is accepted into our<br>collections we keep it forever<br>so our need for physical space to keep<br>this material is always increasing as<br>you can imagine<br>the library moved into most of one tower<br>of what was called the hawken building<br>in 1979<br>and that's the building in the middle of<br>the screen<br>and that building is now called the<br>richardson building in 1989 the archives<br>and photograph sections moved into<br>separate buildings on this street<br>uh which is done by the university and<br>in 1998 both sections of the library<br>came together again<br>in our current building on anzac avenue<br>which was formerly a cheese<br>and butter factory it was the otago<br>cooperative dairy factory<br>so we specialize in material from<br>new zealand particularly otago and<br>southland and we also collect material<br>from the<br>pacific antarctica and early australia<br>and we have continued to<br>collect following the original<br>collecting by dr hawkin<br>and this includes any material relating<br>to it<br>to new zealand or by a new zealander and<br>again focusing on otago and southland<br>so the hogan is a research library and<br>collects a wide range of material<br>to a greater depth in a range of subject<br>areas<br>it is reference only so items can only<br>be used within the library and the<br>hopkin is also closed stack<br>so it is only on our library tools that<br>you can see into the stacks where we<br>keep our<br>materials now usually you can search the<br>public catalogs to locate items and<br>request them<br>once you are registered and then staff<br>retrieve them for<br>you to use in our reading rooms<br>you can scan or photograph material but<br>with no flash<br>for your own private research and these<br>of course there are restrictions in<br>place<br>we do ask that you comply with copyright<br>though and we can also supply physical<br>copying but it is<br>so to use the hawkin you must register<br>as a reader<br>if you are a staff member or student<br>from the university of otago or otago<br>polytechnic<br>then you've got an id card which means<br>that you are registered to use our<br>published collections<br>and it's books newspapers and magazines<br>maps and audio visual material<br>you can do this by logging on to the<br>university of otago<br>um library catalog it's called library<br>certificate<br>with your institution's username and<br>password<br>now if you use wish to use our<br>unpublished collections with the<br>archives and manuscripts<br>photographs pictures and ephemera and<br>you need to research that<br>sorry then you need to register to use<br>hakana which is our unpublished<br>collections database<br>any member of the public can register to<br>use<br>any of the collections and desk staff<br>can provide you with registration form<br>to fill out<br>uh but we do need to cite some photo id<br>so if you could just please put<br>in a driver's license passport um or<br>something that has your photograph on it<br>so because we hold unique heritage<br>material and we wish to<br>keep it for as long as possible um we do<br>ask that people please place any bags<br>and laptop sleeves and<br>lockers um each locker can be locked<br>with a key and you deposit that while<br>you're in the library<br>so everything is safe you are able<br>to bring in items like laptops and<br>writing material<br>but we do ask that pencils are used in<br>the reading room only and we do provide<br>these as well<br>also if you have one we we suggest you<br>bring in your university with polytech<br>id cards<br>and of course your hawken card um we<br>can't<br>eat and or eat or drink in the reading<br>room but you are most welcome to make<br>use of our<br>lunchroom and the foyer there is a<br>fridge and an oven in a microwave<br>oven for use and there's tea coffee and<br>milo and of course water available as<br>well<br>now these supplies are paid for through<br>donation and there is a donation box<br>on the wall in the tea room<br>so just a wee overview of the published<br>collections and the unpublished material<br>that we have<br>so in our published collections there<br>are a wide range of books both fiction<br>and non-fiction<br>and here you can see um some of our<br>items for example a first edition<br>of the edmonds cookbook we also hold a<br>wide variety of past and current<br>newspapers<br>from the very first newspaper published<br>in dunedin the otago news<br>in 1848 through two newspapers published<br>in the pacific islands<br>we only hold the major daily newspapers<br>for auckland and wellington and the<br>north island<br>but we do hold a wide range of new<br>newspapers published in<br>south island for smaller towns and<br>cities as well as the bigger bigger<br>centres<br>also hold a large number of new zealand<br>pacific and antarctic related<br>magazines and new cities these range<br>from mainstream<br>magazines like the new zealand women's<br>day to academic journals such as pacific<br>fines<br>we have a very large map collection that<br>includes<br>things like early discovery maps through<br>to modern tourist maps<br>the collection includes a wide range of<br>map types such as charts that show how<br>deep the harbors are<br>atlas's topographical maps that show<br>features of the landscape<br>and cadastral maps such as the ones seen<br>here for waverly<br>which is a suburb in dunedin<br>these show how the land has been split<br>into sections and blocks<br>ownership and our collection also<br>include the series of aerial photographs<br>of dunedin<br>from the late 1940s um<br>i'm always proud of these collections<br>because these other ones that i develop<br>and take care of so we collect all<br>formats<br>of recorded music and sound recordings<br>by new zealand artists or produced in<br>new zealand<br>these include over 19 000 recordings<br>on record and it includes lps 45s<br>and 78 rpm discs uh there's also<br>cassette tapes and compact discs um we<br>even have a cylinder<br>or two alongside these collections we<br>hold over three and a half thousand<br>pieces of sheet music<br>and the oldest on the right is the<br>whalers of the dhc<br>by the huhu and george from around 1857.<br>uh we're also starting to collect<br>digital downloads but these are<br>currently not available to listen to<br>um as yet um our music collections<br>represent all genres<br>from classical music and opera to punk<br>country and western<br>rock and popular music our collection is<br>particularly strong in the music<br>especially that of the dunedin sound<br>our sound recordings um also include new<br>zealand myths and stories in<br>both english and today as well as<br>recordings of new zealand literature and<br>sports commentary<br>and um<br>getting a bit ahead of ourselves here um<br>i also collect the audio visual<br>materials so<br>um our audio visual collections include<br>a wide range of formats on vhs video and<br>dvd<br>as well as blu-ray disc a range of<br>genres are also covered from<br>documentaries such as ymi which is a<br>dunedin study<br>uh feature films for example scarfies<br>from 1996 which is a film about otago<br>university<br>students and their antics um and moana<br>a children's film picturing um which i<br>think is a polynesian story<br>um as well as<br>myths and the film uh includes new<br>zealand actors as well<br>and we also have the english and today<br>version of that film<br>uh we also collect television series so<br>um we you might be familiar with<br>westside<br>which is a historical drama and<br>outrageous fortune<br>so all material must be played on the<br>equipment and our audio vigil area<br>and these can be set up so that four<br>people at once can view will listen at<br>any one time<br>we do ask if you did come in and wanted<br>to watch something on video or listen to<br>something on cassette<br>that you order it 24 hours before you<br>come in<br>just because of the way it's stored it<br>okay so it's catherine now when i look<br>after the ephemera collection<br>ephemera is a greek word that means<br>something that lasts for a day so<br>in in terms of what we hold here it is<br>the type of material that most people<br>would use and then dispose of but we<br>want to collect that kind of material<br>because it's direct evidence of what our<br>society was like at a particular time<br>so it tells you about the types of<br>technology that we had available<br>fashions in clothing design<br>and it's just actually some just<br>and not a lot of other libraries<br>collected and so that's why it is<br>important to collect and on the screen<br>there you can see examples of the types<br>of flyers we have<br>so as you probably are well aware it's<br>election time and we've been collecting<br>election material for the whole country<br>since 1966.<br>we also have a whole range of programs<br>it does include<br>major sporting events but also<br>all kinds of music and theater programs<br>we do just basically collect these for<br>otago<br>and a little bit of southland but some<br>things we do collect nationally so<br>the election ephemera as well as tourism<br>ephemera we do collect for the whole<br>country<br>um we also and collection includes<br>uh packaging for local firms so here you<br>can see<br>a german sausages label for a local<br>company irvine and<br>stevenson they used to be located in<br>dunedin and they made<br>jam as well as obviously tinned meats<br>and what's interesting<br>is this is probably pre world war one<br>because anything that had the name<br>german and it would have changed<br>uh to belgium because of the negative<br>connotations with the war<br>on the left here a lot of you will be<br>familiar with this so these are golden<br>kiwi tickets what we used to have pre<br>lotto and we get groups of high school<br>students coming in and they're always<br>interested to see that the first prize<br>back then was uh twenty four thousand<br>dollars<br>which wouldn't even get you a deposit on<br>a house these days but back then they<br>probably paid for a house and a whole<br>lot<br>more and on the far right here we've got<br>um<br>an nac airline ticket and again<br>it shows you the changes in our society<br>because these days you can turn up you<br>don't even have to have a physical<br>ticket you can just scan<br>something qr code from your phone you<br>don't have to have that physical ticket<br>so<br>again evidence of how society changes<br>over time<br>and uh ephemera collection also includes<br>posters and there's over 23 000 posters<br>at the hocken<br>um these range and and subject<br>uh we've got a very strong collection of<br>um health and safety posters and here<br>you can see<br>some quite important messages that are<br>still um of concern<br>today and in the middle there another<br>election poster this one's from the<br>1970s it's for the labor party but you<br>can see that they're trying to heart<br>back to the times when woman first got<br>the vote<br>and on the right here um this is a this<br>is not a poster but it's<br>more like a menu of um<br>services available at hindi's toilet<br>rooms and toilet room was actually<br>an old name for ladies hairdressers so<br>you can see<br>the types of servers that were available<br>and the prices they<br>charged the problem with a lot of<br>ephemera is it doesn't have dates but<br>through research with old telephone<br>books that we have in the library<br>and actually just working out that<br>marcel waving was a<br>form of curling you'll hear that was<br>very popular in the 1920s and 30s<br>this is probably the date of this actual<br>item here<br>so we have a very very large archives<br>and manuscripts collection at<br>the library archives are the records of<br>an organization and our<br>records include a whole lot of<br>organizations like<br>local churches we have we're the<br>official repository for the anglican<br>churches in otago<br>we also include a whole lot of local<br>schools and businesses and of course the<br>university college of education<br>a whole lot of sporting and community<br>organizations<br>places like the otago rugby football<br>union plunkett society started in<br>dunedin so we've got all your records<br>there<br>manuscripts are the personal papers of<br>individuals so it can include things<br>like diaries and on the<br>top right of the screen here you can see<br>a journal by william<br>fox who was an early surveyor he<br>traveled out to new zealand in the 1840s<br>and his<br>uh journal of his voyage out to new<br>zealand and<br>some fabulous little sketches including<br>the one on the screen which shows a dog<br>and we also have the papers of later<br>lady anna stout she was married to<br>robert stout who was a prominent dunedin<br>lawyer<br>and then became the premier of new<br>zealand<br>she was an early suffragist and<br>um was involved in the british<br>suffragist movement and she collected<br>suffragette badges from all around the<br>world so there<br>also the type of material we have in the<br>library<br>so there are over a million photographs<br>in the archives collection because if<br>people donate us their photographs along<br>with their letters and diaries and<br>things we can keep them together in the<br>archives collection<br>but we've also got over a million<br>photographs separately in our<br>photographs collection<br>and again these cover all kinds of<br>topics<br>and people<br>and all kinds of um subjects and on the<br>and they include uh photographs from<br>amateur photo photographers as well as<br>um professional photographer studios so<br>on the top left there you can see a<br>portrait of jonah mcfarland by morris<br>couture<br>you may remember sharon mcfarlane she<br>was a panelist on<br>the tv show in the 1970s beauty and<br>beast and she was also<br>quite a well-known artist and on the top<br>right is a photograph<br>of the octagon in the 1870s with a big<br>monument here that's not there anymore<br>below there is a photograph from the<br>1960s of the balaclava midgets marching<br>team<br>which is in color so people can see<br>the lurid colors that were used for<br>fashion in the 1960s<br>and on the left there dunedin airport<br>with an nac<br>airplane so that ticket that we saw<br>previously<br>would have been what you used to board<br>the plane<br>we also have a very large pictures<br>collection so over 17 000 works of art<br>and if you<br>compare that for example to the holdings<br>of the needham public art gallery<br>they've got 13 000 so it is a<br>significant<br>collection and it includes very early<br>works of art so on the bottom we have a<br>work<br>by uh jc hoyt of showing the pink and<br>white terraces which<br>disappeared in the tarawera eruption so<br>dr hawkins was collecting<br>works of art like this because they<br>showed what the country looked like and<br>when he first<br>came to new zealand photography was just<br>being started so this was a way of<br>documenting what what our country looked<br>like and the changes and he also<br>collected portraits of um people who<br>were prominent in history<br>but over time our focus of collecting<br>has changed so we are documenting the<br>history and development of new zealand<br>art itself<br>so um we have a we are not only<br>collecting<br>um historic artists but current artists<br>as well so on the top left there is a<br>work by<br>doris lusk which shows tobacco fields at<br>nelson and on the right is a work by wh<br>allen which shows a baby called david<br>who was seven months old in september<br>1973.<br>so the hawken has its own website it's<br>actually when within the main university<br>of otago library<br>website but if you just typed in the<br>word hockin into google it will bring up<br>our website and you can see<br>in this blue banner on the left there's<br>a whole lot of links where you can find<br>further information as well as staff<br>contacts if you wanted to email us in<br>particular<br>or find other curators to if you've got<br>a specific inquiry maybe that relates to<br>the mac collection it would make more<br>sense to<br>contact karen or our librarian and in<br>this middle there there's also some<br>links here that you can take as well as<br>links to our social media accounts which<br>we'll talk about<br>later so one of the links on the blue<br>banner is to our research guides we've<br>got<br>over 40 of these these are all free and<br>available to download from our web page<br>we do update these every year and but if<br>you are able to come into the library<br>then you can pick up paper copies and<br>again they're free<br>so we do have a set of genealogical<br>sources guides or if you're<br>interested in genealogical research and<br>you wanted to know about specific<br>resources that are held at the hawkins<br>that they describe what we have<br>and then our main reference guides are<br>split up into sort of subject areas so<br>there are ones covering all the major<br>awards like<br>world war one south african war world<br>war ii<br>we have a lot of people coming to do<br>research on houses<br>and buildings so there's a guide<br>relating to that if you're interested in<br>agriculture<br>tactics science health sciences<br>law these guides relating to those and<br>on the right there we also have<br>a series of maori research guides so<br>there's<br>one specifically on kaita whose<br>resources but also how to do<br>papa research now<br>both our catalogues are available online<br>so you are<br>able to search them from anywhere<br>without having to be uh<br>registered as a library user but if you<br>do ever want to come in and use<br>the collections as i mentioned before<br>you do have to register as a reader<br>so we are gradually digitizing material<br>and making it sometimes available<br>through these catalogs<br>this particular catalog here is what you<br>would use to search for our published<br>collection so our books<br>newspapers magazines maps and audio<br>visual material<br>but you do have to be aware that it also<br>includes the holdings of the main<br>university library system but when you<br>find something you just need to check<br>that it's got a hawk and holding to be<br>oh yeah hakuna is the name of our other<br>catalogue<br>so that's where you look for any other<br>kind of material so that's pictures<br>photographs archives and manuscripts and<br>we've just started adding ephemera so<br>there's not a lot on there at the moment<br>ephemera wise so if you can't find<br>anything on our catalogs it does always<br>pay to ask staff because not everything<br>is actually listed on the catalogues<br>or you it may be the way that you're<br>searching so<br>staff are always willing to help you<br>find material yourself<br>we also have a separate website called<br>hawk and snapshop where we have made<br>available<br>digitized photographs is about thirty<br>thousand photographs so as we<br>i said earlier there's two million<br>photographs in the library altogether<br>so this is a very small portion and we<br>are not adding to this<br>particular website but there are images<br>you can search<br>you can search under a particular term<br>or you can browse using<br>um the subjects on the on the right on<br>the screen<br>and you are able to download low-risk<br>images there<br>and we have another website called our<br>heritage where you are able to find<br>some digitized paintings a few pieces of<br>ephemera<br>sheet music from world war one as well<br>and as i said before we do have a social<br>media presence<br>so we do have our own facebook page<br>twitter account a hocken blog<br>page and a youtube channel so if any of<br>you<br>are exploring the web then please feel<br>free to log on to any of those and<br>locate<br>our materials okay so what we're going<br>to do now is we've selected a few items<br>that you might<br>um find of interest and so we're just<br>going to run through those<br>so as this is an alumni event we<br>thought that you would be interested in<br>some things relating to the university<br>from<br>days gone by and we do have a fantastic<br>collection of<br>photographs that are available to view<br>through our<br>catalogue that were taken in 1949<br>by a photographer in the prime<br>minister's department so as you can see<br>they're very good quality photographs<br>and this one shows a chat between<br>lectures<br>at the university of otago quadrangle<br>and<br>obviously students back then were a lot<br>better dressed than they are now<br>and they've even got nice little leather<br>briefcases too<br>and another photograph in that series<br>shows the interior of saint margaret's<br>college common room obviously a women's<br>college and<br>again another fascinating glimpse into<br>the life of students back in 1949<br>so there's a wide range of university of<br>otago related<br>material in the collections and that<br>includes periodicals and<br>on the right you'll see the otago<br>university capping book<br>so capping is a huge part of university<br>culture and we've documented it in<br>different collections<br>um here you see a recording on the left<br>of<br>the 1960 captain concert and as i said<br>the 1948 captain book<br>we also have photographs publications<br>archives and other documents<br>and some other av recordings from the<br>1980s of<br>so on the left here you can see an<br>a it's not really a poster it's kind of<br>a card that was used to promote<br>a 1958 production by the otago<br>university dramatic society<br>and this scan here doesn't really show<br>it in its full glory because<br>the um painting the coloured lettering<br>is actually kind of<br>a lot brighter and almost floral in<br>appearance<br>and it's just an example of the type of<br>material we have relating to a whole lot<br>of clubs and societies of the university<br>and on the right here you can see<br>a photograph of the from the university<br>cricket club senior 11 in 1968 and 69<br>and this material is in our archives<br>collection so again we have<br>records for a whole lot of different<br>clubs but we also have<br>so if any of you have your own records<br>that you'd like to donate to the library<br>would be most interested in that kind of<br>material so just<br>feel free to contact us about it<br>and then in our art collection we also<br>have some beautiful drawings<br>architectural drawings um this is one by<br>edmund escombe who was an<br>architect and he obviously designed this<br>archway<br>building which features ellen hall on<br>the<br>on the right there and behind it was<br>marama hall<br>and obviously it's not a literal<br>depiction there because as you may all<br>remember this building's actually on a<br>slope<br>so um on our youtube channel uh there's<br>about 50 short videos and you can find<br>it on youtube<br>um if you go to the website and just<br>type in hocking collections in this<br>box and it will bring up that channel so<br>this<br>film um is vj day celebrations in<br>dunedin on the 15th of august 1945<br>marking the end of world war ii and the<br>film is from the collection of dunedin<br>amateur filmmaker<br>william davidson um who passed away in<br>1979<br>um and we all we have to thank um morris<br>hayward for digitising this film and<br>um morris cine club in dunedin and he<br>does amazing stuff digitizing local film<br>um for us and for other institutions<br>well<br>and this is footage shot around<br>queenstown and lake wakatipu in 1951 or<br>1952<br>uh so the film shows the steam as the<br>ben<br>lomond and the unslow also queenstown<br>gardens uh<br>streets and buildings bowling and views<br>from them are from a motorboat<br>um icard's hotel and the colorado for<br>spam<br>and it's digitized from eight millimeter<br>film and the george thorne collection<br>and again thank you to morris hayward<br>who did such a wonderful job of<br>digitising so<br>in the ephemera collection we've got all<br>kinds of advertising for local<br>firms and companies and on the left here<br>you can see<br>um a fabulous advertisement for<br>stockings<br>and again no date possibly 1950s i would<br>say from the<br>dress on that she's wearing um for like<br>it was a local department store arthur<br>barnett some of you may recall that<br>which it's now being changed to h smith<br>and again about to change again because<br>that firm<br>has is closing the negan store and on<br>the right there we've got a fabulous<br>advertisement<br>for 1960 triumph herald<br>and this is from a brochure and someone<br>has helpfully hand written the price<br>at that time of 895<br>pounds a bargain<br>and then this is a great sheet of um<br>little<br>um colored advertising cards<br>for that was part of a competition<br>called the whopper swapper so<br>each of these sheets was delivered to<br>households in dunedin<br>and the aim was that people would cut up<br>each square they would<br>decide they would only collect one or<br>two of them and then<br>you would swap them with other people<br>who are obviously collecting other ones<br>and then<br>you would submit how many um cards you<br>had<br>collected to the competition runners and<br>you can see there was quite a great<br>price<br>of um 150 pounds<br>for the open section and for children<br>it was a little surprise of 25 pounds<br>but what's great for<br>for researchers today is that some of<br>these firms<br>are still going but it also shows<br>um fashions and actually also the<br>longevity of bread so you've got<br>tiger tea there and you can see it's a<br>packet of tea so<br>it shows to people today that you made<br>tea in a teapot there's not tea bags<br>and it's also showing you all kinds of<br>other<br>um great things like<br>rolo caramel chocolates there's<br>lawrence's bread there's<br>cars and also how um<br>the use of language has changed because<br>there's the use of<br>gay detergent which wouldn't get these<br>days<br>also in the ephemera collection we've<br>got a fantastic collection of nursing<br>patterns probably one of the best<br>collections within a new zealand<br>institution we've got over 3000 of those<br>and they date from the 1940s onwards<br>um from the 1950s and 60s you start to<br>see<br>local photographers and models being<br>used and<br>obviously taken in local locations so<br>this<br>um cardigan with a with a great<br>useful pocket which can fit two fingers<br>on this lady<br>um has actually been photographed in<br>front of<br>the parliament buildings in wellington<br>and on the right here we've got um a<br>a pattern featuring a local uh<br>miss otago contestant in 1960 she was<br>one of the semi-finalists lynn young<br>and this was atom was photographed<br>in the grounds of glen phallic and with<br>a rather splendid<br>peacock and the other thing that's<br>interesting to note is that they<br>produced<br>patterns for what they called oversized<br>people which<br>who had a 40 inch or 44 inch bus<br>and sadly what they used to do is for<br>the<br>oversized patterns they usually use<br>older models so again<br>we can see fashions and trends in<br>society<br>at that time using resources like this<br>so we've got um some very interesting<br>map formats in hawkins collections<br>including this 256<br>piece jigsaw map and it was created in<br>the early 1940s<br>the map is called a puzzle for europe<br>and the pieces of each european country<br>that were invaded by germany and<br>germantu are in the shape of a swastika<br>the jigsaw is accompanied also by a map<br>of europe<br>we have this item um as many<br>entertainment who manufactured the<br>jigsaw<br>were were based locally and we have two<br>copies the first donated<br>by mr ew difference in 1989 was missing<br>two pieces but a second copy<br>was found at the regent everything sale<br>a few years ago<br>fully intact so we picked up another<br>copy to have a fully<br>so in our maps collection we've got all<br>different kinds of maps and includes<br>these great farm location maps so these<br>were produced in the 1960s<br>right through to the 90s and they were<br>often done as fundraising projects for<br>organizations like the jc's and here you<br>can see one that's covering south otago<br>this one was published in 1979<br>and what's great for people maybe doing<br>their family history<br>is it shows where a particular person's<br>farm was located in the area so<br>so something that might have been used<br>for the local farmers is now<br>of use for genealogical research today<br>um as i said before we've got millions<br>of photographs in our collection and<br>they are great for<br>showing what they need and used to look<br>like this is a photograph<br>from 1967 showing the lower optican<br>where there was the open hotel was<br>building still stands and now it's<br>a bar and cafe called bystanders<br>and i've also just noticed before in the<br>top<br>um of the photograph you can see the<br>wires for the trolley buses that were<br>still working there<br>and on the left there you can see a firm<br>called matheson a robert so they were a<br>plant and nursery<br>um so up in the lower octagon and our<br>ephemera eclipse<br>includes some fabulous posters for that<br>particular firm<br>here you can see a photograph of dunedin<br>railway station in the 1930s<br>this material was gifted to the waialua<br>museum and then transferred to the<br>hawken<br>um again it shows changes and obviously<br>not for the building<br>because that's still pretty much the<br>same but it shows how the foreground has<br>changed this is all now all planted out<br>in a<br>rather lovely little garden but it's<br>also great to see<br>in the back the foreground of the<br>station um<br>cars of that time<br>and then we've got this great photograph<br>from the 1955-61<br>it was taken by a photographer lord<br>chance showing<br>what agricultural work was being done<br>and then this is a fabulous piece of<br>work<br>from the same area so this was a<br>painting by<br>nicholas chevalier so he came<br>over to new zealand in the 1860s he was<br>commissioned by the otago provincial<br>government<br>and he was paid 200 pounds to travel<br>around otago and paint<br>beautiful scenery to try and attract<br>settlers over here<br>um he also did similar kind of work for<br>the canterbury provincial<br>council so he went around the mountain<br>region visiting all the major lakes<br>and this is one of his fabulous pieces<br>of work<br>and then we also have this great scene<br>by<br>um a local artist ralph he was<br>part of the miller family who ran miller<br>studios and this<br>work is showing a dunedin scene from<br>circa 1949<br>um and he was mostly self-taught artists<br>but he did have some lessons from<br>dunedin artists ah<br>keith and kathleen salmond and during<br>the war he was a member of the army band<br>and was posted to fiji in new caledonia<br>and we do<br>and there are a lot of works not<br>necessarily in our library but that<br>he created showing army life at that<br>time<br>but obviously back in dunedin he tried<br>to show what needham was like back then<br>and then we also have some fabulous sort<br>of art in our posters collection<br>so the railway studio was an artist<br>studio that was<br>run by the railways from 1920 to 1987<br>and obviously they did a lot of work<br>promoting railways and tourist<br>destinations but they also did work for<br>other government departments<br>so here you can see a transport<br>department poster this is actually one<br>of my favorite posters in the collection<br>um getting people to slow down and<br>winter traffic with the rain<br>and on the right here um a poster trying<br>to<br>stop people from sitting on the ground<br>because it's disgusting and dangerous<br>and done for the department of health so<br>there are this is one of<br>many um health and great health and<br>safety posters that we have that were<br>done by<br>the studio so in our sheet music<br>collection we have very very early<br>pieces of new zealand cheap music<br>and this is the very first edition of<br>defeating new zealand and this is the<br>english edition from around 1976<br>the first new zealand edition came about<br>a couple of years later<br>and it came about due to discontent<br>between<br>the authors um i think it's thomas<br>bracken on the cover of this one<br>but don woods was not particularly<br>impressed that he was left off the first<br>edition<br>so um a second edition was printed with<br>them both<br>offer both on cover and<br>maori text of new zealand was<br>available in the second edition as well<br>there are only five copies<br>left in existence of the first english<br>ambition um it's<br>very very rare um and the hawken is<br>really lucky to have<br>two um and they were donated to us by<br>the sisters at<br>that's dominic's priory in dunedin and<br>um dunedin's possibly the hop and sorry<br>it's possibly the only collection for<br>whole copies of this first edition that<br>i'm aware of<br>um i'm i have not heard of any other<br>institution<br>holding uh these copies but um they<br>always change<br>um we also have a lot a number of<br>amazing periodicals um in hawken and one<br>of my favorites is playdate<br>so it was one of the film music and<br>popular culture magazines<br>from the 1960s to the early 1970s and<br>many famous names and faces of the time<br>were featured in the magazine<br>and it did often focus on local new<br>zealand musicians<br>and actors and popular culture figures<br>we've also been extremely lucky to<br>acquire collections of local firms<br>so when cadburys closed a few years ago<br>the hawken was fortunate to acquire<br>a number of amazing things from them<br>including posters chocolate boxes<br>and packaging and as well as the company<br>records<br>now this short reel of cadbury<br>advertisements from the late 1960s or<br>early 1970s<br>as part of the company records and would<br>have likely been used on<br>either television advertising or in<br>advertisements at the movies<br>it was it was recorded in great britain<br>uh but used to advertise products and<br>countries and it can be chocolate<br>so we're just going to play you a mutual<br>couple of clips so<br>this man is here to sing the praises of<br>which is delicious fudge just like mum<br>used to make only cadburys<br>have covered it with creamy milk<br>chocolate<br>cadbury<br>so continuing on with the music theme we<br>have a huge collection of maori and<br>pacific music at the hawken<br>and it's got a strong presence in our av<br>collections and recordings reflect both<br>traditional and popular music styles<br>this will bill ralph graham recording on<br>the left south sea rhythm<br>thanks to 1956 and is considered new<br>zealand's first<br>pop album well the album on the right uh<br>maori song of new zealand was issued<br>on focus records and that's part of<br>smithsonian label<br>in 1952 and also affected traditional<br>songs and song styles<br>and um if you've got um if you can see<br>right up in the corner um you might have<br>seen the owner's name<br>yes the original owner was professor<br>hargreaves who was a geography professor<br>and he lived in new york for a time and<br>he was a major supporter of<br>hawkins collections some of these may be<br>very familiar to you<br>these are broadcast to school teachers<br>and people's music books from the 1960s<br>now the books included notated melodies<br>and words so students could play or sing<br>along with the<br>cast but some of you may have had some<br>of those broadcasts<br>um in your um in your school days uh the<br>teachers books had full of piano or<br>tasks so they could um give full<br>instrumentation for any performance<br>and some of the books like these ones<br>were really beautifully illustrated<br>and these illustrations are by the<br>artist evelyn closten<br>we don't just collect music as i said<br>earlier we collect all sorts of sound<br>recordings<br>including children's stories and fairy<br>tales myths literature including poetry<br>and prose writing interviews and<br>broadcasts<br>and we will have also have a small<br>collection of sports broadcasts<br>and racing calls and this is a favorite<br>this is cinderella<br>published by the children's record build<br>of new zealand in the late 60s<br>and dunedin music collections are of<br>course of significant importance to us<br>so um on the left you've got um the mc6<br>and joe brown he was a figure who he ran<br>dances<br>in denim during the um early to mid<br>1960s<br>and the mc6 were one of his stunts and<br>two played at these<br>um dances this 45 rpm<br>is a recording from uh from them at a<br>time<br>um in the center you have luther now<br>luther were one of the major bands from<br>dunedin<br>in the early 1970s and they were a sort<br>of super group that formed from three<br>bands<br>that were finalists in the 1960 now and<br>south island battle of bands<br>and the second album pictured here is uh<br>probably the most popular recording<br>and on the end um on the right we have<br>opposed to advertising the<br>chillz doldrums single the chills are<br>still one of the most popular bands from<br>the 1980s didn't even sound<br>seen and are still performing and<br>recording today<br>and our collections of the material are<br>wide and include posters<br>and ephemera as well as recordings and<br>photographs<br>and just continue on on with dunedin<br>music um<br>local 1960s band tightened in the middle<br>with the<br>lovely matching suits of dunedin's top<br>end in the 1960s and came<br>second in the 1968 new zealand battle of<br>the bands<br>they often played with the avengers on<br>the right um when that band were touring<br>and the band on the left the caitlyn's<br>river boys were big names in south otago<br>and they uh performed very um on a very<br>early uh tv<br>show and it was a it was a big thing<br>apparently half of oawaka were<br>in front of the television that night<br>watching them<br>all the titans and the viewers played<br>pop rock and the style of the groups of<br>the day the catlins river boys<br>played country music some christian<br>songs included and<br>it's noted that these sound at times is<br>similar to new zealand's<br>own peter poser um now the titans didn't<br>ever release anything but we<br>have a collection of their material and<br>included a couple of tracks so<br>um we have a cover of this um<br>we have them um doing uh ben morrison<br>gloria<br>and we're just gonna snip it over to<br>is<br>okay so going back to our archives<br>collection it does include a<br>whole range of um papers and<br>this is a collection of papers relating<br>to charles mackie who<br>served during the war world war one<br>and he was the um in command of the<br>field ambulance and medical corps<br>in egypt gallipoli and the western front<br>and his papers include<br>these photograph albums as well as<br>a notes book there and diaries and he<br>actually advanced to the top medical<br>post in the new zealand<br>expeditionary force before he finished<br>there<br>and we also apparently got one of the<br>best collections of sporting archives in<br>the collection and it does include this<br>um great scrapbook which or album which<br>includes newspaper clippings as well as<br>photographs and ephemera from a<br>tour by a maori rugby team in 1926 and<br>27 and they traveled overseas and in<br>the top left corner there you can see<br>hey so um if you are in town um<br>in dunedin and you would like to see<br>more public tours<br>are available on thursday mornings

our<br>phone number as well so we'll just leave<br>that let's<br>slide up for a couple of seconds and<br>public tours are available all year<br>round for individuals or groups of less<br>than 10.<br>and um we love donations and if you can<br>help us with any of our collections we<br>are always eternally grateful<br>uh we are always keen to augment our<br>collections of new zealand and public<br>and pacific related<br>and published and unpublished material<br>and any donations are very gratefully<br>accepted<br>and please contact us for further<br>information it is a guide on giving<br>archives and manuscripts which is<br>thank you amanda and catherine what a<br>fabulous tour through the hocken and i'm<br>sure that<br>uh you could have gone on for so much<br>longer i know you had me bopping in my<br>seat to some of the music<br>and it was wonderful to point to the<br>screen and um<br>take away trip down memory lane and i'm<br>sure many of our other<br>participants felt the same we have a<br>couple of questions that have come in<br>that i'd like you to see if you could<br>answer<br>so one question um is in the ephemera<br>collections have you noticed any trends<br>in the materials<br>that have repeated themselves in<br>um yes so i mean there is obviously<br>still<br>printed ephemera so that's continued<br>there is a trend for more things to<br>become digital as well<br>so obviously lockdown was a big<br>impact on businesses so you may have<br>noticed during that time that new world<br>decided to stop<br>creating their own mailers so they only<br>do them<br>online now so<br>you do get things disappearing because<br>of different technology but obviously<br>people still produce physical items<br>because not everyone has access to the<br>internet<br>and you know you can<br>include different things in physical<br>items but<br>but at the same time things don't still<br>um still<br>have to be represented so we've got a<br>great collection<br>of um the types of sheets that are<br>produced<br>in funerals for funerals or for people<br>that died and so<br>you can see that sort of coming into<br>being in the<br>50s 60s in the very plain and then over<br>time you can see with<br>um computer technology people start<br>personalizing things a lot more so that<br>that something that's still there<br>because<br>people well obviously covert has changed<br>that as well that not everyone's able to<br>attend<br>um a funeral in person but for those<br>that are they are still given a sheet<br>so that's something that's still there<br>but you can see over time how that has<br>changed<br>thank you and the other question that<br>we've got from the same um<br>same participant stephanie um she also<br>asks<br>do you both have a favorite item in the<br>collection which i'm sure is a difficult<br>question to<br>answer i know you mentioned one of the<br>um traffic posters<br>um the winter driving one being one of<br>your favorites but is there anything<br>else that you always<br>um you're right it is one of the hardest<br>questions um<br>i i can't pick a favorite in the music<br>collection i love it all<br>um yeah i just can't pick a favorite but<br>um things that do stand out uh say<br>things that um<br>i remember from uh i remember loving for<br>a long time and<br>maybe i haven't seen for a while and<br>it's it's all wonderful but<br>actually some of my favorite other<br>things um<br>in the ephemera collection uh there's<br>some amazing posters which are my<br>favorites um and catherine got a toy<br>world<br>catalog from the 1980s a couple of years<br>ago<br>and it was one i remembered very fondly<br>from when i was a child in the 1980s<br>and as soon as i saw that poor world<br>catalog i was back to being a kid i was<br>back to being eight or ten years old<br>and um yeah that's one of my favorite<br>things<br>and i think that's one of the great<br>things about having physical items like<br>things can be digitized and you can see<br>them online but nothing<br>replaces being able to see the physical<br>item and to be able to touch it because<br>that that brings it that makes it more<br>real and<br>and so like for example the golden kiwi<br>tickets that i showed before you can<br>read about them in a book but when you<br>actually<br>see them in person that kind of tactile<br>experience relays a whole lot of things<br>that you don't always<br>pick up on like it shows you like the<br>feel of the paper you can see that it's<br>been pouring off a pad and all that kind<br>of thing so nothing replaces seeing the<br>physical items<br>and again like amanda it's really hard<br>to pick something<br>um and say that's my favorite i have<br>different things i like to show people<br>on toys so for example<br>and we got a great set of um<br>posters from cadburys and they included<br>some fabulous cookie beer posters from<br>the 1970s which again<br>featured the fluoro paint so they're a<br>great thing for me because<br>like i was a member of the cookie beer<br>club in the 70s so these things like<br>that but also<br>um the great packaging that we have<br>we've got a fabulous we've got lots of<br>fabulous<br>chocolate boxes and other kinds of<br>packaging<br>and even things like junk mail and you<br>might think why do you keep<br>junk mail well if you think about it it<br>tells you at a particular time what kind<br>of products we were selling<br>how we sold them the technology that<br>made them so<br>showing people that because they you<br>know it shows that<br>even the most lowly kind of thing that's<br>in our society today will have<br>significant research value<br>years from now so that's one of the<br>great things about a collection like<br>mine i would have to say the whole<br>collection is my favorite<br>and i think from both your answers you<br>have inspired many of our participants<br>to want to come and actually have a look<br>those things in reality um i have<br>another question here<br>things in in many in different um<br>formats what<br>particular things do you have to take<br>sorry didn't quite catch that question<br>can you just repeat it<br>sorry what what sorts of special<br>techniques or things do you have to do<br>to keep the collections<br>safe so in terms of preserving paper<br>quality or preserving<br>um artworks i'm sure there's a lot of<br>special things that you need to be aware<br>of<br>yeah so um obviously having it<br>in our stacks is one of the major things<br>so<br>um our stacks of climate control so<br>they're kept at about 18 degrees and a<br>relative humidity of 50<br>so obviously most of our works are uh<br>made from printed paper so that's kind<br>of the optimal conditions for<br>paper so it's not too ant where mold<br>would grow it's not too dry where paper<br>would become brittle<br>and also we um for<br>for a published material and things like<br>that we have special packaging so<br>it's acid free so again it's not going<br>to help things deteriorate<br>and we try and and get things measured<br>up<br>especially so that the packaging fits<br>snugly<br>and we'll wrap things in acid-free paper<br>we also<br>um again it depends where it's come from<br>because sometimes<br>people might have kept things like in a<br>damp basement where it's already moldy<br>so<br>sometimes that kind of it has to be<br>treated before we would put it in our<br>stacks next to other material<br>and we don't have a conservator on site<br>but we can call on<br>a local conservator to help us do that<br>kind of<br>preservation and we have special<br>cabinets<br>and folders and boxes um<br>to keep material in so we're always<br>aiming to<br>um improve the conditions that um<br>we collect material and um you know<br>music's a little different uh a lot of<br>music formats<br>for example records are very stable um<br>the only thing you have to be careful<br>about<br>especially with the older ones is not to<br>drop them because<br>especially with 78s they will shatter um<br>that's it's just the nature of the way<br>they made but<br>lps and 45s if you drop them most of the<br>time<br>they they're okay um it's more put if<br>you put them in sunlight or any warm<br>um environment they could sort of warp<br>or melt um<br>the best the biggest thing for things<br>like bhs tapes and cassette cases<br>keeping them in cooler temperatures<br>so they are in their own uh room along<br>with um<br>uh glass plate negatives and um some<br>film that we have<br>so they're in a 12 degree vault um so<br>they kept<br>cooler and that's why if people want to<br>listen to<br>cassette tapes or watch vhs tapes they<br>have to give us 24 hours<br>24 hours grace to be able to get the<br>item out<br>and acclimatize it because if you put a<br>cold tape<br>into a room temperature machine um<br>something's either going to go wrong<br>with the item or the machine<br>and we can't have either of that<br>happening um<br>yeah so it really does come down to how<br>you keep it and how you take care of it<br>thank you and it's really good for us to<br>hear from both of you to know that<br>this precious collection has been so<br>well looked after and carefully<br>preserved for<br>future generations which is fantastic<br>well i see that we've<br>come to a 258 so we're coming close to<br>the end of<br>our um session and there are no more<br>questions<br>i just like to remind all the<br>participants if you do think of any<br>questions<br>after we finish
