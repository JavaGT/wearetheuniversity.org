Facing this problem, the design of public spaces is presented as a key component in the adaptation to current and expected urban flood events. In addition, climate change adaptation endeavours have already entered the urban agenda and are influencing urban planning and public space design approaches. This emerging tendency is further prompting new flood management paradigms that acknowledge the practice of integrating ecosystems and the natural water cycle.<br><br>“Public Spaces for Water: A Design Notebook” displays a different approach to tackle the urgent problem of urban flooding. In this lecture, the importance of public space design in adaptation action is explored and traditional flood risk management practices are challenged. As public spaces provide the opportunity to integrate and reveal the complex connections between natural, social and technical processes, designing “for water” is a present and urgent matter on which the future of our cities relies.<br><br>Maria Matos Silva is an Assistant Professor of Landscape Architecture at Instituto Superior de Agronomia (ISA), University of Lisbon. She graduated in Landscape Architecture (University of Lisbon, 2007), completed a master’s degree in Urban Design (University of Barcelona, 2010) and a PGDip in Urban and Regional Planning (University of Lisbon, 2011).

also request you to remain muted<br>throughout the talk<br>and at the end there will be an<br>opportunity for you to ask questions<br>either verbally<br>or you can write them in a chat box<br>without further ado please join me in<br>giving maria a warm welcome<br>hello thank you very much for the<br>invitation<br>uh indeed it's it's a great pleasure to<br>be here with you<br>uh first of all because you are a dear<br>friend<br>uh and it's very it's very good to be<br>in a place where we never imagined we<br>would be when we were studying<br>so it's it's uh it's it's been a great<br>adventure<br>being friends with you uh i will i will<br>first i have to put here in the<br>powerpoint on<br>yes and i put here<br>i will share no am i sharing already<br>not really not really<br>tell the doulish yes i want to share<br>english<br>yes sorry<br>i'm having a bit of trouble because i'm<br>not<br>being very smart comfortable now it's<br>coming in<br>okay<br>now here can you see the title<br>yeah okay perfect<br>so you see uh the title uh<br>and i would like to also thank bruno of<br>course but also<br>to the uh the new zealand institute of<br>landscape architecture<br>and also the victoria university of<br>wellington<br>i have been watching some of the the<br>lectures from this series and they were<br>very stimulating and i congratulate all<br>for for this initiative it's great to<br>have<br>uh talks on this on this matter um<br>as bruno told you i will speak about<br>public spaces for water<br>i will essentially divide this<br>presentation in three moments<br>uh the first of all will be to try to<br>explain<br>what do i mean by public spaces for<br>water uh<br>then the second moment i will talk about<br>a conceptual framework of flood<br>adaptation measures that are applicable<br>in the design of public spaces<br>which essentially will be about the<br>contents of a<br>recently published book and finally i<br>will try to evaluate some of these<br>measures<br>identified in this conceptual framework<br>in the particular case<br>of the city of lisbon so<br>starting off with the problem matter how<br>all this<br>started this this is a part<br>of my phd research that was finished in<br>2016<br>and the problem matter was flooding was<br>was the fact that flooding was a<br>recurrent phenomenon uh<br>that was pretty much uh intense<br>and that it will very likely<br>continue that trend in the future<br>not only due to climate change that we<br>all know are<br>all aware of but also in case<br>or if we continue the the business as<br>usual<br>path right following conventional<br>uh forms of how to deal with floods<br>and cities are particularly vulnerable<br>to floods as we know and<br>within cities then public spaces are<br>even more<br>uh vulnerable to climate change and to<br>flood events<br>we all know also that public spaces are<br>extraordinarily adaptable right um<br>but under a pattern of uh relatively<br>stable changes<br>when these changes start to become like<br>many<br>scientists say about climate change<br>without precedence right<br>um so in in a in a scale that we have<br>never seen before<br>then we argue that public spaces they<br>might not have<br>the same autonomous adaptation capacity<br>and that is why the concept of<br>adaptation gains strength<br>so it is this also this inclusion<br>in contrast with traditional forms of<br>plan<br>sustainable planning and flood risk<br>management that besides considering<br>their decisions or basing their<br>decisions<br>on the analysis of past trends<br>the adaptation processes they then add<br>up<br>uh also the consideration of<br>uh possible future climates through<br>projections and simulations so<br>they join together this exposed analysis<br>based on knowledge<br>factual so observation and it's pretty<br>much objective<br>and the x anti-analysis that's based on<br>assumption<br>prognosis and it's fundamentally<br>subjective<br>right so adaptation<br>very in a very brief way i mean we can<br>we<br>could talk about the concept for an hour<br>but in a very brief way it can be seen<br>as an instrument as a tool<br>that might help us to deal with<br>uncertainty<br>not only the uncertainty about the<br>evolution process<br>of any city but also the uncertainty<br>about<br>anything that relates to the future<br>right we<br>we can never anticipate what's going to<br>happen<br>these uncertainties have been widely<br>acknowledged as something that<br>must be considered in the way we<br>when we look to flood management<br>practices or or the way<br>we have been managing floods throughout<br>history<br>we note uh very clearly that<br>first civilizations they lived with<br>floods and they<br>were able to uh take the most out of<br>floods<br>for example to fertilize the soils while<br>also being very<br>aware of its dangers of its dangers<br>um it was it was<br>next civilizations that started to<br>understand floods as something that<br>would bring<br>more harm than good right only by the<br>end of the century<br>and and probably<br>connected to the first climate change<br>projections but also<br>uh some catastrophic events such as the<br>katrina<br>did we realize that couldn't we could<br>not protect<br>defend control or even manage any<br>natural system<br>in its entirety uh and so we shifted our<br>focus we shifted our focus from<br>trying to reduce the probability of<br>communities to experience floods and we<br>started to focus<br>on the reduction of society's<br>vulnerabilities<br>this change is a paradigm change this<br>makes it completely different<br>we stopped wanting to manage we stopped<br>wanting to manage floods<br>and we started to to want to manage the<br>risk<br>of flooding so focusing on this<br>vulnerability<br>and this what this did also was that<br>besides<br>considering structural and rigid<br>measures we started to think<br>also about other types of measures that<br>would be more flexible<br>and that would uh actually work on this<br>matter<br>of uh trying to reduce society's<br>vulnerabilities<br>and how can we reduce society's<br>vulnerabilities<br>so if this is this is the point that i<br>want to reach in the first part<br>one of the ways which we could reduce<br>society's vulnerabilities is through<br>public space design<br>through uh not only the question of<br>design that design can<br>actually um communicate right<br>but also the the subject matter the<br>bottom line of being a public space or<br>being the place of communities of where<br>people can actually uh relate to<br>for example the natural phenomenon of a<br>flood<br>um and and this this affirmation<br>beside this hypothesis it can be um<br>um evidenced in many cities such as<br>rotterdam new york or london<br>uh that very early on in this adaptation<br>agenda have matured their relationship<br>with water through uh the design of<br>public spaces that<br>recognize waters resilient capacities<br>and we're able to<br>uh connect the infrastructure with<br>uh with people right through these<br>examples which<br>these ones here mentioned rotterdam new<br>york but also dubra<br>and chicago which actually encompassed<br>the most comprehensive adaptation<br>plans and most ambitious and money-wise<br>right<br>um but a few others together with<br>literature review<br>it was possible to to highlight some of<br>them<br>what the challenges that the inclusion<br>of flood adaptation measures within the<br>design of public space<br>has brought to contemporary urbanism and<br>urban design practices<br>and i'll try to sum up them so the first<br>of all<br>all of these had this common goal of the<br>requirement to abide<br>with further expanded horizons so<br>not only to consider the next 50 years<br>or the next 100 years<br>in the planning design but also the but<br>also the the next 150 years 200 years<br>the acknowledgements unrealistic and<br>unwise<br>so basically recognize our limitations<br>as human beings in the planet<br>they need<br>the articulation with other municipal<br>agendas<br>and ongoing programs um<br>basically the the search for synergies<br>for<br>in order to to get the most out of<br>resources<br>uh the search and combination for a<br>combination of multiple strategies and<br>solutions so<br>to get rid of the idea that it is<br>possible to to fix<br>the problem with a single solution the<br>the one-size-fits-all approach<br>and finally the compliance with the<br>notion of public space as an urban<br>system an urban system that<br>it was also possible to to verify<br>that<br>citizens are more likely to implement<br>effective adaptation actions and that's<br>in order to deal with those existing<br>vulnerabilities uh<br>well competent municipalities are close<br>to its citizens<br>and that's because they are more uh<br>close to uh have the know-how and<br>experience<br>to deal with uh with the vulnerabilities<br>they feel<br>of course there's a lot this is a<br>questionable argument but it's it's a<br>starting point<br>these are two pictures of lisbon in a<br>hot summer day<br>uh and you see how very quickly some<br>citizens<br>uh just decided to adapt um<br>so another point that i would like to<br>make is that<br>public spaces as as as being public<br>spaces as being places for everyone<br>community places<br>entail specific characteristics that are<br>particularly beneficial for uh<br>the implementation of adaptation actions<br>and i'll also try to systematize those<br>so<br>public spaces favor interdisciplinary<br>design<br>in places founded through<br>interdisciplinary means<br>we are all i believe we all agree on<br>that<br>uh innovative thinking more easily<br>emerges right<br>nowadays nothing good comes out of doing<br>almost of doing your jobs alone<br>public spaces also embrace multiple<br>purposes by combining flood adaptation<br>measures with<br>public space design agents and purposes<br>are likely to also<br>be part of from other sectoral needs<br>such as<br>water purification microclimatic<br>meteoration<br>and so forth public spaces<br>may promote community engagement so by<br>engaging community<br>in the design and in the construction of<br>that public space with that<br>purpose for that infrastructural purpose<br>you can it's possible to<br>raise awareness not only about climate<br>change<br>but also it may lead to a<br>self-determining<br>need for and willingness to<br>act for action and monitoring<br>public spaces they are supported by an<br>extensive physical structure<br>which when we think about uh<br>flood management is particularly useful<br>public spaces expose and share value<br>instead of camouflaging it underground<br>in underground drainage or<br>in an area that is restricted that you<br>cannot go<br>and finally public spaces also promote<br>risk diversification<br>and communal monitoring<br>and i'm saying this because through<br>public spaces if you implement these<br>measures in the public spaces<br>you are investing in more than one<br>strategy more than one public space<br>and that risk not only risk is<br>dissipated but then<br>different actors from different places<br>and different communities<br>might also serve uh to be my it's more<br>likely they become involved<br>in the management and monitoring of that<br>uh it's it's nevertheless very important<br>to highlight and especially in the<br>moments in the in the<br>historical moment that we're living<br>these days of the pandemic<br>um that the more work that that needs to<br>be done<br>in the local scale there's still a lot<br>of work to be done we may never forget<br>the efforts<br>uh that are also necessary on the global<br>scale<br>these are two efforts that are<br>completely dependent on one another<br>it's when we talk about the same the<br>same thing happens when we talk about<br>the duality between mitigation and<br>and adaptation it's two sides of the<br>same coin<br>right if if on the one half of the on<br>the one hand mitigation can give us<br>uh uh very important knowledge uh<br>and has that those decisions that are<br>top down adaptation then you can<br>uh uh say that gives us the the critical<br>wisdom<br>so and we need both in order to<br>get where we want<br>so now there are a lot of public spaces<br>and i'm sure you know<br>a lot of them that through design have<br>approximated people and communities with<br>uh the natural water cycle and its<br>associated processes<br>there are even other designs other<br>projects that have<br>been specifically designed for the<br>primary<br>primary reason of flood adaptation<br>yet in in this stage uh uh<br>what i wanted to do in the phd was also<br>to assess<br>existing types of of solutions<br>existing types of measures that were<br>applied to public space<br>in a way so i could have a range of them<br>and then i could<br>um with that systematization understand<br>uh how could i use it in a more<br>mainstreamed way<br>in our cities so it was<br>the goal was this creation of a<br>conceptual framework<br>uh that would exactly give me that<br>systematization process<br>and results obviously uh so<br>through a wide range of examples<br>literature review and so on<br>um it was a i was able to to um<br>systematize 40 types of adaptation<br>measures they were then<br>organized in 16 categories<br>these categories and types of measures<br>they then could be<br>organized in very in various different<br>ways<br>i chose to organize them through their<br>infrastructural<br>strategy but i could have organized them<br>for example on the how much they cost to<br>implement<br>or how much they cost to to be<br>maintained<br>or uh where in the water basin are they<br>more<br>more suitable sorry<br>or their ecological value<br>uh their social value i mean i could<br>have organized it very differently<br>what would be important is that is to<br>understand that these measures they<br>related to they were related to one<br>another<br>so if i want uh uh so i needed to build<br>another a different chart that was not a<br>tree chart<br>but a chart in this format of a pie<br>where i could<br>if i wanted to to look for uh very<br>quickly the types of measures that would<br>help me<br>in the initial brainstorm phases of a<br>project would help me to know<br>the types of measures for storing water<br>i would consider not only these ones<br>that directly<br>that are directly connected to to that<br>uh infrastructural strategy<br>but i would also consider the other<br>measures that are<br>indirectly connected to that strategy so<br>this diagram gives<br>that flexibility of adding new measures<br>of<br>taking off uh other measures so this is<br>supposed to be an open uh process where<br>we could um continue to grow on it<br>on it and essentially it serves uh uh<br>four initial stages for discussion uh uh<br>and that's and that was the purpose of<br>it of course all the detailed um<br>methodology it's on the phd and also on<br>that publication up there<br>if you are uh curious you can find it<br>very easily<br>on the internet um and also a simplified<br>version of all this conceptual framework<br>you can it can be seen on the book this<br>is my<br>the the commercial parts uh one second<br>of commercial parts<br>you can look for it in the ruthless<br>webpage<br>i don't know if i'm pronouncing it right<br>in the in the talon francis group<br>um i can also for those who are<br>interested send you a voucher<br>with a 20 discount if you want to just<br>chat there and i and i make sure the<br>posture gets to you<br>um i had have i had the the honor to be<br>to have the forward by professor jack<br>hearn a professor of landscape<br>architecture in the university of<br>massachusetts<br>whose work has greatly inspired the<br>first years of my phd<br>studies and i also must mention the the<br>the support of from my research center<br>from the<br>landscape architecture association of<br>portugal<br>but the book develops upon this idea of<br>public spaces for water<br>it describes each identified type of<br>measure uh<br>through uh uh sketches uh for of the<br>typologies<br>um and it also uh<br>is talks about a lot of examples so for<br>each type it's it's explained<br>in in more detail and for uh uh<br>and and and it gives a lot of examples<br>that are also illustrated<br>uh like floating pathways<br>flowing floating islands by retention<br>planters<br>uh cisterns from the stata center what<br>they have in common is that they're all<br>uh existing uh designs that they they<br>exist they were constructed<br>and there is this critical uh aspect and<br>critical point of view in the book about<br>how to connect the infrastructure<br>with public space and how people can<br>relate with that infrastructure<br>these designs are not my own they are<br>from a colleague they are very beautiful<br>they i brought them here to serve some<br>sort of<br>teaser for for the book they are from<br>and there are a lot of these in the book<br>so i've talked about what i mean<br>what i mean i tried to explain what i<br>mean by public spaces for water<br>i talked to you about the conceptual<br>framework<br>and now in the final five ten minutes uh<br>i would like to try to assess this<br>proposed conceptual framework in the<br>case of lisbon<br>uh to see if if it's useful if it makes<br>sense<br>still in this moment in time well this<br>moment was<br>uh three years ago but still it still<br>makes some sense so for those of you of<br>you who don't<br>know very well lisbon uh uh<br>it's there in the in the tale of europe<br>you see that<br>uh yellow um blue arrow<br>and i chose lisbon for this assessment<br>not only because it is my hometown<br>but also because it is a very densely<br>urbanized<br>territory with a chronic<br>problem of flooding that has this<br>tendency<br>of of becoming worse um<br>briefly characterizing the city so it's<br>uh<br>characterized by a torrential<br>precipitation regime so it means that it<br>rains<br>severely in winter and if there's a big<br>moment of lack of water in in<br>summer so there's when it rains it rains<br>a lot and when it doesn't rain into the<br>rain<br>um and also has uh lisbon has this uh<br>land morphology uh that is characterized<br>by<br>uh a lot of very small geographic basins<br>with steep slopes with the exception of<br>that huge one there that you see which<br>is the alcantara valley<br>uh geographic basin the alcantara basin<br>that but this type of configuration it<br>promotes<br>a lot of uh the so-called flash floods<br>it's also a city that it's very much<br>influenced by<br>the tigers dynamics so that will affect<br>mostly the waterfront uh of the city<br>uh and it's also a city with the very<br>old<br>uh and obsolete uh drainage<br>system in this<br>small exercise in this small assessment<br>i focused<br>uh only on uh the<br>floods from uh there were pluvial uh<br>floods right that had the origin in rain<br>that would give rise to the so-called<br>flash floods<br>and also on the basic principle of<br>sustainable urban drainage<br>which is that all rain water can be<br>managed before it goes into the<br>underground drainage system<br>and that has benefits not only<br>ecological but also<br>social and economic<br>and also um i was also guideline<br>used the guidelines of the new york city<br>green infrastructure plan<br>uh that uh had a a methodology<br>that was particularly interesting<br>because it was quantitative<br>um and and because it served to test<br>essentially<br>what we call a green infrastructure but<br>applied in the local scale so not that<br>strategic vision but the vision of<br>a great infrastructure applied locally<br>and it's also a plan that's been on<br>since 2010 so it's<br>also has a couple of years in order to<br>that is that enables me to assess the<br>quality and the results are<br>are actually impressive but this<br>methodology basically<br>us puts on the table that it is possible<br>to<br>manage at the first 25 millimeters of<br>rainwater that fall<br>within a totally impermeable<br>area and and you can catch those 25<br>the first first flush 25 millimeters of<br>water<br>through a public through a retrofit that<br>would only<br>take a percentage of that impermeable<br>so with this premise and then a<br>particularly<br>targeted uh uh methodology<br>i studied three types of measures or the<br>three types of<br>um uh i geographic uh smaller<br>hydrographic basins within<br>this bigger area of the upper area of<br>the alcantara basin<br>and applied different types of measures<br>from the conceptual framework<br>that were that i previously talked about<br>um and i then extrapolated those results<br>into the entire upper basin<br>uh following the basic principles of<br>contemporary stormwater management that<br>is<br>applied extensively throughout the<br>territory<br>and also bearing in mind an extended<br>time frame<br>of course the results for for us<br>landscape architects were not very<br>surprising<br>regardless uh let me say it was possible<br>to<br>verify through very conservative<br>analysis<br>through this exercise that i've if i<br>could retrofit if i could change<br>only five percent of those impermeable<br>public spaces<br>i was able to retain a thousand and two<br>hundred cubic meters<br>if i was able to retrofit forty five<br>percent<br>then i was able to sustain uh uh<br>and retain uh 75 million cubic meters<br>these numbers are not impressive they<br>i just said before um conservative<br>um regardless if we consider<br>the drainage master plan that was for<br>the city of lisbon<br>that in order to resolve the situation<br>of<br>of the upper area of the alpha basin<br>would um<br>implement two reservoirs that in total<br>would have the capacity of<br>51 and 500 cubic meters<br>then the argument is simple is that<br>these two types of strategies<br>they are comparable and they must be<br>equally considerate<br>i do not consider that hard<br>infrastructure is not<br>necessary quite the contrary the<br>reservoirs the underground reservoirs or<br>the deviation tunnels which by the way<br>it's<br>an improvement from the uh um<br>or an update from the previous master<br>plan that<br>is currently being constructed in<br>construction<br>uh they might they can be considered as<br>fundamental<br>and and critical in order to solve uh<br>problems<br>in a very quick way and in the short<br>time frame<br>there's nothing better than this<br>regardless<br>when we consider the uncertainties but<br>also the certainties about climate<br>change<br>then this type of conventional measures<br>they might rapidly become inadequate so<br>it's it is a matter of looking again at<br>this moment in time of this paradigm<br>shift and to think about if we are<br>indeed reducing<br>or making all the efforts to reduce<br>society's vulnerabilities<br>and i do believe that the question here<br>is that the unequal investment at least<br>should be made<br>on this other strategy a territorial<br>strategy<br>uh whose major goal is on the<br>reduction of vulnerability and its focus<br>on the long run<br>and not only in the effective and most<br>quick way<br>to get rid of water<br>um so uh<br>if we are able to converge uh the<br>network of public spaces together with<br>an encompassing stormwater management<br>plan<br>in the same territorial vision<br>that emerges from the local scale we are<br>offering an improved strategy<br>uh to tackle this recurring phenomenon<br>of urban flooding a strategy that will<br>include most definitely the drainage<br>plans but it will also include plans of<br>collection storage decoration transport<br>infiltration but most of all and that's<br>the<br>the the big purpose of the theme of<br>public spaces for water<br>a systemic strategy that will also serve<br>for communities<br>to rethink their relationship with the<br>natural dynamics of flood events<br>a systemic strategy that will in every<br>single<br>public space retrofit will strive to<br>keep water where it lies<br>will accommodate water where it goes but<br>most of all that will value water as the<br>most precious<br>resource that it is i'd like to to<br>to to highlight something that you are<br>all aware<br>of is that water plants and storm water<br>management plans<br>it's it's already mainstreamed in many<br>major cities<br>uh victoria in australia for example<br>it's it's one of them<br>and i'm sure most cities will eventually<br>follow the path<br>of uh successful adaptation achievements<br>yet there's also question of timing<br>right and as we know through the the<br>history of cities<br>we must we mustn't lose the train<br>otherwise we'll<br>we can't so positively<br>influence the course of a more resilient<br>uh urban environment um<br>actually i'm finishing i'm quicker than<br>i thought maybe i spoke too<br>too so fast but just finishing now and<br>wrapping up<br>uh on the positive notes for my hometown<br>that lisbon is uh the green capital has<br>won the green capital award<br>uh and that's because as you as you as<br>you<br>as you were thinking it did a huge<br>amount of efforts and successful efforts<br>in order to become<br>a more sustainable city one of them<br>is um uh the the works being done at<br>prasad spain<br>that is currently under construction<br>designed by the portuguese landscape<br>architecture office<br>it is a great example of a new public<br>space a public park<br>that will reveal the course of water and<br>therefore approximate people with the<br>natural dynamics of an urban water<br>system<br>thank you for listening and i look<br>forward to your<br>thank you maria for that very inspiring<br>lecture<br>around water and it's always good to see<br>our hometown um<br>now it's the time for people to post<br>their questions you can either<br>ask them directly to maria don't forget<br>to unmute yourself<br>or if you feel a little shy you can<br>always type them in the chat box and<br>we'll<br>we will read them in order to<br>give you some time to think about uh<br>your your question<br>i will start by asking one to maria<br>um water management i think is one of<br>those<br>issues that uh every landscape architect<br>scenario later will face it<br>professionally um and also is one of<br>those uh<br>topics that um<br>it's interesting to deal with uh with<br>city councils and politicians<br>and engineers uh that um<br>you know are more around<br>and built infrastructure and and also<br>about expensive<br>what's your opinion about um<br>how how ready are we as a profession<br>to deal with water and how ready are we<br>to actually engage with these<br>well bruno i think when we say when you<br>say we you're saying landscape<br>architecture<br>yes yes yeah uh well i think we<br>are ready we have been ready for ages<br>we we we know how to do this<br>so i don't think this is a problem of um<br>of uh of knowledge on tech it's not a<br>technical problem<br>uh uh and and we you could we can argue<br>that other professions<br>they uh might need to rethink<br>um their their actions in the only in<br>the sense that<br>they were too accustomed to um to know<br>um to<br>to assume that the climate was<br>stationary was not<br>changing but we have that flexibility<br>since since the the conception of<br>landscape architecture so that's not<br>something that's<br>very much new i do believe that the<br>challenge<br>is more uh uh related to<br>how we will connect this with society<br>it's more societal change<br>and also um how can we take the<br>advantage of this new way of<br>of us to reach to rethink uh<br>as a society this new the green deal<br>right the thing<br>of of uh rethinking on how we can live<br>in in a different world and how we can<br>use that and channelize that in our<br>profession i think that's that will be<br>the challenge i don't think it's<br>a technical challenge can be a political<br>challenge<br>but also the political is completely<br>connected to the social challenge<br>because police politicians<br>just they do what we want we just need<br>to know what we want<br>and we need to act on it so you think<br>that is<br>uh i don't<br>see it so much as educating um<br>i i think it's more um<br>on the other hand we cannot we cannot<br>put the<br>the all that effort and all that need to<br>change<br>over people right people just want to<br>live their lives<br>uh uh in the best way possible when when<br>i say societal change i mean<br>uh indeed we are in a moment where we<br>must we<br>are rethinking and we are doing that<br>everywhere<br>we are retain we're thinking our role in<br>the planet where do we want to live<br>in what world we want to live uh<br>and i think but i think that's still its<br>challenge that's still something we are<br>discovering<br>and landscape architecture is looking at<br>in that way where<br>it makes sense where our profession can<br>can go in that sense<br>of course technically we can always<br>improve i mean there's a lot still to be<br>learned about<br>uh the power of plants to to purify<br>uh toxics from from the city i mean we<br>don't know everything of course there's<br>still<br>a lot to be to be learned uh but the<br>major<br>issues i see it more as as that<br>connection<br>uh uh as as some as a changing<br>um there needs a change in in our way to<br>uh and how we where we want to live<br>right and that's that's also a challenge<br>for us<br>as designers perfect<br>maria hello this is maria anthony<br>and thank you so much maria for your<br>presentation it's really<br>really interesting my question is<br>uh earlier in your presentation you<br>mentioned that you know<br>over centuries um humans have<br>coexisted with flooding and have<br>different adaptations so i'm wondering<br>um you know if you see those precedents<br>informing current practices<br>and if you are exploring some of those<br>in your book and or how you incorporated<br>that in<br>knowledge into your um body of work<br>thank you for your question um<br>well it's what i've<br>the way i've incorporated that knowledge<br>is is very simple this was just<br>uh the fact that the in the evolution<br>process of citizens change<br>and and they have and they and they<br>sometimes they go back<br>and forth in order to go forward right<br>uh and<br>and that change we can we have a lot to<br>learn from past civilizations and<br>definitely that's one of them<br>regardless it's never the same right<br>it's never the same we have to<br>um uh the question of risk and<br>the question of to reduce society's<br>vulnerabilities<br>uh it's it's not linear when because<br>sometimes<br>when when you when uh advocate the<br>inclusion of flood adaptation measures<br>within<br>public spaces we are assuming the<br>reliance of a local scale<br>and social response and in our<br>contemporary society that's not linear<br>right when you can actually<br>do a design that can uh<br>communicate with people about and can<br>make climate change visible<br>in in the most strict way and that can<br>have<br>and that can work very well some people<br>can be connected and<br>can work in that sense and can change a<br>community<br>but it can also work on the quite the<br>reverse<br>so in in that sense the solution would<br>be<br>that's also part of the adaptation<br>concept would be to<br>have permanent and continuous monitoring<br>in any adaptation plan so monitoring and<br>learning<br>um but yes there's a lot of<br>those civilizations that are in the book<br>some of some examples<br>one of them is the powers in india uh<br>most beautiful tanks that uh have this<br>technique to to store water uh and to<br>use it<br>um also because the it's very<br>encompassing the<br>the the scope the scope of uh flooding<br>it's not only about stormwater<br>management it's about all types of<br>flooding<br>uh not only bluefield flooding so you<br>would have also floating<br>mechanisms and technologies that were<br>used since the aztecs<br>and yes most definitely we have to look<br>at history and learn from the past<br>i i'm not sure if i replied to your<br>question i was my question<br>i think yeah yes<br>we answer um<br>laura was asking for you to share again<br>this slide about<br>goals um but i think laura<br>i will answer on behalf of maria this<br>lecture<br>is being recorded so once the recording<br>is ready i will be sharing the link with<br>all the participants<br>so you're going to have the opportunity<br>to recheck the slides again<br>and there is another question to start<br>in portuguese i will try my best to<br>um to translate that for our<br>non-portuguese speakers<br>it's from raquel freya and<br>she's asking um or she's commenting<br>that at times environmental agencies<br>are far more stricter you know i think<br>they allow<br>as designers or anyone to work with<br>waterways<br>she's also committing that uh there is<br>lots of work<br>to be done and especially among<br>governmental agencies<br>and in in city councils um<br>not entirely sure if there is a question<br>here uh maria<br>do you want to comment on that yes i i<br>can i mean<br>uh there's obviously a challenge uh<br>uh politics-wise um<br>the the the bar the the basic principle<br>of this type of of water plants that i'm<br>talking about<br>that it implies a long time frame<br>there's already a very<br>there's already a very big uh<br>difficulty in in the politics field<br>because uh in in because usually those<br>measures that promote climate change<br>adaptation that promotes<br>uh stormwater management plans they are<br>still<br>not very um acceptable for communities<br>uh and that's where where i go again to<br>the societal changes<br>where do we want to live because<br>politicians they are very<br>opportunistic in a way they will do what<br>we want<br>we need to want that and they will<br>follow<br>and the regulations will follow but we<br>are not so much ready for that in in the<br>sense that<br>we have other priorities uh<br>we have the priority of having um<br>uh other things other other comforts<br>uh the fact that when it rains in a city<br>you do not want to wet your feet you do<br>not want you cannot<br>catch any rain it's parts also of our<br>culture as portuguese it's there's<br>something<br>uh major than that but it is difficult<br>and we're still in the long way<br>what i can tell you raquel also is that<br>um<br>i there a lot of major cities have<br>implemented this type of plans<br>and you can look in australia you can<br>look at new zealand you can<br>look in new york london and you see<br>it is possible and these municipalities<br>are indeed doing<br>a lot of very interesting things the<br>other principalities they will follow<br>eventually<br>participants<br>i'm having problems with my things sorry<br>what did you say<br>i was just saying a while i would give<br>some more moments for people to probably<br>think about your questions<br>and looking at the question of landscape<br>architecture<br>what do you see as future challenges<br>what what should we be doing that we<br>mariah<br>okay i'm good did you<br>did you hear my question you know<br>i'm saying like um looking at our<br>profession of<br>you know as landscape architects what<br>should we be preparing you know future<br>wise<br>and what should we be doing that we<br>that's a very hard question you're being<br>um<br>isaac my wish my biggest wish was with<br>is not only concerned about landscape<br>architecture<br>it's something that we all talk about<br>very often<br>but i don't see it as often in in in<br>the real life is to actually<br>be more um to do more interdisciplinary<br>work<br>we know this we we argue this we we<br>write about it<br>but in practice then we don't see it so<br>often<br>but the truth is when you go to the best<br>designs when you go to the best<br>solutions when you go to see those real<br>reference cases you see who was working<br>there and you see<br>an amazing team full of different<br>specialties<br>so what i know is that talking about<br>myself and my profession<br>i i'm most definitely dependent on<br>all the hydro the the engineers<br>hydraulic engineers<br>uh uh stormwater management engineers<br>but also<br>people from urbanism people from uh the<br>social uh<br>scientists uh sciences uh architecture<br>uh environmental science i mean<br>the the the difficulty will be to<br>improve on our capacities<br>to i think that will be something that i<br>would like to do<br>i cannot speak so much generally i<br>haven't think put too much thought about<br>it<br>that's an excellent answer all right<br>i think it's something that um as we<br>said we keep<br>complaining about that we should have<br>more<br>you know diverse interdisciplinary teams<br>but then<br>we exclude them once we get into our<br>projects<br>okay um there is another<br>question from simon in the chat box and<br>very interesting presentation<br>thank you in your proposals for<br>listening<br>can you say which were the predominant<br>techniques you suggested by calling what<br>uh well i went to the the<br>the the types that had the storage as<br>primary and secondary function<br>and i did that um<br>and i used some of them uh through those<br>guidelines of<br>of the new york city master plan uh i<br>don't understand really the<br>by volume of water storage stored what i<br>did was i did a<br>detailed design of those places<br>and so i decided exactly the depth of<br>that infrastructure in the sense that<br>the depth of that<br>how much soil i would put how much<br>um i would say in english greville and<br>and all the the drink<br>the lent all the the the drainage<br>layers so i decided on the materials and<br>on<br>uh the thickness of the layers and i<br>detailed that<br>and with that i was able to estimate the<br>amount of the percentage of water that i<br>could sustain in each layer<br>um through basic calculations of vary of<br>volume um<br>and i did that also with the with the<br>precipitation regime for for lisbon<br>which is not<br>same as in new york um<br>and also in the in the smaller basin so<br>the the<br>the premise was to collect the first<br>flush<br>uh waters um in all that uh<br>smaller basin in that particular and<br>smaller<br>public space intervention<br>i'm not sure if it solves but this<br>this this case this is not really a case<br>study this was more like a work<br>study so i would i was just testing that<br>it was pertinent to still talk about<br>this<br>uh in this particular case i didn't it<br>was it was only like an application<br>to verify the the conceptual framework<br>and that's in the paper that's not in<br>the book lisbon is not in the book<br>well there it is in examples but not<br>and i think we're probably gonna wrap it<br>up here<br>um on behalf of the new zealand<br>institute of landscape architects<br>victoria university of wellington thank<br>you very much<br>for finding time to talk to us today um<br>i think it was a very interesting<br>um presentation and a very interesting<br>overview<br>on on water in public spaces<br>and for those of you that are interested<br>in maria's book<br>once i send out the the<br>link for the video and we will provide<br>more information about the discount<br>vouchers<br>uh you can also contact maria directly<br>she provided her email<br>right at the beginning of the<br>presentation um<br>and thank you very much i wish all the<br>best<br>to maria and to everyone attending this<br>presentation<br>wherever you are based and i hope to see<br>you again<br>soon at our next increasing viewers<br>thank you very much everyone for<br>listening and thank you bruno for the<br>invitation<br>it was a pleasure thank you for joining<br>us<br>you</p></main><footer
