webinar<br>series<br>shaping the future through health<br>sciences and science<br>we are going to introduce our panelists<br>shortly<br>and spend about an hour with you<br>chatting about<br>our roles in this space here at the<br>university of auckland<br>so before we do that it would be<br>wonderful just to give you a bit of an<br>overview of the university of auckland<br>here in auckland city<br>um of course we're launching into our<br>summer here in auckland<br>and we're looking forward to an<br>open sun shiny summer here in new<br>zealand with<br>um auckland at level one in the covered<br>responses so<br>everything is open here we are out and<br>about we've had a fantastic<br>rugby game over the weekend with the all<br>blacks playing<br>australia of course we won we're very<br>excited about that and we're looking<br>forward to seeing<br>you here in new zealand when it's safe<br>to come<br>the university of auckland is new<br>zealand's largest university with 42 000<br>students and about 5 000 staff we're the<br>top-ranked university here in new<br>zealand<br>and we normally welcome over 8 000<br>international students from over 120<br>countries to us<br>we are ranked as the most innovative<br>university in new zealand<br>and also have the best ranking for<br>graduate employability and that's really<br>really<br>important to us you can see that we're<br>located right in the heart of downtown<br>auckland city<br>a city surrounded by harbours here in<br>auckland<br>we have eight faculties and offer over<br>200 programs from undergraduate level<br>all the way up to doctoral space<br>i've listed the faculties here and you<br>can see on the slide<br>some key programs that are important to<br>us<br>and key subject areas we're not going to<br>talk too much about programs during this<br>afternoon<br>but on this slide you can see the link<br>to our study options pages where you can<br>find<br>everything you need to know about our<br>our programs that we offer<br>including opportunities for scholarship<br>including entry requirements program<br>duration<br>and subjects available within our eight<br>faculties<br>here at the university of auckland as<br>i've said we've got a really diverse<br>range of programs but if you're thinking<br>about what we do not offer<br>we don't have dentistry here in new<br>zealand the university of auckland and<br>nor do we have veterinary science but we<br>do cover<br>pretty much everything else so great to<br>have you with us<br>we're going to talk about our partner<br>universities now<br>over 180 partners in 45 countries<br>and the university of auckland is a<br>member of<br>three global networks for universities<br>the apru which is<br>obviously as its name describes the asia<br>pacific rim universities network<br>universitas 21 and the worldwide<br>universities network which is a research<br>focused network<br>we have links into over 100 countries<br>about 180 countries as you can see here<br>180 partners as you can see here in 45<br>countries and our students are used to<br>being connected<br>internationally one of the most<br>important<br>things that we celebrate here at the<br>university of auckland<br>is our impact rankings so we're the<br>number one university<br>in the world in the times higher global<br>impact rankings<br>and we're going to spend a bit of time<br>in this afternoon session talking about<br>the sdgs the sustainable development<br>goals<br>and uh and our rankings there and how we<br>contribute to those rankings<br>and so stay with us for this session<br>we have with us um professor chris<br>bullen<br>who is a professor of public health and<br>the director of the national<br>institute of health innovation here at<br>the university of auckland<br>professor thomas lumley who's in the<br>department of statistics<br>at the faculty of science associate<br>professor jude mccall<br>who's an associate professor in global<br>health and works in the center for<br>global health<br>at the faculty of medical and health<br>sciences and<br>dr nikki moreland who's a principal<br>investigator at the morris wilkins<br>centre<br>and works within the faculty of medical<br>and health sciences<br>i'm the moderator for this afternoon<br>session my name's karen dorian<br>and um i'm the senior international<br>manager for the faculty of medical and<br>health sciences here at the university<br>of auckland<br>we are delighted to have with us jin<br>seong-chen<br>jimmy um jin song is known as jimmy<br>to us here at the university um jimmy is<br>an alumni<br>of the master of public health and the<br>bachelor of health science here at the<br>university of auckland<br>and is just completing his phd with<br>professor chris bullon<br>jimmy's been awarded a number of<br>scholarships and awards<br>and has success in digital health<br>and functional game development he's<br>based here in the university of auckland<br>okay so on to our first question which<br>i'm going to ask<br>um our academics to respond to<br>so i'm going to suggest that jude<br>answers this question<br>that you see on your screen jude the<br>university of auckland has ranked number<br>one in the global times<br>higher education impact rankings for<br>overall sustainable impact<br>two years in a row in 2019 and in 2020.<br>judy can you tell us what sustainability<br>means to you<br>and why do you think it's important to<br>question traditional thinking<br>about sustainability<br>um thanks karen i really like this<br>question<br>um and i was delighted to see it<br>presented actually because i think these<br>are um i think it really challenges us<br>not<br>to think about what we've done well in<br>the past and sort of<br>to ride on that but also think about how<br>what our vision is collectively<br>as an institution and how we think about<br>how we<br>do sustainability so to speak in the<br>future so one of the things that comes<br>to mind<br>is when i think about traditional<br>thinking<br>uh about sustainability and what that<br>word means it conjures up ideas about<br>environments um ecosystems<br>ecology and things they want to covet<br>and conserve and i think that's still<br>absolutely important particularly in the<br>context of<br>environmental degradation and climate<br>change but i think we need to think more<br>um holistically in the future around<br>sustainability<br>and what i mean by that is thinking<br>about whole systems and how we respond<br>at a systems level to some of the big<br>global challenges<br>i think we need to think about equity<br>and how we can ensure and sustain<br>equitable access to those precious<br>resources that we rely upon<br>and i think in terms of sustainability<br>we need to think about some of the<br>practicalities about<br>making smart decisions ensuring that<br>they can<br>uh be implemented and that they can be<br>sustained so sustainability in terms of<br>sustaining and investing<br>longer term and initiatives that can<br>really have benefit<br>particularly for the most vulnerable but<br>for all and that's in terms<br>and when we think about that how do we<br>respond as a university how do we build<br>capacity<br>to ensure sustainable systems to support<br>life in the future that's a fantastic<br>um answer to kick us off jude thanks so<br>much thomas would you like to<br>contribute as well to this question so<br>the the part of the<br>point as jude said about sustainability<br>is that it's<br>not enough to have good sort of ideal<br>practices<br>you need things that you can actually do<br>and that you can keep doing<br>and that people all over the world can<br>keep doing and one of the<br>sort of things behind this that's<br>important particularly<br>in a university is taking advantage<br>of knowledge and skills and abilities of<br>people<br>inside the university and outside the<br>university<br>you don't want to waste any sort of<br>human abilities human resources with<br>equity not just in the sense<br>of providing things provide making<br>systems that provide things<br>for everyone but making systems that<br>take advantage of everybody's skills and<br>abilities<br>great and nikki do you have something to<br>comment on here<br>sure i mean really i think just echoing<br>and extending the previous comments<br>thinking about having sustainable<br>solutions to health<br>that are really supported by underlying<br>technology and infrastructure<br>that means that when there is a new<br>health challenge that comes along<br>all of their infrastructure and<br>technology and expertise is in place to<br>pivot to what a new challenge would be<br>and i think that's where the<br>universities<br>um play a key role in in the future<br>fantastic thanks very much so um thomas<br>i'm going to ask you to answer this<br>question first<br>considering your discipline what do you<br>think are some of the most important<br>global challenges to address in the next<br>five to 25 years<br>well from the point of view of<br>statistics one of the key challenges as<br>we've seen this year<br>is modelling and understanding<br>infectious disease<br>so that a hundred years ago everyone<br>knew that this was<br>one of the big challenges but we've sort<br>of forgotten about it a bit<br>over past decades and it's come back<br>again so that's a really important<br>area and that's an area where the<br>university of auckland has been<br>playing an important role in the new<br>zealand responses<br>to covet for example um and<br>with test strategies being informed by<br>mathematics and statistics as well as by<br>other relevant disciplines<br>and university of auckland researchers<br>being<br>involved but so that sort that's a sort<br>of modeling<br>statistical area that's a big challenge<br>fantastic and jude with your global<br>health background um what do you think<br>i think um some of the big challenges<br>i mean certainly from from the global<br>health perspective i<br>certainly support what thomas was saying<br>but i think some of the really big<br>challenges but some of the ways that we<br>need to respond and draw upon the value<br>and then the kind of platform that a<br>university lighthouse offers<br>is our connections and ability to<br>cooperate<br>and i think um that's absolutely<br>essential we've seen the importance of<br>that in the covert 19 response the<br>importance of global cooperation<br>the sharing of data the sharing of<br>developments in the vaccine front etc so<br>i think this concept that's often seen<br>as being quite sort of remote of<br>collective action<br>actually is something that universities<br>really do well and i think<br>we're we're positioned here in the south<br>pacific<br>it's all about interest it's our it's<br>our viability we have to<br>to connect globally and we make our<br>business to do that we're all known for<br>our travelling<br>but when we're not traveling we have<br>established networks<br>globally and we really work with them<br>and they are looked after very<br>um well by by colleagues here because<br>they matter here in new zealand in terms<br>of what how we translate the work here<br>but they matter in terms of how we can<br>share that knowledge<br>globally so i certainly think<br>cooperation<br>collective action and really good<br>leadership are the things that i think<br>are really important<br>challenges but real opportunities that i<br>think we can take forward when we're<br>based here at auckland university<br>fantastic and chris i'd like to bring<br>you in now with your<br>um health innovation background um would<br>you like to us<br>to um respond to this question as well<br>yes sure so i think um i totally agree<br>with all that's been said by my<br>my colleagues um around some of these<br>challenges obviously there's the huge<br>issue of climate change and we've got<br>not only infectious diseases such as<br>coca-19 to battle with<br>but um we've got the the big uh growing<br>burden of non-communicable diseases and<br>in fact there's a um<br>you know there's an interface between<br>those two things both uh<br>for example covert it's not just the<br>infection but it's the response to the<br>infection and the impact that's having<br>on<br>people's equitable access to health<br>services<br>and how that's playing out in their<br>management of diabetes or heart disease<br>and prevention and and treatment and so<br>forth<br>so i think there are all of this this<br>from a solutions perspective<br>definitely needs partnerships<br>collaborations<br>cooperation and innovation and we've<br>already<br>shown that as a human race we can<br>innovate very quickly when there's a<br>disruption<br>and we can put in place systems or step<br>them up<br>very quickly the way we're working here<br>on zoom is now second nature<br>to us but just a few months ago for many<br>people<br>it was a very new thing and so we're<br>able to reach out<br>communicate with each other around the<br>globe and have these kind of discussions<br>and work on collaborative solutions and<br>i think that's the way forward is<br>uh working with the infrastructure that<br>we have<br>um expanding it to reach the the<br>people in the farthest regions so they<br>have access to knowledge information for<br>action<br>and then cooperating uh to tackle<br>um these huge uh challenges that we face<br>as a human race on our planet<br>fantastic and nikki i don't want to miss<br>you out on this question would you like<br>to just add a couple of um comments as<br>well<br>yeah i think i could just add a quick<br>comment and then it's just picking up<br>on the end of what chris said around<br>working together in collaboration<br>i think what's really important in our<br>in our response is our ability as well<br>to work<br>cross-disciplinary so bringing together<br>people with all sorts of different<br>expertise you know ranging from<br>public health biomedical science some<br>really fundamental science and<br>mathematics<br>and bringing you know a really broad<br>area of expertise to work on a problem<br>fantastic i think that kind of leads us<br>really really nicely into this next<br>question which is what is the role that<br>universities<br>should or can play in addressing these<br>challenges<br>and chris you've talked about the ncds<br>and um and climate change i wonder if<br>you'd like to<br>just expand on that a fraction<br>yes so i think that auckland university<br>like many other universities<br>sees that it has a responsibility to<br>have impact<br>beyond just teaching and writing<br>research grants and winning awards and<br>all those kind of things that<br>universities have done<br>we see ourselves as very much<br>part of our society and our society's<br>response to these<br>challenges and our global response so<br>we are interested as a university we<br>have particular<br>areas of expertise that we can<br>contribute um<br>alongside our partners in government in<br>non-governmental organizations in the<br>business world<br>in in community<br>organizations to work together<br>and our piece particularly is around<br>discovery discovering<br>new ways of doing things new ideas uh<br>bringing them to fruition<br>through science the application of a<br>whole range from social science through<br>to biomedical science<br>and innovation bringing together you<br>know that through that<br>cross-disciplinary<br>cross-pollination coming up with<br>something new and quite disruptive<br>to address a real challenge we're<br>involved with education<br>bringing through people who have the<br>skills and expertise to face the<br>challenges<br>for successive generations but part of<br>the role of our university is also to<br>critique<br>and comment on what's happening in our<br>country but also more broadly uh in a<br>constructive way of course<br>and and by by you know challenging and<br>tossing around and debating<br>ideas and that's an important role that<br>universities can have as an independent<br>entity<br>uh to to do this um and to to get the<br>debate and the discussion going and<br>that's certainly been the case<br>um over these last few months with cobit<br>19 has been<br>a real debate and challenge we've seen<br>that play out and within our university<br>and also<br>more broadly around the globe with other<br>um centres of uh<br>of thinking and and bringing up these<br>ideas<br>uh to face the global health challenge<br>of covert 19.<br>fantastic thanks nikki would you like to<br>say a couple of words to this as well<br>yeah sure so i think um i think the what<br>what<br>universities can do in addressing these<br>challenges<br>is as chris said you know disrupting a<br>new technology and a lot of that<br>actually comes really actually from<br>quite basic fundamental research<br>sometimes and so i think<br>that that fundamental research has a<br>place in universities and sometimes<br>you know we're not always sure where it<br>may lead but actually what we<br>can see in cobit is a lot of the leading<br>vaccines that initial work<br>was done you know by by protein by a<br>chemist<br>by people in the lab um getting real<br>expertise on these particular<br>vaccine candidates and the technology<br>and how they work<br>and so i think we can't direct<br>underestimate the power of that<br>fundamental basic by<br>medical research as well fantastic<br>i'm going to pass on um this question to<br>you as well nikki so<br>um the university of auckland is ranked<br>number one in the times higher impact<br>rankings<br>two years in a row now for the<br>collective work we're doing in relation<br>to the 17<br>sdgs um how can someone working in your<br>area<br>of science and how and in health look to<br>make an impact themselves<br>so as perhaps as an individual or as a<br>group or<br>department yeah sure so i'll probably<br>give a personal response to that<br>question so i work in the infection and<br>immunity<br>space and my lab is really interested in<br>understanding<br>um the immune response to infectious<br>diseases<br>um and so um we have<br>um for the last wee while been looking<br>at um<br>the immune response to covert and using<br>that to then look at ways to develop<br>antibody tests for covert and we've been<br>doing that locally<br>with samples from local participants and<br>local people but<br>in a very internationally connected way<br>and so while we're producing data that<br>is as<br>locally relevant and informing decision<br>making here<br>it's also contributing um to<br>international knowledge<br>and is is quite relevant globally um<br>and in a related example<br>my lab when there's not a pandemic<br>normally work<br>on group a strep which causes rheumatic<br>fever<br>and we're involved in global efforts to<br>try and<br>push forward vaccine development for<br>group a strep and so that's another<br>example<br>of an infectious disease that is highly<br>relevant for us here in new zealand and<br>here in auckland<br>but also has a lot of international or<br>global reach<br>in terms of the impact of the work that<br>we're doing<br>thanks very much nikki and thomas in the<br>department of statistics how<br>can your area contribute so<br>one way we can contribute is by making<br>sort of modern statistical tools<br>available to people everywhere in the<br>world the<br>university of auckland has been a leader<br>in open source statistical software<br>for 30 years the statistical system r<br>comes from here and so that enables<br>people<br>researchers and anywhere in the world<br>to use the sort of modern<br>best modern statistical software best<br>modern statistical techniques<br>in their work no matter what<br>sort of resources they have so that's<br>another area where<br>um<br>great thank you i'm going to pop on to<br>the next question now<br>which is also in relation to our sdg<br>rankings so we ranked um number uh<br>the university um of auckland<br>ranked number four in sdg iii<br>um jude<br>this is a good health and wellbeing<br>ranking and this is particularly<br>pertinent to the conversation we're<br>having<br>what are we doing at the university of<br>auckland that's notable in terms of good<br>health and well-being that can make an<br>impact both here and<br>globally yeah i think we have<br>um a number of really good examples and<br>again i probably will be<br>slightly biased and draw upon those that<br>i'm most familiar with in our faculty<br>um but i think one that was really um<br>one piece of work that was really uh<br>significant in terms of contributing to<br>our<br>how i place in that ranking was the work<br>uh<br>around i guess fetal development work<br>led by<br>um scientists at the ligands institute<br>so they've been<br>really uh i guess in some ways breaking<br>new ground<br>and work around understanding early sort<br>of fetal development<br>um factors and and also looking at the<br>life course taking a life course<br>approach to to<br>health and development more broadly so i<br>think that's been really<br>uh influential and has had um<br>international um<br>uh influence but i think in other areas<br>that perhaps doesn't have quite the same<br>visibility always and necessarily is the<br>area the work that we've been doing in<br>the area of climate change and health so<br>we have colleagues who have been really<br>leading the<br>intergovernmental panel on climate<br>change and health<br>writing groups so this is really<br>important this is that science that's<br>really looking at those impacts<br>of climate on health and then<br>communicating that and having that feed<br>into<br>hopefully global action<br>so that's been important also other<br>areas of work that<br>that i think really significant in terms<br>of changing how we think and<br>hopefully how we do things as i work<br>around<br>understanding obesity from a food<br>systems and environments perspective<br>rather than an<br>individual behavior perspective so<br>we've had colleagues who've led a lancet<br>commission on<br>what's called malnutrition in all its<br>forms so that's thinking about all those<br>factors that that<br>sort of feed into sort of food systems<br>and the impact of those<br>um on on population health so they're<br>really important they have an impact<br>everywhere in the world and as obesity<br>as one of the major contributors<br>to non-communicable diseases we really<br>really have to get a good understanding<br>of that<br>and i think just finally another area<br>that i think has been really significant<br>that our faculty<br>and there are many others i could add<br>many more<br>but i think it's the work that actually<br>chris bolen's group if i can draw upon<br>the work<br>of national institute of health<br>innovation so this is a group<br>um that is really trialling<br>prototyping new tools and innovations to<br>really<br>propel uh change in a way that would<br>otherwise perhaps take a lot longer so i<br>think these are really important and<br>again these adaptable<br>translatable tools often freely<br>available<br>and evidence-based are really based on<br>good theory as well as<br>clinical trials um to validate<br>their impact so i think those that kind<br>of<br>covers a range of of of the strengths i<br>think that our university is really<br>adding to adding value in this in this<br>particular sdg area<br>yeah thanks so much jude you you've um<br>mentioned the work that um<br>nihi or the national institute of health<br>innovation is doing so i think i'll pass<br>on to chris now<br>to ask him to talk about his own work in<br>this space around<br>um the sdg number three good health and<br>well-being<br>um chris can you talk about your own<br>work in this space and and why it's<br>important to sh<br>in shaping the future um thanks and<br>thanks for the shout out there dude<br>uh we all we're all very much part of<br>the team effort and dude<br>and and many others and jimmy uh for<br>example have been very much involved<br>along the journey<br>we've been working for about 15 years in<br>digital health<br>looking at how to use simple digital<br>tools to reach out to as many people as<br>possible<br>with very simple messages and um<br>tools to encourage them to change the<br>behavior in the range of areas and we're<br>looking at um<br>first off the rank was smoking we've<br>been doing that in new zealand and<br>globally<br>using simple sms messaging and testing<br>that in the<br>clinical trials format for efficacy and<br>safety and impact<br>and then we've been able to test that<br>with others<br>partnerships in the cook islands and<br>samoa<br>and um uh elsewhere we've looked at<br>um jimmy's work which he'll talk about<br>has<br>um has huge potential in uh in china and<br>other countries<br>um in this in this area so we think that<br>uh the opportunities now to<br>um to<br>improve people's quality of life and<br>length of life<br>and reduce the risk of acquiring disease<br>can often um occur through giving people<br>um simple tools that are proven<br>uh that have been co-designed with them<br>built on good theoretical models and<br>frameworks<br>tested through the rigorous process of<br>clinical trials<br>and then transfer translated into<br>um you know the real world of delivery<br>and then evaluated in that context<br>that's<br>what what gets me going and um you know<br>it's a real privilege to work with<br>people all around the globe in this area<br>and to see<br>um the the impacts of that happening um<br>uh in in in in a range of areas actually<br>so and not just<br>smoking but also mental health diet and<br>nutrition<br>about problem gambling alcohol<br>consumption<br>um child well-being and so on and so<br>forth actually many of these things are<br>covered off in our<br>complete list of the sdgs when you look<br>at the sdgs there's<br>number three is obviously a health one<br>but in fact all of them are health<br>related in one way or the other<br>just making that point yeah that that's<br>um fantastic thank you chris<br>it's it's really exciting to hear about<br>the work that<br>that you and your group and the wider<br>university are doing in this space<br>because of course we're<br>um we're all connected um to this<br>um nikki with reference to the current<br>global landscape how does the teaching<br>training or research that you're doing<br>in your area<br>contribute to thought leadership needed<br>for a better society<br>i know this is a big picture question<br>but it's an exciting one<br>it is a big picture question i mean i<br>think um to start to answer this<br>question we<br>can think about um in many ways the<br>coded response that we've had in new<br>zealand because this has been<br>a very science-led response<br>so we've continually seen<br>government leaders using science to<br>drive the decisions that have been made<br>in terms of public health<br>and elimination strategies through to<br>understanding<br>you know the research around the virus<br>itself<br>and with our prime minister even talking<br>about different genomes of viruses<br>and i think we've really actually seen<br>the full force of science in many ways<br>in new zealand as part of our pandemic<br>response and that's been echoed globally<br>as well<br>um our work in our lab has only really<br>been possible because of our<br>international connectedness and national<br>collaboration<br>but the actual work in our lab a lot of<br>it has<br>very much been underpinned by early<br>career researchers<br>so a phd student in our lab is the one<br>who developed our first antibody test<br>a postdoc in our lab as the one who<br>developed some of our viral<br>neutralization<br>capabilities and so these are the<br>leaders of tomorrow<br>and yet they are here underpinning our<br>pandemic response today<br>and so you know they're getting trained<br>um<br>right now and we are relying on them<br>and and they are really the ones who are<br>driving a lot of this work forward<br>wow that's really exciting isn't it<br>fantastic<br>um just to change tech a little we've<br>talked a little bit about health<br>innovation<br>um chris you work in health with a focus<br>on health innovation<br>why should we be focusing on these<br>issues and what role can health<br>innovation play in the global community<br>to shape a more sustainable future<br>so i'm going to ask you to respond to<br>this first chris perhaps briefly and<br>then ask<br>jimmy jin song chen to respond after<br>eucharist<br>sure so i think i've already covered a<br>lot of this i mean i think the<br>challenges that um covert 19 has<br>sort of unmasked and revealed are um are<br>many but um<br>we um we do need to come up uh quickly<br>with innovative solutions to problems<br>such as<br>kobe 19 and i'm i'm sure it won't be the<br>last of the global pandemics in many of<br>our lifetimes<br>so we have to be ready and poised<br>to identify new ways of doing things<br>and solving these problems rapidly and<br>collaboratively<br>and so i think uh it's it's not only<br>sort of in our interests for survival<br>um but it's the right thing to do and um<br>and we of course want to do it um with<br>the best information at our fingertips<br>and that's what um<br>places like the university of auckland<br>of course and and our<br>fellow university partners around the<br>globe um are able to help us with<br>um so i'm going to pass on to jimmy to<br>describe his work because he's<br>really been at the cold face of doing<br>some innovative work<br>uh in china and he can<br>give you a much better description than<br>i can of that work<br>thank you chris and um so just following<br>the concept um<br>based on kris ideas and the national<br>institute for health innovations<br>we have just finished a trial back in<br>china but it is a digital trial and<br>is based on the um global wisely used<br>social network platforms we checked and<br>we will be able to test our uh digital<br>products um to helping<br>chinese male smokers to quick smokings<br>in china<br>but like while all the researchers are<br>physically in new zealand and<br>we can have um have a look at all the<br>data back in china with our participants<br>so it's<br>really one of the first in the world and<br>then on top of that<br>by facing kobe 19 we think that's a lot<br>of health innovations<br>will be used in the next decade for<br>example we can use big data to analyze<br>different cases<br>all over the world we can use machine<br>learning to improve efficiencies of<br>drug development we can use digital<br>products to change people's health<br>behavior so all these areas are really<br>important and that they are going to<br>change our landscape of<br>that's fantastic jimmy your work has<br>been<br>recognised obviously with the awards<br>that you've received in<br>in the time that you've been here at the<br>university of auckland but you came to<br>us after having worked<br>or studied in singapore is that correct<br>yes<br>yes yes so you're a truly international<br>individual here at the university of<br>auckland as an international student<br>yes about 10 years ago<br>that's done when i first came to new<br>zealand<br>and um has been a fantastic experience<br>for me fantastic thanks we're going to<br>pop on to the next question now and ask<br>jude<br>um to respond to this jude can you<br>tell us more about the role global<br>health plays in sustainability and the<br>sdgs<br>in today's increasingly interconnected<br>world would we've heard a little bit<br>about this from chris already um<br>and the work he's doing globally and how<br>we're also all interconnected not only<br>just within the university but outside<br>it<br>so um jude over to you to talk about the<br>role global health plays in<br>sustainability<br>and the sdgs yeah again another really<br>good question<br>and and perhaps just to sort of um go<br>straight to the sort of heart of it<br>for me i mean this morning for example<br>i've just come off a zoo meeting<br>um as we all do um but this one is a<br>collaboration that's just<br>been initiated a couple of weeks ago to<br>try and respond to<br>the um concerns that have been raised<br>around the pacific region around<br>mental mental health and well-being and<br>particularly<br>um mental health and access services not<br>just in the time of clover 19 whereas<br>services have been diverted but um<br>at other times as well so it's just a<br>really good example of how we think you<br>know work<br>in global health so we've um engaged<br>with<br>uh partners both in in the islands uh in<br>the ministry of health<br>and university of hawaii and university<br>of queensland so you've got this<br>very swiftly formed collaboration with<br>people on the ground trying to deliver<br>mental health services recognizing and<br>articulating their needs which is we<br>need some data to measure the burden of<br>mental health disorders in the region<br>we also need some training to continue<br>to support our<br>psychiatrists and other mental health<br>people working mental health<br>in the region but no one can leave can<br>you help us<br>so it is around coming together in this<br>environment where we are connected we<br>have those networks<br>um we have built those relationships<br>where people can say<br>we need some support in this area and we<br>can very quickly<br>pull together a team of people who've<br>got the experience and expertise<br>to to think about how we can can<br>contribute and each of us brings<br>something that's distinctive<br>so i think the focus in global health<br>now has shifted<br>certainly 10 and perhaps further back<br>global health was around high income or<br>rich countries<br>going into poorer low income countries<br>and and<br>fixing things so to speak it is not like<br>that anymore it's about what can we<br>learn from other lower resource settings<br>how can we work together and recognizing<br>where actually we do<br>add some value um and where others bring<br>in expertise so i think that's where<br>it's at<br>in terms of sustaining partnerships<br>using those connections we've got and<br>listening and responding to those<br>to those needs and predicting what's<br>coming up in the future as well so to<br>speak so being prepared<br>based on what we've learned about what<br>what we need to to be resourced for<br>um in the future great that's fantastic<br>thanks so much dude now we have got a<br>question from the audience<br>and um we'll we'll um cover the<br>questions from the audience<br>at the end of the session so if you have<br>any other questions you'd like to ask of<br>our panelists<br>please type them in the q a section now<br>and we'll get to them in about<br>10 minutes so we have one question we'll<br>get to<br>in about 10 minutes time um so i'm going<br>to ask<br>jimmy to respond to this next question<br>so jimmy we rank quite highly in the<br>world um<br>ranked 59th in the world for highly<br>employable<br>graduates according to the 2020 qs<br>rankings for<br>graduate employability jimmy on you've<br>been with us for a while why do you<br>think new zealand is a great<br>place to study for someone looking to<br>make<br>a positive impact on the world through<br>their career in science medical and<br>health sciences and<br>in particular for you it's in health<br>innovation<br>yes well thank you karen and i think um<br>a little bit background of myself is i<br>came to here like in 2011 so which is<br>about 10 years ago<br>and it has been a fantastic experience<br>and i would like to<br>stay in different three different scopes<br>first of all is the<br>country level it's the environment the<br>country of um<br>has ethnic diversities is welcome and<br>friendly to all the<br>migrants people all over the world um<br>and on on the other hand is about the<br>university<br>while the universities is really<br>acceptable to<br>to all the informational students and we<br>provide some fantastic facilities<br>to support our study through all the<br>journey<br>and finally it's up to to all the staff<br>of the university especially like my<br>supervisor professor chris poland<br>who have been work together for over<br>five years and<br>he has been he has been really<br>supportive to all my ideas<br>sometimes my some ideas might be naive<br>but like<br>you know he still um shows the<br>supportive and um to tell me what is<br>feasible to do what is um<br>need more work to to to crafting it so<br>all this<br>all the supportive environments that um<br>really boost um<br>the the innovative thinkings and that<br>that's what<br>why where all the fantastic innovations<br>and<br>normal products will be will be will be<br>made<br>that's great thanks very much uh jimmy<br>and um<br>thomas if i could come to you with this<br>question<br>as a supervisor and academic why do you<br>think new zealand's a great place to<br>study<br>one reason is because new zealand's a<br>small<br>country so you've got the opportunity to<br>make connections with all the people who<br>uh in government and non-government<br>organizations and around the country<br>who have a real influence on new zealand<br>policy<br>and that's an opportunity you often<br>wouldn't have in larger countries i<br>think that's something that's really<br>distinctive<br>about what munich new zealand<br>and um nikki would you like to add as a<br>supervisor and<br>yeah i mean i think as a supervisor you<br>know i've<br>just spoken about the opportunities that<br>uh early career researchers have had<br>um in our pandemic response and that's<br>you know really built on that<br>um national i think connectedness and<br>links internationally<br>on a personal level as well i did<br>my phd in auckland quite a number of<br>years ago<br>and then went overseas for further<br>training<br>and but it was really that grounding i<br>got in auckland and then picking up<br>experience from overseas<br>and coming back and establishing my<br>research here that has enabled<br>my group to really grow and flourish um<br>in this sort of nationally and<br>internationally<br>thanks very much and that kind of leads<br>really nicely on to our next question<br>which i'm going to ask<br>thomas to respond to so thomas how is<br>your research helping to make a<br>difference in communities outside new<br>zealand<br>so one project i'm working with<br>is with u.s statisticians designing<br>population health research studies<br>that provide reliable information at<br>lower cost than current approaches<br>which is very important in low resource<br>settings we've already used these<br>through an obesity research<br>study in the us in an hiv study in<br>brazil<br>and we've planning to use them in<br>collaborations we've got<br>with african medical researchers so<br>that's an example<br>in making difference to<br>release to research communities around<br>the world<br>fantastic thanks very much well the next<br>um<br>uh thing we have is the question from<br>the audience<br>so the question from the audience um<br>i'll just read aloud we don't have it on<br>the screen for you<br>here it comes is there any specific<br>roles that government should do<br>for decreasing the number of covered 19<br>oh sorry the number of patient covert 19<br>especially in developing countries<br>uh in particular the strategies for<br>so i'll ask chris to respond to this in<br>the first instance<br>yes sorry no i i quite happy to<br>have a go at um addressing your question<br>thanks very much it's a really important<br>and topical one obviously just a bit of<br>background<br>i'm part of a lancet commission on<br>covert 19<br>public health strategies<br>task force which is a great example of<br>the global<br>collaboration that's currently going on<br>in order to try and address<br>the the response to this huge challenge<br>that we're all facing<br>uh what's emerging from the comparative<br>work that we're looking at between<br>different countries where things have<br>gone sometimes<br>quite well and sometimes not very well<br>at all<br>so far in this part of the pandemic<br>is that it's not so much to do with<br>whether they are<br>high income or low in middle-income<br>countries or low-income countries<br>it seems to be things that actually<br>sometimes don't cost a lot of money such<br>as<br>clear communication the public from<br>trusted leadership<br>consistent messages about what people<br>can and<br>can do simply to protect their health<br>and protect those around them and their<br>families workplaces etc<br>hand washing coughing into your elbow<br>physical distancing mask wearing<br>you know if you're sick don't go to work<br>if you have work<br>all of these things these don't cost a<br>lot of money now of course there are<br>costs and consequences<br>from you know shutting down lockdowns<br>and all of that which can have huge and<br>we're seeing the ramifications<br>of these and they will play out for a<br>long time to come and have health<br>consequences<br>and that's where the international<br>community i think needs to step<br>up for lower income countries to help<br>support them<br>in this time of crisis with um<br>with the technical support um for the<br>um healthcare and um<br>you know the the lab based community<br>monitoring contact tracing support and<br>expertise etc<br>but also with um keeping the economy<br>ticking over<br>and um trying to help um avoid um<br>massive inequalities and poverty and so<br>forth so i think<br>there are some things that can be done<br>that seem to be<br>low-cost but actually quite impactful<br>and this can happen even in the poorest<br>of countries<br>and so you know i think we we we're<br>going to learn a lot of lessons<br>from what's happening right now and um i<br>guess<br>hopefully in a couple of years time<br>we'll be able to look back and<br>and be much better prepared for the next<br>um which we hope won't come up on us too<br>soon but<br>it's almost inevitable so thank you very<br>much very much questions<br>yeah fantastic it's a really<br>comprehensive answer and i hope um from<br>the audience's perspective that has been<br>helpful<br>the second question we have is can we<br>talk about the facilities that we have<br>um here at the university and i think<br>we'll come back to that<br>at the end if that's okay so i'm going<br>to go down to the next question and i'm<br>going to<br>particularly ask jude to consider this<br>question jude so i'm just<br>letting you know now as our vice<br>chancellor would say jude i'm putting<br>you on notice<br>for the next question in this pandemic<br>situation<br>i'm concerned on the amend on the mental<br>health development of people<br>what should lecturers especially at the<br>university of auckland do for<br>maintaining<br>good mental health<br>um thanks for that question it's really<br>yeah i think this is right on the button<br>it's absolutely a front of mind for us<br>as lecturers<br>um one of the things that we've all<br>struggled with and this is both the<br>teaching staff at the university<br>um it's people we are coming across in<br>our community but particularly<br>our students is how is ever you know<br>it's that kind of keeping an eye on<br>on how everyone's coping so the sort of<br>things that we've been doing at auckland<br>university over this period of time i<br>mean it's<br>it's there's been kind of uh support put<br>in place for<br>students to be able to study off at home<br>or<br>in and offline away from the university<br>and to the extent that it's possible<br>that we've tried to make those resources<br>available for our students so trying to<br>kind of enable people to<br>have equitable so the same access so<br>they're not disadvantaged<br>by studying at home even by sharing a<br>household with five or six or more other<br>people so<br>that's something we've really had to<br>think about you know uh<br>there's uh some potential stresses<br>obviously<br>involved with trying to to do things<br>online and some people manage far better<br>than others so we've been really<br>thinking about ways we can preempt that<br>you know think ahead about how that<br>might be played out for people's mental<br>health<br>and then respond to that so it's it's<br>something that<br>a group of academics that other teachers<br>in our university have talked a lot<br>about and something<br>that we discuss with our students i mean<br>i'm certainly and i'm sure others in<br>this<br>panel check in with our students<br>regularly not just how they're<br>progressing with their research or their<br>assignments but actually how they're<br>managing and finding ways of<br>um supporting them in that process but<br>you know there is no simple answer to<br>this one it's just um listening and<br>responding<br>and um and keeping that in front of mine<br>because that is our job as much<br>as many other things our job as<br>lecturers and academics here<br>is to to consider student wellbeing and<br>mental well-being particularly at this<br>time is<br>absolutely critical so i think that's a<br>great question<br>thanks very much jude and just um to let<br>people know that<br>here at the university of auckland our<br>students do have access to<br>our um our counsellors through the<br>health<br>centre here at the university of<br>auckland and uh international students<br>who are here onshore with<br>insurance have access to private um<br>counselling services as well up to<br>twenty thousand dollars worth of<br>counselling sessions through their<br>insurance scheme so<br>if they are in need of support and<br>assistance during the time that they're<br>studying with us there is<br>um reasonable facilities either here on<br>campus or<br>off-site through the private facilities<br>which are funded through um<br>through the insurance scheme um some of<br>the faculties have also<br>done things like um providing study<br>buddies or peer mentors which<br>has been quite successful i think in the<br>faculty of arts and um something that<br>i think the university of auckland is<br>looking to roll out and<br>more broadly across 2021 so there is<br>additional support here for our students<br>and<br>and obviously the academics are<br>providing great support as well during<br>this challenging time<br>okay so the next question um i'm going<br>to ask<br>thomas to respond to because it's a<br>science question thomas<br>do you have any advice for high school<br>students who wish to study science at<br>the university of auckland<br>which subjects do they need to focus on<br>and any soft skills they need to prepare<br>so um thomas over to you and then if we<br>need to we'll ask nikki to respond as<br>well<br>it depends on which area of science so<br>your people will need to have<br>some background in specific uh science<br>courses so almost most people want some<br>maths background<br>and if you're interested for example in<br>you know going and studying immunology<br>with nikki<br>you probably won't have some biology um<br>background<br>uh but um the<br>so the the subjects will depend on what<br>you're studying the soft skills<br>it's important because there are some<br>important things<br>that for not that aren't sort of<br>prerequisites but are valuable<br>if you're going to be successful so<br>writing is a very important skill<br>even if you even if your native language<br>isn't english<br>being able to write well in your native<br>language is still helpful<br>for being able to write academic english<br>working with other people<br>so it can be very difficult when you're<br>working with<br>a group of other people to actually do<br>it productively so<br>one person doesn't end up doing all the<br>work or<br>even worse everybody does all the work<br>and you just duplicate effort<br>um so working with other people's<br>another important skill<br>um and real life recognizing that these<br>things are going to happen you're going<br>to<br>have to work with other people and they<br>may not be good people to work with that<br>sometimes happens you're going to have<br>to give presentations<br>where you talk to groups of people and<br>that may be scary but it's not something<br>that happens<br>so we will tr we try to provide these<br>soft skills<br>but part of it is recognizing that you<br>will have to learn them<br>fantastic and nikki do you have a an<br>additional sentence also to go with that<br>yes so i mean around the soft skills<br>definitely um<br>in line with thomas's thinking there so<br>the communication<br>communication skills are really<br>important so you know oral written<br>communication<br>being able to get up and talk to people<br>have conversations especially if you're<br>working in<br>sort of cross-disciplinary research<br>sometimes you're having conversations<br>with people that<br>have expertise that is very different<br>from you so you need to be able to<br>sometimes articulate quite complex<br>things really<br>clearly and simply to get that research<br>or work going<br>yeah fantastic thanks and there's lots<br>of great support here at the university<br>of auckland around<br>um those soft skills so creative writing<br>um<br>critical thinking courses academic<br>english all of those things and there's<br>lots and lots of support through the<br>library and learning services here at<br>auckland that can help<br>so um we do have good support services<br>here for students once you're<br>you're with us and if you're looking at<br>coming into the faculty of science to do<br>biomedical science or health science as<br>a first year student thinking about<br>medicine<br>i always suggest to students that they<br>keep their chemistry going at high<br>school because that's one thing that's<br>quite challenging to pick up if you<br>don't have a background in chemistry<br>bio we've got experts we can teach you<br>the bio but<br>keep your chemistry going if you need to<br>the next<br>question i think is equal access<br>into health resources within the<br>communities is important<br>and how and how innovation can<br>contribute to these areas<br>is there any specific projects that new<br>zealand government or university of<br>auckland<br>are working on in regards to this area<br>so judy i'm not sure if you can read<br>this question but i'm going to put it<br>back to you<br>and ask if you can respond to this<br>yeah look i think it's um i can see the<br>question and i think it's<br>it's a really important question<br>thinking about again one of the focus of<br>the work that we do is around<br>uh trying to enable equitable access so<br>making sure that people who need<br>services and resources<br>have have able to get hold of them<br>essentially so what we're learning<br>um about this is absolutely that not<br>everyone has the same access to<br>resources<br>particularly when it comes to digital<br>resources so a lot of the assumptions we<br>had in the past about<br>the digital divide or everyone being on<br>on their mobile phones isn't actually<br>the case<br>when you dig a bit deeper so one of the<br>things that um<br>we're trying to figure out is try to<br>understand about health and digital<br>literacy and particularly<br>but thinking about how innovation can<br>improve<br>health risk or access to health<br>resources i think some of the work some<br>of the things we've discovered in our<br>work is sometimes the most simple<br>innovations are the most effective<br>and most equitable so if we think about<br>um for example and chris mentioned<br>earlier about support<br>for quitting smoking i mean<br>there is a number of great resources<br>that you can<br>access for quitting tobacco use but one<br>of the things that we found to be really<br>helpful and and colleagues certainly in<br>in<br>the national institute for health<br>innovation um pioneered was<br>sending people text messages to support<br>them to quit smoking has been really<br>effective<br>so that's one of the ways but we are<br>using health innovation<br>and in a bunch of ways in terms of just<br>being<br>able to use data that we collect more<br>efficiently so we have to make greater<br>use of the data we're getting<br>to make sure we are responding to<br>populations health needs<br>um in a more timely and appropriate way<br>so<br>i think innovation and health is is just<br>burgeoning at the moment and we're only<br>seeing the beginnings of what that<br>potential is<br>with the with the focus on improving<br>health outcomes for people<br>letting people get access to those tools<br>and and potential<br>um it's heading in the right direction<br>fantastic and<br>the ministry of foreign affairs and<br>trade here and or in new zealand<br>are providing some funding for projects<br>and for research for students<br>to come to new zealand or potentially<br>commence offshore<br>if that if they can't get here for 2021<br>so um there is some support through the<br>new zealand government um<br>scholarship scheme called new zealand<br>scholarships so check that out if you're<br>interested<br>in development scholarships through our<br>website<br>okay the next question we have and i'm<br>just mindful of the time now we've only<br>got a couple of minutes to go<br>um so the next questions are both kind<br>of related they're about university of<br>auckland<br>so the first one is can we talk about<br>information on what facilities we have<br>at the university of auckland<br>in health and science and the second one<br>is because of the current pandemic there<br>must be some learning activities<br>that cannot be done how are we handling<br>this<br>what are the things what things are<br>being done to keep learning activities<br>effective<br>particularly in health and um and<br>science<br>and so i i wonder chris if you're aware<br>of the work that's being done at fmhs<br>the faculty of medical and health<br>sciences around<br>online delivery for students who can't<br>get into campus<br>um of course our students are here on<br>campus at the moment but we do have some<br>students who are studying<br>um offshore and uh online<br>yes so um as you say karen um we're very<br>fortunate to<br>to be back meeting together again on<br>campus<br>um but for a couple of months uh we've<br>had<br>uh online delivery in effect i was<br>really proud of<br>uh our university's ability um<br>to s to pivot using that that word<br>um from um our normal delivery of our<br>teaching<br>and within the space of a week to move<br>to fully online in order to be able to<br>support our students<br>and that was just a fantastic effort and<br>i know it's been greatly appreciated<br>by the students it's not perfect and um<br>it's been difficult and challenging<br>but we were able to do that because we<br>had the infrastructure and the technical<br>know-how in place and the willingness um<br>and you know encouraged to to try that<br>and the student body were brought on<br>board and supported that<br>and that's actually been really um a<br>useful<br>experience in some ways although you<br>know it's been hard<br>for both students and staff we've<br>learned<br>some new things through that experience<br>which i think will maybe strengthen<br>some of the the ways in which we<br>deliver some of our courses going<br>forward<br>but of course the hands-on clinical<br>lab-based<br>programs that's been much harder we have<br>those kind of practical hands-on skills<br>and so forth<br>haven't been easily able to be<br>substituted in the sort of digital way<br>though there's been some really creative<br>things done to<br>um make the best of it for students and<br>i know that's been<br>hugely appreciated and perhaps nikki<br>from a biomedical<br>perspective could speak to some of that<br>side of things um<br>but from my my side of it um<br>we've you know we've really worked hard<br>to deliver<br>first-rate programs and support our<br>students<br>by going fully digital and it's been<br>very successful<br>um nikki would you like just a quick<br>comment about what's happening<br>with teaching online in your space yeah<br>i mean<br>obviously a component of studying<br>biomedical science is the practical<br>laboratory aspects and we are very<br>fortunate at the moment that our<br>teaching labs<br>will have been open and so it's been<br>great to see the students<br>back in the labs with pipettes and<br>doing all the things that they should be<br>doing in the lab when the lockdowns<br>happened and we weren't<br>able to get students into the lab we<br>did<br>instead film um<br>film teaching labs um and then we're<br>able to sort of chunk those up into<br>small practical exercises<br>um and so whilst um it's definitely not<br>making up for students getting that<br>practical experience in the lab we tried<br>to make those sessions as<br>interactive um with small quizzes and<br>you know really<br>you know it was real life filming in the<br>lab we were doing these things<br>um and yeah there's i think lots of<br>opportunities to learn from that<br>and use some of those digital tools<br>going forward as well<br>fan fantastic thanks very much nikki um<br>here at the international office we<br>um are working with our international<br>students who are<br>who have office of place or interested<br>in coming to us here at the university<br>of auckland<br>um to start online and come on campus<br>when they're able to do so<br>and there's a glorious maori expression<br>and i'm hoping i'm going to pronounce<br>this correctly but it's hai waka<br>and noah which is we're all in this<br>together<br>and so we're here to support our<br>students and do everything we can<br>to assist you to commence online if<br>you're not able to be with us and<br>in fact i'm working very very closely<br>with the head of the medical program to<br>allow our own overseas students to start<br>year two medicine offshore<br>online which is quite an extraordinary<br>thing so we're working really really<br>hard to develop<br>as much content as we possibly can and<br>it's not just about delivering<br>a a recorded lecture there's a lot more<br>to<br>what we deliver um to our online<br>students<br>um we do have a list of courses that are<br>not available to be delivered online as<br>nikki<br>says some things are really really<br>clinically focused and you need the<br>patience in front of you<br>some things like dance need a studio<br>space and not able to be delivered so we<br>do have a list of courses that are not<br>available online<br>on our website and we'll be in touch<br>with our existing students<br>um and uh offer holders to let them know<br>exactly what they can expect for<br>semester one and beyond for 2021<br>and that leads us really nicely to um a<br>little wrap<br>up um we greatly appreciate the<br>questions we've received from you we<br>think we've answered them all<br>um you did ask about facilities on<br>campus uh at usual times<br>and um we're going to show you some<br>information with um<br>some some links on the next slide<br>this uh webinar is being recorded and<br>you'll be able to go back to it at<br>any time it will be on our youtube site<br>and there'll be a link to the<br>um to the website from that we've got<br>some fantastic images on uh<br>university of auckland website around<br>the facilities at both fmhs and the<br>medical school<br>um the faculty of medical and health<br>sciences and the science faculty where<br>you'll be able to have a little look at<br>the facilities and the types of<br>of stuff we have on site and so um just<br>like to<br>um say thank you very much to the<br>audience for for joining us this<br>afternoon for this really interesting<br>conversation about what<br>our faculties of medical and health<br>sciences and science are doing both<br>around the sdgs<br>and around our um our global impact in<br>general<br>um there's some great links here have a<br>look at our twitter feed or facebook if<br>you use it or linkedin<br>we've got a fantastic sustainability at<br>auckland web page which you might be<br>interested in and there's a um the qr<br>code there if you're interested<br>um i'd just like to wrap up by saying a<br>huge thank you to the panelists<br>to um to jin
