accurate.</p><p>welcome everybody<br>to the melting ice and rising sea panel<br>discussion<br>my name is professor grant guilford i'm<br>vice chancellor of tayyip<br>victoria university of wellington and<br>it's my honor to welcome you all to this<br>event<br>tonight you'll be hearing from a group<br>of six award-winning<br>wellington university researchers these<br>researchers are part of a wider team of<br>20<br>geologists glaciologists climate and<br>social scientists<br>from the university science in the<br>national institute of water and<br>atmospheric research<br>known as the melting ice and rising seas<br>team<br>they are behind the breakthrough<br>discovery the antarctica's ice sheets<br>melted rapidly in the past and could<br>have<br>a significant impact on global sea level<br>rise<br>over the next 80 years including causing<br>sea level<br>to rise by as much as 2 meters in some<br>parts of new zealand<br>the workers involved annual expeditions<br>to antarctica over the past 15 years<br>to collect ice and sediment samples that<br>provide an<br>understanding of how the frozen<br>continent responded to past changes in<br>the earth's climate<br>they have used these insights from past<br>warm climates<br>to test and improve computer simulations<br>of how the polar ice sheets<br>melt and how they contribute to global<br>sea level rise<br>with the evidence they have connected<br>the team is communicating with decision<br>makers<br>on how to avoid the worst impacts of<br>modern climate change<br>including identifying limits for the<br>melting of antarctica<br>and avoiding damaging global sea level<br>rise through controlling<br>human produced greenhouse gas emissions<br>with this evidence the team is also<br>improving projections<br>of sea level rise for new zealand so the<br>decision makers<br>and the public are better prepared for<br>managing and adapting to<br>rising seas and their coastal impacts<br>with their work the team recently<br>received the prestigious prime<br>minister's science prize<br>this prize is awarded every year for a<br>transformative<br>scientific discovery or achievement has<br>had significant<br>economic health social or environmental<br>impact on new zealand<br>or the wider world the prize is worth<br>five hundred thousand dollars<br>which in this case will support further<br>work by the mounting ice<br>and rising seas team including an<br>enduring phd scholarship<br>for studying antarctic ice sheet<br>dynamics and the implications for sea<br>level rise in new zealand<br>tonight you will hear these modern day<br>explorers speak about the work that led<br>to the prime minister's science prize<br>from field work to scientific modeling<br>to communicating their findings<br>and working with local local<br>stakeholders to help new zealand and the<br>world<br>manage and adapt to sea level rise<br>this work is a wonderful example of the<br>multi-disciplinary expertise we have<br>here at the university and<br>in our wider capital city with this<br>combined team<br>of science policy and communication<br>experts<br>these researchers were able to take this<br>work from fundamental discovery<br>all the way through to science and<br>policy ready to be applied to the modern<br>world<br>together they have made a significant<br>contribution to the university's role<br>as a global civic university and along<br>the way<br>they have made us very very proud<br>the nice decision that's our discussion<br>will be led by<br>the individual professor tim nash from<br>the antarctic research center<br>team leader of the melting ice and<br>rising seas<br>team please now join me in welcoming the<br>welcome everyone and and thanks grant um<br>for that nice introduction it's actually<br>i don't really need to say too much<br>after that<br>you've made my job quite easy um thanks<br>kylie and your team<br>for organising this public event where<br>we can share<br>with you the research and some of the<br>impacts<br>that have come from that research that<br>have won the prime minister's science<br>prize<br>so as grant said i'm tim nash i'm going<br>to emcee things tonight<br>i'm going to introduce you to the<br>star-studded lineup here<br>which are members of the team obviously<br>the team was a lot a lot bigger<br>and in a moment i'll tell you how we'll<br>do things and you'll have the<br>opportunity<br>to um ask questions so<br>think of questions as as we're speaking<br>and i'm sure we'll have a lively<br>discussion<br>at the end um but first i want to<br>acknowledge<br>the prize and sort of what it means to<br>us i mean this has been a massive thrill<br>and and actually one of the my worst<br>kept secrets and probably one of the<br>one of our worst kept secrets um just<br>just because of<br>um you know the impacts of of covert<br>um 19 and you'll cons you can see that<br>it says<br>2019 science prize and andrew clennan<br>the ceo of the<br>royal society rang me up in 2019<br>and and said well done you've won this<br>and then of course covert came in and we<br>had to<br>well things got delayed and we<br>eventually received the<br>prize virtually in an online ceremony<br>just just very recently<br>actually so it's very new to us we're<br>still we're still really excited<br>um we're a little disappointed and<br>particularly our partners<br>and families are disappointed because we<br>didn't get to meet the prime minister in<br>the actual ceremony<br>so i'm assured by the royal society<br>we'll get invited to next year's awards<br>and that'll happen then<br>um i'm not sure if juliette girard is<br>here she was certainly on the in<br>hey julia you're at the back she was on<br>the invitation list so it's great to<br>have you<br>here at least julia and yep<br>i've singled you out okay<br>and i also want to add that this is<br>truly a team prize with a capital<br>t it represents many people's work over<br>many<br>years actually you know almost 40 years<br>to build the foundations<br>and that's people like fred davey peter<br>barrett lionel carter<br>and then with peter and alex pine<br>developing that pioneering drilling<br>technology<br>that's allowed us to make these<br>discoveries um<br>in antarctica and you know peter<br>couldn't be here tonight unfortunately<br>but<br>he's been talking about um ice sheets<br>collapsing sea level rising global<br>warming<br>for more than 40 years well before you<br>know global climate change became a<br>household sort of<br>so we had to cut the team down<br>for this from the 23 people and what<br>we've done is we've chosen<br>a a selection of the team<br>to take you on a journey<br>a journey of that that really spans<br>the spans what we do<br>from the very fundamental discovery led<br>curiosity driven<br>side of things you go to antarctica and<br>you discover cool things<br>to realizing they actually have global<br>significance<br>to then realizing that there's this<br>ongoing concern<br>and growing concern about climate change<br>and what's happening to the<br>antarctic ice sheet and and realizing<br>that your research has really important<br>specific benefits and impacts for new<br>zealand<br>so as we go through the the team and<br>where each person talks and in a moment<br>i'll introduce each of them i'll let<br>them talk<br>and then when they've all spoken you'll<br>have been on a journey<br>on a story line that takes you from<br>fundamental discovery through to where<br>the rubber hits the road<br>and why this sort of research<br>matters<br>i did want to also acknowledge that you<br>can't do this sort of science on your<br>own<br>no one institution can do it and there's<br>a lot of logos<br>around from the institutions who did the<br>science and particularly want to<br>comment and and acknowledge the role of<br>um and the deep relationship we've had<br>with with gns and niwa over the years<br>and and could in the collaboration<br>that's ongoing<br>with the um antarctic science platform<br>national modeling hub<br>and the ice core research facility so<br>those remain really important and<br>and deep collaborations which were part<br>of this prize and<br>the sort of research we're doing from<br>from fundamental science all the way<br>through to the applied end<br>can't be funded by out of any one<br>program and so that's why you see so<br>many different<br>organizations and funding agencies that<br>have contributed<br>to to that funding and i must<br>acknowledge students so our team of 23<br>a largely antarctic research center and<br>the<br>center for science and society the<br>climate change research institute and<br>then our<br>but students students are the engine in<br>this so postgraduate students<br>and and graduate students have have<br>really been the engine room that's<br>generated<br>okay so let's get underway<br>um there we are that's the full full<br>extent of us<br>and and interestingly just just to point<br>out there are scientists in there<br>um but there are also support staff and<br>and<br>you know it's the support staff it's the<br>clever engineers and technical people<br>and and even people who just do the<br>administration and the management<br>um that are possibly more important than<br>the scientists<br>so you know it's really great to see<br>them acknowledged as well<br>okay so i'm now going to introduce<br>our um first speaker<br>they're each going to talk for about six<br>or seven minutes and then so they'll<br>come up here and then they'll sit back<br>down again<br>and um and then we'll have the next<br>speaker and we'll save the questions<br>until the end so the first speaker<br>is rob mckay he is the current director<br>of the antarctic research center<br>rob uses geological drill calls around<br>antarctica to understand how ice sheets<br>respond in the past<br>to to climate change and particularly<br>warmer climates than we have today in<br>the sort of world we're going into<br>rob led the 20 million international<br>ocean drilling expedition<br>to the ross sea in 2018<br>um he received the prime minister's<br>emerging science prize in 2010<br>for his phd research um<br>which which i supervised um<br>and um so rob sort of holds it over me<br>now he has two<br>prime minister science prizes um so rob<br>will take us back to<br>where it all began with some of those<br>fundamental discoveries about what we<br>learned about west antarctica rob<br>thank you tim so i'm going to keep it<br>pretty simple in terms of how we go<br>through these few slides and just<br>ask a couple of really fundamental<br>questions and the first one being when<br>did that ice sheet last collapse<br>and the next one being how warm it was<br>when that collapsed<br>and ultimately getting to the sea level<br>question of how high was sea level<br>so there's certain things we can do with<br>past climates and there's certain things<br>we can't do and so having to marry that<br>up with people that work<br>on human time scales policy relevant<br>time scales is one of our challenges and<br>that's really where this group has has<br>excelled<br>and so within victoria and wellington in<br>general we have quite a large<br>group of people working on the ipcc the<br>intergovernmental panel and climate<br>change<br>and this picture here is a model<br>projection<br>under the worst case scenario in the<br>last ipcc assessment report so this is<br>um<br>the concentration pathway 8.5<br>and which is extreme it's looking at<br>about a warming of just under 4 degrees<br>celsius globally by the end of the<br>century<br>important to remember that it's<br>operating over 100 year time scale<br>and it's going to keep going so that's<br>actually a snapshot 100 years in the<br>future well<br>less than 100 years in the future but<br>the planet takes a long time to to<br>actually reach up with that foreseen of<br>increased greenhouse gases in the<br>atmosphere on geological time scales<br>we can compare this to climates 3<br>million years ago<br>so we recently passed 400 parts a<br>million co2 in the atmosphere<br>and this is what it looks like when the<br>planet catches up with that level of co2<br>in the atmosphere and you can see<br>it's actually moderately cooler than<br>what we saw in that that previous<br>projection in 100 years time<br>or 20 2100 so here we're looking about<br>two to three degrees globally warmer so<br>this is<br>just exceeding the paris targets so two<br>degree warmer climate<br>the background colors there is the model<br>run and the dots<br>are the geological data so you can see<br>here this these places where those dots<br>the color scales are the same for<br>temperature change<br>they match up pretty well and there's<br>places where they don't the data<br>actually appears to be a little bit<br>warmer than some of these models<br>so another thing we look at is how well<br>do these these past climates compare<br>with model performance and it helps to<br>refine those models<br>one feature we notice in these models is<br>that the polar regions warm up more<br>than the rest of the globe they<br>approximately double the rest of the<br>globe and so the question then becomes<br>okay are two degrees global warming<br>what's that happening in the waters<br>offshore of antarctica and does that<br>cause an ice sheet retreat<br>so when tim and the arc people like alex<br>pine developed the andrew project<br>the question was when did that ice sheet<br>last retreat and we didn't know that<br>answer we thought it might have been<br>stable for 14 million years it might be<br>stable at 400 parts per million<br>co2<br>so this is what the ice sheet looks like<br>today you can see<br>here big ice shelves these act to<br>protect<br>the flow of ice into the ocean and<br>actually slow down the flow of ice<br>so you remove those ice shelves the ice<br>sheet behind it<br>disappears and particularly the parts<br>sorry the animations are not working<br>here<br>this here is a marine based sector of<br>the eye sheet so this means the ice<br>sheets sitting on the earth's surface<br>below several it's intimately connected<br>to<br>the oceans and you don't need a lot of<br>change in the amount of<br>temperature in the oceans with the<br>amount of heat being pushed next to that<br>ice sheet to initiate a retreat<br>and as the retreat gets initiated it<br>goes into a deeper<br>setting further inland that you go on<br>west antarctica so this is what's known<br>as marine ice sheet instability<br>once that retreat off this little<br>topographic high begins<br>it becomes runaway and it accelerates<br>and so the question is<br>here where's antarctica we've got about<br>three and a half metres of sea level<br>that's susceptible to marine based ice<br>sheet instability<br>in an east antarctica about just under<br>20 metres so how much of that goes<br>in this moderately warmer climate of two<br>and so we do quite a simple thing you<br>know sedimentology is<br>it's um it's a first order observation<br>was there an ice sheet there and we just<br>look at what type of sediments we pulled<br>out of the drill pool so we drilled<br>through the ross ice shelf<br>with the hot water drill system we load<br>a pipe to the sea floor and we collected<br>over a kilometer of sediment<br>and the further down you go the further<br>back in time you go because the<br>sediments stack up through time<br>so we saw these natural ice age cycles<br>times when there were bigger ice sheets<br>than today<br>carries gravel sand muds i see ice<br>sheets don't care what they pick up<br>they're like a bulldozer<br>as that ice sheet retreats and you get a<br>nice shelf very weak ocean currents wash<br>muds in<br>occasionally a pebble will fall out of<br>that floating ice above the the site<br>and you get these these muds with with<br>gravel and i actually have the core<br>down here um just showing these these<br>color changes you can just look at the<br>color changes<br>open water conditions above the drill<br>site what's recorded are plankton living<br>in the ocean surface<br>will settle to the sea floor and form<br>what's called a diatomos<br>these are shells of marine plankton<br>indicating their open waters above the<br>site so<br>we mapped the core we met where these<br>sediments occur in the core<br>and we compare it to at the time quite<br>revolutionary ice sheet models that<br>could first capture this<br>this relationship between ice shelf<br>collapse and the loss of that grounded<br>ice sheet behind it the ice that<br>contributes to sea level rise<br>so we'll color coat it there the yellows<br>being<br>open water conditions above the drill<br>site<br>oh okay microsoft fail um so the yellows<br>doesn't really matter too much here the<br>the goblet of<br>this is three and a half million years<br>ago this is two million years ago and so<br>you can see that you've got this time<br>sequence<br>getting into this this sweet spot of the<br>pricing time period<br>two to three degrees warmer we were<br>seeing fossil species<br>that today live north of the polar front<br>they live in waters that are completely<br>intolerant to sea ice<br>so we had three to four degrees of<br>warmer temperatures in the ross sea<br>during those peak plus and warm periods<br>so 400 parts a million<br>matches that relationship of double the<br>warming in the polar regions<br>compared to the global average but<br>even in the more recent record up to a<br>million years ago we're still seeing<br>these collapse events<br>and this is occurring when there is sea<br>ice in the ross sea fossil species that<br>are about one to two degrees warmer<br>waters<br>we could look at chemical compounds and<br>also trace some chemical tracings for<br>those temperatures that they came out<br>those same temperatures<br>so it doesn't take a lot of oceanic<br>warming to initiate that loss of those<br>ice shelves<br>and with it the ice sheet behind it so<br>that was almost 10 years ago we did the<br>andrew project and we came up with these<br>numbers<br>the models were catching up with us at<br>that point they couldn't lose this<br>amount of ice without<br>having to put extra physics into their<br>models and so<br>what we are at now is looking towards<br>the east antarctic ice sheet<br>so after angela i was involved in an<br>iodp expedition<br>off the coast of wilkesland here and<br>this is a model run by nick<br>gollage for the placing where he was<br>using this<br>geological data to constrain how much<br>ice loss he would be able to<br>tune in as models to get out of his<br>models and in these pricing climates<br>we're looking at sea levels<br>exceeding 10 meters above the present<br>day potentially up to 20 metres from<br>some other geological archives around<br>the world including<br>in new zealand we've recently called in<br>the wanganui basin<br>showing that eastern tattoo is highly<br>sensitive to these warmer climates<br>potentially large parts of that larger<br>east antarctic ice sheet<br>so that's where we're heading to in the<br>future we're looking towards that<br>sleeping giant of the<br>the ice sheet that we thought 10 years<br>ago before andrew<br>was stable and pretty insensitive to<br>change<br>what we can't get to with these<br>geological records so i've got to<br>magnitude<br>we got to how warm it was we can talk<br>about magnitude of temperature magnitude<br>of ice loss<br>but we are dealing with time scales of<br>thousands of years in these geological<br>archives<br>how do we get to what is relevant in 100<br>year time scales and so that's where<br>we're going to look at some of the more<br>recent ich<br>cycles and then also how we can use<br>models to inform on that rates of change<br>because that's the key thing that's<br>rob i apologize i did not booby trap<br>your slide<br>it was perfect on my screen so i don't<br>quite know what happened but<br>scary stuff right 400 ppm<br>the concentration of carbon dioxide<br>we've got in the atmosphere now<br>the west antarctic ice sheet goes away<br>in some of the east antarctic ice sheet<br>that was the first<br>time we got quite quite concerned<br>okay so it gives me great pleasure to<br>introduce our next speaker which is<br>nancy burtler<br>and nancy holds at least three jobs i'm<br>aware of<br>and there could be others um she is<br>director of the antarctic re<br>uh the antarctic science platform uh<br>hosted by antarctica new zealand she's<br>associate professor<br>in the antarctic research center and she<br>runs the new zealand<br>ice core research facility where she is<br>a principal scientist at gns<br>science nancy was awarded the blake<br>leadership medal i think in 2017 or my<br>memory might be fading me and this was<br>for her outstanding development and<br>leadership of ice core research<br>in new zealand tonight she will show us<br>what ice cores can tell us<br>about global warming and how fast sea<br>levels can rise<br>nancy<br>yeah thank you very much as rob just<br>mentioned<br>you know we look at the geological<br>records to find out how much sea level<br>we anticipate when the climate<br>stabilizes<br>but the other key question is really how<br>quickly we see sea level<br>rates change on time scales that matter<br>to us<br>and policy makers and this is where the<br>complementary work between<br>these deep marine sediment records and<br>other archives with ice core records<br>provide us some<br>real unique opportunities<br>so one of the studies that we can use in<br>that measurement a little bit odd to you<br>is actually looking at the last ice age<br>and just looking at from the last ice<br>age<br>how quickly these ice sheets lost mass<br>and sea level<br>increased as as consequence of that<br>so during the ice ages global<br>temperatures was about six degrees<br>colder<br>and as these ice sheets melted coming to<br>today's conditions<br>sea levels rose by 120 meters of course<br>a lot of these ice sheets are gone now<br>so we're not expecting quite as much to<br>remain um to melt um but this is an area<br>where we can<br>really look at rates how quickly can the<br>ice sheets change<br>so in front of you is a very boring<br>graph that shows the last 22 000 years<br>and i'm just showing you now how from<br>the last ice age to today<br>sea level changed so we're starting off<br>below zero and zero is today's sea level<br>so here is the last ice age we still had<br>mammoos<br>running running roaming the northern<br>hemispheres<br>and then it got warmer so here is the<br>sea level rise<br>and i can talk for hours about this very<br>simple graph to undergraduate classes<br>but here we keep it short and one of the<br>really key things is that for the last<br>10<br>000 years in our graph sea level didn't<br>change very much right<br>we as societies are really used to very<br>stable conditions another really<br>interesting part of that is if you think<br>that over this time period we lost we<br>increased sea level by 120 meters<br>that makes about a meter per hundred<br>years so it's quite fast but of course<br>we had these large<br>large ice sheets that melted away but<br>then it's not a linear graph<br>we have these odd blips in there and<br>scientists aren't very creative people<br>we need other folks to help us with that<br>we call these things melt water pulse 1a<br>couldn't come up with something better<br>but during this melt with the pulse 1a<br>rates change for 500 years to 4 meters<br>of sea level rise every 100 years<br>and if there's policy makers in the<br>audience that should really scare the<br>heck out of you because that would be a<br>massive message challenge<br>for a long time we didn't think that was<br>policy relevant because we thought it<br>would come from the northern hemispheric<br>ice sheets that no longer exists<br>but then nick college about four or five<br>years ago and also a group of germany<br>independently<br>identified this mouth pulse as actually<br>having a very large contribution from<br>antarctica<br>and that made us sit up because suddenly<br>antarctica is still here<br>this is suddenly policy relevant if we<br>have<br>if we can have faster rates we need to<br>know about them<br>so this is where ice cores can be very<br>very useful ice cores a little bit like<br>tree rings can<br>collect very nicely continuous records<br>over time and that allows us to look at<br>fast things that happen over just a few<br>years<br>you see this beautiful image there from<br>a snow pit<br>and about 20 centimeter chunks of those<br>are annual layers so we can drill back<br>in time hundreds of thousands of years<br>and for the last tens of thousands of<br>years we will actually have seasonal<br>resolution we can look at summers<br>12 000 years ago but also ice cores have<br>this violent<br>nice ability as the snow compresses<br>under the white of the new snow<br>it slowly forms ice and when it forms<br>ice it creates bubbles and at that time<br>it captures<br>greenhouse gases it captures all gases<br>but also the greenhouse gases<br>and so while ice course can tell us a<br>lot about temperature<br>of the globe and it can tell us from the<br>chemistry what the oceans and other<br>aspects of the of the earth system have<br>done it also can give us a direct record<br>of past greenhouse gases<br>i also just wanted to show you a picture<br>of the last ice core program that we ran<br>out of new zealand it was a nine nation<br>project we were very proud<br>to do this but the only reason we could<br>do this was because of our engineering<br>team<br>this is a drill um there's only two such<br>drills that exists in the world<br>and our engineering team for them that<br>was just a side project because normally<br>they are<br>dealing with even more complicated<br>drilling in the oceans<br>but they not only modified this drill to<br>have additional capability and deliver<br>us this beautiful drill<br>ice core but also the engineering that<br>went into the national high school<br>facility at gns allowed us to do things<br>that weren't possible<br>elsewhere before then and so it's really<br>the engineering<br>that is one of our secret sort of<br>weapons that allows us to do things<br>that gives us a real advantage and so it<br>allows us to develop new technology to<br>support our science<br>but then what did these records tell us<br>this is a most<br>iconic record from fostoc which shows us<br>the last four hundred thousand years<br>at the bottom you see four hundred<br>thousand years where we get the<br>temperature from the ice core record<br>and then from these tiny bubbles we can<br>extract co2 and methane<br>data and as you can maybe see we go<br>through these warm periods and slowly<br>cool into an ice agent and we go into a<br>warm period and go back into an ice age<br>and we do this about four times in the<br>last four hundred thousand years<br>if you compare the temperature with the<br>greenhouse gases you can sort of see for<br>all tens and purposes that they look the<br>same<br>which really was sort of first<br>indication that greenhouse gases<br>drive global temperature at a very<br>sensitive rate<br>but to zoom in now into the into today's<br>time we go from zero to 2000<br>and the time frame changes so now we<br>just look at hundreds of years<br>and you can none of that will be news to<br>you we have the huge increase in<br>greenhouse gases<br>with a smaller increase in temperature<br>and we of course were interested why the<br>increase in temperature didn't match<br>the temperature increase in the past and<br>we know now that 93<br>of the heat produced by the greenhouse<br>gases that are now in the atmosphere<br>absorbed by the ocean<br>which slowed down the atmospheric<br>temperature i'm going to show you a<br>really<br>busy graph and it's the last graph right<br>now but i only want to show you<br>why we actually now had to have to hand<br>over to the modeling community so this<br>is the records from antarctica in<br>greenland they're color-coded greenland<br>is purple<br>then we have beautiful records from east<br>antarctic and green some from the<br>russian blue<br>in west antarctica and red and what i<br>want to take what i want you to take<br>away from this is that there's very<br>abrupt changes we see<br>huge climatic swings about that i've<br>started in less than five years and then<br>sometimes lasted for 500 years so we<br>we know the climate system is really<br>capable of very very fast changes<br>but to make sense of these wiggly mess<br>we actually need help and we need help<br>with models that put that into<br>perspective of representation<br>around the entire globe rather than<br>single spots and also to test<br>processes and thresholds and so this is<br>where really the collaboration with<br>the next speaker is helping us to make<br>sense of those data as well as allowing<br>us to verify the quality of the records<br>by trying to<br>reconstruct what we see in the data<br>um great thank you nancy so now we know<br>ice sheets are pretty sensitive and go<br>away and and they can go away really<br>quickly and sea level can rise<br>really fast like um four meters per<br>century but<br>how fast can antarctica melt i think<br>we're about to find out<br>um so within a team<br>of very impressive scientists nick<br>gollage stands out<br>um his head is big enough as you can see<br>up there<br>um so i won't say any more<br>he is associate professor i will say<br>some more he is associate professor in<br>the antarctic research center and<br>and leader of the antarctic science<br>platform national modeling hub<br>he's also a leader in the uh when he's a<br>lead author<br>on the ipcc's current assessment report<br>he's a new numerical ice sheet modeler<br>and his group<br>his research group is really leading the<br>world with their modelling<br>of understanding the antarctic ice sheet<br>how it melts and how it contributes to<br>sea level rise<br>he has this incredible record i'm going<br>to embarrass him with<br>um he has published six papers<br>in the world's most prestigious<br>scientific journal nature in the last<br>six years<br>that's one a year so no pressure nick<br>the next one can't be too far away all<br>right<br>so i better let you do some talking so<br>okay thanks tim<br>no pressure um okay let's get into the<br>science<br>okay so i run uh computer simulations<br>basically so i try and<br>understand how the ice sheet behaves<br>by having a very small representation of<br>it on my computer screen and then<br>i try and disturb it try and upset it<br>and see<br>see what it does but one of the<br>important things about any kind of<br>modeling process is having some<br>constraint for those experiments and the<br>kind of work that nancy and rob<br>have described in the last two um<br>the two talks is really fundamental so<br>getting those geological records getting<br>the ice core records<br>those are the things that tell us how<br>the environment has changed and how the<br>ice sheet has changed in the past<br>and that's what we use as our targets<br>when we're running these simulations of<br>the past<br>so what i'm showing here on this graph<br>is on the top panel there in the green<br>color that's a sediment record<br>the kind of thing that rob would get<br>from uh you know the sediment cores that<br>he's drilling<br>this is actually from the german group<br>that nancy mentioned<br>but the reason i'm showing it is because<br>they drilled this sediment<br>core from the weddell sea um we tend to<br>work in the ross sea<br>they recovered this this record and<br>basically the height of the bars there<br>tells you some indication of the<br>relative<br>magnitude of change of the ice sheets<br>during that last de-glacial period that<br>nancy mentioned<br>so basically what we can see is these<br>rapid changes this is spanning<br>uh sort of 10 000 years there and but<br>you can see that the the ice sheet isn't<br>just losing mass<br>smoothly it's what nancy's talked about<br>these there are these abrupt melt water<br>pulses<br>times when the ice sheet responds very<br>very quickly and we lose a lot of that<br>ice into the ocean<br>now we were running computer models um<br>constrained by different data<br>um at this time and<br>as it turned out we managed to get an<br>amazingly<br>i think an amazingly good fit to that<br>sediment record<br>and and the the reason that we got that<br>fit was because we<br>managed to incorporate into the model<br>the processes that<br>allow the ice sheet to behave<br>dynamically and this gives us a<br>really good first order check that the<br>models are doing the right kind of thing<br>you can kind of think about it like um<br>i don't know like shooting a soccer ball<br>through uh goal posts<br>if you've got one goal post in front of<br>you it's pretty easy to kick a ball<br>through that<br>but if you've got a whole stack of those<br>goal posts one behind another they're<br>all slightly different sizes<br>you've got to get things just right to<br>go right through the middle so that's<br>kind of what we're doing with these<br>these constraints that we use on the<br>models<br>now the reason that we do that of course<br>is we want to use these models we want a<br>bit of<br>basically trust the models when we do<br>the future projections<br>so what we're trying to do is get those<br>models behaving correctly or<br>what we think is correctly based on the<br>the paleo data the geological records<br>and then we say right we've got the<br>physics that we need we've got the<br>behavior that looks like<br>what we've seen in the past let's just<br>change the climate forcing we put in<br>there we'll put in a future<br>forcing some of the rcp scenarios that<br>we've heard about<br>and see what the ice sheet does<br>now the the curious thing about ice<br>sheets is that we've got a real time<br>scale issue<br>when we look at the response of an ice<br>sheet over maybe<br>a year to a decade it it doesn't really<br>do a whole lot to be honest<br>it melts a small amount when you warm<br>the air or you warm the ocean it melts a<br>small amount but what really<br>really matters is what happens after<br>that when we start looking at decades to<br>centuries<br>that's when we start to see what we call<br>the dynamic response and this is what<br>rob was talking about earlier that<br>marine ice sheet instability<br>we start seeing thinning and<br>acceleration of the ice sheet<br>as it flows into the ocean now the key<br>thing here is that if we've got our<br>model<br>tuned correctly we can tell when that<br>dynamic contribution will kick in and<br>the kind of<br>um environment the environmental<br>conditions under which<br>those changes might take place and it<br>turns out that when we run these<br>experiments with different levels of<br>climatic forcing we can see that there's<br>a separation in that trajectory of<br>change and it seems to be around about<br>the two to three degree<br>mark so kind of uh kind of critical<br>that's sort of above<br>um sort of early industrial levels so<br>pretty much around the paris agreement<br>uh kind of limit<br>now of course when we go beyond that<br>time frame<br>we're seeing that ongoing loss and this<br>is something we think about in terms of<br>the commitment this is something that<br>the change is going to happen<br>way beyond our lifetimes probably beyond<br>the lifetimes of our children<br>maybe even our grandchildren but we're<br>setting in place changes<br>now that will play out over hundreds<br>and thousands of years it's very very<br>hard to stop that ice sheet going<br>once it's gone so actually finding out<br>right now<br>which line we're going to follow is<br>pretty important and we can pretty much<br>narrow it down to staying below about<br>two degrees<br>so that in a thousand years time we've<br>only lost a small amount of the ice<br>sheet rather than<br>something like 10 meters<br>now of course one model is is never<br>going to be reliable<br>and we can always find problems with<br>anything that we look at so a large part<br>of what we do in this group<br>is we contribute to these big<br>international collaborations<br>the the projects where we're bringing<br>together ice sheet modelers<br>from all over the world using very<br>different models using different<br>approaches even if they're using the<br>same model<br>and the idea here is that the more we<br>pull these models uh together from<br>different groups the more we can see<br>where they're similar and where they're<br>different<br>and the key thing about antarctica as<br>you can see there on the on the left<br>hand side<br>greenland is that sort of quite narrow<br>greenland green coloured spike<br>basically the behavior of greenland is<br>quite quite well understood it tends to<br>melt as the air gets warmer but it<br>doesn't respond too much to the ocean<br>antarctica is the wild card it's a much<br>bigger spread there that blue<br>uh that blue um polygon whatever it is<br>bell um and that's because of this<br>dynamic contribution that we<br>we don't really uh fully capture we<br>don't really understand in the models<br>too well<br>so there's still a lot of work to do<br>there and that's why we need these into<br>comparisons but the thing that's clear<br>is that basically if we<br>follow a high emissions scenario we will<br>see<br>much higher mass loss from antarctica if<br>we follow a mitigated scenario<br>we'll see much less mass loss now the<br>key thing the key message to take away<br>from these into comparisons is that<br>people<br>sort of tend to focus on that the range<br>that you get and say well the models<br>disagree<br>there's uncertainty but you've got to<br>remember that for every model member you<br>add to that ensemble<br>the stronger your central tendency<br>becomes so that median line in the dark<br>color<br>becomes more certain with every model<br>you add so even if the uncertainty<br>increases<br>you're more sure about the middle<br>and that's a key thing when it comes to<br>deciding on policy decisions<br>and i'll leave it there thank you<br>great thanks very much nick um and that<br>really was a massive<br>discovery i think that well i know that<br>um<br>nick was the first to really identify<br>that that two degrees could be a tipping<br>point<br>for the antarctic ice sheet system<br>okay whose turn is it now richard levy<br>it now gives me great pleasure to<br>introduce richard richard is a<br>researcher is the research leader of the<br>climate and environment theme at gns<br>science<br>where he too is a principal scientist he<br>is also an associate professor in the<br>antarctic research center<br>he developed and currently leads the new<br>zealand sea rise program<br>which is improving location specific<br>projections of sea level rise<br>and he will be talking about that<br>tonight richard is one of these<br>remarkable people he's a jack of all<br>trades a master of<br>many and his<br>his skill set spans paleoclimate science<br>sea level projections<br>and impacts science communication and<br>engagement<br>so richard will explain to us how we<br>predict<br>sea level rise using these models that<br>nick has talked about and what that<br>good evening all i just want to point<br>out that nick college has no numbers on<br>those graphs which is<br>interesting i'll try to put some numbers<br>on at least one or two i'll show<br>you yeah so um awesome my my job here<br>tonight i guess is to bring a lot of<br>um the discussion the science the<br>discovery that you've heard about<br>um around antarctica closer to home to<br>the to the coastal regions<br>of aotearoa which is which is an area<br>that many many of us<br>are concerned about and interested in so<br>i'm going to talk a little bit about<br>some of the work we've been doing<br>in the new zealand sea rise program<br>involves<br>many people on the uh on the science<br>prize<br>winning team but also many others that<br>i'll acknowledge some of as we go<br>through<br>um now we've talked a lot about ice<br>sheets in their contribution to sea<br>level rise but of course there are many<br>other<br>things that are contributing to our<br>oceans<br>growth and height including thermosteric<br>effects the expansion of the oceans as<br>they warm up<br>the melt of glaciers and ice caps and<br>there was a nice<br>well maybe not a nice paper but a<br>concerning paper attributing some of the<br>glacial melting<br>in um the south island of new zealand<br>that came out in a paper today i got<br>some press today or yesterday uh so i'd<br>encourage you to<br>check out those news reads documenting<br>how our<br>glaciers our own glaciers here at home<br>are retreating<br>um ocean dynamics play a role in causing<br>sea level to go up or down<br>um depending on where the heat in the<br>oceans flow<br>causes the ocean's height to rise more<br>or less<br>land water storage auckland doesn't know<br>much about the issues around land water<br>storage given<br>recent stresses they've undergone but<br>the amount of water humans take and put<br>on land or<br>the rainfall on the land gets captured<br>in the soil<br>actually keeps water out of the ocean<br>and of course if you release that water<br>back into the ocean oceans can go up<br>and then land movement has an effect on<br>local sea level what the sea level will<br>actually do<br>around our coastlines so when we're<br>trying to understand and project sea<br>level<br>we've got to consider all of those<br>components and<br>when i say we i don't mean any of us<br>sitting up here because we don't know<br>how to do this<br>but we are working with two of the<br>world's experts if not the world's<br>experts<br>at rutgers university who take all of<br>this information<br>all of the information from models that<br>project into the future what will happen<br>to land water storage<br>ice sheet melt models such as nick's<br>been talking about<br>glacier melt put it put it all in<br>together into a probabilistic framework<br>to actually produce a local sea level<br>projection<br>and that's what the new zealand sea rise<br>program is attempting to do<br>for for us we're going to be projecting<br>all around the coast of new zealand all<br>around at about a one degree spacing<br>to produce location specific sea level<br>projections<br>and this will really enhance what has<br>been done up to this point<br>through new zealand's coastal hazards<br>guidance which has taken all of the<br>information<br>that is available and given a sort of<br>nationwide projection<br>for for our coastlines we're trying to<br>get to a little bit more detail than<br>that to tell you<br>what sea level will be in the what sea<br>level will do in the hierarchy<br>versus in dunedin versus on the west<br>coast so that<br>decisions can be made with the most<br>i'm just going to talk a little bit<br>about one of the challenges we have in<br>making these projections and this is one<br>thing that in the coastal hazard's<br>guidance was acknowledged<br>that vertical land movement wasn't<br>included in those projections for new<br>zealand<br>and i suspect most of us acknowledge<br>have felt realise that our land is quite<br>dynamic goes up and down<br>we feel earthquakes fairly regularly but<br>what i'm showing here is some<br>some plots from our gps stations so we<br>we actually measure in new zealand our<br>vertical land movement<br>or our land movement through geonet<br>which obviously is looking at<br>horizontal displacements as earthquakes<br>occur but also vertical offsets<br>um and and what these graphs here are<br>showing these brightly colored<br>graphs um is several stations from<br>auckland all the way down to dunedin<br>some gps stations<br>showing the relative motion of the land<br>across<br>you know annual time scales and what<br>just drawing your attention to<br>wellington here there's a gradual<br>decrease a slight rise when a major<br>earthquake occurs and so on and so forth<br>so you're seeing that over time this<br>land is going down<br>and of course as if land is going down<br>and sea level is going up<br>then that amplifies or extends the<br>amount of sea level that you'll get on<br>the coastline at that point<br>if the opposite is happening land's<br>going up sea level is going up<br>if the land rate rises faster than sea<br>level then you'll actually<br>not get a local sea level rise so it's<br>really important to get this<br>this component as accurate as possible<br>we're also using cetera satellite<br>interferometry this is a colleague of<br>mine<br>uh genius ian hamling is using uh<br>essentially a satellite that's circling<br>orbiting the earth<br>beams down a radar bounces off the earth<br>back to the radar and you can actually<br>measure at sub millimeter resolution<br>changes in elevation as those satellites<br>orbit<br>um pretty amazing stuff this is an image<br>of or a compilation of some of the data<br>from one of those satellite<br>satellite-derived<br>vertical land movement measurements<br>and you can see the whole of new zealand<br>on in this plot here<br>the blues are areas that are going down<br>and up to eight millimeters per year in<br>some of these coast<br>places so this part of the east coast of<br>the north island going down<br>quite rapidly an area here pickaway<br>along the bay of plenty<br>um going up fairly rapidly so you can<br>start to see we can get a broad<br>nationwide coverage of vertical land<br>movement that we can then integrate<br>into these sea level projections this is<br>a close-up of dunedin<br>i'm just showing you how regionally you<br>can get quite a lot of variability this<br>is reclaimed land<br>and it's going down around five<br>millimeters per year bunning's warehouse<br>has got a big crack in it apparently<br>from where the land's settling<br>so sea level rise along this coast will<br>be much more rapid<br>than sea level rise along along this<br>coast so you can see how the spatial<br>variability is<br>it's important to get um sorted this is<br>just an example of how<br>vertical land movement can make a major<br>impact on your<br>your sea level projections this is a<br>plot<br>that we've generated from the data that<br>bob kopp and his colleague at rutgers<br>have produced for us<br>so this is this blue line is actually a<br>modified sea level<br>rise or sea level projection for dunedin<br>using this<br>this location so offshore dunedin<br>showing under a relatively high<br>or warm climate scenario it's not rcp<br>8.5 but it's a<br>it's a high-end climate scenario showing<br>what sea level will do<br>out to 2100 so one meter just over a<br>meter of sea level rise<br>in the dunedin area this is the actual<br>tide gate measurement produced from our<br>colleagues at niwa<br>showing that we're tracking along along<br>that path<br>but of course we're not going to know<br>really how we how we end up until<br>2030 2040. but this is the effect that<br>a vertical land subsidence of five<br>millimeters so in that herbicide<br>area this is what the vertical land<br>movement will do to that sea level<br>projection<br>and from a policy point of view<br>essentially to take home messages it<br>brings everything forward by about 10<br>years a decade so if you're planning on<br>a certain magnitude of sea level<br>rise by 2050 you add in vertical land<br>movement you got to bring your thinking<br>forward by about<br>a decade so vertical land movement<br>matters in new zealand of course the<br>opposite can happen where the region<br>where regions are going up<br>what we're finally what we're starting<br>to do now in the in the sea rise program<br>is take some of these new projections<br>and start to look at physical<br>impact studies and this is just one<br>example showing what we're doing with<br>with otago regional council in dunedin<br>city council<br>taking the groundwater model for the<br>south dunedin region<br>and this is a model that's been run 100<br>times over and over again under modern<br>conditions<br>just to see what model variability to<br>capture the range of<br>model variability showing which regions<br>are likely to get groundwater inundation<br>from a probability landscape so<br>relatively high<br>probability of flooding in this this<br>area today<br>if you start to use some of those higher<br>end sea level projections this is what<br>the probability looks like<br>by 2100 under rcp 8.5 so you can start<br>to see how sea level<br>rise affects the probability of<br>inundation in the south dunedin region<br>and this is the difference between today<br>and in 2100 under those high sea level<br>projections so these are the sorts of<br>things where you can start to look at<br>flood frequency start to bring in the<br>physical system science into a risk<br>scape analysis<br>to then start to inform policy around<br>when you may need to either increase<br>your storm water system efficiency or<br>perhaps um<br>enter into some kind of managed retreat<br>so this is bringing the physical science<br>and trying to put it into a planning<br>perspective<br>and i think we're going to hear a little<br>bit more about that from the next level<br>yeah thanks richard and you did right<br>we're about to hear a little bit more<br>um about the implications of those sea<br>level rises<br>for new zealand so i mean the picture<br>that's evolving is<br>not only did we underestimate the<br>potential contribution of the antarctic<br>ice sheet to sea level rise for new<br>zealand<br>but we had we haven't yet taken into<br>account those vertical land movements<br>which obviously<br>make a big difference so judy lawrence<br>our next speaker<br>is well known to many of you she has<br>many years experience of climate<br>adaptation and mitigation policy<br>and recently chaired a ministerial<br>climate adaptation task<br>group she has worked across government<br>for many years before doing a phd in sea<br>level rise adaptation and decision<br>making<br>at the climate change research centre at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>where she holds a part-time senior<br>research fellowship<br>it's just as well it's only part-time<br>because judy is also<br>a newly minted commissioner for the new<br>zealand climate commission<br>she is a coordinating lead author that<br>means she's in charge of a chapter for<br>the ipcc report<br>and it happens to be the australasia<br>chapter<br>and judy's work is at the very applied<br>end of our team<br>and we like to say where the rubber hits<br>the road and where the science evidence<br>meets decision making and policy<br>development<br>so<br>god judy you tim well if you thought<br>that was hard<br>actually doing something about it is the<br>most challenging<br>thing we have to do and i think in<br>summary<br>this two degrees we have to keep two<br>keep two and the only way we can do that<br>is to reduce our emissions<br>but unfortunately we have quite a lot in<br>the pipeline<br>still coming which is the lag that um<br>nick talked about him earlier<br>and so that lag is what we have to adapt<br>to<br>and that is a difficult task but which<br>has been a team effort across many<br>organizations<br>and i have to take my hat off to my<br>colleague rob bell whose pictures there<br>and the niwa people<br>um because we've forged a very um<br>good relationship in actually<br>taking the science and working with the<br>people who matter which are our citizens<br>now what we need to do<br>to address this problem of adaptation<br>is that we need decision tools we need<br>to be monitoring what we're doing<br>and we need to have what we call<br>enablers in other words<br>the instruments that are necessary for<br>decision making<br>and what this has actually happened what<br>has happened as a result of all this<br>work we've been doing is that across<br>victoria university we<br>interact with our lawyers we interact<br>with our psychologists<br>we interact with a whole number of<br>people our economists<br>and we have a very tidy team<br>but we can't do that without our<br>international<br>colleagues as well and i'll come to that<br>in a minute<br>because we work with the dutch very<br>closely<br>now why do we need to have particular<br>tools for adaptation to sea level rise<br>and i think you might have a hint of it<br>in the earlier talks<br>and this is because in the near term<br>we're fairly certain about what is going<br>to happen<br>because it's sort of happening now and<br>it's developing<br>and we're getting a better understanding<br>of what the rate of that changes<br>from the work that we've had presented<br>tonight<br>however around that 2040 period<br>which both richard and nick have talked<br>about<br>things start to diverge and the<br>uncertainty increases<br>and it's what we call deep uncertainty<br>because we can't we can project things<br>but they're not predictions we can't<br>know in the future<br>and so we need tools that can deal with<br>that sort of uncertainty<br>and enter the dutch on the left hand<br>side<br>one of my colleagues marilyn hashni has<br>developed this<br>idea of a metro map to think about the<br>problem over time<br>as the sea level rises<br>it is changing over time but we don't<br>know exactly the rate and we don't know<br>exactly the timing of this two degrees<br>we've got an idea<br>but we've we don't know exactly within<br>the time frames that we make decisions<br>and so if you can think of going to the<br>london metro um<br>it will be a while but if we think about<br>that metro map<br>we can get to a destination through a<br>number of means<br>different routes and we can visualize<br>those<br>and think about the conditions under<br>which we<br>are going forward and<br>if we take an action we ask these<br>questions along the bottom<br>which are under what conditions will the<br>strategies we're doing now<br>fail and so we actually use scenarios to<br>think about that<br>what the future might look like that<br>would actually condition us<br>condition something to fail like a stock<br>bank like a levee like a seawall<br>it could be a human failure because it<br>could be a coping failure which could<br>actually be much sooner<br>than the actual failure of a levee<br>for example and so along the bottom of<br>this metro map<br>we use scenarios to do the what if<br>exercise to say if we did this and this<br>and this what would it look like in the<br>future<br>how where are the conditions where those<br>options would fail and so we develop a<br>set of pathways<br>now we've used these already in new<br>zealand they were first applied in the<br>hutt valley it was a first for new<br>zealand and actually a first<br>probably in the world because it was a<br>real life<br>decision that was being made about the<br>completion of the hutt river flood plain<br>flood management plan we've now applied<br>this in the hawke's bay<br>for the coastal area and we're about to<br>develop further the work to indicate<br>signals and triggers that might develop<br>and where these points are where we need<br>to make decisions in the future<br>and the picture in the middle is um one<br>of scott stevens from niwa<br>who put together some coastal pathways<br>to visualize with the hawke's bay people<br>what it might look like in the future<br>now as well as the climate scenarios<br>that we've heard about tonight<br>we've also developed in another program<br>um shared socio-economic scenarios so we<br>can think about what sort of<br>world we might be in the future<br>whether it's a um kicking and streaming<br>100<br>smart and unspecific pacific etcetera<br>and we describe these their narratives<br>and we test these<br>against the options that we're<br>developing for coastal<br>um for coastal management and so we ask<br>as well as under what conditions<br>will the strategies fail how sensitive<br>are the options<br>to each of those scenarios and what<br>alternative paths can be taken<br>and most importantly can we change path<br>so we ask that question about path<br>dependency<br>as we go through this process there's no<br>point in building something<br>that has a long lifetime but which you<br>can't actually<br>change along the way as the world<br>changes around you<br>so that's working with uncertainty and<br>change and also<br>the work that we've been doing has been<br>integrated into the government's<br>coastal hazards and climate change<br>guidance and this is a very simple<br>10-step decision cycle that was<br>developed<br>rob bell led this process i was a<br>co-author and there were several others<br>involved<br>including sylvia allen who's a planner<br>so again we're working in very good<br>disciplinary teams<br>and we ask what is happening what what<br>matters most to communities<br>what can we do about it how can we<br>implement a strategy<br>and how is it working or we're<br>monitoring because we want to<br>iterate through a process as the world<br>changes so we need something quite<br>dynamic<br>and we've developed indicators i<br>mentioned them a minute ago<br>these indicators aren't just when the<br>water's lapping up<br>in front of us they could be cultural<br>indicators like the loss of taiwan<br>and we've already seen some of that<br>happening in new zealand at the coast<br>they could be social indicators how many<br>times<br>in auckland going to mission bay do<br>people going to work want to be<br>disruptive for example<br>what's the coping level of that<br>community<br>and environmental indicators like the<br>loss of amenity<br>and we already have insurance indicators<br>we have a signal already that the<br>insurance industry is making adjustments<br>to<br>both their price or the pricing of risk<br>effectively and that will come through<br>in premiums and also<br>lack of cover or removal of cover<br>increasingly coastal areas are not<br>covered<br>um for for inundation flooding for<br>flooding<br>coastal flooding and so the way we think<br>about this is to have these signals or<br>warnings<br>and we want to be able to to trigger a<br>decision<br>well before we meet these coping<br>thresholds<br>so this notion of lead time again comes<br>in here because it takes a very long<br>time to get up at some sort of<br>protection work<br>you can throw a a truck of<br>rock over a beach it will<br>probably only last a few years and<br>if you build anything stronger there's<br>still going to be a residual risk when<br>these numbers keep coming up<br>and we've developed a um a routine if<br>you like<br>for decision makers to think about how<br>they go about monitoring the system<br>and that's the picture on the on the<br>right<br>so lastly what do we need to<br>have to be able to do this adaptation<br>work<br>as well as the science that we've heard<br>about tonight<br>we have to understand not just the<br>hazard but we need to understand the<br>risk<br>and that comes down to what is at risk<br>niwa recently completed an<br>excellent piece of work looking at where<br>all the coastal risk areas were<br>and most of the problems occur well<br>below<br>one metre of sea level rise and just by<br>way of example in the<br>in pattoni you only need 30 centimetres<br>of sea level rise before you have to<br>completely change your drainage system<br>from a gravity<br>drainage system to a pump vacuum system<br>or something else and we have students<br>who've been working on this<br>this problem which is starting to inform<br>how you might manage the retreat of<br>coastal areas and i have to say there's<br>a lot of interest we've just posted a<br>paper out<br>a couple of weeks ago and there's been<br>lots of email traffic interested in this<br>sort of work because nowhere else is<br>actually doing it<br>in quite the way we are here we need to<br>be communicating the risk<br>we need to have the statutory mandates<br>sorted which they are a bit of a mess at<br>the moment and there was a 531-page<br>report came out last week<br>by judge renderson and he has<br>an excellent plan so now we need<br>that plan to be implemented where the<br>mandates<br>the the guidance and the codes of<br>practice<br>can be developed in new zealand<br>but the elephant in the room is really<br>funding and<br>compensation and issues like that when<br>you're dealing with existing uses of<br>land<br>proprietary rights etc and<br>the randison report also addresses that<br>issue<br>and suggests a managed retreat and<br>adaptation act<br>where the funding a fund might be set up<br>which is pre-funded like a<br>superannuation<br>in a very similar way and can help<br>so we need to get prepared and it's<br>urgent<br>thank you<br>yes um thank you judy very very wise<br>words<br>um our next speaker would have been<br>rebecca priestly<br>and and there she is but her husband has<br>a book launched tonight and so that that<br>sort of took precedence which we<br>we completely understand but i just want<br>to talk a little bit about the last<br>aspect of the team which is rebecca<br>and science communication so rebecca is<br>a associate professor and director of<br>the centre of science and society at<br>victoria<br>she is a public engagement expert whose<br>research spans<br>the history of science earth science and<br>science communication<br>she's written a lot of books you're<br>probably aware of she's a great science<br>communicator<br>and she's particularly concerned in how<br>we get our message across<br>and are we getting it across correctly<br>and so she she ran the survey<br>and and the results are really<br>interesting i'm just going to show you a<br>couple of them and it was to gauge the<br>public understanding<br>of what's happening with sea level rise<br>how much do you expect<br>but before i show you the server i'm<br>going to ask you a question<br>and this is the start of the audience<br>engagement and then we'll throw it open<br>to<br>so hands up<br>if you think sea level rise by the end<br>of the century around new zealand<br>on average will be greater than a meter<br>there's no right or wrong here guys it's<br>not a yeah<br>okay those are the those are the<br>pessimists<br>and hands up those who think sea level<br>will be less than a meter<br>yeah okay interesting all right<br>let's try it was about 50 50 by the way<br>so let's try<br>um let's try another question<br>what do you think is the worst case<br>scientifically plausible<br>sea level rise we could expect by<br>i'll give you a hands up in a minute by<br>is it above two meters<br>who thinks it could be we could get more<br>than two meters of sea level rise<br>yes that's interesting who thinks we<br>could get more than three meters of sea<br>level rise<br>and this is if antarctica does bad<br>things and the land<br>suddenly drops well let's leave that out<br>of it but if we get some vertical land<br>movement<br>yeah okay there's a few of you there's a<br>few of you okay let's let's just quickly<br>look at the results of rebecca's survey<br>so the first one at the top is<br>is asking people how much do you think<br>global sea level is projected to rise<br>and and i guess you you were you<br>reflected that the results of that<br>survey<br>50 said less than a meter and 50 said<br>more than a meter<br>and in this case eight percent said more<br>than five meters<br>right and then um<br>below um you can see that there are a<br>substantial amount of people that are<br>you know there's some pretty biblical<br>things about to happen there's sea level<br>rise of more than 15 meters<br>so this is a concern that we're not<br>getting our message across<br>this is worst case scenario but um<br>so the scientifically plausible worst<br>case scenario<br>you wouldn't expect more than two meters<br>of sea level rise by the end of the<br>century<br>i think would be safe to say and so why<br>aren't we getting our message across is<br>it because media<br>are tending to go towards the more<br>dramatic<br>stories the higher numbers<br>is it because perhaps scientists are<br>doing that as well<br>is it because you know the uncertainty<br>there's so much uncertainty as we've<br>seen in sea level rise<br>so we'll just leave it at that at there<br>in terms of the communication but<br>it's it's really important that the<br>things we are finding out and<br>discovering<br>are being communicated correctly not<br>only to the public but also<br>engagement with stakeholders who need<br>that information<br>we'll leave it at that so thank you very<br>much for coming along hope it's not due<br>to pressing and you go home and<br>you know maybe you need a glass of wine<br>but thanks very much<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none;
