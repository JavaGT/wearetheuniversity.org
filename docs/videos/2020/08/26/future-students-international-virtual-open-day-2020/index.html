of waikato in new zealand a<br>bit about what it's like<br>to live and study in new zealand as an<br>international student<br>and some information about our two<br>campuses in hamilton<br>and toronto and if you have any<br>questions while i'm talking then<br>please feel free to type them into the<br>chat function<br>so the university of waikato is located<br>um<br>in on the north island of new zealand<br>our main<br>campus is in hamilton and we have a<br>secondary campus<br>in poland the main city the biggest city<br>in new zealand<br>is auckland and this is where you will<br>fly into as an<br>international student when you first<br>come to new zealand<br>it's about a 12-hour flight from china<br>um about 17<br>or so hours direct from dubai or qatar<br>and there are many international flights<br>that fly into auckland<br>from auckland it's about an hour and 45<br>minutes or so<br>um into hamilton um you normally<br>go by car or by bus um and then to<br>tallanger about two hours<br>so um and uh so hamilton is a<br>medium-sized city it's about 165 000<br>people<br>um as i say on the north island of new<br>zealand it's close to auckland close to<br>lots of uh<br>interesting and exciting things to see<br>and do um<br>around new zealand and you can see tonga<br>just on the coast a really beautiful<br>coastal city<br>and where we have our new city centre<br>campus<br>so this is hamilton city itself um it's<br>as i say<br>um a smallish city it's a very friendly<br>and safe city great place to live you<br>can see it's very green<br>the beautiful waikato river going<br>through the center of hamilton there<br>and the university is about a 15-minute<br>bus ride away<br>across the bridge and over to and<br>outskirts<br>of hamilton um hamilton is quite a<br>student city lots of students<br>um who study both at wintec the uh<br>polytechnic institution um and then also<br>obviously the university of waikato<br>itself<br>so and before i talk a bit more about<br>studying<br>with us i'd like to talk about why you<br>might want to choose new zealand as a<br>study<br>destination and so firstly safety<br>new zealand is uh the second most<br>peaceful country in the world according<br>to the 2019 global<br>peace index obviously there's a lot<br>going on in the world at the moment and<br>safety is one of the top priorities for<br>international students and so you can be<br>assured that new zealand is a very safe<br>place to live<br>and study um quality um<br>new zealand universities all rank within<br>the top of 500<br>um in the 2021 um us world rankings<br>so the quality of education is excellent<br>and<br>we have excellent work opportunities<br>also for<br>our graduates so if you're an<br>international student<br>and you complete a bachelor's degree or<br>a master's degree<br>then you should be eligible for a<br>three-year post-study work<br>visa after you graduate and that means<br>you can work<br>uh anywhere in new zealand um for three<br>years<br>and then uh following that to maybe look<br>um at the potential<br>of her residency and then of course<br>new zealand is a laid-back relaxed<br>destination<br>it's quite different to other study<br>destinations such as the uk<br>and canada the us and australia and so<br>on<br>we're a much smaller much more friendly<br>laid-back<br>relaxed place to live and to study we<br>don't have huge cities<br>24-hour party nightlife and so on but if<br>you like the outdoors and you like<br>nature<br>and you like that sort of more laid-back<br>way of life than new zealand<br>very well um i've just got a few<br>pictures here to show you<br>um of um the beauty of the new zealand<br>and countryside and all the places you<br>can visit if you come to study with us<br>so this is bridal veil falls this is<br>about half an hour from hamilton itself<br>a great place to visit<br>um with friends take a picnic for lunch<br>go walking around<br>and see the beautiful natural wonders<br>of new zealand um this is hobbiton so if<br>you<br>uh know lord of the rings or the hobbit<br>movies then you'll have heard of um<br>hobbiton<br>this is the movie set um where um those<br>movies were filmed<br>and you can go and visit go and have a<br>look around again with with friends and<br>family really really popular place to go<br>um with<br>people who visit new zealand and that's<br>about an hour from hamilton<br>and you can see raglan beach here um<br>about half an hour again from from<br>hamilton<br>um world-class surfing if you're um into<br>uh<br>into surfing and again a great place to<br>spend the day<br>and then you have um the uh bird plenty<br>region this is close to tolonga<br>um rotorua and the hot springs you can<br>go and bathe in the<br>hot springs and go and see the<br>geothermal activity um<br>there's the ski fields um they are about<br>two or three hours south of hamilton and<br>todonga<br>um and uh if you can go and take up<br>skiing or snowboarding if you haven't<br>ever tried it before um again a great<br>experience to have<br>and then the south island is absolutely<br>a stunning place to<br>visit and uh really top of people's<br>lists when they visit new zealand for<br>the first time<br>you can see the beautiful mountains here<br>the glacial lakes and of course in the<br>summer<br>wonderful natural beauty down in the<br>south island<br>so the university of waikato itself is<br>ranked 375<br>in the uh 2021 us world rankings<br>our management school is triple crown<br>accredited which means<br>that it is accredited by aacsb amba and<br>equus these are the three<br>most important business bodies worldwide<br>so that puts our management school<br>in the top one percent of management<br>schools worldwide<br>only around one percent have that triple<br>crown accreditation<br>and as i've said hamilton um is a<br>medium-sized city it's actually the<br>fourth largest city in new zealand<br>uh todonga being the fifth largest um<br>and it's close to auckland<br>um great vibrant student community and a<br>really good place to be based<br>for your studies and then of course<br>costs<br>so new zealand is cheaper than many<br>other<br>traditional study destinations<br>particularly in terms of living costs<br>and if you come and live in hamilton<br>orlando then<br>the living costs are significantly<br>cheaper<br>than larger cities such as auckland<br>sydney melbourne and so on<br>now we put a very strong focus on<br>employability<br>for international students we know that<br>employability is one of the most<br>important factors<br>when students are making their um<br>decisions on their study destination<br>um so most of our bachelor's degrees um<br>include a<br>compulsory one semester internship so<br>that's normally one day per week or one<br>semester in<br>third year and a number of our<br>postgraduate degrees also<br>include internships and placements<br>eighty-five percent of our graduates are<br>employed within a year of completing<br>their studies<br>um and the new zealand economy is strong<br>despite covert 19 and is expected<br>to become stronger in the next few years<br>so there will be a lot of<br>opportunities for students who come and<br>study with us<br>um the new zealand government publishes<br>something called the long-term skill<br>shortage list<br>and you can see a list of the areas of<br>um skill shortage<br>um and this is where the government is<br>trying to attract people<br>to new zealand with those skills or who<br>want to study in those areas<br>and there are attractive post-study<br>opportunities for those students<br>as well so as i've said there is a<br>post-study work pathway that allows<br>students to stay in new zealand and work<br>after graduation so for bachelors and<br>master's degree students they would be<br>eligible for a three-year<br>post-study work visa and students who<br>are studying<br>a graduate diploma um outside of<br>auckland and so for example in hamilton<br>or tonga<br>are eligible for a two-year post-study<br>work visa<br>up to the end of next year and then one<br>year<br>so we have a large number of internships<br>and placements as i've said for our<br>students<br>and these cover many different areas of<br>study<br>so you can see a list here hopefully you<br>can find the program you're interested<br>in<br>and get an idea of the internship that<br>may be on offer<br>some internships are longer over the<br>course<br>of maybe two or three months um and uh<br>maybe taken in the university holidays<br>um<br>some are shorter um particularly for<br>master's degrees maybe over a four week<br>period<br>across a semester so maybe one day per<br>week and<br>one semester some of our internships are<br>guaranteed we will find<br>those internships for students some<br>internships the students will need to<br>find<br>themselves so you can see our hamilton<br>campus here<br>really beautiful green campus a great<br>place to<br>be based for your studies and we have<br>halls of residence<br>um on campus so this is where you may<br>live<br>and then it's just a five or ten minute<br>walk to your lectures<br>um and we actually have the largest<br>campus by area<br>in new zealand so as i say really green<br>beautiful<br>you can also see here our toddler campus<br>um and this is a brand new<br>um purpose-built campus that was<br>completed<br>last year in 2019 and<br>it's a city center campus so it's<br>self-contained<br>um much smaller than the hamilton campus<br>i've just shown you<br>um but tolanga is a fantastic place to<br>be based if you prefer that smaller<br>student community if you'd like to live<br>by the beach as well<br>um with a really fantastic city beach<br>lifestyle and then excellent study and<br>post study work opportunities<br>afterwards and then uh todonga is a<br>really excellent<br>choice for you you can see the programs<br>that we offer here so we have a wide<br>range of different programs offered at<br>the toronto campus<br>and some of them are split between<br>olonga<br>now obviously covered 19 is something<br>that's very important to talk about<br>everybody is thinking about their um<br>future study plans<br>um with uh the view to what's going to<br>happen<br>um in terms of curb at 19. so at the<br>moment you may know that new zealand's<br>borders are closed<br>to international students so you won't<br>be able to<br>enter new zealand this year as an<br>international student<br>we have an intake in november which will<br>be fully online<br>but students will be able to progress to<br>face-to-face study as soon as the<br>borders reopen and they're able to get a<br>visa<br>so we're hopeful that next year new<br>zealand's borders will reopen<br>and then you will be able to progress to<br>face-to-face study if you start in<br>november<br>um for students that start online we<br>actually have a 20<br>tuition fee reduction and when you come<br>to um actually study face-to-face in new<br>zealand when you travel to new zealand<br>you will be given a 2 000 new zealand<br>dollar travel grant to cover<br>your travel costs so um a 20<br>free reduction for all of your online<br>papers and<br>a 2 000 new zealand travel grant<br>or traveling to new zealand we accept<br>provisional grades and calculated grades<br>if you haven't been able to get<br>official grades from uh your institution<br>or your school<br>and and we're also accepting a number of<br>um online english tests<br>for example ielts indicator and we have<br>toefl home based<br>um and duolingo as well all of those<br>different types of online english tests<br>so you don't have to sit<br>to test face to face<br>now we have a huge range of different<br>faculties and schools of study you can<br>see a list here<br>um and i'm going to um pick out a few<br>programs that are popular with<br>international students<br>and give you an overview of those<br>programs bear in mind that we offer a<br>huge<br>range of different programs of study so<br>please do go to our website<br>ycattle.ac.nz and have a look for the<br>program that you might be interested in<br>if i haven't<br>talked about it today so the first<br>program is the bachelor of business<br>so this is very popular with<br>international students and we have<br>a range of different majors that you can<br>take you can see the table at the bottom<br>there are nine different majors<br>within the bachelor of business you<br>could do a double major or a major and a<br>minor perhaps<br>but this is a three-year bachelor's<br>degree and we have three intakes per<br>year so february july<br>and november and the cost is around<br>30 000 new zealand dollars per year<br>that's about 20<br>000 us dollars per year that would be<br>the tuition fee<br>and as i said the uh management school<br>is triple crown accredited and one of<br>the top 1<br>of management schools worldwide so um<br>it's a really<br>excellent place to study and would look<br>very good on your cv<br>and we have a one semester workplace<br>internship for this program in the third<br>year and i'll be one day per week<br>and if you choose the accounting major<br>and then you can get<br>fast track to chartered accounts and<br>status um<br>so um the um acca<br>have 14 different exams that you need to<br>take<br>to become an acca recognized chartered<br>accountant<br>if you take the accounting major then<br>you will get nine exemptions from those<br>14<br>exams which means you only have to take<br>five more exams once you've graduated<br>and get some work experience in order to<br>be<br>acc um if you want to take a<br>four year bachelor's degree of business<br>then you can do the bachelor of<br>management studies<br>which may lead to post-graduate study in<br>the future<br>um you can see here this is the bachelor<br>of engineering um with honor so this is<br>a four year honours degree<br>um and this is um an accredited course<br>this is accredited by engineering new<br>zealand<br>and once you've graduated you will be<br>able to work<br>as a recognized chartered engineer in 19<br>different countries<br>around the world and that's part of the<br>washington accord<br>um so it's a really excellent degree<br>to study if you want to get a high level<br>engineering job and<br>be able to progress from there so as i<br>say it's a four-year degree<br>um it has intakes in february and july<br>the cost<br>is around 37 000 new zealand dollars per<br>year<br>probably about 25 000 us dollars per<br>year<br>and this program also has um 800 hours<br>of work experience which is normally<br>paid<br>so we would place you with a company or<br>around hamilton<br>and that would be in years two three and<br>four of the program<br>and you can get an idea of the majors or<br>the streams um in the table<br>just at the bottom there so when you<br>have eight different choices for your<br>engineering degree<br>so the next program is the bachelor of<br>arts this is a three-year<br>bachelor's degree um uh there are a huge<br>range of different majors that you can<br>see here<br>so um you've got over 20<br>different choices here of areas of study<br>and this program has intakes in february<br>and july and the cost varies depending<br>on the major<br>and between 25 and 33 000<br>again maybe 20 of 23 24 000<br>us dollars and this program<br>does have work placement opportunities<br>depending on the major<br>that you choose and you could work with<br>a business or a community group<br>and and then finally for bachelor's<br>degrees we have the bachelor of science<br>so this again is a three-year degree a<br>choice of 12 different majors that you<br>can see here<br>intakes in february and july you can see<br>the cost 30 to 33<br>000 new zealand um and<br>some of these majors will offer work<br>experience<br>um placement capacity<br>um so that would be the bachelor of<br>science in<br>technology so you can get 10 weeks of<br>work experience which again would<br>normally<br>this is our most popular master's degree<br>so this is the master of business and<br>management<br>and it's popular for three reasons and<br>firstly that is a 12-month<br>intensive master's program so you can<br>complete<br>your master of business and management<br>in 12 months<br>and then be eligible for a three-year<br>post-study work visa<br>so you can stay in new zealand for three<br>years after graduation<br>um it's also popular because you don't<br>need a business background<br>to enter this master's degree you can<br>get direct entry with any bachelor's<br>degree<br>geography you study biology anything<br>then you can get direct<br>entry into the master of business and<br>management<br>and the third reason is popular is<br>because it has a guaranteed one-month<br>internship so this is towards the end of<br>the program<br>we will find the internship for you we<br>will place you into the<br>internship with the company and you'll<br>be able to get work experience which<br>would be important for your cv<br>so it has intakes in march july and<br>november the cost is around forty six<br>thousand<br>new zealand dollars around thirty<br>thousand us dollars<br>and again it's part of the uh triple<br>crown accredited management school<br>which is a top one percent worldwide um<br>and for this program you'd need<br>bachelor's degree as i say in any<br>discipline<br>so the next program this is more<br>specialized this is the master of<br>management studies so this really is for<br>students who do<br>have a business background you can see<br>the specialisms in the table at the<br>bottom<br>and if you um are wanting to study this<br>program<br>you need to have a bachelor's degree in<br>the specialism that you're choosing<br>for example if you want to do the master<br>of management studies in marketing<br>you need to have a marketing bachelor's<br>degree so you'll be gaining specialized<br>knowledge in a specific area<br>of management and you will be um there<br>will be a research<br>component to this program so you will<br>need to um<br>maybe spend a portion of the program on<br>a research<br>um project um so the intakes are<br>february and july and uh the cost is<br>just under 45 000 new zealand dollars 30<br>000<br>um the next program is a new program<br>called the master of management and this<br>um has its first intake in november<br>so um this is a 12 month intensive<br>program quite similar to the master of<br>business and management<br>but in this program you will specialize<br>in an area of business<br>so you can choose either supply chain<br>management or marketing<br>and again this program will be very<br>popular because you don't need a<br>business background<br>to get direct entry into the program<br>the cost um forty five thousand new<br>zealand dollars thirty thousand<br>us dollars um and again it has a<br>guaranteed one<br>one month work placement<br>um so very similar to the master of<br>business and management but you will<br>specialize in either supply chain<br>the next program is the master of<br>professional accounting so<br>this one is a 14-month um intensive<br>master's program<br>um it's for people who don't have a<br>background in<br>accounting so any bachelor's degree you<br>would be accepted um<br>for entry into the master of<br>professional accounting<br>um it has intakes in january and<br>november and the cost is just over fifty<br>thousand<br>new zealand dollars or about um<br>thirty thousand or so um us dollars<br>the uh program will give you a<br>provisional membership of acca just like<br>the bachelor of business with the nine<br>acca um exemptions and again<br>um there is a one-month internship<br>available<br>but this is dependent on availability<br>and your<br>and then we have the master of applied<br>finance so this program again is 12<br>month<br>intensive master's degree if you are<br>looking for a career in the finance<br>industry<br>but you don't necessarily have a finance<br>background then this program<br>may be suitable for you so we will<br>accept people<br>from a bachelor's degree in any<br>discipline but you must have<br>some quantitative analysis quantitative<br>analysis skills<br>um that you have um completed as part of<br>your<br>bachelor's degree um so this one<br>um this uh degree um has a february<br>intake<br>it has a one month internship although<br>that's not guaranteed depends on<br>availability<br>and and it can lead to um the um<br>cfa the chartered financial analyst<br>designation so as i say in a career in<br>finance if you don't have that finance<br>background<br>and then moving away from business um<br>just a few other<br>programs that are popular with<br>international students the first one<br>here is the master of information<br>technology<br>so this program is attractive for a<br>couple of reasons<br>firstly and mainly i'd say because of<br>the 10-week compulsory paid internship<br>so students um who study this program as<br>long as they<br>achieve good grades will be able to um<br>undertake an internship at the end of<br>the program and uh then you'd be paid<br>5 000 new zealand dollars for that<br>internship<br>we would find the internship for you and<br>so it's guaranteed as long as you<br>achieve<br>grades this has intakes in february and<br>july<br>and um you can actually enter the<br>program even if you don't have a<br>computing background<br>but you would need to take a<br>postgraduate certificate<br>and achieve the right grades um in order<br>then to enter the master of information<br>technology<br>the cost is um just over 51 000 new<br>zealand dollars so 30 to 35 000 us<br>dollars<br>um and as i say one to 1.5 years if you<br>do have a computing background<br>1.5 to 2 years if you don't and the<br>qualification is actually<br>awarded jointly with the university<br>so when you get your degree certificate<br>then<br>it will state that um the master of<br>information technology is awarded<br>jointly by the university of whitehall<br>and the university of auckland<br>um so this program has a number of<br>compulsory papers that you can see<br>below and a number of elective papers so<br>you can choose your<br>the next program is the master of<br>engineering practice so this<br>is a 1 to one point five year master's<br>degree<br>and it has three specialisms so<br>electronics materials and processing and<br>mechanical<br>engineering and this is a talk master's<br>degree so there's no<br>research um which is different to our<br>normal master of engineering<br>the intake is february and the cost is<br>around 53<br>000 new zealand dollars about 35 000<br>us and the program also includes a<br>management component<br>so you would get some management<br>experience allowing you to<br>maybe go into a career in engineering<br>so the other the final area of study<br>that i'd like to talk about now<br>is phd study now phd study is very very<br>popular<br>in new zealand and that's because<br>international students pay<br>domestic fees so an annual<br>phd tuition fee is around 6500<br>new zealand dollars per year or about 4<br>000 us dollars per year which is a lot<br>cheaper than other countries but because<br>of that<br>we have a huge number of applications<br>every year and competition is very<br>fierce<br>so if you do want to apply for phd<br>please do have a good look at<br>our website and make sure you send all<br>of the documents required<br>um and that you really spend a lot of<br>time in your application and make it the<br>best that it can be<br>we do have scholarships for this program<br>and which will cover<br>all tuition fees and living costs but<br>these would be for<br>exceptional students and students whose<br>um research interests very<br>closely match our interests and<br>expertise<br>so um for phd we have three assessment<br>points per year<br>um the end of january end of may and end<br>of september<br>so if you apply now for phd then your<br>application will be assessed after the<br>30th of september<br>and your result will come through about<br>two months<br>and for students who don't meet our<br>entry requirements um<br>then they may study at waikato pathways<br>college<br>so um the pathways college offers<br>english language programs<br>and foundation programs um so<br>students who don't meet our requirements<br>to enter<br>directly into a bachelor's degree may<br>study a foundation<br>and students who don't meet our english<br>language requirements may study<br>english language and so the pathways<br>college is on campus<br>with small class sizes a very supportive<br>environment<br>and a great place to study maybe if<br>you've never lived away from home before<br>um and uh you know students who are<br>looking to to go into that degree level<br>study<br>and are able to live on campus and<br>really have that um<br>tailored support that they need<br>and so you can see um these are the<br>levels of academic english<br>and that you can study at the pathways<br>college each level is equivalent to<br>a 0.5 increase in<br>ielts so for example if you have<br>ielts of six and then you may study for<br>10 weeks to increase your ielts to 6.5<br>and we do have a number of scholarships<br>um<br>as well so um you can see here um the<br>international excellence scholarship is<br>the most<br>important um maybe for international<br>students this one<br>gives you a 10 000 new zealand dollar<br>tuition fee reduction<br>and is based on academic merit so when<br>you apply for your<br>um degree then you can also apply for<br>the international excellence scholarship<br>we will assess your application and your<br>statement<br>and if you have um strong
