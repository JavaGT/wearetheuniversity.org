behalf of the<br>university i would like to begin<br>by extending a particularly warm welcome<br>to members of rhiannon's family who are<br>here today<br>her husband harry her children cam<br>and ash and her mom marilyn who have<br>joined us<br>you are very very welcome to be here<br>namihinui<br>i'd also like to acknowledge all of the<br>staff and students from across the<br>university and as i look out on the<br>audience i can see people<br>from all four of our academic divisions<br>and it's fantastic to have you here<br>joining us in the celebration<br>of rhiannon's success and in addition to<br>folks from the university<br>i also note members of our wider dunedin<br>community who often use<br>these lectures as an opportunity for<br>their own ongoing<br>learning and development and as always<br>you are very very welcome to be here<br>and last but not least i would like to<br>give a very warm welcome to our<br>chancellor dr royden somerville<br>who religiously takes time out of his<br>very busy day<br>to join us for these very special<br>occasions<br>now these inaugural professorial<br>lectures are a time of immense<br>celebration for<br>the university of otago and i am<br>absolutely delighted to see so many<br>people here<br>we should all take a moment and reflect<br>on the fact that these kinds of lectures<br>are actually rare<br>around the world right now and it's<br>wonderful that we can all come together<br>for a time of fellowship and learning<br>around the celebration of rhiannon's<br>success<br>now after everything that we've been<br>through this year it is fantastic for us<br>to have the opportunity to come together<br>and tonight is particularly special for<br>me<br>because today actually marks my ninth<br>year anniversary of being the vice<br>chancellor here at the university of<br>otago<br>so thank you rhiannon for throwing this<br>very large party<br>now as you will learn from rhiannon's<br>lecture this evening<br>she is an award-winning teacher a<br>popular postgraduate supervisor and<br>a highly successful researcher she has<br>also provided<br>exceptional and selfless service to her<br>discipline<br>to her school to the university and to<br>her profession<br>rhiannon on behalf of the university it<br>gives me great pleasure to congratulate<br>you on your very very well earned<br>promotion to professor<br>i'm very much looking forward to your<br>lecture this evening<br>i will now call on the head of<br>department of the department of<br>preventive and social medicine associate<br>professor patricia priest<br>who is going to tell us just a little<br>bit more about rhiannon's journey to<br>professor<br>tina koto um i'm privileged to<br>introduce professor ian and braund and<br>i'm going to say professor braund quite<br>often<br>because it's um so exciting rhian braund<br>commenced her university of otago<br>experience with a degree in biochemistry<br>moving on to a second degree in pharmacy<br>and qualifying as a registered<br>pharmacist in 2003.<br>she was a practicing pharmacist for a<br>few years before commencing an<br>electorating position<br>at the university of otago at the school<br>of pharmacy<br>she rose through the academic ranks to<br>become an associate professor in<br>clinical pharmacy in 2014.<br>two years ago we were delighted to<br>welcome her to the department of<br>preventive and social medicine when she<br>took up a position in the new zealand<br>pharmacovigilance centre<br>professor braun's talk is called<br>medications in aotearoa in new zealand<br>access excess and outcomes which nicely<br>summarises the breadth of her research<br>her work has a strong focus on equity<br>includes consideration of patient<br>behaviors regarding adherence and<br>medication<br>wastage for those of you not from the<br>university<br>i want to just re-mention what<br>professor hain said which is that<br>promotion to professor<br>is based on competence across the three<br>components of academic work not just<br>research but also teaching<br>and what we call service professor braun<br>is a highly successful teacher and her<br>passion for pharmacy and student success<br>was recognised in 2012<br>when she was awarded the prime<br>minister's award for tertiary teaching<br>excellence<br>in terms of service professor braun's<br>expertise has been recognised across<br>many areas<br>her research into advanced roles for<br>pharmacists and support staff<br>has resulted in multiple practice<br>changes and new models of care both<br>locally and internationally<br>her professional recognitions include<br>fellowships of both new zealand college<br>and the pharmaceutical society of new<br>zealand<br>and she holds national leadership roles<br>to enhance the use of medications<br>and improve patient access and outcomes<br>through better utilization of<br>pharmacists the talk we're about to hear<br>will include discussion about how<br>policies on access to medicines in new<br>zealand<br>along with patient behaviour can lead to<br>excess medication stockpiles and<br>medication wastage<br>and the many outcomes of that wastage<br>including financial clinical and<br>environmental<br>in finishing her lecture professor braun<br>will bring it all together by<br>emphasizing the relationship between<br>research and teaching<br>and how the authenticity of research<br>informed teaching can advance<br>professional practice<br>i know that professor braun has chosen<br>to highlight work that makes her proud<br>rather than necessarily just that that<br>has the so-called<br>metrics of success and that much of this<br>work is in collaboration with others<br>making the world a better place truly<br>requires good collaboration<br>and i want to congratulate professor<br>braund on her achievements and working<br>with others as well as personally<br>meeting the criteria for professor<br>i'm proud now to hand over to professor<br>ianna braund to deliver her<br>screen hello thank you so much for<br>taking the time coming to this um<br>talk of mine tonight um i really want to<br>start off by saying that actually this<br>lecture tonight<br>today is really um while it's a<br>professional personal milestone for me<br>it's really an opportunity for me to<br>thank the people that i've worked with<br>that i've worked with that have worked<br>with me<br>and some of the contributions that we've<br>made and the way that medicines are used<br>and accessed within new zealand during<br>this presentation i particularly want to<br>recognise and acknowledge those who've<br>walked with me on this journey<br>and those who continue to challenge to<br>inspire and motivate me<br>to make a difference and to people's<br>wellness<br>as was mentioned earlier i've decided to<br>focus on a few projects that really make<br>me proud these are the ones that i feel<br>contributed um in in far-reaching ways<br>i wanted to start off with um a favorite<br>what is the most important thing in the<br>world it is people<br>it is people it is people this is one of<br>the things that i really have strived<br>to to remember to hold on to in the<br>research journey that i've been on<br>the things that we do the way that we<br>conduct ourselves the way that we choose<br>to<br>integrate and interact with the world<br>people should always remain at the<br>i thought that um i would talk a little<br>bit about the way<br>medicines are accessed in new zealand<br>definitely talk about excess and we'll<br>definitely talk about outcomes today<br>um and i'm aware in this audience we've<br>got a diverse<br>range of knowledge of this area so i<br>really wanted to step back and set the<br>scene<br>there was a strong policy document that<br>came out from the ministry of health and<br>it was implementing medicines new<br>zealand<br>and one of the key messages through this<br>was that medicines remain<br>the most common health interventions and<br>this is irrespective of clinical area<br>as a pharmacist i'm a very proud<br>pharmacist<br>we know that pharmacists have particular<br>skills and their expertise<br>medicines experts okay it doesn't mean<br>that we are necessarily the most amazing<br>clinicians it's not our job<br>but we do know a lot about medicines we<br>know when to use them and when not to<br>use them<br>and how to use them safely and<br>effectively<br>the other thing that comes with being a<br>pharmacist is our location in our place<br>in the health system<br>pharmacists continue to be one of the<br>most accessible health professionals<br>mainly for several reasons including the<br>fact that there's<br>no need for scheduling there's lower<br>cost when you come and see a pharmacist<br>you can get advice for free<br>we also tend to have more locations and<br>we tend to be open<br>longer longer hours and so we continue<br>to play a really key role in primary<br>care<br>but i do want to just talk about<br>medicines as having the potential for<br>harm<br>so we think about medicines as being you<br>know safe and most of the time they are<br>but they do have a potential for harm so<br>we need to use a little bit of caution<br>when we choose to use medicines<br>one of the areas i'm going to talk about<br>in this lecture is reclassification<br>and that's a way of increasing access so<br>i thought i'd just walk us through<br>how classification of medicines works in<br>new zealand<br>so we have different levels of<br>classification which are based on<br>the access that is required and balanced<br>against the safety needs<br>we medicines that may be potentially<br>more dangerous might need a little bit<br>more closer monitoring<br>many of you will be familiar with<br>paracetamol being a general sale<br>medicine<br>this medicine can be bought from many<br>locations the warehouse the dairy<br>supermarket<br>okay where they put the safety<br>constraints is around smaller pack sizes<br>pharmacy only is the next level of care<br>or the next<br>parameter i guess the next layer out<br>about how we access medicines and so<br>pharmacy only are medicines that you can<br>buy at a pharmacy<br>you can be sold to by the front of shop<br>staff but again<br>there are restrictions about what these<br>medicines are and so paracetamol again<br>sits in there but this is when you start<br>looking at your larger pack sizes<br>liquid paracetamol is pharmacy only so<br>we have another layer of care in there<br>um not all countries around the world<br>have have this classification which is<br>pharmacist only<br>so these are medicines that can be sold<br>by a pharmacist<br>um currently one of the examples i've<br>got on here is paracetamol and low-dose<br>codeine that's about to change but there<br>are<br>medicines that are in that range of<br>pharmacists only medicines<br>one of the things that was introduced in<br>new zealand and i will talk about i'm a<br>pioneer<br>colleague friend of mine dr natalie gold<br>and we have the idea of having these<br>particular medicines that can only be<br>supplied by<br>a qualified or accredited pharmacist<br>one of the nice examples in there is the<br>emergency contraceptive pill<br>so you can get that from a pharmacy and<br>the reason that that's important is that<br>if you need to access that<br>outside of normal general practice hours<br>then you can you can go to your pharmacy<br>it's convenient for the patients<br>but only accredited pharmacists can<br>supply this so not every pharmacist<br>you have to have going through specific<br>training to make sure that you're<br>you know competent well-versed and can<br>have those kind of consultations<br>most of you will be familiar with<br>prescription-only medicine so they come<br>from prescriber<br>and again we've got another layer of<br>control which is around our controlled<br>drugs<br>i will talk a little bit about farming<br>and i think sometimes new zealanders<br>don't really appreciate how<br>helpful vital crucial pharmac is for our<br>medicine's access in new zealand<br>we have a pharmac which is government<br>agency<br>and they are the drug purchasing agency<br>so they buy the medicines and the way<br>that we get the best<br>deals because we only have a finite<br>pocket<br>you know bucket of money is through<br>negotiating and tenders<br>and one of the other mechanisms they use<br>cell supply means that they pick one<br>brand and that brand has<br>in new zealand we generally have<br>prescriptions that are ridden for three<br>months<br>there are some exceptions such as the<br>oral contraceptive pill<br>um and pharmac manages the way this is<br>controlled they write their scripts for<br>three months but<br>there can be smaller amounts in certain<br>criteria<br>in new zealand we have what's called a<br>fully funded medicine<br>and this is really important for us to<br>understand what that means it doesn't<br>mean that it's free<br>and this is one of the things that's<br>really important in the new zealand<br>context is<br>actually nothing in healthcare is free<br>everything has a cost<br>but it's about where that cost sits<br>so when a medicine is fully funded by<br>pharmac it doesn't mean it's free<br>it means that the government is paying a<br>proportion or the largest proportion of<br>that cost usually<br>and there's a part charge which is a tax<br>and that's where the patient pays five<br>dollars<br>there are again some exceptions to there<br>one of the things that sometimes gets<br>overlooked is when a family reaches<br>20 items that tax is removed and then<br>they become<br>free and free to the to the person for<br>that family for the rest of the year<br>this is incredibly affordable compared<br>to<br>many other countries in the world<br>doesn't always feel affordable but it<br>but it is comparatively<br>um and so this is important because one<br>of the things that<br>we spend a lot of time working and<br>looking at i'll skip through this<br>scheduling one is about how we increase<br>access<br>without leading to these sort of images<br>medicines wastage and medicines excess<br>and what we found in a lot of the work<br>we did so in 2003<br>pharmac introduced stat dispensing all<br>at once dispensing so patients got three<br>months of their medicines all at once<br>what happened though is that in that<br>first couple of weeks of a new medicine<br>where there's dose<br>translations or side effects people then<br>change medicines<br>and so we had two months or two and a<br>half months of medicines left over<br>and this was quite concerning uh<br>definitely for me<br>um when we think about access we think<br>about people that can't afford to get<br>their medicines for themselves or their<br>families<br>and then we start seeing buckets of<br>medicines coming back<br>we realize that there's something in the<br>system that is not<br>it's not balancing out um and we've seen<br>some of the volumes that come back home<br>and that have been<br>destroyed and we'll talk a little bit<br>this was a result of one of the studies<br>which looked at why people had medicines<br>that hadn't been used<br>past expiry date the treatments changed<br>the condition resolved<br>and so there's a whole lot of different<br>reasons why medicines get left over<br>but one of the things that's really<br>important to think about as<br>people come back to this people and when<br>we understand<br>patient behaviour and understand why<br>these medicines get left over<br>we can start to think about a system<br>that maybe<br>promotes equity and equivalent access<br>across different areas<br>so these two bright shining faces<br>hopefully some of you know professor<br>pauline norris and dr<br>james green um and we've spent a lot of<br>time<br>thinking about the patient so we think<br>about the medicine as being accessible<br>it's here it says products<br>but why don't people use it why do we<br>have leftover why do we have wastage<br>pauline by background is a sociologist<br>and she's an incredibly talented<br>researcher particularly in the<br>access space james green is a health<br>psychologist so<br>psychologist by background and so it's<br>really nice working with<br>non-pharmacists because they bring that<br>much bigger perspective<br>so we started to look a little bit about<br>health access<br>so why do people or how do people access<br>the system<br>we talked about the pharmac model and<br>that's really important because that's<br>where the money sits but actually access<br>isn't just about money and we'll talk a<br>little bit further on about some of<br>pharmax policies around increase<br>increasing access equity<br>because money is only one part of the<br>problem<br>people are human we make choices we make<br>decisions<br>and all of us have health beliefs and so<br>those will influence the way that these<br>medicines are used<br>so a doctor might prescribe a patient<br>might collect the medicines<br>and then they might not take them<br>depending on on these health beliefs<br>so those things all matter health<br>literacy is really important<br>and for those in the audience have gone<br>to university and trained in this<br>we sometimes forget that actually things<br>that we think are obvious<br>are really not that obvious um and you<br>know i remember talking to the students<br>a couple of years ago about asthma<br>inhalers and every year there's a huge<br>number of people that choke<br>on their asthma inhaler because no one's<br>ever told them to take the cap off<br>so they're puffing away on these<br>inhalers and things that we think you<br>know<br>are logical and aren't always obvious<br>when you when you come from a different<br>different world view and understanding<br>adherence<br>so why people take medicines why we<br>don't take medicines why we forget<br>you know we all have have busy schedules<br>busy lives so we don't always take our<br>medicines<br>the way that they are intended i just<br>want to pause just really quickly here<br>because<br>there's a phrase that is really<br>important to me medications only work<br>in those who take them and it's quite<br>interesting i did as as patricia<br>said i started off in the biochemistry<br>world and i came to pharmacy because i<br>was convinced that i was going to<br>create these amazing molecules i knew<br>all about protein structures i was going<br>to do mid-chem i was going to have all<br>these amazing new<br>creations and i fell into pharmacy and<br>realized that actually<br>it doesn't really matter which of these<br>amazing formulations you have and there<br>are some amazing formulation scientists<br>that i know personally<br>if the patient doesn't take them then<br>they're actually worthless anyway<br>and so it's understanding those two<br>things together that<br>clinical appropriateness the the the<br>drug entity<br>the formulation and then actually<br>understanding people um is where the<br>the real value comes in<br>um i mentioned uh two two of the lovely<br>people that i worked with<br>so there's another two professor steve<br>duffel and our phd student jill<br>and this was taking a different approach<br>at that same<br>sort of idea so whether work with<br>pauline and james had really thought<br>about an individual<br>this work was about populations and this<br>is an incredibly complex diagram<br>and um but one of the things<br>what i'll go through relatively slowly<br>so<br>on the vertical axis it's about your<br>percentage adherence so how many times<br>you actually take the medicine when<br>you're supposed to<br>across that sort of slanting down one is<br>your age and bands of 20 years<br>and then to add to complexity as a<br>dosing regime<br>so what this graph shows us is that if<br>you're a 20 year old<br>and if you have a dosing schedule of one<br>tablet a day<br>you're likely to only get 20 adherence<br>okay and that if you're over 60<br>on a one dose a day you're much closer<br>to a hundred percent<br>what's interesting again is that the<br>more um doses you have to take per day<br>the worse you are okay so the so so<br>relatively you know common sense the<br>more you have to remember<br>um the more times you have to do it the<br>less likely it is that you will<br>this was really interesting this work<br>because a lot of our adherent services a<br>lot of our support for medicines<br>are geared around that older age group<br>and actually<br>most of them are really well under<br>control and the reason they're under<br>control is that<br>um it's a beautiful piece of work that i<br>think pauline and june<br>june taught after which was saying that<br>it's routine<br>they have a routine it's with their cup<br>of tea they have blister packs and<br>actually a lot of them are quite well<br>supported in that space and we really<br>need to think about the way we<br>support good medicines use is really in<br>that middle bracket<br>around those people that have got these<br>busy lives that have got other<br>commitments where actually it's not such<br>a priority<br>so that was quite a cool piece of work<br>that we did<br>one of the other aspects of that work is<br>about<br>forgiving drugs so these are drugs that<br>if you're actually not as good as you're<br>supposed to be<br>the drugs don't mind so they'll still<br>work as well<br>so one of the least forgiving drugs um<br>is the oral contraceptive pill<br>um you miss that by by a matter of hours<br>and you know you could be in trouble<br>whereas aspirin you can actually take<br>aspirin<br>once a week because of the way that it<br>works so the idea is thinking<br>if we know that patients aren't going to<br>do everything perfectly all the time<br>can we think about a drug that basically<br>gives a bit of latitude and um<br>so we've done some some really cool<br>one of the things i wanted to highlight<br>is about um the<br>at about the impacts on outcomes and<br>again another a nice a busy graph and<br>i'll walk you through<br>it we did some work<br>with the babe up in the bay of plenty<br>and looking at diabetic medicines<br>and what this graph is saying is that so<br>hba1c is a marker of how well controlled<br>your<br>diabetes is by by looking at the amount<br>of glucose that's attached to your blood<br>cells<br>so where this patient's had a score so<br>an mu<br>score is a specific service that's<br>provided by pharmacists<br>where they had a score of one or two<br>their control so one or two was not very<br>good control not very good adherence<br>their blood sugars kept getting worse<br>over time whereas when they got to three<br>and four<br>you can see that their blood sugars<br>became better controlled<br>and what this sort of says to us is that<br>you don't have to be perfect<br>so three was okay you didn't have to be<br>perfect but you can't be<br>in that range where you're starting to<br>skip doses and this has real impact<br>when we did a lot of the work around<br>medicine's wastage we were quite<br>concerned about antibiotics<br>and the reasons for that if you think<br>about<br>what we've talked about already patients<br>they don't take their antibiotics<br>regularly<br>then they can develop resistance then we<br>have<br>wasted antibiotics which have got to go<br>somewhere in the system<br>again it's another busy slide which i've<br>pinched from somewhere else<br>but really this is quite interesting<br>because the concept of one health and<br>the fact that<br>antibiotics that we use in the vet<br>sector<br>has implications in the ecology sector<br>there's a whole lot of interplay around<br>antibiotics<br>and i think this is really important for<br>us<br>as far as sustainability as far as the<br>environment<br>that everything we do goes somewhere and<br>it's quite interesting um<br>i spent a lot of time working with the<br>the deer<br>what was the deer program with the<br>police and the kids at school so we went<br>in school visits and talked about how to<br>use medicines<br>the kids at school get this they<br>understand that everything's connected<br>that when we flush something down the<br>toilet<br>or wash it down the sink that it goes<br>out to the sea they understand that<br>and so it's just really pulling that<br>back and reminding ourselves that<br>everything we do has consequences<br>that things don't just magically<br>disappear we never see them again<br>and so this was some work that barry pig<br>who was in chemistry<br>and our phd student alfred did over a<br>couple years<br>and alfred had the joyous job of going<br>out to the sewers treatment plant and<br>getting some of the wastewater out there<br>to start seeing what we were wasting<br>what was coming out in our<br>water and again really low levels but we<br>are seeing<br>seeing pharmaceuticals coming out even<br>through our wastewater systems here<br>because the systems aren't just set up<br>for them<br>um it was quite interesting i really<br>didn't want<br>today i wanted to talk about the<br>research i don't want to talk about the<br>metrics<br>but i did have a quick look today as you<br>killing time before this lecture um<br>at some of the metrics of this work and<br>one of the papers we published<br>was in a journal with an impact factor<br>about 7.5<br>it's been cited 250 times<br>and so this is as well as being<br>important<br>and for all of those reasons it actually<br>has metrics because<br>when you're working in a space that<br>thinks about the bigger picture people<br>are interested<br>and so as well as doing the right thing<br>because she did the right thing from the<br>academic from that metric space it's<br>really important too<br>i do want to give a shout out to one of<br>my friends and colleagues sandy barwin<br>and she's working at pharmac at the<br>moment<br>and the access and equity space and we<br>mentioned before that financial cost is<br>not the only barrier to access<br>and one of the the reasons is that to<br>obtain a prescription you need to go and<br>see a<br>doctor um and that means that there's a<br>part charge that means you need to make<br>a schedule that<br>there's a whole lot of um<br>system barriers around there that make<br>it really challenging<br>um one of the um approaches for about a<br>minute<br>is that a lot of people don't want to<br>make appointment times or appointment<br>times aren't when they want them they're<br>delayed and so a way of thinking about<br>how we increase<br>access is um what is best for the<br>patient so where can they access the<br>care they need at the right time<br>that is maybe not in the system that the<br>way that we think about it through this<br>doctor one<br>and so i'll bring you on to um one of my<br>my great friends so on the left hand<br>side there's dr natalie gould<br>and she's an internationally recognised<br>for with for<br>reclassification the lovely lady beside<br>her is alison van wyk<br>did i get that right anita funny um<br>who works at green cross health and<br>green cross health has um<br>pharmacies and medical centers and they<br>they look after you know the idea is to<br>advance clinical care<br>um so they won um several awards for<br>this work which was reclassifying<br>trying reclassifying trimethoprim um to<br>a pharmacist only medicine<br>now this is for acute urinary tract<br>infections uncomplicated<br>and the beauty of this whole process was<br>it put the patient first<br>and it said that actually when a patient<br>a female patient<br>because we actually excluded me and they<br>were a ferocious female patient comes in<br>with an acute uti<br>they usually don't want to wait two or<br>three days for an appointment they want<br>to pop in at their lunch time they want<br>to talk to someone they want to see if<br>they need to go and see a doctor<br>and the beauty of this one is that<br>trimethoprim if you understand the drug<br>it's a very simple dosing it's<br>one dose for three nights consecutively<br>nice simple dosing regime<br>um and what was interesting about this<br>idea of changing that narrative is that<br>the work that natalie and i did<br>following this up patience loved it<br>patients loved her many gps not all<br>um didn't love her and<br>again it's about changing that narrative<br>so there is a role in all of these<br>conversations<br>um for the medical doctors in here and<br>when this reclassification went through<br>it was with some really clear parameters<br>that actually there were certain ages so<br>you don't go over i think a 65<br>that if there's any consideration that<br>it could be some kidney infection it's<br>straight referral so it's really quite<br>tight parameters<br>and i think when the when the medical<br>team realized that actually this was<br>full clinical consult with those defined<br>parameters<br>um and then it meant the patient's got<br>access when they needed it there was<br>quite a quite a shift in there<br>what's been really cool though is that<br>um and this is about some of the<br>outreach about<br>why you do cool stuff with cool people<br>um is that currently we're working with<br>qut over in queensland<br>and queensland health want to implement<br>this they were hoping to implement it on<br>national women's day which was<br>mid-covered but but we're still working<br>with them to have this<br>as a pathway for for their female<br>patients<br>this one possibly a little bit more<br>controversial and exciting<br>um and again natalie and i worked on<br>this one<br>with douglas pharmaceuticals and the<br>idea was that could we make sildenafil<br>a pharmacist only medicine and everyone<br>goes well i would<br>one of the problems we were finding is<br>that many of our<br>male patients didn't want to make an<br>appointment they didn't want to have the<br>schedule<br>and and it was um a very last minute<br>we'll go in for an ear infection and as<br>we're walking out the door have these<br>these conversations the reason this one<br>was reclassified and quite successfully<br>reclassified<br>was because of the opportunity um here<br>so erectile dysfunction can also be a<br>indicative early cardiovascular disease<br>small vessel occlusion<br>and so when this went through the<br>reclassification process<br>the number one parameter that pharmacy<br>had to do was cardiovascular<br>risk assessment so we've got a<br>population of men who aren't going to<br>the gps anyway<br>that come into the pharmacy and we<br>perform a full cardiovascular risk<br>assessment<br>and with referral and again i'll show<br>you the form is incredibly<br>precise um and it's one of those<br>situations where<br>literally if someone's walking past the<br>pharmacy oh i'm gonna have that<br>conversation now they pop in<br>and then they can actually have a<br>clinical consult and be referred to<br>another slideshow will be hard to read<br>but what i wanted you to understand is<br>that this is<br>a quite a rigid process literally rigid<br>process that we go through<br>exclusion criteria we we you know<br>constrain the age bans we do a whole lot<br>of things to make sure that what we're<br>doing<br>um is safe for the patients what was<br>interesting in this graph that i've got<br>on the left hand side which natalie sent<br>through to me<br>this image is the counterfeit um drugs<br>or<br>coming through the border and so what we<br>see<br>the blue line is sildenafil and the red<br>lines are a similar product to daniel<br>so we did the reclassification in 2014<br>and what we can see is a number of<br>packets that were confiscated in the<br>border<br>sort of about 4 000 i think in the year<br>of 2014<br>but once we did the reclassification<br>that number dropped and that number<br>dropped because people were coming into<br>the pharmacy and had a different<br>legitimate source so<br>it's quite interesting and it made it<br>quite a normalization process<br>one of the things and i know there's<br>several gps in the audience<br>is that's really important to me is the<br>idea that this is not competition this<br>is about collaboration<br>and it's providing multiple points for a<br>patient to come into the system<br>and in the reclassifications that we've<br>worked on a couple of the ones that are<br>coming<br>coming online soon it's about giving<br>people<br>opportunities or options creating<br>multiple entry points into the into the<br>pathway<br>but we do want to work as a team and the<br>idea about<br>having shared records and those sort of<br>things are really important because<br>we end up in a situation where one<br>person has some information and someone<br>has other information<br>it's actually not in the patient's best<br>interest so thinking about those wrap<br>around thinking about those shared<br>records it's really it's not easy<br>and but it's really important um and<br>again this this mantra that came through<br>which is about for the patient it's<br>better sooner more convenient<br>trying to think about ways that we can<br>make it um<br>easier for patients excuse me<br>um this lovely lady is patty napier<br>doctor payton napier now<br>um and again you know the journey patty<br>took me when i was a pharmacy student<br>and then<br>several years later paddy came into the<br>phd with me<br>the cool thing about what patty and i<br>did<br>was around can we change the way<br>that we distribute our work flow<br>and one of the things that's really<br>important for pharmacists is that we end<br>up<br>unintentionally we have good intentions<br>of being out with our patients but we<br>end up at the dispensary<br>and there's a bit of a rhetoric around<br>the fact that we're tied to the<br>dispensary it's really hard to walk away<br>and have those conversations<br>and so what we did was we took a model<br>which is<br>implemented in the uk what's called a<br>checking technician<br>and we thought how do we make this<br>happen in new zealand<br>and the idea is that when a prescription<br>comes in<br>the pharmacist does the clinical<br>assessment they're looking to make sure<br>it's appropriate the doses look fine<br>they look at the patient record<br>but once we get to this part here this<br>technical mechanical part<br>of is that 10 milligrams is that 10<br>milligrams is that that is that there<br>that doesn't need the same level of<br>clinical expertise<br>so could we take what is effectively a<br>production on and slice it into chunks<br>where we had the best person doing that<br>part of the of the task of the of the<br>workflow<br>um and so we ended up actually got some<br>money eventually from health workforce<br>new zealand<br>to run a pilot um and it became quite<br>clear quite quickly that this was<br>actually<br>almost earth someone said no brain and<br>nothing's a no-brainer but<br>that the ability to allow pharmacists to<br>focus<br>on the cognitive aspect of the clinical<br>aspect<br>and then to allow other people that have<br>got much better attention to detail<br>to perform those tasks actually increase<br>safety<br>and there's a recent meta-analysis<br>that's come out and the countries that<br>have got this and they show there's<br>actually less dispensing errors<br>um because you've got the right people<br>doing the right part of the process<br>again we had to really socialize this um<br>because a lot of pharmacists don't like<br>um letting go maybe is the best way to<br>say it<br>the pharmacist wanted to own the whole<br>process and they want to be everywhere<br>and they<br>who's gonna who's gonna you know be<br>responsible and and because we're very<br>responsible people<br>um and so it's just about re-shifting<br>the way that whether we have this<br>this process um and again as i said<br>we're lucky so we ran a nationwide pilot<br>and it's being implemented now<br>i've made it sound really easy but but<br>it's these things never<br>are because there's law um there's<br>service specifications there's 101<br>hurdles<br>um but this is a really cool opportunity<br>um for taking<br>pharmacies support staff and giving them<br>a pathway for success too and allowing<br>them to flourish<br>while pharmacy and moving into a certain<br>i want to talk finish the talk about the<br>research aspect about where to<br>next and i think at least one or two of<br>this is one of the beauties of working<br>at this university is that there are a<br>lot of<br>a lot of bright people who want to do<br>really cool research for their patients<br>and so i've been fortunate enough to<br>work with with all of these clinicians<br>so some of you all know there's<br>association professor michael tatley got<br>dr sharon patterson<br>dr helen patterson not relation not<br>related<br>and professor michael schultz over there<br>oh often put him over the words<br>um because it doesn't matter what<br>clinical area you're in<br>the way that we use medicines the way<br>that we um have access to medicines what<br>patients do within medicines<br>if they don't get better because they're<br>not taking their medicines these are<br>ubiquitous across all of these clinical<br>areas<br>and this has been one of the true joys<br>for me has been working with other<br>clinicians who really want to<br>do the right thing for their patients um<br>you know and these are people look you<br>know michael's here<br>the work in the pharmacovigilance space<br>you know sharon who goes on these<br>these amazing walks to raise money for<br>her cause we've got<br>helen who has this um reproductive<br>health bus that she's set up in the<br>michael schultz i was thinking about him<br>and i sit on i'm currently said on<br>pharmax p-tech committee so i see the<br>letters that michael and his<br>uh clinician friends write to the<br>pharmax saying funded these for my<br>patients so<br>so it's really nice to work with people<br>that um that really want<br>this photo was taken in 2012<br>some of you may recognize that the<br>person in the<br>john key wasn't available when i got the<br>prime minister's award that night so<br>um and and this was a really again a<br>really special<br>um special um moment<br>i really really was because<br>we're an incredibly research intensive<br>university and that's something that is<br>really important and that i really love<br>sometimes<br>teaching feels like sort of the poor<br>cousin and i don't think it needs to be<br>that way i think that actually they both<br>can feed into each other and create um<br>much bigger opportunities and much<br>better outcomes for everyone<br>so i think research i've said here needs<br>an impact and<br>some of the research we do can take a<br>long time for impact but if we can<br>encourage our students to think about<br>what they're doing why they're doing it<br>how they can move things in a particular<br>direction<br>really important stuff and i think it<br>has much further reaching implications<br>sometimes when we realize<br>those opportunities to challenge and<br>critique and reflect about why<br>they why they're doing something could<br>it be done better those are actually<br>really important<br>aspects um and so that's really<br>my point that i really wanted to make on<br>this is that the idea to link the two<br>we talk about it and it's not always<br>easy but it's really important<br>and really needs to be acknowledged<br>i am i put this one and i'm being a<br>little bit cheeky because we talk about<br>these service roles and sometimes<br>service sounds like it's um appendance<br>um and i almost wanted to change the<br>narrative and say that it's actually<br>strengthening<br>these are opportunities that we have and<br>we're in a really<br>fortunate position and i don't mean just<br>because i've got my red gown on<br>i'm in a fortunate position because i<br>can take the knowledge that i have and i<br>can use that and i can inspire others<br>and i can make a difference to those<br>people that haven't come through the<br>same pathways as me<br>and i think that's the whole the point<br>that i wanted to hear is that this gift<br>of knowledge and influence should be<br>shared<br>and these are about strengthening the<br>bonds between the university and the<br>community<br>strengthening the expertise that's<br>available to these groups<br>and understanding research and teaching<br>and these are just some of the some of<br>the organizations that i've<br>provided um time and energy and my<br>family will tell you<br>nights away and wellington there's<br>always these wellington meetings<br>um and and it's because it's important<br>and i think that um<br>these are the things that we can do that<br>are actually really outside ourselves<br>and i'm just being cheeky and calling it<br>strengthening rather than service<br>because i think it strengthens both ways<br>there's a few people that i specifically<br>want to acknowledge<br>the university in its entirety is<br>something that's really important to me<br>and<br>and it was mentioned before i mean the<br>university is a part of my life now<br>what are we working on 25 years um you<br>know i came here<br>and did the health science route fell in<br>love with biochemistry<br>um and then of course from there fell in<br>love with pharmacy and<br>and at the time i did pharmacy this was<br>the only university<br>um and so so i've been very proud um to<br>be<br>to be part of this university oh my<br>sorry<br>my spacing's kind of been messed up but<br>that's all right one person i really<br>wanted to acknowledge was ian tucker<br>professor ian tucker and<br>he um was the person that when i was<br>finishing off my phd<br>said to me you've got an academic role<br>would you apply for it<br>and i think that ability that support<br>the opportunities that have come from<br>being part of this university<br>um are quite phenomenal um there's two<br>people on here and i i'm sorry that the<br>four meetings changed um to say to<br>professor michael tatley<br>um he's been um just a delight into<br>profession<br>sorry says professor patricia priest the<br>time that i've spent<br>um under pre-meds and the culture in the<br>in the<br>you know the real um vibrancy of these<br>units<br>is something that i'm really cherished<br>put a shout out there to the<br>pharmaceutical society of new zealand<br>um possibly a bit loaded i'm currently<br>the vice president of the society<br>but um but but well before that um the<br>reason i am the vice president is<br>because it's an organization that i<br>really believe in<br>um and they've done a lot of the work<br>and support around these<br>advancing pharmacy thinking about new<br>opportunities providing training and<br>support<br>um and trying to get pharmacy positioned<br>so that they're not seen as the poor<br>cousin<br>and that they actually are a legitimate<br>health professional that can provide<br>really good access and good clinical<br>support to the<br>to the whole healthcare team and again a<br>real shout out to all the collaborators<br>contributors and students um<br>i am going to go quickly down to the<br>personal sort of spot<br>um there's one person that i really who<br>can't be here that i really want to<br>acknowledge and that's my dad so my dad<br>passed away 2013. it must be<br>um so the reason it's important for me<br>to acknowledge my dad is that my dad was<br>a professional soccer player in england<br>and he came out to new zealand<br>on a contract with dunedin city football<br>club um and he met my mum<br>and um stayed so my dad<br>um for all his has was he cursed he had<br>three daughters<br>and so so this professional athlete and<br>there's three girls and<br>the thing that i remember the most about<br>my dad is that he told us we could do<br>anything we could be anything and he<br>really genuinely believed that there was<br>nothing<br>that you know the world couldn't offer<br>um and the opportunities were always<br>there<br>um so i'm the first in my family that<br>came to university<br>uh and i really put a lot of that down<br>to<br>to my dad and mom you know i love you<br>there was something about this this um<br>unwavering belief<br>that his girls could take on the world<br>it didn't matter and<br>so you know there's um<br>you know he's very overseas and dad is<br>very special<br>one of the things that happened to my<br>dad in 2011 2012<br>he had a quad bypass and he stroked on<br>the table um<br>and i remember the first time he he left<br>the house was um<br>and yes it must be really into 2012 was<br>when i<br>received their prime minister's award<br>and i remember the first time he left<br>the house was to come and meet the vice<br>chancellor<br>and about how special that was um and<br>you know so these are these are things<br>that really<br>make people who they are and really<br>drive us<br>so he's a big you know inspiration<br>and again these things wouldn't possibly<br>possible without these<br>those wonderful people who have shared<br>this journey with me and there's<br>many faces up there that you'll admit<br>that you'll recognize some of them have<br>been<br>overtly instrumental some more covertly<br>instrumental um<br>and i think that's again one of the the<br>joys of of being an academic<br>is that there are a lot of people um<br>who've got a lot of great ideas and want<br>to make a difference um to the little<br>corner of the world<br>and so i'm incredibly grateful and i<br>really think that's about where<br>tell my family i wouldn't acknowledge<br>them oh i'm sorry ashley<br>um oh well you know i've been incredibly<br>blessed my you know<br>the most fabulous family my husband who<br>is my best friend and um<br>you know again another another person<br>who believes<br>that you can be anything you want to be<br>just just go for it so um<br>thank you family thank you and thank you<br>for everyone that's taken the time to<br>come tonight<br>oh<br>truly delighted that i have attended<br>this lecture<br>congratulations rihanna<br>what she taught is outstanding<br>if i can summarize in a few words<br>she taught us about new zealand<br>medication classification<br>she told us how lucky we are<br>in new zealand to have fully funded<br>medications<br>that pays co-pays five dollars<br>kept at hundred dollars per family<br>i left new zealand 15 years ago to<br>and returned this year and i know how<br>lucky<br>then she went on to teach us<br>sometimes that privilege<br>and luckiness can lead to waste<br>and how human behavior leads<br>attracted by this concept of<br>reclassifying<br>drugs in a controlled<br>and systematic manner if you deployed<br>at a point of care in pharmacies<br>how valuable that is for primary care<br>i just want to finish a quote that i<br>took<br>do the right thing and measure the right<br>metrics<br>and we want to thank raynon<br>all of you attending this lecture<br>and on behalf of the<br>university of otago and otago medical<br>school and the department of<br>preventive and social medicine i wanted<br>to<br>give her a small gift<br>my name is paul brunson and i have the<br>privilege to be the pro vice chancellor<br>for health sciences<br>and i have two duties tonight and the<br>first one is to thank you the audience<br>for attending this evening<br>these are important academic events<br>within the university<br>and as the vice chancellor has already<br>mentioned we're enjoying freedoms that<br>are not being enjoyed elsewhere in the<br>world<br>that allow us to come together tonight<br>and i think this is the first post<br>lockdown ipl the second sorry<br>um so it's we should recognize that<br>so thank you for joining us this evening<br>you're very welcome<br>and my final duty is to invite you to<br>join us for some light refreshments in<br>the staff club<br>and if you follow the walking bus you'll<br>find the destination<br>and please continue the conversations<br>indeed</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
