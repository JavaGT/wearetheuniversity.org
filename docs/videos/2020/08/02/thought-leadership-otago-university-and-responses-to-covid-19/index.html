tuning in today<br>um i'm jonathan wong and uh i'm the<br>current president of the auoa<br>which is the otago alumni organization<br>based in the united states here<br>um a quick plug for our group here uh<br>you know we are a non-profit based<br>alumni organization that's dedicated to<br>supporting<br>each other that is otago alumni and also<br>providing a<br>vehicle for a u.s based alumni to<br>contribute financially to the university<br>of otago<br>i want to want to provide a huge thank<br>you to both miguel and james<br>today for uh for their time and insights<br>i'm very very excited for this webinar<br>and also to our moderators phil and kath<br>uh who are both<br>board members of the auoa so with that<br>let me hand off to<br>sheila murray who is the director of<br>development and alumni<br>relations for the university of otago<br>thanks donna<br>hi everybody welcome from a cold winter<br>stay in denver<br>i must say it is a bit warmer today than<br>it has been um i'd just like to<br>um thank um ayua for um<br>helping to organise this what we've been<br>here today and certainly james and<br>mcguild who are part of the university<br>staff here<br>we certainly look forward to working<br>more clarity with you guys<br>on setting things up and moving these<br>more forward um so i hope it all goes<br>well<br>and um thanks to a couple of my team<br>members danella and laura<br>helping get this put together today<br>good afternoon everyone i'm phil graham<br>i've lived in the u.s 35 years and<br>worked in the pharmaceutical industry<br>for 30 of those years<br>currently i'm at a small company in the<br>greater boston area<br>and you see behind me a view of boston<br>from the prudential center for people<br>who<br>you know the the city i recently joined<br>the board of the aua after attending an<br>event at the new zealand embassy in<br>washington dc last<br>fall where i very much enjoyed meeting<br>the chancellor vice chancellor<br>founding members of the a aui auoa<br>as well as a number of other alumni<br>through this event and others like<br>where hope main can connect american<br>alumni<br>and with the university today we have<br>presentations from two researchers at<br>otago related to the defining topic of<br>our time<br>the covert 19 pandemic after both<br>presentations are complete we will have<br>a question and answer session moderated<br>by dr kath ballard professor of<br>pediatrics<br>microbiology immunology and tropical<br>medicine at children's national medical<br>center<br>in washington dc you may ask questions<br>at any time via<br>the q a function which you can access by<br>moving the mouse to the bottom of the<br>screen<br>we expect to finish at 7 pm east eastern<br>time 4 p.m on the west coast<br>in the event we cannot get to all the<br>questions at the end of the hour we will<br>send them along to the presenters for an<br>email response<br>which will include which we will include<br>in a follow-up email<br>along with a link to the recording of<br>this section<br>session our first speaker is professor<br>miguel quinones mateo<br>who holds the webster family<br>viral pathogenesis of the department of<br>microbiology<br>and immunology he has over 25 years of<br>research experience in the virology<br>field and has authored over 100<br>peer-reviewed publications<br>nine book chapters and more than 190<br>abstracts<br>for scientific meetings today he'll be<br>talking about covert 19 research<br>make a otago for the introduction let me<br>see if i can do these<br>um sure<br>and i'm gonna make these<br>i hope that that's okay and then<br>everybody's seeing the the first slide<br>uh so first thank you for the organizer<br>for the invitation and thank you for the<br>university of otago alumni association<br>for<br>you know attending today uh it's been a<br>pleasure<br>um a quick background um<br>maureen from venezuela moved to spain to<br>do my phd<br>moved to the us for many years and i've<br>been here in new zealand<br>for the last almost 18 months now and<br>the plan was to start working with<br>emergent viruses that could be relevant<br>for for new zealand<br>and i couldn't even imagine ever in my<br>wildest dream that i was going to be in<br>the middle of an outbreak and a pandemic<br>like the one that we have right now so<br>today in the next you know 18 to 20<br>minutes until i'm going to tell you a<br>little bit about the story<br>and how we start working with these<br>vitals<br>and what we have been doing for the last<br>you know three or four<br>actually five five months so i kind of<br>start without<br>uh talking a little bit about the the<br>give you an update about kobe 19 i mean<br>everybody's familiar with this john<br>hopkins<br>uh a little map and as of yesterday<br>we're<br>approaching 15 million people infected<br>uh<br>at least detected that have been<br>infected with these vitals<br>and unfortunately we have uh roughly you<br>know<br>600 000 people that have died and these<br>numbers keep increasing<br>every day which is really really sad<br>so fortunately for us in new zealand and<br>from other countries<br>around the globe but mainly here in new<br>zealand we were able as a country<br>able to control the pandemic uh on their<br>break<br>uh with a minimum number of you know<br>total confirmed cases roughly 1500<br>and then a really really limited number<br>of people have died unfortunately 22 of<br>them<br>uh that's not a case for many other<br>countries including the us as you can<br>see here<br>um brazil south africa<br>india you know even russia this keeps<br>increasing and increasing so<br>we're desperately needed something to to<br>to fight back and<br>i'm talking about vaccines of<br>antibiotics so about how we started here<br>in new zealand is it's a you know it's<br>kind of a funny story to be honest that<br>was actually video<br>um on vacation with my family with my<br>daughter and<br>wife and then somebody told me i think<br>one of them told me to say have you seen<br>what's going on in china<br>uh and and then right away i said well<br>this this doesn't look that good i mean<br>hopefully they're going to be able to<br>contain it<br>so we went back to the meeting and and i<br>think it was the same week that we came<br>back<br>next week but james came to my office<br>and<br>with the same question he said miguel<br>have you seen what was going on in china<br>do you think that we should be ready for<br>this<br>uh james knowing that that has some<br>background on<br>you know molecular uh developing<br>molecular diagnostic<br>kids and assays so i i agree<br>we decided at that point this is<br>mid-january that we should be<br>you know looking around and see what we<br>can do to be ready<br>in case that virus escape but i think at<br>that point<br>there was even one case in australia or<br>something like that<br>so quickly we decided that we didn't<br>want to reinvent the wheel<br>and let's see what other people were<br>doing out there and<br>try to adapt and implement an asset that<br>we could run<br>here in the meeting and be ready like i<br>said so we found these<br>this group in germany that online they<br>have developed these tests<br>uh basically a quantitative real-time<br>pcr to diagnose uh<br>infectiousness chronovirus too that at<br>the time was called human<br>uh wuhan coronavirus so anyway we<br>ordered the primers<br>of course we didn't have any positive<br>control so we needed to order plasmid<br>you know synthetic genes and we ordered<br>for the e-gene and the<br>polymerase of the vitals so this is you<br>know<br>the last week of january 2020.<br>so we got everything in the week here in<br>my lab and we started you know<br>working on the essay being sure that you<br>know that it worked like that<br>the german group would say that it was<br>gonna work and this was a the work of<br>one of my you know postdocs here in the<br>in the in my group and blair and dr<br>blair lovely<br>so blair did an amazing job and putting<br>all these together testing<br>you know checking the sensitivity and<br>specificity and so on of the other of<br>these i said it was<br>working really well and at that point<br>then we engaged with uh<br>james group and the meeting hospital<br>with dr jenny grant<br>and we started you know implementing the<br>assay in the hospital<br>using the panther homologics which is<br>one of these massive intros<br>in intro instruments um<br>that you know you do all these testing<br>basically automatically<br>get the sample into our extraction pcr<br>and you know speech out the result at<br>the end<br>so the idea was to you know take these<br>in-house and implement it in the<br>hospital<br>like that so blair and jenny work really<br>hard for the next you know<br>three or four weeks putting all these<br>together uh we tested of course<br>reproducibility of the assay it was<br>way more sensitive for the eg for the<br>rdrp uh and i'm sorry i think that<br>that's my phone that is ringing and i'm<br>gonna unplug it<br>this is live tv uh so the<br>reproducibility was really<br>really good um we tested of course that<br>you know what we were the data that we<br>got in a hospital was similar to the one<br>that we were getting here in-house<br>and it was working really really well um<br>so at that point<br>uh everything was set up they went live<br>in the hospital<br>uh that day march march the 13th<br>and james and jane were able to detect<br>the first case<br>in the media actually of you know<br>scotland to attack that person<br>and i think if i remember correctly was<br>the eighth person in new zealand<br>the other ones have been detected in<br>oakland so we were as you can imagine<br>you know a mixture of worry but of<br>course excited about you know that we<br>were ready i mean<br>that conversation that started six weeks<br>before uh<br>paid off um so jenny<br>and james continue working on these we<br>sent or they sent samples to other<br>you know institutions across the country<br>just to be sure that our housing that we<br>put together was working like supposed<br>to<br>100 concordance everything went fine<br>uh so since that day uh they have been<br>running that taste in the hospital and<br>have been monitoring these<br>uh outbreaks and they making the south<br>island using that test<br>which is really cool so i'm gonna tell<br>you uh<br>what we did or the the kind of you know<br>numbers that we got for the first month<br>after<br>the essay went live as of you know the<br>10th of april<br>we had at that point a little bit more<br>than 1000 cases in<br>in new zealand and roughly 200 of them<br>were in the southern districts<br>including of course the media in<br>queenstown<br>all of them if i remember correctly most<br>of them if not all of them were you know<br>detected using<br>our tests um and regarding the<br>demographics of people that we were<br>tested um roughly you know 400 or 4 700<br>people have been tested but by the 10th<br>of april um you know<br>kind of half and half between male and<br>female and then the age group basically<br>reflects you know the demographics of<br>the media<br>definitely the southern ireland uh 190<br>of those<br>4700 were positive for copy 19 uh again<br>roughly you know 52 to 47<br>uh female to male and as you can see<br>here these reflect the demographics of<br>dunedin and<br>mainly students and you know a little<br>bit of older people like me here<br>in indonesia not a big statistical<br>significant difference between male and<br>female<br>and so on so because of the<br>holologics that panther holologix was<br>able to do sars and other respiratory<br>viruses and<br>jenny and james were testing for other<br>vitals as well<br>and now at least at that point as of the<br>10th of april<br>none of the viruses or the samples that<br>were posted for<br>such coronavirus were positive for any<br>other respiratory vitals and<br>in that instrument 54 of the ones that<br>were negative for tsars were positive<br>for other viruses mainly influenza but<br>the other vital since the typical<br>respiratory viruses of the season as<br>well<br>and the majority of them were negative<br>for stars and for the other respiratory<br>viruses as well<br>okay but that was great we developed<br>their essay<br>it was working really well and so when<br>when we got it i got a phone call from<br>james saying that we got the first test<br>that name the first positive test that's<br>okay we need a sequence let's sequence<br>that right away i mean we just need to<br>verify that that<br>would see this is supposed to be easy so<br>we got that sample that same day and it<br>with the help of<br>dr joe stanton and the department of<br>nationally here in<br>university of ottawa jackson trees we<br>processed that sample using the median<br>hog for nanopore and you know basically<br>a day<br>later we got the data out we sequence<br>the full genome of the virus<br>and and it was positive of course it was<br>sars corona biostate so the asset was<br>working well we were able to identify<br>the first<br>providers here in new zealand um<br>but using sequencing we got i think that<br>was the same there the next day the<br>second case<br>uh so i decided to you know verify that<br>using the mysqq and<br>with the help again in the department of<br>value chemistry and player<br>and my group but we sequenced that in<br>using the mystique illumina<br>as no surprise you know positive as well<br>for south carolina by just to the full<br>genome as well<br>and of course when we do the apologetic<br>tree it was you know<br>verified it was of course coronavirus 2<br>and not anything else so<br>at that point uh we were really excited<br>and everything was working<br>but of course we the the country is<br>starting to go into lockdown<br>uh level one two three and four<br>eventually<br>so by the end of march we went into new<br>zealand<br>to level four lockdown so everybody went<br>home as you may remember<br>um and i have to see and i hate to talk<br>about me but<br>in first person but i saw these other as<br>an opportunities okay i'm a biologist<br>i'm supposed to be working in american<br>viruses we cannot go home we need to<br>keep this going<br>so i started talking with you know<br>everybody here in the university and<br>but at the time that everybody closed i<br>mean<br>all any other university in the country<br>closed and all the researchers went to<br>stock<br>uh with the support of everybody from<br>the vc from harleen<br>uh from pvc for paul browntown and you<br>know the dean brian and then<br>great cook everybody was supportive and<br>i said yeah miguel do you need to keep<br>going and we need to keep working with<br>these fighters<br>so we went to talk about all the you<br>know guidelines regulations and<br>everything and we kept at my lab and two<br>post docs<br>uh blair and ambrodial i'll mention more<br>about world in a second<br>and since we have a pc3 lab you know<br>physical containment 3 laboratory i<br>decided that okay we need the next step<br>is pcr sequencing now we need to isolate<br>devices everybody was doing it so we<br>really had to do it as well uh so at<br>that point we<br>took um a bunch of different examples<br>from from<br>james in the hospital mainly uh these<br>are<br>indian swaps and we took those and<br>infected or<br>exposed the viewer cells to these<br>samples and we got seven viruses<br>and as you can imagine that first week<br>or ten days of doing this we were all<br>very excited<br>waiting to see if this was going to<br>happen and we got some cpes<br>have a body effect effect it's okay it<br>looks like i mean this was a hard work<br>of rodrigo<br>um and has a plenty of experience uh<br>working with influenza vitals and<br>memphis and said dude um<br>you know kiwi that went and did a postop<br>with dr<br>uh richard webby and dr robert webster<br>and so he came back home<br>and and he joined my lab like i i would<br>say like photos<br>five months before everything started so<br>it was perfect perfect timing for me and<br>for him and everyone everyone<br>so at that point we saw cp okay seems<br>based on the sequencing and the pcr<br>should be stars coronavide<br>let's go and check that so we got seven<br>viruses<br>supposedly isolates and we sequence them<br>and of course just like like like before<br>all of them were star score dividers too<br>but more importantly uh one thing that<br>we needed to compare and to verify<br>was the dividers that we were getting<br>from in the pc3 would match the vitals<br>that we<br>got from the patient and we did that and<br>he said you know sequence and full<br>genome<br>is basically 100 concordance and all of<br>them so that was<br>really good uh we were in the right path<br>uh<br>so i've been talking you know for a<br>while now uh 12 minutes<br>30 minutes uh but i haven't introduced<br>the virus and<br>at this point everybody i'm sure that<br>you're sick and tired of<br>listening to about astronomy vitals too<br>but i just want to introduce you here<br>briefly<br>it is a general single uh<br>positive rna virus the genome is roughly<br>30 thousand you know nucleotides have a<br>bunch of different<br>structural proteins but the most<br>important i mean at least for me and<br>a lot of people will agree is this five<br>glycoprotein which is the one that you<br>know<br>allows the virus to bind to the receptor<br>of the h2<br>and enter the cell and he's the main<br>target for neutralizing antibiotics<br>talking about vaccine development that<br>james is going to<br>tell you a little bit in a second so why<br>why i'm<br>saying all these is because just like<br>with other any other vitals and<br>these reminds me of hiv in the early<br>80s and 90s when we started sequencing<br>all these viruses and we started seeing<br>differences slightly difference in the<br>phallogenetic trees that<br>could be resembled kind of clades<br>clusters and that could or not<br>provide different you know phenotypic<br>differences and people have been talking<br>about increased vital lens or<br>transvisibility<br>or the viruses mutating is making more<br>pathogenic<br>so there is a lot of groups out there<br>collecting all this information<br>and collecting putting together these<br>nice figures so that's that's<br>that's really nice so what we did our<br>seven isolates<br>uh we did again we just compared it with<br>everything else that is out there<br>and we found now that out of the seven<br>we have basically four of these<br>different clits or clusters<br>that people have been defined in two two<br>two one of them<br>and what is called gh gv and health so<br>it's basically telling you that the<br>multiple introductions of these<br>different viruses into new zealand<br>um and i'm not gonna tell you more too<br>much about these because<br>this is not the focus on my lab right<br>now sequencing all these this is an<br>amazing job that<br>uh gemma gave him from our our our la<br>our department actually here together<br>with the esr here in new zealand they're<br>sequencing all 1500 isolates that we<br>have here in new zealand so they're<br>doing an amazing job and i'm sure they<br>would see more of these data<br>soon so why i'm showing you all these<br>is because people and these are the<br>different mutations that we have seen<br>that we saw in the different you know<br>isolates that we call this different<br>seven<br>in the full genome so there is not that<br>much compared with any other rna vitals<br>that we see out there you know influenza<br>for example or hiv or hepatitis c<br>that the virus is not rotating that much<br>it's not changing that much<br>it transmits like crazy but it's not<br>changing that much but there is a lot of<br>people that have been talking about<br>these particular mutations the d64<br>614g in the spike and some people say<br>that<br>increase the replication capacity in<br>cell culture or maybe increase in<br>transmissibility that is<br>replacing the wild type they want<br>without the rotation<br>and it can be real i mean there are a<br>couple of papers that are showing that<br>um and there are a few papers showing<br>using zebra type vitals is that<br>it seems that it is infecting better in<br>vitro<br>so we took our seven isolates and three<br>of them didn't have that mutation<br>and four of them they do have it and you<br>see real cell lines<br>which is a cell line this is not primary<br>cell we didn't see any difference at all<br>we're repeating these using primary<br>cells and of course with the cavities<br>only seven of them but but i'm not sure<br>if these vagus transmitted effects so<br>well that i don't know if a single<br>mutation would be responsible for this<br>increase in transvisibility this could<br>be a fundamental effect<br>and and i'm sure that a lot of you will<br>have questions so we can talk more about<br>that<br>at the end with the help of dr mingle<br>bostina<br>here in our department uh of course the<br>next step<br>we took that virus we need to see it<br>under the microscope and<br>he did an amazing job uh doing electro<br>microscopy and of course we see the<br>vitals you know<br>particles over there uh so what's next<br>what what do we do now uh we have the<br>bios you know that<br>we're publishing a really nice paper<br>about the characterization of these<br>vitals in new zealand<br>the one that are circulating here but<br>what do we do with that now<br>so if you remember at the beginning we<br>had a problem because we didn't have<br>positive controls<br>to test you know anything all the<br>different diagnostic kits and assets and<br>so on<br>so because we were able to order those<br>plasma synthetic genes we were able to<br>do it<br>so one of the first thing that we did<br>with once we isolated divide us was<br>purify rna and start sharing that rna<br>with clinical labs and<br>other academic institutions and<br>companies so they will have that<br>positive control to test<br>everything and we continue to do that in<br>fact we could<br>share an rna and we've been sharing<br>vitals uh inactivated virus<br>at this point we have been involved in<br>you know<br>and several uh projects related to copy<br>19 diagnosis<br>dr joe stanton i mentioned before she's<br>doing an amazing job<br>developing a point of care test uh we're<br>involved with another company<br>another institution developing uh<br>potentially micrornas<br>based diagnostics we have a<br>really this is a really exciting project<br>uh supported by the mbe<br>um about this infection and reuse of<br>personal protective equipment<br>uh together with dr ivan anderson from<br>the university of auckland<br>and we are participating in different<br>clinical studies you know<br>uh using composition plasma or even uh<br>the effect of<br>of coveting the brain on top of that as<br>you can imagine<br>and just checked yesterday actually<br>there are 322<br>two different drugs or compounds are<br>being tested<br>one-third of two-thirds of that is in<br>human trials right now<br>but you can imagine everybody wants to<br>test something about these vitals we're<br>testing anything<br>from monaco oil and honey<br>uh you name it you know small molecules<br>so everybody wants to test<br>something and the fact that we have<br>dividers that we were the first ones<br>were isolated in new zealand we have<br>the capability in the pc3 and we have<br>plenty of different projects doing this<br>at this point and and of course again<br>having the access to the virus and the<br>ability to grow in<br>the pc3 we have been collaborating and<br>then james will tell you more about<br>these vaccine development plan<br>plans here in new zealand<br>so on that note uh one minute ago i just<br>wanted to acknowledge everyone in my<br>life especially<br>of course my mother joe<br>robert i mean everybody that i mentioned<br>before uh they institute<br>the ibsc and megan coleman for all you<br>know helping out with the pc3<br>and of course the funding support you<br>bought the university of<br>great great shout out to the western<br>family chairman of the guinness that<br>just<br>basically helped me to do these from<br>from the very beginning<br>so on that note i'm gonna uh pass it to<br>james and we can talk more about<br>questions later<br>thank you miguel thank you very much um<br>i just wanted to quickly<br>introduce james um<br>he's uh the an associate professor in<br>the department of microbiology and<br>immunology<br>whose research interests include applied<br>in molecular immunology medical<br>microbiology and vaccines<br>he's a medical graduate from otago has a<br>phd from the university of<br>training at the university of oxford in<br>the uk returned to otago in 2013 to a<br>joint<br>clinical appointment working as a<br>clinical microbiologist<br>today he's going to speak to us about<br>the various approaches being used to<br>develop<br>covert 19 vaccines around the world<br>screen<br>oh let's wait for the uh<br>spinning circle of death<br>there we go so hopefully everyone can<br>see that okay<br>so yeah so thanks for the introduction<br>so i'm going to<br>talk to you today about uh give you an<br>update on where things are at<br>uh with vaccines for sars cove 2 the<br>cause of<br>covert 19. so as phil mentioned i've got<br>a joint academic and clinical<br>appointment<br>so i'm associate professor in the<br>department of microbiology and<br>immunology<br>at the university of otago i'm also a<br>clinical microbiologist at southern<br>community laboratories<br>um and based here in in dunedin<br>and uh also the director of the webster<br>center and<br>um from infectious diseases and i'm very<br>uh pleased to<br>see uh that uh professor webster and uh<br>robert and marjorie are here to listen<br>today i'm<br>very honored by that thank you so i<br>won't go into this<br>too much as miguel has already covered<br>it but obviously a popular first slide<br>for talks<br>just move that off because that's<br>probably on your screen<br>the exponential growth and some of the<br>countries that have been um<br>hard hit including america and<br>parts of parts of europe<br>um oops so this<br>really highlights the um the need for a<br>vaccine there was some talk<br>uh early on about uh achieving herd<br>immunity<br>through um slow uh slowing infection in<br>the community and allowing an infection<br>to<br>to spread and controlling admissions to<br>hospital<br>while rather than<br>waiting for a vaccine but just to<br>highlight<br>that that's not looking like a very good<br>option<br>based on data to date so spain has<br>there's been a recently published just<br>come on the last<br>week or so sierra prevalence survey um<br>this hit the news a little bit earlier<br>but they looked at the end of april and<br>the start of may sarah prevalence across<br>spain<br>took a very rigorous epidemiological<br>approach looked at over 60 000<br>participants<br>and found only um five percent of the<br>population<br>uh we had evidence of antibodies<br>to sars kov 2. this was despite over<br>200 000 um confirmed cases and uh 80<br>over 18 000<br>deaths and those confirmed cases are<br>probably an under undoubtedly an<br>underestimate<br>similarly uh sweden which has been<br>taking<br>been following a herd immunity approach<br>while this hasn't been published yet<br>there is data out there to suggest<br>that at the end of april where that had<br>over twenty thousand confirmed cases and<br>almost<br>uh three thousand deaths that only seven<br>point three percent of stockholm<br>um had antibodies uh two uh to<br>against saskov ii and now things have<br>progressed in sweden they've got almost<br>80 000 cases and over five and a half<br>so despite a lot of pain and a lot of<br>morbidity and mortality still low rates<br>of zero positivity in<br>in the community and if we look at the<br>death rates in<br>some countries um we can see that the uh<br>almost uh approaching one and two over<br>one in two thousand people have died in<br>some countries in europe uk and spain<br>usa is approaching that uh sweden is<br>also<br>um in that realm and in new york there's<br>a staggering<br>uh death rate with over 1 in 258 people<br>in new york has<br>died of cover 19.<br>whereas interestingly the countries near<br>sweden<br>that have taken a very different<br>approach where they've tried to control<br>infection through lockdowns um have seen<br>much lower<br>so a key question both from a question<br>of<br>herd immunity where the herd immunity<br>might work if<br>either natural infection or through<br>vaccination is whether<br>immune response can protect against<br>reinfection so there was an informative<br>recent publication<br>uh they came out in science uh where<br>they looked in<br>rhesus macaques and non-human primates<br>that have been infected<br>with they infected with sars cov2<br>in the laboratory and when they infected<br>them<br>with they then re-challenged them uh<br>with sarskov2<br>after 35 35 days after infection<br>and at the point of point<br>they could see a rise in neutralizing<br>antibodies they could see<br>um t cell immunity as well so<br>cd4 t cells and cd8 killer t cells that<br>are able to kill virally infected cells<br>could all be detected after um<br>after the initial challenge um so prior<br>to<br>uh re-infection and then they<br>re-challenged them day 35<br>after uh primary infection um and<br>those uh monkeys that had been um and<br>had<br>been had had their primary challenge<br>while they were still infected uh with<br>those with the primary challenge we saw<br>for high viral loads while some of the<br>monkeys were still infected<br>most of them we saw no virus was seen<br>in the nasopharynx upon re-challenge<br>and that's quantitative here so a few<br>monkeys were infected but most were<br>protected against reinfection day 35<br>post-primary infection and there was an<br>increase in<br>antibody responses including<br>neutralizing antibody responses<br>and in t cell responses<br>against the virus so this suggests that<br>at least at this early stage<br>35 days after primary infection that<br>the non-human primates that were<br>protected against<br>a subsequent infection although some of<br>them did shed some virus<br>at this early stage and there's no<br>convincing cases reported in the<br>literature yet of<br>people being reinfected uh with sars<br>sars kov2 either however this does<br>remain a concern so if we look at the<br>human endemic coronaviruses of which<br>there are four<br>so there's some early trials this one<br>from<br>published in 1990 where they looked at a<br>challenge<br>model so they took some healthy<br>volunteers these viruses normally cause<br>a<br>common cold and they took 15 volunteers<br>and they inoculated them with<br>the uh with this hkov 229e<br>and they were able to infect 10 of them<br>eight of them became symptomatic<br>and they could measure an immune<br>response to them they then re-challenged<br>them a year later with<br>exactly the same virus of of those who<br>hadn't become infected the first time<br>all of them became infected the second<br>time so they<br>their protection against the initial<br>challenge hadn't lasted and one became<br>symptomatic<br>and of those who had become infected the<br>first time<br>six of them became reinfected although<br>none of them developed<br>significant symptoms so it does suggest<br>that there's concerns with the human<br>endemic<br>coronaviruses that immunity is<br>short-lasting<br>and that people can get reinfected<br>and there's a pre-print that has just<br>come out this is sort of a heroic<br>study where they followed people up 10<br>people<br>were followed over 30 years and they<br>collected<br>blood samples and measured antibody<br>levels against<br>the human coronaviruses on a regular<br>basis<br>and they defined reinfection by horizon<br>and antibody teters and they could show<br>that uh for all of these viruses that<br>there were frequent rises in antibody<br>teeters suggesting um reinfections<br>unfortunately there's no data on<br>symptomatology<br>but suggesting that on average uh or the<br>the median time between infections uh<br>here with a human endemic coronavis is<br>only<br>about 30 months so that immunity is<br>short short<br>moved to these chronoviruses at least<br>so what do we know about sars cov2 so<br>there's emerging data<br>that shows that antibody levels<br>decline and this is being replicated and<br>now multiple studies so this is a paper<br>that was published in nature medicine<br>out of china<br>so looking at the levels of antibodies<br>there's a log logarithmic scale so they<br>looked at asymptomatic and symptomatic<br>patients<br>uh symptomatic patients had a higher<br>levels of<br>antibody on the whole but both<br>asymptomatic and<br>symptomatic patients there was a decline<br>in antibody levels between<br>a month after exposure and then um eight<br>weeks<br>after discharge from hospital and<br>similarly another study that's just hit<br>the media in the last<br>week out of the uk where they serially<br>followed<br>people and they showed that whether<br>those who had very severe symptoms so<br>these are then read of the people who<br>ended up on invasive ventilation or on<br>on bypass um or had severe respiratory<br>failure<br>and black are people who had less severe<br>disease<br>and all pain while there were higher<br>antibody levels than those who had<br>severe disease<br>and all there was a decline in antibody<br>levels with time<br>so this is not unexpected this has been<br>seen<br>after uh after other beta coronavirus<br>infections so the original uh sars virus<br>which removed and<br>emerged in 2002 2003 and caused a<br>limited<br>there was also a decline in antibody<br>levels seen so this is looking uh<br>out 36 months after onset of<br>disease and whether you're looking at<br>total antibody levels or looking at<br>neutralizing antibody levels<br>there's a drop in antibody levels and<br>there's a drop in the percentage of<br>people<br>who are positive for for antibodies so<br>it's been seen with similar viruses<br>before<br>interestingly uh t-cell responses uh<br>seem to be<br>uh more persistent so this is a paper<br>that has just come out<br>and um and from from a paper that's just<br>come out in nature<br>um and part of that paper they looked at<br>antibody responses again sorry t cell<br>responses against<br>the original sars virus and they could<br>still detect them 17 years<br>post infection so they did this by a<br>ali spot method so stimulating the cells<br>with overlapping<br>peptides so these are different patients<br>along the x-axis<br>and then looking at the number of<br>spot-forming units<br>producing interferon gamma-producing<br>t-cells basically<br>against different different parts of the<br>virus so they looked at the<br>nuclear protein and saw abundant<br>t cell responses against nuclear protein<br>across these patients<br>but not so much against non-structural<br>proteins so can still detect uh<br>still detect t cell responses sometime<br>after infection<br>and we can certainly detect strong t<br>cell responses and and covered 19<br>patients<br>so this is a paper out of la jolla from<br>alexandria city's group and they<br>looked at overlapping peptides spanning<br>the genome of the<br>proteome of sarskoff ii so this is the<br>genome structure<br>and here are the structural proteins the<br>matrix nuclear protein and the<br>spike we see strong responses there<br>again by this is by different looking<br>different different method of readout<br>but essentially<br>still able to detect strong responses<br>and we also can see some lesser<br>responses to the non-structural<br>proteins so dominated by the responses<br>to the structural proteins<br>interestingly they could also see<br>cross-reactive t cells<br>excuse me in unexposed donors and this<br>has now been replicated by<br>several different groups around the<br>world um and<br>but the specificity of these t cells<br>does seem to differ<br>and that they seem to be more against<br>the non-uh<br>to the non-structural uh protein some to<br>the to the spike protein<br>but um whether these reflect um expo<br>probably reflecting exposure to other<br>endemic<br>human coronaviruses as well and what the<br>implications for these cross-reactive<br>pre-existing<br>t-cells are for disease course<br>and protection or for exacerbation<br>diseases is unknown at this<br>stage so what do we know about vaccines<br>for coronaviruses<br>so there have been um a number of<br>vaccines were<br>worked on for the original sars vaccine<br>and a couple<br>got through to phase one trials and were<br>shown to be immunogenic but<br>unfortunately<br>well fortunately the virus went away<br>through public health efforts<br>and it became difficult to pursue these<br>vaccine development<br>programs and and funding dried up we've<br>also seen the emergence of<br>mers virus in the<br>2010s and that continues in the middle<br>east and there's been three recent<br>vaccines that have come through to the<br>uh to phase one clinical trials<br>uh for uh for mers and these were all<br>published uh this<br>this year uh so we've got limited uh<br>data to date on cronovirus<br>vaccines some of the pre-clinical data<br>does give<br>a reason for some pause and<br>reflection so there is some reports from<br>the original<br>sars vaccine work and with some vaccines<br>and some animal models<br>suggesting that there might be some<br>vaccine-mediated enhanced<br>disease so this is one example of that<br>from<br>using a double and activated<br>whole viral vaccine and they looked at<br>and aged mice so old mice are about a<br>year old and they and then they<br>vaccinated them with<br>this vaccine this double inactivated<br>vaccine with or without alum<br>and they could show partial protection<br>this is looking at weight loss<br>um in the vaccinated mice and they<br>showed partial<br>protection against viral replication<br>whereas in young mice they were fully<br>protected and when they looked in these<br>older mice<br>they could see um evidence of<br>infiltration of eosinophils<br>into the lungs and this was higher if<br>they had received<br>alum as an adjuvant with that vaccine<br>and they they looked at the cytokines<br>that were being produced<br>in the um being produced in the lung and<br>they could see<br>these sort of th2 cytokines that might<br>be driving the csinophilic response so<br>some concern that um especially in older<br>mice and an older mice and<br>concerned that this might be replicated<br>in humans that there might be um<br>there's potential for the vaccine to a<br>vaccine to worsen disease<br>there's also another method uh or<br>mechanism that has been postulated for<br>enhancement of vaccine mediated<br>enhancement of disease and that's<br>from antibodies against the spike<br>protein and this comes from non-human<br>primate studies<br>so this paper that was published last<br>year they had a vaccine a<br>vaccinia virus vaccine that produ<br>produced the sars spike protein or they<br>had a control vaccine<br>and they could show they got good<br>neutralizing antibodies and those<br>neutralizing antibodies<br>protected when they re-challenged<br>protected against<br>infection um in in the nasopharynx<br>but they got worse um histology score<br>histopathology scores<br>in the lungs and they could then show<br>that if they use as they transferred<br>pre-immune sera into the into<br>naive uh rhesus macaques and then<br>challenged them<br>they could show the same thing that they<br>could replicate this<br>worsening of histopathology suggesting<br>that the antibody might be worsening<br>um caught the cause of this disease<br>and the mechanism for that seemed to be<br>by causing<br>increased production of pro-inflammatory<br>cytokines<br>from various macrophage populations in<br>the lungs so with those that got the<br>control<br>um igg so that there was no pre-existing<br>immunity<br>they mainly had uh anti-inflammatory<br>cytokine production with tgf beta<br>from from various macrophage populations<br>whereas in those that had had the<br>the pre-immune syria with anti-spike<br>there was a lot of il-6 pro-inflammatory<br>cytokine production<br>so concerningly there does seem to be<br>well<br>there's been the observation that there<br>is higher levels of neutralizing<br>antibodies<br>in seen in severe disease versus those<br>that have got<br>less severe disease however if you look<br>at those that have got hyper<br>inflammation<br>uh some high levels of the likes of il-6<br>it doesn't seem to be uh this is inside<br>of two<br>it doesn't seem to be any higher levels<br>so so maybe<br>what's been seen with sars and non-human<br>primates may not hold up<br>in um in size of turn humans but we just<br>uh we need to have some caution about<br>that in vaccines<br>so moving along to considering what's<br>happening with vaccines so<br>there's been a uh the the traditional<br>path for vaccines takes many years and<br>uh we might spend five to ten years in<br>pre-clinical development<br>and then another ten years going through<br>various clinical testing to<br>uh before we can deploy a vaccine and<br>license it<br>and obviously a 15-year time frame at<br>the moment has<br>is really not going to be acceptable uh<br>given the current global situation<br>so given experience that's from ebola<br>vaccine development<br>this timeline has been compressed with a<br>lot of this pre-clinical testing<br>occurring simultaneously along with<br>phase one<br>testing so this is safety uh testing and<br>small populations and some<br>immunogenicity testing<br>and then looking at trying to conduct<br>these larger studies<br>uh simultaneously and also<br>starting the manufacturing process<br>during the clinical testing<br>process as well so there are a lot of<br>vaccines<br>currently in development um so over<br>over 160 and some of these are already<br>in<br>clinical phase trials and<br>one has been approved for use by the<br>chinese<br>army or in the chinese army so these are<br>a mix of<br>traditional and novel methods so we've<br>got traditional methods such an<br>inactivated<br>which have been for example influenza<br>vaccines are<br>an example of that or hepatitis a<br>attenuated viral uh vaccines are<br>probably further down the track but<br>they're out<br>and that they're further away but<br>they're examples of those that are<br>currently in development<br>they're currently in use and like the<br>measles mumps and rubella<br>and then the protein subunit vaccines<br>and virus-like particles<br>which we commonly use at the moment such<br>as the hepatitis b and<br>hpv vaccines um also in development<br>a lot of the early leaders of these<br>novel vaccines such as the viral victim<br>vaccines<br>and the only one of these that's<br>currently reached the clinic is<br>an ebola vaccine that was recently<br>approved and then rna vaccines and dna<br>vaccines that are<br>also where we're delivering a gene so<br>all of these are genetic vaccines that<br>are delivering a gene<br>from sars cov2<br>to try and get their gene express and an<br>immune response against that<br>but none of these rna or dna vaccines<br>have yet to<br>reach a licensed product so uh<br>from an inactivated viral perspective<br>that one of the leading candidates<br>couple of leading candidates from china<br>and synovac leading the charge here so<br>they've published there's pre-clinical<br>data<br>in science recently and they showed that<br>it induced good neutralizing antibody<br>responses<br>that were at a higher level than those<br>seen in<br>recovered patients and if<br>with higher doses they could effectively<br>suppress<br>or largely suppress viral rna<br>in the in the throat and could<br>thoroughly and could completely suppress<br>it<br>um in the lungs and importantly even<br>though they gave it with alum<br>uh no immunopathology was seen and<br>they're progressing to phase one<br>they've completed apparently they're<br>phase one two trials although they<br>haven't been published yet<br>um apparently they had good um uh<br>responses and they're currently planning<br>a phase three trial um in brazil<br>the um other one the leading probably<br>the leading candidate at the moment is<br>the university of oxford and<br>astrazeneca's<br>viral vector so this is a chimpanzee<br>adenoviral vector that<br>is expressing the sars cov2 spike<br>protein that carries their gene for that<br>and in the monkeys they showed that it<br>was able to<br>um prevent pneumonia in those monkeys so<br>they it suppressed uh viral replication<br>um and uh and the lungs and the bal<br>of fluid of those monkeys and protected<br>them<br>against disease so here the mock monkey<br>immunized monkeys when they were<br>challenged they developed<br>pneumonia whereas that wasn't seen in<br>the<br>in the vaccinated monkeys but<br>unfortunately um<br>they didn't manage to suppress uh<br>replication in the in the nose so<br>this vaccine um suggested that at least<br>with a single dose might be able to<br>prevent uh prevent disease but maybe not<br>uh prevent transmission<br>although they did have a subsequent<br>paper where they showed at least in<br>mice that you could boost with a<br>homologous with a<br>second dose at day 28 and you've got<br>higher levels of<br>antibodies so it might be that a second<br>dose might be able to further base those<br>levels<br>and hot off the press many of you have<br>seen that<br>just published in the lancet today the<br>phase one two trial results have come<br>out for this vaccine<br>so looked at over a thousand healthy<br>volunteers who got a single dose apart<br>from 10 volunteers who got a second dose<br>at day 28<br>and compared to meningococcal conjugate<br>vaccine<br>and they showed that they got<br>neutralizing antibodies<br>and all of those uh or almost all of the<br>patients so the volunteers who received<br>a single dose<br>um and that those levels were lower than<br>convalescent um plasma samples<br>but in the ten who got a a booster dose<br>they got<br>um comparable levels uh to convalesce<br>asthma samples<br>and they also showed good t cell<br>responses as well<br>um they're progressing they've already<br>progressed to phase two three trials in<br>the uk and phase three trials are also<br>underway in brazil<br>in south africa so this is progressing<br>at a rate um<br>the other leading candidate i want to<br>talk about which there's been a lot of<br>talk about is moduna<br>so moderna has got a rna vaccine so this<br>is<br>mrna one two seven three it's a lipid<br>nanoparticle<br>and it basically encodes a pre-fusion<br>stabilized spike protein and their<br>pre-clinical data they showed<br>good neutralizing antibody induction<br>varied by the<br>mouse strain that you gave it to<br>and that it was able to protect against<br>disease<br>in a dose-dependent manner so lower<br>doses were<br>sub um partially protective or as high<br>doses completely protected against<br>challenge<br>and importantly they saw no enhanced<br>lung disease with those<br>subprotective doses and they've also<br>just published<br>phase one trial data that was in the new<br>england journal last week<br>and they showed that with two<br>vaccinations 28 days apart that they got<br>excellent levels of neutralizing<br>antibodies<br>that were sort of similar to<br>convalescent<br>serum unfortunately their highest dose<br>to 250 micrograms was too<br>too reactogenic so that won't be in<br>subsequent trials<br>um and their phase two trials are<br>already underway um and they've got a<br>phase three trial plan for july<br>so that's one of the major challenges is<br>that part of the way there is developing<br>a safer<br>and effective vaccine we'll get to see<br>whether they'll be effective but<br>data today is promising we then have to<br>manufacture it<br>and we have to scale up and this is<br>perhaps uh<br>as equally a large challenge as<br>developing a vaccine<br>so currently the in the global market<br>there's uh<br>if we exclude seasonal influenza<br>vaccines as three and a half billion<br>doses of vaccines<br>made globally per year that's the the<br>current global capacity<br>and if we conclude seasonal influenza<br>capacity that's another one and a half<br>billion doses<br>in this pandemic surge capacity of 6.4<br>billion doses unfortunately the<br>influenza vaccine uses quite a different<br>um<br>manufacturing process to many of these<br>other vaccines<br>and we're seeing that there's already<br>upscaling of manufacturing capacity<br>of many of these leading candidates but<br>we don't know which of these are going<br>to be successful and when they're going<br>to come online but<br>delivering these is going to be a major<br>issue there is a global push to try and<br>ensure equitable access to uh sales<br>cough two vaccines as this<br>didn't occur very well with the previous<br>uh swine flu pandemic<br>h1n1 back in 2009 2010<br>however there are concerns about whether<br>this will<br>how effective this will be we've already<br>seen efforts from<br>to try and purchase leading vaccine<br>producers to<br>try and secure supply<br>for particular countries um and has<br>reviewed an excellent new york times<br>article recently suggesting that<br>uh the serum institute of india which is<br>one of the world's largest producers of<br>vaccine doses said that<br>they would see most of the vaccine would<br>have to go to their countrymen before it<br>goes abroad<br>and just probably the reality is it's<br>going to be very hard for a government<br>to allow vaccine<br>produced in their country to be exported<br>while there's a major problem<br>at home and we've seen in other spheres<br>as well<br>um that that<br>equitable just they're going to be<br>challenges to equitable distribution<br>uh globally and finally just<br>manufacturing is only part of the<br>problem we then need to be able to<br>deliver it as well we need to decide<br>who's going to get it first<br>how that vaccine is going to be stored<br>who's going to administer it and this is<br>going to be a problem on an<br>unprecedented level<br>when we're trying to deliver vaccine to<br>our entire population which is just far<br>current processes and there could be<br>some additional challenges as well as<br>particular<br>candidates for example currently the<br>modern mrna vaccine needs to be stored<br>at very low level uh temperatures and<br>has to be used<br>very quickly um after thawing which is<br>also going to provide extra<br>challenges to delivery so i'll stop<br>there and<br>thanks very much james so we're now<br>opening uh<br>this uh excellent uh panel discussion<br>up for q a and we've had a few<br>questions come through the chat so i'm<br>just going to<br>first one's actually uh for miguel and<br>it was<br>um could you talk a bit more about the<br>effects of covert on the brain<br>that you mentioned briefly on slide 22.<br>this is a really good question and like<br>somebody said when a scientist says a<br>good question is<br>is the same thing that's saying i don't<br>know<br>um it is this isn't developing and we we<br>know that<br>the virus can infect the neurons um but<br>at least in my lab and what i've seen<br>published by other people and what we<br>have done here<br>we don't see any cytopathic effect we<br>don't see any change the virus is able<br>to enter the cell but it's not doing<br>anything<br>uh the cells can survive up to four<br>weeks<br>that's what we have seen um people have<br>been complaining patients that recover<br>that have been complaining with some<br>symptoms<br>hallucinations you know fogginess a lot<br>of different symptoms<br>and so this is an open field right now<br>with more and more patients<br>recovering we're going to be able to you<br>know find what's going on with the<br>great so um the<br>next questions are sort of related to<br>the immune system so i<br>james you might want to answer some of<br>these but can you talk a bit more about<br>the<br>relative contribution of the spike<br>protein antibodies<br>versus the spike specific t cell<br>responses and<br>is there any sort of evidence<br>that immunity to one or both or<br>you know is more critical for clinical<br>outcome in the acute<br>uh so yep so if we're thinking about<br>patients who are infected um<br>uh with uh two<br>uh there is uh probably both are<br>important we<br>need um neutralizing antibodies against<br>uh the spike protein to protect<br>or to prevent infection of new cells and<br>we need<br>t-cell responses against probably a<br>broader range of<br>to to clear those cells that already<br>infected through cytotoxic t cell<br>response or through<br>t cell help um i think it's uh<br>unclear at the moment how t cells might<br>contrib what the role of t cell and<br>antibody responses<br>might be in contributing to<br>more severe disease um that i think<br>there's clearly<br>more stronger antibody responses in<br>patients and the quality of the t-cell<br>responses differs in patients who've got<br>more severe disease<br>but whether that's a result of more<br>severe infection or whether contributing<br>to the pathogenesis is unclear<br>data from that paper that's pre-print<br>from<br>the uh imperial um<br>suggests that uh that i showed suggested<br>that uh at least while there are higher<br>levels of<br>neutralizing antibodies and people with<br>the most severe disease it doesn't seem<br>to be<br>driving the associated with the<br>hyperinflation and that might be more of<br>a<br>um innate immune uh response and sort of<br>in older people we see more of a<br>pro-inflammatory um bent<br>uh sort of an inflammation<br>response as well so i'm not sure that<br>quite covers the question<br>yeah i mean i think you know the problem<br>is we just don't have enough information<br>and so actually that tease up to the<br>next question because<br>i think people are looking for the<br>practical implications of<br>watching a waning humor or response<br>encouraging data that there might be<br>long term t cell immunity to size kobe 1<br>and those patients that were infected<br>way back<br>um so what's the implications for that<br>with a vaccine you know is this<br>something<br>that the vaccines are predominantly<br>targeting the humor or immune response<br>is it going to have to be something that<br>you<br>have every year like the flu vaccine<br>does it really matter<br>is reinfection a more benign disease<br>um do you have any thoughts about that<br>yeah<br>so i think it's uh unknown at this stage<br>what the<br>durability of the antibody response will<br>be with the different<br>vaccines it may well be that<br>boosters are required<br>at the moment it's um<br>i think for looking at all the data<br>that's out there<br>i'm not convinced that we're going to<br>see<br>sterilizing immunity from<br>any of the vaccine candidates i think i<br>mean all the<br>the rna and the viral vector vaccines<br>all seem to<br>give us similar roughly similar response<br>they're all sort of<br>taking a roughly similar approach<br>it may be that we need more antigens<br>greater breath of antigen<br>may such as with the inactivated viral<br>vaccine may<br>provide better um longer term protection<br>i don't think we know at this<br>stage but so i think<br>these these first these first generation<br>of vaccines i think<br>will likely provide personal protection<br>but i'm not convinced they're going to<br>provide<br>that will protect those who<br>haven't who refuse vaccines which is<br>another issue which i didn't<br>touch on but which i think is a massive<br>uh massive issue is vaccine hesitancy<br>and how we actually get significant<br>portion of the population<br>to uh to accept vaccination<br>so it's a very good point in new zealand<br>i have to say<br>um so since you two are some of the<br>leading experts on<br>size kobe 2 in new zealand you may be<br>asked this question by<br>your government so if a vaccine does<br>become available in the us<br>before new zealand would you be<br>comfortable<br>advising your government to let us<br>vaccinated u.s people into<br>um i i can tackle that with a two-second<br>answer<br>and i wouldn't discontinue what we're<br>doing right now<br>everybody coming to the border it should<br>be checked if you are<br>active or positive you have to go to<br>quarantine and<br>until proof that this vaccine is working<br>uh it's too soon we're doing so well<br>right now here<br>and the rest of the world is not doing<br>that well that we cannot risk it<br>we live in our bubble and we're doing<br>great i wouldn't recommend that<br>to be honest<br>exactly<br>miguel i think until the vaccines<br>deployed in new zealand i'd be reluctant<br>i personally would be reluctant to relax<br>for the restrictions<br>so miguel maybe um you can talk a bit<br>about the implications<br>of the mutations of the virus which i<br>believe<br>are mainly within spike and are you<br>concerned about that given<br>that the vaccines are predominantly<br>targeting spike<br>does this worry you no no at all<br>actually and we can talk about these for<br>a long long time<br>uh i've made my career of working with<br>vitals evolution<br>these virus is not mutating at all<br>okay this is basically it it has no<br>reason to mutate<br>it's transmitting like crazy the way it<br>is why it's going to take<br>the what we're seeing right now on those<br>phylogenetic trees that i show<br>the minimum mutations we're talking<br>about five six mutations<br>randomly in the genome you know thirty<br>thousand nucleotides you know<br>that's nothing if you compare it with<br>any other rna vitals<br>without their proof reading ability that<br>these fighters have that's nothing<br>so the virus is not mutated it's not<br>going to become more pathogenic it's not<br>becoming more vigilant<br>and what we're seeing with this<br>particular mutation in the spike<br>is it's just you know genetic drift this<br>is the founder effect<br>now once we start deploying our vaccine<br>and we start deploying drugs<br>that would be a challenge we will need<br>to see the vitals as an answer for that<br>and and before we do that believe me<br>that's what we do in the labs<br>when once before everyone deserves i'm<br>sure that people have been trying to<br>select from<br>then of rendezvous receipt and mitosis<br>in vitro and the same thing will happen<br>with the vaccine<br>so we'll not we'll need to cross that<br>bridge when when we get there<br>but divide us these vitals doesn't<br>mutate like any other viruses<br>so there's another question uh another<br>practical<br>orientated questions um a um a lot of<br>emphasis has been placed on the use of<br>masks in the us as you know<br>it's become a politicized issue over<br>here uh so the question is would you re<br>recommend<br>masks in new zealand if god forbid the<br>virus did<br>into the community again<br>yes i mean i think there's emerging well<br>i think there's<br>now ample evidence um<br>that masks and social distancing<br>are effective at controlling the<br>community spread of<br>um of sarskoff too so i think i mean<br>we've seen it now melbourne<br>victoria is now making masks compulsory<br>the compulsory in the uk<br>in certain situations so um there's<br>already<br>been been discussion in the community<br>um or been discussion uh previously<br>about whether there should be masks<br>be used in new zealand so i'm sure that<br>that will happen if there was community<br>transmission<br>so next question is related to therapy<br>that not so much was touched on about<br>that<br>in your talks but can one of you<br>elaborate on the potential application<br>and um and pathogenesis of uh using the<br>uh yep there's limited data that i've<br>seen<br>to date but so far it appears to be safe<br>um there's an issue with determining<br>that there's adequate amounts of<br>i mean as we saw with um i showed with<br>the<br>dropping neutralizing antibodies with<br>time it's got to make<br>screen those donations and to make sure<br>there's<br>high levels of neutralizing antibodies<br>and miguel's been involved<br>in that but there doesn't seem to be any<br>reports of enhancement<br>of disease yet that i've seen in the<br>lecture<br>so i i'm gonna jump there because i<br>actually have a question for<br>for the immunologist for james now<br>because i i had this discussion<br>yesterday<br>with a colleague so on these case<br>let's say that i'm treating without a<br>convolution plasma<br>and and you know that controls the vital<br>replication<br>does that mean that my immune system is<br>not going to mount<br>a response it's going to go lazy as you<br>know i already got antibody for somebody<br>else i'm not going to<br>make it in my own uh and how that's<br>going to affect the potential<br>infection yeah i mean you<br>clearly yeah you're still going to have<br>an immune response to clear the<br>infection<br>um yeah you will suppress the amount of<br>virus and this in the more severe<br>patients there is more<br>virus seen later in the course of<br>disease<br>and it's probably contributing to the<br>hyper inflammation that's seen in some<br>patients so as i say though<br>we get to see good clinical data showing<br>that<br>um that convalescent serum is<br>uh in a good trial showing that it's<br>effective<br>so the convolution crm is basically<br>buying time for your immune system to<br>you know pick up and<br>get to the next okay um yeah and<br>sorry i hijacked the conversation oh no<br>that's right so there is another<br>question is there a role for the<br>therapeutics so i'm guessing<br>beyond convalescent sarah uh the<br>the only approved agent is really remdi<br>severe but maybe the question also is<br>broadening<br>about the hydroxychloroquine issue<br>as well in reality the reality is<br>without touching too much of the hybrids<br>of chloroquine<br>uh the reality is that every single<br>pharmaceutical company in the world<br>institutional i mean you name it<br>everybody's trying to find something<br>that you know that is able to block the<br>replication of these viruses<br>um and believe it or not the only ones<br>that we've seen so far the friend this<br>year of this drug that was about fatigue<br>here does a good job as well<br>and this drug that was developed<br>actually here in new zealand um<br>that is blocking the name right now<br>james help me um<br>call us in the breed or something like<br>that uh that that he seems to be<br>blocking the two<br>and it goes back to the proof reading<br>ability of the vital providers this<br>particular antivirus<br>is able to go back and fix any any<br>mistakes made by the polymerase<br>something that doesn't happen with the<br>other rna viruses<br>so when you use a nucleus analog or like<br>neuron density or any of these<br>the vitals is going to be able to go<br>back and fix it so that's that's the<br>challenge here<br>um so but yeah that that to me other<br>than developing a vaccine<br>having an apotent divider that is going<br>to reduce the<br>the symptoms and then the patient's not<br>gonna die it's gonna be a really bad<br>call or go to the hospital and<br>uh that would be the key for me and this<br>beer so far is the only one that we have<br>yeah so we need the tamiflu equivalent<br>that's what i keep saying because we<br>don't have<br>ram deserver is not the tamiflu for<br>saskatchewan with the caveat that they<br>influence second you know<br>develop resistance against standard flow<br>right we don't want that for<br>this corona is also important as well i<br>mean i think the point has been made<br>that in the ring disavow trials a lot of<br>the<br>treatment was started i mean the median<br>time just starting treatment was quite<br>late in the course<br>and that maybe better outcomes might be<br>seen if it was<br>started early i mean we know that for<br>other viral infections such as influenza<br>you get a better<br>uh response if you start drugs earlier<br>but i agree<br>kath that especially if you're going to<br>do that you ideally want an oral<br>drug that you can administer to lots of<br>people i mean the other thing that's<br>been shown to be effective is<br>dexamethasone and those who<br>need supplemental oxygen or uh on<br>ventilation and that certainly seems to<br>lower mortality<br>by dampening the immune response<br>sorry guys really quick we learned i<br>mean from the 20 30 years ago<br>that a single therapy may not be the<br>answer we may have to do a double triple<br>triple therapy to treat these these<br>fires<br>so i have one last question before i<br>hand it back to phil<br>and it's i'm asking it because it's<br>actually relevant to new zealand and<br>because i've had<br>two bcgs vaccines myself plus i worked<br>on the tv<br>award at green lane hospital so um<br>what do you think of the hypothesis that<br>uh bcg vaccine might be protective<br>uh for getting severe size kobe 2<br>infection<br>yeah um so the<br>i mean that so there is data around that<br>suggests that um<br>bcg um is<br>uh able to to have some<br>um persisting effects on the innate<br>immune response<br>so so-called trained innate immunity uh<br>and how long that lasts is<br>um remains to be seen so i think the<br>early early on in the in the upper and<br>the pandemic<br>there was some epidemiological data that<br>suggested that rates of infection<br>and mortality were lower in countries<br>that had<br>had bcg vaccination versus those that<br>don't i'm not sure that that held up<br>i don't think that's held up as things<br>have spread um i think<br>i mean there's so many other confounding<br>factors on that such as access to<br>diagnostics um<br>when things were having a female prime<br>minister is apparently also<br>a prognostic positive five looks too<br>yeah<br>so um i i i'm very dubious i have to<br>admit that<br>bcg will have any protective effect<br>um especially in adult populations<br>events but there are clinical trials<br>underway<br>um and i think the other thing to say is<br>that<br>if want we need to be clear that it's<br>going to work before<br>we go down that track because um<br>otherwise we're going to use up<br>global stocks of bcg um and they're not<br>going to be available for use where they<br>should be used with such as in<br>sub-saharan africa preventing<br>uh severe neonatal um uh<br>tb all right so phil i'm gonna hand<br>the q a back to you to close the session<br>thanks kath so james and miguel thank<br>you so much for<br>for a great presentation and a great<br>discussion and i know we<br>ended up running over a little bit but<br>uh i think it was um<br>very much worth it and thanks to<br>everyone who attended<br>uh today and everybody who uh was<br>involved in preparing for this event<br>um i'd ask people on the call if they<br>can to reach out to other us-based<br>alumni if they're not available if they<br>weren't on today's session let them know<br>that we're recording available<br>we're also going to let you know uh of<br>other sessions that we are<br>planning if anybody has any suggestions<br>for topics that that would they think<br>would be a particular interest<br>to the us alumni group please pass those<br>along as well<br>and hopefully uh in the not too distant<br>future when this<br>pandemic is at least under control and<br>behind us we can begin to<br>to meet again in person various events<br>around the country as<br>has been the case of the past so thank<br>you everyone once again and uh i wish<br>you<br>wish everybody good health and happiness</p></main><footer
