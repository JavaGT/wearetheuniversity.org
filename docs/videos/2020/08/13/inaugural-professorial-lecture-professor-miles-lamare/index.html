His research has been undertaken on species from the Tropics to the Poles, and in both hemispheres. Recently, Miles has examined the outcomes of climate change on marine species, including the impacts of ozone loss in polar regions, ocean warming and acidification.<br><br>His present research includes examining responses to environmental change in coral reef species in Papua New Guinea and Australia, invasive sea urchins in New Zealand, adaptive potential in Antarctic sea stars to warming oceans, and the use of environmental DNA to track sea star outbreaks. Miles is presently principal investigator in a six-year New Zealand Antarctic Science Platform programme that will commence in 2020 to examine changes in the Ross Sea, and is an associate investigator on Marsden-funded, ground-breaking research into the molecular mechanisms of regeneration in sea squirts.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

the<br>university of otago<br>and it is my pleasure to welcome you to<br>this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor miles<br>lamar<br>on behalf of the university i would like<br>to begin by<br>extending a particularly warm welcome to<br>the members of miles family who have<br>joined us this evening<br>his wife kelly his parents bev and jake<br>lamarr<br>who have traveled down from timaru and<br>his in-laws<br>marge and russell blair to all of you no<br>my hat am i welcome<br>i would also like to acknowledge staff<br>and<br>students from across the university and<br>members of the wider dunedin public who<br>have come to join us this evening<br>and i'd also like to warmly acknowledge<br>our chancellor dr royden somerville who<br>is also here this evening<br>now these inaugural professorial<br>lectures are always<br>a time of immense celebration for the<br>university<br>and i am delighted to see so many people<br>here<br>to share and to help us celebrate in<br>this important milestone<br>in miles's career but tonight is special<br>for<br>other reasons as well this is the very<br>first ipl that we have had<br>since our level 4 lockdown and i think<br>it's important for all of us<br>to acknowledge how incredibly lucky we<br>are to be here tonight<br>surrounded by our friends and our<br>colleagues<br>public lectures like this are simply<br>impossible in most parts of the rest of<br>the world<br>so miles thank you very much for giving<br>us a really good reason to come together<br>and celebrate this auspicious occasion<br>we are delighted to be here to share<br>time with both you<br>and with your family now as you will<br>learn<br>from the lecture this evening professor<br>lamar is an effective and motivating<br>teacher<br>he is a popular postgraduate supervisor<br>and he is an<br>incredibly successful researcher he has<br>also provided exemplary service to his<br>discipline<br>his department and to the wider<br>university<br>so miles on behalf of the university of<br>otago i would like<br>to warmly congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion to professor<br>i am really looking forward to your<br>lecture this evening<br>i will now call on the pro vice<br>chancellor of the division of sciences<br>professor richard barker who is going to<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>miles academic journey to professor<br>katoa<br>vice chancellor tanakwe deputy vice<br>chancellors<br>it is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight<br>professor miles lemire to give his<br>inaugural professor electorate<br>university of otago<br>as indicated by our vice chancellor<br>miles is one of our new<br>professors at the university of otago<br>having received a well-deserved<br>promotion to the position in february<br>of this year born in whangarei<br>miles has whakapapa to ngati rahiri of<br>thames<br>and te araha the ngati<br>rahiri chief te mokhena ho had a<br>daughter emma who married an amish irish<br>immigrant george<br>lipsy their daughter freda ismail's<br>grandmother<br>and she married his grandfather rangi la<br>mer<br>the son of a frenchman who was sent to<br>new zealand on remittance<br>and this is how our current hod of<br>marine science came to have such an<br>appropriate surname<br>for someone in his position<br>continuing this interesting journey<br>miles spent his<br>childhood in kiribati on the isle the<br>atoll of tarawa<br>his father with us tonight was working<br>there for new zealand customs<br>and from his backyard explorations of<br>a coral reef playground grew a deep<br>interest in marine ecology this interest<br>in our natural world<br>led naturally to degrees from the<br>university with the world's best<br>natural laboratories the university of<br>otago<br>he subsequently graduated with a<br>bachelor of science with honours and<br>zoology and botany from our university<br>in 1990 and then went on to a phd<br>in 1997. after a postdoctoral fellowship<br>in friday harbour laboratories and<br>washington state<br>miles returned to otago in 2000 and took<br>up a lectureship<br>in marine science where he remains today<br>tonight we celebrate his rise through<br>the ranks to full professor<br>as the vice chancellor has alluded to<br>this promotion<br>is for high achievement in research he<br>has published<br>more than 100 research articles and for<br>the academics amongst us has an<br>h index of 31 with over 3 000<br>career citations his research has impact<br>his research is also award-winning<br>having received the<br>united states congress medal for<br>services in antarctica in 1995<br>and also the antarctic service medal of<br>the united states of america<br>awarded the following year in<br>recognition of his valuable<br>contributions to the us antarctic<br>program<br>his interests in the antarctic continue<br>to this day<br>and he leads the antarctic science<br>platform<br>a 10 million investment by the new<br>zealand government<br>in addition to his research miles is a<br>superb teacher<br>and has acted as a supervisor and mentor<br>for a large number of postgraduate<br>students<br>he has supervised the completion of 13<br>phd students has another five in<br>progress<br>and also 33 master students and included<br>that in that number is my nephew matt<br>who sends his regards<br>miles also has gifts as an administrator<br>gifts that<br>academics don't always want to have but<br>he was associate dean maori for the<br>division of sciences from 2016 to 2018<br>where he<br>impressed by his development of our<br>strategic plan for the development of<br>our maori aspirations in the division<br>from the beginning of this year miles<br>took over as head of the department of<br>marine sciences<br>this has been a challenging time for the<br>department for many reasons<br>however his strong but understated hand<br>is evident as the department builds<br>towards a strong future<br>projects such as restoration of the mana<br>of the portobello marine laboratory<br>and its strategic importance to ataco<br>the peninsula<br>and the upper harbour with its<br>distinctive ecology<br>immediately come to mind continuing the<br>theme of beginnings<br>tonight professor lemay is going to<br>describe<br>how his insight from 20 years of<br>research<br>in marine larvae can help us understand<br>how our marine biota might adapt<br>to environmental change please join me<br>lemaire<br>thank you um it's really great great to<br>see everyone uh here tonight and um<br>it's great to see friends and especially<br>my family here um to<br>to um come along and support me and all<br>the friends and<br>and um colleagues at the university have<br>come along tonight so it's much<br>appreciated<br>tonight i want to talk a bit about um my<br>main focus which is on marine larvae<br>and the the journey i've had with those<br>those fascinating<br>organisms over the past 20 years in my<br>ongoing fascination with the<br>with the group and particularly um my<br>interest in how<br>the oceans um are changing and how the<br>changes in the ocean may influence<br>uh the these larval stages and what that<br>could go what that could mean for<br>so just a bit about what i'll talk about<br>i will just introduce<br>my phd because that's where my passion<br>for larvae<br>started and then i'll talk a wee bit<br>about about environmental change and so<br>the sorts of changes that are occurring<br>in the ocean and what they're going to<br>mean<br>for for um for<br>for for larvae and how that could in<br>turn influence<br>marine populations and i particularly<br>want to stress the idea of moving away<br>from the work we've been doing in the<br>laboratory<br>into trying to find more real-world um<br>analogs and trying to understand what we<br>see in the laboratory<br>in terms of what it could actually mean<br>in the future which is a difficult thing<br>to do to take<br>laboratory work out into the real to the<br>real world<br>and i also want to touch on the idea<br>about adaptation and why it's important<br>that we<br>we think about adaptation when we think<br>about the work we're doing<br>and hopefully i'll uh i'll convince<br>are people comfortable that level of<br>light is just okay here and hopefully<br>i'll<br>i'll um convince you that that the<br>responses that larvae<br>are going to have to change in the ocean<br>such as temperature or<br>acidification are going to are going to<br>be real key drivers to changes in marine<br>populations<br>so before we get started i did want to<br>just give you a wee bit of background<br>and just remind people about<br>about the fascinating life cycle of<br>marine organisms<br>so most of us are are familiar with uh<br>marine life in terms of the adults so<br>this big benefit<br>starfish here most of us are familiar<br>with with the adult stages<br>abalone starfish sea which is crayfish<br>etc<br>but what most people probably aren't as<br>familiar with is the<br>is the way they reproduce and the<br>complex life cycles that that marine<br>species have<br>most marine species reproduce by these<br>these fantastic<br>beautiful larval stages they have these<br>these complex<br>life cycles that alternate between a<br>long-lived<br>large benthic adult stage and they have<br>these<br>these shorter lived planktonic larval<br>stages that are microscopic<br>they're they're typically in the water<br>column and they're typically feeding<br>stages<br>and for something like a starfish<br>they'll be in the water column for maybe<br>two or three weeks<br>they'll go through those those various<br>stages of development and then they'll<br>they'll metamorphose and into a little<br>starfish and they'll settle so they're<br>these complex<br>life cycles and and most marine<br>organisms have these complex<br>life cycles so ninety percent of marine<br>organisms have these complex life cycles<br>and these larval stages are very<br>sensitive to the environment<br>and they they they pretty much drive<br>most of the important<br>processes of marine populations<br>distributions abundances recruitment<br>processes<br>etc so they're they're very sensitive to<br>the environment and they're very<br>sensitive to environmental change the<br>and they are really fascinating these<br>are all just examples of of marine<br>larvae<br>you can see there's a whole range of<br>different forms here<br>almost all of these are microscopic all<br>of these you could almost<br>certainly pass through the eye of a<br>needle some of them you'll<br>you'll recognize bivalve larvae<br>um gastropod village larvae up the top<br>there<br>um the zazuri of of crabs etc some of<br>these are quite recognizable<br>um some of them are large the the<br>lobster larvae is relatively large they<br>can be as large as your hand<br>the octopus parallel army also<br>relatively large<br>but um but they're a fascinating<br>fascinating group and as i said i spent<br>much of my academic career<br>academic career studying many of these<br>different forms<br>here but they are also very important<br>um for marine populations apart from<br>being fascinating<br>um they they give us a window under the<br>evolution of animals some of the<br>more simple larval forms the coral<br>larval stages and the sponge lobby at<br>the top<br>interesting in terms of evolution of<br>animals<br>they also as i said drive population<br>dynamics<br>so the so the um the abundance the the<br>transport of this larvae the way they<br>survive<br>and the plankton will really drive<br>population dynamics they'll drive<br>recruitment they'll drive where species<br>populations end up connections between<br>populations genetic structures of<br>populations<br>are all driven by the transport and the<br>survival of these these larval stages<br>but down the bottom they're also very<br>very important in terms of the responses<br>that we're going to see in marine<br>populations to to change<br>because they're very sensitive to the<br>environment so they're sensitive to<br>temperature and food concentrations<br>they're sensitive to ocean chemistry<br>etc so much of my research recently has<br>been really<br>looking at how these larval stages are<br>responding to<br>change<br>so my my interest in in in larvae came<br>from my phd research and<br>the research was funded by i was<br>supported by by film aladdin off my back<br>who some of you<br>all know they were members of the<br>zoology in the marine science department<br>and at at the time of my phd there was a<br>there was a<br>a lot of interest in in sea urchins for<br>fishing so every kindness<br>croticus was a species that was was<br>potentially going to be fished in the<br>fjords<br>and as part of that as part of that<br>process of managing the fishery they<br>needed to know something about the<br>numbers of juveniles that were going to<br>be entering a population so they could<br>they could work out how many they could<br>take<br>and as so to work out um the number of<br>juveniles a number of small animals that<br>are entering a population so you can<br>work out how many you can take<br>you needed to know something about about<br>these complex life cycles<br>so my phd was really looking at<br>factors that were controlling<br>recruitment and that would be factors of<br>influencing the larval stage as you can<br>see they're these plutius larval stages<br>um food concentrations how they affected<br>the growth<br>and survival of the larvae how the<br>larvae were being moved around<br>and ocean currents etc<br>so that's where i really got my interest<br>in in larval ecology<br>and larval biology so that was just<br>real fundamental type fisheries research<br>and<br>fundamental marine ecology ecological<br>work there wasn't any real thought on<br>on climate change at that stage<br>but of course as i as i went through my<br>phd i became much more aware of<br>environmental change and changes that<br>were occurring<br>in the ocean and we now know there are<br>lots of changes that are occurring<br>the oceans are warming the oceans are<br>acidifying they're taking up carbon<br>dioxide and acidifying<br>uh they're stratifying these changes in<br>productivity<br>there's increases in uv light in some<br>regions of the planet<br>and we can see that in our our own<br>backyard that's the the<br>the top graph there is just showing<br>reductions in sea water ph off the coast<br>of otago here and the munich transect so<br>the oceans are taking up carbon dioxide<br>and acidifying and we know temperatures<br>sea temperatures are<br>increasing around our our backyard<br>the bottom figure there has shown the<br>increase in temperature<br>around new zealand in the last century<br>and that map they're just showing how<br>much warmer the waters are in terms of<br>increases in<br>temperature per day per decade so we<br>know the oceans are warming they're<br>acidifying their<br>their productivity is changing and i was<br>really interested in knowing what<br>those sorts of changes are going to mean<br>for the larval stages of of<br>something like this this abalone here<br>so these power populations are going to<br>they're going to be influenced by change<br>but<br>we're really interested in knowing what<br>are the the effects that the changes are<br>going to have on the larval stages and<br>if the<br>the larvae don't survive if the if those<br>stages in the life cycle decrease and<br>survival then these populations are<br>really going to suffer<br>so that was where my interest in and the<br>effects of environmental change on these<br>these larvae occurred and i've dedicated<br>a lot a lot of my research over the past<br>um 15 20 years or so looking at<br>effects of of of change on larvae using<br>these elaborate<br>laboratory experiments and we've we've<br>been very good at rearing larvae<br>in the in the lab and you can see on the<br>left here it's just an example on the<br>sort of<br>experiments we run at the marine station<br>where we're we're in<br>rearing lava and we're looking at the<br>effects of ph and we can do all these<br>these elaborate experiments in the lab<br>where we for example can<br>look at species of sea urchins from all<br>around the the planet we can read the<br>larvae under<br>under present day ph conditions and then<br>we can rear them under ph conditions<br>that might occur in 300 years and you<br>can see that the larvae are smaller<br>and they clearly don't like reductions<br>in ph<br>and we can also expose them to uv and we<br>know that they don't like uv and you can<br>see they grow slower and<br>their development is abnormal and we can<br>do more even more<br>experiments where we increase<br>temperature and we reduce ph and we can<br>look at the<br>interaction between those two we can see<br>sometimes a bit of warming is actually<br>beneficial<br>but if you add um if you had reduced ph<br>it doesn't go too well<br>so lots of lots of interesting<br>experiments and we can raise larvae<br>efficiently in the lab we're very good<br>at it and we can do all sorts of<br>experiments<br>but these are just laboratory<br>experiments and in very<br>how do we interpret these results in the<br>real world larvae<br>exposed to a much more complicated<br>system than sitting in a<br>in a jar or a beaker in the lab so i was<br>really interested in<br>trying to see what these laboratory<br>experiments actually mean in the real<br>world<br>and the other thing that was worrying me<br>about these experiments was there's no<br>potential for<br>acclimation or adaptation what we're<br>doing is we're taking<br>larvae from present day conditions and<br>we're suddenly exposing them to<br>conditions in 300 years time we're<br>expecting them to respond<br>in some way so there's no potential for<br>reclamation or adaptation so<br>some of them the recent experiments<br>we're doing is trying to<br>add reclamation and adaptation into the<br>so i do need to take a step sideways<br>because during my phd i i<br>also had the the the luck and the<br>privilege of of<br>spending my summers or many of my<br>summers in the antarctic<br>and that was working with professor art<br>devries from the<br>university of illinois that's a<br>fantastic<br>man and he's a legend in antarctic<br>biology and he's a legend in fish<br>biology he's the he's the professor who<br>journalist post-doc<br>discovered the anti-freeze proteins and<br>an antarctic fish<br>so antarctic fish live in very cold<br>water so cold they need<br>antifreeze proteins all their blood<br>freezes so i would travel down to the<br>antarctic and help art catch<br>fish and bleed the fish into all sorts<br>of interesting experiments with art<br>around these anti-freeze proteins but my<br>heart was always with<br>marine invertebrates and and larvae so<br>although fish were interesting enough<br>i was i was much more interested in<br>marine larvae<br>i didn't tell out there of course um and<br>the other thing that was big news at the<br>time<br>during the 90s was the it was the ozone<br>hole and<br>and um i was very much interested in<br>thinking while i was working for art<br>what the<br>what that ozone hole and what that<br>increase in uv may be doing for<br>marine life down there and particularly<br>of course marine larvae<br>so i kind of store that in the back of<br>my mind<br>and became very much interested in the<br>effects of uv on<br>on on marine life so as so as richard<br>said<br>once i finished my phd i took up a<br>postdoc in<br>the us and and an amazing place called<br>the friday<br>harbour marine labs which are the<br>university of washington's marine labs<br>and they're up on the san juan islands<br>which is just on the border with<br>with canada and that's the the marine<br>lab there<br>it was at the time and still is probably<br>the leading<br>one of the leading institutes for<br>studying marine larvae and the staff<br>there and the academics here are amazing<br>group of<br>of researchers but the the post-op was<br>all about looking at the effects of uv<br>on larvae<br>on marine life so i was very much<br>interested in learning<br>the sorts of research you can do in that<br>space and<br>in particular it was looking at<br>sunscreen compounds so these<br>compounds called microsporin like amino<br>acids so marine larvae<br>when they're in the water column they're<br>getting exposed to to uv<br>and they actually have sunscreens so<br>we've got melanin<br>these these animals have have sunscreens<br>and that the particular sunscreen these<br>these larvae and these<br>these invertebrates have a microscope<br>like amino acids<br>they they we can't produce them no<br>animal can produce these compounds but<br>what they do is the sea urchins the the<br>species here strongholds and try to<br>strobe against us you can see the sea<br>urchin here<br>what it does is it grazes on the kelp<br>and the kelp produces the sunscreens to<br>protect itself<br>and the urchins will take those<br>sunscreens out these mucous borne like<br>amino acids they'll take them out<br>and the urchins will put them in their<br>eggs and they'll put them in the larvae<br>so when the larvae are in the water<br>column they'll be<br>protected by by these sunscreens<br>so we did a lot of experiments looking<br>at the dynamics and the efficiency of<br>those sunscreen<br>compounds and and what there that was a<br>fascinating time<br>we looked at carotenoids and antioxidant<br>compounds<br>in in the offspring as well and i've<br>actually continued with the work on maas<br>we do it locally now we've been working<br>on<br>um sunscreen compounds in the local<br>krill tiffany's australis and<br>and also had a phd student who finished<br>up recently but he was working on<br>sunscreens in<br>in the um the local sounding so it was a<br>it was a fascinating time and it was<br>it was a great um time to learn a lot<br>about the fixer uv<br>on this offspring<br>but um but during the during the<br>post-doc i obviously had a chance to go<br>to several conferences<br>and i met a another gentleman<br>professor mike lesser from the<br>university of new hampshire and we<br>discussed<br>as you do with our research interests<br>and as it turned out we had a lot of<br>very similar interests we were thinking<br>in the same way and<br>in particular mike lisa and myself<br>were quite interested in the effects of<br>of the ozone hole and the increase in uv<br>and the<br>in the antarctic so um<br>building on that myself and mike um put<br>together some applications and we<br>managed to get support<br>to go and work in the antarctic for what<br>turned out to be quite a number of years<br>looking at the effects of ozone and uv<br>on<br>on on on marine life and particularly on<br>the larval stages<br>and that research really blossomed out<br>and and it was great that we had people<br>like craig marshall and david burrito at<br>the university here that helped<br>with the work and we did work on dna<br>repair dna damage<br>how quickly antarctic species repair<br>their dna and<br>oxidative stress et cetera so there was<br>a whole suite of<br>work that we did over there um six or<br>seven years<br>but one of the key bits of work that we<br>did was to actually<br>look to see how much damage and how much<br>how much damage increase in uv could be<br>doing to marine life actually in situ<br>so not too worried about working in the<br>lab but actually putting embryos out<br>under the sea ice and and seeing what<br>kind of damage they might be<br>experiencing<br>as the ozone hole went over so we we<br>started a dive program and we went up<br>the icy edge and took measurements of uv<br>then we dive under the ice and we put<br>out these<br>these little experimental racks you<br>could maybe just make out<br>which had which had sea urchin embryos<br>on them<br>and we could then see what kind of<br>responses they were having to<br>to the ozone um ozone hole and the<br>so it was it was it was exciting four<br>years of of diving i haven't dived down<br>there for many years now and<br>probably never will again but it was<br>certainly exciting at the time<br>um the cool thing or the interesting<br>thing about the ozone hole is<br>it's a very dynamic structure and you<br>you see what i mean if you look at the<br>figures on the left so<br>the the map of the antarctic on the left<br>there's got that big purple<br>hole in the middle that's the ozone hole<br>the orange dot is our research<br>um that's mcmurdo sound that's we were<br>we were based<br>and what you can see is that sometimes<br>you can be under the ozone hole<br>and sometimes you can be outside it and<br>it can be quite a rapid switch<br>because of the dynamic wobbly nature of<br>the ozone hole<br>so for example in on the 26th of october<br>we're outside the ozone hole<br>normal ozone um just normal levels of uv<br>and then a week later the ozone hole<br>spins over and suddenly you've got<br>elevated uv because you've got<br>reductions in<br>and ozone concentrations<br>so we can use that as a real natural<br>experiment we can put our experiments<br>out<br>before the ozone hole comes over we can<br>measure dna damage<br>and then we can we can measure um damage<br>and and and what have as their ozone<br>hole comes over the<br>the um the study site and that's what<br>these figures here are i've just taken<br>just a couple of examples of of the<br>sorts of<br>interesting results you can get the<br>the these are the racks that we would<br>put out under the under the ice here and<br>those little bags have got the embryos<br>in them the top figure here don't worry<br>about the two left bars they're just<br>controls but<br>the the bars on the right the green bar<br>is showing how much protein damage that<br>you get from<br>from uv is occurring when there's normal<br>ozone<br>and you can see that the blue bar when<br>the ozone hole comes over the amount of<br>protein damage that<br>you can associate with the with the<br>ozone hole and the increase in uv<br>almost doubles so as that ozone hole<br>goes over you get a lot of damage to<br>to proteins and lipids and dna and lots<br>of different<br>sorts of damage and we also see the<br>um you can see the way that the embryos<br>have to start<br>repairing dna damage they get dna damage<br>and they repair it<br>so on the these purple images here are<br>embryos that have been treated with<br>a process in the lab which basically<br>colorizes the amount of dna damage and<br>the amount of dna repair that's going on<br>so the darker the color the more dna<br>damage and more dna repair that's going<br>on<br>in these embryos so on the left you can<br>see under normal ozone conditions<br>there's a bit of<br>repair going on bit of damage but when<br>that ozone hole comes over you can see<br>the dna damage and the dna repair goes<br>up<br>remarkably they have to start photo<br>repairing their dna<br>so we know that that ozone hole damages<br>the dna we know these embryos have to<br>respond<br>they have to repair that damage they get<br>um they have<br>oxidative stress they get lots of<br>increases in mortality and<br>so there's real issues for those embryos<br>in those those regions as the ozone hole<br>goes over<br>and that would be affecting the the<br>survival of those offspring and<br>so that was so after after<br>eight or nine years working in the<br>antarctic i thought it might have been<br>good to actually<br>go somewhere warm for a show and uh you<br>couldn't really go anyplace warmer than<br>south of townsville so<br>um so in 2010 i took up research and<br>study leave with<br>my family came up with me which was<br>fantastic<br>and i started working with a really good<br>friend and colleague<br>dr sven utica at the australian<br>institute of marine sciences<br>yeah and it was a sven i'd met at<br>numerous conferences before<br>so as i said the ames is just south of<br>townsville<br>it's a it's a federal institute that's<br>solely focused on<br>working on on the coral reef so they do<br>lots of work all through the the great<br>barrier reef and eva even over on the<br>the west coast of australia and me and<br>sven<br>have really sparked off a fantastic<br>career that uh<br>relationship uh his colleagues over the<br>past um decade and it's still is still<br>going on in fact i got<br>graph set over from today to look at um<br>but lots of work we did one of the the<br>interesting<br>projects we started was working on this<br>this big starfish the acanthaster<br>planky ice the crown of thorns starfish<br>it's a very big starfish it's maybe half<br>a metre across the biggest<br>biggest starfish i'm very toxic so if<br>you see one on a reef you certainly<br>don't want to touch it if you<br>um you'll be in pain for days and at the<br>worst you can you can even die if you<br>get enough spines in you<br>but they're a wee bit naughty these<br>starfish because their populations go<br>through<br>big swings big population swings<br>or outbreaks and so you'll get a period<br>when there's very few staff i should be<br>lucky if you find one<br>and then you get these huge population<br>outbreaks<br>and when these outbreaks occur these<br>corals specialize these these<br>these starfish specialize in eating<br>corals and they'll<br>they'll start eating the coral and they<br>do an immense amount of damage to the<br>the coral reef in fact they'll reduce<br>coral by up to 25 percent<br>cover on those those barrier barrier<br>reefs<br>and these outbreaks these plagues if you<br>want<br>if you want to call them of these<br>starfishes it's all driven by<br>the larval stages so it comes back to my<br>interest in<br>in these these populations the changes<br>we see are because of changes<br>in the survival and the growth of the<br>larvae because conditions on the reef<br>periodically<br>change in such a way that they're<br>favorable for the for the larvae and<br>you'll get these big<br>big outbreaks in fact the whole process<br>is actually driven by runoff<br>and and nutrients on the reef so on on<br>the figure here this is a map showing<br>central queensland and<br>those red patches are reefs on the<br>barrier reef which are affected by<br>crown of thorns outbreaks and you can<br>see there's lots of rivers up the coast<br>there<br>and periodically you'll get a big<br>rainfall year a big rainfall event<br>and it'll flush nutrients onto the reef<br>and those nutrients<br>fuel phytoplankton blooms and in turn<br>the phytoplankton blooms then allow the<br>there's more food for the for these<br>crownathorns larvae they'll grow faster<br>they'll survive<br>uh much better and you'll get this big<br>recruitment and you'll get this big<br>outbreak of<br>of crown of thorns in fact the<br>relationship is so<br>so good between the the<br>rainfall and the crown reforms outbreaks<br>they can actually predict crownathon's<br>outbreaks simply just from rainfall data<br>and that's what this this figure here is<br>showing um<br>queensland rainfall over maybe 50 years<br>so it's just cumulative rainfall for<br>different years and some uses more rain<br>than others<br>but um what it's showing is that the the<br>years where there were crown of thorns<br>outbreaks are all those years that are<br>in color<br>so the years where you've had these<br>outbreaks have all been associated with<br>big<br>rainfall events and there's a big<br>outbreak occurring at the moment and<br>that was associated with a rainfall<br>event that occurred a few years ago<br>so they can predict these outbreaks<br>and the managers are all geared up ready<br>to go and it's all it's all driven<br>that's the crown of thorns larval stages<br>there it's all driven by the<br>the um it's all driven by the survival<br>of these larvae<br>as phytoplankton um<br>phytoplankton numbers increased because<br>so the work we were doing was fam was<br>actually<br>we were interested in knowing what are<br>these dynamics going to look like in the<br>the coasts of queensland are not only<br>changing and rainfall but they're also<br>the waters around the barrier reef are<br>warming so the conditions that<br>are driving these outbreaks today are<br>going to actually be quite different in<br>the future because of<br>of warming and potentially changes in<br>and rainfall patterns<br>so sven and i did a lot of experiments<br>where we<br>um we were raising these these crown of<br>thorns larvae<br>under different food concentrations and<br>you can see the<br>the vertical axis here is the<br>probability of the larvae going through<br>their<br>their development through the settlement<br>and you can see there's a nice<br>relationship between food concentration<br>and<br>and probability of of of reaching a<br>certain stage and that's what we know<br>that's that that<br>confirms that pattern that high food<br>means these largely survive much better<br>and you'll get big recruitment<br>but what we're interested in was<br>actually<br>what happens to this relationship<br>between food and survival when<br>when you add predicted warming events so<br>we know the reef is going to increase by<br>maybe two degrees<br>by the end of this the sum the century<br>so we were running experiments where we<br>not only adjusted the food concentration<br>but we did those<br>experiments under under different<br>temperatures so<br>temperatures today and temperatures in<br>the future so we could start modeling<br>and start<br>developing models that predict um how<br>fast they'll develop so the<br>the bar on the figure on the left there<br>is the time it takes to reach a certain<br>stage as food concentrations go up<br>but also as you add warming along the<br>vertical on the horizontal axis<br>to temperatures that you might expect<br>towards the end of the of the century<br>and similarly we can look how the<br>probability of survival<br>um changes not only as the food<br>concentrations go up<br>as we know it's important today but also<br>as the<br>temperatures go up and we can see the<br>probability of survival<br>um increases from just say for example<br>the highest food concentrations<br>probability of survival increases from<br>maybe 10<br>up to about 30 under under future<br>conditions<br>so we can use this data to start<br>predicting what these outbreaks are<br>going to look like in the future<br>and this is very important for managers<br>of these reefs because they<br>as we know the barrier reefs and all<br>sorts of stress from bleaching and<br>crown of thorns is something they just<br>don't want to have to deal with as well<br>so we're providing some information to<br>help them model<br>changes in the future to these these<br>coral crown of thorns<br>so the other um the other fortunate<br>um thing about visiting ames was they<br>also were running a<br>quite an interesting research program on<br>carbon dioxide vents and this comes back<br>to the<br>the idea i i mentioned at the start of<br>the of the talk that<br>it's all very well to do these nice<br>elaborate experiments in the lab<br>but they are just lab experiments and<br>they're very controlled experiments<br>and what we're always interested in is<br>looking at more realistic<br>and scenarios or more realistic future<br>analogs<br>and one of the the issues for oceans is<br>acidification so carbon dioxide<br>concentration is increasing in the ocean<br>so we're looking for analogues of future<br>ocean conditions in terms of<br>regions where there's elevated carbon<br>dioxide and there are some really unique<br>and unusual places in the ocean where<br>you do get<br>you do get analog for the future<br>okay next time okay so and we do get<br>analogs of the future unless<br>these are unusual places in the ocean<br>where there's carbon dioxide that's been<br>released from the the sea floor<br>and it's and it's their carbon dioxide<br>is mixing with the mixing with the sea<br>water and it's producing<br>water chemistry and ocean ph conditions<br>similar to what you'd expect<br>towards the end of the of the century<br>and beyond and aims were working up<br>in papua new guinea in a place called<br>milne province and the melm province is<br>there's some really unusual coral reefs<br>which have got carbon dioxide<br>bubbling through them and you can see on<br>the right there that's one of these<br>reefs and there's an instrument here<br>that's actually measuring<br>ph we have local analogues as well so<br>white island<br>um we went on a on a big research trip<br>up there<br>three four years ago led by abby smith<br>and and what happened we were also<br>interested in<br>in the the carbon dioxide seeps around<br>the the edge of<br>um of whakari white island there because<br>they again are analogues of the future<br>so these are really interesting places<br>for us to try and understand what<br>and how marine populations may respond<br>to to future conditions<br>so ames ames were running a massive um<br>research program up there and they were<br>looking at a whole suite of of processed<br>corals and<br>and and what have but my research has<br>always been a bit more focused and i was<br>interested in the sea urchins<br>and have at the reefs so this um siege<br>in here kind of metro mafia it's a it's<br>called a coral bora or a rock or urchin<br>if anyone if you dive up in the in the<br>reef you'll see these are very common<br>and they they make these little grooves<br>you can just make out grooves on this<br>coral here and these are the grooves<br>these these these urchins make because<br>they graze on the coral<br>they eat the coral and they digest the<br>organic material out of the coral<br>but they actually will bore into the<br>coral insulin rock borers<br>so we were really interested in knowing<br>how these little urchins were surviving<br>on these on these reefs that had<br>high carbon dioxide concentrations and<br>reduce ph<br>because all the lab experiments have<br>predicted that they wouldn't do very<br>well<br>but we noticed that they actually<br>growing quite well<br>so we we started out quite a bit of<br>research on the adults how they're<br>responding<br>we were also interested in how the<br>larvae might be responding under more<br>natural conditions<br>so during the um during those research<br>trips<br>adult merchants were brought out from<br>the from the water<br>they're easy urchins are very very easy<br>to spawn and very easy to raise the<br>offspring<br>so up the top there you can see all<br>these urchins that are being spawned<br>and then we got the eggs and sperm and<br>we we mix them and you can get the<br>little<br>urchin embryos up the top there and then<br>you can plant those out in the field<br>and you can leave them and you can see<br>how well they they survive<br>and we plant them in these little wee<br>tubes these little tubes have got we<br>mesh windows on them<br>so they'll um they'll let water and food<br>and<br>and and what have passed through so they<br>the larvae<br>experience these natural conditions but<br>the larvae are retained in there because<br>there's a wee mesh window<br>and we can so we can put the larvae out<br>under places where there's co2 bubbling<br>like you can see in the picture there<br>or you can put them in control<br>conditions and we can start to compare<br>how the larvae may respond to future<br>ocean conditions<br>and these are some of the results so we<br>can see how big they grow<br>and we can see if they're growing<br>abnormally because of asymmetric<br>development so these are these are<br>future analogues<br>for for what for for how long he could<br>respond<br>in the future and just really briefly<br>again i won't go through the results in<br>any detail but you can see the larvae<br>do respond negatively to reduce ph in<br>natural conditions<br>the the figure on the left here is just<br>differences in ph so<br>eight would be the ph on a on the<br>pristine reef and then 7.4 is these<br>reefs that have got the co2 bubbling<br>through them and on the left graph you<br>can see that the size of the larvae<br>decreases as you go from ambient to<br>to reduced ph reefs so they don't grow<br>very well it's<br>exposed to these high co2 conditions<br>and similarly the asymmetry goes up as<br>you go from normal to<br>reduced ph so they grow abnormally<br>so these were the these were exactly the<br>kind of results that we predicted from<br>the lab<br>that you actually see in natural<br>conditions<br>and in fact that was one of the<br>motivations was to see how the lab<br>and the fuel results matched up so this<br>figure on the on the right here is<br>showing<br>the results of a whole lot of<br>experiments that people have done not<br>only us but<br>other researchers where they've raised<br>ch and larvae in<br>different phs from normal through to to<br>reduce ph<br>they've looked at the degree to which<br>the arm growth is reduced as a measure<br>of<br>of of a deleterious effect and then you<br>can plot it and then that line you can<br>predict<br>the sort of response and now field<br>results are in the blue the blue dots<br>are the results from our field results<br>and you can see they match up very well<br>with the lab predictions which is<br>encouraging<br>so that the lab experiments although<br>they're very controlled very<br>artificial they actually do provide<br>quite a useful<br>tool for predicting the sorts of<br>systems<br>okay so and as i mentioned<br>earlier um in the talk the other issue<br>with those lab experiments<br>is that they they don't account for<br>acclimation or adaptation<br>what we're doing is we're taking animals<br>from present-day conditions and then<br>we're expecting their offspring to<br>survive<br>all these treatments that we give that<br>might represent conditions in two or<br>three hundred years from from today<br>so we were interested in and trying to<br>tease out the potential for adaptation<br>and we're especially interested in<br>adaptation<br>and polar species so again i still<br>maintain a strong polar<br>research program and in particular we<br>we're interested in adaptation on these<br>really pretty starfish called<br>intestinal validus they're very<br>important species<br>in the antarctic they're very common on<br>the seafloor<br>so they're an ideal species to work with<br>but starfish are also ideal because<br>they're very simple animals<br>that we can work with in the lab<br>so we had this idea that we were<br>interested in<br>and and work in an adaptation but<br>adaptative adaptation experiments take<br>quite a long time<br>so we're talking experiments that would<br>take um three years to run<br>so we'd expose an animal for three years<br>to future conditions and we'd see how<br>they were acclimating<br>and we would see how their offspring<br>might be performing so if an adult is<br>red and warm temperatures does it<br>produce offspring which are better<br>adapted to warming<br>but we can't i clearly can't spend three<br>years down in the antarctic it wouldn't<br>it wouldn't go down too well at home<br>that's for sure so um<br>so we we we applied for funding and we<br>applied for for permission to bring<br>starfish back to new zealand so we could<br>run these experiments in new zealand<br>and after getting funding from the<br>university of brussels and working with<br>a great colleague antonia aguero<br>and getting support from the new zealand<br>antarctic research institute<br>etc we finally got permission and<br>funding to bring this starfish back to<br>new zealand<br>so the photo there is is us the day<br>before we're traveling back from scott<br>base<br>it's a scot-based lab with 600 starfish<br>that we'd collected<br>that were ready to be flown back to new<br>zealand<br>and the the orange boxes there are the<br>the boxes full of starfish that are<br>sitting in these<br>these big us air force cargo planes and<br>we're we're coming back<br>with all these starfish and the pilot's<br>always quite interested in knowing<br>what's in the boxes and<br>and uh so i'd actually show them the<br>starfish and they thought it was pretty<br>funny<br>anyway and then so we got them back to<br>new zealand and then we<br>we got a pc tour or a quarantine lab at<br>the marine station at portobello<br>so the portobello marine lab has a whole<br>lab full of antarctic starfish<br>and each one of those cabinets has got<br>starfish that have been grown in<br>different temperatures<br>ranging from ambient conditions<br>so about -2 which is what the starfish<br>live at<br>and then the antarctic all the way<br>through to four degrees<br>and we've been rearing them for two to<br>three years<br>and we're just monitoring how those<br>adults respond<br>to to warming are they are they<br>acclimating are they<br>and then we would spawn them and look at<br>their offspring and see is there any<br>evidence of adaptation from one<br>so the way we do that actually is use<br>something called a dynamic energy budget<br>modeling which i won't go into any<br>detail but i mentioned the starfish<br>are really useful animals they're very<br>simple<br>the animal starfish takes up food energy<br>and it will allocate that energy to<br>growth or to growing arms and<br>maintaining its body<br>it'll store some energy in a big<br>structure called the polar oxicum<br>but then it will also allocate energy to<br>reproduction<br>so an animal has a choice between where<br>it allocates the the energy<br>and you can express that in the<br>mathematical formula or diagram on the<br>right there<br>but we were really interested among<br>other things and knowing if you stress<br>an animal out if it's grown under<br>future conditions does it actually start<br>to alter the way the animal reproduces<br>so how much energy is it putting into<br>reproduction<br>um is it producing offspring that are<br>more<br>tolerant of warmer temperatures which<br>would be a good news story so<br>the animals are adapting to warming so<br>they're getting um<br>they're producing offspring which are<br>so we um so we've ran these experiments<br>we spawned the animals and there's the<br>larval stages of the starfish<br>and then we we look to see how the<br>offspring would respond to<br>to to warming if they came from ambient<br>adults<br>or from adults that have been red in the<br>in the warmer temperatures<br>and you can see uh unfortunately they<br>don't show any potential adaptation in<br>fact it's a bad news story<br>the the larvae in the on the blue lines<br>of larvae that have that have<br>grown across um three or four months<br>they're increasing in size they're much<br>bigger than the larvae that have come<br>from<br>adults which have been grown in warm<br>temperatures<br>what happens is the adults are stressed<br>out they're not putting enough energy<br>they're not putting<br>resources into their offspring it's<br>actually a bad news story<br>they're more worried about dealing with<br>the stresses of warmer temperatures and<br>their offspring are actually suffering<br>and they have they produce smaller eggs<br>and the the content of the eggs is<br>is poorer so that's not a good news<br>story<br>for that particular species okay so<br>just just one more story and then then<br>i'll<br>i'll finish up so just to show you how<br>important temperature changes are<br>for for marine populations and an<br>interesting story in our own backyard<br>so we live in a region which is one of<br>the fastest warming on the planet in<br>terms of ocean change<br>and it's because the the warm east<br>australian current is<br>is intensifying and it's flying further<br>south and it's bringing warm water down<br>from the tropics<br>and it's heating up places like tasmania<br>significantly<br>so the water temperatures around<br>tasmania are increasing significantly<br>and we already said temperatures around<br>new zealand are also<br>increasing so in a region of warming<br>temperatures<br>and that's affecting the surgeon on the<br>on the left here citrus theftness rogers<br>eye<br>so this sea urchin in response to<br>warming has expanded its range<br>significantly and it's a very well<br>documented expansion<br>it wasn't present in tasmania before the<br>1970s<br>it was founded in bath straight in the<br>60s and you can see the urchins have<br>marched<br>down the coast we haven't marched<br>they've actually just turned up<br>around the coast and so they're down the<br>bottom by 2005.<br>the issue is that those urchins are now<br>modifying the ecosystem of tasmania<br>significantly<br>the urchins um will eat the kelp<br>so when the nutrients turn up they'll<br>graze the kelp they'll reduce the kelp<br>forest<br>and they'll convert productive diverse<br>kelp beds into<br>urchin barrens so it's it's not a great<br>story the warming is driving these<br>population expansions<br>and it's modifying the whole ecosystem<br>and it's all driven by the larvae<br>it's a very interesting story so on the<br>left here is a figure showing the<br>relationship between larval survival of<br>the species<br>as a function of water temperature and<br>hopefully you can see that they've got a<br>very clear temperature tolerance<br>of 12 degrees temperatures colder than<br>12 degrees they don't like<br>if you cross 12 degrees they they grow<br>very well<br>and as the waters in in tasmania have<br>warmed and they've crossed that 12<br>degree threshold over the past<br>60 years the conditions have suddenly<br>been suitable for the larvae<br>and that's what's driving this whole<br>migration of urchin south is because the<br>water temperature just crossed<br>a couple of degrees warmer across that<br>12 degree threshold<br>and suddenly these larvae can survive<br>so we have the same species in new<br>zealand and we really didn't know much<br>about the species until<br>um until recently and and i i managed to<br>to recruit a fantastic student danilo<br>piccarino from<br>from italy and and we worked together<br>on for his phd on finding out about the<br>biology of the species of new zealand<br>so lots of information on growth and<br>reproduction but we're also interested<br>in this idea about<br>temperature and larval responses<br>affecting<br>species distributions so we did similar<br>work where we looked at the temperature<br>threshold of the larvae they're about 15<br>degrees the larvae need temperatures<br>warmer than 15 degrees<br>to survive and that top and that<br>figure on the right here shows the<br>distribution of the central stiffness<br>populations and<br>and with respect to water temperatures<br>the line of 15 degrees so any<br>temperature warmer than 15 degrees<br>you'll find<br>the urchin populations so just like<br>australia they need temperatures warmer<br>so it's a nice another it's very clear<br>story the issue of course is<br>is that new zealand temperatures new<br>zealand waters are warming<br>so on the on the left here are<br>predictions of sea temperatures in new<br>zealand<br>by the end of the century and the top<br>one they're predicting warming of about<br>three degrees<br>by the end of the century and if you add<br>three degrees onto the present-day<br>temperatures<br>you would have winter temperatures um<br>that would be suitable for that species<br>in the<br>outline in the blue so instead of the<br>species being restricted to<br>the the eastern coast of the north<br>island suddenly the<br>potential for it to be much more<br>widespread and<br>if it follows the same model that we saw<br>in australia then<br>the species could well spread and be<br>interesting to know the ecological<br>okay so last last um<br>sliding so just the final um story then<br>is around<br>uh another key aspect of of larval<br>ecology and that's that settlement<br>so larval settlement's very specific so<br>when the larvae finish their their<br>development they have to settle<br>and they often have to be very specific<br>on where they settle<br>and for something like an abalone it's<br>very specific they only settle on<br>certain species of coralline algae<br>so as part of the speed current project<br>which has been looking at the effects of<br>acidification on<br>on marine life we're interested in<br>knowing how the settlement<br>and the life cycle of the abalone is<br>going to be affected so we had<br>we've had our phd students anna and<br>natalie yester looking at how the the<br>the settlement substrate was going to be<br>altered under future conditions and how<br>that might affect the<br>settlement of the of the power and<br>indeed you get a strong effect so<br>the the coralline algae response the<br>acidification and that in turn affects<br>the<br>the the power settlement so again that's<br>another key part of the life cycle that<br>okay so this is certainly the last slide<br>so this will be the last slide<br>and hopefully um these are just these<br>are just maps showing the future<br>conditions of<br>of our season in 100 years so the the<br>nice<br>colored images there are showing that<br>the ocean ph is what it is present day<br>and and what it's going to be in the<br>future<br>so ocean ph is going to drop i've<br>already talked about temperatures<br>increasing by up to three degrees around<br>the coast<br>and also we're getting big changes in<br>productivity these are all changes that<br>directly<br>will influence the larval stages so i<br>think<br>hopefully i've convinced you that that<br>actually the studying these larval<br>stages are very important and trying to<br>understand how marine populations are<br>going to respond<br>in the future and we can do lots of<br>elaborate lab experiments to show that<br>but<br>also trying to look for more realistic<br>scenarios<br>and i will just say thanks to all my<br>university<br>um friends and and colleagues um<br>particularly the staff of the marine<br>science department and the marine lab<br>as i said i've got a a real fondness for<br>the for the marine stations a huge asset<br>for the university<br>all our research vessel and the crew did<br>a fantastic job<br>and and just why the university i mean i<br>as i've said to richard before i<br>i can't believe i get to work in such an<br>amazing place and i get paid to do this<br>job it is a it's a super place to work<br>and i<br>i really do feel privileged to be here<br>so thank you and thanks for everyone<br>well it's uh my name is steve wing and i<br>have the privilege to to work with miles<br>um<br>i also um have the privilege to formally<br>thank you for your<br>for your lecture um uh brilliant talk is<br>really interesting stuff and we live in<br>a time of unprecedented change in our<br>oceans and<br>and those of you in the marine science<br>department know this it's the oceans are<br>warming they're becoming more acidic as<br>the oceans are sucking up co2<br>there are changes in the atmosphere<br>there changes in the<br>nutrients that go into our coastal zone<br>and eutrophication and so on<br>and much of that is easy relatively easy<br>to measure those physical changes<br>show up on satellites we can see color<br>pictures of all that<br>stuff the the uncertainty lies<br>the real uncertainty lies in how<br>the ocean ecosystem is going to respond<br>to those changes<br>and and miles's research is at the<br>forefront of understanding those<br>patterns<br>when you see changes in the adults of<br>something<br>it has to do with the kids it's it's<br>nothing about the adults<br>and and so uh so miles has has given us<br>a window<br>into that very important change in<br>into a community that that supports most<br>of the biodiversity in new zealand<br>all of our fisheries our aquaculture<br>everything about<br>this island nation so um it's my<br>privilege to<br>on behalf of the university give you<br>this little memento for this day<br>and uh and to congratulate you on
