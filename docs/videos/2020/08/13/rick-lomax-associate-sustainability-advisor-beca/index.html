currently working at the ministry of<br>health as principal advisor for<br>sustainability<br>in the dhb performance support and<br>infrastructure team<br>and for those of you who don't know me i<br>did used to work at county's manukau<br>dhb sustainability manager for several<br>years before<br>this new role we are delighted to be<br>here<br>and providing this webinar series to you<br>all and<br>i'm really honored to be here um to<br>facilitate today's webinar<br>we have rick lomax presenting today and<br>let me start with a brief bio which i'm<br>just gonna read that's probably what you<br>can see me glancing to the side<br>rick has been working in sustainability<br>and health for over seven years<br>providing consultancy services with a<br>three-year stint<br>at the nhs sustainable development unit<br>where he led the nhs's carbon air<br>pollution<br>water and waste footprint work which was<br>published in 2018<br>pretty phenomenal rick basically<br>undertook the analysis<br>and trajectory modeling which led to the<br>nhs<br>setting a net zero cabin target by 2050<br>and the fleet air pollution target by<br>2030<br>big kudos there goes to rick um<br>we were very lucky to have him he joined<br>he came over to new zealand<br>um just under a year ago and he joined<br>becca<br>and he's actually working with quite a<br>few dhbs and hospitals at the moment<br>and much more generally across the<br>sectors<br>so one more thing can i please remind<br>you to ask your questions<br>in the questions and answers box as we<br>go along<br>and we will ask rick to address your<br>questions at the end of his session<br>that's it from me over to you rick thank<br>you very much<br>awesome thank you for the introduction<br>debbie farty kind um<br>hopefully you can try and share screen<br>can you see screen<br>awesome got a thumbs up from devi um<br>yeah fantastic i'm<br>really really grateful for the<br>opportunity to to speak to you all today<br>and talk through some of the stuff that<br>i was doing at the national health<br>service with the sdu<br>and i'm more going to focus on a very<br>practical example i've been working with<br>a new zealand utilities company to kind<br>of talk<br>through how you would create a net zero<br>carbon trajectory<br>and kind of the value and some of the<br>lessons learned and some of the things<br>that might help you on your journey as<br>well<br>so um so i'm gonna<br>talk through what basically took me two<br>years in the nhs to do in about three<br>minutes which is both exciting and<br>depressing that it took me two years but<br>um<br>what we did is we set out early doors<br>and the nhs had been<br>since 2007 i think it was been doing a<br>carbon baseline of the entire nhs<br>public health and social care system<br>so for an order of magnitude the total<br>footprint in 2017 was 27 megatons which<br>is about a third of the size of new<br>zealand's top emissions<br>so not small so we published this update<br>in 2018<br>that debbie mentioned then what we<br>started doing was moving from the<br>baseline assessment<br>into a trajectory so starting to look at<br>the historical missions on the dark blue<br>line<br>um over the last um 20 30 years from 20<br>no sorry from<br>1990 which is the base line year for the<br>uk's<br>um greenhouse gas target and we started<br>looking at what's the kind of do nothing<br>projection if we as a health sector<br>stand to the side and<br>not tackle climate change where might<br>our missions lead to<br>and it's a pretty horrific trajectory<br>and what that might mean for health<br>so we started to talk through what are<br>the things that we know is going to<br>happen nationally that the health sector<br>can leverage<br>uh which is the stuff in purple and we<br>wanted to look at what the health sector<br>could drive itself and really deliver<br>in terms of efficiency and looking at<br>more transformation so we did that piece<br>of work<br>and that involved into the um nhs<br>long-term plan so we got the nhs to sign<br>up to a net zero carbon target by 2050<br>um which was pretty um revolutionary for<br>the nhs to do<br>and we are working on the fact on the<br>basis that covers all emissions<br>so our direct emissions from energy<br>water and those sorts of things but also<br>all our indirect<br>emissions as well in terms of all<br>purchase goods and services<br>so it's a stupidly ambitious target but<br>we really wanted to set that aim<br>um and we'd rather fall short of a<br>really aspirational aim and not be<br>aspirational enough<br>but under the carbon target the national<br>carbon target for the nhs we set some<br>very specific goals<br>so we wanted to reduce the anaesthetic<br>gas carbon footprint by at least 45<br>percent in a couple of years<br>we wanted to reduce the carbon impact of<br>inhalers<br>by 50 over a five-year period<br>and that was going to also unlock um a<br>really significant<br>um financial saving around 15 and the<br>total nhs inhaler bill i think was 2.2<br>billion dollars in 2018<br>so it's not a small saving at all<br>what we also did was got a target in to<br>reduce air police<br>air pollution emissions from the nhs<br>fleet by 20<br>over a 10-year period as well so it's<br>really setting the macro level of what<br>we wanted to achieve but breaking it<br>down some really<br>um achievable um but um inspirational<br>kind of<br>aspects of what we could deliver in the<br>healthcare system<br>so that's evolved further since i've<br>left the sde and what they've set up now<br>is a net zero nhs commission so we're<br>re-evaluating<br>the evidence across the system so a<br>massive consultation exercise<br>to check is the wedges analysis that we<br>did earlier<br>in the trajectory analysis is that still<br>right or do we need to reframe that<br>because if you can notice in what we did<br>in 2018-19 there was still quite a<br>significant gap to get to the<br>an 80 reduction when we had the target<br>for an 8<br>reduction by 2050 there's an even bigger<br>gap to get to 2050<br>so the commission's um kind of role<br>is to um do some evidence gathering and<br>then re-update<br>oh that's unhelpful there we go<br>um so we're updating the the wedges<br>analysis or sorry the sdu without me are<br>updating the wedges analysis to see<br>um what this call of evidence is going<br>to provide and what more opportunities<br>are there across the nhs to reduce<br>emissions<br>and get to that 2050 target<br>one thing i just wanted to kind of share<br>is this<br>is the um a more detailed breakdown of<br>the 2017<br>um emissions i think the big thing to<br>note is<br>the big problems were in the medical<br>equipment um pharmaceuticals business<br>service and<br>fuel so because we looked at the total<br>emissions<br>chain for the nhs and the health and<br>social care system<br>it really put into focus what our<br>biggest problems were<br>and it really means that when you look<br>at developing a trajectory developing<br>the emissions plan you really want to<br>focus on the big problems<br>we also wanted to um really focus on the<br>disproportionate problems as well<br>so um mdi usage that's uh meteor dose<br>inhalers who have a high global warming<br>propellant in them<br>so they only treat two conditions um and<br>they're responsible for over three<br>percent of emissions<br>so we really realized that that was a<br>very disproportionate thing that we<br>needed to tackle so we wanted to focus<br>on that<br>it's the same with anaesthetic gases so<br>they're only used in surgical procedures<br>pretty much<br>um and they were nearly two percent of<br>the carbon footprint so another major<br>disproportional problem<br>and i think one of the things that i've<br>noticed since being in new zealand i<br>think there's something like a thousand<br>registers and ether tests in new zealand<br>so in terms of really getting<br>to the source of the problem and really<br>engaging the right people to drive what<br>might be<br>quite a significant proportion of new<br>zealand's emissions in the health sector<br>actually it's i say relatively simple to<br>engage<br>a small number of people in terms of a<br>thousand people rather than trying to<br>influence the millions of nurses that<br>drive<br>other decisions um across the board so<br>it's a really useful one just to<br>remember what other disproportionate<br>problems<br>and the other really useful piece of<br>context is<br>in the uk but also in new zealand um<br>both governments are leaning on<br>decarbonizing their grid electricity<br>so it's um it helps you see the context<br>of what's going on around you<br>and it means you can leverage that<br>context to maybe move more of the fuels<br>carbon footprint into electricity space<br>it also means that if someone else is<br>taking responsibility for a certain<br>area of emissions reduction um it just<br>helps us refocus on the areas that we<br>need to double down on<br>which is really important not to<br>so that was the experience in the nhs<br>and i just want to kind of bring this<br>back to<br>the new zealand context so<br>um i'm sure you're all aware of all of<br>these so i won't go into detail but it's<br>just really useful to remember that<br>there's lots of things happening in the<br>space in a very short period of time<br>which is<br>awesome and it really means that the<br>health sector can leverage a lot of this<br>for change<br>so you all know about the zero carbon<br>acts and the targets and the budgets<br>that are going to be set we all know<br>about climate change commission<br>there was a restatement of new zealand<br>to get 200 renewable grid by 2035.<br>we know that the policy around the<br>emissions trading scheme is is starting<br>to roll out even more and there's<br>potentially reforms to include climate<br>change<br>in the rma as well and we're potentially<br>seeing<br>guidance from mfe and other agencies<br>across new zealand that says defeat<br>transition to evie is going to be a<br>really important part<br>of new zealand's decarbonisation so all<br>of this great stuff's happening it's<br>just about leveraging that change within<br>the health sector<br>so this is an example um that's not<br>health sector but it gives you an<br>example of the process we need to go<br>through as an organization to develop<br>a zero emissions trajectory<br>so um this is utilities company so<br>they've got both<br>um emissions in terms<br>of um normal greenhouse gases but also<br>biogenic methane so that's why<br>their target isn't to fully to net zero<br>because under the zero carbon x there's<br>a different target for biogenic methane<br>by 2050.<br>so it's important to understand what of<br>your emissions are included in the zero<br>carbon act for context and what isn't<br>but also the other thing we worked with<br>this organization was to understand<br>what population growth might do for<br>driving their emissions<br>so this solid black line is to represent<br>a potential<br>uh bau scenario business usual scenario<br>for emissions over time<br>so when you start to see the fact that<br>it's going to grow over time really<br>emphasizes the need to challenge<br>and think about that now i think it's<br>the same in the health sector we<br>know that population growth is probably<br>going to be an issue for dhbs in terms<br>of treatment but we also know the types<br>of cases<br>and the acuity of disease that we're<br>going to see over the next 30 years in<br>most<br>developed nations is also going to get<br>more and more complex and therefore<br>we're going to need to provide<br>support for people who live longer and<br>longer into their lives<br>so what we did after understanding the<br>bau was start trying to think about what<br>the opportunities to reduce<br>against this bae profile so the<br>utilities company i'm talking about here<br>they<br>already had planned a demand management<br>program so we worked with them to<br>understand how effective that was going<br>to be<br>this was a really early program in their<br>kind of um broad spectrum of their<br>sustainability plan<br>but it was really useful for them to<br>start seeing the impact of that over<br>time<br>and it is only a small impact but it was<br>definitely a start and they know they<br>can do more into my management so it<br>really helped visualize that that<br>program was awesome but um<br>it needed a lot more support<br>then we looked at some of the new<br>zealand context and<br>as already mentioned we know new<br>zealand's got a target to be 100<br>renewable electric electricity by 2035.<br>so we looked at three different<br>scenarios over time<br>um appreciate that target is set by<br>government but governments change in<br>context change<br>so we looked at if we were going to<br>slowly move to more and more<br>uh renewable grid these are three<br>different scenarios so the sum of them<br>means that<br>their grid is 100 renewable so it's<br>moving that context into your<br>operational understanding which is<br>really<br>important then we also wanted to look at<br>if<br>the company moved a lot of their fleet<br>to ev<br>is some of the key contexts they could<br>do corporately what would that also<br>contribute to their emissions<br>so you can see through these kind of um<br>some of the contexts and the stuff they<br>could drive they're starting to reduce<br>this bau profile which is awesome but<br>it's still not reducing it below where<br>they are now<br>so there's a real useful reminder to the<br>organization that actually they need to<br>go faster and further<br>and just to show three different<br>scenarios so the baseline is this is the<br>assessment we did in 2017<br>this is the um bits that make up the<br>2050 bau profile and this is the<br>impact of the different wedges the<br>important thing to see this purple box<br>is electricity<br>so under bau if the grid doesn't<br>decarbonize<br>and there's massive growth in their<br>population this purple box only becomes<br>well remains the second biggest problem<br>for the organization<br>however under the context of getting to<br>100 renewable grid it actually becomes<br>the<br>i think it's the seventh or eighth<br>biggest problem so it's really useful to<br>remind the organization that don't start<br>on the context of today<br>work back from what 2050 might look like<br>because it really reframes what the<br>problems are<br>and it really shows that efficiency is<br>going to get part of the way but<br>actually if we work back from 2050 we<br>can start looking at what transformation<br>is going to be required<br>at an organizational level which applies<br>just as much to health as to anyone else<br>so um what we started doing is we're<br>looking at um further technical<br>solutions working back from 2050 to<br>build<br>numerous wedges to um offer additional<br>carbon savings over time<br>and then the final bit of the the work<br>that we're going to be doing is looking<br>at a carbon offset strategy<br>so really trying to put this at the very<br>last um aspect<br>of their um priority so really trying to<br>work on reduction before offsetting<br>but knowing offsetting is probably going<br>to be part of the solution<br>so if that's buying carbon credits or<br>exploring<br>and future technologies around carbon<br>what would be really great to do with<br>this organization as well is<br>some of this bae profile includes some<br>script 3 emissions but it doesn't<br>include all skip 3 emissions<br>so what we're really trying to do now is<br>with this organization to understand<br>the um all the other emissions because<br>the vast majority of this<br>under the black line at the minute is is<br>energy<br>it's gas it's process emissions but<br>actually it's not including the entirety<br>of their supply chain<br>so we're really trying to encourage them<br>to think about not just the things they<br>control but the elements they really<br>should be influencing<br>and appreciating the zero carbon act<br>just looks at goods and services that<br>are generated within the new zealand<br>um country boundary but actually if you<br>really want to think about an<br>organization's footprint you need to<br>think much more broader about the things<br>that it consumes<br>and like a dhb like this organization<br>buys a lot of<br>goods and services from um different<br>nations<br>appreciating them under their um<br>international agreements all countries<br>should be pulling their weight in terms<br>of reducing emissions<br>but i think the health sector because<br>it's got quite a<br>narrow supply chain on some of the<br>bigger more um intensive<br>um aspects and products you use on a<br>daily basis actually<br>there should be some really good levers<br>across health to engage with some of<br>those<br>bigger global suppliers<br>um so lessons learned from the process<br>of what we've been doing<br>um at sdu and in new zealand<br>i think it's really good to make the<br>point that on your first cut of<br>trying to develop a trajectory like this<br>you're probably not going to get to net<br>zero<br>but i think that's okay i think we need<br>to start the conversation start the<br>journey to really<br>understand how much more work is needed<br>so i think it's about being brave and<br>going for it anyways<br>um i think it's really important to be<br>clear about what scope you want to<br>include in trajectory and what you don't<br>i think that's an organization by<br>but i would implore you to be as<br>ambitious and pros as possible<br>and include as much as your scope three<br>so for healthcare i really think it's<br>important to look at patient and visit a<br>travel<br>i think it's really important to think<br>about staff travel and<br>um from the nhs experience 60 to 70 of<br>our emissions for purchase goods and<br>services so it's really important to try<br>and tackle that problem as well<br>i think one of the key aspects that we<br>learned at nhs and we're still<br>continuing to to work on<br>is talking to everyone and there's lots<br>of people out there that have lots of<br>really useful information that can bring<br>new solutions to the table<br>so talk to internal and external<br>stakeholders it's about brainstorming<br>lots of ideas<br>and then sending the levers you have and<br>a lot of those is the contractual levers<br>that you might have as an organization<br>so thinking about how procurement can<br>play a really important role<br>in driving your um net zero carbon<br>outcome<br>i think it's really great to get runs on<br>the board and i've seen all the dhbs are<br>you know really progressing on the<br>carbon agendas i think it's<br>awesome the amount of progress you've<br>made um<br>i think my note of caution is to not<br>sweat the small stuff too much<br>and start trying to think about what<br>longer medium to longer term<br>transformation might mean for um<br>dhbs and the health sector in new<br>zealand so thinking about things like<br>how do we<br>get more and more aligned to prime<br>prevention<br>looking at different more new and<br>sustainable care models<br>and i say please don't sweat the small<br>stuff have a look at your<br>green ass class infantry and focus on<br>the big problems don't focus on the<br>smaller ones<br>so that's my lessons learned and i<br>thought i'd finish off quickly with some<br>things about what can i do it's always a<br>good question to end on<br>so i thought i'd give three or four<br>points about what a clinician or<br>frontline member of staff could do and<br>also what some of the decision makers<br>could do<br>so um i have the privilege of being<br>married to an icu nurse so i learned a<br>lot about the day-to-day operations of a<br>hospital<br>um and i think one things that she's<br>definitely taught me is<br>she's really good now asking yourselves<br>well do i need to use this<br>is the clinical policy saying i need to<br>use this for the right reasons<br>and challenging some of those decisions<br>on a day-to-day basis because you think<br>the number of nurses in new zealand that<br>have to make millions of decisions on a<br>daily basis about using gloves using<br>gowns etc<br>i appreciate covid has definitely forced<br>us to absolutely prioritize infection<br>control i'm definitely not saying we<br>shouldn't<br>um but there's lots of decisions that<br>can be made on a daily basis<br>and i think especially in the clinical<br>space especially if you're involved in<br>uh prescription of mdis or use of um<br>some of the more intensive<br>um anaesthetics is really asking<br>yourself the question do you need to use<br>those<br>and for decision makers um i really<br>stress the importance of undertaking a<br>procurement baseline it's being brave to<br>understand the whole size of the problem<br>which i appreciate is scary but i think<br>it's really important<br>um open up the discussion about<br>transformation i think that's really key<br>really assessing our business model of<br>our um<br>healthcare institution within new<br>zealand and really trying to come up<br>with ways<br>to make people happier healthier<br>communities more resilient<br>actually their ultimate goal would be<br>downsizing the size of the health sector<br>in the first place because<br>a lot of the time we just treat illness<br>and actually wouldn't it be great if we<br>were all really fixed on keeping people<br>out possible in the first place<br>and i know you all know this and i know<br>you all want that future as well so<br>definitely not teaching you anything new<br>on that one but it's always good to<br>remind ourselves<br>and i think focusing on the biggest<br>issues and working back from 2050 is<br>really important<br>and also making the most and leveraging<br>the change you're going to see at<br>government and national level i think<br>it's really important too<br>cool so that is a 20 minute whistle stop<br>tour<br>through some of the stuff i'm doing at<br>the sdu before i came to new zealand and<br>some exciting work you've been doing<br>at new zealand so really happy to kind<br>you alright that was sensational<br>some really key learnings and valuable<br>insights there<br>thank you so much for sharing those um<br>we do have some questions<br>um yes we're gonna a person's ask for a<br>copy of your slides so we'll make sure<br>that they get shared on the<br>otago uni website um one the first<br>question is what is demand management<br>please<br>yeah sure so in the context of the<br>um utilities company it was actually<br>managing the need for their services<br>so um without actually saying the name<br>of the university company who still<br>haven't shared all that information with<br>their stakeholders yet<br>i think the easiest way to explain it<br>and translate it to health<br>is is about trying to prevent people<br>from needing to even come through the<br>door of a hospital<br>so it's for those guys it's about<br>reducing the<br>need for and the output of their service<br>um much is the same as we would do as we<br>thought about prevention<br>for a healthcare organization<br>very good easier said than done hey but<br>yeah with some strong<br>population health strategies<br>that would help tackling obesity for<br>example but yeah great<br>great answer um what another questions<br>come through could you just explain a<br>little bit more about what scope three<br>involves and includes please yeah sure<br>so if<br>we focus on health because it's probably<br>a bit easier to explain so<br>the definition of scope three is<br>indirect emissions that<br>usually uh downstream so if we think<br>about a<br>hospital or a dhb is going to be using<br>thousands of catheters<br>thousands of gowns and hats all of those<br>products and services will have been<br>manufactured created<br>either in new zealand or another country<br>so scope 3 is all the emissions<br>associated with the extraction<br>processing transport and treatment of<br>all those raw materials<br>that make up the goods that we use on a<br>day-to-day basis<br>um the other aspect of scope three is<br>around like purchasing<br>um air travel so flights but also<br>um transport that isn't owned by a dhb<br>so that would be staff getting to work<br>and i'll be patient and visitors<br>accessing the hospitals and the dhbs<br>so we found and trying to remember the<br>numbers off the top of my head<br>i think staff commuting and patient<br>visit travel were two of the larger<br>parts of the nhs footprint i think<br>overall they added up to something like<br>10 12<br>so it's really important for dhbs to<br>tackle<br>when and why people need to travel to<br>the hospital<br>so if you think about how you arrange<br>appointments using telehealth<br>getting patients to connect with the gp<br>in primary care and using that to<br>leverage connection with the dhbs to try<br>and reduce their travel and then it's<br>about if they do need to get to site how<br>do we reduce<br>their carbon intensity of the way they<br>get there<br>so using public transport et cetera<br>yeah thank you for that it shows you how<br>massive um an impact scope three<br>emissions do have<br>on them on all large organizations um<br>dhb included and it's actually really<br>tricky to measure the full impact of<br>your scope 3<br>and we have been trying over the number<br>of years as a sustainable health sector<br>national network and sustainability<br>managers to do that so<br>and one of the questions came in<br>actually where would we actually start<br>in new zealand to be able to incorporate<br>procurement emissions in the dhb<br>footprint<br>because it's very hard yep it it's not<br>easy<br>um becca we've been tracking our<br>procurement emissions for the last<br>two years now i think and it's like 18<br>well it's 90<br>of our problem so for us it's even<br>greater because we don't have the same<br>amount of estate as a dhb<br>and we're about to start work with adhd<br>as well to do the the carbon footprint<br>of their procurement which would be<br>awesome<br>and essentially and just to simplify the<br>process what we do is we<br>um use a lot of the financial spend data<br>from an organization whether it's the<br>dhb or becker<br>and there's um several international<br>databases that say for every dollar<br>spent from<br>a product that's made in a certain<br>country a certain part of the world<br>there's a certain carbon intensity<br>so the mass is quite simple it's a times<br>b the difficulty<br>is lining up the categories of how you<br>um organize your spending organization<br>and choosing the right database and<br>using the right factor<br>so um we use one database within the nhs<br>um which is really useful there was a<br>global um report done by healthcare.harm<br>and they use a slightly different<br>database<br>and the work we do in becker and i'm<br>going to use with adhb is a new zealand<br>specific database<br>so um the art and science of carbon<br>footprinting<br>is relatively simple in terms of the<br>calculation the difficulty<br>is is making sure you make the right<br>thank you thank you so much i'm just<br>wondering<br>um you know should a dhb be setting a<br>goal<br>of achieving um net zero carbon<br>how achievable is that so against the<br>whole<br>um all emissions yeah okay uh<br>it's it's a difficult one the way we<br>kind of negotiated at the nhs was<br>um really setting ourselves to be really<br>aspirational to really set a<br>global mandate that we should be trying<br>to get everything to net zero<br>and appreciate right now we do not have<br>the technology we do not have the road<br>map or the solutions to get to net zero<br>yet<br>but if we don't aim for it we're never<br>gonna get there<br>so i'm always the type of person i'd<br>rather aim for the stars and just about<br>make it to the moon than only aim to get<br>up the hill and definitely get there<br>so it's about talking to your<br>organization about how<br>willing they are to be really kind of<br>ambitious and aspirational<br>or do they really want to set a target<br>they know they can achieve and my<br>personal view is<br>collectively if we all aim for the stars<br>and we don't quite get there we'll have<br>got somewhere really fantastic<br>so that's still really important and i<br>think that's the type of conversation we<br>should be having with dhb leaders<br>to say hey if we collectively all set<br>that mandate that we really want to get<br>here<br>actually that's really going to help the<br>whole system shift<br>um rather than not being aspirational<br>enough and seeing the downstream<br>problems of not talking to climate<br>change enough<br>with more people coming through the<br>front door because we haven't held our<br>own<br>kind of system level um approach<br>in enough regard and therefore the<br>biggest bill payer and a lot of<br>the downstream impacts of climate change<br>is going to be local government and<br>health so<br>if we don't tackle the problem we're<br>going to be part of the problem as well<br>well said well said totally agree hey<br>we've got<br>time for one more question and there's<br>been quite a few actually<br>so um i will mention how you can get<br>your questions answered if we haven't<br>managed to answer your question today<br>this is gonna this question links in the<br>webinar in two weeks time because it's<br>about food<br>so what are your thoughts on getting<br>more hospitals using less meat<br>and dairy on patients menus and<br>hospitals cafes<br>yeah i think that's awesome it's it's<br>about finding the win win wins and i<br>think<br>moving to a vegetarian diet you spend<br>less money because meat is actually<br>quite expensive<br>it's actually quite high carbon and<br>excess of red meat is actually really<br>unhealthy<br>so to me it's an absolute no-brainer one<br>of the things we found from the nhs is<br>actually the carbon footprint of food<br>wasn't<br>huge but the water footprint of our food<br>was the highest<br>by far i think it was nearly 50 of the<br>nhs<br>entire water footprint 50. might not be<br>right i have to check that<br>but it was the largest part and it was<br>uh<br>helped us really understand that if you<br>have several different lenses of carbon<br>air pollution water footprint it really<br>helped you understand<br>the breadth of the problem and once you<br>know the breadth of the problem it can<br>really help you derive the right<br>solutions and focus on the right<br>elements and i can't reiterate my point<br>enough about not sweating the small<br>stuff<br>if something is half a percent of your<br>carbon inventory please don't focus on<br>it focus on the areas that are more<br>difficult<br>fantastic nami<br>kiara that was awesome that was really<br>good<br>thank you rick for a wonderful<br>presentation and thanks to everyone<br>for joining us today please don't forget<br>to tune in<br>in two weeks time which is a webinar<br>which features dr jeff kira<br>from the school of health sciences<br>massey university and the title of<br>jeff's<br>webinar session is health equity and<br>access to food<br>if you have any unanswered questions um<br>please send them to wellington<br>events otago.ac.nz<br>i think the key take-home message from<br>rick is<br>work back from 2050 and develop the<br>plans to allow for the transformation<br>required<br>please remember to get active in this</p></main><footer
