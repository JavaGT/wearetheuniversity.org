is poppy and i am the<br>professional program<br>manager at recruitment and partnerships<br>and what that really means is i'm here<br>to support students<br>with their journey into postgraduate<br>study here at the wellington school of<br>business and government<br>today this webinar is about our support<br>that we have for our students<br>so i've done some previous webinars<br>which talk about our individual programs<br>but we've had some requests to talk<br>about the different side of study<br>because a lot of study is is what goes<br>with it<br>what you can get in support wise<br>academic but also holistic<br>so today i'm going to talk through those<br>options i do have my colleague behind<br>the scenes charlotte deans<br>she'll be asked answering some of your<br>questions so if you do have questions as<br>we go along<br>please join the q a and and we can<br>answer those questions for you and if we<br>have time at the end<br>we will do some more q a as well but<br>we'll get into explaining a little bit<br>about the support that we have here<br>for the professional programs so on my<br>screen you'll see we have a snapshot of<br>who our students are<br>and when we talk about the professional<br>programs here at the wellington school<br>of business and government<br>what we're talking about is is 10<br>postgraduate programs<br>which are all about enhancing or<br>accelerating<br>you professionally you may be a student<br>who's at the very beginning of their<br>career and you're wanting to to move up<br>and<br>i'll kind of kick start it or you might<br>be in at the<br>other end where you're quite senior and<br>you're looking at upskilling<br>um or enhancing that career so those are<br>the programs that we look after here in<br>the professional programs office<br>so we've got a quick snapshot of who our<br>students are<br>so you'll see the top statistic there<br>says that we've got 30<br>international students so we do have a<br>really diverse range of students under<br>our professional program umbrella<br>the second statistic there is the age<br>range<br>so our younger student is 20 and we do<br>go all the way up to 72 years of age<br>so we do have a massive range of<br>students all the way up throughout their<br>different career stages<br>but the last statistic there looks at<br>how people study<br>and what we typically see is people do<br>want to study part-time or typically<br>study part-time while they're doing our<br>professional program<br>so 81 of our students doing part-time<br>study<br>where 19 are doing it full time<br>but what does it mean when you're a<br>postgrad student or in particular being<br>a professional program student<br>and what are some things that you might<br>need to think about before you embark on<br>this journey<br>into your professional program and<br>postgraduate study<br>the first thing is thinking about the<br>time so when we talk about time and time<br>management what that really means is<br>thinking about the time that you're<br>going to be committing to your your<br>classes<br>so when you're going to be physically in<br>class but then also<br>things to do with readings working on<br>assignment if you've got an industry<br>consultancy project where you're<br>actually getting out into the um<br>kind of real world and getting your<br>hands dirty how many hours is that going<br>to mean<br>so when we're looking at our courses if<br>it's a 15-point course or one of our<br>standard courses here<br>you're looking at about 10 to 15 hours<br>of study a week<br>so that's something you do want to<br>consider when you're thinking about your<br>postgraduate study<br>in particular if you're one of those<br>students who's looking at studying<br>part-time<br>alongside a full-time job think about<br>how many hours that you can contribute<br>to your study<br>now it may seem like a lot if you're<br>working a 40-hour week and then adding<br>10 or even<br>20 hours on top of that and i'm going to<br>talk through some tips or some<br>services that are there to help you<br>juggling what what you have with your<br>study<br>the next icon there i do have juggling<br>and and that's something our students<br>often say<br>they're usually having to struggle a lot<br>and this juggling can mean many things<br>you like i've mentioned you might be<br>juggling working full-time<br>you might be juggling a part-time job<br>with full-time study or part-time in<br>both<br>you might have kids you might have other<br>commitments your own business<br>all of these things can can make your<br>study a little bit more difficult<br>and so we want to make sure you know<br>about all the support services that are<br>there to support you then there are<br>things that you might be thinking about<br>what you're wanting to get out of your<br>study what networks that you're going to<br>be building<br>the people you're going to be meeting in<br>your class for friendship but then also<br>the<br>the professional networks that you can<br>use as you move throughout your career<br>and then we also want you to think about<br>when you're juggling all of these things<br>and<br>and all these reasons and motivations<br>you have towards your study<br>what is going to take up a lot of mental<br>capacity what are you having to think<br>about<br>what stresses you that you might have so<br>yes you might be adding it on to a<br>full-time job<br>but what is that job do you have a lot<br>of deadlines and a lot of<br>things that are really demanding your<br>attention and how can we pair that<br>nicely with your study<br>and then thinking as well about finances<br>and how you're going to fund your study<br>but also how you're going to support<br>yourself while if you do give up work or<br>take reduced hours<br>how are you going to support yourself<br>while you're studying and lastly<br>thinking about when was the last time<br>you've studied have you studied<br>so in the professional programs we do<br>accept students who don't<br>necessarily have a bachelor's degree but<br>have a wealth of<br>extensive or professional background<br>behind them to to help them with their<br>study<br>so sometimes students can feel quite<br>nervous that they might not have that<br>traditional or for formal educational<br>training<br>and and so we want to share with you the<br>support services who are there who are<br>going to help you<br>with your academics so these are the<br>things i am going to cover this evening<br>we have about 40 minutes it's quite a<br>lot of content to cover in that time<br>so if you do have questions while we're<br>having a chat<br>please definitely send them through uh<br>through the q a function<br>and like i mentioned if we do get time i<br>will answer them at the end<br>but everything i'm talking about today<br>is found on the victoria university of<br>wellington website<br>and you can find more detail about all<br>these support services<br>how you can book in how you can engage<br>with them and find out more information<br>so<br>if i don't cover specifically what<br>you're after please have a look on our<br>website<br>but the first one i'm going to talk<br>about is our support services the<br>academic side<br>so how students can extend their<br>learning how you can make sure you're<br>academically prepared for your study<br>so the first one here is student<br>learning and this team<br>is an amazing team we have at the<br>university and we're really really lucky<br>to have them<br>because they do help with the academic<br>side they help with your<br>your study they run workshops and exam<br>technique or<br>um how to take notes or how to speed<br>read all of those kinds of things<br>but they do also help with the holistic<br>side as well so they can help with the<br>time management<br>so when i mentioned before you might<br>have 10 to 15 hours of study per week<br>they can help you look at a timetable<br>and say right you're going to drop your<br>kids off here<br>then you've got an hour to yourself that<br>you can study then you've got class then<br>you've got work<br>so they can really help you piece that<br>all together<br>to make sure the study works for you<br>they do<br>help our undergraduate students but they<br>also have a lot of amazing<br>amazing services for our postgraduate<br>students and<br>i've got some of the workshops on the<br>screen there that they run but they<br>cover things like academic<br>speaking academic writing critical<br>thinking all those really important<br>skills that you will need for your<br>postgraduate study<br>the next one to support our students is<br>our disability services<br>and these are another a really amazing<br>team and they're a very busy team they<br>support lots of students here at the<br>university<br>and they're here to support you whether<br>your disability is ongoing<br>or whether it's a short-term disability<br>or something that you need a little bit<br>of extra help with<br>so they help with physical impairments<br>they also help with mental health<br>if you need support like note taking or<br>access suites<br>which are quiet areas that you can do<br>your study all of these things are<br>available to be arranged for you<br>what happens is you get a connected with<br>a disability and inclusion advisor<br>and they work with our students<br>one-on-one and support them<br>and help them make out a plan to make<br>sure that they can get the most out of<br>their study<br>the next uh very important area we have<br>is our<br>libraries so we do have four libraries<br>at the university<br>uh but here at the business school we<br>have one of our libraries which is in<br>the top picture there<br>and this is really important for our<br>postgraduate students<br>sometimes accessing a library can feel<br>quite daunting<br>there are lots of um things that can<br>feel a bit hard to find or<br>there's lots of databases and things<br>like that so we do have subject<br>librarians the lovely tom you can see on<br>the screen<br>he can help you uh find out what you're<br>looking for<br>you can not only just find your books<br>and your research papers and things like<br>that to help you with your study<br>but they also have things like past exam<br>papers<br>so if you're doing a course that does<br>have an exam you can actually go through<br>and see what previous students have been<br>assessed on<br>to give you a little bit more of a<br>picture of what might be coming up in in<br>your future study<br>they also help with referencing support<br>and i should have mentioned as well<br>student learning help with with this<br>and but this is an area that a lot of<br>postgraduate students feel a little bit<br>scared about or<br>a little bit uncertain about especially<br>if you've had a wee gap between your<br>your undergraduate study or you're<br>coming in and this is your first time at<br>the university<br>so any of these terms or jargon that you<br>do associate with postgraduate study<br>and you may fail a little uneasy about<br>we do have people here to help you with<br>another area that i tend to get asked<br>quite a lot about is our language<br>learning center<br>now this is a service that you don't<br>have to use it's not something that<br>people regularly stumble across but it<br>is a service if you're interested in<br>learning another language<br>whether that's to accompany your study<br>or maybe english is your second language<br>and you're wanting to<br>build your skills up more in that area<br>the language learning center is a really<br>good resource to connect with<br>and they have lots of free resources<br>that you can use to to learn<br>um over 80 different languages they also<br>have a system called the language buddy<br>and this is where you get paired with<br>another student and you can help each<br>other<br>learn your language and and work<br>together so it's a really nice way to<br>to network to connect with people but<br>we now i'm kind of verging on a little<br>bit of the holistic side of support<br>as well as the academic support here but<br>the next two<br>cards i'm going to talk to are athena<br>and our pacific<br>pacifica support um programs so our fina<br>is our ong for on-campus whanau for our<br>maori students<br>and it's all about academics success and<br>providing a safe and culturally safe<br>space for students to learn<br>and grow during their studies they<br>provide one-on-one mentoring they also<br>provide group<br>workshops and tutorials and it's a<br>really nice space to connect with your<br>other students<br>similarly the pacifica success team uh<br>they they provide<br>mentoring as well for our pacifica sorry<br>pacifica students<br>and they also have pacifica house which<br>is an area that students can go and<br>study in<br>and they provide the holistic side of<br>now i'm going to touch a little bit more<br>on the holistic side of the support and<br>i know i did just talk a little bit<br>about them<br>um but here are some things that you<br>might not necessarily be thinking about<br>when you're thinking about support at<br>the university<br>so often we talk about the academic side<br>and and what you can do to excel<br>by making sure that you're getting<br>prepped with your academic reading and<br>your writing<br>but we really want to make sure that<br>you're you're healthy and you're well<br>and you're getting supported in more<br>ways than just your academic<br>so the first service here that i'm going<br>to talk to are our student associations<br>so when you enroll you get asked if you<br>want to join view so the top one there<br>so it's a good idea to know a little bit<br>about it<br>is at the university's student<br>association<br>and what that means is there's student<br>representative there are student voice<br>they're run by students they get voted<br>in every year<br>and they host orientation events they<br>look after you they do student advocacy<br>then they also<br>organize some more of the pastoral care<br>stuff so<br>they have a community pantry or they can<br>help you get discounted<br>uh public transport we also though<br>for you students as we have our<br>postgraduate student association<br>which is pgsa and this is a little bit<br>more targeted for our postgraduate<br>students<br>so it is also student-led and so our<br>postgraduate students run it they run<br>events they run networking<br>their student advocacy as well student<br>representation<br>so there are two really good<br>organizations to get to know<br>you can see how you can get involved<br>yourself but also see how they can help<br>you<br>we also are really strong on our<br>diversity and inclusion and we<br>really want to make victoria university<br>of wellington a place for any student<br>and any student that feels<br>so can feel that they belong there so<br>the university itself has 22 000<br>students<br>and like i mentioned our professional<br>program students are very diverse<br>the university group is very diverse as<br>well<br>so when we're looking at it we have a<br>wider age in<br>the whole university of younger 16 and<br>and a lot older as well<br>we have a hundred plus students sorry of<br>students from 100 plus different<br>countries<br>and what that means is we do have a<br>really amazing student culture here<br>and to embrace that we have a variety of<br>services and networks and committees<br>to promote diversity and inclusion and<br>to support our students<br>who to feel welcome but also get the<br>support that they may need so we have<br>certain networks<br>for example we have a refugee background<br>student network<br>we have rainbow student network so if<br>you are interested in finding out more<br>about the networks and the communities<br>that you can join here at the university<br>i encourage you to go onto the website<br>now when we're looking at your study and<br>i did talk about it right at the<br>beginning<br>sometimes we have to factor in money the<br>cost of study<br>but also the cost of of what it's going<br>to be like while you're studying and how<br>you can support yourself<br>now we have the student finance team and<br>and in the student finance team we have<br>the student finance advisors<br>they are they're there to provide<br>confidential<br>advice to students who might be uh<br>either they're going through a hard time<br>and they need that help to get them out<br>of there<br>or also actually to prevent you from<br>getting to that hard time<br>they can help you with budgeting advice<br>study link advice<br>and we have the hardship grant that i<br>was talking about if you<br>you struggle and you do need an uh cash<br>injection they can help with that<br>but they do want to make sure that you<br>are you're well financially and they<br>have lots of things in place to make<br>sure<br>that they can set you up well so if you<br>are interested in the cost of study and<br>how you can support yourself<br>on our website we have two publications<br>called the financial survival guide<br>for domestic students and the financial<br>survival guide for<br>international students that book is full<br>of really important information and<br>really useful information<br>it's a good way of your prospective<br>student and you're thinking about<br>starting studied<br>have a look and then you can start<br>we also get asked a fair bit about child<br>care and and that is because<br>our professional program students are<br>very diverse and<br>they do tend to have um sometimes they<br>have children and other things<br>so we do like to talk about our<br>childcare options but also i don't have<br>on the slide there<br>there are areas if you need to change<br>your child or breastfeed your child<br>we do have spaces on campus but what i<br>have on the screen<br>is our victoria kids so that's our child<br>care facility<br>now there are two locations for victoria<br>kids and they're up close to our kelvin<br>campus<br>which is our main campus of the<br>university it's about a 20 minute walk<br>away from the the business school where<br>i'm at today<br>victoria kids can look after children<br>for for staff members but also students<br>at the university<br>and they do work with students if you've<br>got a work and income subsidy or study<br>link subsidy<br>that can count towards the child care<br>here at the university<br>so do look into it if you if you are<br>considering um<br>that now wellington university<br>international<br>if you are an international student i'm<br>sure you you know of this amazing team<br>or have connected with them already<br>they're here on campus to support<br>students uh international students from<br>the moment you've started to think about<br>study<br>all the way through to graduation they<br>can help you thinking<br>initially about what courses you're<br>interested in doing and<br>so programs any visa issues that you<br>might have or just getting your visa<br>sorted<br>they can help you with enrolling<br>re-enrolling so they are a fantastic<br>team and they've got a wealth of<br>knowledge to be able to help you<br>so if you are going to be applying to<br>the university as an international<br>student<br>they're a really good first point of<br>call to connect with<br>and they'll be able to help you navigate<br>the enrollment system and the<br>application<br>journey and then this here the<br>professional programs<br>office this is my team so similarly to<br>the international team we are here to<br>help you from the very beginning of your<br>journey<br>so as soon as you start thinking about<br>professional program study or<br>postgraduate study<br>might be for you that's when you can get<br>in touch with us<br>we can help you work out what courses<br>might best suit you<br>and same with the programs we can help<br>you with enrollment<br>but then also when you're a student here<br>we help you with your orientation<br>so all of the support services that i've<br>i very quickly<br>talked about and i'm talking about<br>tonight this is where we can actually<br>help you connect a little bit more<br>show you around the university and make<br>sure that you're properly set up to get<br>the most out of your study<br>we also that the image on the screen we<br>is a<br>sorry dedicated student study space so<br>for our professional program<br>students we do have a specific uh space<br>for you to use<br>and this is quite nice because if you<br>were juggling lots of things like your<br>work and your child care and all of<br>those things i've mentioned before<br>it can sometimes feel a bit hard to find<br>time for you<br>and find time for your study so there's<br>a space that you can access<br>here at the business school there is a<br>computer suite there's a kitchenette<br>there's um quite study areas bookable<br>study rooms if you want to study with<br>other students<br>and it's a really nice place also to<br>network with your fellow<br>professional program students so if you<br>are going to study with us and if you're<br>in wellington<br>please come and check it out we can show<br>the space to you because it's really<br>nice to know<br>that that is the space for you and you<br>can defend some time<br>so the next category i'm going to talk<br>about other services to keep you well<br>and that's well in terms of your<br>physical health but also your mental<br>health and well-being<br>so the first i'm going to talk about is<br>maori aura<br>so maori aura is our student health and<br>counseling here at the university<br>so when i talk about the university and<br>the campuses<br>we we do have different campuses for<br>different um<br>areas or subject areas so when i talk<br>about the pipetea campus or<br>or the business school that's the<br>specific area that most of our<br>professional programs are taught out of<br>so maori ora student health they do have<br>a doctors and counselling here<br>at the business school but also one up<br>at kelvin as well<br>and they're here to make sure they can<br>help you with any of your<br>primary health concerns but then they<br>also do have specific<br>clinical specialists coming in so<br>they're a really good point first point<br>of call<br>and if you are a domestic student for<br>those general uh queries that you might<br>have or general appointments<br>they are free to use if you register<br>with them<br>they can help when you get sick during<br>the trimester<br>but they're also there at the general<br>crunch times<br>so we do tend to find our students can<br>get a little bit stressed or overwhelmed<br>when you have a lot on and<br>and typically that's around exam time so<br>they<br>are able to support students there they<br>do have extra staff on<br>in case you need to talk to them and<br>they can help you<br>in work with your academics and make<br>sure that whatever it might be that's<br>affecting you<br>doesn't affect your your academic<br>results<br>so part of the maori aura team as well<br>though is we have student counselling<br>and student counselling are a team to<br>help you with with your mental health<br>and well-being<br>and they provide counselling<br>appointments for our students<br>we really encourage you to access<br>student counseling if you do need to<br>talk to someone<br>and it works in a similar way as i was<br>talking before about the finances<br>they like you to engage early on to make<br>sure that they're there to give you good<br>behaviors and good skills<br>to make sure you're not having a bad<br>period<br>and like i mentioned before with the<br>student health<br>the sessions are free for domestic<br>students and also anza<br>but so those are our one-on-one<br>appointments typically so they run from<br>maori aura<br>then we have more workshop styles and<br>these are run by maori aura but we also<br>have<br>um a student well-being awareness team<br>the university recreation center um<br>also runs workshops so there are lots of<br>different workshops or online support<br>for our students to to help prepare you<br>or make<br>sure you are um doing well and and<br>being able to prevent bad things from<br>happening<br>so the student well-being team they run<br>one-off workshops or they have ongoing<br>workshops uh which are run by experience<br>facilitators<br>and they can really help you develop<br>really good skills to help with stress<br>and and<br>helping you with your sleep and anxiety<br>and things like that<br>so those are the one-on-one workshops or<br>the group workshops<br>but there are also online modules which<br>do get changed regularly<br>that you can engage with and really<br>and the final one here in the the stay<br>well category is our university<br>recreation team<br>so the university recreation they look<br>after<br>our fitness centres so our gyms they<br>also look after all of the clubs that we<br>have on campus here<br>so we do have over 140 different clubs<br>these clubs range from um being academic<br>clubs so things that will help you with<br>your study<br>we have cultural clubs language clubs<br>and<br>we have purely social clubs which is<br>just a chance to get to meet people<br>so do definitely explore this side of<br>your study<br>i'm sure you'll be very busy while<br>you're studying but it is a nice way to<br>really connect with the wider university<br>environment<br>and meet like-minded people who might be<br>outside of your classes<br>so you can develop that really strong<br>network<br>at the fitness center though they have<br>the the studio and the weights rooms<br>but they also run um classes<br>so they have over 50 classes a week that<br>students can<br>can join so they're things like zumba or<br>um<br>hit things like that so there if you are<br>interested<br>definitely have a look on their website<br>they've got lots more information<br>and you can find out how you can join<br>and the final thing we have here is is<br>looking at how to<br>enhance your career and the support<br>services or the things that might<br>accompany that<br>now this is one we do get asked a fair<br>bit about being the professional<br>programs<br>so we are professionally focused<br>programs so how can you make sure that<br>the content you're studying how can then<br>you apply it<br>and to help you whether that's get a new<br>job or to enhance your current one<br>so the first one here is our careers and<br>employment team<br>so you will get to know the careers and<br>employment team quite well while you're<br>studying<br>but they also are an amazing resource to<br>to reach out and connect with<br>they help students recognize the skills<br>that they're developing throughout their<br>study<br>they can help you by looking at your cv<br>and checking that you're actually saying<br>that<br>putting the right things in there you're<br>talking about your skills and the right<br>way<br>to to help you when you're getting a job<br>they can also help you build your<br>networking skills<br>so when i talk about networking with<br>your fellow peers<br>and really connecting with them they can<br>help support it to make sure when you go<br>out to networking events<br>you're prepared and you know how to<br>approach those situations<br>they can also help with interviewing<br>when you when you're looking at jobs<br>and this can be interviewing um for<br>students who's<br>sorry second speakers of english might<br>be their second language<br>so it's a really good way to to build<br>those skills and feel really confident<br>when you're going out<br>into the job market they regularly run<br>careers expos as well that they help<br>hold down here at the business school<br>so they run a commerce and law expo<br>where they bring all the employers on<br>campus<br>and you can go around and talk to them<br>see what jobs<br>are out there what skills they're<br>looking for in students<br>so that's a really good way to meet the<br>the employers face to face and have<br>but in your courses you will have some<br>professional development<br>and and so the careers team are there to<br>to provide additional professional<br>development and really help you with<br>that<br>but also to help you explain what<br>professional development you've had<br>during your professional program study<br>so a lot in a lot of our programs<br>they're built in<br>industry connection and that can be done<br>in a variety of different ways<br>that can be through the academics who<br>are teaching you if they have a wealth<br>of knowledge and wealth of experience<br>working in a certain industry<br>they can help with those connections<br>there we might<br>uh for particular programs you might<br>have specific industry connect<br>connection events where you have<br>networking events being held<br>and then we have things like internships<br>or consultancy projects<br>in many of our programs here at the<br>professional programs office<br>where you can get some hands-on<br>experience working<br>in a new zealand company where you get<br>to to really test out the skills and all<br>the stuff that you're learning in class<br>and you can put it into practice then<br>courses that you would take in your<br>program so if you are interested in<br>doing that<br>if you are looking on our website have a<br>look at things which are called<br>consultancy projects<br>or some of the programs do call them<br>internships<br>and finally that we have networking<br>involved in our programs<br>and i feel i've mentioned the word<br>networking a fair bit<br>it is something that our students do a<br>lot they network with the cohort of<br>students that you're studying alongside<br>in your particular programs you network<br>with the wider professional programs<br>offer<br>students so you have a really great<br>network here to draw on<br>but also those events that we hold<br>you'll get to meet<br>other people so other students across<br>the university<br>staff members people well embedded in<br>industries that you might be interested<br>in working in<br>so there's lots of ways that you can<br>connect<br>and really get to develop those skills<br>and and get to meet more people and help<br>so those are that's a very brief summary<br>and<br>of the support services we do have at<br>the university<br>i did warn you at the beginning i was<br>going to talk very fast we did have a<br>lot to go<br>through and like i said you can find out<br>more about all of those services on the<br>website<br>i will open it up though if you do have<br>questions i know quite a lot of you have<br>been sending questions through while<br>i've been talking<br>but if you do have some more questions<br>please send them through to us<br>and we can answer them on air or you're<br>welcome to<br>have a look on our website and find out<br>more information about all of the<br>services that i have mentioned<br>and if you do have any more questions or<br>any questions<br>either ask them here today or definitely<br>get in touch with our team<br>so what we'll do is we'll close off the<br>formal part of the webinar<br>if you've had your questions answered<br>you're welcome to leave<br>but for those of you who want to stick<br>around and ask some more questions<br>so we've uh so we've got a question here<br>which is looking<br>um at joining some of our programs for<br>trimester three<br>and so that's a really good question so<br>it depends on how<br>um whether you're applying as a domestic<br>student or an international student<br>if you're applying as a domestic student<br>then you can go onto our website right<br>now and apply for those programs<br>if you are um looking at applying for an<br>international student as i<br>applying as an international student<br>then you can go<br>do that through wellington university<br>international<br>an easy way to contact them i think this<br>person's interested in the mpa<br>so what you can do is go to the mpa page<br>on the website<br>the apply and contact tab that you'll<br>see there<br>and you'll be able to find their contact<br>details and the application form<br>and applications for trimester 3 are<br>open right now<br>for both domestic and international<br>students so if you are interested in<br>applying please do so and you'll find<br>all the information on our website<br>i have a question here about for<br>international students<br>will there be any dorms or apartments<br>that we can rent<br>that's a very good question and i've<br>just realized i didn't really talk about<br>accommodation during this webinar<br>we do have um the accommodation service<br>here at the university<br>and they help students connect with the<br>the halls of residence or the<br>dormitories<br>we have different setups for different<br>students<br>we do have halls of residence which are<br>um more typically focused or or best<br>suited for our undergraduate students<br>so the 17 year olds have come straight<br>out of school and look at going into<br>those<br>and then we have other ones which are<br>best suited for our postgrad students<br>which is more like a flatting situation<br>which is overseen by the university<br>it depends when you're interested in uh<br>starting i'm not sure when you're<br>thinking about um<br>starting study with us but if you are<br>thinking about trimester three<br>so that's our november intake i<br>recommend that you get in touch with the<br>accommodation team now and talk about<br>options<br>if you are looking about applying for<br>next year so that's our february intake<br>um then you can apply<br>online the applications have just opened<br>they opened on the 1st of august<br>and there's an application process that<br>you go through and you say what halls of<br>residence you're interested in applying<br>for<br>and they do indicate what ones are best<br>i've got another question here regarding<br>the application form for international<br>students how can we send that<br>should it be a hard copy um from the<br>website<br>that's a really good question and and<br>what i would say is get in touch with<br>wellington university international<br>i know with some parts of the<br>application process for our<br>international students<br>with covered and the restrictions that<br>have happened<br>they are able to talk you through a<br>little bit more about if there are any<br>changes to the application<br>um process so i'm sorry i can't answer<br>that one<br>right now but i would say talk to<br>wellington university international and<br>application<br>i've got no more questions at the moment<br>don't i will wait if you're<br>we've got a question here<br>so um so a student going through an<br>authorized agent what type of<br>accommodation<br>so i have a look on the website they do<br>uh have lots of different types of<br>accommodation like i mentioned<br>we have there's a halls of residence uh<br>called education house<br>that would be one that i recommend you<br>look into that<br>is a little bit um it's not like a<br>flatting situation that is more of the<br>individual rooms<br>um but it does accept postgraduate<br>students<br>we also have halls of residence um<br>trying to think of the names top my head<br>stafford house<br>and so that might be a good one to have<br>a look at<br>and everton hall so they tend to be more<br>they're still overseen by the university<br>they<br>they are still in a complex but instead<br>of being those individual rooms<br>you do have maybe four to six other<br>flatmates<br>and they work quite well to put you with<br>other students who are<br>and that you would get unwell with so<br>maybe other students who<br>are from a a similar background or a<br>similar age<br>so it's definitely worth having a look<br>at those those three halls so at<br>education house<br>uh we've got a question here about<br>healthcare so<br>can international students access maori<br>or the health services that i mentioned<br>and and definitely you can so and<br>when when you become a fully registered<br>student with us<br>you can start using those services they<br>do have a cost for international<br>students and<br>on the website if you search student<br>health<br>it should bring it up and it will break<br>down the different cost if there's<br>different costs for different<br>appointments<br>it will let you know that the cost there<br>on the website but<br>yes our uh international students are<br>there's a question here about how much<br>is<br>the initial fees payment required and<br>can<br>you do you mind messaging if you're an<br>international student or a domestic<br>international student so this again<br>sorry is a question for our wellington<br>university international<br>they they can work with you uh typically<br>we<br>ask our international student so ask all<br>of our students<br>to pay their fees upfront per trimester<br>so when i mention trimesters that there<br>are teaching blocks throughout the year<br>so we have our trimester one is our<br>february start<br>trimester two is our july intake our<br>july start<br>and trimester three is in november so<br>uh typically students can sign up for<br>all three<br>and and you can pay for all three if you<br>want and but you can also talk to the<br>trimester<br>i will and just quickly mention if those<br>kinds of questions about fees and things<br>like that i'm not an expert<br>in in them so um if you do have specific<br>questions<br>about um specifically about their<br>international fees<br>or um international applications<br>i'm i'm probably not the best person to<br>ask uh but when we send this email out<br>so when we send an email after this we<br>will<br>send the contact details for the<br>wellington university international<br>and they will be able to answer all of<br>those questions if i can answer them<br>so again a question about how much<br>should you have for living costs<br>um so those booklets that i mentioned<br>that there's<br>um survival guide domestic survival<br>guide and international survival guide<br>they are really good resources to look<br>into because they do break<br>it down um how much typical rent is in<br>wellington<br>how much uh you should factor in um<br>groceries so your food cost<br>and what you should think about actually<br>living so if you want to go to the<br>cinema or the movies and things like<br>that so<br>they do break down a really good cost<br>for students<br>obviously it does change for some<br>students you might not like going to the<br>movies<br>and things like that but it does give<br>you a good indication of what it might<br>cost<br>and my colleague has put in the chat um<br>a link to wellington university<br>international so<br>if you are interested in finding out<br>more or contacting them<br>if you have a look in the chat you<br>it looks like this might be all the<br>questions that we<br>we've got this evening um<br>so thank you so much for joining me<br>hopefully that's given you a little bit<br>more of an understanding<br>about um what what it's like to be a<br>student at the university<br>if you are interested in finding out<br>more about specific programs<br>you can have a look on the webinar page<br>that you use to sign up for this program<br>and
