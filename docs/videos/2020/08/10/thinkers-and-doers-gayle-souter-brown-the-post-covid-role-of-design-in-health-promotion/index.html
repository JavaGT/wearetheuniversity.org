greetings everyone who is joining<br>us here in new zealand<br>and also across the globe and it's nice<br>to see so many<br>different faces and names um it's a<br>pleasure to welcome you<br>to our lecture of gail salter brown as<br>part of our thinkers and doers<br>lecture series my name is bruno marquez<br>and i'm the program director for the<br>landscape architecture program<br>at terenggawanka victoria university of<br>wellington<br>for some of you that have been attending<br>our lecture series in the past<br>um thinkers and doers aims at bringing<br>together practitioners scholars<br>students in the wider community of<br>landscape architects and affiliated<br>design professions<br>to share ideas and to hear the latest<br>innovations in the field<br>especially in this time of international<br>pandemic<br>so this is the initiative between the<br>new zealand institute<br>of landscape architects our wellington<br>branch and<br>the landscape architecture program at<br>victoria university of wellington<br>our sixth speaker gail salter-brown<br>is a health and well-being consultant<br>sustainably connecting young and old<br>back<br>to nature she uses collective<br>storytelling and community involvement<br>in a design process<br>to boost community health and workplace<br>well-being<br>she's the founder of greenstone design<br>uk<br>in 20 in 2006 and she expanded to new<br>zealand<br>in 2012. her practice takes a<br>collaborative co-design approach and<br>focus on urban ecology<br>mental health occupational therapy and<br>education<br>of professionals that all come under the<br>same umbrella<br>you may also recognize her she is the<br>author of<br>landscaping urban design for health and<br>wellbeing<br>from rockledge in 2014 and she is also a<br>member of<br>the international federation of<br>landscape architects advisory circle<br>since 2017 she is also known<br>locally and internationally for making<br>the complex seem simple<br>and her research in global practice<br>ate projects at a variety of scales<br>in housing leisure education health and<br>business<br>so her lecture will be looking at a very<br>topical situation that we are all facing<br>to post covides in our recession in<br>economy<br>where designers will be expected to add<br>value to communities and environments<br>in new ways and health promotion to<br>ensure the public<br>immune system is as strong as possible<br>can be achieved through design and<br>design can be a powerful tool in shaping<br>behavior<br>and and change so uh according to gail<br>the devil as always is in the detail<br>uh some just very briefly how skipping<br>rules<br>so gail will be sharing her screen so<br>keep this window open so you can see the<br>slides<br>please remain muted throughout the talk<br>to avoid any background noise<br>and at the end there will be plenty of<br>time for questions you can either ask<br>them<br>verbally or write them on a text on a<br>chat box<br>so please join me to give a very warm<br>welcome to gail<br>uh kia ora everybody and thank you bruno<br>i will<br>share my screen here um hang on<br>no i don't think i've done that yet here<br>okay so hopefully you can now see what<br>i'm seeing<br>and i thought um when bruno invited me<br>to um to talk to you this morning<br>in this post-covered world i thought<br>rather than sort of<br>giving a a lecture per se that a<br>reflection on<br>on research and practice what we've been<br>doing greenstone design over the last<br>well 30 years i guess in total um<br>might might sort of um be of interest<br>so i've just finished um phd<br>looking at the effect of landscape<br>design<br>and health um<br>within a um a very structured health<br>framework so um<br>this all the the uh the images<br>uh on the slides are chosen for a reason<br>so remember this one<br>um this is the beginning so here we go<br>so sheep in a field heading uphill<br>and that's what it feels like often that<br>it's an uphill journey and you've got<br>somebody leading out the front and then<br>the rest follow so this is what we're<br>aiming for<br>so urban landscapes around the world<br>are remarkably similar actually many<br>similar features<br>so they are managed like the image on<br>the left<br>to be low care low maintenance<br>um but are fairly sterile environments<br>so yes they've got grass yes they've got<br>trees yes it qualifies as<br>as green space as open space<br>but they don't do much more than provide<br>that<br>that tree and that that grass area the<br>image on the right<br>um is another very common example that<br>ubiquitous<br>urban plaza that has formal structural<br>planting<br>it's got fixed seating it's<br>it's there and it's an architectural<br>statement<br>but again it doesn't do much<br>other than have somewhere to sit and and<br>some trees<br>so more on that shortly<br>so given that this was my start point<br>this was<br>what we're all familiar with as a design<br>practice very early on we said okay<br>what's going to be our point of<br>difference in a crowded market<br>effectively<br>and having a family full of of<br>healthcare professionals um from gps to<br>to consultants across the huge range of<br>disciplines um<br>i was interested in in health from um<br>an early age and mental health<br>well-being as that affects physical<br>health<br>and i thought how can i turn my interest<br>my passion for trees for the environment<br>for people<br>into something that became a targeted<br>effective tool so<br>why are raison d'etre as such is<br>all around stress stress impacts<br>well-being<br>and so um the the photo here of<br>this chap sleeping is<br>in the middle of his workplace<br>and what we did in this particular<br>workspace<br>was create a space where people could<br>come rest and restore<br>and he felt sufficiently safe to be able<br>to sleep<br>in view of his boss which took some<br>doing um<br>but lifestyle related diseases so some<br>cancers heart disease<br>depression anxiety obesity are all<br>linked<br>so what i know from<br>my phd is design can reduce stress<br>so if we know that design can reduce<br>stress or add to it<br>what would we rather do okay um so<br>there's<br>our incentive now the invitation<br>to thriving in the city and what does<br>that take what does that look like<br>to create something that is inherently<br>low cost so<br>not low value but it doesn't cost the<br>earth<br>for a very high impact initiative to<br>create a healthy<br>health creating society and this concept<br>of a health creating society<br>is something that we're going to be<br>hearing more of going forward so<br>um lord nigel crisp the ex-chief exec of<br>the national health service in the uk<br>he just launched a book two weeks ago<br>called<br>health happens at home hospitals after<br>repairs<br>and the health systems around the world<br>were overworked prior to covert with the<br>advent of covert the first major<br>pandemic<br>um okay we've had science we've had mers<br>ebola but this is this has taken the<br>world<br>um by by surprise in so many ways<br>and so we now need to be focusing on a<br>health<br>creating society that puts us in a<br>stronger position<br>for the next pandemic that will come<br>down the line so<br>all the science says that with climate<br>change we are looking at<br>increasing numbers of pandemics and so<br>what do we do<br>to boost the collective immunity<br>of of society as designers<br>we have the knowledge we have the<br>evidence to put that into effect<br>which takes us right back to the<br>beginning of the professions<br>in terms of landscape architecture and<br>urban planning<br>we're firmly focused back at the end of<br>the 19th century and first half of the<br>20th century<br>on public health and then with the<br>that focus on the environment slipped<br>away but that's coming back again<br>so what we know we know that<br>environmental design can significantly<br>reduce stress<br>now when we use significantly as a<br>scientist<br>we're talking about statistical<br>significance and that's<br>when the medical profession the<br>healthcare profession<br>sit up and take notice so this is an<br>objective measure<br>um so with my through my phd i<br>measured salivary stress cortisol and<br>that's the hormone cortisol<br>is a hormone that tests your<br>physiological state<br>so you may say i feel fine but your<br>cortisol would tell us<br>regardless of how you think you feel how<br>your body's<br>actually responding to a given moment in<br>time<br>so we found that through various design<br>interventions<br>we can just statistically significantly<br>reduce<br>chronic stress which is then late<br>back to all those lifestyle related<br>diseases we also found<br>really surprisingly um and happily<br>that environmental design can be<br>protective<br>so for those few people in<br>my research group so we had 164 people<br>that we were<br>working with as a randomized control<br>trial<br>for the few people whose cortisol levels<br>went up<br>even after exposure to the biodiverse<br>after time in that biodiverse sensory<br>rich environment<br>their perceived well-being went up even<br>if their cortisol levels had increased<br>now for people who had been uh we had a<br>randomized control trial which means<br>that you have a control group a formal<br>control that<br>go about life as normal and then i had a<br>comparative intervention group<br>who spent time in that plaza that we<br>looked at earlier<br>and then this image here is in a<br>sensory garden that i created my living<br>laboratory as such<br>um full of study<br>so people in the plaza if their cortisol<br>livers had gone up their well-being went<br>down which is the normal expectation<br>that<br>you feel worse because you're more<br>stressed<br>but to be able to have the protective<br>effect<br>having been in this biodiverse sensory<br>rich space<br>is fascinating and that's something that<br>needs to be<br>explored further so there's there's a<br>research<br>um focus for anybody who's entering into<br>the research journey<br>um yeah happy to guide mentor you<br>um supervise your phd through that<br>further exploration we also found that<br>healthy active lifestyles which are key<br>to public health<br>and there are all sorts of programs<br>and massive health budgets spent on<br>stopping<br>smoking anti-obesity<br>anti-addictive behaviors<br>getting people moving all of that<br>happened<br>naturally after time in this biodiverse<br>sensory rich space so<br>that all happens when we get the design<br>right<br>however we're dealing within a<br>marketplace that is<br>full of perceptions that become the<br>reality of<br>the holders of those perceptions but the<br>reality<br>is where we need to be focused and so<br>that we can then guide people<br>through their perceptions so it becomes<br>a change management exercise<br>so it becomes a very gentle sense of<br>the r of reality being focused<br>first and foremost on the environment so<br>that healthy ecology<br>when we talk about accessibility we're<br>not just talking about<br>ramps and handrails we're talking about<br>what does it take to be an accessible<br>space for somebody with<br>mental health accessibility issues or<br>physical health<br>accessibility issues what is it that<br>these people need<br>so we've got all the information on that<br>also that's all written up that's there<br>in the literature<br>cost um now it's not so much low cost<br>and some people get put off by that<br>because they think<br>hang on if we are designing something<br>that is based on a percentage fee base<br>um we don't want to go low cost we want<br>the highest cost we possibly can<br>but it's about value for money and<br>adding value<br>so we just needed an l there for the<br>reality so it's that sense<br>of adding value to the<br>to whatever budget we're dealing with<br>but knowing that by putting the emphasis<br>on the environment<br>we're not putting it on the the bells<br>and whistles as such we're not talking<br>about<br>the bronze sculpture in the corner we're<br>talking about what<br>actually we need to create those health<br>and well-being<br>outcomes from the design<br>so it needs to be impactful<br>and how you measure that impact<br>and is it enough we'll talk in the next<br>um slide<br>around how we measure our impact<br>and trust establishing trust<br>with across the stakeholder group is<br>essential<br>because if we're going to hold their<br>hand through<br>challenging their perceptions they've<br>got to trust<br>they've got to trust the science they've<br>got to trust<br>the professional who is presenting that<br>science<br>and we've got to remember that we're<br>dealing with young and old able and<br>differently abled<br>we've got an aging society but in parts<br>of the world parts of new zealand<br>we've got a very young community<br>and what does a design intervention<br>for those people look like and how is<br>so trust gets a separate slide all of<br>its own because<br>this photo was um taken in the forest at<br>the back of um<br>university of berkeley when i was there<br>with<br>claire cooper marcus which some of you<br>whom some of you will know<br>so<br>testing having the confidence<br>to test yourself but also to be<br>tested and creating that relationship<br>with the client with the stakeholders to<br>say we might not get this right first<br>time<br>but let's test out the ideas<br>that's part of the sense of trust<br>is running a trial and saying let's do<br>something small here<br>and if we see the health outcomes and we<br>we measure those we measure their impact<br>then we can go back<br>and do more or we can tweak around the<br>edges<br>if we find that it's not working<br>entirely as expected<br>in some way again it comes back to this<br>responsibility<br>to say we are as a profession<br>designers we are able to<br>effect public health in a way that<br>very few other professions can quite so<br>significantly<br>and that statistically significantly<br>clinically significantly and socially<br>significantly<br>so<br>it's up to us to to utilize that<br>responsibility<br>and understanding of the wider issues at<br>play so<br>everything that we do if we say it's<br>around ecological health<br>then understanding the flow and effect<br>of that with climate health<br>and human health and well-being it's all<br>interconnected<br>sense of of indigenous wisdom that says<br>we've got this and that knowledge is<br>there and it's within<br>all of our communities but it's just a<br>question of drawing that out<br>and then we're treating the people as a<br>town<br>the people are the treasure so we're not<br>just<br>saying yes we've got a space that looks<br>good<br>but we're actually going back to human<br>centered design if we treat the people<br>as a talented<br>then we get the sense of<br>what's right for them actually has to be<br>right for the environment as well<br>works on scientific evidence which then<br>says<br>how can we objectively evaluate our work<br>and how do we objectively evaluate the<br>work of others so we've got things<br>you know mechanisms like post occupancy<br>evaluations<br>and um one of my examiners<br>uh for my phd i don't know if she's part<br>of<br>this zoom session was professor mardell<br>shipley who's the head of school of<br>landscape art<br>of architecture at cornell university<br>and i my response was it's very<br>difficult<br>which is why i did the randomized<br>control trial which is very unusual<br>within the design profession because it<br>absolutely<br>puts yourself as a as a design<br>professional out there it may have been<br>that my design didn't work<br>it was a failure however that's the<br>science<br>that says well a failure is still a<br>result<br>but being open to that how do we<br>objectively evaluate our work in the<br>work of others<br>so that's a key question to store away<br>in the back of your brain<br>what is evidence if three people say<br>this is what happened to them<br>does that become evidence or do you need<br>30 people to say that would you need 300<br>people to say that<br>or do you need people from various<br>cultural groups<br>you need people from various climate<br>zones<br>so how do you build a body of evidence<br>a published body of evidence in the<br>academic journals but are they available<br>are they accessible to<br>the average practitioner probably not<br>which is where it becomes more a gut<br>instinct look it's worked here so we'll<br>do this<br>here but is that actually working on<br>evidence no it's not<br>and then we've got the question of okay<br>so if we put<br>evidence up on a pedestal and say look<br>if we are designing for health and<br>well-being<br>we need to be evidence-based medicine is<br>evidence-based<br>because you don't just work on a hunch<br>and we'll try a drug and see what<br>happens<br>so in this post-covert world where we<br>are looking at<br>public health interventions at health<br>promoting interventions<br>to create this healthy health creating<br>society<br>where is evidence best applied in social<br>housing<br>and healthcare and education<br>perhaps not down the side of a motorway<br>in the middle of a um<br>a planting re-vegetation<br>scheme but in our urban settings<br>wherever people are nearby pass by<br>regularly<br>evidence<br>so part of my research um was to<br>create well it wasn't part of my<br>research but one of my research outputs<br>was to create a new um model of of<br>health<br>and so um bronfen brenner is the um<br>the author of the sociological um model<br>of the determinants of health<br>and engels is the author of the<br>echo biosocial psychosocial model of<br>health<br>and both of those models they talk about<br>the importance of environment<br>as a determinant of health but nobody<br>was talking about the quality of the<br>environment<br>and so that was one of the big learnings<br>to come out of my research<br>which is being published shortly<br>uh submitted to the journals last week<br>in fact was<br>the sense of the quality of the<br>environment and it is that biodiverse<br>environment<br>that is as the heart of this<br>virtuous cycle of well-being so the<br>integrated salutogenic design for<br>well-being model<br>captures our ability as<br>designers to<br>connect people socially to reduce stress<br>thereby enhance well-being<br>which then connects them back to nature<br>the nature connection doesn't happen<br>without<br>that biodiverse environment and that<br>then fuels the cycle<br>so evidence-based links between design<br>planning principles<br>and health outcomes where do we fit in<br>all of this<br>hopefully you're getting a bit of a<br>sense of of the answer yourself and in<br>the chat afterwards<br>um yeah i'd love to discuss this with<br>you so the role of the designer<br>so i have a uh yes here we go it's on<br>the desk here somewhere<br>can we see this um yeah<br>so this says foxhealth's arbiter<br>and so the world health organization<br>gave me this<br>wristband to say that i am a public<br>health worker<br>so<br>in norwegian um<br>so we are able to be public health<br>professionals so it's a new way<br>well it's an old way but it's a new way<br>for us currently<br>of thinking about what we can do and how<br>we can affect<br>change so i pose the question<br>is this space healthy or unhealthy now<br>this was one of the biggest surprises<br>of my research so i had a comparative<br>intervention<br>space i had a ecologically<br>healthy sensory rich biodiverse space so<br>i kind of figured that this<br>might be less um impactful<br>than the other space but what i wasn't<br>expecting was that this space<br>did measurable harm and so all the<br>trends<br>across all of the measures having spent<br>time<br>in this space in this plaza space with<br>the trees<br>and the seats in the open space<br>in the green background the same amount<br>of sky so the same physical space 900<br>square meters<br>was negative<br>so productivity went down well-being<br>went down perceived stress went through<br>the roof<br>nature relatedness went down so people<br>felt less inclined<br>to respond to their environment<br>um it was fascinating<br>so the natural in the built environment<br>um<br>together and this is something<br>that we need to address as a profession<br>also<br>so together this this natural and built<br>environments play a key role in shaping<br>health outcomes<br>so previously the lack of causal<br>evidence<br>so that's that absolute cause and effect<br>and it's really difficult<br>to prove anything to prove causality to<br>say<br>this happened because of that<br>and so because we couldn't prove it this<br>because of that it was used to justify<br>the status quo<br>but with the new data from my study<br>we've got<br>so we now know<br>what does harm and we know what does<br>good and so it becomes a question of<br>extrapolating that out<br>and applying it so<br>the solution as such is to create the<br>climate which allows people to thrive<br>um this photo was taken in the workplace<br>and mama had to bring her child to work<br>for the day and so by having created<br>a space where mum could sit and work so<br>she had a bean bag that she could pick<br>up<br>and move to so she's actually sitting on<br>the edge of a pond there with a little<br>waterfall beside her while her son<br>played nearby<br>of sand that became an urban beach as<br>such<br>so he was happy he was an environment<br>that was safe<br>and she was 10 meters<br>from the building from her office but<br>she was able to step outside<br>and at the same time look after a son so<br>this is this idea of<br>thriving which goes beyond simple<br>well-being<br>and we do this by reducing stress by<br>connecting people<br>to nature first of all and connecting<br>people to people so creating those<br>spaces<br>for people to come together so um<br>my research was in fact a workplace<br>wellbeing study which is one we've got<br>some<br>so the vision for all of this is to<br>explore<br>the social determinants of health<br>differently those physic the physical<br>so this photo i took when i was in paris<br>and um the mayor of paris uh<br>and hildago has a wonderful vision<br>for public health for her her<br>her community and had a shortage of<br>public open space of green space and so<br>this was down<br>on the periphery what used to be the<br>major ring road around<br>and it's been greened and it's<br>biodiverse it's sensory rich<br>it's quiet it's low cost<br>um but it's this public space that<br>becomes very private space<br>that has nooks and crannies where you<br>can hide yourself away but you can still<br>see art<br>you can still be seen but it's got these<br>spaces of retreat<br>right there in the middle of the city<br>this is this exploration of physical and<br>social space<br>so by enhancing environmental quality<br>we're going back<br>to the root of the integrated<br>salutogenic um model for well-being<br>to create this healthy health-creating<br>society<br>so beat stress excuse me move more<br>um was a project that i worked on which<br>where we designed in the cause into the<br>solution<br>so people don't exercise because they're<br>too stressed<br>so how do you get them to move well<br>you've got to address the cause the root<br>cause<br>and so this was what we found was that<br>they then spontaneously went out and saw<br>more physical activity<br>at whatever level was comfortable for<br>them healthy ecology<br>was the key well part of the key<br>and the other was the management of the<br>space now here we've got long grass<br>in the city now for some of my research<br>participants it was the first time they<br>had<br>seen long grass because we live in<br>manicured<br>in fact in the countryside it's pretty<br>hard to see long grass um in many places<br>also<br>of the slightly untouched and seeing<br>what pops up through the grass<br>now this is actually kikuyu which um<br>is not ideal i'd have to say it as a as<br>a meadow grass species<br>but that was part of the budget<br>constraints um<br>but all sorts of stuff did come up<br>through it in terms of color<br>and texture but we had the soft grass<br>that was then at hand height so that as<br>people walked through they would brush<br>their hands<br>through the tops of the grass and then<br>we had mine paths through there<br>and that was really challenging to a<br>very practical level<br>um on a practical level to the estate's<br>managers<br>and so that was a vital part of that<br>stakeholder engagement<br>was to bring them along on the journey<br>to say this is what we're doing<br>and why so having the sense of<br>wild in the city was really important<br>which takes us to this co-creation and<br>so we talk a lot about co-design and<br>co-creation<br>but it's so much more than just<br>so bringing everybody along on the<br>journey<br>is what ensures this enduring result<br>this sustainable result<br>otherwise you've got that flash in the<br>pan idea that you know<br>um the one-minute wonder<br>so we don't all hold<br>none of us can hold all the knowledge<br>and so if you are in doubt at any stage<br>don't be afraid to call in an expert and<br>that's what i have<br>loved throughout my research um<br>process and my professional practice<br>is meeting people meeting experts and<br>saying<br>hey look i'm working on this i've got<br>this idea but i've never done it before<br>would you be prepared to help me to to<br>share<br>and people are so willing to share<br>and then we create this network of<br>like-minded individuals<br>who are working altruistically<br>for the greater good of the profession<br>so salutogenic urban design saluted<br>genesis<br>comes back to this health creating<br>health promoting<br>um<br>so if we think in terms of wildlife<br>corridors<br>and how we've got a conception of what a<br>wildlife corridor might look like<br>across a city or across a town<br>we need to be thinking of how we put<br>people into<br>this the sense of moving people through<br>um when i was putting these slides<br>together i couldn't find the slide that<br>i was looking for that actually had a<br>cycle route through under the trees but<br>anyway<br>you get the idea that it's about<br>what's good for the wildlife is good for<br>and we need this connection so as we<br>said<br>we were talking about connecting people<br>to nature and people to people<br>but it's also that connection between<br>and so that's working right from the<br>get-go on a new project<br>with the project architects to say<br>where are people going to come from<br>what's their view out going to be<br>so that landscape's not the afterthought<br>but it is<br>front of mind to create that health<br>promotion<br>what do we need and it is that<br>green view and it is that access ready<br>access to<br>so that when you need to take a break<br>going back to the workplace well-being<br>you can just pop outside<br>breathe the free share go back inside<br>again<br>excuse me so creating those access<br>points<br>so we need to be there having those<br>conversations early on<br>and we can do that when mandated with<br>providing health promotion outcomes<br>so spaces fundamentally need to be<br>engaging and enabling<br>the photo on the left is in berlin and<br>this is a little roadside verge where<br>in many cities around new zealand at the<br>moment<br>little rain gardens are going in well<br>rather than having a rain garden the<br>residents here so<br>everybody's living in an apartment um<br>above<br>street level so street level we've got<br>um shops uh retail<br>light manufacturing and then<br>residential above and so one of the<br>residents<br>claimed this space put a little pickup<br>fence around it<br>and said this is mine and the city let<br>her<br>allowed her to claim the space and so<br>there's a little seat in this space<br>she's got an arbor there she's got a<br>bird feeders<br>in the middle of the busy city on the<br>side of the footpath<br>and as we move to urban densification<br>and we need to build in design in<br>health and well-being outcomes we've got<br>to be thinking<br>in terms of that sense of ownership<br>of a space and allowing that and how we<br>affect that<br>through design do we just leave it<br>and let the people create<br>their own environment or do we work with<br>them and say<br>hey anybody here in this building like<br>to do something<br>here's our opportunity we've got this<br>much money left over as our budget<br>having done the street works so those<br>are conversations to be had<br>photo on the right um was in a social<br>housing development<br>and um there was a bit of a porch out<br>the front and you can just see<br>in the middle here um a steel<br>pipe so it was a very basic steel<br>galvanized steel support post for this<br>veranda<br>it was sort of gray and ugly and so what<br>we did was<br>we just framed it up very simply<br>and so that we could grow fragrant vines<br>up there<br>put in our spring bulbs<br>and now there's this sense of beauty<br>and pride in this little darling<br>comes out here and she waters her babies<br>on a daily basis um<br>and so it's that enabling people to<br>interact with their environment<br>where they are on a daily basis through<br>very simple interventions<br>so we started um with a picture of sheep<br>and the sense that the environment is<br>important for health and well-being<br>and it's not just the urban environment<br>and so i wanted to just acknowledge that<br>rural environments<br>our property um we've got a rural<br>property<br>in canterbury in new zealand which<br>is in so many ways idyllic but so many<br>people in the community<br>and that's another piece of research<br>is looking at the influence of<br>agrochemicals<br>and an incidence of cancer<br>so what we do know is that what is good<br>for plants and animals is good for<br>humans and vice versa so we've got to<br>concentrate firstly on<br>healthy soil and this is in the middle<br>of the heart of the city<br>as much as it is out on a farm it's<br>about water<br>water quality water availability<br>and then managing to store excess as it<br>falls out of the sky<br>it's about trees we need trees wherever<br>we are<br>lots of them short ones tall ones wide<br>ones<br>broad canopy corner shape investigated<br>varieties<br>the whole package deal we need to be<br>providing shelter<br>so that shade that's from rain we need<br>to provide cover that sense of security<br>where you can<br>and we need that in rural areas as much<br>as we do in the city<br>so we're working on a project doing<br>exactly this sort of thing<br>in a rural school at the moment out the<br>back of whanganui<br>which will create all these spaces for<br>these kids<br>in an otherwise flat environment which<br>was much like<br>the uh the campus picture in the first<br>slide<br>so thank you very much um<br>for joining us this morning and may you<br>go forth<br>the new knowledge spread it widely<br>and yeah please feel free to get in<br>touch<br>so uh with the phd i'm now qualified as<br>a community health consultant<br>um salutogenic urban design so what<br>we've done as a practice for a long time<br>is work with councils with developers<br>with<br>fellow design professionals to<br>design advise um and we also do the the<br>um<br>the the full service design from<br>consultancy through<br>so the uk practice um is that the<br>the uh the mother company as such and<br>uh we've got a small office in new<br>zealand as well so we work globally we<br>worked remotely from the get-go which<br>was a bit of a bonus when covert came<br>along<br>and so i'm now in new zealand which is a<br>great place to be locked down<br>and the design team in the uk and they<br>get on and do their thing<br>so please do feel free to get in touch<br>but now um<br>yeah please uh yeah<br>thank you gail for that very inspiring<br>lecture um<br>it's they are all topics very um dear to<br>me<br>um and it's graduated you know to see<br>the work you are doing to<br>really bridge the gap between design<br>disciplines<br>before you know opening the floor and<br>allowing people to<br>you know to formulate their questions i<br>think<br>um my question is in relation to the<br>design professions into landscape<br>architecture<br>overall um what are the changes<br>that you foresee in our<br>daily practices that need to happen to<br>accommodate<br>all these information that you just gave<br>us around health and well-being<br>i think we need to open up the<br>information channels<br>so that it's all very well<br>you know sort of having all this<br>knowledge but being able to put the<br>knowledge into action<br>is what's absolutely vital and that was<br>something um<br>that was very evident working through<br>things like literature reviews<br>um within my research<br>was to say okay so we know all this<br>stuff so why is it not happening<br>so that's a project that i'm working on<br>at the moment we've got a funding ground<br>and<br>to actually put knowledge into action so<br>we need<br>as not as an academic but but as a<br>practitioner to be seeking out new<br>information<br>and so that then puts a responsibility<br>on the publishers<br>to make that information available and<br>so many of the<br>but i guess part of that what changes on<br>a daily basis then<br>is to have that curiosity<br>as a design practice to say where else<br>could i look i'm not finding what i'm<br>looking for here<br>i wonder if it's over there and i think<br>that was probably what i did<br>differently um early on<br>like in the early 2000s was we we had<br>clients<br>health condition and we had to go on<br>research and there was no<br>sort of information available within<br>landscape journals<br>but we found something specifically in a<br>health journal or an<br>ecology journal and then triangulating<br>all that information bringing it all<br>together<br>integrating it all um i think that yeah<br>i'm talking with you like i also<br>experienced this<br>in my in my job like sometimes<br>what you find there's very much valuable<br>information especially<br>in health disciplines and and you know<br>and they just don't know what to do with<br>it<br>because they are not designers and and<br>we are the designers but<br>we sometimes don't have the time<br>especially in practice you don't really<br>have the time to do more thorough<br>research and<br>just to jump in is where um<br>it's part of that education and creating<br>that trust with the client to say<br>if you want to achieve these outcomes<br>it's going to take some time because i'm<br>going to need to do some research and<br>just<br>listening and say saying no<br>to a job um seems sort of<br>inherently wrong on so many levels but<br>we've got to be realistic<br>and say this is what's important this is<br>what's at stake<br>and this is what's going to be involved<br>and it might take me another week<br>to pull this information together to put<br>us in a position<br>to inform the design brief because the<br>clients only know what they know<br>they don't know the potential so we've<br>got a massive education progress<br>uh program that's needed to affect this<br>change<br>across communities everywhere totally<br>um opening the floor to other questions<br>from<br>don't forget to unmute yourself before<br>starting<br>i don't know gal if you have been<br>reading the chat box but there is very<br>yeah<br>and we have rosalind saying best urban<br>design<br>architecture webinar for a very long<br>time<br>thank you rosalind emily's saying<br>that was fascinating very very inspiring<br>and we have phillips is saying as<br>designers our power<br>is the power of influence and covet<br>crisis has revealed that the focus on<br>efficiency from health to education is<br>philip that's a really good point and so<br>resilience<br>is all about building up that sense of<br>self<br>and what um we found with our research<br>and as a practice um so we've had all<br>this anecdotal evidence which i guess is<br>what prompted me to then formalize that<br>anecdotal evidence<br>um through the phd process was people<br>were telling us clients were telling us<br>that<br>they felt better in and of themselves<br>and function better<br>and that was across the the demographic<br>age and ability wise<br>and culture so to be able to build this<br>resilience in through<br>creating that environmental resilience<br>is just it's a beautiful synergistic<br>sort of a<br>an opportunity and it is this<br>opportunity that i firmly believe we've<br>obsessed<br>or otherwise the engineers will take<br>over and we'll be somewhat obsolete<br>because there are some fabulous<br>environmental engineers around<br>and they are doing great things but they<br>haven't got<br>that detailed knowledge of things like<br>planting plants you know the most basic<br>things that we can<br>fundamentally change the feeling of a<br>space<br>through something as simple as choosing<br>okay any final remarks what's what's<br>next for you<br>what what's next for me is um<br>i had hoped to have a holiday i finished<br>my phd<br>um the last week of lockdown and um<br>so did my my oral defense um and my<br>examiners were as i mentioned the the<br>head of school of the architecture at<br>cornell university<br>and the head of public health um at<br>auckland university of technology and so<br>it was a rigorous process let me tell<br>you<br>and so having done a multi-disciplinary<br>phd<br>um which is unusual in and of itself so<br>links together architecture health and<br>ecology so to pull those threads<br>together<br>you was busy um<br>but what we're doing now is we're<br>putting that into action and people<br>have been um emailing it on the phone<br>saying okay<br>what can we do so we've got um city<br>council saying we need<br>um urban densification but we need to<br>design and health and wellbeing at the<br>same time how do we do this<br>so what's next is seeing where this goes<br>so<br>change to to share this um to to<br>do more lectures like this to spread the<br>word i think i'll need to write another<br>book<br>um so routledge press<br>um my editor is saying okay right um<br>let's work on this and so i've written<br>nine<br>three four book chapters while i was<br>doing the phd<br>so um there's some stuff coming out that<br>will share some more of this<br>generally published but it is about<br>getting that you know the next step is<br>about getting this information out there<br>and putting it into practice yeah best<br>time ever<br>oh look absolutely it's great it's a lot<br>of fun<br>i think i think like it's also<br>interesting<br>um and hopefully you have um you know<br>a time to export it as well it's really<br>awesome to share with the world how much<br>we can learn from our indigenous culture<br>in new zealand<br>absolutely especially around health and<br>well-being because yeah<br>it's such a different understanding in<br>comparison to the western understanding<br>of health and well-being<br>and it is that holistic sense of<br>bringing it all together that yeah<br>i think it's beautiful it is yeah it's<br>effective what's more<br>and it's that sort of intuitive<br>knowledge that<br>that we've known fit forever the<br>gardens that nature landscape is<br>health promoting is supportive of us but<br>we<br>lost that along the way absolutely to<br>bring that back in<br>thank you very much for such an<br>inspiring morning<br>uh it is here in new zealand um i'm sure<br>that's uh people that are across the<br>globe and it's evening for them is gonna<br>sit with them for a little while before<br>going to sleep<br>um i think for us was a great way to<br>start the morning<br>uh such an engaging lecture in st and<br>mentally stimulating<br>um thank you for that um and i wish you<br>all the best<br>uh now with all the different projects<br>that<br>keep you all very busy<br>and good luck with all the writings and<br>i hope that um i can see you face to<br>look forward yeah exactly<br>and thank you everyone for attending uh<br>whatever your bags here in new zealand<br>or uh across<br>across the globe um thank you very much<br>for attending our<br>thinkers endures lecture i wish you all<br>the best and i hope to see you in two<br>weeks from<br>out great thanks
