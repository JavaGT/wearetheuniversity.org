As a landscape architect with a design, engineering, and fine arts background, his teaching, research, and creative works ultimately come back to people, place, and the fertile intersections where these meet.<br><br>Roberto has received recognition for his work as an educator and professional by prominent organizations like the ASLA, the CELA, the Architectural League, the AIA, and others. Fast Company magazine recently selected his EcoAtlas Project as a World Changing Idea finalist and he was recognized with an Emerging Voice award by the Architectural League in New York, one of the most coveted awards in North American Architecture. Roberto has been lead designer in national and international projects and his work ranges from environmental installations and competitions, to art commissions and landscape architectural projects.<br><br>‘Thinkers and Doers’ aims to bring together practitioners, scholars, students and the wider community of landscape architecture and affiliated built environment disciplines to share ideas and to hear the latest innovations in the field. This online series brings together nationally and internationally renowned experts through an initiative between the NZILA Wellington Branch and the Landscape Architecture Programme at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good morning and

joined by<br>an ingenious and clever designer<br>roberto rivera in miami florida i have<br>been fortunate enough to not only be<br>educated by roberto my formal years<br>but work in his practice for a few years<br>his interests<br>pedagogy and sharp eye for pop place and<br>pragmatism still remain rooted in my<br>core values<br>as a landscape architect today in new<br>zealand<br>roberto is a registered landscape<br>architect the principal of studio<br>roberto rivera<br>an associate professor and the chair of<br>the landscape architecture environmental<br>and urban design at florida<br>international university in miami<br>as a highly recognized educator and<br>professional by prominent organizat<br>organizations<br>such as the council of educators in<br>landscape architecture<br>american society of landscape architects<br>the architectural league and many others<br>roberto has worked and designed<br>internationally and across different<br>media and scope including<br>environmental installations competitions<br>arts and art commissions his lecture<br>today<br>will cover design and research projects<br>whose approach<br>tries to connect cultural and natural<br>factors in their built in conceptual<br>form<br>without losing the speaker at this point<br>i will now pass the presentation to<br>roberto for 25 minute lecture<br>followed by a five to ten minute<br>question and answer<br>and uh just a couple of house rules that<br>roberto will be sharing his screen if<br>you could please put your<br>microphone on mute and hold the<br>questions till the end<br>so thank you roberto for joining us<br>today<br>thank you brennan um can you hear me<br>okay<br>yes wonderful well it's great to be here<br>and i'm really honored um and i want to<br>thank the victoria university of<br>wellington and the new zealand<br>institute of landscape architects for<br>having me um<br>across several time zones and also for<br>some of the friends<br>i see on the screen thank you for<br>joining and some new friends hopefully<br>um so uh i'm honored by the invitation<br>and um<br>i entitled the talk um people place an<br>ecologically informed design<br>i think that these ideas and hopefully<br>the projects and the different<br>investigations that i<br>have prepared will kind of show the way<br>of thinking that drives<br>everything that we do um we have a small<br>practice in miami some very capable<br>outstanding folks among the alumni<br>brennan as he mentioned<br>uh so without further ado um let me get<br>rolling here<br>um and i think that um probably one of<br>the things that<br>uh informs my design is really the place<br>the place where i live the places that<br>i've known<br>uh and in the last year and a half we<br>moved down to<br>just south of miami an area called the<br>redland which is<br>uh the heart of the nurseries and the<br>fruit orchards this just a beautiful<br>landscape<br>that is close to miami but uh but<br>as far away as you can get uh<br>conceptually<br>and you have these amazing materials<br>this is limestone rock that's excavated<br>this is a project that we're doing now<br>um close to where i live actually that's<br>just extracted from the ground lets you<br>do<br>amazing things like build these uh<br>waterfalls that you basically quarry the<br>ground<br>and the the stone itself filters and is<br>a substrate for life<br>and ecology uh you can see here how<br>things just volunteer and attach the<br>multiple perforations<br>the water that it holds uh the<br>vegetation<br>is just uh remarkably upheld by this<br>geological form and this image here is<br>quite striking to me this was<br>uh in the process of installing some<br>oaks recently<br>you see both the uh you know the<br>intentional<br>very planned very orchestrated uh<br>process by which you plant a big tree<br>and then in the foreground here this is<br>a lime rock that just<br>shows this uh this ficus just emerging<br>and irrepressible i have the fortune of<br>living in a place that i can look<br>outside<br>a studio that i just quote unquote<br>finish right before the pandemic<br>and uh you know this is a view of this<br>little<br>neighbor's house that has coral rock<br>that was excavated from the canals that<br>have allowed south florida to thrive<br>and that is again a a substrate that<br>allows for life to take root<br>and irreversibly it gives us great<br>inspiration it allows us to create<br>things like this which is a project that<br>we're doing here in miami<br>where we take these things outside of<br>the ground we plant them<br>we irrigate them and they just take off<br>uh but in many ways uh where i live is<br>informed by<br>those who live here among them this is<br>one of our dogs a stray that we<br>uh allowed in uh just opened the gate<br>and he joined us this is whiskey<br>and the uncut grass the contrast here<br>is actually an experiment that led to<br>some uh<br>investigations and ideas um over the<br>last year or so<br>where i left unmowed the areas that i'm<br>planning to<br>build or excavate or turn into one of<br>the ponds or<br>building etc and what it has allowed me<br>to do is to see the landscape<br>and just in the restraint of not<br>treating it and not<br>mowing and allowing for these areas to<br>just do their own thing<br>um these amazing juxtapositions take<br>place where you see<br>control and lack of control and over<br>time some<br>are newer like these patches and some<br>are older where<br>whiskey might one of my dogs was um and<br>it just takes a<br>takes a its own sort of momentum<br>and so this is the environment that<br>inspires me every day<br>it's a it's a really wonderful place and<br>it's just a matter of<br>looking at it from multiple scales i'd<br>like to do that in our practice<br>from the micro to the macro from the<br>regional to the local to the site<br>and really understand how these various<br>gradients and fuzzy edges give us<br>a chance to better understand where<br>where we live and where we work<br>a lot of what we do is actually uh also<br>involves doing temporary installations<br>i view these as basically 3d sketches<br>and this is one that i always go back to<br>the dry dock loom<br>this was done in this gigantic dry dock<br>in california<br>where uh basically from the top here to<br>the bottom it's about 45 feet or so in<br>height to give you a sense of scale<br>and this was one of the most productive<br>environments during world war ii and<br>shipbuilding<br>we took this over we took 13 000 linear<br>feet of yarn<br>strung it about 16 feet off the ground<br>and created<br>this effect which is almost like this<br>hovering horizon<br>of blue which mimics what the water is<br>doing behind this<br>uh this wall this dam the ship's<br>uh this gets flooded ships used to be<br>brought in<br>and then the doors door closes<br>and it gets drained and this allows for<br>access to the hall<br>it just sits there as this you know<br>majestic theater that's empty most of<br>the time because that<br>that shipyard closed uh in 1995 and it's<br>just a great setting to experiment like<br>this<br>what this installation taught me and<br>continues to teach me is just how<br>minimal and subtle and you know small<br>transformations that benefit from<br>a a collective total<br>uh when done in a place that gives it<br>that contrast that juxtaposition of<br>lightness and ephemerality<br>next to this massive you know unmoving<br>void just heightens the lightness and<br>heightens the weight<br>of both of these things and it's just as<br>a designer<br>um you know as someone who<br>you know does these installations as an<br>art form<br>these situations in juxta and these<br>juxtapositions<br>really sensitize you to the potential of<br>a site<br>another project that took place also<br>before moving to miami<br>in 2005 we did this project in um<br>in california that in the same shipyard<br>that had a uh basically it was was a<br>mapping of the ground<br>and this gives you again a sense of the<br>scale this is a person here that's kind<br>of<br>uh in a very active shipyard and so what<br>we did is we took<br>um plates of steel and we located these<br>in formerly productive sites a shipyard<br>a staging ground<br>uh and a navy tool shed place these<br>things on the ground<br>these are about four foot by four foot<br>that's the dimension there<br>let them weather over time and then<br>after<br>a couple of months stop that process of<br>transformation<br>and i painted them based on the patterns<br>that were created by the water movement<br>and then sealed them and what it does is<br>it creates this uh<br>documentation of deposition<br>oxidation erosion all captured in the<br>surface of the metal which is<br>a part of the landscape until the moment<br>that it is removed<br>so in a way it's i call it a land print<br>it's a one-to-one print of the ground<br>but ultimately it's a documenting the<br>process of transformation<br>and movement of water over time<br>and oftentimes we see these patterns in<br>terms of how it's reflected in<br>vegetation plant material organisms that<br>thrive at these edges<br>and this process of of capturing<br>that transformation via these prints are<br>basically stopping time to look at it<br>a project that we did as part of a<br>competition where we were<br>lucky to get an honorable mention was<br>actually in san francisco<br>and this was i i picked this project<br>because not only does it speak to the<br>idea that<br>uh time is central to a lot of the work<br>that we do<br>and it's and if you can harness it<br>properly<br>it just reaps rewards in immeasurable<br>ways but<br>this was actually a part of the garden<br>the san francisco botanical garden<br>wanted to communicate the historical<br>significance of<br>gondwanaland in relation to the<br>communities in the southern hemisphere<br>and this is actually a picture i took of<br>the smithsonian showing<br>basically just the the incredible<br>geological scales<br>of which as human beings we are in the<br>top<br>thin uh very very top almost<br>imperceptible<br>um and so gondwanaland uh was actually<br>part of this<br>mass continental mass that was separated<br>before that<br>it was pangaea separated into lauraja<br>and gondwana<br>and um basically it there are<br>relationships which actually new zealand<br>shares with uh<br>chile and south america and parts of the<br>southern hemisphere<br>in terms of the plant material that<br>grows in these these are distant cousins<br>and so<br>the idea of scale and time in this<br>particular project<br>is really important to me to try and<br>explore we began as we usually do<br>by sketching by situating and trying to<br>get an<br>understanding of scale this is close to<br>the young museum you might recognize the<br>structure here<br>and so we started playing with the idea<br>of movement and how continental<br>masses could move over time<br>of course the danger in a project like<br>this is to create a one-liner where you<br>see it almost like a science fair<br>project<br>and you kind of get the one line and you<br>move on<br>so here we wanted to do something that<br>would actually change over time<br>and we selected a tree that you probably<br>know if you're in new zealand the tatara<br>tree the podocarpus tatara<br>which uh basically gets to be<br>a massive tree as as you probably<br>understand if you live there<br>uh and this is part of the plant<br>collection in the san francisco<br>botanical garden so we did is<br>we created the shapes of these<br>continents by outlining their profiles<br>from the ground so you would get an<br>understanding of these continents if you<br>were inside the piece we designed a<br>foundation that would be intentionally<br>shifting the tree would be planted as a<br>sapling at the beginning<br>and the two sides of the foundation<br>would<br>allow for the roots to move through and<br>that would<br>cause the actual uh<br>sculpture to shift and over time<br>uh depending on when you visited it you<br>know you would have a sense of how<br>something<br>starts to move and becomes something<br>else over the course of time and as a<br>function of the growth<br>of the tree um and so this is kind of<br>trying to capture the idea of geological<br>time<br>but in a way that you work with the<br>design to accept the fact that these<br>things will shift<br>and you welcome that change um<br>moving on to a project that's a little<br>bit more local this is a project here in<br>miami the university asked me to<br>leave this design of a courtyard that<br>used to look like what you see on the<br>left<br>here you can see it's somewhat dire<br>red the red mulch uh and just these<br>lonely and solitary uh light posts with<br>no life around them even though 13 000<br>students use that every semester we<br>transformed it into this<br>space and i'll go through and give you a<br>little bit of context there<br>it has since become one of the more<br>popular spots on campus<br>which is very close to a lot of the<br>registrar and libraries and things<br>and it just is a natural gateway for<br>people<br>people to move through the design took<br>this courtyard<br>and created some very large seating<br>that uses the same profile it just flips<br>it so in one it faces in and the other<br>one it faces<br>out uh loose seating uh porous paving<br>and these hanging mesh structures that<br>hold<br>bromeliads or tillancia that are called<br>air plants that don't need any soil to<br>thrive<br>these are the benches they we did a<br>prototype out of<br>pipe and plywood established a<br>profile that will let you stand and lean<br>lean back sit on the edge etc<br>all with a desire to uh focus the<br>attention<br>upward into these light structures that<br>would<br>sway uh because they're untethered<br>and a perimeter that has a trellis that<br>that allows for these blooming<br>uh sky blue vines to um<br>to blossom and it uh the university has<br>blue and gold and we thought what a<br>better way to brand than to use this<br>kind of blue<br>in a very striking way with uh with a<br>recycled glass floor<br>and these are the offices that look into<br>that space<br>and uh quite a welcome transformation<br>from uh what we know of how students<br>post on social media about it<br>and the views up the seating is<br>connected to these structures because it<br>lets you look through the skylight above<br>you<br>and look down and see the various<br>activity we put in<br>a ton of outlets and wi-fi boosters<br>and it's become quite a popular spot<br>taking that idea a little further this<br>is a public art project that i did with<br>a colleague in the school of<br>architecture in the uh<br>college of communication architecture in<br>the arts an artist<br>friend yasser kolashinski and yasik and<br>i<br>were commissioned by the community<br>foundation broward and the ymca<br>these are a non-profit organization<br>and an organization for kids that live<br>on one side of this very<br>uh i call it the penitentiary aesthetic<br>of a bridge<br>they live on one side of this bridge<br>they go to school on the other<br>um and we wanted to create something<br>that would transform that experience<br>so we invited them uh to campus we<br>hosted multiple exercises we took them<br>to the museum and had<br>african-american artists speak to the<br>work that was on exhibit<br>we printed these gigantic aerial<br>photographs we had the kids identify<br>favorites parts of their community areas<br>that needed work and areas that had a<br>wish list<br>and it was really just telling and just<br>so illuminating to<br>take part in that because you really<br>understood some of the needs and the<br>wish lists you know they wanted<br>pools they wanted uh all kinds of of<br>things that<br>that were improvements and this was one<br>of the one of the few times i think<br>in our in our uh understanding that they<br>were asked what they wanted directly<br>um so we developed this exercise where<br>we interviewed and spoke with many of<br>them and we uh<br>listed all the things that they do on a<br>weekly basis all the destinations that<br>they<br>uh that they visited and then we had<br>them go out to the site we created<br>the names of each and we created a<br>series of uh living maps that uh took<br>the trajectory from their home to their<br>school to the ymca to their aunt's house<br>and just created a series of these<br>maps that informed the final<br>configuration of<br>the uh installation that we did we could<br>not touch the bridge<br>because it belongs to the florida<br>turnpike the department of<br>transportation they're typically very<br>challenging to<br>do anything to their structures so<br>instead we created the<br>three of these shape structures on the<br>left three on the right<br>and every day when the kids cross from<br>one side to the other<br>these giant umbrellas are aligned with<br>their trajectory and it changes their<br>path<br>not only that but they have these<br>chain-link fences that we put over a<br>quarter of a million zip ties<br>we had them participate in the<br>installation<br>and every year the graduating class gets<br>several thousand zip ties<br>and they change it according to their uh<br>particular class<br>desire so it's an installation that<br>creates an infrastructure that can be<br>changed and added over time<br>less so on the structures but more<br>directly on the fences that are<br>usually perceived as a negative barriers<br>it also casts a very subtle shadow and<br>it's a pride<br>prideful moment uh for the community and<br>everybody involved<br>lots of people participated in that i'll<br>move quickly through<br>this project which uh brennan knows very<br>well<br>this is in a ruby island of aruba just<br>off the coast of south america<br>off the coast of venezuela aruba is a<br>former uh<br>dutch colony and this park is located in<br>orangestad which is the capital city<br>the site is adjacent to some significant<br>improvements that<br>the aruba was doing to their public<br>transit<br>they placed a trolley stop very close to<br>the park<br>they have an academy that is an art and<br>design academy across from the park so<br>we felt that this was an outside<br>classroom<br>we looked at the uh existing vegetation<br>colors textures the national tree is<br>known as the dvdb tree<br>it's almost like a wind vane because it<br>registers the movement of the wind the<br>trade winds from the northeast<br>we catalog plant material colors we<br>catalog<br>textures and tile etc and we used these<br>to inform<br>our design which acknowledged the<br>direction of the wind and created a<br>design that was inspired<br>by garrett rietveld who is the namesake<br>of the school<br>the reef belt academy and basically<br>took that structure uh apart uh this was<br>done<br>before modernism uh retail was part of<br>the still movement<br>and the this was a revolutionary chair<br>that came into being in the 1918<br>believe it or not so it is suggested the<br>that space continued this grid continued<br>uh in the same way in my mind as the<br>wind<br>registers and continues and shapes the<br>tree<br>uh in its path so the design is oriented<br>so that the trade wind grain or the<br>direction<br>follows um the uh the<br>geometry of structures above you that<br>give you shade<br>furnishings plant material etc it's very<br>hot there<br>so these provide shade they provide<br>minimal resistance to the winds<br>and they take the colors and the<br>textures both for the ground<br>tile and for the overhead structure and<br>it creates a destination that i<br>understand now i have to get pictures of<br>it but i understand that they do tango<br>lessons<br>uh in the park which is uh a designer's<br>dream<br>uh i i needed that on my bucket list<br>tango lessons in the park and i think<br>we accomplished that at night they are<br>illuminated almost like a lantern so<br>it's active<br>during day and night um and<br>uh and it has really transformed what<br>used to be the clifford's parking lot<br>uh one last slide on this is how<br>it relates to the urban improvements we<br>situated this trellis<br>in line with the last trolley stop so by<br>doing that we connect the improvements<br>the capital improvements of<br>transportation<br>to this new capital improvement of a<br>public space and it makes these two<br>things complement each other<br>uh very well that's a school behind here<br>and some of the kids in their class um<br>i'd like to end with a project that<br>is near and dear to my heart's a<br>research project that we've worked on<br>for many years<br>um and it kind of appeals to this draw<br>that we have to the natural environment<br>especially in my mind<br>this allure of the tropics and the<br>subtropics where as<br>a chair of the program at florida<br>international university and faculty<br>we specialize in um and this romanticism<br>this wildness that is also has an<br>incredible magnetism is something that<br>was difficult to convey except through<br>centuries ago so plants and animals and<br>things in this quote-unquote new world<br>couldn't be<br>transported they didn't make their way<br>very well back but they could be<br>illustrated they could be<br>shown in paintings and illustrations and<br>drawings and in my mind they<br>capture the imagination in ways that<br>prove the power of art<br>as this kind of seminal seminal<br>uh force to change uh trajectories<br>investments etc<br>nobody saw this more than one of my uh<br>idols here alexander von humboldt<br>whom you might know this is a guy who<br>was before darwin<br>he was out in the andes and the<br>himalayas if you want to read some<br>amazing amazing<br>narratives uh take a look at any of his<br>writings<br>he took the ecotones of the himalayas<br>and the andes studied how they changed<br>according to their location from from<br>sea level<br>he documented when water boiled uh<br>you know all along here but he did that<br>in an extremely<br>powerfully artful way where it wasn't<br>just raw science but it was<br>art as well so that is<br>uh one of my hopes and and dreams for<br>the<br>ecological atlas is to take the idea<br>that we have this immense need<br>given the encroachment on urban area of<br>urban areas into the natural environment<br>these are all the roads of the world<br>this is this subtropical band<br>where i focus for many years which has<br>currently three billion people living<br>and that's projected to be 6 billion by<br>2100<br>6 out of 10 billion in the world so this<br>is a zone<br>that requires our best thinking um<br>and so the ecological atlas begins here<br>and a lot of our work has to do with<br>understanding what is normally a very um<br>off-putting and confusing uh you know<br>knowledge about the natural world most<br>people will look at<br>a forest and have difficulty<br>understanding um<br>i'll resist uh the the pun<br>it's very difficult to know what's going<br>on<br>and so what if if we look at this as an<br>opportunity to catalog the data<br>we could take any one of these species<br>organize it like we have here for<br>example this is a typical south florida<br>palette<br>create a visual calendar that shows<br>in one glance when things are in bloom<br>when they are<br>deciduous etc and then you can kind of<br>go backward<br>and take any one of those species and<br>drill down<br>digitally because again if it's looked<br>at as data we can then understand it<br>uh in terms of all this metadata how<br>salt tolerant is it how olfactory<br>is it how where does it come from we can<br>craft these stories for every single one<br>of these species<br>to get a full understanding of that<br>ecosystem<br>and so that's something that we can do<br>and we can establish patterns we go<br>outside we see something that's blooming<br>from<br>april to august it's red it looks kind<br>of like this we<br>we know then working backward<br>where it fits into this bigger picture<br>here the calendar<br>is vertical and the the species are<br>organized alphabetically<br>however they can be organized by bloom<br>time as you see here<br>so here this early bloomers happen<br>towards the bottom left<br>lay bloomers happen towards the top<br>right you could take that same data<br>and organize it by color so that you can<br>then design a garden that blooms purple<br>and coincides with a particular time of<br>year that's special to you you can<br>then drill down and say we want it to be<br>minimum maintenance or<br>uh require minimal water etc and all it<br>is is taking data that we have<br>painstakingly<br>assembled and mined from multiple<br>databases<br>and then transform that into these<br>visual graphics<br>so these become uh this almost like a<br>dna<br>uh strand of the natural world that<br>surrounds you that shows<br>uh fruit seasons in the previous image<br>it shows butterfly patterns<br>it shows how birds migrate<br>through your zone and here you can see<br>300 and well this one is half of those<br>but we catalog 350 birds<br>we can show when they're mating we can<br>show when they're moving through the<br>region<br>we can display it as art because<br>ultimately i firmly believe<br>that to change behavior facts and<br>figures really won't do it<br>it's really appealing to the emotion to<br>this visceral connection<br>that often comes through art often comes<br>through space through place<br>through culture through people and if<br>we're able to capture that<br>uh well then we can make all kinds of<br>of changes positive changes in the<br>environment as a result<br>the data that you saw there here is<br>organized according to<br>uh communities from uplands<br>down so<br>we have taken this information and<br>connected<br>geographic location with with uh<br>temporal information<br>we've taken all the plants in south<br>florida native plants that we've<br>cataloged which<br>uh are out of all the ones we cut out<br>there's 84 we reduced it to the ones<br>that are<br>salt tolerant again thinking of storm<br>surge thinking of sea level rise<br>and we can visualize the impact of what<br>that means<br>i think abstractly people know there's<br>going to be a change environmentally<br>but the moment that you show it in these<br>visual easy to understand terms<br>again it just paints a picture that's a<br>lot clearer<br>and so here the other the other thing<br>that we have been doing is connecting<br>the species to their particular habitat<br>by mapping each of these flowers<br>to all of the butterfly uh<br>larvae for which they serve as hosts we<br>can understand the impact of this<br>particular plant uh<br>similarly as nectar plants as adults<br>butterflies this<br>other plant provides nourishment for<br>these species<br>and then we can create one comprehensive<br>uh you know image that shows all of<br>these connections<br>and then filter out for salt tolerance<br>and really see the impact of what sea<br>level rise<br>can and cannot do uh in our environment<br>and so that same data here is showing<br>uh fruit for south florida<br>uh we have adapted it for fish as well<br>showing spawning seasons and this is<br>helpful again<br>for painting a picture of when it makes<br>sense to fish<br>and not fish etc um and i will wrap up<br>with this little video that<br>foreign<br>so<br>so<br>buddy<br>oh sorry i cut it short let's see<br>well um it has a grand finale but<br>i know that i'm running a little bit<br>over on time so<br>uh let's see i don't know where we where<br>we left off but<br>perhaps i can pause there because i know<br>that<br>uh i'm more than happy<br>then to take questions but uh basically<br>you know the presentation today i wanted<br>to<br>to show how our um approach and in my<br>mind these things are all<br>very much connected um it you know<br>through the idea of installations that<br>are temporary but to try to tap<br>into some unseen reality or some insight<br>about place<br>um i think there's there's there's a lot<br>of<br>really powerful uh design concepts that<br>that uh that that particular endeavor<br>these short installations can do um and<br>at the same time that these things don't<br>exist in a vacuum and<br>with a tool like ecological atlas and<br>some of the other<br>projects that i shared um it's kind of<br>an<br>ongoing investigation it doesn't you<br>know there's no<br>said formula but it's always about<br>asking questions in multiple<br>many different ways and ultimately that<br>leads to you know design that's informed<br>by people place<br>and ecology so thank you very much<br>thank you roberto um well i guess i'll<br>start i'll launch<br>some of the questions and answers um but<br>i just wanted to point out that i know<br>this is just scratching the surface of<br>your research and your work<br>and there's so much more behind it and i<br>think we get the the the core values of<br>um context time and scale and you have a<br>delicate balance between all those and<br>you have an explicit use of vegetation<br>performance and people<br>uh which is incredibly inspirational so<br>i guess um<br>i'm sure other people have questions but<br>i'll start off by asking how do you<br>actually bring this to the table maybe<br>when you have a client<br>so without losing any of that sort of<br>creative impetus<br>how do you bring it to the practical<br>pragmatic realities of dealing with<br>clients expectations and delivery of you<br>know these designs and<br>it's a very practical question um yeah<br>we can start there<br>it's very very important i think uh i<br>mean<br>if if we didn't have that practical<br>consideration in mind<br>um you know i don't think we'd be able<br>to to sort of<br>sustain and continue doing the work that<br>we do<br>um and i think that it's important to<br>understand that<br>a lot of these investigations are many<br>of the<br>installations for example are<br>self-driven uh that body of work<br>has led to grants and has led to um<br>different um i guess projects that that<br>change that paradigm and in the way that<br>we seek projects you know<br>so establishing a body of work that<br>that that is in line with what we want<br>to do<br>has meant that a lot of the projects<br>that come to us<br>is because people understand that and<br>they're not looking<br>for us to do um other kinds of projects<br>that perhaps don't have<br>as much of an interest in you know in<br>these ideas and you know<br>and so i think that there's a lot that<br>that<br>um automatically happens when you do the<br>work<br>and when you put it out there when you<br>exhibit it and publish it and<br>share it with folks and that leads to<br>i think a smaller venn diagram where you<br>really have a sweet spot where<br>the projects that you do and the people<br>who seek you have<br>know basically what the expectations are<br>so i think that<br>that helps quite a bit um and a lot of<br>the work that we have been doing<br>for many years now are referred from one<br>client to the other so<br>from that sense it's um it's kind of<br>like a<br>self-energizing cool thank you<br>um please if anybody else has questions<br>please just go ahead and unmute yourself<br>i believe<br>well whilst people still warm up with<br>your question<br>um roberto thank you for that i think<br>was absolutely mesmerizing and inspiring<br>um i think my question is related more<br>to the discipline into the profession at<br>large<br>what do you think that are the current<br>challenges that the profession will be<br>facing<br>especially now in light of the coveted<br>19 situation<br>um what are your thoughts on that<br>um well you know some things have<br>changed dramatically and some things<br>have<br>have and should they uh i think<br>you know consistent with sensitive and<br>smart and intelligent design um i think<br>that<br>the idea that we can just design in a<br>vacuum<br>that we can go to school and learn best<br>practices<br>in whatever that means and wherever you<br>are and just apply them<br>globally uh without a<br>certain humility about<br>how to approach the work i think that<br>that's something that<br>hopefully people are starting to<br>understand and learn um it's really<br>essential that you<br>have a ground level understanding a<br>conversation a dialogue multiple<br>uh to really rethink and question those<br>the assumptions that you go<br>go in with and i think that again goes<br>to<br>um this idea of being humble as a<br>designer<br>and listening and um as well as being<br>you know ambitious and courageous with<br>your ideas so that you're not<br>simply uh reinforcing the status quo so<br>i think that that is something that has<br>to remain<br>and the best ideas and the best projects<br>managed to do that<br>well the uh you know<br>the ones that that fail are the ones<br>that kind of overlook some obvious<br>things<br>how we have to change clearly uh i think<br>even though the seismic shift<br>specifically in education<br>and having to work remotely how this has<br>impacted our day-to-day operation i<br>think we're more equipped<br>than we have ever been to work remotely<br>to collaborate remotely<br>to share work remotely um and so<br>in in our experience at florida<br>international<br>um i was chatting with brandon about<br>this i mean and i'm sure<br>it's true uh for you as well uh<br>victoria uh you know we had no choice we<br>had to adapt<br>we um had 24 hours to to go<br>remotely and that was shocking uh<br>to have to do but by and large i think<br>i don't know the nature i think is<br>specifically for landscape architects<br>landscape architecture students uh<br>students faculty i think everybody was a<br>really good sport<br>about it and we're willing to experiment<br>and and do all that<br>uh i think uh from my practice i i<br>you know i have a small team but we<br>collaborate i have one of one of my<br>um uh folks works<br>remotely works in venezuela actually<br>something which i'm very happy and proud<br>knowing the challenges of<br>venezuela right now and having lived in<br>venezuela as a team myself<br>so we work remotely we collaborate we<br>have all these tools that allow us to do<br>that so we have to just<br>adapt and always be looking at what's<br>next not<br>what suits us at the moment but how can<br>we be better at it<br>for the longest time i think we resisted<br>studio education and had an online<br>digital component<br>that's right yet here we are so it's<br>really about looking<br>embracing that and not just accepting it<br>but really figuring out how can<br>we we do it even better than we were<br>before i think you know just<br>my optimistic nature things and knows<br>that we can do that<br>great great answer<br>does anybody have any questions<br>there is a question on a chat group<br>would you like to read it brandon yes uh<br>roberto how did you start the cataloging<br>and who did you<br>work with to produce such a beautiful<br>and very overwhelming<br>information of natural elements<br>well you know the how did how did that<br>project the ecological atlas start<br>um actually it was trying to figure out<br>a way<br>to convey um changes<br>in the in the environment and and<br>communicate that well i mean<br>uh for the longest time i i've always<br>been really<br>uh what fascinates me and draws me to<br>and continues to draw me into landscape<br>architecture is<br>how humbling it is and a lot of that has<br>to do<br>with um just the role that time plays no<br>matter our best intentions you know we<br>have ideas of what<br>things should be but uh but like you<br>know like that<br>that stone at the beginning of the<br>oolate rock i mean that just those<br>things just take off<br>and you know the best thing you can do<br>is give<br>anticipate and allow for these things to<br>happen<br>and approximate the direction that you<br>want him to go in but it's humbling so<br>one of those things is<br>how do you how do you show you go we go<br>on and on about oh<br>the seasons and the changes in the<br>environment and it's beautiful<br>trust me it's it's going to be amazing<br>to have all these<br>species and they're going to bring all<br>these pollinators<br>but um we have to acknowledge that those<br>for a lot of people it's difficult to<br>accept or understand or<br>uh or to simply visualize these things<br>so so it was a personal<br>challenge for me to try and come up with<br>the most<br>simple intuitive way to communicate<br>this and once you start doing it i<br>started with just bloom times of native<br>flowers<br>then it becomes obvious that well you<br>can do that for any living thing<br>and then not only can you do that but<br>you can start to maximize and leverage<br>technology<br>so that you start to speak about<br>relationships and he caught which is<br>what ecology is a set of ongoing<br>relationships<br>and so that is ultimately how the<br>project has involved<br>where i am with it is is now that we<br>have all this data is<br>having a way to do that automating that<br>digitally we have some code that allows<br>us to go visual just from a spreadsheet<br>but it's really about developing uh<br>software that will automate that even<br>more and that takes time and it takes<br>funding<br>um so that's kind of where where the<br>project<br>is and we began just by collecting<br>information from databases and<br>assembling it but we began just with<br>bloom times<br>and then that evolved into different<br>organisms and continues to evolve into<br>many many different things quite a<br>all right well thank you that was a<br>great question um so i think we'll go<br>ahead and wrap up the session<br>and we want to thank you so very much<br>roberto for<br>and all right well hopefully we'll see<br>you<br>how do you say uh good goodbye uh in<br>maori<br>uh uh yoda so hello and goodbye<br>yeah it's uh like um aloha i guess you<br>could say<br>it's similar very good well it's it's<br>been a pleasure thank you so much for<br>the opportunity<br>and um i uh and if actually if you want<br>to watch the rest of the video sorry<br>that i preempted it i must have clicked<br>and apparently<br>just go to my website which is<br>myname.com<br>and i'm happy to to continue the<br>conversation<br>so thanks so much guys really appreciate<br>it thank you roberto thank you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
