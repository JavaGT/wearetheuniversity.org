Polarisation of thought and belief seems to be on the increase particularly in the online environment. Where people who think similarly move (or are pushed) towards more fixed or extreme views, it makes it harder for people to express opinions or suggest new ideas.

further ado i'd love to<br>introduce um<br>the first of our two fabulous speakers<br>that we have tonight<br>first up we have sanjana sanjana is a<br>recognized thought leader concerning<br>technology<br>media extremism online he's<br>amongst many other things he is special<br>adviser to the ict for peace foundation<br>a senior researcher at the center for<br>policy alternatives<br>um in colombo and currently reading for<br>his phd<br>at the national center for peace and<br>conflict studies<br>here in new zealand at the university of<br>otago<br>sanjana's got a great presentation for<br>us he's going to talk about the promises<br>that technology has made and perhaps how<br>the reality is a little bit different<br>and talk us through some really<br>interesting concepts authoritarian<br>amplification<br>continuous partial attention and<br>conformity as peer currency<br>and offering recommendations for us as<br>individuals<br>thoughts for what governments and<br>corporates should be doing<br>it's going to be a fantastic<br>presentation so<br>sanjana over to you thanks very much<br>kim let me just share my screen here<br>get to my presentation<br>and hopefully everybody can see that um<br>wonderful to be here with you this<br>evening um i would like to spend<br>10 minutes outlining the landscape as i<br>see it<br>around the topic that we have to discuss<br>in front of us now i have to be very<br>careful because i'm a guest in your<br>country and i know nothing<br>really of the politics that govern it<br>so it's a bit like vomiting on the pope<br>i hope i don't offend anybody<br>by what i have to say i try to steer<br>away from new zealand politics and<br>in a sense go to my comfort area of sri<br>lankan politics and group think on<br>social media<br>and how it impacts politics in a global<br>sense but also<br>around my country i think it's a<br>it's not a topic that we are going to<br>have any kind of consensus or any clear<br>answers at the end of this evening<br>and that's part of why i think it's<br>important to have this conversation<br>as i see it there are new challenges<br>that confront us as citizens<br>that haven't been around in decades<br>prior to that which we are living in the<br>slide you see up there<br>is a result of my work here in otago<br>um on the left you see<br>in a sense the discussions on twitter<br>in sri lanka and on the right you see<br>the discussions on twitter in new<br>zealand now what's interesting<br>and to many of you who are familiar with<br>space<br>this might look like something out of<br>the hubble telescope<br>looking at the far reaches of our milky<br>way<br>uh this country for example is wonderful<br>at seeing constellations and<br>this is not unlike one of those<br>constellations that you would see<br>from space what you see in front of you<br>are<br>in a sense rather traumatic moments for<br>both countries on the right hand side<br>that's a capture around three weeks<br>after the christchurch massacre<br>and on the left that's around three<br>weeks after the easter sunday terrorism<br>last year in sri lanka which killed<br>hundreds so very traumatic events and<br>what i do in my doctoral research<br>is to look at the manner in which<br>conversations at the national level<br>occur in response to reacting to<br>complementing contrasting debating<br>these kinds of traumatic events as well<br>as political developments<br>and other moments of interest<br>in in in sri lanka but you know when i<br>was here<br>doing my research i found it interesting<br>to look at christchurch<br>and by the way twitter and the<br>university of otago<br>have undertaken a research project to<br>look at how twitter<br>in new zealand reacted to the<br>christchurch massacre<br>i'm looking at data six months prior to<br>it and six months after it<br>um and that research is going to be<br>public later on in the year<br>but you know this is what i do i look at<br>the manner in which conversations on<br>social media<br>evolve and why they evolve in the way<br>that they do<br>some of you and we have an international<br>audience i don't know whether anybody is<br>from the middle east though but<br>you know just over a decade ago um there<br>was this spirit of optimism<br>naive perhaps to now take a look at it<br>but<br>it was a spirit of optimism that the<br>promise<br>of the democratization of technology of<br>social media<br>blooming and blossoming among citizenry<br>was that<br>populists and authoritarianism and<br>authoritarians<br>would be overthrown and democratic<br>institutions and and frameworks would be<br>um placed in countries which have never<br>enjoyed<br>uh democracy uh and all that comes with<br>it<br>uh for for decades so there was this<br>around expectation dividends of social<br>media<br>and the the the hope<br>that the production and the promotion<br>and the pitch<br>of this content would strengthen<br>democratic traditions<br>or strengthen entrench and expand<br>newly established democratic traditions<br>in countries as i said which had only<br>known authoritarianism<br>uh for for many decades this was if you<br>recall<br>loosely and inelegantly called the arab<br>spring moment<br>and of course now we are older better<br>and wiser this<br>backdrop is from my own country sri<br>lanka at around the time when i came for<br>my doctoral studies in march<br>2018 to cut a long story short in that<br>time<br>in that month the country saw<br>till then some of the worst communal<br>violence<br>that he had experienced for decades<br>against the muslims in us<br>you know in a city called candy and its<br>environs<br>this made the new york times top of the<br>fold<br>headlines it was it was that bad and one<br>of the reasons it did that was because<br>of the role the reach and the relevance<br>of social media<br>in inflaming the violence uh it didn't<br>create the conditions for the violence<br>to occur<br>but it it created this tsunami of<br>public opinion<br>that weaponized communal distrust over<br>decades<br>and resulted in the normalization of<br>heinous violence against the community<br>so<br>today around the world you find this<br>general hesitation<br>to grasp the early potential of<br>social media and democracy simply<br>because there's a lot of<br>bad around i don't want to get into it<br>because i think the media is full of it<br>but there's a lot of demonization<br>there's a lot of discontent particularly<br>amongst the young folk in all our<br>countries here as well as in sri lanka<br>and i think there's a lot of interest in<br>the seed the spread and the<br>the seizure of that early potential by<br>some of the worst elements in society<br>and<br>here we have the president of sri lanka<br>elected in november 2019 this man<br>genuinely frightens me i won't go into<br>too much because i think the record is<br>public<br>but in a sense i put this up as a symbol<br>of the kind of individual that you have<br>with duterte the trump with bolsonaro<br>with urban<br>across both sides of the atlantic and in<br>many other countries as well where<br>the individual founded on<br>populism and authoritarian trends and<br>frameworks supported by social media<br>rises<br>into almost absolute power so<br>academics call this bully pulpits now<br>where social media gives rise to<br>individuals like this<br>uh an easy vector of amplifying their<br>message<br>uh and you know a complete reversal from<br>a decade ago<br>where you have now authoritarians as the<br>greatest<br>engineers of populism<br>and the entrenchment of their power<br>through social media<br>and a lot of it is because a lot of<br>people think that that is the only way<br>that one can<br>think and do things i i selected these<br>two photos i actually<br>spent some time trying to pick them out<br>because you know both of them<br>decades apart are from the new york<br>subway<br>and i think that visually it's very very<br>clear how things have<br>changed you know several decades ago but<br>i suppose in the lifetime<br>of some of the people on this zoom call<br>you had public transportation there you<br>actually looked at the other person and<br>talked with them um<br>and if you didn't look at the other<br>person you were probably engrossed in a<br>newspaper<br>or you tried to have some kind of<br>conversation nobody was<br>engrossed in what you have in the other<br>photo which is a completely distinct<br>difference where everybody's engrossed<br>in their mobile phones and in their own<br>words<br>there's a researcher called linda stone<br>who called this continuous partial<br>attention<br>today to cut it short we are all the<br>time<br>right now i'm sure many of you would be<br>because we can't see you i can't see you<br>nobody can see you checking their phones<br>looking at their ipads probably checking<br>some notification that comes up<br>posting on facebook that the sri lankan<br>speaker is an idiot and doesn't know<br>what he's talking about<br>um and so we are always multitasking and<br>you know it's a real<br>challenge it's there's a there's a<br>psychosocial part to this<br>um but you know one of the things that<br>it you know hooks it to our topic today<br>is that we are gripped by information<br>that doesn't<br>inform us really and we mistake<br>all the time virality i.e popularity<br>for veracity i.e truth and this is a<br>real challenge it's a challenge in new<br>zealand<br>it's more of a challenge actually in sri<br>lanka<br>and that's when we come to group think<br>and for me<br>uh and i think that we can talk about<br>group things later on there's a real<br>cost of speaking out today and it's<br>comfortable<br>just fitting in and being silent and<br>then going with the flow going with the<br>herd as it were<br>and many young people i've spoken to um<br>seem to tell me that<br>it's it's more challenging to speak up<br>speak out<br>than it is to even in in peer groups by<br>the way than it is to kind of just let<br>go with the flow<br>um and then just let things happen and<br>evolve<br>and that's why i called it peer currency<br>conformity<br>is fear currency here in dunedin for<br>example all the young undergrads seem to<br>wear the same kind of genes<br>the same kind of outfit um and it's it's<br>the<br>sameness there is no dare to be<br>different attitude<br>and in a sense that can be a metaphor<br>for our public conversation as well<br>there are real costs in sri lanka around<br>speaking out and speaking up<br>but there seems to be the same kind of<br>medicines and hesitation here in new<br>zealand as well<br>so what can be done i don't want to take<br>josie's time and she has some fantastic<br>slides i think that will<br>follow up after me and i peg it to three<br>levels the individual the state<br>and the corporate i.e the silicon valley<br>moguls who handle our platforms<br>as an individual as citizens i think<br>this is a real hard conversation we have<br>in sri lanka because sri lanka has a<br>country of voters we<br>we have a very loose embryonic uh sense<br>of citizenship but<br>i think broadly speaking as citizens as<br>individuals in a democracy as<br>individuals in a country<br>um it would behoove us to be intentional<br>in what we consume to be critical in<br>questioning what we consume and i always<br>say you know consume<br>widely be liberal in our consumption but<br>conservative in your engagement<br>conservative not in the political sense<br>but be reflective being<br>thoughtful around what one consumes<br>so it's eating a lot but then as time<br>goes by<br>selecting actually what you like to eat<br>and what you like to consume<br>and then in terms of you know<br>consumption also have set<br>times don't fall prey to the<br>notification<br>um hostage situation which we all you<br>know i am<br>actually quite guilty of all the time<br>because the damn things keep popping up<br>and you are distracted<br>all the time and it really taxes your<br>mind<br>at the state level or the government<br>level i think that i think new zealand's<br>got a handle on this sri lanka does not<br>um the importance of education in the<br>main<br>and civic and media literacy in<br>particular<br>and i know this can't be stressed enough<br>and<br>it goes back to the point i made earlier<br>around this confusion around information<br>uh and popularity being conflated with<br>truth and veracity and i think again new<br>zealand<br>is is rather good i mean this current<br>campaign about hearing racism<br>by the new zealand human rights<br>commission it's about confronting<br>that which is an inconvenient truth<br>grappling with it and talking about it<br>as opposed to<br>shunning it sri lanka does not do that<br>and one of the things is that we don't<br>have a common narrative we don't<br>have something that binds us together as<br>a society<br>and one of the things that social media<br>does is that it splinters<br>everybody and all the groups into the<br>present the past and the future that<br>they believe<br>is true but there is no glue that binds<br>the country together<br>in a common shared narrative and that's<br>a problem and that i think has to start<br>with education and finally<br>the likes of facebook twitter and google<br>i don't want to get too technical please<br>ask me questions<br>if you so feel moved to do so<br>but there's a lot that silicon valley<br>and these<br>and i use the word consciously horrible<br>social media companies can do to make<br>their products<br>better from a do no harm perspective<br>through to<br>engineering there's things that<br>individuals can do<br>but at scale there are things that only<br>the social media companies can do<br>and the technical word that some of uh<br>us use is echo chambers<br>to get us out of that which we believe<br>in and we hold true and we think<br>is true to kind of confront us with<br>that which makes us slightly<br>uncomfortable but forces us to ask<br>questions around<br>our reality and what we believe and hold<br>to be true<br>and there are things that these<br>companies can do in a progressive way<br>in a democracy um to kind of<br>uh introduce us to those things so those<br>are the so<br>those are some of the thoughts i want to<br>leave you with and i look forward<br>to the discussion that we'll have after<br>josie's presentation thank you<br>and thank you so much uh sanjana i can<br>confirm that i was not distracted by any<br>notifications during your presentation<br>you had my whole<br>attention next up it's uh my pleasure to<br>introduce josie<br>josie is the director of the council for<br>international development<br>she has got a stellar background in<br>communications and public affairs<br>having supported new zealand's prime<br>minister and a number of<br>international organizations and ngos<br>tonight jose is going to talk to us<br>about why politics have become<br>so polarized and how this is playing out<br>in social media and in what we call the<br>non-virtual world<br>we're going to hear about tribal voting<br>patterns<br>how to protect democracy and how this is<br>all likely to play out in the upcoming<br>new zealand and u.s<br>elections so josie this all sounds great<br>over to you yeah i hope i can deliver on<br>the promise of that introduction thanks<br>kim<br>i'm just going to share my screen uh<br>and make sure i get into the presenter<br>mode um<br>looking all right you can see that now<br>yep<br>um so yes i'm sort of wearing two hats<br>uh uh today and um sanjana that was a<br>fantastic presentation i'm trying to<br>find ways to link it all because<br>i'm gonna talk more about i suppose the<br>the the real world of politics uh<br>and how it impacts i think on on all our<br>communication platforms<br>across social media um and<br>i thought i'd start because yeah i mean<br>i work as you know in in<br>aid agencies as kim said i i run an<br>umbrella organization for the aid<br>agencies but i also do political<br>commentary and i see on the<br>there's a lot of participants friends<br>and colleagues from both worlds so<br>i'm going to try and sort of unite those<br>and i think the thing that unites<br>aid and development is of course<br>politics it's all political<br>and we're seeing the same sort of trends<br>play out made in development so<br>um starting off with a story really of a<br>colleague of mine<br>who will be familiar to you max rashbook<br>and we were talking a while ago about<br>citizens assemblies and he was trying to<br>convince me that these are really good<br>ideas and i was like<br>i'm not sure you know we've got<br>parliament um but we were agreeing that<br>it's extremely important<br>uh for democracy and to push back on<br>some of this group think<br>polarization that we have diverse voices<br>and<br>they're represented and that too many<br>groups in society feel excluded<br>they feel marginalized and and<br>vulnerable and they and therefore<br>they become silenced and that's really<br>dangerous and we were nodding furiously<br>agreeing with each other and then<br>suddenly i said hold on max<br>you're talking about identity i'm<br>talking about working class new<br>zealanders<br>so it's a kind of moment of revelation<br>for us that we realized we were talking<br>about completely different groups<br>but you know i would argue if you look<br>at at our<br>our parliament representation of<br>parliament at our um<br>media um even in our social media and<br>creative new zealand and what content<br>gets funded that we're doing pretty well<br>on diversity in new zealand and<br>inclusiveness and that's a really good<br>thing<br>but i think the voice that's missing is<br>an authentic working-class<br>voice and i think often that's they're<br>excluded that voice is excluded from<br>our mainstream politics and our media in<br>fact we don't even talk about the<br>working class we talk about low-income<br>people um so i suppose my<br>my my mantra or my kind of guiding<br>principle is that exclusion<br>is always dangerous in a democracy and<br>it does lead to the sorts of<br>trends that sanjana was talking about<br>elites are never good<br>on the right or the left and making<br>politics<br>a religion where heretics are punished<br>and<br>uh and you shield yourself i suppose<br>from opposing views<br>doesn't make those opposing views go<br>away or bad ideas go away<br>and what it does is it drives it<br>underground so<br>i know looking globally that you know<br>the oldest and vastest exclusion that<br>we've seen<br>has been of course the exclusion of<br>people of color<br>and and i'm quoting david brooks from<br>the new york times here where he said<br>exclusion from the commanding<br>institutions of culture<br>which of course now is very much uh<br>social media too and<br>you know if you look at uh recent events<br>in the u.s uh<br>it that kind of polarization is shocking<br>to us<br>and and i'd have to say we you know we<br>don't see that in new zealand and i hope<br>we never do<br>and i and partly i think because parties<br>of the right<br>have not played that kind of politics<br>they haven't turned<br>our treaty process for example into um<br>something that polarized the nation<br>they've got behind it and so<br>i don't think we're in a situation in<br>new zealand where we're facing these<br>kinds of polarizations but<br>we are in what i would call an<br>unacknowledged culture war<br>and i think that's the bigger threat for<br>us and you see it playing out in social<br>media you see it playing out in the real<br>world<br>so of course we know what real<br>polarization looks like this is new i<br>mean america feels virtually<br>ungovernable<br>now um and just to take some of the<br>some of the examples that sanjana was<br>using and add to them i mean<br>this was iran just a few months ago when<br>covert was hitting<br>uh this is a couple of weeks ago in<br>eastern russia<br>a protest against putin brave to do that<br>and of course if you look at um uh<br>uh what polarization really used to look<br>like<br>uh if we go back to the the rise of<br>fascism<br>in in europe i mean it really was if you<br>look at what was happening in the 1930s<br>you were seeing the beginnings of uh<br>disintegration of<br>of communities and an acceleration<br>group think if you like where<br>politically suspect<br>civil servants are being fired where um<br>cultural and scientific cleansings were<br>being carried out<br>and everything ungerman had to disappear<br>books<br>and so on so if that was happening now<br>you know we would be<br>uh that the kind of censorship would be<br>happening all through social media as we<br>see in in places like china at the<br>moment<br>but i suppose i would argue not wanting<br>to make any comparisons with nazi<br>germany but that<br>an intellectual segregation on the left<br>has been bad too<br>and sanjana talked about conformism and<br>i think there's a danger<br>that as progressives we've become quite<br>insular<br>we've become quite conformist we tend to<br>protect ourselves from heretics and<br>and often we get blindsided by reality<br>uh if i go back here you know in the us<br>no one expected trump to win<br>and he did win we weren't paying<br>attention something was happening and we<br>didn't see it happening and i think<br>that's the danger<br>if if if you are sitting in your own<br>group<br>and not really realizing what's<br>happening under the surface<br>and i would say you know trump won and<br>he didn't win<br>because of social media and facebook and<br>and russian<br>funding uh of facebook um<br>if we think that we're missing the very<br>real appeal<br>of the populists so<br>um this is back in 2017<br>where there was a big movement i think<br>to ban mike hosking off the air<br>and and while um you know many of us<br>might disagree with his political views<br>the idea that you<br>that you ban ideas that you disagree<br>with<br>isn't actually going to get rid of those<br>bad ideas and<br>we talk a lot about cancer culture i<br>know but the point is it doesn't make<br>the bad ideas go away<br>it makes them go underground and when<br>they go underground people whole groups<br>get<br>feel silenced even if they're not being<br>silenced<br>and i think if you go back to um if you<br>look at the<br>birth of the labour party for example in<br>the uk<br>what's really interesting is it really<br>did emerge because politics was<br>dominated by just<br>some groups certain groups wigs the<br>tories the liberals<br>there was no voice for for uh working<br>class people<br>and you know in those days you joined<br>the labour party<br>if you were care hardy and a minor you<br>joined the labour party to make<br>your life better off today of course we<br>often join the labour party to make<br>somebody else's life better off<br>now that's not a bad thing in itself<br>it's a good thing<br>but it has transformed politics of the<br>left and it has potentially<br>a working-class voice now my colleague<br>in the uk who may be familiar to some of<br>you deb mattison<br>she runs a think tank called britain<br>thinks<br>she sums up this change really well uh<br>you know<br>20 years ago quite recently if you<br>talked about the labor party<br>an image people would come up with an<br>image of you know a pint and a pie in<br>the pub<br>that was the labor party today it's a<br>bowl of quinoa in a wine bar<br>so there's been a transformation of our<br>politics<br>our progressive politics on the left and<br>to put that another way<br>thomas piketty who of course you all<br>know<br>uh charted it the change here so you go<br>back to the 1950s<br>where the the most people who voted<br>on the left would have had very little<br>education and would be predominantly<br>working class<br>voices and then you cut through uh<br>back to to today and it's predominantly<br>people who are highly educated even with<br>phds<br>now you know um again you know that's<br>not a bad thing<br>but the problem is you do end up with i<br>suppose a reversal<br>of of um who is who's in who's in<br>leadership<br>roles on the in the left on political<br>parties and<br>um you can have a a a disjunct i suppose<br>a disjointed<br>a disconnection between the people<br>you're meant to be representing and the<br>people<br>who are actually leading and it can then<br>emerge this kind of sneering if you like<br>of<br>of um the views of people you don't<br>agree with<br>uh you know the food they eat the cars<br>they drive<br>um the content the the the tv they watch<br>um and i'll talk a little bit more about<br>that<br>um in a minute but i think uh you know<br>thomas picketty talked about the brahmin<br>left this sort of sense of<br>a of a priesthood a high priesthood that<br>um is is you know it feels a need to<br>instruct people on how to live their<br>lives so that immediately is an<br>alienating thing<br>this is a um a quote from paul collier's<br>book<br>uh the the i think it's called the<br>future of capitalism but he talks about<br>six core values that drive all voters<br>loyalty fairness liberty hierarchy<br>care and sanctity and if you think about<br>it<br>parties on the left do very well with<br>fairness parties on the right<br>do very well with liberty but the<br>winning combination this is what's<br>really interesting because a winning<br>combination if you think back to jacinda<br>in 2017 in labor<br>or even john key in 2007 is a broad<br>church uh appeal to lots of different<br>groups<br>in society and and has and triggers many<br>of those qualities not just<br>one or two of them going back to dad<br>madison again in the uk<br>she she tried to sort of analyze this as<br>three core groups in society<br>that if you want to win elections if you<br>want to have successful politics<br>you need to appeal to all three the<br>first is settlers<br>traditional working class second she<br>calls prospectors<br>an aspirational uh middle class and<br>lower middle class<br>and the third one is pioneers<br>progressives social liberals<br>and the winning combination uh appeals<br>to all of those<br>but she argues that what's happened is<br>that the pioneers are now running<br>parties on the left and that means<br>they've become a lot less tolerant<br>of the views of the settlers or even the<br>prospectors<br>and and that's where you get a shift<br>you know rather than disagreeing with<br>other people's views you start<br>disapproving of them<br>and then you start to really metastasize<br>this group think<br>and it's interesting to look at what is<br>it that the the populists and and<br>sanjana talked about you know listed a<br>whole heap of them<br>you know what is it that is the appeal<br>of the populists and partly<br>you know partly it's optimism i mean<br>that there is no<br>more optimistic political slogan in<br>recent times than make america great<br>again<br>uh it's also about belonging and a sense<br>that you know if you feel you haven't<br>got a voice suddenly you<br>you have got a voice if you're being<br>sneered out suddenly you feel confident<br>you know so<br>we've got to be really aware of the<br>appeal of the populace and think well<br>how can we be more<br>more optimistic and how can we offer<br>more hope<br>um in new zealand i mean this is just a<br>quick summary of what it what<br>what those uh categories look like here<br>in new zealand<br>uh you know we've got a working class<br>job of aspirational middle lower middle<br>class family<br>and of course um jacinda who personifies<br>a sort of progressive<br>uh left and even the even the um<br>friselle<br>image there is very much signaling a<br>belonging to a certain progressive group<br>um i think the<br>the the answer to this is how do we<br>avoid<br>getting into that polarization that you<br>see in the us<br>and elsewhere and across europe is<br>you've got to listen to all of those<br>different groups<br>and this is a poll that came out i think<br>not that long ago about a month ago<br>about what are the issues that are<br>driving new zealanders right now into<br>this election<br>and right up the top there is economy<br>housing<br>jobs uh healthcare interesting and this<br>is not my own you know<br>not putting my own personal views out<br>away from this but you look down there<br>climate change is quite far down<br>uh immigration is quite far down so<br>part of what we've got to do is be<br>prepared to really listen to the things<br>that are driving people<br>in their everyday lives and that will be<br>the same as aiden development<br>too we know in the pacific every single<br>pacific country<br>even those most affected by climate<br>change the top three issues for people<br>living in those countries<br>jobs health and education so climate<br>change is there<br>but those are the things that people are<br>really focused on<br>and this is the uh famous edelman um<br>barometer the trust barometer and what i<br>find interesting this is<br>the most recent one uh from about<br>february i think<br>what's interesting about this is that<br>you can see income inequality<br>is the greatest influence on a decline<br>in trust<br>in governments and institutions and<br>institutions is you know<br>mainstream media and so on so inequality<br>drives the kind of divisions and<br>polarizations that we're that we're<br>seeing overseas and it's something that<br>that we know from our polling here<br>people want governments to address<br>um so<br>this is uh actually i'll i'll go to this<br>slide now because<br>um as colleagues of mine in this<br>in this think tank called more in common<br>have uh and<br>and more in common was the think tank<br>that started in england<br>after um an mp was<br>murdered there during some of the<br>nastiest brexit<br>uh um uh sort of tensions<br>and her legacy uh<br>emerged into her friends and colleagues<br>setting up this think tank called more<br>in common and the whole drive was to<br>find<br>the things that unite us rather than<br>divide us and what's interesting about<br>this they looked at tribal<br>uh these values how do how are people<br>fitting themselves into tribes these<br>days rather than<br>political allegiances to say the labour<br>party or the you know national party or<br>democrats or republicans<br>and so on tories labor and if you<br>just looked at the us for example and<br>i'm sure it would be pretty<br>we could do similar thing in new zealand<br>you know pretty much 50 50.<br>50 people think 50 think immigration is<br>good<br>50 not so good same with feminism same<br>with<br>gender and sexuality race and so on now<br>if you dig down into the tribes<br>what you get is progressive activists<br>absolutely nearly 100<br>think that immigration for example just<br>taking immigration as an example<br>is a positive um devoted conservatives<br>right at the other end of the spectrum<br>nearly 100 think it's a bad thing<br>it's you can see how the tribes you know<br>what you think about<br>parenting whether you think creativity<br>is more important than discipline<br>you know whether you drive an electric<br>car or a petrol car<br>um all of these uh values<br>and and um uh tastes are driving our<br>politics now<br>and so you know if you're a um a<br>progressive activist you're gonna think<br>that that immigration is good and so on<br>but the but the good news about this i<br>suppose is that in the middle and they<br>call it this exhausted middle<br>are most people so most people are sick<br>of the hate speech<br>they're also sick of what they call not<br>my words but political correctness<br>so that tells you that in the middle<br>you've actually got a lot of people<br>who feel really good about social<br>liberalism actually<br>um that they're positive about you know<br>same-sex marriage<br>um it's only really on the fringes that<br>you're getting this kind of<br>disintegration<br>and so i suppose our challenge really is<br>to look at how we talk to that<br>exhaustive middle and again it comes<br>back to<br>you know giving people a sense of<br>optimism a sense of<br>hope um owning the future in a way that<br>the populists have been doing extremely<br>successfully<br>consciously reaching out to different<br>communities that<br>that are not like you um and and<br>listening not sneering and that kind of<br>sense of authentic leadership<br>where you have people talking from a<br>real place not feeling like they're<br>political<br>um sort of professionals<br>um and and the really good news when<br>we're looking at what unites us rather<br>than divides us is i think this<br>where um and this is a some yougov<br>polling that was done last year maybe a<br>bit longer than that but<br>on the whole most people whether you're<br>working class blue collar worker or<br>you're<br>way up there at the other end of the<br>spectrum in the lgbtqi<br>um group uh whether you're<br>ethnic minority middle class woman or so<br>just about everybody<br>wants to see something done about<br>inequality<br>and they support redistribution of<br>wealth so that tells me that if you deal<br>with<br>inequality wherever you see it if you if<br>you<br>reach out across your groups and if you<br>celebrate the values and the culture of<br>different groups<br>including working class new zealanders<br>then actually we're going to have the<br>best possible approach to dealing with<br>any emergence of polarization in new<br>zealand<br>so yeah there's a lot to be hopeful<br>about<br>thank you thank you so much josie<br>um just for those those starting<br>thoughts on<br>how we can avoid that polarization um<br>now now we're at q a time and we can see<br>there's a few questions coming in<br>in the in the q a questions and comments<br>there<br>as emc i i get first dibs on<br>asking a couple of questions of our<br>fabulous um<br>panelists so um i'll be with me as i do<br>that and then i'll get to what we have<br>in the in the q<br>a um sunshine if i could start with<br>you with a little question um that i<br>have um<br>you may be aware um as part of the new<br>zealand government's<br>response to the christchurch terror<br>attacks<br>it indicated it was going to make a<br>number of changes to domestic law and<br>policy<br>and in particular to have a look at the<br>laws that regulate media<br>um in particular how they cover social<br>media<br>and so my question to you is you know if<br>you got to decide what the terms of<br>reference<br>for that government review was you know<br>what do you think should be<br>in scope this is the<br>question that gets my visa revoked<br>and a very quick deportation um no but<br>you know<br>i think that well listen i think there<br>are policy experts<br>here in the audience who know about this<br>much more than i do i have two broad<br>um answers if it um<br>if it can be seen in that manner one is<br>that it<br>matters what new zealand does to more<br>than new zealand and that might be<br>somewhat confusing<br>to those here um and i say this because<br>a lot of<br>other countries look at new zealand<br>australia<br>singapore the united states the united<br>kingdom europe<br>and then you know try to bring about<br>domestic legislation<br>that echoes what they say have been done<br>in those countries and that's<br>sometimes a problem australia after<br>christchurch<br>singapore malaysia indonesia<br>the current conversations around section<br>230 in the united states as a<br>consequence of what trump is trying to<br>do<br>these are slightly technical but they<br>all suggest that<br>for domestic reasons when these<br>governments that are<br>seen as by countries like mine<br>to be the beacons of democracy they<br>bring about legislation and regulatory<br>frameworks<br>that really impinge around the freedom<br>of expression that becomes then an<br>excuse<br>for authoritarians to say ah look down<br>look they did that<br>so we are going to do the same and of<br>course the veneer<br>is that the the polish is that you know<br>we are doing this to protect citizenry<br>but really it's a chilling effect and so<br>it matters that new zealand gets this<br>right it's something that<br>um if i may just stress and urge it's<br>not something that local policy makers<br>often think about<br>and arguably do need to think about but<br>it does matter<br>uh for the rest of the world that that<br>this is done right and follows the<br>wide global recognition and acceptance<br>of the christchurch call<br>and the parameters that the call was<br>around um that you can build on as as<br>well<br>and listen again david k the just<br>retired uh special rapporteur of the<br>united nations<br>for freedom of expression two years ago<br>came out with a document<br>that was tabled at the at the sessions<br>that built on the manila principles of<br>intermediary content regulation in 2014<br>uh and then towards the end of the<br>document had two sets of recommendations<br>one for social media companies<br>and another for government it's really<br>very simple there are a couple of things<br>that i think new zealand can<br>can can very easily adopt and adapt um<br>one is that the regulations need to be<br>based on judicial independence and not<br>government authorities<br>it needs to have a a legal of framework<br>and none of the whims and fancies of a<br>political party or what might be a very<br>popular government<br>there needs to be transparency and<br>accountability<br>for example with content take downs it<br>needs to be extremely restricted<br>governed by rules overarchingly governed<br>by the principle of the freedom of<br>expression and human rights<br>uh protection uh and it has to be very<br>very clearly circumscribed<br>because otherwise overreach very quickly<br>leads to a chilling effect as well even<br>in mature democracies<br>uh it should be standards based and i<br>think that<br>one of the things that is in the<br>recommendation is that states should<br>have some<br>sort of a transparency report a<br>scorecard a report card<br>and that if this kind of regulation and<br>legislation and regulatory framework is<br>embarked upon that there needs to be a<br>public conversation<br>yearly annually if possible with<br>citizens around what the government did<br>and why and so there is review<br>and discussion around the regulation as<br>well so it's not just set in stone<br>and that's really important because<br>that's what<br>authoritarians don't like they like to<br>propose and push<br>and promote something um with a<br>paternalistic kind of<br>bent suggesting that this is good and<br>you know obviously they don't want any<br>kind of discussion around that ever<br>after<br>so these are broad principles i know<br>that the evening is already late and it<br>gets really technical very very quickly<br>but for those who are interested this is<br>a public document the manila principles<br>are a public document<br>david k has written more and also social<br>media companies have also come a long<br>way in a few years<br>that are they are rather supportive now<br>of regulatory frameworks<br>those juries out on that i mean what<br>they call regulation what we would like<br>as regulation are two different things<br>but i but i would like to end by urging<br>you to think of<br>um you know a progressive way<br>forward that helps countries like mine<br>also construct frameworks along these<br>lines it's really important that new<br>zealand gets this right<br>and i don't want to name names but<br>countries neighboring new zealand<br>haven't got it right and david k has<br>written about this<br>and we really shouldn't go down that<br>path<br>thank you very much uh son jonathan i<br>think we can pass on those comments to<br>the government departments doing this<br>review<br>um josie um a question for you i was<br>really keen to sort of tap<br>into your your journalistic background a<br>little bit as well<br>you know as we as we come into the<br>general election um<br>you know the threat of misinformation is<br>just as a real<br>issue isn't it for us um when we're<br>trying to decide<br>to look at policies of of the candidates<br>and and whatnot<br>you know where do you think new<br>zealanders should be going for their<br>information<br>and the lead up to this election and are<br>there special roles for mainstream media<br>in this<br>or not um yes<br>to you know quick answer yes absolutely<br>there are roles<br>for for mainstream media because you've<br>still got a lot of people who will be<br>accessing information<br>via mainstream media um<br>yeah i mean i i really admire the policy<br>that the greens have of<br>having their policies costed of uh um<br>you know really deep detailed uh<br>analysis of what that who's gonna pay<br>you know the two the two questions like<br>you know what are you actually gonna do<br>and who's and what's the detail of it<br>and<br>granularity of it and who's going to pay<br>and i think what we're seeing in the<br>election is a slightly dangerous<br>um strand of um<br>you know and perhaps this is a criticism<br>of the government actually of the labor<br>government of thinking well we won't put<br>any policy out there<br>uh we'll we'll we'll carry on governing<br>and everybody else can put policy out<br>there well actually<br>you know you you do have to and i take<br>my hat off to both the greens and the<br>act parties the both sides of politics<br>where<br>they are putting out very detailed<br>granular<br>um policy that they're analyzing how<br>it's going to be costed<br>and they're coming up with sort of you<br>know edgy stuff that you can disagree<br>with<br>um whether it's a universal benefit or<br>whether it's a um<br>an insurance scheme instead of an<br>unemployment scheme so<br>i think i think there are two things<br>about that kim because<br>there was a big you know trump got away<br>with calling<br>mainstream media fake news and anything<br>he doesn't like fake news<br>because whole groups of people and<br>communities in america felt like they<br>weren't represented in that mainstream<br>media you know<br>um and so therefore you know it's a<br>chicken and egg thing<br>like yes we need to make sure that that<br>there is<br>uh information that can be relied on and<br>that is not<br>um you know manipulated in any way but<br>we also need to be aware that<br>uh you know people can only get away<br>with with<br>uh accusing someone of fake news if<br>we're not actually getting out there and<br>putting stuff that people really want to<br>listen to you know<br>so it's yes educate but actually listen<br>you know i actually listen to what<br>people are telling you their problem is<br>and then answer that and then they'll<br>listen you know<br>last thing i'll say about it is uh we<br>you know we always complain that no one<br>votes in local elections no one votes<br>for dhbs because we never know who the<br>candidates<br>are that you try closing a hospital in a<br>local community<br>and people will come out and vote for<br>their dh who's on their dhb<br>so you know the onus is on us<br>as much as it is on those who are<br>manipulating for<br>for the worst possible reasons the<br>anxieties and angers of people who don't<br>feel represented<br>thanks very much josie for that answer<br>we're going to kick into the the list of<br>q a<br>just a little reminder if you've got<br>questions to pop them in the q a<br>not into the chat i mean we might try<br>and catch them if they're in there but<br>it's easier if they're on the q a folks<br>i'm going to start with the most upvoted<br>questions first up a question<br>from howard whitten who's really<br>interested<br>in the possibilities of using protected<br>whistleblowing<br>as a driver for transparency<br>accountability<br>and integrity and business um and it's<br>sort of a view that actually<br>if we could change the perception of<br>having more principled whistle blowing<br>um would this make a difference so would<br>one of the panel<br>like to to comment on this<br>whistle-blowing question<br>josie want to take a crack at that<br>because i have a i have a i have an<br>answer but i think i'll follow you okay<br>well let me say something very quickly i<br>totally agree howard and i think um<br>uh you know whistleblowing in in any<br>democracy<br>has and when it works well has been and<br>is<br>one of the best accountability<br>mechanisms we've got<br>so um yeah i mean we do have<br>whistleblowing legislation of course but<br>um you're absolutely right that it it<br>could be it could be<br>um you know protected whistleblowing is<br>certainly something that i think we<br>should look at but sanjana you've got<br>something i i completely agree with the<br>both of you my my concern<br>not hesitation my my appeal to think<br>about whistleblowing in 2020<br>is the implications of the information<br>age<br>we live in um it is no longer the case<br>that<br>anonymity and pseudonymity guarantees or<br>can be guaranteed<br>and if you do end up becoming a<br>whistleblower you don't have to go down<br>the edward snowden route in a purely<br>domestic sense<br>depending on what you are revealing to<br>the public uh the perspective might give<br>you a way the manner in which you do it<br>might give you a way the minute which<br>you engage might give you away<br>and there are dozen if not more uh<br>hundreds of data trails and digital<br>trailers that make<br>blowing very very difficult i think it's<br>a fantastic question i have nothing<br>against whistle blowing<br>but it comes with attendant risks and<br>challenges<br>that weren't there a few years ago and<br>that has to be really<br>taken on board when and when and if<br>you're going to do it<br>and sanjana i'll just add to that<br>because i think you're absolutely right<br>and<br>the the principle of whistle blowing<br>doesn't necessarily mean that the<br>content of the whistleblowing needs to<br>be made public but just need that there<br>needs to be the mechanisms to<br>have that properly addressed so that you<br>can<br>sometimes protect any people who may<br>well be<br>damaged in the in in that information<br>going public<br>yeah thanks very much to both of you<br>and my next question is going to be a<br>little bit of a mashup<br>of a few questions that we have on the<br>screen and it's about<br>diversity and so um<br>ann ball sort of kicked us off with this<br>question how can sort of diverse<br>individuals and groups be heard in new<br>zealand<br>how can they be included rather than<br>excluded<br>um and sort of building on that um<br>comments and questions from brian wilden<br>and kay<br>jones you know where's the maori<br>perspective in this<br>chinese pacific we've got very diverse<br>communities<br>in new zealand um would the speakers<br>yeah maybe i'll just say something<br>quickly about that because uh when when<br>i'm<br>you know it's funny when i even hear<br>myself say working-class new zealanders<br>i can feel people going oh<br>you know we don't that we don't have<br>working-class new zealanders anymore we<br>we're not like that what what i mean by<br>that<br>is is and in new zealand it's quite<br>distinctive it is predominantly maori<br>and pacific island<br>and as well as pakia it is<br>driven a lot by the church by religion<br>importance of religion in that in<br>communities um uh<br>um sports um and<br>you know a sense of a culture that i<br>think<br>is not a working-class culture rather<br>than an academic<br>maori culture or pacific culture that is<br>not necessarily<br>being expressed in mainstream media and<br>i think<br>um you know it's funny i was thinking<br>what of all the social media platforms<br>we have<br>what is the one that i would say is is<br>the most authentically<br>working class in new zealand and i think<br>it's probably tick-tock<br>to be honest because you know in<br>ticktock you're getting<br>a really authentic voice of um<br>that that that isn't um necessarily<br>debating the things that we're all<br>debating tonight but<br>um you know to answer your question<br>there are definitely<br>uh um ways in which we can incorporate<br>a more diverse series of voices whether<br>maori pacific or pakia where we're<br>looking at not just those who are<br>have a mandate to express feel they have<br>a mandate to express<br>uh what it is to be a maori or pacific<br>experience but actually looking at<br>some of those communities where they may<br>not have as strong a voice<br>in mainstream media or even in politics<br>yes um<br>karen and i would very much like to<br>acknowledge uh the speakers and in<br>particular also<br>the attendees for their comments tonight<br>uh this topic has left us<br>hungry for more um and for more<br>opportunities to talk about<br>uh group think in the
