Te Tiriti o Waitangi suggests a framework for such responses and Te Tiriti is essential to effective leadership and decision-making throughout all our public institutions in Aotearoa. A Tiriti-based approach opens up possibilities of doing things differently, inviting deeper community participation, and drawing on values and knowledge systems that are too often overlooked in the usual policy responses.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>um<br>my my co-facilitators are on their way<br>um but i think<br>we might kick things off and they'll<br>come and pick up<br>foreign<br>and i'm an associate professor at the<br>faculty of law<br>at te hirangawaka victoria university of<br>wellington<br>and i work primarily on issues relating<br>to<br>tetri or was affecting maori and other<br>indigenous peoples<br>and tonight's event is<br>the final session in tahirah victoria<br>university of wellington's<br>leadership week which has been a week of<br>free<br>webinars which designed to spark action<br>on the issues that matter<br>and tonight we're going to be talking<br>about tetris<br>as a foundation for creative change<br>but uh before we go any further um<br>i would just like to begin with open up<br>really with a karakia<br>and given the time of year that we are<br>it is matariki and i want to come back<br>and talk a little bit about<br>matariki and why that might be relevant<br>to how we engage<br>this evening but i'll just start<br>so at this point i was going to<br>hand over to my co-facilitators to<br>introduce themselves<br>but we'll get them to say a little bit<br>about themselves when they<br>when they join um i'm very pleased to be<br>uh part of a session here with uh<br>tamitha paul and rihanna mora both<br>people who are working and engaged<br>with these issues in different kinds of<br>ways<br>tamitha a former student here and<br>rhianna a current student of<br>teherangawaka<br>so i do want to come back i mentioned<br>come back to talk a little bit about<br>matariki<br>uh because that is the time of year<br>that we're in um people might know<br>matariki is<br>as the maori new year matariki<br>is a star cluster and it appears<br>or reappears in our skies at this time<br>of year<br>and people think of it as the maori new<br>year because it's a time when<br>uh traditionally your harvesting was<br>finished your kind of winter food stocks<br>were plentiful<br>and so it was a time when you could<br>devote your energies<br>to other things um and you could<br>devote your energies to reflecting on<br>thinking about the year that has passed<br>what were some of the successes and some<br>of the failures<br>um over the past year and then<br>what are the things that you might want<br>to do to change and to innovate<br>and make a plan to do that so matariki<br>is very much a time<br>for reflection for innovation<br>and for planning and so i'd like to<br>encourage you to<br>keep that in mind as we as we talk about<br>these issues<br>relating to waitangi<br>now just to give you a little bit of a<br>sense about<br>uh how we're thinking this session might<br>go<br>this evening um<br>once my co-facilitators turn up we will<br>each take<br>a turn facilitating part of the session<br>uh and so i'll begin and and i'll start<br>by<br>touching on some of the opportunities<br>that uh territory framework might<br>provide<br>and then uh hopefully tam will be here<br>to take us<br>through thinking about some of the<br>current issues and urgent issues that<br>are in front of us<br>which might help us to work through<br>and then rihanna will point us to<br>some some of the transformational<br>we're hoping to keep the discussion um<br>relatively conversational and<br>intending to put questions<br>to each other and have some<br>conversations amongst ourselves but<br>we're certainly<br>aiming to leave some time at the end for<br>some questions uh and discussion time<br>uh with all of you and so i think you<br>might have seen from the slide at the<br>start<br>that there's a an opportunity to<br>put in um your questions into<br>the question and answer um space and<br>then<br>then that can be others can can<br>um upvote um things that they would like<br>to talk about that<br>appear there so if you use that we can<br>we can pick up<br>on uh on those issues there and i'm very<br>pleased<br>now to see um timothy and rihanna<br>join us um i've<br>just been explaining the kind of format<br>of the session<br>and that we intend to keep this quite<br>conversational that we're each going to<br>take a turn sort of<br>co-facilitating part of it uh i've<br>introduced myself briefly but now might<br>be an opportunity just for each of you<br>kyoto koto um yeah i saw this thing<br>recently on social media that said<br>we need to decolonize time so that's<br>what we're doing here just running on um<br>running on our mighty time just kidding<br>um<br>um my name's tam and um a brief<br>background about<br>around me um i was the student<br>association president last year for visa<br>and that was my full-time job and now i<br>am a wellington city councillor for the<br>central city<br>and i am responsible for climate change<br>young people<br>and city safety so yeah karakoto and<br>thank you for joining us for our cool<br>everyone my name is rihanna um i am<br>currently the university council<br>student representative for this year and<br>next year i've also<br>been on visa under the leadership of the<br>great tampa paul<br>i have also held executive positions on<br>ngaranga hotel which is the maori law<br>student society<br>as well as the feminist law society so<br>so let's just kick into it then<br>um i said that i would<br>start with a brief section of thinking<br>about the opportunities of<br>te taliti uh and really what i wanted to<br>do partly was just<br>to make sure we're all sort of starting<br>with<br>on uh on the same page in a sense<br>so i know there'll be lots of people who<br>are joining us who<br>work with the with te tariti a lot and<br>are very familiar with it and lots of<br>the arguments and discussions and<br>debates around it<br>um but i'm also aware that there might<br>be people who who don't have much of a<br>background in tetris so i just wanted to<br>make sure that we had<br>some key concepts that we're working<br>with in common<br>that that we can focus on and think<br>about<br>so just to to give a little<br>bit of a brief background then um<br>where i wanted to start was just by<br>pointing out and<br>again many people will be familiar with<br>with this this background but<br>um signed initially in waitangi<br>in waitangi in 1840<br>signed importantly by rangatira<br>by the leaders of various communities<br>um and by william hobson of course on<br>behalf of the british crown so we've got<br>an agreement<br>between various rangatira various<br>leaders<br>on behalf of their communities in the<br>british crown<br>and one of the things that we might look<br>to when we're thinking about<br>what what that agreement is like or what<br>the key exchange is<br>we can see that one of the things that<br>that the british crown is getting out of<br>this exchange<br>is a grant of some authority so in the<br>maori text and i'm going to<br>use the concepts from the maori text<br>maori text talks about kawanatanga going<br>to the british crown<br>kawanatanga as a concept<br>comes from the english word the base<br>word is kawana comes from the english<br>word governor<br>kawana governor kawana and kawanatanga<br>has those things to do with the governor<br>or government and we can think of it as<br>a function of government<br>and what we see on the other side of<br>that is<br>the kind of key concept uh that maori<br>are being guaranteed is this concept of<br>tenurangatiratanga<br>and rangatiratanga rangatiratanga we can<br>see the base word there<br>rangatira meaning chief or leader<br>rangatiratanga are those things to do<br>with<br>with the chiefs or chieftain ship and<br>their tinua at the start as an<br>intensifier so it's all those very<br>um and so one of the things that<br>that we might<br>begin by noting is that tetri wasn't<br>signed in a vacuum um<br>there was there's a there's a whole<br>background in context and history that's<br>that's important that sits behind that<br>we've just got a<br>sort of brief few minutes to introduce<br>some of these ideas here<br>um but one of the things that is<br>important is the 1835 declaration of<br>independence<br>which uh a group of chiefs<br>in the north declared that they<br>collectively exercised<br>authority independence sovereignty<br>uh and so this is a precursor to te<br>turito waitangi<br>and it's part of why<br>this grant of kawanatanga is is so<br>significant<br>because it marks a shift between<br>the rangatira exercising all authority<br>in aotearoa to opening up space for this<br>other form of governmental authority to<br>take place<br>to be exercised now many people will be<br>aware about<br>the fact that there's an english text<br>and a maori text of t of the treaty<br>and um that<br>that there are some debates about the<br>different meanings<br>uh between those and<br>of course the english text uses the word<br>sovereignty the waitangi tribunal has<br>been pretty clear that<br>those rangatira who signed on the 6th of<br>february in 1840<br>would not have and could not have given<br>up their sovereignty<br>and so what they were providing for was<br>this grant of kawanatanga<br>this ability for the british crown to<br>exercise<br>some governmental authority um and the<br>intention the tribunal says<br>was that that would be in relation to<br>the settler population<br>but the key point really for me i think<br>that i'd like you to think about is that<br>no matter<br>how you characterize that grant of<br>authority<br>um it's it's not a small thing it's<br>quite a significant shift from maori<br>exercising authority to opening up a<br>space<br>for another form of authority to happen<br>and<br>by the same token the concept of<br>tinurangateratanga<br>is by no means a small<br>concept or a small guarantee this is a<br>significant guarantee about<br>the exercise of the absolute chiefly<br>authority<br>so what we end up with is a sharing of<br>public power<br>deteriorating doesn't set out the terms<br>on which the<br>precise terms on which that public power<br>is going to be exercised<br>and so we have since 1840<br>been working through um trying to<br>understand in<br>specific circumstances what that<br>relationship between tinu rangatiratanga<br>and kawanatanga might look like what<br>that means in specific<br>contexts um and<br>so that's a that's a very brief<br>um capturing of a couple of key concepts<br>that are<br>in te ti uh and what i'd like to<br>turn to um tam and rihanna<br>here to ask them is how<br>you're both people who who work with te<br>tereti in different ways<br>um and i'll be interested in hearing<br>from you<br>um how you see those those two concepts<br>and how you you talk about the<br>relationship they create<br>and in some of the work that you do<br>um i think for me one of the big things<br>is trying to dispel some of the<br>underlying assumptions that people have<br>around what is reasonable um<br>or what is consultation and i think<br>that's because<br>there hasn't been enough um at least<br>day-to-day discourse around<br>how these two concepts should interact<br>what is the relational sphere<br>between the two is something that i'm<br>really interested in and it's not a<br>sphere<br>in which um rangatiratanga<br>only operates in accordance with the<br>kawanatanga framework<br>but rather how do we empower the<br>exercise of rangatiratanga<br>um in its own right and so it's sort of<br>going beyond<br>um for example consulting<br>uh consulting with maori and actually<br>trying to step towards how do you<br>empower<br>maori um to be involved in the decision<br>making process so do you have maori<br>um at the decision making table and are<br>you listening to them because<br>i think sometimes maori views can get<br>balanced out<br>in the process in which we call<br>consultation and so<br>there really needs to be a recognition<br>that<br>you know the exercise of rangatiratanga<br>informs the substantive decision it's<br>not just a<br>procedural sort of tick box exercise<br>and so you have to make sure that<br>whatever outcome<br>that you're deciding is good for maori<br>it's not sufficient to say that you talk<br>to<br>two maori people that you know um so<br>that's my experience<br>yeah and i think to be honest um<br>i i think about it in<br>in relation to the issues that we deal<br>with and so i might just like<br>park that question until i talk about<br>some of those issues<br>because it's um hard to conceptualize<br>unless we're actually talking about<br>those and i don't want to take a deep<br>dive into those just yet so i'll<br>okay so that that i think that's really<br>really helpful from<br>both of you because um it will be useful<br>to talk about<br>these kind of big concepts kawanatanga<br>and<br>in relation to specific issues because i<br>think that helps to<br>take that kind of abstract and make it<br>quite real and concrete and practical<br>and you know i think it's really helpful<br>rihanna to raise that idea of<br>those spheres of authority and that's a<br>that's a way in which<br>the waitangi tribunal has talked about<br>it it's a way in which<br>um the mataki mai aotearoa the working<br>group on constitutional transformation<br>talk about it<br>so that it's thinking about um both<br>both what what might be involved with<br>tinoranga terratanga<br>what is involved with kawanatanga but<br>importantly what the relationship is<br>between them<br>and how you you manage that space in<br>between how you<br>give effect to the the the authority<br>that though<br>that are exercised in those different<br>spheres um separately as well<br>and and that point about thinking around<br>going ensuring that that<br>is reflected in in decision making<br>authority i think is really important<br>we've just had some<br>uh a report about reforming the resource<br>management act<br>come out in the last couple of days<br>which is proposing<br>a maori advisory board um and so there's<br>a real question around<br>well advice isn't being part of the<br>decision making<br>and so how does that reflect tanoranga<br>tiratanga<br>in that way so both really helpful kinds<br>of points<br>i don't know whether either of you had<br>um<br>tim you mentioned you you want to come<br>back to talk about some specific issues<br>so maybe that's that's actually where we<br>where we move<br>to now and i will hand over to you<br>to kind of introduce the<br>some of these urgent and current issues<br>that we're dealing with in here tetris<br>a territory framework might be relevant<br>there<br>i mean so yeah i'm fully preface this<br>with<br>um i am not a law student nor a law<br>professor and i don't understand tdt in<br>in the sense of well i do but not not in<br>a legal sense so i'm thinking about it<br>in a practical sense and how it's<br>applied and how the current<br>systems that we're constrained by and<br>prevent us from making transformational<br>change<br>and so when i go back home and my<br>friends are like so what are you up to<br>what's the what's the goals what's the<br>plan is that<br>was the prime minister i get all thomas<br>actually no what i'm really into<br>is constitutional transformation and<br>when you're talking about that with<br>real people that as a concept just seems<br>so far away but when you break it down<br>into issues that people really care<br>about you can see<br>that the changes that we need to move<br>towards and the mindsets that we need to<br>change and shift<br>can only come from within system change<br>and so i wanted to talk about a few<br>issues<br>um and how they are relevant to systems<br>and<br>um really keen to hear um both of your<br>focado and these as well so<br>um i picked a few issues that um are<br>relevant right now or that i care about<br>quite a lot and i just wanted to talk<br>about how the current system that we<br>have<br>um reinforces or perpetuates those<br>issues<br>um so the first um<br>issue that i wanted to talk about is um<br>it's kind of a collection<br>of it seems that we're having a bit of a<br>this year has been the year for<br>difficult conversations or challenging<br>conversations um<br>and we've seen that through the black<br>lives matter movement um<br>within indigenous communities really<br>looking within and asking ourselves<br>what forms of anti-blackness do we carry<br>and do we need to dismantle<br>and also with the statue conversation um<br>and and all of those kind of<br>conversations even over the last few<br>um you know we're we're having all of<br>these conversations and they're really<br>being brought to the fore where<br>everybody feels that they can<br>participate in them<br>and so i've been thinking a bit about<br>how the system that we have so the<br>westminster system<br>how that reinforces um<br>how that reinforces racism in our<br>society but i'm also going to talk a bit<br>about climate change and a bit about our<br>about um cover 19 as well so when it<br>comes to<br>i think talking about race or<br>understanding race and thinking about<br>because obviously we have all of these<br>issues that have been brought to the<br>fore<br>and i think we we're having these<br>conversations but it's hard to know<br>where to go from there because<br>how do you implement an anti-racist<br>policy within an inherently racist<br>system<br>and when i when i think about<br>when i'm when i'm talking i always think<br>about things in the way that i talk to<br>my friends back home so<br>when i'm talking to them and and i'm you<br>know i'm trying to describe to them what<br>um what's wrong with the current system<br>that we have i think about<br>parliament and the kind of<br>constitutional principles that it<br>creates and expresses through the policy<br>that it makes<br>so one of those is is the rule of law<br>and how law and order is supreme in this<br>society that we have and how that<br>is a principle that was brought over um<br>through colonization and how that was a<br>really key principle<br>um in in british society<br>and to me that means that law is supreme<br>and that is upheld through the different<br>systems so through the police and<br>through<br>um you know just the way that we live<br>our lives is within the<br>constrains of the law but when you think<br>about who<br>created that law because you know when<br>you're looking at um<br>our prison statistics and those kinds of<br>things a lot of people will say well if<br>you<br>if you obey the law then you have<br>nothing to worry about<br>but when we look at the statistics and<br>break those down we see that<br>non-maori oh sorry that maori are more<br>times more likely to<br>appear before a judge many times more<br>likely to receive a<br>um a criminal conviction and harsher<br>sentencing than their non-maori<br>counterparts and so when we're thinking<br>about the rule of law and how that is<br>upheld through all the different<br>institutions around us from the health<br>system the education system the justice<br>system<br>and police you know that's a massive<br>conversation that we're having right now<br>that is upholding a law that has been<br>created by<br>you know if we're going to call a spade<br>a spade white men old white men<br>and their and their need to protect<br>their private property and that is what<br>the law is created around<br>so if you if you have a a kind of<br>if your society is structured around the<br>rule of law and upholding that then how<br>can we ever make space for anybody that<br>isn't an old white man<br>let's be honest because that is what it<br>reinforces and so when i think about<br>implementing policies or or adding<br>adding in you know initiatives that<br>actually<br>deal with the racist institutions that<br>we have built up around us those will<br>always be insufficient because they<br>don't get at the heart of the system<br>that is built up to protect<br>these people and private property so um<br>and then we move to climate change<br>so that i guess all of the<br>the way that i think about it is um with<br>climate change<br>we have people<br>pushing for various different um<br>policies that might be able to<br>um change the way that we deal with that<br>whether it's the emissions trading<br>scheme<br>or whether it's getting more electric<br>vehicles and you know getting more<br>people owning those<br>particularly at the city council a lot<br>of our plans to be the first carbon zero<br>capital<br>uh premised on the assumption that<br>everyone will get yeah get an electric<br>vehicle and everyone will cycle to work<br>and<br>and all of these things but it doesn't<br>get at the heart of what's wrong with<br>the capitalist system so it goes back to<br>that systemic stuff because what i've<br>found is that<br>you go round and round in circles and<br>you find all of these solutions but<br>they're just plasters on what is a<br>broken crumbled<br>archaic system that actually needs to go<br>and so um when i'm thinking about<br>climate change<br>and capitalism that is premised on the<br>mindset that our natural tongue our<br>um the things that are in the ground the<br>things that flow through our rivers the<br>things that are in our moana all of<br>these things<br>are um disposable and that they can be<br>extracted or degraded in order to build<br>up our capital<br>um and so and another thing that i'm<br>realizing is that so much of our system<br>is built up around protecting private<br>property<br>and and there's a real mindset that<br>people<br>are entitled to their private property<br>and that's something that's been carried<br>over through the<br>westminster system that we have which is<br>prep is heavily<br>um you know structured around protecting<br>private property and people's rights you<br>know their god-given right to own<br>something and to<br>have the exclusive right to own what<br>that is and that<br>drives a very individualistic mindset<br>that is inherent within our society<br>and so when so for example when we're<br>trying to deal with climate change<br>on a city council level if we're trying<br>to remove private parking to make space<br>for cycleway so that people can<br>get to and from work in a sustainable<br>way um<br>even the idea to remove a car park<br>creates so much vitriol from the<br>community because in people's minds<br>they have a god-given right to park<br>their car there that they<br>own and it's the same with land we're<br>having a conversation currently around<br>building more density within the city so<br>that we can create more homes so that<br>people actually have somewhere to live<br>and you don't have 50 to 100 people<br>turning up to a flat viewing<br>however people that have their one house<br>on their one plot of land<br>they they believe that that's their that<br>that's their kind of<br>right to have that land and to keep that<br>there and it is because that is what is<br>protected by the system that we have and<br>if we want to move to a mind frame or a<br>collective mind frame where we are<br>thinking collectively and we're thinking<br>about our actions and the decisions that<br>we make every single day in a collective<br>sense<br>that's not something that can come<br>through a system that is premised on<br>individualism and<br>your right to owning private property<br>you know<br>so that's i guess goes back to<br>i guess it's like that ruthless<br>individualism that is expressed through<br>parliament<br>and what i've found is that even when<br>you have<br>what is it like 29 of mps are maori<br>it doesn't matter because if those<br>constitutional um<br>principles are premised around people's<br>individual rights to<br>own property and when it's so individual<br>you can never get at the collective<br>you can never get at the sense of people<br>thinking<br>collectively and and thinking what<br>impact<br>do my actions have on the collective you<br>know what what impacts does that have on<br>the community and everybody around me<br>um and so i just wanted to talk very<br>briefly about covert 19 and i think that<br>really showed a potential for how<br>quickly systems can collapse<br>so we saw all around us um you know the<br>economy absolutely collapsed and that's<br>something that we<br>prior to covert you know we propped it<br>up so high<br>as something that cannot change or where<br>there is no room<br>we saw the government come in and make<br>changes that they wouldn't have even<br>entertained had covered not<br>come around and things that we were told<br>as the people that was not possible<br>um so yeah i think that really shows<br>that radical change can happen<br>and that um and that they're<br>yeah so i think that shows yeah that<br>that radical change can happen and i<br>think we've started to have a<br>conversation about what systems we<br>can have or um you know we're starting<br>to have a conversation about whether the<br>systems that we do have whether they<br>serve<br>people in the collective sense or<br>whether they serve people individually<br>so um i think that's pretty much what<br>i'm<br>gonna say but i just had a few questions<br>as well for for cohen and reid to bring<br>them in on this whole<br>topic of um you know issues based<br>um constitutional transformation and i<br>just um wanted to ask ree what your<br>thoughts are<br>around um i guess current issues and how<br>they're relevant to territory and<br>i guess systems and how they actively<br>uphold inequities within our society<br>i feel like i can't add much more to<br>that but i'll try<br>um so as an honest student one of my<br>seminars is actually on welfare and<br>social security law<br>and i've actually been really interested<br>in looking at the wage subsidy<br>um that has sort of been introduced<br>through<br>covert 19 and i think a lot of what you<br>were saying tam is about<br>interrogating these underlying values um<br>that we hold and what is um<br>you know we don't ask that question<br>because a lot of our values<br>actually don't consider tikanga or<br>tikanga values<br>and so what i've really been interested<br>in is this notion between like people<br>who are deserving and people who are<br>undeserving<br>um and i think that linking into your<br>comments about um the law being premised<br>on<br>the old white man and capitalism and<br>sort of being able to bear the fruits of<br>your labor<br>i think what we have seen is a<br>government who perhaps<br>cheapens the words such as aroha such as<br>care such as<br>um manakitanga in terms<br>of you know providing the wage subsidy<br>however if we actually look at the wage<br>subsidy<br>it's really only been implemented<br>because it affects<br>uh the most privileged people and people<br>who<br>you know would otherwise have high<br>paying jobs<br>rather than the single maori mother on<br>the benefit<br>who has to provide for her kids and so<br>and i feel like we need to start<br>interrogating<br>these values and not just accepting sort<br>of<br>handouts where they where they are given<br>and<br>praising the government for being so<br>caring when actually<br>who does it serve um who do these<br>policies<br>actually serve and it certainly isn't<br>maori um<br>so that's just my facade or but perhaps<br>cohen<br>um you know what kinds of<br>policy changes or implementation<br>do you think could reverse um sort of<br>some of the<br>negative statistics about maori so i<br>know you've done some work<br>um for the justice advisory group<br>particularly in prisons so i would just<br>wondered um what's your fukado<br>on there yeah well i mean one of the<br>things that<br>came through very strongly with us in<br>the in the justice sector work<br>was excuse me um was<br>what people told us what maori<br>communities told us<br>and what indeed what all the evidence<br>suggested and<br>what a lot of um pakia communities that<br>we talked to told us as well<br>was that we needed to find solutions<br>that were by<br>maori for maori um and so that that<br>really seemed to be at the heart<br>of of a lot of what people wanted to see<br>happening within the justice sector<br>um maori communities or people maori<br>people that we talked to as part of that<br>process<br>told us that um they'd seen<br>elements of tikanga maori be picked up<br>and used in the justice sector but had<br>been kind of divorced<br>from the wider setting that it was in<br>the context that it was in and so<br>it didn't make sense it didn't work<br>because it wasn't<br>grounded in the kind of whanau networks<br>that<br>um that those those processes or those<br>concepts were<br>were intended to be in but i think that<br>all<br>kind of points to um i mean that that's<br>really the issue and that that's the<br>constitutional<br>issue really is is how to um<br>achieve a kind of bi-maori formality<br>approach<br>across the range of things because this<br>is of course something that that was<br>raised in the context of health care and<br>by the tribunal and that the<br>whole order report was to have a kind of<br>independent maori health authority that<br>that<br>would would guide that work so<br>and it's what was behind the the<br>constitutional working group um<br>being established was that that what<br>what people were seeing what maori was<br>seeing was<br>having to um being reactive or<br>across a whole range of different<br>subject areas when actually the real<br>question was that fundamental one about<br>um how those though how decisions were<br>being made and<br>how um that the kind of different<br>spheres of authority that that you<br>raised earlier rihanna<br>were being recognized or not being<br>recognized<br>and and i think that you know the issues<br>that you've raised him too around<br>things like uh climate change is a<br>really good example because that's<br>that's uh something where it's quite<br>clear<br>that the way we've been operating in the<br>system that's created the problem<br>isn't able to produce and a solution<br>to how to deal with climate change that<br>you need to look outside the system<br>that's created the problem<br>and one of the things that encourages us<br>encourages us to do is to think about<br>different ways of operating to draw<br>on different tools to engage different<br>voices to have different voices in the<br>decision-making process<br>and we can see a little glimpse of that<br>in some of the<br>recent treaty settlements for example<br>things like settlement in relation to<br>the whanganui river tauratupua<br>which and and this you know this is<br>really just a small glimpse of what the<br>potential might be<br>but what's happened there is that that<br>settlement has<br>created a different way not just for<br>the ewe of whanganui to interact with<br>with the river<br>but it's required everyone to can<br>reconceptualize the way they relate to<br>the<br>river the way they understand it um the<br>way it's understood in the holistic<br>sense<br>uh the way in which communities are part<br>of that river system<br>and it's those kinds of uh ideas that<br>that help us to kind of change the way<br>in which we think about things and te<br>taliti provides<br>um a framework for starting those<br>conversations for<br>drawing on those different tools in<br>and i suppose what i just wanted to add<br>was um<br>that although i i think what turns a lot<br>of people off when we talk about te<br>tiriti<br>is that they feel that i think when<br>people don't understand what it is they<br>feel that it's a system<br>that might only serve maori or that is<br>really just a process of<br>um i guess um a process of<br>um what's that word re when you give<br>everything back<br>what's it called again we you know i<br>feel like people think it is going to be<br>a process literally<br>yeah yeah i guess a process of<br>redressing so i think<br>a lot of people therefore don't see<br>themselves reflected into<br>ttt but i think the really important<br>part is that it offers an alternative to<br>the current system that we have not only<br>that<br>but effort is te kanga maori i think<br>that's the important thing about te<br>kanga maori no matter where you're from<br>across altera<br>knowing that te kanga is adaptable agile<br>and flexible<br>but it is inclusive and i think that's<br>the most important<br>element of it is that it is it is<br>inclusive of everybody that chooses to<br>call aotearoa home and it doesn't it's<br>not transactional<br>it doesn't ask you to have a<br>transactional relationship because it<br>doesn't ask of you<br>um it asks you to think collectively and<br>to think about<br>the ways in which you give back to your<br>community and so i think the<br>the most important part of this whole<br>conversation is that we i think we're<br>all getting to the point where we can<br>acknowledge that the system that we have<br>only serves a particular portion of<br>society<br>and that's not woman that's not<br>takatapui that's not disabled people<br>you know that's not any of those groups<br>and so<br>i think we all need to get to the space<br>where we can allow people to imagine<br>a different society that could look<br>different that is inclusive to all and i<br>think<br>um like i said before te turiti gives us<br>all a place of standing here in aotearoa<br>because it encompasses all of us<br>um and so i think there's like that high<br>conceptual kind of understanding of it<br>but i think the other<br>really important element is that it that<br>tao maori and<br>maori it provides practical solutions to<br>the issues that are facing us<br>as well um you know not just the<br>governance space not just the<br>kawanatanga not just the tinoranga<br>tiratanga space<br>but with that tinoranga tiratanga space<br>comes the re-indigenization<br>of um the solutions that we seek to the<br>problems that we're looking at so<br>you know when i'm sitting around the<br>table and i'm hearing people talking you<br>know talking up like oh have you seen<br>this new<br>system about donut economics donut<br>economics is not a new concept<br>this idea of having ecological ceilings<br>you know<br>having these limits um you know these<br>environmental bottom lines that you<br>cannot<br>um you cannot step past them we've known<br>about them in fact we<br>know what those are intimately here in<br>aotearoa and within the pacific<br>this idea of having social foundations<br>or levels<br>social bottom lines like i.e not letting<br>people be homeless<br>not um making people stay in unsafe<br>homes or<br>um you know people being able to go out<br>and have a night in town and not be<br>afraid to<br>that they're gonna be harmed or<br>assaulted or harassed those<br>those concepts are all wrapped up and<br>have been here for a long time<br>and we just need to get to a place where<br>we can start to<br>rediscover those and hone our memories<br>in a way that allows us to rediscover<br>those things<br>when i think about climate change it's<br>the cool trendy thing and people are<br>talking about<br>regenerative agriculture and um urban<br>farming<br>that's a concept of madakai that's<br>that's you know that's an indigenous<br>concept<br>the concept of giving tangaroa a day of<br>rest a day in which we don't swim we<br>don't catch kai we don't do anything we<br>let tangora<br>rest those are non-transactional ways<br>that we take care of the environment and<br>there are also<br>non-transactional ways collective ways<br>that we look after our community after<br>whanau<br>after our hapu after everybody in the<br>community and those are things that we<br>have to reconnect with so when i look at<br>these new concepts<br>i think it's about actually reversing<br>and trying to figure out actually<br>what does titarity look like in a 21st<br>century context how do we merge<br>all of these this melting pot of<br>cultures that we have here in aotearoa<br>to find a system<br>or to create or imagine a system that<br>allows us to reconnect<br>re-indigenize and find those solutions<br>rather than looking outwards i think we<br>need to look inwards so that's just<br>my two cents on that but reid did you<br>want to um<br>talk a little bit about um what what can<br>people do to actually because we talk<br>about<br>teterite as something that's like up<br>there but people<br>in their everyday individual capacity<br>can help us get to that level so<br>what does that look like yeah look i<br>think it's important to try and bring<br>the conversation back down to<br>who is listening um to us tonight and i<br>think there are lots of students<br>here tonight which i am so happy about<br>um but also there's a lot of<br>professionals here<br>and so what i really want to emphasize<br>is that<br>constitutional transformation is<br>possible<br>um in your day-to-day lives because all<br>of us hold<br>positions of power and so it's about<br>what do we do with those positions um<br>and how is tertiary able to provide a<br>framework for<br>the decisions that we make um or how we<br>interact with people<br>um and how we have relationships with<br>people um<br>and so you know humans are agents of<br>change<br>is sort of the title that i would like<br>to start off with<br>um and you know we make decisions every<br>day and so<br>there's a potential for everyone to sort<br>of make this<br>a reality and i just really want to<br>stress<br>and dispel this myth that tertility is<br>not<br>isolated to maori issues and<br>i think this whole conversation has<br>actually shown that it's integrated into<br>a spectrum of issues<br>and often in my position as a student<br>representative<br>in many different capacities you know<br>as a university we talk about being a<br>values-based university<br>and we talk about damarai being at the<br>heart of the institution<br>um and so something that i'm always<br>pushing for at the council table is<br>where are those values in every single<br>business case that you present to me<br>in every single decision that we make<br>where is tertiary<br>where is the mariah at the heart of this<br>institution<br>because it's not enough to sort of<br>tack um the values and an appendix at<br>the end and say<br>oh by the way um this decision considers<br>um all the values of the university<br>and that's sort of going back to my<br>point earlier which is that<br>tertiary and the values that it brings<br>with it actually has to<br>um somehow color inform or provide a<br>central part<br>um of your decisions that you're making<br>so when you make a decision<br>is this good for our maori students is<br>this good for all students because are<br>we showing manakitanga<br>you know that is a value in which we<br>need to see coming through<br>um and another thing<br>is that when we're in these positions of<br>power i think it's really important to<br>think about<br>are we listening um and i don't think<br>people talk<br>a lot about sort of the notion of<br>listening<br>um and so my sort of<br>widow to everyone who is watching is<br>that if you're<br>a student leader or if you're a part of<br>any professional organization<br>think about how you can give up power um<br>and not take up space or how can you<br>make these spaces<br>safe for conversations um that need to<br>be had conversations about tertiary<br>um how can the table be a safe space for<br>maori<br>because it needs to be um<br>and just going off that sort of decision<br>making table point i think<br>that also imposes an obligation on<br>people who are in these positions<br>of power to build your capacity build<br>your capability<br>um you know if you're if you're calling<br>yourself<br>a treaty partner by virtue of being on<br>this land by living in new zealand um<br>i think you have an obligation to learn<br>our history<br>it's your history too and how are you<br>connected to tertiary<br>because i think it's important for<br>everyone to know their whakapapa<br>um and your connection to this land and<br>how you can be<br>a good treaty partner and that doesn't<br>mean just going and learning your pepe<br>and just on that point tam i mean<br>you were the first wahine maori<br>president abuser um<br>so how did how were you able to bring a<br>tertiary lens<br>to an organization which has<br>traditionally been<br>non-maori and actually serve the needs<br>um<br>of a lot of white men in the past<br>yeah yes um so i think i think the<br>the i would even start with that<br>question um<br>so i think the the really key thing is<br>really goes back to what you're just<br>saying is that when you are at the table<br>like it's not just enough to be at the<br>table particularly if you're<br>a woman if you're maori if you belong to<br>any community that's<br>not represented around the table it's<br>not enough to just get into that<br>position and<br>be there if you know that you can bring<br>more voices with you<br>so for example um<br>when i would be at a table rather than<br>me just being like<br>well it's awesome to be at this table<br>because i'm a maori woman that's just<br>that's that's not going further that's<br>not going further enough because i know<br>that i can say<br>where is naitoeidah had this<br>conversation whereas the maori students<br>association<br>where as the pacifica students um<br>council at this conversation so<br>it's it's not just about you know if you<br>have the privilege to be able to get to<br>that table<br>it's not just about getting in the door<br>it's about holding it open for those to<br>come<br>you know those to come to join you at<br>the table<br>and then when we're all at the table we<br>can start taking it apart and rebuilding<br>our own table<br>you know because we don't need that one<br>um so i think that that's the most<br>important part is not getting complicit<br>in that privilege and being able to see<br>okay who needs to be at this<br>conversation you know who needs to be at<br>this table<br>and what power can i give away so that<br>they are<br>able to um bring more people with them<br>to their table and they're able to be<br>there in a meaningful way so like you<br>know we said at the beginning not just<br>consultative kind of requirements and<br>just giving a little bit of feedback<br>like how can they meaningfully be there<br>and<br>be agents of change to be able to you<br>know make the<br>make that change or drive any change<br>that they want to make<br>i suppose and i think it's about<br>um sort of actively seeking those voices<br>and being able to uplift them that's<br>something<br>in which you know we did as as part of<br>busa is we would actively make sure that<br>the maori students associations<br>had a voice at that table um and i think<br>it's an excuse<br>to be honest to say oh well they didn't<br>reply to my email<br>um that's a common thing is when you're<br>in an institution<br>everyone sends emails but marty don't<br>speak through emails 99 of the time and<br>so<br>if you go oh but i emailed them and they<br>didn't reply well that's not good enough<br>go for them would i<br>um and and go to their buddy knock on<br>their door<br>and say hey i've got a place for you<br>will you come with me<br>um and so this is sort of<br>a little bit of a random segue but i'm<br>gonna go to carlin<br>um so i'm really interested as<br>an educator and as an associate<br>professor of law<br>you know what obligations do you think<br>uh<br>perhaps tertiary institutions<br>or um you know institutions that have<br>authority to educate people<br>um what what obligations do you think<br>they have in terms<br>of sort of being the critic and<br>conscience of society<br>yeah i mean i think there are i i i<br>would<br>think about both um the obligations and<br>the opportunities of<br>um participating in in an institution<br>which is dealing with both<br>research and teaching um so<br>one of the things that that you've both<br>talked about already is that idea of<br>creating space for other voices<br>um recognizing the<br>privileged position that you know where<br>we<br>occupy positions of privilege<br>recognizing that and thinking about<br>how to bring<br>other people along how to give up<br>some um some power some resources is<br>often<br>often what's at stake and so i think in<br>the for a university in the research<br>space<br>one of the things that i constantly<br>think about is<br>you know how how do i leverage<br>the the role of the university the<br>position that i occupy here<br>to to try and um<br>uh make some space for for maori voices<br>um and if i'm engaged in a research<br>project relating to<br>maori um to think about well how<br>how can i kind of de-center myself<br>as the academic um not think about the<br>research project that i<br>want to do but to think about engaging<br>with<br>maori communities to say well you know<br>what is what are your research needs<br>what are the things that you'd like to<br>work on what is the<br>capability or capacity that you might<br>like to build that i can support with<br>in conducting this research and and i<br>think that<br>that's really hard for a lot of a lot of<br>academics who<br>you know one of the things that that's<br>really privileged about our position is<br>being able to work on projects and<br>research that we<br>we wish to but but kind of de-centering<br>ourselves and actually giving up some of<br>the power<br>about what are the things that we focus<br>on<br>and in that universities<br>do have a role as critic and conscience<br>of society i think it's incumbent on us<br>to<br>ensure that we are all um<br>censoring maori in our research<br>and i think this has become<br>i've seen it particularly visible in the<br>context of<br>some of the discussions around um covert<br>19 and the<br>government response to covert 19 where<br>people are<br>proposing work research having those<br>those issues which are both public<br>health issues<br>there are economic issues there are<br>issues about the exercise of state<br>powers<br>all involved in this this response and<br>i think it's really important that we<br>centre maori because one of the things<br>we<br>one of the things we know is that where<br>the state has coercive<br>powers that maori will have those powers<br>exercised against them will bear the<br>burden of that<br>where the economy is uh<br>suffers some blow then maori bear a<br>disproportionate<br>burden of that economic cost um<br>and we know that there are where where<br>health<br>resources are scarce and um<br>whether those resources are prioritized<br>for issues when you're not<br>centering maori we are not adopting a<br>tariti framework to thinking about or<br>even an equity framework to thinking<br>about how<br>those health resources are delivered<br>then again maori are amongst the groups<br>that<br>that be a disproportionate burden so<br>it's really important for us<br>as as as researchers as part of<br>a part of an institution which is it<br>does have a role as a critical<br>conscience of society that<br>we are ensuring that those issues are<br>centered<br>in the work that we are doing that we're<br>thinking about constantly reflecting on<br>uh you know what might what does what<br>does this mean for maori communities and<br>how can i centre<br>those experiences and the work that i do<br>yeah that's my thoughts on that i mean<br>and i i suppose i just wanted to add<br>um i see there's like a few questions<br>which we'll probably get to in a minute<br>i just wanted to add<br>something so i suppose it all does seem<br>still very high level but real obviously<br>offered some practical<br>um ways that we can um we can<br>we can do this so i think i think the<br>kind of key messages um with this<br>corridor is that<br>the systems that we currently have<br>around us constrain us in every possible<br>way no matter what<br>issue you care about whether you are<br>environmentally minded and you care<br>about climate change or the preservation<br>of<br>our indigenous biodiversity or you want<br>people to cycle and walk more<br>whether you're more interested in social<br>justice and you're worried about<br>the fact that babies are snatched out of<br>their mother's arms and then thrown into<br>state care which is abusive and then put<br>into an education system<br>that is so one-dimensional or whether it<br>is that<br>our health system disproportionately um<br>you know<br>um deals with in a negative way i can't<br>think of the word with maori pacific<br>people you know whatever it is that you<br>care about<br>all of it can be you know we we can't<br>we can't rediscover the tools to deal<br>with the issues until we get rid of the<br>shackles that bind us which are<br>wrapped up in the system that we<br>imported over here that doesn't work for<br>anybody<br>especially not our increasingly diverse<br>society<br>it's beautiful that we have so many<br>cultures here in aotearoa but<br>um you know we need to this would be<br>ultimo to be a safe home for people and<br>that means needing an inclusive system<br>however when we think about systemic<br>change and we think about you know those<br>legends like paul moana jackson and um<br>professor margaret motu and we think<br>about how<br>long they've been talking about this it<br>can be really off-putting and we can<br>begin to feel really hopeless because<br>we think to ourselves oh my gosh systems<br>change<br>constitutional transformation is so far<br>down the road i might never see it in my<br>lifetime<br>and so i don't know like i don't want to<br>i'd rather go for a short term when you<br>know a policy change or that<br>thinking about constitutional<br>transformation and and<br>and really embedding that into your<br>everyday life is the essence of being a<br>good<br>tipuna and it's a long-term game<br>and none of us we might not see it in<br>our lifetime but that's besides the<br>point it's about being a good typo<br>no matter we no matter we whether you're<br>maori pakistani<br>whatever you you have to think about you<br>have to think down the road right down<br>the road and<br>the way we need to think about it is<br>that we pick up our baton and we run it<br>as far as we can and then we leave it in<br>a place that our kids and their kids can<br>pick it up and take it<br>even further and like resaves we make<br>decisions every single day and as a<br>collective that can be really powerful<br>we make decisions about what food we're<br>gonna buy you know do you go to<br>mcdonald's or do you support the local<br>cafe<br>what clothes we get are we gonna get<br>something ethical or something<br>secondhand or are we gonna get something<br>that<br>someone got paid four cents an hour to<br>make for us we make decisions about what<br>we do with our time do we get on the<br>piss every night or do we actually take<br>some time to reflect and<br>think about ourselves and who we are and<br>what the significance are what<br>sacrifices did your ancestors make for<br>you to be here<br>living in this country that you know for<br>the problems that we have we are pretty<br>lucky to be here especially right now so<br>what sacrifices<br>that the people that you descend from<br>what did they have to sacrifice for you<br>to be in this position<br>so we make these decisions every single<br>day and if we at least<br>just be a bit more conscious about the<br>decisions that we make<br>that is how we get somewhere and if<br>everybody is doing that<br>that is how we can get to somewhere<br>where our kids can pick it up and have a<br>decent chance at running it even further<br>than we could take it so<br>i think especially when it comes to<br>thinking about how<br>we use our time like i think it's really<br>important particularly during this<br>period of matariki it's a time where we<br>are thinking and reflecting about<br>ourselves and our place here where we<br>stand in aotearoa<br>thinking about how does titarity apply<br>to my life<br>you don't have to be a lawyer a<br>politician or any of the people that we<br>prop up to be the ones that are going to<br>make the change<br>change seldom comes from an individual<br>person it comes from a collective<br>and no matter what you are into and no<br>matter what you do or what you are<br>passionate about<br>if you do it in a way that brings people<br>up with you<br>and that thinks about and creatively<br>imagines a different alternative reality<br>then that is how we create change so for<br>example um<br>i'm thinking about all the time i'm<br>thinking about climate change all the<br>time and i'm thinking about local<br>government<br>a way that we decolonize that is we need<br>a devolution of resources and power<br>making decisions from central government<br>down to the local level to our hapu to<br>our ewe<br>and in the kawanatanga sphere to our<br>local body so<br>you don't have to be like getting on a<br>panel and talking about constitutional<br>transformation all day long<br>if everyone just thinks about how it is<br>relevant<br>and their particular area that they're<br>interested in and that you're good at<br>and that motivates you and makes you<br>want to get out of the bed in the<br>morning then that's all you need to do<br>you don't have to be the one that<br>leads the big march down from up north<br>down to wellington<br>um and i think the other thing with that<br>is when you're thinking about<br>how can i decolonize or reindigenize the<br>area that i'm passionate about or my<br>organization or my student group<br>just remember that library says i guess<br>maori are not resources you can't just<br>email them and say hey can we get a<br>coffee and can you just tell me how to<br>like decolonize my group real quick<br>it's about building up trust and that is<br>a universal truth even as maori i can't<br>go to my<br>i couldn't go to america and just say<br>well i'm maori can you just tell me real<br>quick about how i um<br>re-indigenize the climate change space<br>no i would have to be in the kitchen<br>doing the dishes for a very long time i<br>would have to be<br>taking the rubber shower you have to<br>build up that trust and<br>and and show people that you are worthy<br>of their time and their knowledge<br>because that's just a universal thing so<br>we've got to build up those<br>relationships it's about having trust in<br>your community<br>and building up those relationships and<br>then one day they might decide that they<br>want to share some knowledge with you<br>but they might not as well but that's<br>just something that we have to do as<br>human beings is make their human<br>connection and<br>actually build up that trust so that we<br>can help each other<br>and i think another thing you know call<br>out racism if some<br>not just racism call out anything that's<br>problematic in your life because<br>although<br>you know i get typecasted as the white<br>counsellor because i'd be doing that but<br>that's<br>that's besides the point we haven't if<br>we are in rooms where things are being<br>said that we don't agree with<br>you don't have to necessarily know all<br>the answers but call it out<br>expose racism and the in the<br>the imperial system that we have for the<br>ugliness that it is you know<br>expose it and if that's all we do in our<br>lifetime is expose how ugly that system<br>is in the same way that black lives<br>matter is doing with the<br>with the racism all over the world in<br>the imperialist system in the same way<br>that<br>we are doing with our policing when we<br>expose that ugliness that is<br>that that is still um you know a step in<br>and of itself so call it out<br>and have conversations with your<br>community and your family and your flats<br>you know have those active conversations<br>you might not know all the answers and<br>you might not get it right but it's<br>through those corridors that we can<br>actually begin to change so it's about<br>learning it's about using that learning<br>to make conscious decisions<br>it's about making conscious decisions<br>that benefit people outside of yourself<br>it's about building up trust and having<br>connections it's about<br>you know actively being an agent of<br>change means doing all of those tangible<br>things and learning your own whakapapa<br>again think about the sacrifices that<br>your tipuna had<br>to make for you to be here even if it<br>wasn't in the most just<br>socially just way and maybe you know<br>maybe you came over here<br>on a boat and you don't really know<br>exactly why you're here but you know<br>learn about that thing because when you<br>know who you are then you are able to<br>give back because you know who you are<br>and you can acknowledge that<br>you are here because of the sacrifices<br>of people outside of yourself and that<br>in and of itself makes you want to do<br>that's great and and as you say you know<br>those relationships are very much at the<br>heart of<br>um of the titularity framework<br>and but also the way in which we<br>interact day-to-day<br>um in in thinking about how we how we<br>give back in those relationships as well<br>is really important um let's let's go<br>we've got some questions here that have<br>come through so let's<br>let's address some of those um the<br>the first one here is uh<br>how do you propose dealing with those<br>mainly<br>who think the treaty discussions are<br>concerned only with settlements<br>i think it's pretty simple you just put<br>the lay down the numbers like it's<br>pretty clear that the settlement process<br>was a total stitch up when you look at<br>how much of the bloody<br>how much the how much land is worth now<br>and how much has been given to maori<br>um something that a real big flaw that i<br>see with the treaty settlement process<br>is that<br>you know in in wellington we only deal<br>with the ewe that<br>uh we deal with the psges<br>post settlement governance entities um<br>that were here at the signing of the<br>treaty and that process in and of itself<br>is problematic because there's areas<br>within wellington<br>that are significant to other ewe as<br>well so it's<br>showing the deficiencies of that treaty<br>settlement process and how it's just<br>ripped everybody off<br>i think also um the settlement process<br>is primarily concerned with historical<br>grievances<br>and so it's about sort of again<br>challenging those underlying assumptions<br>and saying well actually<br>tertiary um you know as an ongoing<br>relationship it's not something that can<br>be confined to<br>oh yep we did this bad thing to you<br>here's some here's a putia or<br>he's a really small part of the land in<br>which you used to<br>occupy and so<br>you know it's about dispelling those<br>myths and and you know like we said<br>living<br>the values living the values of t um<br>right right yeah and and as you say it's<br>the those historical claims<br>it's about a process of providing some<br>redress for those historical claims but<br>the relationship doesn't end in fact<br>this is it's intended to be<br>the platform for renewing the<br>relationship<br>um so you know that's that's still the<br>the kind of focus there okay<br>um let's just move through the next<br>question here which is<br>as we are becoming more multicultural as<br>a society<br>what is the role of tetris and<br>connecting with<br>um<br>well i think it goes back to values at<br>the end of the day um<br>and the the values that can be set out<br>within a system so<br>i feel like the current system that we<br>have is premised on these<br>artificial borders that we've we've<br>drawn up across the planet that<br>um and we've put in these onerous<br>um kind of processes in which people<br>have to undergo in order to<br>come and call aotearoa home whereas if<br>you had a tt<br>based model you would that's manakitanga<br>when someone comes here<br>because they need a safe place a safe<br>refuge<br>that is unconditional and not only is it<br>unconditional we make<br>people have to jump through hoops to<br>feel safe<br>despite the fact despite the conditions<br>that they have to run away from<br>whereas we should really be the ones<br>that monarchy them so when people are<br>coming over here<br>we should be the ones that are really<br>putting in the aruha and the chewer<br>sense of the word to make sure that they<br>feel safe and that they they start to<br>feel trust so that they can<br>want to become a part of our society so<br>i feel like<br>our immigration processes are rigid and<br>cold<br>and very clinical in and of themselves<br>and so<br>at a titan-based way to look at<br>immigration<br>is that it's about manakitanga and how<br>can we embed that<br>in a process that makes sure that people<br>feel safe and make sure that when they<br>come over here that they can continue to<br>apply<br>the skills or the things that they're<br>passionate about that they<br>um want to do and contribute to our<br>society um<br>when they are ready and able to and keen<br>to so<br>yeah i think that that that's the role<br>is that we need to make that process<br>easy so that people who come over here<br>feel safe again and we do what we can<br>in order to advocate if if the the<br>situations or circumstances in their<br>home countries<br>um are terrible we want we want them to<br>we want to be able to<br>um to provide them<br>with a with a platform and the ability<br>to be able to advocate for the things<br>that they care about<br>and um and give them a safe space<br>as well so yeah and i think the the<br>the inclusive nature of tt means that<br>everyone can<br>practice and celebrate their culture or<br>their religion in aotearoa<br>without fear of discrimination or<br>harassment or harm<br>and it's about actively creating those<br>spaces where people feel that they can<br>be themselves and where they can express<br>their cultures<br>and i think a massive challenge for us<br>coming up soon with climate change is<br>that<br>you know we are facing a ginormous<br>um and almost<br>incomprehensible situation and that as<br>the pacific<br>sinks how do we create actively create a<br>space for our<br>pacific whanau to be able to come here<br>should they want to and to be able to<br>preserve<br>their culture for forever<br>for for all of their udi for all of the<br>people that come after them and so<br>that's a massive conversation that we<br>have and the current system that we have<br>that says<br>that um western culture is supreme um or<br>kiwi culture whatever that is um that's<br>something that needs to be<br>really stamped out immediately we need<br>to think about what our collective<br>identity is and our culture is but we<br>can only begin to identify that when we<br>know who we are and that goes back to<br>understanding your own whakapapa and<br>where you come from what brings you here<br>and then what brings us all together<br>which is the foundational documents<br>those are documents that uh they make<br>who we are so it's about connecting with<br>who we are<br>um and being able to make space for<br>people to be able to come here and to be<br>able to preserve their cultures practice<br>them safely<br>and to feel safe and included in a<br>meaningful<br>um next question i've got here is<br>what do you think the role of pakiha is<br>in this<br>aotearoa transformation and perhaps<br>constitutional transformation more<br>specifically and are we losing<br>rihanna thanks<br>rihanna awesome to have you as part of<br>everyone thank you i just have to um go<br>back<br>and hear the results of my mood so aroha<br>mai but i look forward um to the<br>recording<br>and you can flick us all the email<br>well<br>this might be another question for you<br>um so what do you think the role of<br>pakiha is<br>in this aotearoa transformation and<br>perhaps constitutional transformation<br>more specifically<br>um so i think it's there um needs to be<br>an acknowledgement that pakia do make up<br>a majority of<br>new zealanders and therefore you have<br>the power and the potential to really<br>drive this conversation and make it<br>relevant to your whanau<br>to your community and um yeah i think<br>it's it's tricky though because um<br>something that i get is that there's a<br>bit of a discomfort there because<br>a lot of pakia they want to help but<br>they don't want to take up too much<br>space<br>i think the most the most powerful way<br>that you can be helpful<br>is that um it's it's again goes back to<br>what i'm saying before<br>recognizing and identifying what you are<br>what you're passionate about what drives<br>you no matter what area of society that<br>is<br>within and then really learning with all<br>of the abundant resources that we have<br>at our fingertips with the internet but<br>also with those connections that you<br>build up<br>through trust through that um once you<br>have that understanding<br>applying that to all the decisions you<br>make within whichever area that you're<br>in applying those<br>actively as the first you know in an<br>individual capacity that's the first way<br>that<br>um you can help us get towards<br>constitutional transformation<br>but i think the most important way that<br>you can help as well is to<br>um have those conversations in your<br>community<br>if you begin to have those conversations<br>even if the people you're talking to<br>don't necessarily agree with you<br>that's taking away some labor that a<br>person of color or<br>a maori person has to have with with<br>those communities so<br>yeah and i think conversations are<br>really<br>potent in that they uh<br>in a world of um and i saying this other<br>day in our in our other workshop<br>on yesterday um in a world where there<br>is a lot of information out there<br>especially with the internet<br>i think it's really hard for people to<br>distinguish what is true and what isn't<br>um and so a lot of us nowadays we rely<br>on the opinions of our friends and our<br>family and the people that we love and<br>we trust<br>and so that is a really under utilized<br>tool for change<br>you know have a potluck at your house if<br>you flat<br>you know get your flatmates together and<br>and have dinner together and talk about<br>um any issue that you care about and how<br>tetris is relevant to that<br>um especially with an election coming up<br>if you live if you're if you're a<br>professional and you live in a i guess<br>like a middle class neighborhood or<br>something like that<br>have a community potluck get get get<br>your neighbors around to your house and<br>and have a corridor with them about yeah<br>the upcoming election or or<br>the referenda or or a relevant issue and<br>and really<br>just have a really safe and inclusive<br>corridor about what that means so it's<br>about actively talking about<br>actively talking about these things<br>taking some of that labor<br>away from um other groups of people<br>and um really making your day-to-day<br>decisions<br>in your job so professionally and<br>personally being able to strain those<br>through a<br>tetris lens i think is a really<br>important way that you can<br>um you can be helpful if you're pakia<br>and<br>want to help realize constitutional<br>transformation in<br>nz yeah that's great<br>and and i think that partly addresses to<br>one of the other questions that we've<br>got here which was thinking about<br>um whether we have any thoughts about<br>how pakia might work towards a more kind<br>of grounded understanding of the role of<br>tetris<br>and there's another comment there that<br>someone's added around<br>um which i think is is kind of<br>addressing partly the role that you<br>talked about about<br>thinking about how to have those safe<br>conversations thinking about<br>how to take some of the labor off from<br>maori in<br>in and having those conversations as<br>well<br>and i mean i guess just picking up on<br>some of the other things we've talked<br>about tonight too<br>that one of the things that i think is a<br>really important thing for<br>um for all of us to do but but i think<br>it<br>can be really helpful for parkour as<br>well as to to<br>um to find out about their whakapapa and<br>their connection to this place<br>as you mentioned earlier tam because<br>that that then gives you a<br>that gives you those connections that<br>gives you a point of reference to<br>think about how to engage with that<br>conversation um<br>and so i think that that's also really<br>important<br>hard out um should i jump to the oh<br>sorry<br>um what role can non-maori play in the<br>creation of systems which are by maori<br>and for maori<br>you can answer that one cowan well<br>it's a little bit like you you were just<br>talking about in the sense that<br>um the thing that the thing that<br>non-maori can do<br>there is to think about<br>what is the work that you know what are<br>the issues that i'm engaged with what<br>are the conversations that i'm having<br>how do i bring them how do i support um<br>maori to be in those spaces or to have<br>those conversations<br>um you know one of the things that that<br>we talked about a lot in our<br>um and the work that we did with the<br>justice advisory group<br>was that the thing that's going to<br>really make the change<br>is that will make politicians make the<br>change<br>is when they see that there is<br>popular support for something when when<br>people are uh pushing this is an issue<br>and that as you again you mentioned<br>before<br>it's one of the things that pacquiao can<br>be really helpful with because they are<br>a majority um and so have<br>a a different kind of political voice<br>and can speak to to different kinds of<br>constituencies as well<br>so it's really about reflecting on um<br>you know partly what space am i taking<br>out um<br>reflecting on how can i um<br>support maori how can i support things<br>that are maori lead<br>um in in um<br>to because of course the the essence of<br>by maori for maori is that those those<br>things are<br>mildly lead 100<br>and i think yeah just even that that<br>word creation like<br>i think that's the the other thing that<br>um is really<br>key is that it's less creating the<br>systems and more reconnecting with them<br>because i think that's the really key<br>yeah the really key point here is that<br>we<br>colonization has really done a number on<br>our memory<br>and um the way that we can connect with<br>um any any solution that we<br>wish to find it's about again honing our<br>memories and being able to<br>um re-identify what those are and so<br>in terms of the creation of systems all<br>of us can benefit from going back and<br>actually learning about<br>um what those systems might have been<br>and i've been doing that a lot with the<br>different kaupapa that i'm um<br>interested in i'm thinking i'm i'm going<br>and reading books and resources about<br>um what were the traditional or<br>indigenous ways that um<br>we dealt with a particular issue and if<br>we haven't done that then<br>um i'm sure our you know alfano in the<br>pacific has found a way to deal with it<br>and if not<br>there might be some hints around the<br>world um with other indigenous<br>communities to find these solutions so<br>yeah i think we prop up these new um<br>ideas a lot too you know we say oh my<br>gosh look at that um<br>especially in the way that we um look at<br>like um<br>looking at things like regenerative<br>agriculture and stuff we prop up these<br>new ways of<br>doing all of these things however if we<br>take a step back we can find that<br>there's actually a lot simpler ways to<br>do things that<br>are natural to alter and will work<br>because they have worked before so<br>it's about reconnecting with those and<br>everybody can do that you know<br>the internet again is a free tool for<br>most people if you're able to access it<br>so if you're able to<br>just reconnect with those methods and<br>learn about those and obviously don't<br>maybe don't explain to<br>a maori person that system you know just<br>say oh i i<br>i saw this thing like maybe this could<br>work you know just don't yeah don't do<br>that<br>but um yeah i think that's pretty much<br>yeah and i see i see someone<br>um in the q a part has also<br>added a link to some uh resources and<br>as you're saying tim there's there's<br>plenty of resources available<br>and you know one of the things that<br>people might want to do is to think<br>about<br>seeking out um things to read or listen<br>to or<br>engage with um on the internet as well<br>um just the one probably last question<br>that we might deal with<br>um is a question about<br>and change to systems and thinking and<br>whether um we think that the common law<br>or the courts could be an effective<br>path for change um and there's a<br>reference to the<br>peter ellis appeal um i might just<br>address the<br>the kind of specific common law courts<br>part but i think there's a broader<br>question there tam about<br>um thinking about the as you've talked<br>about the kind of westminster system<br>that we're based on so we might just<br>come back i'll come back to you in a<br>minute<br>but there's a really interesting issue<br>coming through<br>uh the courts at the moment the supreme<br>court is in them has heard<br>uh the the appeal of peter ellis um<br>some of you might be familiar with this<br>case it was a high profile case goes<br>back to the 1990s and number of<br>convictions that peter ellis had<br>um now he had been through a number of<br>appeals<br>and last year he was the supreme court<br>had<br>granted him leave to appeal to the<br>supreme court<br>and but before the hearing was held<br>peter ellis died<br>and then the question became should the<br>appeal continue given that the person<br>who was appealing had died<br>and the kind of common law assumption<br>was well<br>um no that's that's the end of the<br>matter there's no<br>more issue for us to determine but what<br>was<br>when they they came here and got to the<br>supreme court<br>uh a couple of the judges started asking<br>questions<br>about does tikanga maori have anything<br>to say about this<br>um you know if if we're thinking of<br>tikanga as part of<br>our foundational system of law is<br>contributing to<br>the new zealand common law as distinct<br>from the english common law<br>should we be considering questions of<br>tikanga and so there's just recently<br>the court have heard those issues around<br>tikanga<br>and have have been beginning to address<br>um thinking we don't know what the<br>decision will be yet<br>but but certainly interested in those<br>questions around<br>you know does tikanga maori say<br>something different<br>to what the assumptions of the english<br>common law is<br>and if so should new zealand common law<br>carve out a new path<br>so there are some really interesting<br>moves afoot there<br>and it does have the potential to quite<br>fundamentally shape our new zealand<br>legal system<br>but i think that you know there are<br>still some real limitations around<br>how the new zealand state legal system<br>operates<br>and so i think there are questions<br>around what are the constraints and the<br>parameters on that<br>um and does it get to the kind of<br>structural change that we've been<br>talking about<br>so i'll hand over to you for any more<br>thoughts about structural change<br>tim um to be honest i don't have much to<br>add<br>because um i think yeah no you just yep<br>that was<br>excellent um i guess it's really like<br>from<br>an outside perspective um it's really<br>that it's really i find it really<br>inspiring the kind of creative ways in<br>which um<br>people are coming up with ways to work<br>within the current systems to find<br>creative solutions to<br>get to re-indigenizing so for example at<br>council you know we are subject to<br>different like national policy<br>statements and<br>so i've seen um i've seen<br>i think i caught the end of the national<br>policy statement on fresh water<br>management which um<br>outlined tim manuel ty and then<br>obviously that's being used as a<br>successful tool and the environmental<br>court<br>um held i think it was i don't i don't<br>know the specifics don't<br>you law students don't you call me out<br>on this because i don't know but like<br>um the way that they<br>i think it was an eewee down south or<br>hapu down south<br>um held held like a local body<br>accountable for<br>polluting a waterway and they use the<br>concept of terminology<br>as a um as a as their legal foundation<br>in one<br>and then with this new another national<br>policy statement that's come through<br>late last year which is around<br>protecting native<br>um biodiversity so our indigenous trees<br>and<br>birds and bugs and all that um<br>and that concept is called hutia<br>territor and that's similar in that it<br>gives it it gives i don't know the right<br>terminology but it gives some kind of a<br>legal expression or grounds to protect<br>um these different<br>you know elements in a way<br>that is i guess premised around te<br>kangar it might not be perfect but um<br>you know we're finding these creative<br>ways to work within the system to<br>um create that change and then there's<br>the obvious ones like the legal<br>uh legal personhood of um yeah um the<br>wanganui river as you talked about<br>cohen um and um<br>of you know te urueta and all of those<br>kind of cool<br>um creative ways to entwine<br>um different concepts um<br>but yeah so like obviously that's not<br>gonna be the thing that helps but<br>in the meantime i think finding those<br>creative ways and learning about those<br>um<br>those creative and indigenous concepts<br>and the way that they're being used um<br>to hold these systems to account i think<br>is um<br>as is all i'd really add to that<br>yeah absolutely um i think we might um<br>we're out of time um so we might bring<br>things to a close<br>um i just wanted to in closing to<br>we talked about matariki uh at the very<br>beginning<br>and just again want to encourage people<br>to think about some of those<br>those ideas around reflection um<br>around then thinking about innovation<br>and then planning for how you're going<br>to make those changes and that<br>innovation<br>and so in um tam and rihanna both<br>talked about the ways in which you might<br>think about<br>um kind of embedding te tariti<br>in a to te turiti lens in your kind of<br>daily life and whatever activities<br>you're involved in whatever the issues<br>are that interest you<br>whatever conversations you might be<br>having with people so think about<br>whether you know what conversations are<br>you going to have what steps you're<br>going to take what resources are you<br>going to seek out<br>to to kind of develop and innovate<br>um as we move through this time of<br>matariki<br>so i'll close in a moment with um<br>karakia but just<br>first i really wanted to thank<br>uh my co-facilitators<br>um tam who's still here um and rihanna<br>of course who<br>was able to join us and make the<br>contributions that she did<br>really a real pleasure being part of the<br>session with<br>uh both you two and also just to thank<br>the uh the folks uh who have organized<br>this<br>leadership week in the different<br>sessions that that<br>have been taking place that this is part<br>of<br>um and of course everyone who's joined<br>in been participating tonight<br>asking some great questions there to<br>move the discussion along and<br>really demonstrating the kind of engaged<br>thinking that that is really helpful for<br>progressing these kinds of issues and<br>conversations<br>so and i'll just um<br>m</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
