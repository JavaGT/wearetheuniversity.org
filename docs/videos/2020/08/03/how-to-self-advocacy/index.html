Marginalized communities throughout history- black communities, disabled communities, the LGBTQ community, women, etc- have only gained rights through activism and civil struggle. In today’s world, nothing is given without it being demanded.<br><br>At this panel, which was hosted by the Disabled Students Association at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, we aimed to give attendees the knowledge and skills they need to demand their rights are met with a particular focus on the education and workplace environment. Tune in, learn about the history of the disabled rights movement in New Zealand, and develop the confidence to be your own biggest advocate.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

thought we'd start with just a<br>bit of admin to get that out of the way<br>um for those of you who are interested<br>in accurate transcript<br>of this conversation will be made<br>available afterwards<br>and there's also live transcribing for<br>those who need it so hopefully<br>you've um been gotten in touch with<br>about that<br>um if we're speaking too quickly or you<br>can't hear us please let us know either<br>in the chat function or in the little<br>raise hand button<br>and that will also be used for questions<br>towards the end of our session<br>and i think blake and charlie are here<br>to<br>help us out with all that side of things<br>cool so let's get that out of the way um<br>kyota koto katoa my name is alice<br>and i'm lucky enough to be the leader of<br>the disabled students association here<br>at tejeda norwalka<br>i'm also a law and arts student majoring<br>in film studies and sociology<br>i'm going to be around here at uni for<br>quite a few more years<br>so you'll see me around a lot if you're<br>still here as well<br>so a lot of my time in energy is<br>dedicated to disability rights and i've<br>been lucky enough to work alongside<br>other organizations such as attitude<br>pictures all this for all and imagine<br>better<br>in my um past so yeah for those of us<br>who do not know much about<br>the disabled students association i<br>thought it may as well<br>tell you a little bit about it so we're<br>the representative group for students<br>with disabilities and impairments on<br>campus<br>we run events such as this give advice<br>from the perspective of disabled<br>students and also seek to create a<br>really warm and welcoming environment<br>for all disabled students<br>our organization has very rich history<br>which is kind of<br>the inspiration for this topic today<br>because as some of<br>you some of you may know us sorry by our<br>former name can do<br>um candor was actually established in<br>1992<br>and stands for campus abilities and<br>disabilities organization<br>so it was through the advocacy and work<br>of can do that a separate service for<br>students with disabilities was created<br>on campus which eventually became what<br>we know as disability services today<br>so we recently changed our name to the<br>disabled students association<br>but we believe it encompasses our<br>organization's current co-property in a<br>way that is more relevant to students<br>today<br>so we want to reclaim the use of the<br>word disabled and encourage<br>but the story of can do and its history<br>is still extremely relevant for today's<br>conversation<br>and for our group so without the<br>dedicated and brave advocacy<br>of students back in 1992 disability<br>services<br>and victoria university as we know it<br>may not have actually come into fruition<br>so i think this is an example of how the<br>rights we enjoy today not just as<br>students but as citizens<br>are often taken for granted and they do<br>in fact come through direct advocacy<br>from the people who<br>use them the most and i think this is<br>true throughout history so<br>maori communities disabled communities<br>the lgbtq<br>community they've only gained rights<br>unfortunately through activism and civil<br>struggle<br>i think it's the sad reality of the<br>neoliberal society that we live in<br>and nothing is actually given without it<br>being demanded<br>so the pertinent question that we're<br>here to discuss today is how we actually<br>affect the change we wish to see<br>for the future and to discuss this exact<br>topic we have invited an incredible<br>group of people<br>along to chat each of you have<br>contributed to community advocacy and<br>activism in one way or another<br>and have been super important role<br>models for me myself personally<br>and so we will be discussing and<br>learning from their experiences<br>of getting involved in adverse advocacy<br>and hopefully come away with the<br>knowledge and confidence<br>to believe that everyone has the power<br>to activate change<br>so without further ado i'm privileged to<br>introduce our panelists today<br>let's get it around um maybe we have<br>party umanga<br>but if he wants to maybe just unmute<br>good everyone it's nice to be here uh<br>and jala tran lawrence good everyone<br>it's lovely to see you<br>awesome so before we launch into some<br>questions that are prepared there'll<br>also be room at the end for<br>questions from everyone else i would<br>absolutely love it if all our awesome<br>panelists could please introduce<br>yourself and maybe tell us a little bit<br>about<br>your journey to getting where you are<br>today and specifically how you got into<br>the various<br>forms of advocacy work you're all in uh<br>party i thought maybe if you would like<br>sure um sorry i<br>i need to apologize for this because i'm<br>sitting in my van in a car park<br>so i can get to my next appointment and<br>the parking waters just walk past you<br>and finger point his finger at me so<br>i'm not sure what's happening here i<br>just missed that last part of your<br>question ellis sorry<br>oh yes um i was just wondering whether<br>you could tell us about your journey<br>to getting where you are today and also<br>how you got to the various forms of<br>advocacy work that you would<br>do at the moment sure okay well<br>i've always had a background in<br>community development i've done a lot of<br>youth work in the past with street kids<br>and and i guess i've had a sense of<br>social justice from those days although<br>i suspect it began earlier<br>um but i wasn't aware of<br>issues around social justice social<br>change<br>and human rights basically and um<br>during that time also got involved in um<br>maori sovereignty issues uh for a woman<br>uh donna awa tere who was leading a<br>maori sovereignty movement at the time<br>and also<br>got involved in the springbok tour<br>protest<br>back in 81 so back in those days i was a<br>walker<br>and it wasn't until 2005 that<br>when i had an accident in henna 4 broke<br>my neck and i've been in a wheelchair<br>ever since so<br>it's my 15th year anniversary this year<br>going back to the past for me to<br>kind of recognize the future and what i<br>mean by that is that i knew that<br>um in terms of hitting myself<br>and kind of getting to a point where i<br>could affect social change from<br>a disability perspective and being<br>involved in the disability scene<br>that i wanted to try and um see if i can<br>do the same kind of change that i had<br>back in my days of<br>as a youth worker so um i got involved<br>in a lot of mainstream<br>issues i wanted to find out what the lay<br>of the land looked like for our pacific<br>disabled people<br>and to be honest i was quite<br>disappointed i think the traditional<br>method of<br>trying to talk to government agencies<br>around developing strategies and<br>policies<br>and trying to effect change from that<br>level<br>it doesn't always hit the mark and so<br>for me<br>i tried other avenues of<br>activism as such and what i<br>got into was music and i wanted to use<br>music as a way of<br>challenging not just<br>traditional kind of stereotypes towards<br>people with disabilities<br>but also how we could find an innovative<br>way of<br>i guess protesting<br>advocating activism and for me<br>i know the love of young people that i<br>was dealing with<br>they found the traditional way of trying<br>to do change of<br>having forums um meetings<br>and kind of all these advisory groups<br>was quite boring<br>and it used a lot of bureaucratic<br>speaking so for me<br>i think some of the change needs to come<br>from the grassroots in the arts<br>and music is one way that i think it<br>could happen so<br>that's what i've been doing is trying to<br>develop music to try and<br>um find another avenue for our people to<br>kia ora thanks for that yeah i think<br>your story is super<br>interesting and i totally agree that a<br>lot of young people<br>are put off by the bureaucracy of some<br>of this policy level things<br>i know personally it can be a bit of a<br>drag sometimes<br>um great cool laura would you like to<br>kick us off next sure um<br>yeah so uh my journey to activism and<br>and um and throughout activism has been<br>um sort of like like this if you imagine<br>the line<br>being this curly line that goes sort of<br>up and down<br>um because i have experimented with many<br>different ways to try and make change so<br>um i came to<br>i came to working in the ngo sector<br>actually because i<br>moved to england um after high school<br>because i didn't really know what i<br>wanted to do but i did know that i loved<br>music festivals<br>and i wanted to work on music festivals<br>and i wanted to<br>learn about how i could um bring awesome<br>music festivals to new zealand and i<br>figured<br>we're better to go and learn how to do<br>that than glastonbury um in the uk<br>and so that's what i did and so i moved<br>to england um and i got a job as a<br>volunteer coordinator at<br>these music festivals that have like 50<br>16 nowadays they have like 200 000<br>people<br>but really big music festivals and my<br>job was to organize the<br>waste and recycling volunteers so it's<br>the volunteers that would go and pick up<br>rubbish basically and make sure that<br>people were putting things in the right<br>bins and the compost bins etc etc<br>which actually is a pretty huge job when<br>there's like 60 000 people at a festival<br>um and the way that the model worked is<br>that oxfam<br>would be paid by glastonbury to provide<br>say 200 or 400<br>volunteers and the volunteers would get<br>a free ticket as long as they were<br>say eight to 16 hours over the duration<br>of the festival<br>um and so it meant that volunteers got<br>to come for free<br>they got to volunteer for a good cause<br>oxfam got money and glastonbury got<br>i've got volunteers and so it works<br>really well for everyone involved<br>um and uh and so that was sort of my<br>first introduction into like<br>um the way that you can think creatively<br>about how you<br>make the most of everyone's talents to<br>create change<br>um but what also happened is that when i<br>was living in england i happened to be<br>there when they were having an election<br>and i was asking my friends who were<br>activists and artists and things like<br>that who are you planning to vote for in<br>the election<br>um and most of them would say i'm not<br>going to vote because it doesn't make a<br>difference<br>and i found that really interesting<br>because from my perspective i've always<br>been like<br>we need to use all of the tools in our<br>kite for creating change<br>and um yes a vote is not everything but<br>it is one part of<br>all the things that we can do to bring<br>forth the world that we want to see<br>and so when i came back to aotearoa in<br>2014 or 2013<br>i decided to look into the statistics to<br>see if um<br>to see if young people were voting in<br>low numbers in in this country as well<br>and i found out that was the case<br>and so i um along with my flatmates and<br>friends started an organization called<br>rock and roll<br>which was basically we would organize a<br>bunch of parties all around the country<br>where anyone um could get a ticket as<br>long as they<br>enrolled and made a promise to vote we<br>weren't trying to get them to vote for<br>any particular party we were just trying<br>to get people<br>started with the voting habit um because<br>research shows if you start<br>young then you'll continue voting for<br>the rest of your life and so what we<br>would do is we would call<br>every single one of the people who came<br>to one of our gigs which ended up being<br>about 3 000 people all around the<br>country in 2014<br>to be like hey where are you voting like<br>do you need any help with that<br>um what's the issue that you're<br>passionate about so it's sort of a<br>mixture of parties and political<br>organizing<br>um and um and then<br>and then when i was running rock and<br>roll which was mostly powered by<br>volunteers<br>and what i would call sweat equity um so<br>like a lot of volunteer hours<br>and a lot of hard work um i heard about<br>this organization called action station<br>that was being brought to new zealand<br>which was basically about<br>um bringing people power back to<br>democracy um<br>because the co-founders had found the<br>limit of what you could achieve in terms<br>of creating change<br>within the parliamentary political<br>system and so they wanted to create<br>something outside of that for anyone<br>to take action on the issues that they<br>care about and so i heard about this and<br>i was like that sounds like what i<br>should be doing and i just emailed<br>the co-founders again and again and<br>again with um campaign ideas until they<br>hired me basically<br>um and so now i've been at action<br>awesome thanks for that i think politics<br>and parties sound like<br>things that young people can get behind<br>i hope<br>um cool jala you're up next i think<br>would you like to go<br>thanks alice go to everybody uh i'm<br>jolla<br>i um i joke that i only really got into<br>the space<br>uh of activism i particularly am<br>involved in like feminist and sexual<br>violence prevention activism<br>um in the past few years however when i<br>say that<br>people who have known me since i was a<br>kid say no you were always like this<br>you'll be just<br>signed a little ball of rage you tried<br>to fight everybody um<br>so you know i don't know who's right um<br>i<br>started um kind of understanding more<br>about these issues when i was an<br>undergrad<br>and taking some criminology papers um<br>that looked at<br>sexual violence and violence against<br>women and that kind of<br>sparked a passion i suppose and i've<br>been in this space ever since so i and<br>then i<br>came back to new zealand after i took an<br>oe um<br>and i went back into my honors degree in<br>criminology and specifically looked<br>at around sexual violence and<br>masculinity<br>and prevention initiatives and and men<br>and that kind of thing<br>um and during that year it's actually<br>when i met alice and i<br>i was helping out as the co-president of<br>the feminist organization<br>and then i also was the president of the<br>citizen black the uw<br>organization which is a tertiary-based<br>sexual violence prevention campaign<br>um and i also work<br>as a youth educator for um respected<br>or who are formerly the sexual abuse<br>prevention network um so i go into high<br>schools<br>and teach around facilitate around<br>consent and sexual violence and gender<br>and sexuality and that kind of thing<br>i've actually just walked in for my<br>class<br>um talking to you 10 boys about consent<br>which was just amazing and i loved it<br>um so and then i also<br>began tutoring for the university around<br>sexual violence and human trafficking<br>um and so since then i finished my<br>honours and i've done my masters in a<br>similar subject around<br>men's perceptions of sexual violence and<br>rap culture and i<br>am now the national coordinator for that<br>physicist and black campaign<br>and do various bits and pieces as all of<br>us know we tend to<br>you know volunteer and have our fingers<br>in mini pies<br>um so yeah i suppose that's me and my<br>kind of driving force behind this is<br>just um<br>looking and seeing the power of young<br>people i think young people are just<br>phenomenal<br>and really trying to push<br>intersectionality at the forefront of<br>everything i do<br>um to try and combat some of those you<br>know<br>old age traditional views of what<br>feminism is<br>um and yeah just make change in that<br>area i hope that answers<br>your little intro question thanks yeah<br>awesome thanks that was great<br>um cool and then last but not least whoa<br>would you like to go<br>never least i think um i might be short<br>but everyone seems to be able to find me<br>in a crowd to try and avoid me but<br>killed everybody my name's huhana doctor<br>who's for short i always say the only<br>reason i got my phd<br>was so that i could legitimately be the<br>first female doctor who<br>and then they go and make her blond head<br>and blue eyed so they definitely<br>don't know me at all um i am a huge<br>sci-fi fan i love<br>i love doctor who i love um and i love<br>star trek i do not like star wars that's<br>an action not real sci-fi<br>but that's me um so you don't go on<br>hating me because you love star wars<br>it's just different genre<br>um but for me i guess i don't think of<br>myself as an activist<br>it's a term that's a very powerful term<br>i just happen to live my truth and i've<br>had to fight from birth so i had to<br>fight to live<br>i had to fight against after i was<br>adopted by<br>a transracially adopted i had to fight<br>against my daughter's uncle<br>from the age of three i had to fight my<br>adoptive mum's alcoholism<br>depression from an early age and i had<br>to fight a lot of abuse<br>so a lot of my early life was one of<br>anger<br>one of being abused one of being worked<br>over worked around<br>had a lot of labels placed on my<br>adoption papers had me listed as<br>an imbecile and an idiot and i may very<br>well be both i mean some people do call<br>me idiots at times and some call me a<br>bit of an imbecile but<br>you know what i don't think you can<br>predict that in a baby but<br>they apparently did so i was never<br>expected to achieve anything<br>so let's just say i was expected to just<br>get married had kids<br>even the nuns at the catholic school<br>when i said i wanted to be a nun because<br>i was terrified of the idea of getting<br>married<br>um they just laughed at me and said no<br>you'll only ever be any good to be a<br>housewife and a mother and that<br>depressed the hell out of me<br>as though there was something bad about<br>being a mother but it was<br>more the fact that that was what they<br>thought i would do and<br>i know the generation that we weren't<br>told that we could do anything we wanted<br>you know i had a real fascination for<br>biology anatomy<br>physiology i think i would have made a<br>great doctor but i was never headed that<br>way and it wasn't until<br>uh my disabilities started to sort of<br>show themselves i was doing nursing<br>training<br>here the department said oh you're not<br>very bright who and so okay<br>got into uni the first year i got in i<br>had three a's<br>two b's and eight operations that year<br>one was a hysterectomy and i still got<br>three astbs i was a solo mum<br>raising a disabled child myself with my<br>own disabilities and realised i had a<br>brain<br>so uni kind of gave me that that first<br>year i was there<br>all of a sudden i became the vice<br>president of the student union<br>because the president died and this is<br>someone who'd never been guided<br>really around politics whatever i went<br>to the springbok tour<br>protest too but i went with my older<br>educated cousins<br>and i didn't know really why i was there<br>but i was busy on one side and my<br>doctor's bird was waving at me on the<br>other side as he went to the rugby games<br>and i guess in some ways he was the one<br>though that taught me<br>that he didn't care he was a national<br>rabid national follower loved muldoon<br>all of that<br>so at the age of 14 he took me to go and<br>see muldoon and he was walking down the<br>aisle of the old opera house in new<br>plymouth<br>and i looked at him looked at my father<br>and i said he's a bloody short man isn't<br>he dead<br>and it put politics in perspective that<br>day from that day on dad said to me i<br>don't care who you vote for<br>the important thing is that you vote and<br>so from that day on i said well that's<br>great because i'm never voting for them<br>and um i went and exercised my vote my<br>own son i told him the same thing<br>he was the first in the door on the year<br>he could vote to vote<br>and so i learned then that there's one<br>way you can have a voice<br>especially when you are in the world of<br>being one of those ones that they<br>marginalize<br>that they put down or put away the only<br>thing i've got<br>is my ability to vote and that's it and<br>the power in voting<br>and i've seen that power when we've<br>collectively gotten together and done it<br>we've done it with some<br>uh for sure and seabed 20 000 protested<br>i couldn't go<br>so i supported the students back at the<br>university while they went and we made<br>sure they had all their notes and<br>everything else so<br>i guess i don't really think about my<br>activism<br>i just know i do what i need to do in<br>order to do what we need to do to get to<br>where we need to get<br>and sometimes you succeed sometimes you<br>fail<br>but the key point is if you're going to<br>make a stand for something and one of<br>the things i don't understand about our<br>disability community and i'll be<br>honest why the heck are we so weak<br>on standing up on issues i have stood by<br>myself in rp square with placards<br>because a woman was trapped upstairs for<br>three years because the ministry took<br>away her list and refused to replace<br>it i have stood um face to face with<br>people<br>spitting in my face while i've well not<br>stood i've sat there in my wheelchair<br>while they get abusive<br>because of what i believe and i will die<br>for what i believe and i don't hesitate<br>in saying that because i'm not afraid<br>but when i've had to advocate for my<br>community most of them won't speak out<br>don't want to be identified because<br>they're afraid<br>and society has made disabled people in<br>particular<br>afraid afraid to speak out oh you're<br>going to lose your services<br>if you speak out like those we're gonna<br>cut your hours<br>and for a lot of disabled that's<br>terrifying the problem is<br>they're not meeting our needs now so how<br>do you think by staying silent<br>and by not speaking up that you're going<br>to win so i've started a new campaign<br>because i believe now 20 years ago i got<br>told by ruth dyson that it will never<br>happen<br>so there was my will to tell her get<br>stuff that will happen<br>and it's taken me 23 years so far but my<br>new campaign now is to push for a<br>ministry for disabilities<br>and a disabilities act to be led by<br>disabled<br>for disabled and about disabled i sit on<br>the human rights review tribunal how<br>come none of you when we have a bulk of<br>complaints<br>none of you come to the tribunal to be<br>heard<br>if you're not happy with the complaints<br>you can take it further we don't charge<br>you<br>it's free we say to our chairperson has<br>made it very clear<br>if an individual loses the case it<br>doesn't matter if they're disabled we<br>won't charge them<br>unless they're a vexatious litigator<br>which means they just come with all<br>sorts of rubbish cases<br>but generally we will not charge because<br>it needs to be heard the tribunal needs<br>to hear<br>the argument i won't go on much longer i<br>identify as maori i'm also sami navajo<br>and aboriginal so i'm from before wins<br>the<br>other thing here is that the predominant<br>voices in our sector<br>voices they're not maori they're not<br>migrants<br>they're not even really a lot of men in<br>leadership it's mostly women<br>mostly pakiha and there's nothing<br>against that but we are a diverse<br>community<br>my grandson is half filipino my youngest<br>son is half caribbean<br>and i believe in diversity we share the<br>love in our whanau<br>we've got bulk of it so when you're<br>looking at activism when you're looking<br>at your voice and finding your voice<br>you need to direct yourself but you also<br>need to look after yourself too<br>you're no good to anybody if you get<br>sick<br>you have got to look after yourself and<br>one of those things is my passion<br>and puffy i i you know i remember the<br>old holiday makers<br>a great band and um but you know music's<br>my passion as well i sing soul gospel<br>jazz and that's my passion i'm losing my<br>voice but until i do i sing<br>i also do artwork i've just finished the<br>cartoon of um<br>david seymour for a community that want<br>it and um<br>that will be going out i love sculpture<br>cartoon<br>i love cooking i'm a foodie um you know<br>we are all that<br>we're not just our political persons we<br>are also<br>a mother a wife a partner you know<br>we're we're all sorts of people we're<br>children of<br>parents of grandparents of and we need<br>to be able to celebrate all of that<br>but to do that we're going to have to<br>get loud guys because we are behind<br>the rest of the kiwis in new zealand to<br>get<br>ourselves heard and if we keep staying<br>silent and you get into your job and<br>your government job and they start to<br>gag you<br>just remember that's another voice lost<br>in the activism<br>world around disability and every voice<br>here<br>yeah that was super inspiring thank you<br>for that um<br>yeah i totally agree with everything<br>that you said and<br>the just the importance of speaking out<br>and knowing when to take space and make<br>spaces<br>something that i know i think about a<br>lot um<br>cool so i'm sorry to bring it back to<br>you um but<br>um you kind of touched on a little bit<br>but i thought um<br>so for those who don't know as someone<br>you have a background in human rights<br>law being the inaugural solicitor<br>at auckland disability law um<br>so i was wondering whether you could<br>speak to the main barriers that you<br>perceive and people exercising the<br>rights that we have under the law<br>because i think that from my<br>understanding the big thing<br>with um demanding your rights is that<br>you can't demand that which you don't<br>know actually exists<br>and i think when it comes to human<br>rights there are some breaches in<br>aotearoa that simply go unnoticed i'm<br>thinking like the wages<br>exemption policy for disabled people and<br>many others so<br>it's a big question but um i was<br>wondering whether you could yeah<br>talk to why you think that is and how we<br>can<br>get over that barry and try to bring<br>more awareness to what rights<br>we have and then how we can exercise<br>them<br>we're very polite people kiwis i really<br>envy the international activist movement<br>of the disabilities<br>overseas i mean they chain themselves to<br>date for goodness sake i die<br>of the day when i can chain myself for<br>something um people say well why<br>are we so behind in our activism well i<br>remind them rosa parks<br>really led a big movement that grew when<br>she refused to move on the bus<br>we can't even get on the bus to begin<br>with so we get missed as the bus goes by<br>because it's not accessible to us<br>what we should be doing is chaining<br>ourselves to the bus<br>and then stopping them from going<br>further without us and so that requires<br>that we need more and more of you<br>to look at standing for the different<br>political parties and to be demanding<br>not to get back on the list at number 54<br>but for higher placements it is<br>absolutely<br>patronizing paternalistic that<br>we have our<br>our disabled candidates so far down the<br>list<br>that they can say oh we've got the<br>disabled candidate<br>but you know that number 54 you know you<br>just vote for us<br>and then they've got a chance well<br>they've got no show in hell<br>and we've had a lot of people stand and<br>we had mojo for one term<br>and then they put us so far down the<br>list that they basically<br>um they they insulted the rest of us<br>one of the issues coming through<br>parliament right now is the euthanasia<br>debate and you know the disability voice<br>has been ignored<br>it's not heard and i know not everyone<br>will agree that it's<br>that it's yet that they don't want it<br>some will want it that's<br>absolutely fine but the disability voice<br>for maori voice has not even been<br>heard on this and so we're about to vote<br>on a law<br>that will effectively do what what's<br>happening now to maori disabled so let<br>me give you a quick example and this is<br>why i'm doing the work i'm doing<br>in 1996 ro williams was killed by the<br>state because he was mildly disabled an<br>older maori man<br>needed dialysis they said no so what<br>happens is it went to court the whanau<br>said we'll pay for his dialysis<br>we just want a bit more time with uncle<br>because we just want to be able to<br>gather the whanau to say goodbye<br>the state time and time again refused<br>and he was essentially euthanized<br>involuntarily<br>by denying him dialysis that's 1990s<br>i was on undergrad in law school then<br>and it really<br>that's what opened my door up to human<br>rights then in 2010 when i was the<br>solicitor for manganese law center i was<br>contacted about<br>robert namu similar scenario brain<br>injury<br>needed dialysis maori man northland same<br>one<br>roe was from northland as well uh<br>and the state said no that was under<br>jonathan coleman no<br>we have to ration our health care and he<br>doesn't qualify<br>i don't know whether he didn't qualify<br>because he was maori or whether he<br>didn't qualify because he was brain<br>injured<br>or he wasn't certainly wasn't of an age<br>to disqualify<br>again another man who died drowning in<br>his fluids<br>as he was denied dialysis we now have<br>in whangarei hospital right this minute<br>that the media don't know about and i've<br>got to be careful here<br>however this is a phenomena<br>and i won't gender eyes or anything but<br>this phenomena<br>had a massive brain aneurysm and<br>survived went to whangarei we came to<br>auckland hospital with flowan<br>they're on a ventilator and they've lost<br>all<br>movement except for a couple of fingers<br>but their mind's fine<br>they got transferred back to whangarei<br>because um auckland<br>said uh we can't afford them here<br>anymore we can't do any more<br>sent them back today the doctor said we<br>want to put a dnr do not resuscitate on<br>her<br>on them oops um and i said no<br>well they said um no and she said<br>herself<br>she wants to live there's always an<br>assumption that<br>disabled people want to die they noted<br>they wanted to live<br>now the doctors have said no we can't<br>afford you<br>we want to send you home so you can die<br>at home so essentially i've<br>told the whanau you need to get a lawyer<br>and you need to get in there and stop it<br>because it's happened to<br>three of my whanau members over the last<br>five years where they're<br>in northland they refuse to treat them<br>and they die so this person at the<br>moment wants to live but because they're<br>so severely disabled the state wants to<br>kill them<br>so we don't need legalized euthanasia<br>frankly disabled get euthanized anyway<br>so we need to be aware of certain issues<br>and some of them are quite serious<br>we have a lack of housing access now<br>when i was on kaela briefly<br>i was described as an irritant to the<br>board because i got the first disability<br>access plan in place for the first time<br>in 70 years<br>so then they got rid of me after that um<br>and but i got it in place so i'm happy<br>because that means they're now obligated<br>they want only 15 of housing new zealand<br>houses to be accessible we need it to be<br>a hundred percent because they're a<br>state provider<br>we have uh less than three percent of<br>our people in access housing which means<br>97<br>don't have appropriate housing or are<br>being hidden by living at home with<br>money and daddy<br>when young adults should be out in their<br>own environment um<br>all those seniors getting put into<br>residential care because we have no<br>housing for them<br>so that's something that you can get<br>involved in there's<br>you know the housing movement the<br>election<br>you need to say whether or not you<br>believe in something our young people<br>we've got to provide them with the<br>information<br>so you need to be educating those at<br>university about how to vote<br>what do the referendums mean provided in<br>all formats<br>for them support them to make their<br>decisions and get people to the polling<br>booth<br>because honestly i've been fighting for<br>a long time i'm now seen as one of the<br>senior leaders<br>it's this next generation you guys that<br>are going to be the<br>important part of change i'm going to<br>die before i see a ministry<br>i'll be dead before i see a disabilities<br>act but i'm not going to stop pushing<br>for it<br>you guys are the ones who are going to<br>hold it through to the next level and<br>that's why i'm here<br>because i really want to encourage you<br>to keep your voices there<br>the human rights act is not well known<br>health and disability commissioners act<br>is not well known<br>and yet we are being abused every single<br>day under that act<br>so learn about it understand it and<br>start advocating in your communities<br>for change by telling them about it<br>teach people their rights they won't<br>shut up<br>awesome thank you yeah i think it's um<br>so true that or everything you said is<br>true and amazing um<br>i think that yeah we all have a bit of<br>responsibility i think especially<br>as students to um be educated ourselves<br>and then educate<br>others and those around us and that's<br>family members though<br>um we all know that politics chat with<br>family members<br>can often be complicated but yeah i<br>think<br>it's so important to have these<br>conversations with everyone and yeah<br>just to emphasize that you know the<br>housing crisis<br>is a human rights issue um and<br>you know it completely goes against the<br>united nations convention<br>on disability rights because we have a<br>right to housing and we have a right for<br>not to be living in poverty but<br>unfortunately so much<br>the disabled community is um so<br>yeah i think as i said i think a lot of<br>students<br>sort of on a smaller scale within<br>university itself<br>do not know what is actually on offer<br>for them<br>at university so they might not know<br>what services are available<br>um thinking disability services or what<br>rights they have<br>and i was wondering jala i think you've<br>done a lot of work here and also huhana<br>you've done a lot work in the tertiary<br>sector<br>i was wondering whether you might have<br>some advice regarding navigating the<br>power imbalances that<br>exist within these long-standing<br>institutions like universities and how<br>can<br>students ensure they're getting the<br>services that they have a right to<br>which i think is particularly pertinent<br>at the moment when<br>um you know years disabled students were<br>saying we want lecture recordings<br>then it only just happened because of a<br>global pandemic so<br>um yeah i was wondering if you could<br>speak to your experience on<br>affecting change within an institution<br>as a student<br>sure thing i thank you for your question<br>i think the power imbalances is a really<br>important thing to talk about because<br>there's this kind of individual<br>individualization responsibility of like<br>oh you know you just go and do your<br>thing like you just don't ask them for<br>it<br>and it's it's so naive to expect young<br>people particularly undergraduate<br>students to just<br>be perfectly comfortable to walk up to<br>management or asia or whoever it is and<br>demand something that they don't may not<br>fully understand what their rights are<br>and i think that's<br>really naive and really harmful to put<br>that on people so<br>like simply recognizing that there is<br>inherent power dynamics within an<br>institution<br>that is as elitist and as colonial and<br>as ridiculous<br>as a university is a huge step<br>forward for these conversations because<br>it's not something that's talked about a<br>lot<br>and for young people to simply recognize<br>that<br>you know i have this thing that i want<br>dealt with and<br>actually this is not an equal playing<br>field and i am going to need extra<br>support and that's totally valid and<br>okay and it shouldn't be like this but<br>this is the way it is<br>and basically understanding that equity<br>of like yes we need extra support to<br>level that playing field<br>and i think part of that is something<br>that dsa and other organizations like<br>dsa are doing is providing a community<br>where i mean we know power and numbers<br>strength and numbers that kind of thing<br>like<br>students can feel so so isolated and<br>like they're the only one in the world<br>of experience in this thing they're<br>experiencing and i<br>i work as a tutor and i get 10 students<br>with the same issue coming to me saying<br>nobody understands me<br>and you just want to push them all in a<br>room together and be like<br>look after each other um so empowering<br>students to be like<br>hear your communities hear the people<br>who will stand with you and stand by you<br>and your advocates who<br>all have this huge variety of lived<br>experience and knowledge and are experts<br>in their own experiences<br>who can assist you in this process and<br>being able to form that community and to<br>confront<br>whoever is needed to be confronted at a<br>university<br>is a huge thing for students and it<br>enables so much change when people feel<br>like they're not alone<br>because i know in a lot of communities<br>of you know<br>oppression disabled communities for<br>example they can feel so isolated<br>and that is partially physical isolation<br>due to accessibility<br>accessibility issues and partially just<br>due to this complete lack of awareness<br>around certain things<br>so creating these communities of<br>awareness and communities of support<br>um and just to be able to talk with each<br>other i think<br>is a huge step forward and challenging<br>those power imbalances<br>and also having these conversations of<br>like a university is not<br>a neutral unbiased equal institution<br>it is absurd and it is built to<br>privilege a particular type of person<br>who is realistically like nine percent<br>of the population<br>um and that is something that really<br>drives me crazy so<br>that is my very compliment answer to<br>your question i am sure<br>i'll try and be quick i want the other<br>voices there<br>um you're gonna have to be prepared to<br>fight know that you are gonna face<br>barriers okay<br>know that it's not gonna be easy but the<br>whole point of succeeding<br>is being prepared to stand up so half of<br>it's bluff<br>all right i went in uh at aut one time<br>when i was a lawyer for adl<br>and i had a client here's dysphagia<br>dyspraxia um but wanted to do the<br>culinary course and they said no no no<br>no you can't do it you know you've got<br>to do this independently you're not<br>allowed to do it without<br>and um anyway we got them to agree that<br>a support person and see how it went<br>came out with 90 above and<br>won awards that year the second year<br>went back<br>met with the lawyer they were declined<br>again<br>went back there we agreed to another<br>plan they got another year came out in<br>their 90s<br>third year final year no the lawyer took<br>one look at them and said well you<br>better sort it out or if you've got a<br>human rights case so<br>often you know the very thing you're<br>afraid of doing<br>which is confronting someone is<br>do it and one of those things is do not<br>like one of the things i teach my young<br>guys especially my young nephews who are<br>maori lippy little<br>buggers um i say to them the minute that<br>a<br>cop is going to stop you because they<br>will because you're brown do not swear<br>at them do not give them lips<br>say your name give them your address and<br>say to them am i<br>under arrest if they say well uh like<br>you know<br>yes then what am i under arrest for<br>please they tell you<br>and tell them thank you take me to the<br>station i would like a lawyer please<br>and that's it and i actually did that<br>when we had the what was it the<br>99 the one percent the it was when<br>people were<br>locking down over in uh auckland and rt<br>square<br>and camping um and i remember it because<br>the police came without<br>towels tags i wasn't involved i was<br>actually going to meetings and one day<br>the police band came and they were<br>arresting everybody<br>so i yelled out the bill of rights act<br>to them all a lot of them remembered<br>that<br>and afterwards they exercised that and<br>they didn't get charged<br>no you're right but if you don't know<br>your rights then<br>go and get some support be prepared<br>to get knocked back you know i got<br>knocked back time and time again through<br>my academic years and then when i was<br>briefly at aut as a lecturer<br>i had no support i got knocked back and<br>the students were getting support but<br>the staff didn't so don't be prepared<br>that things are going to come to you on<br>a platter<br>they won't so be prepared that you will<br>have to fight<br>but to do that you need the tools so get<br>the support you need<br>learn what you need to learn know the<br>legislation<br>understand what your rights are and<br>you're going to be fine<br>but you need to realize there's nothing<br>to be scared of<br>in exercising your rights that fear is<br>then because they're afraid that you<br>will take it further<br>not that they're afraid that you won't<br>they're afraid that you will<br>so the more that you push the more<br>they'll become afraid<br>change doesn't come without education<br>you can't clean the washing<br>without agitating the soap powder and<br>everything in there<br>so just remember keep yourself<br>safe by knowing your rights and getting<br>the support you need<br>to go forward and exercising them yeah i<br>just add on to that as well i think it's<br>also about like<br>finding your advocate finding your<br>person because you know not everyone has<br>the same ability to access the same<br>services<br>as terrible as that is and there are<br>people<br>like everyone for example in this call<br>people who will stand up and who will<br>do that what is necessary because<br>obviously i think this is something that<br>we might<br>talk about later resistance looks<br>different in so many different ways um<br>and not everyone is comfortable<br>yelling in the streets and that is<br>totally valid and just finding that<br>person who will be that person<br>while you do what is right for you in<br>that space and there are advocates of<br>all different types of people<br>whether that's a student leader or a<br>university employee or your tutor or<br>whoever one of us whoever it is<br>that person will stand up and be like no<br>i will back you i will do whatever you<br>need<br>and connecting with those people can<br>just it can be life changing<br>because for a lot of people who have<br>experienced marginalization<br>they haven't had that person they<br>haven't felt that<br>and that can be that can change<br>someone's entire life entire world view<br>so if you're somebody who's like i<br>really want to help but i don't know<br>what to do<br>make yourself a champion of these issues<br>put yourself forward proactively be like<br>i'm here i will stand for you don't like<br>push yourself on people because that's<br>unnecessary<br>but just stand there like this is me<br>this is how i am this is what i do and<br>awesome that was great um i think just<br>for those if there are any people who<br>are out there<br>thinking i would love to get some of<br>these services that might help me i'd<br>really recommend community law<br>um and services like know your rights if<br>you have any issues and also abuser has<br>an advocacy person who you can get in<br>touch with<br>and they will help you with any issues<br>with course coordinators or stuff<br>um so i thought i'd just put that out<br>there cool so i think<br>um joelle you kind of touched on this<br>but party um<br>and you also touched on this party in<br>your first in your intro<br>but a lot of young people you know want<br>to affect change but as we've kind of<br>established<br>not quite sure how to go about it and i<br>think there is a misconception that<br>advocacy is about you know<br>being the angry person the grassroots<br>activism<br>you know protests writing all this stuff<br>that i'm you know where<br>we all do um but you have also affected<br>heaps of change through your music and<br>been awarded for it um<br>for your contribution to pacifica music<br>and um<br>yeah i was wondering whether you could<br>speak to that and potentially give us<br>some advice on how we can<br>draw on our strengths and passions to<br>really like create<br>change in a in a creative way and create<br>oh sorry i think you're mute<br>sorry yeah look um one of the things i<br>want to say<br>is that um as a pacific islander um<br>you know we we have a different way of<br>um<br>approaching what i guess you might<br>describe as our own way of<br>protest historically um<br>you know we we had a um a movement back<br>in the 1920s called the mold movement<br>and that was basically a protest<br>movement that was led by our people to<br>wrestle away from the administration of<br>the new zealand government<br>and what we did was we what our people<br>did was they did a<br>it was always about a peaceful protest<br>because that was the way of our people<br>was<br>um in peace in humility<br>and dignity that would always be our<br>approach so they had this match and with<br>our spiritual leader<br>some assessor who was leading it and he<br>actually got shot<br>by the soldiers and as he lay dying he<br>stressed the value of peaceful protest<br>for<br>for our people despite the fact that<br>there was a violent confrontation and<br>i know that we'd be brought up um within<br>our own psyches to believe<br>to trust people in power to trust the<br>experts<br>to always believe that they have the<br>answers for us<br>and in a lot of ways that kind of um led<br>us to be<br>uh not so much um how can i put it<br>just to be silent and to be um<br>exploited anyway but there are different<br>ways of doing that and so<br>for me um<br>my grandfather wrote a musical piece out<br>of what happened<br>in that incident and it's quite an<br>iconic song<br>and it's called bessie on the ball which<br>is a song of the mull<br>and why i wanted to try and highlight<br>that is because<br>historically we've had things that have<br>happened to us around colonization<br>around religion playing a huge part in<br>coercing our people into submission um<br>and not questioning the powers that be<br>and so as we um with each generation<br>that's always um passed on as such to<br>you know to never question and i know<br>now at this stage um when i see some of<br>our families who are dealing with people<br>who have<br>family members who are disabled they're<br>frustrated with the system because<br>they don't want to question it or they<br>feel like they're powerless so they just<br>get on with it and do it themselves<br>so for me um<br>why i chose music for our young people<br>is because<br>it has the ability to change perceptions<br>and i hope i'm answering the question<br>but what i'm um what i do know is that<br>music has played a big part as a form of<br>narrative<br>is a form of storytelling and therefore<br>it's validity in terms of actually being<br>part of a<br>movement that suggests activism<br>protests social justice<br>is um as inherent in us<br>is is well i'll speak as a samoan<br>so um i try and pass it on in terms of<br>young people in terms of the ads because<br>some of the uh they're so connected to<br>music<br>for example contemporary music and there<br>are a lot of our artists who are now<br>coming out<br>as specific artists yet i don't see<br>disabled pacific artists so for me<br>is okay what happens when we get our<br>people there they start to<br>for example i have a music video called<br>shiva<br>and it's all about dancing i had a whole<br>lot of disabled people there that were<br>all dancing having a good time<br>but in other people's perceptions we<br>don't actually<br>they don't believe that we could move<br>that we could dance that we have<br>um artistic creativity within us<br>and for me that challenges the system<br>and that's another for me so<br>i always think that it's it's not so<br>much a um<br>out there in your facebook protest but<br>it's a way of complementing<br>others and building the confidence in<br>our own people<br>to be able to take part in other forms<br>of<br>awesome thank you yeah i think music is<br>such a powerful<br>tool and i know i don't know i think<br>music kind of gets to<br>the core of what it means to be human in<br>a way what it means to live in a<br>community and that's what we're all<br>kind of fighting for as well that<br>everyone within communities are<br>recognized<br>um yeah awesome so i think um<br>laura i guess it's the same with you<br>that with action station<br>you've also shown the power of sort of<br>creative forms of change and people<br>power change<br>and how small actions carried out by<br>large groups of people can be hugely<br>successful<br>and i think that um a lot of the issues<br>we see in the world today feel huge and<br>i'm thinking like climate<br>issues and poverty and there's always of<br>that hesitation there i'm too small to<br>i'm too i'm one person too small to<br>effect change so i was wondering whether<br>you could tell us a bit more about<br>action station<br>and maybe give some advice as to how we<br>can take practical steps that don't seem<br>too daunting to make a difference in the<br>face of some of these overwhelming<br>issues<br>sure i'll do my best um so<br>um it is true that it can be very<br>difficult to create<br>change within systems as an individual<br>and so i think jala's point earlier<br>about<br>working with others building a community<br>of support around you particularly a<br>diverse community um in terms of<br>experience thought and contribution<br>um because um uh because<br>um you don't want to like no one like<br>we're not going to create a fair<br>flourishing beautiful<br>like future for disabled pacifica maori<br>migrant gay muslim people with like an<br>all-white social movement<br>of like cis you know hetero able-bodied<br>folk and so<br>our movements need to be as diverse as<br>the world as the world we're trying to<br>try to build<br>um so that's one thing is that work with<br>other people<br>um the other thing is that i think it's<br>really important to um<br>uh i always say to my team that good<br>campaigns are like<br>80 research and 20 tactics<br>and it doesn't mean that you need to go<br>away and do like a phd on whatever issue<br>it is that you're trying to solve it but<br>it does mean you need to think about a<br>few key<br>things um you need to think about what<br>is your vision<br>like what is your goal what is it that<br>you are trying to achieve<br>if you achieve everything that you<br>manage to achieve how will the world be<br>different<br>um and i think i think starting with<br>vision is important because<br>i think the more we can articulate our<br>vision the more likely it is we'll be<br>able to<br>bring it into being and what i mean by<br>that is i find myself in rooms with<br>activists quite a lot of the time<br>um and um we'll do this little we'll<br>stand up in a circle and people will go<br>around the room and people will be like<br>oh hi i'm so-and-so i'm passionate about<br>climate change<br>i'm so in some passionate about child<br>poverty um but of course they're not<br>passionate about climate change and<br>child poverty what they're passionate<br>about is<br>the um is nurturing the earth and its<br>ability to uh<br>to nurture life and all its diversity um<br>they're passionate about every single<br>child having the ability to unlock less<br>opportunities and to um<br>to have fun and be a kid and i and so i<br>think starting with vision is really<br>important<br>and then um and then breaking it down<br>into a goal<br>that you can actually achieve and so no<br>one is going to believe you when you say<br>sign this petition to stop climate<br>change like that's not a thing we all<br>know that a petition is not going to<br>stop climate change<br>however if your petition is oh hi we're<br>generation zero and we want to build a<br>protected cycle lane<br>through k road because we want to make<br>it easier for people to cycle<br>as a solution to climate change and as a<br>way to enable people to travel more<br>easily in the city<br>in ways that um aren't so carbon<br>intensive<br>um then that's a believable tactic for<br>the goal that you are trying to achieve<br>and so breaking down your lofty<br>aspirations into more achievable goals<br>is is another important step in doing<br>that 80 of the research and work that<br>you do before you go into tactics<br>um it's also important to think about<br>who are the people that have the power<br>to<br>change what it is that you are trying to<br>change um<br>and uh because that's the person that<br>you're going to be targeting your energy<br>and your time towards<br>and so to give you an example we had a<br>young person um lucy<br>who um she struggled with mental ill<br>health and anxiety and depression<br>throughout her high school years<br>um and she would she would found and she<br>was like from quite a privileged school<br>she was like a decile nine school<br>um and um and she was going to see like<br>a private counselor but she was lying to<br>her friends about<br>where she was going when she was going<br>to counseling and then one day she just<br>decided to be honest with her friends<br>because she couldn't live this sort of<br>double life anymore<br>and then lo and behold her friends were<br>like oh my gosh i'm also going to<br>therapy oh my gosh i'm also going to<br>counseling<br>and what they realized from those<br>conversations is that they didn't have<br>anything happening in their school in<br>which they were being facilitated to<br>talk about their mental health and to<br>share their experiences and to share<br>tools and<br>and knowledge um from their own<br>experience and so what she decided to do<br>after she left high school<br>was she started a petition um calling<br>for better mental health education in<br>all schools<br>and then she worked with a group of her<br>high school friends and then they<br>um went back to their high schools and<br>worked with the various activist groups<br>to<br>basically go around and collect<br>signatures by hand um<br>we worked with her to place a bunch of<br>stories in the media to make some social<br>media videos<br>where she was just talking about why she<br>was passionate about this issue<br>um and then we managed to get that<br>petition up to about 10 000 signatures<br>she went and delivered that to um her<br>local mp who was david seymour um and at<br>this time he was the associate minister<br>of education i believe<br>um and and so he was also a relevant<br>person to deliver it to because he<br>obviously has the heir of the education<br>minister<br>um and then what happened after that is<br>um as she got the opportunity to present<br>her case to<br>select committee about what better<br>mental health education in schools could<br>look like<br>and at that point she rallied a bunch of<br>different young people to talk about<br>what their dreams and hopes are for<br>um for this kaupapa and that is now<br>going on to<br>inform the um the curriculum that has<br>been developed around how mental<br>health education we taught in schools<br>and so that started from a conversation<br>with a friend<br>to reaching out to an organization like<br>action station<br>to to on a target that has the power to<br>change what it is that you're trying to<br>change<br>um and then working away over time um<br>to to actually turn that from an idea<br>into<br>a reality um and she did that all before<br>the age of like 21 and so<br>and so like people can do incredible<br>things um<br>uh when we work together when we have a<br>plan<br>um and um and when we uh<br>like johannes is willing to accept that<br>there will be setbacks there will be<br>challenges but you just need to keep<br>awesome thank you i think that was some<br>really uh<br>good advice for i'll definitely be<br>keeping all that in mind<br>next time we come up against some things<br>as a club<br>um yeah so i guess another question for<br>uh well for anyone actually<br>um obviously so there are some young<br>people who are really like<br>inherently into politics for some reason<br>or another and a lot of the time<br>um like they're kind of in a bubble so<br>you might i know i'm in a bit of a<br>political bubble<br>with me and my peers um so i was but<br>obviously that's not the case with all<br>young people and<br>i was wondering if anyone might have<br>some insight or<br>i'm thinking about what are the main<br>barriers stopping youth<br>from getting into political issues and<br>other sort of social issues that come<br>from that<br>and how can we all work to combat it<br>both youth and<br>politics and yeah what's the<br>what are some ways that we can try and<br>get people engaged in politics<br>especially<br>as we come up to two extremely important<br>referendums and<br>the election i don't know if anyone<br>wants to<br>put their hand up to go first or<br>oh yeah i can i can say some stuff on<br>that just because i have done a lot of<br>research about young people and<br>their political voice um so<br>um the first thing i will say is that um<br>when we talk about young people not<br>voting it's really important to also<br>acknowledge that the young people who<br>are least likely to vote of the young<br>people<br>are usually young people with<br>disabilities young people who live in<br>rural areas young people who are also<br>maori and pacifica or migrants of color<br>and so they're people who have been let<br>down by our society our economy our<br>democracy<br>and so of course why would they<br>necessarily feel inspired that if they<br>somehow<br>engage in this democracy economy society<br>that has let them down so much that they<br>will be able to fix that and so um<br>and so that's just one of the realities<br>that we're dealing with is that young<br>marginalized people um are ignored and<br>then we somehow<br>ex like young people are somehow<br>expected to get over all of that and fix<br>it<br>at the same time if young people do not<br>get over all of that and fix it it will<br>not get fixed<br>and so like there's sort of this very<br>complex message there which is like yeah<br>it's not your fault that the economy has<br>let you down and that<br>politicians don't represent your<br>interests but unless you do anything<br>about it it's always going to be that<br>way<br>and i think there's something potent in<br>having that conversation with people in<br>a very real way<br>you don't start with that because that's<br>a bit intense like no one wants to hang<br>out at the<br>at the pub with like you are the only<br>one that can fix the things<br>but um but you start with i think vision<br>and dream and aspiration<br>and so often when you talk to people who<br>aren't necessarily<br>um what you would consider um to be uh<br>politically engaged<br>they will often and i've seen this in my<br>own whanau of people who do not vote um<br>but but they do have fully articulated<br>um<br>visions of how the country and their<br>community would be different if things<br>were different<br>and so i often like to talk to my whanau<br>and friends who don't vote about<br>what other things that you would like to<br>change in our society<br>and then they tell me this wonderful<br>vision of how things would be different<br>and i'll be like oh cool cool<br>why do you think it's not like that yet<br>and then they will usually articulate<br>something which is like oh because<br>governments don't listen to us because<br>the white man rules everything blah blah<br>blah<br>and i'll be like oh yeah true how do you<br>reckon we could change that<br>usually only and then they'll come to<br>some they'll arrive at their own<br>conclusion most of the time which is<br>like oh i guess like only if like social<br>movements happen or communities come<br>together or like<br>we rally behind like someone who's gonna<br>do something different and i'll say<br>awesome<br>should we do that and so it's about<br>having a sort of structured conversation<br>that starts with vision<br>um leads into barriers to of that vision<br>like why isn't that happening and then<br>ends with a call to action which is um<br>how can we change that um how can we<br>how can we collectively move past this<br>barrier to uh to paddle the locker<br>towards this vision that we both have<br>um and i find that to be quite an<br>effective method<br>if i could go next if that's okay uh<br>sorry i've got to go sing to my<br>next appointment but um just following<br>on from what laura was saying<br>i think i totally agree and um in terms<br>of for some of our um<br>our disabled pacifica you for me it's<br>about<br>the fact that uh you want to try and<br>bring them together to have this talanoi<br>that's corridor<br>about what politics means for us in our<br>own cultural context<br>and i think that um in terms of<br>because you you want to provide them<br>with a safe environment that they feel<br>quite comfortable in to be able to have<br>that conversation<br>and also you know to build that trust<br>you then can um because<br>what i'm aware is that the reason why we<br>want change is because we<br>as disabled will want to lead our own<br>change<br>we don't want to be led all the time and<br>so which is what's happening now<br>so how can we actually change that role<br>of leadership in ownership so that they<br>can participate<br>in the political environments as well<br>and so for me<br>you know music does that but when you<br>bring them together for something like<br>music or arts<br>it's how you bring out the conversation<br>of the importance of<br>being politically involved and being<br>able to use<br>the art as a platform to<br>have their pathway because one of the<br>things i see right now for our people<br>our young people is there's no pathway<br>or a plan of succession for them to take<br>over from<br>other leaders who have have managed to<br>be in a position of leadership for quite<br>a few years and<br>it may be quite comfortable in that<br>setting and but<br>when is the time for them to move on and<br>let the young people come through and<br>start taking over their ownership for<br>themselves<br>so for me in a cultural context if we<br>have a<br>gathering that we could bring people in<br>and say<br>for example as pacifica and say look you<br>know um<br>this is what the cultural context can<br>mean for us in our own<br>um islands because even though we're<br>pacifica the<br>the whole importance of<br>intersectionality is also crucial<br>and also diversity because we're not<br>just pacifica and that's what happens<br>with labeling<br>and you get thrown into this um group uh<br>approach but under pacifica we are<br>samoan we are tongan we are new where<br>you know we've got<br>um eight or nine different nations under<br>there and so<br>try it for me being able to have that<br>cultural context as your platform<br>for stepping into a political arena is<br>is really crucial and thank you<br>if i do disappear i do apologize i have<br>to kind of take off to my next<br>appointment but i'll try and stay on as<br>long as possible<br>thank you thank you for that and just<br>before you disappear<br>um i'll just say yeah thank you so much<br>for joining um<br>today party we really appreciate your<br>insight and all the buggy you do<br>in this area i know um it does not go<br>unnoticed<br>and yeah thank you so much for joining<br>and for all your amazing insight<br>appreciate being here thank you very<br>much everyone who really enjoyed it<br>great uh huh i think did you want to<br>speak to this point i guess um<br>and papi you know that you nailed it<br>sometimes<br>we we're forgetting in the disability<br>community we've gone and<br>diverted in 2000 we had a really good<br>collective approach to<br>advocating and a lot of us that are now<br>in the older range of leaders we were<br>all part<br>of the state of the nation report that<br>was done by the human rights commission<br>under roswell newland then<br>and boy our voice was strong it was<br>powerful<br>and we got this amazing report out but<br>we've actually<br>got nothing since and part of that issue<br>is um we are gone we've gone very<br>impairment-based so<br>you know if you're not autistic then<br>we've got that group and they'll get fad<br>funding from the ministry of health for<br>that moment<br>which is you know they're their latest<br>favorite little group to to do<br>research on and then you get the other<br>little group other blindies they've got<br>a different network and<br>the problem you've got is by breaking us<br>up<br>we have lost that human rights<br>collective approach now<br>when you think about it a lot of the<br>conservatives they abuse liberals by<br>calling them snowflakes<br>well i smile at that and i go thank you<br>so much<br>they look at me and i go well a<br>snowflake on its own does<br>melt and dissipate quite quickly but can<br>you imagine a whole bunch of snowflakes<br>together<br>that's an avalanche and we can never<br>ever ever move individually far i've<br>done this alone for over 20 years<br>30 years 40 years and it's only just<br>recently that people have started to<br>hear what i've been saying and are<br>coming on board<br>and you know what it's finally being<br>heard that we're pushing for a<br>disabilities act<br>in a ministry on disabilities it's taken<br>that long<br>you cannot move far on your own but if<br>you're also going to just<br>say ah the blindis get everything the<br>deafies don't<br>you know then what you're doing is<br>you're starting to hierarchy<br>our disability networks and we're saying<br>oh we're physically disabled you don't<br>you don't need accommodations but they<br>forget that we are also very<br>intersectional<br>i'm a brain injury survivor i've got<br>glaucoma i'm hearing impaired i don't<br>wear my hearing aids<br>as well as physically disabled so i<br>cross many of those networks from abd<br>as well as they think i'm a bit autistic<br>as well which i could be i don't know<br>never been diagnosed<br>why is it so important we focus on our<br>diagnosis<br>rather than focus together on human<br>rights issues<br>i think that's where we've gone and<br>distracted ourselves<br>we all don't have to be rabid activists<br>with a big fist in the air saying<br>you know disabled lives i'm not going to<br>say matter because that's black lives<br>matter slogan i'm not feeling off them<br>but you know disabled lives can't you<br>know not everyone's that<br>some people are background people some<br>people write letters i do poetry as a<br>way of explaining it but also<br>we're not homogeneous either i'm maori<br>with ms<br>you know the ms neurologists<br>discriminate against me because they<br>don't believe that maori getting this<br>but despite me finding research that<br>says we do<br>but at 2.5 times less than others but<br>i'm maori<br>and i can't escape from that identity<br>and no one should<br>minimize or put down their own identity<br>you are who you are and you should<br>celebrate all of that now<br>you know i don't i don't identify in any<br>way as parker because i'm not i'm ha<br>i'm very palestine because my dad's sami<br>which means he's the indigenous people<br>of the scandinavian region<br>so that's why and and i'm proud of it<br>all you know<br>say our identity is a part of who we are<br>if i'm proud<br>of who i am whether it be cultural<br>whether it be my impairment whether it<br>be my gender my sexuality<br>celebrate it but for goodness sake don't<br>go attacking each other anymore in our<br>community we attack too much<br>one lot the acc lock they get everything<br>you know party you're a rich fella<br>um and us poor moh guys we get 12 000<br>for a van if we're lucky you get the 130<br>thousand dollar bands<br>but you know we can't keep attacking on<br>each other because paddy and i are still<br>in in our words we're brother and sister<br>in this journey together<br>and we've got to stop using the<br>privilege that some have<br>with being abc or being blind on a<br>benefit and still getting the benefit<br>and working<br>we've got to work together and say well<br>okay this is unfair<br>how do we make it fair and the only way<br>to do that is to work together<br>and the other thing is i mentor<br>informally a lot of younger people<br>and the reason i'm doing that is i know<br>my voice needs to start to go<br>in the background because i need to be<br>there to support you guys as i get older<br>my disability gets harder<br>to manage and what i've got left is my<br>years of experience my skills<br>so for me it is about me mentoring your<br>voice<br>to take you forward however you want to<br>do that because you guys<br>are the actual future you're going to<br>shape it so when i have a student that<br>says<br>can you supervise a paper and i still do<br>some supervision<br>and it's on this and this well i love it<br>because that what they're doing is<br>they're taking<br>say my idea or some of us other older<br>ones ideas and they're taking it in a<br>new direction<br>don't be afraid to challenge our foldies<br>don't be afraid to challenge our writing<br>our academic work<br>don't be afraid to say hey<br>i've had enough and this is what we're<br>facing<br>i mean one of the things i've had to<br>accept is that i've got certain amounts<br>of plastic on my body<br>that goes into the landfill and that's<br>my catheter and other stuff<br>and you know some of us have pads and<br>stuff and it all goes into landfill<br>why i can't change much of that<br>personally but i can advocate<br>that we get more environmentally<br>friendly products that meet our medical<br>needs as well<br>you know we have old-fashioned vans that<br>aren't electric vans that we need to<br>keep using while they keep legislating<br>away<br>and pricing us out of the market what<br>you've got to do<br>is start advocating that they modify<br>have um<br>vans that they can be modified so that<br>the future generation<br>can have vehicles they can afford to be<br>independent so<br>what what all i can do now in my time of<br>life is to begin the role of mentoring<br>and that's what i'm here for and that's<br>i'm just gonna if alice if we've got<br>some time i might quickly add on to the<br>politics thing cool um so i find that<br>the question of young people in politics<br>is really really interesting so<br>you know i'm young ish uh<br>queer brown refugee migrant background<br>and when i was<br>a young person younger person i didn't<br>see anyone that looked like me in<br>politics i grew up fairly rural<br>to me politics was white men in suits in<br>cities<br>and that was something that i didn't<br>connect with on any level and i had some<br>kind of vague knowledge that oh yes it<br>affects me<br>and i experience all these things but<br>there was just no<br>wasn't even fathomable this idea that me<br>and all of this<br>had a potential to actually make change<br>so i think that you know politicians<br>have a responsibility<br>to people of diverse backgrounds<br>particularly to young people of diverse<br>backgrounds to make<br>their politics accessible and part of<br>that is people who have the privilege to<br>be in those spaces is to challenge<br>politicians and be like<br>what are you saying to these communities<br>what are you doing for these communities<br>what are you doing that is proactive<br>what do you say to them and<br>not everyone obviously has the ability<br>to be in those spaces and that's why<br>those that do<br>i think have the responsibility to do<br>that so that<br>you know i mean my little sisters now<br>have this massive crush on gauri's<br>guaran because she looks<br>like they do and i think that's<br>absolutely wonderful<br>um and life-changing so<br>it's also you know being able to empower<br>um<br>those who want to enter politics and<br>actually be like actually politics is<br>for everyone<br>anyone can run for politics if they have<br>the right support and the right<br>knowledge and i think that's a really<br>important thing to remember because<br>for some of us that idea is just great<br>like what you don't do that you just run<br>for<br>run for politics but you can and people<br>do and people should do that<br>so yeah that's my two cents worth<br>awesome thanks yeah no um that's so true<br>and i think we've seen that<br>also not just with national politics but<br>with local bodies with tamitha paul<br>obviously after being used president is<br>now<br>in wellington city council um cool so i<br>think<br>i'll probably say that if you've got any<br>questions<br>those in this zoom chat um now would be<br>a good time<br>to pop them in the chat function<br>if you can or yeah that's probably the<br>best way to do it and then we can<br>um do that and then while that's<br>happening<br>um i thought i have a general<br>conversation that i thought could be<br>good to discuss so i think um<br>uh there's this really interesting quote<br>that i like um by bell hooks who<br>i don't know if anyone yeah joe you know<br>i'm sure a lot of people know<br>um she's feminist a black feminist<br>writer um<br>she wrote moving from silence into<br>speech is for the oppressed the<br>colonised the exploited and those who<br>stand and struggle side by side<br>a gesture of defiance that heals that<br>makes new life a new growth possible<br>there's that act of speech of talking<br>back that is no mere gesture of empty<br>words that is the expression of our<br>movement from object to subject<br>the liberated voice so i really like<br>that quote because i think it kind of<br>speaks the idea that for those of us who<br>are part of minority groups our presence<br>in spaces like this and in tertiary<br>spaces and just<br>literally anywhere is in itself an act<br>of resistance which i think<br>can be quite an empowering thing to<br>think about when we fall into that trap<br>that you know i'm not advocating or i'm<br>not<br>being an activist in the way that i<br>should like for instance i don't attend<br>protests because physically i cannot<br>and so i'm like does that make me you<br>know a good democratic citizen or<br>political citizen an ally<br>and so i was wondering if anyone would<br>want to speak to the idea of<br>being a good advocate and the concept of<br>sort of<br>owning as you said humana before sort of<br>owning yourself<br>and how the mere act of pride and your<br>own identity<br>um is in itself um<br>resistance and how talking back as<br>ballhawk said as of itself a form of<br>resistance and<br>yeah i don't know if that made any sense<br>but<br>um yeah i i love this quote and we use<br>this<br>idea a lot when working with victim<br>survivors of harm saying that you know<br>your resistance your existence is a form<br>of resistance and i think you know in a<br>world or a society or community where<br>there's specifically designed to silence<br>certain people and to stop them from<br>thriving from succeeding<br>and to make them as small and as<br>inconsequential as possible<br>simply existing and thriving and<br>succeeding<br>is the biggest act of resistance and<br>there are some spaces where it is not<br>the responsibility of those<br>who are being harmed to be the ones in<br>that space it's not the<br>you know it's not the responsibility of<br>the oppressed to explain to the<br>oppressor their oppression that's<br>ridiculous<br>so um you know as i have a chronic<br>illness and some days you know there's<br>so much<br>pressure of like you know gotta be out<br>and loud and running around doing them a<br>thousand things<br>and some days resistance simply is you<br>know getting out of bed<br>or you know making sure that i eat<br>enough<br>um and i think it's so important to be<br>talking about<br>diverse types of resistance and<br>inclusivity and resistance because<br>there's these pressures of like<br>oh you're a bad activist or you know<br>you're a bad feminist or whatever it is<br>if you're not doing x y z and which is<br>incredibly exclusive<br>and incredibly harmful and falls back<br>into that model<br>of you know mainstreaming oppression of<br>like<br>this is the one way that you should look<br>and the one where you should be<br>and it's drawing on that kind of very<br>patriarchal white idea of like<br>science and data and numbers and action<br>and rather actually know<br>like realistically things like music and<br>emotion and storytelling<br>and whatever it is small rituals are<br>equally some cases if not more as<br>powerful and as important but those<br>things have historically been<br>feminized and therefore of less value so<br>yes go from go nuts resistance is<br>everything<br>and just live your lives and be<br>successful and i think that's one of the<br>there's an old saying and i love bell<br>hooks by the way there's an old saying<br>that<br>personal is political political is<br>personal and that happens through the<br>lives of being disabled<br>especially when you're visibly disabled<br>for a maori woman having this on my face<br>makes me very political it's a statement<br>and for being in a wheelchair it's a<br>statement now for goal waves yeah she<br>has a big<br>big uh jaw card and now she's come out<br>as having ms<br>and i i knew about it a long time before<br>she came out and i don't think i knew i<br>knew<br>but it was for her to say it and um<br>i think that's fantastic but she's not<br>part of our community yet she hasn't<br>been<br>at the front lines of our community she<br>hasn't been at the grassroots level of<br>disability<br>and so she needs to also be supported<br>to understand her own journey because<br>she's a newbie tallest<br>and it's going to be very hard for her<br>so the sad thing for us is suddenly we<br>go yay we've got a voice in parliament<br>fantastic you know but she doesn't know<br>the nuances and i remember when you were<br>disabled like puppy and that when they<br>first started coming forward<br>they had all these ideas and things and<br>when you've been a veteran of<br>40 50 odd years you kind of<br>sit back and look and go yeah you think<br>we haven't been trying<br>you know it's great to see the<br>enthusiasm but what they forget is some<br>of us have tried and tried and tried<br>and then the next generation come and go<br>yes right we're going to do what the<br>other lot didn't do because they failed<br>it's not bad it's the very fact the<br>system does not want to let us succeed<br>it works better at dividing and one of<br>the<br>reasons i know this is as a maori the<br>foreshore and seabed is a big example<br>when maori are divided we don't have a<br>strong collective voice<br>one of the times we do is when we are<br>collectively<br>agreed on something and with the<br>foreshore and seabed we were<br>over 20 000 people attended another<br>event that got<br>changed was when um<br>uh no ryan tamaki destiny church went to<br>parliament<br>you know enough is a mouse kind of thing<br>my son who's a young gay man then<br>he's still young but he's you know a<br>younger gay man he was at uni<br>um he went to the protest and he came<br>back and said to me mum i've never been<br>so frightened of my life<br>um because of the the aggression that<br>they showed towards the<br>lgbtqi community there and that was on<br>legal marriage um one does have to be<br>prepared to not be afraid but my son's<br>never been one that goes to protest<br>he does it on social media he does it<br>through<br>challenging people around their<br>statements who does it in other ways<br>and you know we've got to be sure we<br>don't lose those voices<br>but you do need to know and i think what<br>jala said is absolutely right<br>um and i'm sure laura your process as<br>well during the action station i think<br>getting a matariki a holiday each year<br>is something that you know maori have<br>asked for for years and years and years<br>sometimes we get caught up in the big<br>picture we forget to get into the<br>tiny bits that need to be done to make<br>change happen<br>and the action station process is a tiny<br>bit to make change happen<br>and the other thing with my wanting to<br>do the disabilities act in the ministry<br>well i've been asked to get hold of you<br>laura and i must do<br>because we want to do an action station<br>petition to<br>call for that to happen for disabilities<br>act and i'm just designing a generic<br>letter now to go to all things those are<br>other ways<br>of being active but also just remember<br>um know your history know the disability<br>history and know it well<br>the whole reason why i have an issue<br>with euthanasia phil is simply because<br>action t4 was seen as a compassionate<br>law<br>under hitler when they said and the<br>nurses did it thinking they were being<br>compassionate caring and loving<br>and they murdered over they originally<br>it was said 250 000 disabled they now<br>think it was far higher<br>a lot were never registered they were<br>just killed in the doctor's office<br>at the maternity office at the maternity<br>hospital<br>we've got to remember our history in<br>order to know why<br>the older ones keep harping onto the<br>same issue<br>but also so you can take it further<br>forward<br>in your own style in your own way and<br>always remember that the history you<br>will repeat history<br>if you don't learn from the past but one<br>of the successes of activism<br>is if you're sitting here and someone's<br>talking to you about how they need help<br>listen and hear what they're saying<br>don't put your slant on it<br>listen to them hear them and try and<br>respond to<br>their need not just your own because<br>it's easy to find your own needs<br>but you need to hear what they're saying<br>not what you say what they say<br>ah thank you for that that was great i<br>think yeah um<br>joel i totally hear what you say about<br>um sometimes just doing<br>the bare minimum is resistance in itself<br>i often say that self-care is a form of<br>resistance because in a way it is<br>especially<br>for disabled people you know we're told<br>that<br>you know you have to be up you have to<br>be working every day that's how like<br>capitalist ableist society works and so<br>sometimes the mere act of<br>just staying inside because you know the<br>act of getting me out of the house is<br>just too much physically for you that<br>day or mentally<br>and you know you beat yourself up for it<br>but i think that meh<br>act of doing that and looking after<br>yourself is resistance in itself which i<br>try and practice but yeah i think we can<br>all learn how to look after ourselves a<br>bit better<br>um cool so and this is<br>um so she asks one major concern such<br>confusion<br>i have is why is there such a lack of<br>moldy support within mental health and<br>addiction<br>i only had one maori service available<br>available to me<br>and they failed me and were terribly run<br>as a service compared to the other<br>services<br>where do i start looking into this whole<br>issue<br>yeah go for it gosh sorry<br>laura come in any time it's a hard one<br>you've only really got mainstream<br>services but there are some<br>maori services but they're very hard to<br>find and one of the problems is<br>the ministry of health have only ever<br>funded one percent of all<br>health funding going into holder funding<br>into services so we're 18 of the<br>population but we get one percent of the<br>health funding<br>the health ministry has failed and<br>deemed itself to be incompetent<br>it is not capable of providing<br>appropriate care and services<br>to disabled maori disabled to mental<br>health services maori mental health<br>all of those areas now under lockdown<br>they provide and under their budget<br>this coalition provided millions towards<br>mental health support<br>but we have yet to see it come out we<br>don't have the people in the services<br>because<br>they burn out they get exhausted they<br>get caught up on the mainstream and any<br>co-prophet maori is few and far between<br>i know that i've been part of the koi<br>order plan which is pai lui's plan<br>on they're trying to develop a plan to<br>uh to do their own uh support<br>uh their own to get their funding to run<br>their own services essentially that's<br>mental health<br>health and disability all of it needs<br>assessments a whole lot<br>and so they're designing a plan now if<br>that's the case that's one of the<br>largest ereads will start to affect<br>change<br>i can't say that's there now because<br>it's not there now<br>but the thing is you don't give up i<br>know you're exhausted believe me some<br>days i'm so tired that i'm i'm just<br>crying on my wife's shoulder saying i<br>can't take anymore<br>it's normal to get that tired that's why<br>it's so important you take time out to<br>care for yourself<br>and one of those things when i'm<br>exhausted and i forget<br>my mate will say to me look we're going<br>away for a weekend and we're actually<br>planning something away<br>it doesn't have to be somewhere<br>expensive you know you can just go<br>somewhere where there's a bit of bush<br>a bit of ocean and feel nature again<br>because that for me is my<br>my um cleansing place really or i go to<br>the temple because i'm a buddhist so i<br>go to the buddhist temple<br>and i spend some time have a lovely<br>vegetarian kai always around food<br>i don't know if that's my maori thing or<br>just me um and<br>the temple just gives you that calmness<br>and that pace what is it<br>that gives you that ability to find the<br>peace of mind<br>to replenish yourself to get back into<br>the battle the first thing you need to<br>be doing is start to hook up with the<br>networks and you'll find them they are<br>there<br>um hook up in with them and then start<br>agitating from the inside<br>and it may be like you know for me i go<br>straight to the minister<br>so this is one of the keys of being well<br>connected and it's taken me 30 years to<br>get connected so<br>it doesn't happen overnight but during<br>lockdown for instance i had a disabled<br>mother<br>falling ringing me up crying absolute<br>mess locked down<br>for her adult daughter had been coughed<br>over by a nurse<br>doing cares her adult daughter is immune<br>compromised<br>and then they threatened to kick the<br>mother out because she asked why the<br>woman wasn't marked<br>why she was at work why she didn't have<br>a mask or gloves on to do<br>bloods on her daughter now the<br>charge nurse came in and threatened her<br>told her you've got to leave security is<br>on its way<br>so i said to the mother hold fire this<br>is lockdown remember<br>you're not no one's available to you so<br>i said<br>hold fire tell them you've contacted<br>your lawyer they're not to do anything<br>until the minister gets in touch with<br>them<br>and i rang uh carmel and she reminded me<br>that it was dfs which is jenny selisa<br>so i messaged jenny on facebook i said<br>to her jenny i need to talk to you at<br>surgeon<br>she rolled me back we had an hour and a<br>half conversation<br>i got hold of audrey she got hold of<br>audrey who's the deputy commissioner<br>disabilities commissioner for moh told<br>them the scenario they went back<br>needless to say the mother didn't leave<br>the daughter got the surgery<br>and they were more careful about how<br>they dealt with it so learn to get<br>connected well<br>get very well connected to those you<br>need to<br>get to the political meetings whichever<br>party i've gone bipartisan<br>i've had to work with national<br>over the euthanasia bill with some<br>national people<br>i never thought i'd ever i feel like i'd<br>sold myself out to my soul<br>on that one but in the end i found out<br>that there's people it's a learning<br>curve for me there are good and bad in<br>every single party<br>there are people that you'll like and<br>not like in every single party<br>people you agree and not agree with and<br>every single party but act<br>and the brand new controversy theory<br>parties that have just formed so please<br>don't join them<br>um you know i know they appeal to the<br>young but please don't<br>join them they just sit on the fringe<br>that night<br>um and maybe you do want to okay um but<br>you know this this whole thing of of<br>getting of being exhausted as a natural<br>part of being disabled<br>so the first thing you've got to do is<br>find out<br>slowly move your way in and get to know<br>the people you need to get to know<br>and become known to them do it through<br>either your study<br>where you get heard through publication<br>if you're academically minded<br>do it through joining a political party<br>and then they get to know you as you<br>turn up at meetings<br>do it through our vlogs or blogs<br>and you send them out and do a public<br>page and do it as a thought leader which<br>is what i do every day<br>do what you are comfortable with doing<br>but make sure you connect to the right<br>networks the right people<br>who will then lead you into the path<br>that you want to get to get change<br>don't do it alone do it collectively go<br>with a friend<br>go with somebody but don't you know just<br>remember if you want to approach a<br>politician<br>you employ them we pay their wages<br>they are bound to us they're bosh<br>not them to you so if they start to get<br>lippy like a couple of them try<br>i remind them that i employ them and as<br>their employer i may have to<br>think about a new review on whether they<br>keep their job at the election<br>so you know now is the time to be<br>politically active<br>do it use it be loud be proud<br>and go for it<br>um i'll just add one quick thing if<br>that's all right which is um<br>uh which is related to self-care and<br>related to<br>mental health and related to um strategy<br>which is there's this tool called the um<br>spectrum of allies which<br>folks can look up but it's basically<br>this idea that you can<br>segment people into five groups<br>generally speaking there are the people<br>who really strongly agree with you<br>there are people who a little bit agree<br>with you but they're not really taking<br>any action<br>there are the people who are neutral on<br>the issue that you care about<br>there are the people that a little bit<br>disagree with you but they're not taking<br>a lot of action and then there's the<br>people that vehemently disagree with you<br>we can waste a lot of time and energy<br>arguing with the people who vehemently<br>disagree with us<br>and we are better off using our energy<br>and our time and our resources which<br>are finite on getting more of the<br>passive people to be more active<br>and getting more of the neutral people<br>to be more passive allies and so it's<br>all about moving people just<br>one segment over closer into the um<br>core of the work that we do together um<br>and uh and i think in this age of social<br>media which has sort of<br>exacerbated polarization or really<br>revealed polarization<br>or facebook benefits from our<br>polarization because the more we're<br>arguing in the comment section the more<br>they're able to show us ads and then the<br>more billions that<br>mark zuckerberg makes so i think it's<br>really important in the age of um<br>of forced polarization through 24 news<br>uh 24-hour news cycles and social media<br>that<br>profits from that to actually um tap out<br>where you can<br>i mean i say this as a person who has<br>used the power of the internet<br>to build the platform that i have today<br>to coordinate the movement that i'm a<br>part of today<br>um it is really really important to turn<br>off<br>devices and to not get sucked in<br>to arguing with people you don't agree<br>with on the internet um<br>and so yeah that would be my last um my<br>last thing to share<br>that i hope is useful to folks<br>awesome thank you um great yeah i think<br>everyone falling into the um trap of<br>arguing with people<br>uh on facebook can be tempting but never<br>goes down well um<br>awesome so unless anyone else has any<br>more questions i think it's probably<br>a good time to wrap up so we can let our<br>very busy panelists get back to their<br>lives and their<br>awesome mahi so um party oh he's gone<br>but<br>we'll say anyway thank you um laura jala<br>and johanna thank you so much for<br>joining us today i thought i was being<br>quite um<br>quite ambitious by inviting you all i<br>was like oh you know i'll invite them<br>but we'll see<br>and i was like so shocked and like<br>amazed that everyone was like keen<br>so yeah thank you so much um i'm sure we<br>can all agree that the insight you've<br>given us today is truly inspiring and<br>um even though us disabled vote don't<br>like that word but um<br>yeah i thank you so much for all the<br>work you do to create social positive<br>change because<br>as we all know it's certainly tough work<br>but it doesn't go unnoticed<br>so thank you and thank you for everyone<br>who came we
