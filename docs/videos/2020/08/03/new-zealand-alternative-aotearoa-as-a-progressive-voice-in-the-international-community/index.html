new<br>zealand alternative and<br>work so my background is<br>uh as a campaigner on humanitarian<br>and disarmament issues around the world<br>i spent about 16 years doing that in<br>different countries worked on the<br>landmines campaign<br>cluster bomb campaign various other bits<br>of work<br>and i came back to new zealand about<br>three and a half years ago and<br>have been working on<br>more social and environmental topics and<br>themes and also this this work<br>in relation to the role of altitude or<br>new zealand in the world<br>um yeah and as lin said i'm also an<br>elected<br>councillor for the greater wellington<br>regional council where i chair the<br>climate committee<br>so i've got lots of interests on the go<br>i'll hand over to evelyn evelyn if you<br>would like to introduce yourself<br>hi everyone i'm evelyn masters coming to<br>you from tamaki makoto in auckland<br>i'm a new zealand-born cook islander<br>that's had a very mobile life<br>moving all around the place and doing<br>lots of different things as well<br>predominantly i'm an independent<br>research specialist<br>i do work in the pacific um on different<br>types of social justice and development<br>projects<br>um before that i've had sort of<br>different<br>types of academic roles and for<br>for five years i was actually living in<br>berlin with my family<br>where i was part of a political website<br>and blog<br>so i have a really strong background in<br>research<br>and communication and when i heard about<br>the new zealand alternative coming<br>together it was around about the same<br>time<br>when i'd landed back in new zealand and<br>it felt like a<br>sort of a perfect entry into thinking<br>about how i could continue to be<br>international and global in my<br>perspectives while still being<br>rooted um in new zealand so it's been an<br>amazing process<br>and i hope that we can share um some of<br>our thoughts about what it is to<br>to lead and to direct an organization<br>that's predominantly young people um in<br>ontario and<br>sort of an organization that's really on<br>the cusp of traditional thinking in<br>terms of foreign policy as well<br>so really looking forward to the talk<br>and do feel free to ask questions<br>uh thomas and i usually talking in<br>person and it's usually very interactive<br>so this is the first time we've done it<br>in this way so if it feels a bit awkward<br>it's just because<br>we're we're usually in a room of people<br>so please do engage with us<br>and that will make it more cozy for us<br>evelyn so maybe i'll just talk a little<br>bit about<br>the organization how we got going who we<br>all are and<br>um yeah a little bit of the context of<br>of where we find ourselves right now as<br>a country in the world<br>um so i might just share my screen<br>let's see if i can do that<br>so there we go so this is this is our<br>beautiful<br>website that you can visit if you would<br>like to<br>uh nz alternative.org<br>so who are we so we're a group of<br>new zealanders who have diverse<br>backgrounds<br>and have been working on different<br>topics and<br>in different parts of the world<br>and all with a common interest in the<br>role that our country<br>plays in the world and so many of us<br>well a group of us got together i think<br>it was probably around about the<br>beginning of<br>2018 uh to start thinking about how<br>we could put some kind of organizational<br>structure around these<br>ideas and so we we went ahead and set up<br>this organization and we've been ticking<br>along<br>steadily since then so<br>we've got max harris who's based in<br>london<br>he's an author a phd student interested<br>in a range of<br>topics wrote a book called the new<br>zealand project in 2017<br>uh nina hall who is based in<br>bologna in italy although most mostly in<br>berlin now<br>working from there and she's also an<br>author and academic<br>and has a book coming up coming out soon<br>which we'll talk about later<br>myself evelyn who you've met um adama<br>rata who is a research fellow<br>at waikato um and our two<br>kind of newest people here in matarikika<br>and phoebe<br>who have just taken on the role as co<br>co-manager of the organization they're<br>sharing that and their twin sisters<br>which is cool<br>so aaron is a lawyer based in tanyatsu<br>in twohoy country<br>and phoebe is a teacher<br>and based in sweden so that's who we<br>are and yeah i guess the the origins of<br>the organization were<br>a desire to have or first of all more<br>conversations<br>as a country as people around the role<br>that our uh that our country is playing<br>in the world or could play in the world<br>and also a desire to maybe<br>democratize or open up access to<br>foreign policy discourse which tends to<br>be quite closed and dry<br>and well dominated really<br>uh by a narrow kind of band of people in<br>society<br>um excuse me so<br>so that was the that was the that was<br>the desire the impetus to set up an<br>organization<br>and and really since um since the<br>pandemic<br>hit we've we've been<br>thinking that new zealand has uh<br>probably a a really remarkably<br>significant role<br>uh to play in the world where we've had<br>this response that<br>allows us to do all the things that<br>we're very lucky to be able to do<br>compared to many other countries<br>and so we're getting quite a lot of<br>scrutiny internationally people are<br>looking at us and paying attention to us<br>in ways that they perhaps<br>haven't done before so that means<br>whatever we do now<br>we'll have a disproportionate impact so<br>so i think that's that's an opportunity<br>for us and and probably a responsibility<br>as well i'll just<br>before i stop talking and hand over to<br>evelyn give three examples<br>uh of areas where we think<br>although new zealand should should play<br>a role<br>given that we've got this increased<br>scrutiny um internationally so one<br>one is on migrant rights so migrant<br>workers<br>and migrants have have really been hit<br>hard by<br>the pandemic they've often been in many<br>countries they've been the worst hit<br>they often have less access to to public<br>services um<br>uh and that's to an extent being true in<br>an altitude or new zealand as well so<br>that's an area we think we should be<br>doing better at home as a country but<br>also advocating<br>for other countries to do better as well<br>the second area<br>is the the question of um just<br>transitions<br>and the there's been a lot of discussion<br>about how we're going to build back<br>better or how we're going to<br>kind of restructure or reset our<br>economies<br>after the pandemic and how how<br>there's such an imperative to do that in<br>a way that is compatible with<br>a safe climate and we think in doing<br>that there's a there's definitely a role<br>for<br>for us as a country to to given to<br>structuring our recovery our renewal our<br>reset from covert in a way that<br>bears in mind workers rights and<br>and the need for for a just transition<br>and the third area<br>is around international debt so many<br>countries that are<br>that are going to be suffering from from<br>the coronavirus<br>countries that are already settled by<br>billions of dollars of<br>debt over over decades<br>and i think there's a role for new<br>zealand to plan advocating for that<br>for that debt to be to be forgiven<br>so that's a little bit of an<br>introduction into<br>why why we came about as an organization<br>who we are in the context we're in now<br>i should stop sharing that<br>stop share or maybe i should keep<br>sharing evelyn should i keep sharing and<br>you want to<br>me to move you to a different part of<br>you know that sounds good do you want to<br>take us<br>to the our work section<br>you got it thank you<br>whereabouts how about here yeah that<br>sounds good<br>why don't we do that so i think<br>what i want to talk about briefly<br>is you've sort of you've met us<br>in terms of who we are in the<br>organization but<br>i think what's important to say is that<br>with the new zealand alternative we have<br>purposefully started working in a way<br>that has a very<br>a fla quite a flat hierarchy and so we<br>work<br>in in true collaboration which is why<br>you'll notice things such as<br>thomas and i being co-directors um and<br>then we have some<br>two co-managers that's erin and phoebe<br>and then we have um a steering group of<br>which we're all a part of to sort of<br>drive<br>our work and our ideas forward<br>into action and hopefully impact<br>so the idea behind that i think well<br>from my own personal perspective<br>is that over time in different<br>sort of situations employment situations<br>there was a frustration<br>of how slow as some structures can be<br>to work and how slow some<br>social organizations can have in terms<br>of making impact and so<br>what we wanted to do with a very small<br>budget<br>but a lot of energy was to make real<br>impact<br>and to and to work really<br>collaboratively and together<br>and somehow rather organically we have<br>this<br>amazing group of people where we all<br>come together in it and it's very warm<br>there's a lot of trust we all really<br>value each other's perspectives<br>and they're not always the same we all<br>share different<br>areas of expertise and so we rely on<br>each other for expertise but we<br>definitely<br>have a space that's open for discussion<br>when we all don't sort of agree on a<br>particular angle so<br>before i talk i thought it was important<br>to sort of understand how we work<br>before i talk about what we do<br>um so for those of you interested in<br>leadership i think it's important to<br>understand that in this new<br>environment we are able to work in<br>really agile<br>and remote ways and so as you've<br>probably picked up<br>with what thomas shared with who we are<br>we none of us<br>live near each other um we get together<br>on different platforms whether that's<br>zoom<br>or slack or or email um<br>and we sort of we keep up momentum in<br>that way facilitated by technology<br>and what that allows us to do is because<br>we're all in different places<br>around the world and also in new zealand<br>we're bringing and very current<br>and particular orientations to the work<br>depending on where we live<br>and who our communities are that we're<br>engaging with<br>in our home places so<br>uh thomas do you want to add anything to<br>that<br>no okay good okay so<br>so what we do is basically in a nutshell<br>originally or probably currently the the<br>conversation about<br>foreign policy and new zealand's role in<br>the world is often a very<br>it's often very dense type of discourse<br>it's difficult to engage with<br>most people around the kitchen table are<br>not talking about foreign policy in<br>any kind of recognizable way so what we<br>want to do<br>is we want to reignite and empower<br>people to start talking about new<br>zealand's role in the world<br>in a way that really resonates with<br>people and<br>and comes from a position of<br>understanding and caring and what it<br>means<br>for them so<br>what we've decided to do is that we<br>would<br>start these conversations in all these<br>different places<br>around new zealand's role in the world<br>and often around particular events that<br>are happening in the world that new<br>zealand has a role in<br>um so a lot of us have expertise in<br>writing and so<br>there's a range of writing projects that<br>happens they may be policy briefs<br>they may be short media articles<br>um or they may be edited books like the<br>one we're going to talk about<br>a little bit later and what that ryhoon<br>does is it really sort of it gets out<br>a different perspective on current<br>issues um<br>and it provides a very unique lookout<br>for on the new zealand government's role<br>in the world and how they approach<br>different<br>foreign policies at the time or<br>different global events so<br>at the moment new zealand alternative is<br>really the only organization that's<br>actively doing this<br>and it's a really important role we feel<br>for the new zealand community<br>here and overseas and the overseas<br>community to understand that there is an<br>organization having a look out<br>making some solid recommendations but<br>also holding<br>the government to account when we don't<br>think they're going down the right road<br>um so as i said the writing is<br>good in that way because it means that<br>it can reach not only the general public<br>but if it's a more sophisticated and<br>substantive report with clear policy<br>recommendations this is something that<br>we can take um<br>to government and use as a lobbying<br>device<br>the other mode of working is is the hoey<br>which i think new zealand has a really<br>strong tradition<br>in bringing people together um and<br>having conversations about particular<br>topics or issues<br>um and we wanted to to reignite<br>to reignite that format of conversation<br>um with foreign policy being<br>on the agenda so the idea is that<br>quite often it's thomas and i but<br>hopefully um<br>we'll have some some more hoey in person<br>with adama who's in new zealand as well<br>and aaron who<br>who's here too and to travel around the<br>country<br>and to really talk about foreign policy<br>and new zealand's role in the world from<br>a position of<br>very plain english using very concrete<br>examples for which people could start to<br>understand<br>what their role is in foreign policy in<br>ortera<br>and what their role is as a new<br>zealander and the rest of the world<br>and so far thomas and i have had a<br>series of these around the country<br>and i think as you can imagine um<br>people's perspectives uh change<br>depending on where you<br>are what the demographics are you know<br>at times<br>our conversations have been with people<br>that are<br>very useful um very young and<br>probably very sort of educated in the<br>foreign policy world and then in other<br>places it's been<br>starting from a really from from the<br>beginning of a conversation around what<br>foreign policy<br>is in new zealand and the way in which<br>we think new zealand should promote<br>um a strong values base to how we<br>operate<br>in in new zealand and also in the rest<br>of the world<br>so those are our two main angles of work<br>um and we feel that they've been really<br>effective<br>and i guess the third one is<br>is the more formal presentations like<br>this one and other events that we've put<br>on<br>in collaboration with other people like<br>kate rayworth on<br>on circular economies and donut<br>economics<br>um yeah so i guess<br>maybe it would be good to look at some<br>of the examples of what we've done<br>thomas so people know where they can<br>find<br>great idea evelyn let me just go and<br>find some<br>so i'm going to give some examples so if<br>i go to here<br>so here's a couple of things that we did<br>um<br>this one here or this one here was a<br>first one that we did and this was a<br>it's quite a long report it's probably<br>about<br>50 60 pages and it<br>it kind of analyzes the the role that we<br>could play as a country<br>in conflict prevention and peace<br>mediation<br>uh and proposes some some<br>recommendations<br>uh around how we could do that including<br>the idea of<br>setting up the country setting up a an<br>independent<br>conflict prevention unit maybe i'll talk<br>a little bit about<br>that as an idea um<br>because we we we wanted to when we<br>established the organization we wanted<br>to<br>uh come into the world with an idea that<br>could give people an idea of<br>you know what do we mean by a<br>progressive role in the world for<br>altering new zealand so so we we chose<br>this topic as an example of<br>something that we believe our country<br>could do in the world<br>that would be that would be helpful<br>constructive<br>and that would be a sorry for us all to<br>be<br>proud of and so we<br>we looked around uh consulted for<br>topics and and we chose this one this<br>conflict prevention one and<br>part of the reason for that was that and<br>if you if you want to have a dig into<br>the report<br>you'll you'll see what we mean but<br>this country really actually has a<br>strong and rich<br>history of peace and<br>of conflict prevention that's not to say<br>that we're we're<br>necessarily a peaceful country we've<br>we've<br>got quite a militarist history as well<br>and you know our founding national kind<br>of<br>story or myth if you like is gallipoli<br>which is obviously<br>100 militarist in nature but<br>there have also been some great icons<br>of our history um<br>sheppard herself peter fraser<br>who helped negotiate the un charter<br>in 1945 these people are all<br>stalwarts of a strong<br>thread and commitment<br>of peace and conflict prevention in our<br>country so we<br>we saw that kind of historical<br>link to to peace and conflict prevention<br>in in new zealand as a<br>as a basis for this and we also looked<br>at our recent history so<br>the work that the new zealand government<br>did<br>in bergenville in the 1990s and helping<br>to<br>negotiate uh or facilitate uh<br>discussions<br>uh towards peace in the civil war uh in<br>bergenville<br>in papua new guinea in the 1990s and we<br>we interviewed a whole lot of people<br>former prime ministers former foreign<br>ministers<br>ambassadors activists academics<br>to to talk about how how best we could<br>we could play a role as a country in the<br>space of preventing conflicts and<br>promoting peace and so that's quite a<br>detailed<br>research document with with some chunky<br>uh recommendations that we that we<br>costed out so so that's one example of a<br>piece of work that we've done we haven't<br>done anything quite as detailed as that<br>since then that was a big piece of work<br>but we are certainly<br>that's that's the kind of piece of work<br>that we<br>that we can do in the future and then<br>the other this is this is a<br>another one that we did more recently<br>last year<br>uh that looks this is a different sort<br>of a<br>document it's more it's shorter<br>and more narrow in focus<br>and perhaps more contemporary and and<br>that's looking at the idea of<br>the the way in which we could<br>we could prevent more civilian<br>casualties from the operations of the<br>new zealand defence forces overseas<br>and that kind of relates to the<br>operation<br>burnham inquiry that has just recently<br>completed<br>that was looking into some incidents<br>in 2010 um incidents<br>in which the new zealand special<br>special forces were involved in<br>the deaths of civilians in afghanistan<br>and so that also uh proposes some quite<br>detailed recommendations about what<br>uh what the government could do what the<br>defence force could do<br>to prevent to help prevent<br>any civilian deaths from<br>uh from operations involving new zealand<br>defence force<br>in future um so those are a couple of<br>the research products that we've done<br>and then i'll just quickly go<br>and show you<br>some other work that we've done which is<br>writing short opinion pieces so we've<br>um we're all quite opinionated and so<br>we've<br>uh we've written some opinion pieces<br>around<br>you know how do we make the election a<br>contest of ideas<br>um how do we use our a new found<br>uh international attention after beating<br>the coronavirus yeah<br>i've spoken to that a bit already uh how<br>about we ban fossil fuels<br>uh any thoughts on that love to hear<br>them in the discussion<br>um you know colonialism<br>climate displacement well-being budget<br>so yeah we've had quite a i was looking<br>at this earlier and thinking hey wow<br>everyone this looks<br>this looks really impressive we've done<br>we've done a lot of stuff<br>so if you feel like having a look at<br>that you can<br>you can have a dive in and and a dig<br>around<br>but that's uh there's some examples of<br>the sorts of things that we're doing<br>you<br>oh okay um<br>i was going to talk a little bit around<br>what's coming up<br>in the very short term which is<br>um a book that's been edited by<br>one of our members dr nina hall<br>and it actually features contributions<br>from<br>a few of our steering group members<br>thomas has done<br>the ending the conclusion i think yeah<br>um and max harris has a piece in there<br>as well<br>um which is fantastic so i'm just<br>i'm just going to read off what it has<br>written on the bwb website<br>in terms of its blue because it's just<br>come out the last couple of days<br>um it says new zealand looks out to a<br>turbulent world<br>long-standing alliances are fracturing<br>nationalism is surging<br>and the oceans are rising the<br>contributors within these pages are not<br>as editor nina hall notes conventional<br>foreign policy<br>voices but these are far from<br>conventional<br>times these contributors<br>ask us that we fundamentally rethink<br>otero's role in the world<br>and offer practical ideas grounded in<br>progressive values and evidence<br>so it's a it's a classic bwb<br>text where it's edited by someone that's<br>got fantastic networks<br>and a great mind for bringing together a<br>range of different topics<br>and perspectives and nina's done an<br>amazing<br>job of doing that and i think if you<br>wanted to read something and dive<br>into a range of<br>foreign policy issues and sort of try to<br>think through how they may be connected<br>whether or not this is<br>chinese and relationships<br>and in different types of economic<br>theories and how we can<br>do do better um it's really worthwhile<br>um checking it out you can get an online<br>version as well as a paper copy<br>um i do know that dr nina hall will be<br>doing<br>a live event from bologna and i think<br>available to ask some questions around<br>the process of<br>of editing the book and so and i'm sure<br>that new zealand alternative will have<br>some sort of an event to mark this<br>amazing milestone and<br>so really encourage you to check it out<br>buy it get it from the library um<br>i have to make an apology i've got a new<br>puppy you might be able to hear him<br>outside my door um<br>sorry about that um hopefully the whanau<br>will take him inside in a minute<br>um so that's what's coming out um in the<br>short term<br>is the book that's due out next month in<br>august so that's pretty exciting<br>um one of the other big pieces of work<br>that we're working on at the moment<br>is actually rethinking our whole<br>strategic direction<br>so that we are more aligned<br>and more appropriately positioned to<br>discuss<br>constant constitutional transformation<br>in orteroa<br>so this has been a really interesting<br>process and particularly for myself<br>as to iwi you know i'm a migrant i'm not<br>sanga tofinoa but we have<br>some incredible wahine toa that have<br>joined<br>our group and under their guidance<br>we have started to reconsider<br>our position on foreign policy in terms<br>of<br>not being able to really consider what<br>new zealand's role in the world<br>is until we have a solid and just and<br>fair<br>constitution that underpins our our<br>legal system and new zealand and our<br>government in new zealand<br>so we've started to think more along the<br>lines<br>of how new zealand's role in the world<br>can align with a better understanding<br>and a recognition that in the treaty of<br>waitangi<br>it's been recognized that maori did not<br>see sovereignty<br>um to the crown and so therefore if that<br>relationship<br>is not appropriate appropriately upheld<br>and appropriately thought through<br>and if maori is not repositioned into a<br>position of power within utero<br>new zealand how can we begin to think<br>about new zealand's role<br>in the world and our role with<br>particularly migrant communities coming<br>into new zealand<br>and so this has been a bit unraveling i<br>think for me<br>um in a sense i've had to really<br>honestly think about<br>um how i understand foreign policy<br>um from the point of view of the<br>tangents<br>and of course one of one of our key<br>missions<br>is to never have um a singular voice<br>on what that is like and i think<br>actually if you dive into any of the<br>thinking around constitutional<br>transformation<br>in new zealand you'll find the likes of<br>you know margaret motu and moana jackson<br>have really<br>cleverly been able to bring to the fore<br>the fact that any changes to our<br>constitution<br>has to include diverse voices<br>um whether that be from different<br>communities from different<br>demographic cohorts um particularly for<br>young people<br>um so that's really important and so a<br>lot of a lot of the way we work<br>really aligns well with the work that's<br>going on with the thinking around<br>constitutional transformation<br>um and it's all you know it's an amazing<br>inspiring<br>sort of movement to to join up with and<br>to be a part of it and so<br>really what we're looking to do in the<br>future is to<br>to pivot our conversations in the<br>communities hui<br>around new zealand's role in the world<br>and what that means<br>under a reimagined constitution<br>reimagined and and reimagine power<br>relationships<br>um within maori the crown and also<br>the migrant communities in aotearoa<br>um we also think that by honestly<br>and really substantively considering our<br>position on constitutional<br>transformation<br>it will allow us to be better leaders in<br>the rest of the world<br>um for other independence and<br>sovereignty movements so<br>this is something i feel really strongly<br>about in the pacific<br>um as you know independence and<br>sovereignty struggles can<br>continue within our region but also<br>globally as well<br>and so we see this as a real opportunity<br>for new zealand<br>to to consider its<br>itself constitutionally reconsider that<br>and really show leadership in terms of<br>allowing the sovereignty<br>um to be gained for indigenous people<br>and helping other communities restart<br>this conversation as well<br>maybe not restart but maybe amplify i<br>guess it's always there<br>you want to add anything thomas that was<br>great<br>uh i was getting sort of<br>spine tingling feeling when you were<br>talking about the constitutional<br>transformation stuff it is pretty it's<br>pretty big and i mean you know if we<br>if we are going to do one thing as a<br>country that would make a difference<br>in the world it would be to<br>show that it is possible uh in this<br>early 21st century to<br>give power back to indigenous peoples uh<br>in the context of white settler<br>colonial governments um so yeah that's<br>that's a that's kind of where we are<br>um i might say a few words now about how<br>you can get involved if you want to<br>and then we'll probably use like the<br>last little bit of the session<br>to have a q a i'm just checking over<br>he's not giving me any uh feedback<br>around that but we could have a bit of a<br>q a couldn't we<br>yeah yeah we could yeah um so so that's<br>good<br>so what i'll do is i'll show you a<br>little bit<br>about how you can<br>if i just hide that move that up here go<br>to here<br>yeah so this is where you can<br>get involved just fill in that form<br>pretty simple um<br>and yeah if you've got ideas about<br>things that you'd like to write or<br>create with us that relate to<br>the role of our country in the world<br>we'd love to hear from you through this<br>form<br>if you think that you and your friends<br>or your whanau<br>or any groups that you're involved with<br>would like to<br>host or be involved in a community hui<br>then we'd love to<br>hear from you as well and nowadays with<br>zoom it's pretty easy<br>to to do a community hook because you<br>can just uh<br>jump on the zoom so yeah please do get<br>in touch<br>we're very relaxed and open might take<br>us<br>a few days to get back to you but we we<br>will get back to you<br>um okay i'm going to stop the share and<br>see<br>see whether we've got any appetite for<br>discussion and if we don't then<br>we've got some pre-prepared additional<br>points that we can use to<br>either provoke further discussion or<br>just give you more material<br>there's i might just jump in there<br>thomas and<br>um remind you and<br>everyone else that we have a pretty good<br>facebook page<br>instagram page and twitter at the moment<br>as well so<br>if you want to keep up to date with what<br>we're doing that's probably the best<br>place to head to<br>we also have a newsletter that comes out<br>um<br>so if you want to sort of just keep in<br>touch with us<br>that way um please do but yeah really<br>want to echo<br>what thomas said about you know<br>partnering<br>with whanau or organizations to hold hui<br>um we really do want to get out and talk<br>to<br>as many people as we can and um as<br>thomas said they're<br>they're always informal and always<br>interesting and yeah<br>brave enough to ask a question or make a<br>comment<br>concrete steps concrete next steps for<br>constitutional transformation<br>well what do you think if i mean i would<br>say<br>that the one<br>one concrete step is<br>to get the crown to respond or to<br>institute some kind of process to<br>respond to the recommendations in the<br>2016 uh matakimai<br>report which was done by margaret matu<br>and<br>moana jackson on behalf of the<br>ew cheers forum<br>so that that report has a whole lot of<br>really concrete material that needs to<br>be engaged with by the crowd<br>so that would be one that would be one<br>concrete next step<br>in terms of what we're going to do we we<br>are going to have more conversations<br>because that process of mata kimai<br>was the result well it was a process of<br>a huge number of conversations hundreds<br>of conversations around the country<br>in different forms uh and so we we want<br>to contribute to<br>building on that uh and in particular<br>building on that with toei<br>and and putting our audience it's not<br>not just that but<br>but certainly to to bring that<br>to bring those audiences in to do some<br>of that mahi<br>which is is going to be really important<br>as well<br>um yeah i probably i'd be probably<br>slightly reluctant<br>to think to to present an opinion on<br>what the concrete next steps should be<br>for constitutional transformation<br>because<br>that's obviously gotta it's gotta come<br>out of a out of the process but the<br>mataki mai report<br>does uh have uh some<br>some brilliant ideas on where to go next<br>but ev what would you say<br>um i think for us<br>it's about and we've been thinking a lot<br>about<br>how we do this but at new zealand<br>alternative we're trying to think about<br>different types of metaphors that we can<br>use to start the conversation about<br>constitutional transformation<br>and this goes back to what thomas was<br>talking about<br>before in terms of like how we came<br>together and what we're trying to do<br>and to include diverse voices we have to<br>find diverse ways of talking about<br>constitutional transformation<br>so it's a real mouthful people<br>if you say it they just kind of glaze<br>over and think oh i i<br>yeah whatever i don't know what that is<br>i'm not going to google it<br>i don't think i've read about it and<br>stuff um<br>i can't be bothered and so it really is<br>about<br>getting to the core of what<br>constitutional transformation is and<br>that's about<br>shifting power and and it's about<br>recognizing that the power balance<br>isn't isn't cool like it's not fair you<br>know and<br>and that has had lots of different types<br>of ramifications in terms of<br>ongoing inequality for time at the<br>funeral right<br>and so from our perspective<br>we we need to find a way to talk about<br>constitutional transformation and to<br>bring people into the conversation<br>so that they feel sort of embodied in<br>part of<br>what is unjust and that unjust um<br>power imbalance and so we've got some<br>great<br>more useful than thomas and i people on<br>the group now<br>who are really plugged into different<br>types of<br>art and music theater<br>weaving networks and so we're trying to<br>think about different ways to<br>to use that medium to sort of really<br>discuss what<br>what's central to constitutional<br>transformation which is power<br>um and gifting that power back well one<br>recognizing that the power imbalance<br>exists and then two shifting the power<br>um is essentially what we want to do<br>um we are really lucky we just spent um<br>a few days in taniatua and suhoy and<br>that's a really<br>that was a really significant event for<br>us because we were able to<br>really feel the water of a place that is<br>really significant in terms of<br>sovereignty movements<br>in utero and also spend time with<br>tamaiti who is able to sort of provide<br>us with some really<br>amazing guidance in terms of what it<br>means to be you know young activists how<br>we take care of each other<br>and how we engage with different<br>communities<br>and and the answer there is<br>sort of quietly and simply you know and<br>so that's<br>that's i think that's what you what what<br>we want to do<br>um it's definitely i think we definitely<br>had to watch this space<br>moment in the organization because we<br>have grown<br>quite rapidly over the last six months<br>and we are really needing to rethink<br>our foundation um and so once that is as<br>settled<br>and and we've come to find a platform<br>from which to<br>launch ourselves into this conversation<br>and<br>there will be more out there yeah<br>another reason<br>yeah when you uh<br>if you're thinking about getting um more<br>more questions in there please do do<br>feel free to<br>drop something in the chat or you know<br>even<br>raise your hand and we can um<br>we can put you up on the screen um<br>but yeah i was thinking like one one<br>thing that one could imagine is that<br>you know perhaps there could be direct<br>from<br>more direct relationships between<br>and other countries or other indigenous<br>peoples<br>in in in a similar way<br>or in a complementary way to the way<br>that the<br>crown on our behalf has um<br>foreign relations with other countries<br>through its embassies and high<br>commissions<br>so that's that's uh that's one concrete<br>idea that relates to constitutional<br>transformation<br>and and foreign policy that um that<br>certainly would<br>uh would be worth exploring and i think<br>there's<br>there's a lot that could be gained by<br>having<br>more well-resourced and perhaps slightly<br>more formalized<br>relationships between um yeah between<br>and amongst<br>indigenous peoples we could have a<br>strong role to play there<br>as a country right any other<br>we don't know what this um what this<br>format is<br>is usually like so we're<br>we're we're we're often in context where<br>there's<br>lots of highly opinionated people it's<br>also yeah we can't see you all<br>perhaps i have an example that's quite<br>relevant i guess<br>in terms of constitutional<br>transformation and<br>a different sort of hapu and eewee<br>really take responsibility for their<br>communities well-being<br>um and they they secured that power<br>and they asserted that power to keep<br>their community safe<br>and this is something that i think<br>other indigenous communities around the<br>world have been looking<br>to because indigenous communities have<br>not<br>had a good history of disease<br>and pandemics um and so having<br>seeing that exercise of power i think<br>recently<br>um it demonstrates that there is a shift<br>in there as a movement<br>and so when you're trying to think about<br>an example of a case of what this<br>constitutional transformation looks like<br>and it looks like communities<br>taking responsibility for their health<br>and their well-being<br>and doing it in their culturally<br>appropriate way<br>yeah so you know i think it's through<br>sharing these examples and making those<br>linkages between what's going on today<br>and what we're trying to work towards<br>that's that's where<br>i'm not really sure where to go from<br>here either we could have a break<br>we could have a break but i cannot<br>believe that we hadn't said anything at<br>all that has not<br>provoked some<br>thinking but that's okay<br>what do you think what do you think<br>producer yeah well i could pose a<br>question for you guys<br>correct um are there any countries out<br>there that you think<br>are actually succeeding in implementing<br>some of the values that you guys are<br>after<br>wow what do you think of do you want to<br>go schlocker<br>well i mean you can go i mean we've got<br>quite a sweeping menu of what values we<br>feel<br>should be just underpinned foreign<br>policy and i'm not sure<br>any country is going to get the<br>composition exactly right<br>um to be honest i'm i've got more of a<br>look out on the countries that do it<br>really badly<br>um so thomas maybe you could like<br>share i mean you've got some good<br>insights with scandinavian countries<br>and i i do think it's important to say<br>that otero new zealand<br>does get it right sometimes and that we<br>do actually i think<br>more recently we have seen values<br>underpin<br>our foreign policy particularly with you<br>know with empathy<br>and is one that that's come forward um<br>altruism or generosity comes comes<br>through quite a lot as well with our<br>foreign policy<br>um but yeah i'll let thomas<br>take take that one yeah so it's a good<br>question and i<br>to be honest i don't think there is any<br>country in the world that is um<br>that is approaching foreign policy in<br>the way that<br>we are suggesting alter or new zealand<br>should<br>approach foreign policy and i think that<br>there's a<br>there's an issue here uh which cuts i<br>guess to the heart<br>of traditional foreign policy discourse<br>which is this question of<br>net the national interest uh and the<br>idea of competing national interests<br>and how you know traditional foreign<br>policy you're supposed to balance your<br>competing<br>national interests with the idea of<br>having some form of<br>coherent international cooperation and<br>that's why after the second world war<br>and<br>uh we developed collectively a whole set<br>of structures<br>um the rules-based order as we often<br>hear about in<br>in this country and elsewhere uh to uh<br>to allow us to cooperate so you know the<br>united nations<br>or trade organization uh the<br>world bank and the international<br>monetary fund and all of the kind of<br>suite of international legal instruments<br>and treaties<br>that help us to cooperate in this kind<br>of multilateral system<br>now there are some countries that are<br>really good at using that for<br>positive for many positive<br>ends and i'd say that new zealand is<br>probably one of those norway is another<br>one<br>that is very good at doing that i'd say<br>ireland<br>is another one mexico south africa<br>uh strong multilateralists but then many<br>of these countries uh<br>have their own problems as well so we<br>can be<br>we can we can celebrate norway<br>for its multilateralism and its<br>humanitarian leadership<br>but we can also criticize norway for<br>its massive reliance on fossil fuel<br>its role in the arms trade<br>and its role in you know whaling killing<br>whales which we don't really like<br>um so it's it's kind of hard to<br>us to get a<br>uh a kind of clear sense that<br>one one country is doing everything<br>right i think you'll see some countries<br>have pockets of excellence in certain<br>areas<br>um but in terms of uh<br>in terms of a country that's doing<br>everything right i don't think there is<br>one but<br>i guess maybe to finish off on this<br>question i would say that<br>um what i what i would like us to do as<br>a country<br>is is to work more closely with other<br>maybe small smaller and medium sized<br>countries<br>that are interested in how to solve some<br>of these challenges<br>uh and just to have have a discussion<br>with them<br>about how we can do that and to not<br>necessarily say oh hey we're so great<br>or hey we all as a group are really so<br>great but actually just to kind of go<br>into more of a collective<br>problem-solving mode and say hey we're<br>all<br>we're all facing these issues of<br>planetary boundaries<br>and climate and pollution and<br>consumers consumerist extractive<br>economies and we're<br>trying to think of how we could build<br>something new maybe we could exchange<br>views on that so i think that would be<br>really good and i think countries like<br>ireland<br>chile would be<br>you know norway there are others<br>who who would be quite keen to have<br>those discussions with us obviously our<br>neighbors in the pacific as well i'm<br>seeing some more<br>questions coming in here uh<br>this one how is self-interest certain<br>groups maintaining power an issue for<br>constitutional transformation<br>and how do we keep these things neutral<br>removing personal biases<br>yeah well i think that's right i mean<br>it's<br>cuts right to the heart of it you know<br>the that is that that is the main<br>barrier<br>i would say uh to having<br>even a discussion let alone a uh<br>some some concrete responses to<br>uh to constitutional transformation it's<br>incredibly threatening<br>as a discussion for<br>most entrenched uh groups with power<br>in our society most people i just do not<br>want to talk about it<br>so that makes it hard to<br>to start talking about it and how do we<br>how do we keep things neutral yeah i<br>that's hard but i think we just need to<br>be we need to be kind of<br>really thoughtful in our communications<br>and really<br>listen generously um and probably also<br>have different groups<br>that are willing to do the work to talk<br>to different groups<br>so you know people like me i've got lots<br>of<br>privilege and you know maybe i should be<br>on the front lines of talking to other<br>people with lots of privilege<br>because that's that's the hardest work<br>um evan can you see these questions as<br>well<br>and this is yeah i can i've i've got a<br>couple i've got one on the webinar<br>chat as well and then one over here so<br>i'm gonna<br>i'm gonna respond to cynthia's question<br>um okay cool cynthia writes i'm in the<br>process of establishing a startup that<br>collaborates with pacific islands<br>including psalm one<br>how do i find out what foreign policies<br>have an effect on establishment of an<br>effective collaboration<br>well that's a really good question um<br>i guess any foreign policies to do with<br>the pacific<br>from otiero new zealand you will find<br>with the<br>ministry of foreign affairs and trade<br>however<br>you would need to look at the foreign<br>policies<br>from each of the countries that you were<br>wanting to establish a collaboration<br>with<br>um one note on foreign policies though<br>is that if you are wanting to i'm not<br>sure what this<br>organization is and feel free to reach<br>out to me personally and we can maybe<br>take this conversation offline um<br>but it may be that the foreign policies<br>just provide you with an understanding<br>of the political landscape into which<br>you want to anchor<br>your mahi or your work or all these<br>relationships and so<br>it's always a good idea to check in and<br>to see what the landscape is and to see<br>what the sort of permission space<br>is for you to to start your work<br>um and to check in with some of the key<br>players there as well<br>to to get support um<br>if you're an activist then if it's an<br>activist organization then i guess<br>the the role of the foreign policy is<br>to understand what you uh what you want<br>to come up against<br>and what you want to challenge and so<br>then the foreign policies have<br>a different role to play so it is really<br>worthwhile checking into them and to try<br>to understand<br>what your group's position will be on<br>the different foreign policies<br>and that that's tricky in the pacific<br>because<br>there's going to be a lot to have a look<br>at um<br>i think you also probably have to think<br>a little bit more broadly around the<br>role of<br>other countries in the pacific in terms<br>of<br>australia the us taiwan china<br>as well and you know and the eu actually<br>funds a lot of work<br>in the pacific too so beyond just<br>otero and the pacific there's a whole<br>lot of other actors which i think<br>need to be thought through and included<br>and also the role of big<br>non-government organizations so the<br>likes of the world bank<br>asian development bank the world health<br>organization<br>the un and the eu corporation<br>um but yes happy to have this court at<br>all<br>um in a later stage if you want to flip<br>me an email i'm evelyn at<br>new zealand alternative.org<br>um i had something else on that<br>actually that i was going to say to<br>cynthia and that was just the pacific<br>islands forum<br>is there's quite a lot of resources<br>around that<br>that um because it happens every year<br>and they<br>you know and that's a place where<br>pacific islands can come suffocating<br>states can come and<br>talk about issues that are of common<br>concern so that<br>the you know the pacific islands uh<br>forum<br>there's a secretary and that's probably<br>got quite a lot of documents that<br>would would give you a bit of a resource<br>base for<br>some of the foreign policy issues that<br>are that are being discussed at that<br>it's very theme-based though so it will<br>decide on what the hot topics<br>are okay yeah that's yeah one thing to<br>to think about um<br>do you want to take karen's one thomas<br>how can we showcase new zealand<br>as an example for value-based leadership<br>and inclusion of the world and as<br>we still have much work to do here in<br>new zealand when are we credible roles<br>yeah yeah yeah what sort of role models<br>or frameworks can we promote that really<br>translate to other countries<br>yeah so we haven't worked on any of the<br>tools as such<br>yet um but it's a good idea actually of<br>thinking about<br>how there could be models or frameworks<br>um<br>yeah i mean i think this this this<br>tension<br>that you point to between<br>what we say and what we do is that is<br>the fundamental tension<br>in any of this work for us and that's<br>actually why<br>as evelyn said earlier we've come to the<br>conclusion well we've come to the<br>point of understanding that really<br>before we go any further in terms of<br>promoting uh necessarily what we think<br>the alter or new zealand should be doing<br>in the world we<br>need to refocus our work as an<br>organization on constitutional<br>transformation because<br>that's really the starting point uh for<br>having uh having a i think when we can<br>when we can do that then we can then we<br>can<br>truly be credible as a role model<br>but having said that you don't want to<br>leave it until we've reached some kind<br>of<br>idealized point of perfection in our<br>domestic arrangements<br>before having a view on the rest of the<br>world because<br>you know then then we couldn't provide<br>any uh input<br>and i think people uh around the world<br>are desperate for input you know<br>i i see this from friends overseas<br>saying i wish we had your prime minister<br>and all of that so there's definitely a<br>role for us to play<br>and i think i think the prime minister's<br>doing a decent job<br>what we would like to see is more<br>resource<br>put around initiatives and<br>more resource around yeah that that kind<br>of<br>genuine leadership that is open about<br>how<br>much we still need to do at home but<br>that also<br>as i said earlier wants to open up<br>communication and cooperation with other<br>countries that are<br>that are facing the same challenges<br>i guess that leads into that next<br>question from<br>finnian from the idea of cross national<br>collaboration<br>and discussion what that actually looked<br>like you think who would be a discussion<br>table<br>how would you try to ensure action is<br>taken seeing as especially outside of<br>government across national legislation<br>um yeah i'm just looking at my producer<br>again to see<br>huh<br>okay okay okay so i'm going to take this<br>question and then we'll transition to<br>the next<br>um that where we're going to have more<br>of this kind of q a<br>so yeah it's a very good question for me<br>and<br>i guess my answer will be we're<br>we don't have a fixed view and we would<br>we will i mean i i'm i'm kind of used to<br>in my professional career discussions<br>between mainly diplomats<br>and also ngos<br>organizations and i think that kind of<br>cooperation<br>is is useful but as as we said in the<br>at the outset we're interested in<br>widening that out more broadly so<br>that could be cross-cultural cooperation<br>between<br>artists and musicians and<br>people who are involved in an industry<br>and in different parts of society<br>we i think legislation and you know<br>international treaties and multilateral<br>treaties and agreements is one<br>there's one thing but probably we can do<br>quite a lot even before we get to that<br>stage so even just conversations um<br>and forums and you know i was thinking<br>we're we're going to be hosting<br>apec next year and we're doing it on a<br>virtual<br>virtual kind of platform and<br>i think it starts at the end of this<br>year actually so that's the first time<br>apec would have been held virtually and<br>i think that's a that's a good<br>opportunity for us as a country to start<br>to think about well how could we<br>maybe model some new forms of<br>multilateral<br>multi-state discussions on a virtual<br>on a virtual basis that would probably<br>allow even even greater<br>access and participation<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
