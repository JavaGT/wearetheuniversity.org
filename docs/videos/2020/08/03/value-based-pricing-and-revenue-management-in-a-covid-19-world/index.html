How do airlines survive a cashflow nightmare? Airline and hotel prices in New Zealand’s hubs are being determined by government policies requiring the quarantining of international arrivals, so what does this mean for revenue management and the impact of domestic travellers? To the tourist who is searching for the best value, price comparison has become the norm, so what does this all mean for selling, distribution and marketing of hotel and travel products? <br><br><br><br>We have asked three of the world’s leading experts on revenue management and value-based pricing to answer these questions. Hear from Sherri Kimes (Cornell University), Ben Vinod (Sabre Technologies) and Stephan Liozu (Thales Group) in this webinar recorded on 22 July 2020.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

revenue management<br>in a corvette 19 world i apologize for<br>some of the technical issues that we had<br>at the beginning but those are problems<br>with share screen<br>but we have a plan b like all good<br>revenue managers<br>and today we're living in a world of<br>constant change<br>and we've gone from the concept of order<br>tourism<br>to the concept of no tourism virtually<br>overnight<br>and demand has has whittled away so the<br>big question<br>is what is the role of revenue<br>management in this new world<br>how do you manage demand and match<br>demand with supply<br>what are the tools and techniques we can<br>use with revenue management pricing<br>what do we mean by value there's a whole<br>range of questions that have that have<br>come out of corvette 19<br>and today we have three speakers from<br>across the world<br>who are international under and the<br>leading experts within their field<br>we have sorry<br>we have stefan<br>lisu from the united states from the<br>united states<br>um who's basically one of the world's<br>leading experts<br>in pricing we have sherry caines<br>who is a professor at cornell hotel<br>school<br>i'm ben bernard from<br>um from seva sorry i apologize i'm just<br>smiling<br>um can i ask any<br>participants today if you would like to<br>ask a question<br>please use the q and a button which<br>you'll find at the bottom of your screen<br>and please use this to ask questions and<br>the panelists and myself will answer<br>those questions at the end of<br>pre-present at the end of the three<br>presentations<br>so the first presenter is<br>is stefan um<br>who is basically one of the world's<br>leading experts in pricing<br>i've known stefan through the journal of<br>revenue and pricing management<br>and he's the author of many books<br>including including<br>including value and pricing<br>sorry i'm still smiling so without any<br>further ado i'm going to introduce<br>stephan<br>stefan would you like to share your<br>screen yes<br>hello everyone i'm gonna share my screen<br>and uh show you uh<br>a few slides on the topic of uh<br>value-based pricing uh<br>you know which is very timely obviously<br>uh as we have uh<br>a bit of turbulences in the world uh so<br>uh it is always interesting uh you know<br>when you uh<br>you talk about value when you know lots<br>of things are moving chaotically around<br>the world and uh<br>and and with consumers um and as you<br>know<br>uh most companies do not do value-based<br>pricing they do cost plus pricing which<br>is uh<br>even worse in a crisis when everything<br>is going all over the map<br>but today we are going to focus on<br>value-based pricing<br>and um i want to just do a little quick<br>reminder of for<br>for the audience of uh what is<br>value-based pricing and because uh<br>in one of the findings that i you know<br>i've done many many years of research on<br>the topic<br>uh including getting my phd on the<br>subject and<br>there are many definitions of what<br>value-based pricing is the<br>conceptualization of it<br>how do you do it and even consultants<br>are not getting<br>you know the same definitions not like<br>six sigma where everybody uses the same<br>definition<br>in value-based pricing is pretty much<br>all over the map so<br>if you look at literature and if you<br>look at what's written in in terms of<br>pricing orientation<br>you have three main commonly accepted<br>pricing orientation you're going to do<br>your price setting based on cost<br>you're going to do it based on<br>competition you know in very intense<br>competitive uh<br>you know industries and then you're<br>going to do it on value<br>right now the reality of a price selling<br>um and price getting is in fact you will<br>you will use the three c's you will lose<br>cost competition and customer to set<br>your price<br>and obviously you know depending on<br>where you are<br>you know what industry you're in and<br>what kind of systems you use<br>you know this price setting will be<br>based on algorithms<br>derived from the transactional data your<br>cost data<br>or you know if you do a scrubbing of<br>competitive information<br>you know you could put rules in your<br>systems to match your competitors or to<br>always be a percent over your<br>competitors a lot of different things<br>that go behind you<br>but pretty much if you look at this then<br>you know the question becomes is it<br>becomes<br>which orientation do you actually uh<br>primarily use<br>and in a group like my group you know i<br>work for talis it's a<br>it's a 19 billion euro uh company<br>located in france and i i work in the us<br>we are using the three c's uh we're<br>moving towards more value-based pricing<br>but in essence we<br>are a manufacturing traditional<br>engineering company<br>producing radars and equipment for<br>airplanes and<br>all kinds of different beautiful<br>technologies but we are a cost driven<br>organization<br>because you know we are a project a<br>product maker<br>so moving towards value-based pricing is<br>kind of a journey for us<br>but as we move in and increase the the<br>level of um<br>adoption i will say here comes the covet<br>crisis and<br>obviously uh changes a lot of the uh<br>all the work that we've done for the<br>last five years as far as<br>you know not only internally how the<br>team reacts to the uncertainty<br>but also how the customers and the<br>partners<br>including governments how do we purchase<br>how do we procure<br>and and you know all that<br>changes in customer perceptions<br>understanding of the worth<br>of differentiation you know acceptance<br>of premium<br>everything is pretty much collapsed over<br>the last three months<br>so you know it's important when you talk<br>about value-based pricing that you<br>discuss the concept of customer value<br>because um you know this is the heart of<br>uh of you know of the methodology<br>i am the chief value officer of the<br>telus group so all i do day in day out<br>is manage customer value and its value<br>extraction<br>value quantification and value capture<br>through pricing so<br>but in essence value is an exchange if<br>you look at the definition from<br>anderson and narrows which is you know a<br>very very uh<br>well-cited paper it's an exchange<br>between the price you pay<br>and what you're getting in return for<br>what you buy right it's an exchange of<br>value and price<br>so in essence uh the council of<br>value-based pricing is grounded in that<br>exchange<br>where customers whether b2c b2b or b2g<br>government will kind of look at you know<br>what are the benefits that i'm getting<br>and what is the price that i'm going to<br>pay for<br>whatever that i'm buying and that's<br>essential<br>when you when you consider value-based<br>pricing in a crisis where pretty much<br>the perceptions of value the definition<br>of the worth the utilities<br>and the benefits are totally changed<br>it's kind of an earthquake<br>in the perception of value so that<br>exchange then becomes uh<br>i would say disoriented or unbalanced uh<br>towards more of a<br>uh i would say pricing pressure and<br>and the willingness from customers<br>consumers to make sacrifices<br>in how they select and position and rank<br>the offers that they can choose from<br>right<br>so value-based pricing is a methodology<br>i adopt the six steps of value-based<br>pricing<br>and it's right here you have them on the<br>screen and i'm going to go through very<br>quickly one by one<br>um and it's not four it's not 10<br>although there's<br>plenty of definitions out there this is<br>been around for 30 years developed by<br>tom nago the the guru of<br>pricing strategy and tactics uh um so<br>first of all you need to understand your<br>competition and then do very deep<br>customer segmentation<br>you know this is a primary uh the<br>pillars of value-based pricing<br>and then that leads to the step number<br>three which is really understanding your<br>true differentiation what makes you<br>unique versus competition<br>and that concept of differentiation is<br>obviously focused on perceived<br>differentiation<br>right and that changes between b2c b2b<br>and b2g<br>where in b2c will have a lot more<br>emotional and brand equity<br>and a lot more psychological uh effect<br>on the differentiation where in b2b<br>and b2g it'll be a lot more rational as<br>far as how much money are you gonna save<br>me<br>so uh you know a rational evaluation of<br>a key differentiation<br>then we get into the quantification of<br>value which is probably one of the most<br>difficult<br>aspect of value-based pricing which is<br>you know doing economic value estimation<br>and doing you know work through cone<br>joint<br>and and all these beautiful tco models<br>tvo models<br>roi calculators to be able to extract<br>the value pool<br>okay i'm better than someone else then<br>i'm going to have a differentiation<br>value which is a total number<br>that's more on the b2b side and then i'm<br>going to share that value with<br>the customer it's less of a calculation<br>in b2c because you know the brand power<br>is so strong<br>in the customer mind that you know the<br>customers are allocating a lot of weight<br>to the perception of the brand<br>and their preference toward the brand<br>and then this is related to brand equity<br>you know so but sometimes you'll see<br>in stores you know a statement of value<br>statement of differentiation on<br>packaging twice as fast<br>28 percent more whitening so these are<br>kind of a<br>nuggets that will justify the perception<br>of value and the consumer will look at<br>brand a and brand b and look and say<br>well i'm gonna<br>i'm gonna make a trade-off between brand<br>and brand b i'm gonna buy brown<br>brand a because i like the brand i like<br>the the benefits they put forward<br>or the positioning in the store etc and<br>and obviously the uh<br>the mine share that the uh the vendors<br>get through advertising<br>and at the end you price so you see<br>value-based pricing is 90<br>value 10 price not the other way around<br>so as a chief value officer i could have<br>been called chief pricing officer but i<br>decided cheap value officer because most<br>of the work we're doing<br>is about establishing that value in the<br>mind of our customers<br>whether they are passengers in planes<br>government buying<br>uh you know defense systems or you know<br>we build satellites<br>and we launch them everything has value<br>and that value again<br>is you know exchanged against price so<br>an example of what comes out of<br>value-based pricing it's called<br>it's called an evee an economic value<br>estimation where you actually<br>show your differentiation value those<br>are called value drivers and you see<br>them<br>quantify 2350 you have a reference value<br>which<br>is you know the price of your competitor<br>or if you buy an iphone it'll be another<br>iphone<br>another a phone there's always going to<br>be so a reference<br>uh you know when you make a selection<br>frame of reference and reference<br>then you're going to add your you know<br>positive differentiators deduct<br>your negative differentiators and that<br>will give you you know<br>value that you can exchange with the<br>customer so this concept of evees<br>you know they could you could also build<br>total cost of ownership models they are<br>well understood in you know in companies<br>that do value strategies<br>and you know and you can actually buy a<br>software uh you know in the cloud to do<br>these uh<br>what i call the staircase models and<br>this is what uh we do in my company a<br>day in day out<br>uh to justify to equip the cell the<br>sales people<br>with uh you know good uh argumentation<br>and good value proposition are<br>quantified<br>so what happened when we are facing this<br>turbulence because i mean at the end of<br>the day we are in an earthquake<br>uh you know and it's not over at least<br>in the us we're not over maybe in new<br>zealand i know you're doing much better<br>but in the u.s we are still in the<br>middle of wave one and we have a<br>bit of a chaotic situation so we have a<br>lot of changes in<br>the business as usual the customer<br>sentiments the level of optimism<br>you know uh whether consumer optimism or<br>business owner optimism<br>the changes and perceptions of value for<br>money everything is<br>is is really changing on the on a daily<br>basis based on what's happening in the<br>news and people right now are very<br>focused on you know<br>what's happening with our you know that<br>virus and and the disruption in business<br>also the ranking and the importance of<br>the value drivers you know<br>you know sometimes you may look at a<br>balance situation i'm going to select a<br>brand or product versus another because<br>i do have rational gains but i do i also<br>have emotional<br>attachment to the brand or abused event<br>i have relationships<br>established with vendors right now a lot<br>of the decision is going to be maybe<br>much more based on rational<br>savings and you know protecting the cash<br>flow and<br>and make sure that we survive for the<br>next six months so<br>you know it impacts the the ranking of<br>the valley drivers<br>in the selection of potential offers but<br>also the willingness to pay<br>so within super right now is all over<br>the map and if you do<br>a primary research to test that through<br>conjoint and other<br>you know trade-off analysis you're going<br>to find big changes and you're going to<br>find that uh maybe<br>you got to do that more regularly right<br>now to uh to really truly extract<br>something that makes sense but it's also<br>an openness to make further sacrifices<br>you know maybe you used to buy a brand<br>that<br>or you used to select a carrier that was<br>more luxurious<br>right now consumers are trying to be<br>very uh conservative and maybe<br>lower their standards as far as brand<br>and quality<br>and uh and that changes the game and so<br>especially when you're positioning the<br>premium or<br>the differentiated uh strategy area<br>where you're going to have to maybe<br>change your versioning strategy to be<br>able to<br>you know adapt your versions of the the<br>products to uh<br>towards the low end of the the range so<br>emergence of irrational and emotional<br>body drivers we know we see right now in<br>the us were still<br>cannot get uh you know gloves and end<br>masks and uh at some point we have no<br>toilet paper<br>for three months you know the number one<br>economy that have no you know no<br>toilet paper it's a bit of irrational<br>but right now you see patterns that are<br>exploding<br>and it's all over the map and even you<br>know you know<br>we the best data point we had was 2008<br>2009 the last<br>big crisis but this one is a lot more<br>erratic<br>as far as the changes on in consumer<br>behavior the changes in preference<br>and you know what i would call the flock<br>behavior where you know trends and<br>people look at the<br>you know twitter and go and you know buy<br>and what<br>people are saying so what does that mean<br>for value-based managers for marketing<br>managers for<br>sales managers is you know these seven<br>points you have to refresh your customer<br>segmentation<br>your pass segmentation may be obsolete<br>outdated and it's important to look at<br>preferences and customer needs right now<br>and<br>and project a new normal for the next 12<br>to 18 months and what's going to happen<br>and what what has been the shifts in<br>customer needs and preferences<br>you need to monitor your competitive<br>actions uh step number one is available<br>is pricing and looking at<br>what competition is doing lots of<br>movement there right there lots of<br>innovation new business models new<br>services<br>you know competitors are on the attack<br>some low cost for competitors are buying<br>market share for the future<br>so that means right now all the value<br>perception and those are relative<br>are changing that means your value maps<br>your value models<br>everything needs to be refreshed so if<br>you have a product<br>strategy if you have a marketing<br>strategy right now it needs to be<br>totally redone<br>uh and obviously fed with consumer<br>insights<br>that are fresh and you know you cannot<br>take it in 2019 and make a projection<br>for 2020 and 20 to 21.<br>that includes also visiting your<br>versioning strategy packaging strategy<br>launching a lot of new exciting new uh<br>maybe versions of products bundles and<br>that you can use your uh<br>your systems to do this based on you<br>know preferences and what customers have<br>bought for the last three months<br>and immersion needs as well as maybe<br>launching new subscription models and<br>usage-based models when companies are<br>struggling with cash<br>uh all that needs to be then put in<br>in the playbook for the salesforce i<br>mean no doubt the salesforce right now<br>is under attack they're under stress<br>they have to learn not only to sell<br>virtually but they have to<br>be equipped with new and refreshed value<br>tools<br>so you see right now you know doing cost<br>plus<br>in the crisis is very complicated<br>because your costs are very erratic as<br>well a lot of costs are going down that<br>means your price should be going down<br>but value-based pricing in a crisis is<br>also you know very dynamic<br>so you have to embrace agile pricing you<br>have to change refresh your<br>your tools and your and your outcome of<br>all the analysis uh every month<br>and and obviously uh be very in the<br>forefront<br>of what's happening in your in your<br>market<br>uh through customer research and adapt<br>adapted<br>that so being a child so not an easy<br>process but it has to be done<br>um i'm going to stop here this is my<br>information you can contact me on<br>linkedin and<br>follow me on on linkedin and twitter and<br>i appreciate the opportunity to speak<br>today<br>thank you stefan very insightful and<br>we'll come back to many of the concepts<br>that you've raised there in the terms of<br>in terms of value and we'll discuss them<br>within the context of the two speakers<br>the next speaker to many does not need<br>an introduction<br>and professor cheryl kaines was a<br>professor<br>professor of operations management at<br>the<br>cornell hotel school and i remember many<br>reading many perpetrators<br>whilst i was whilst i was a student<br>studying hospitality management without<br>doubt uh<br>sherry is world renowned and one of the<br>leading thinkers and academics<br>within this field so without any further<br>ado uh sherry<br>welcome to new zealand well thank you<br>and uh good morning from singapore<br>um i'm very very happy to uh to be with<br>all of you and thanks thanks for<br>inviting me and<br>i think i first met ian and um we were<br>in scotland<br>back in scotland up in dunblane where i<br>was introduced to having whiskey for<br>breakfast<br>i did not have any of it and and what<br>i'm going to be<br>talking about this morning or this<br>afternoon<br>is kind of the new world of capacity<br>constrained demand<br>and what got me really going on this was<br>a month or two ago<br>i was having yet another zoom happy hour<br>with some friends and<br>one of my friends and former students<br>and we said why do you even need revenue<br>management when there's no demand<br>and i kind of got annoyed by that being<br>a revenue management person and i<br>started thinking about it<br>and you see all these things that are<br>out now i mean new zealand no open<br>borders for a while<br>uae with safety rules singapore the<br>casinos are open but at 25<br>capacity you know people afraid to<br>travel all these sorts of things<br>what does revenue management actually<br>look like and<br>there was a great article by dan<br>schoodle one of my former students i'm<br>proud to say i'm talking about effective<br>capacity but given your constraints<br>what's your effective capacity we're<br>used to dealing<br>with fixed capacity in revenue<br>management and stefan kind of pointed<br>out<br>everything's kind of in flux right now<br>and so it's not exactly the same as what<br>it was<br>and essentially we're going from a giant<br>box to a smaller box<br>now in new zealand your policy risk<br>constraints have gone away for the most<br>part<br>but there's still constraints that<br>you're dealing with and this kind of<br>brought me back to one of my favorite<br>all-time books<br>it's the only book in my life that<br>students have actually thanked me<br>for making them read i mean it was kind<br>of a little odd<br>called the goal and i would highly<br>recommend it's a novel<br>it's about a guy who runs a factory but<br>the theory of constraints<br>just really gets me thinking a lot with<br>revenue management there's kind of a<br>five-step process so<br>identifying the constraints and we'll go<br>through and talk about each of these<br>and so the first one is identifying the<br>constraints<br>so what's keeping you from generating<br>more<br>money or more more throughput and in the<br>in the book they refer to this as the<br>herbie there's a kid who's kind of<br>slowing down the boy scout hike so<br>what's the constraint and there's all<br>sorts of different types of constraints<br>there's physical constraints and<br>policy constraints let me just go<br>through and talk about each of them so<br>physical constraints this is what we're<br>used to<br>in revenue management i have so many<br>rooms i have so many seats and tables<br>i have so many uh treatment rooms all of<br>these<br>i have so many seats on my plane the<br>physical constraints that's what we've<br>always managed<br>but now things are a little bit<br>different and so<br>policy constraints in new zealand i mean<br>you're through these but i mean many<br>other parts of the world the maximum<br>number of people like here in<br>singapore's maximum 50<br>social distancing depending again what<br>part of the world you're in that's going<br>to be different<br>your maximum utilization how much time<br>between guests in dubai now they have to<br>have<br>at least 24 hours between uh park people<br>staying in a hotel room<br>all these different sorts of things that<br>shrinks down<br>your capacity but you have to still have<br>to manage that as effectively as you can<br>demand constraints closed borders that's<br>something going on in new zealand right<br>now when you don't have any<br>international travel coming in<br>same thing in singapore it's kind of a<br>big problem when there's not not any<br>singapore there's no domestic tourism<br>not much people are afraid to travel the<br>climate is it too hot is it too cold<br>season<br>school in session school not in session<br>when do people travel<br>labor constraints in some countries<br>they've had to lay off labor<br>or people have gone back to their home<br>country there's not enough labor to open<br>up that's a constraint<br>and then it kind of goes back to what's<br>your effective capacity<br>given your constraints what do you have<br>to work with as revenue managers<br>what we need to be thinking about is<br>what is our effective capacity and how<br>do we work with the constraints that we<br>have<br>do we like our constraints no we don't<br>like them but that's what things are the<br>policy constraints often come from<br>governmental policy<br>and so if we go back to step two which<br>is exploiting the constraint<br>with this i'm not talking about<br>exploiting exploiting trying to get as<br>much out of<br>my out of my effective capacity as i<br>possibly can<br>and so we can look at things as you know<br>how can we use our operations to do this<br>what about revenue management what about<br>marketing<br>we don't want things sitting around idle<br>we want to be using when we have a<br>demand opportunity<br>we want to be taking full advantage of<br>it and so you know some of the things<br>that you can do<br>kind of like as stefan was talking about<br>is looking at your pricing strategy<br>i mean what are you doing do you need to<br>be offering discounts<br>what's the value that people are getting<br>out of it where are your customers<br>coming from<br>choosing the right customers and maybe<br>developing ancillary revenue streams<br>so what's your pricing strategy going to<br>be<br>do you need to be offering discounts<br>right now if you've got reduced capacity<br>maybe you don't have to be doing this i<br>mean what's the value that you're<br>providing and and the other thing too is<br>like<br>here in singapore i just saw the<br>it's all there is staycations everybody<br>every hotel in the world is going to be<br>offering a discount and<br>it's crazy so i mean once it's great for<br>consumers not so great for hotels<br>what's your pricing strategy going to be<br>choosing the right customers so for a<br>casino<br>that has to operate at reduced capacity<br>how can they make the same amount of<br>money from this<br>from having less pure customers there<br>how do you choose the people who want to<br>come<br>in this is where your loyalty program<br>comes in<br>ancillary revenue streams think of what<br>restaurants did during<br>during various lockdowns where there's<br>no dying in business<br>delivery takeaway retail<br>a lot of a lot of very innovative sorts<br>of things<br>and we can we get to talk to ben about<br>the airline industry about<br>how we could develop some more ancillary<br>revenue and then getting into step three<br>which is subordinating everything else<br>we want to be making sure that there's<br>always<br>inputs and this is one that i think has<br>particularly<br>particular value for you in new zealand<br>right now is developing revenue during<br>your slow periods<br>okay you've got the constraint you have<br>is yes you've got this i mean<br>the quarantine hotels or the stay home<br>noticed hotels<br>and when that goes away and the borders<br>are closed what are you going to be<br>doing to be able to generate revenue<br>there's domestic tourism but what are<br>some of the other things that you can do<br>and these are things that we normally do<br>in revenue management trying to develop<br>demand<br>during slow periods this is a marketing<br>kind of approach<br>and then step four is one that we don't<br>have too much of an issue with right now<br>this is called adding capacity as in<br>spending money<br>to add capacity we don't really have<br>that issue<br>and then it goes back to like most of<br>these sorts of things<br>it goes back to step one and you find<br>your new herbie<br>and go over and do it and do this again<br>and so<br>what's your new herbie going to be you<br>don't know<br>i mean there's going to be some other<br>bottleneck some other constraint<br>that's keeping you from managed from<br>being able to generate additional<br>revenue<br>that's what revenue management is all<br>about how do you take your constrained<br>demand<br>and use that to most effectively<br>generate revenue<br>and again the theory of constraints if<br>you've not read the book<br>i highly recommend it i'm not on their<br>payroll whatsoever<br>but again when i had students going up<br>to people imploring them please please<br>read this book<br>um that says something to you i mean it<br>really it really was a mind-changing<br>sort of book<br>and to go back to the old winston<br>churchill book uh<br>quote never let a good crisis go to<br>waste we are right in the midst of one<br>right now so use this time<br>to innovate so thank you very much and<br>if you have<br>for any questions or like to get a hold<br>of me here's my email address so thank<br>you<br>thank you sherry that was a wonderful<br>presentation and again<br>um lots of insights there which we'll<br>come back to<br>um at the end of all three speakers<br>could<br>remind participants if you have any<br>questions or any thoughts that you've<br>got going at the moment<br>please use the q and a button um the<br>dialog box<br>and ask a question and we'll we'll<br>answer these questions towards the end<br>of the presentation<br>then the final speaker's part of this<br>trilogy<br>um is ben vinard and without any further<br>doubt<br>to me ben is one of the thought leaders<br>in industry<br>and ben is one of the people that have<br>taken<br>revenue management and pricing and has<br>bridged academia<br>and and practice and he's a<br>very big contributor towards the journal<br>of<br>revenue and pricing manager ben is the<br>senior vice president and chief<br>scientist<br>at serbia with a focus on innovation and<br>leads their thought leadership program<br>so without any further ado then welcome<br>uh ian thank you um and let me go ahead<br>and share the screen<br>can you see my screen now no<br>i just didn't share the screen one<br>second<br>there we are we can see it now okay let<br>me just maximize it<br>yeah give me a second yeah okay<br>uh so thank you ian thank you for the<br>opportunity to talk to you<br>and the and the team at uh at the<br>university on<br>what airlines can do in a covet 19 world<br>so<br>as part of this presentation i'm going<br>to skip over in the interest of time<br>to leave some time for questions i'm<br>going to skip over the first two slides<br>of goals with go through them fairly<br>quickly everyone knows the impact on the<br>airline industry<br>as a result of covet 19. the impact is<br>something i have never experienced over<br>30 years in travel i know that 2008 when<br>we had the financial crisis was bad<br>but that was nothing compared to the<br>financial crisis of 2008<br>or the terrorist attacks for 2001. if<br>you look at the large-scale capacity<br>reductions you're seeing across all the<br>major u.s airlines<br>the impact has been very significant so<br>my key takeaways<br>is so how do airlines operate in a covet<br>19 world<br>either the current covet 19 world or<br>even in a post covet 19 world<br>so there are basically two ideas in this<br>presentation<br>the first idea is on cash flow probably<br>the single most important thing for any<br>airliner is how do you generate cash<br>flow<br>so you can maintain your current so so<br>that you can sustain your operations<br>the second one is more of a revenue<br>management idea<br>in terms of how do you actually do<br>revenue management<br>when you can no longer forecast demand<br>because<br>forecasting demand is a very critical<br>component for revenue management<br>because if you can forecast demand<br>accurately it essentially means that it<br>can be very aggressive in terms of how<br>you set your inventory controls<br>so the variation in demand has a big<br>impact on<br>inventory controls and when you're in a<br>position to not forecast demand<br>how do you actually do revenue<br>management so these are the two concepts<br>i want to introduce<br>as part of this uh presentation so this<br>kind of gives you<br>this is just a recap slide that kind of<br>gives you an idea in terms of top 20<br>destinations as seen on the saber system<br>on the saber travel network system when<br>you look at april 2019<br>versus april 2020 you'll notice that the<br>mix of top destinations that<br>has has changed as a direct<br>result of covet 19 but i think the<br>bigger impact is a volume<br>as you can look at the was you see look<br>at the volumes you see the volumes are<br>shrunk by an order of magnitude<br>new york for example had over 500 000<br>bookings in april<br>and at the same time when you look at<br>new york a year later<br>it's like 15 000. so this is in stock<br>contrast so airlines are in trouble<br>and the fundamental question is what can<br>be done<br>uh to survive so let me first talk about<br>airline cash flow<br>uh this is kind of important for the<br>airlines to sustain operations<br>and the fundamental question i asked<br>myself is<br>is this something that airlines can do<br>by working with corporations<br>for mutual benefit so that is what the<br>next two slides are going to talk about<br>so one of the big most important assets<br>an airline has is seat inventory<br>and for those of you who work in the<br>airline industry<br>you should know that all airlines they<br>negotiate what is known as corporate<br>contracts with corporations<br>so if you're a microsoft or a dell or a<br>ge or any other logical in any other<br>corporation<br>you actually negotiate a contract and<br>essentially what a contract is<br>is actually a negotiated discount off<br>the selling fare<br>so the selling fare is 500 you get a<br>certain discount of the selling fare<br>and the actual discount is applicable to<br>multiple booking classes in the<br>hierarchy<br>most airlines have approximately 24<br>booking classes<br>in a tiered hierarchy from the highest<br>fare to the lowest fare<br>and typically what happens is that these<br>fares are typically applicable for the<br>top 10 or 12<br>booking classes ideally so the question<br>is<br>how can airlines leverage their current<br>corporate contracts<br>so that they can get an infusion of cash<br>flow<br>so we need to look at both the buy side<br>marketplace economics<br>as well as a sell side marketplace<br>economics in terms of how it can help<br>corporations and how it can help<br>the seller which is the airline so<br>the way this typically works today uh is<br>that<br>as i mentioned earlier this is somewhat<br>of a technical slide in terms of how<br>corporate discounts actually work but i<br>think what's important to keep in mind<br>is that<br>as i mentioned there are 24 booking<br>classes and typically the discounts<br>apply to the top ten<br>what airlines need to do is to open up<br>the discounts beyond the top 10<br>and and maybe extend it down to 16<br>booking classes or 18 booking classes<br>the idea being that they can give deeper<br>and deeper discounts<br>and also give an additional discount<br>over the discount they're giving<br>customers today<br>and they can also put a limit on it by<br>saying for this many bookings a month<br>i'll give you this deeper discount and<br>it's applicable not just to the top 10<br>classes but<br>maybe to the top 15 or top 16<br>booking classes in in in return for that<br>what the airlines can expect to get from<br>the corporation<br>is a lump sum payment a pre-negotiated<br>lump sum payment in advance<br>so that automatically improves their<br>cash flow and once that limit is reached<br>in terms of selling up to a certain<br>point what will then happen<br>is that the original discount will come<br>back into play<br>so the deeper discount is limited to<br>what is negotiated<br>it could be 10 000 bookings in the<br>market 5000 bookings in the market<br>but once that limit is reached it goes<br>back to the original<br>contract so this is one mechanism by<br>which<br>uh airline corporations can prepay<br>and get a bulk volume discount in return<br>for that<br>airline has to do some tracking in terms<br>of uh<br>keeping count in terms of all the cop<br>all the discounts that are applicable<br>so once the limit is reached they can go<br>back to the original discount<br>so this is one method by which an<br>airline can get a instant<br>infusion of cash flow and this is<br>something that has been discussed<br>internally between airlines and<br>corporations over the last few months<br>so this is kind of an important strategy<br>that airlines should be looking into<br>the second idea is what i call as<br>continuous demand management<br>the whole idea of continuous demand<br>management is that<br>when you have a situation when the<br>forecast or demand<br>of consumer demand for a product is<br>unknown<br>or it's high it's or it varies widely<br>it's very hard to determine what type of<br>inventory controls you need to be<br>setting<br>what that also means is that traditional<br>revenue management practices<br>that are typically followed in terms of<br>how you forecast demand you set<br>inventory controls<br>and then you monitor those controls over<br>time simply would not work<br>so what is the alternative approach to<br>revenue management and this is kind of<br>what i call<br>as a robust revenue management approach<br>where the only elements you take in<br>common<br>you take the key performance indicators<br>the key metrics of an airline in terms<br>of<br>how they measure performance and then<br>what you do is<br>you create the plan up front and then<br>you start monitoring the plan<br>and the kpis on a regular basis and<br>every time you realize<br>that you're not going to hit your plan<br>you go ahead and take corrective action<br>so this process is what we call as<br>continuous demand management<br>in some ways i actually learned this<br>technique of continuous demand<br>management<br>a few years ago when i was away from<br>sabre and working in the retail industry<br>at a company called i2 where in the<br>retail industry this is something that<br>they<br>do all the time it's also something that<br>they do<br>in computer oems from time to time<br>simply because of the uncertainty in<br>demand and if uncertainty in demand<br>cannot be mastered<br>the best approach is to keep monitoring<br>your key kpis on a regular basis<br>and take corrective action the<br>corrective action you take<br>is with a sequence of levers that i call<br>as demand levers or supply levels<br>so we'll talk about that in a second so<br>this is kind of what we are talking<br>about<br>right so ultimately any airline out<br>there<br>on a quarterly basis they would like to<br>hit a certain earnings per share<br>estimate<br>they have to make the plan happen right<br>regardless whether the forecast is good<br>or whether the forecast is bad so the<br>fundamental question<br>is how do you go about doing it in a<br>consistent fashion so you have a<br>consistent repeatable process<br>by which you can hit your plan<br>regardless of the circumstance you're in<br>and so this is kind of so basically what<br>it comes down to<br>is there's a planning component where<br>you go back and define events<br>and i'll explain that in on the next<br>slide uh key performance indicators<br>define your thresholds and define the<br>frequency of monitoring<br>and then you do the continuous<br>monitoring and then you categorize your<br>alerts<br>you have to do the root cause analysis<br>before you can go ahead and<br>you had to do the root cause analysis<br>before you can go ahead take take the<br>corrective action<br>okay so this slide kind of encapsulates<br>what i'm talking about<br>so let's say for example an airline<br>realizes<br>that their system revenue is below<br>target<br>so there are two ways there are two<br>reasons why that might be the case<br>one is the total sales volume may be<br>below the plan<br>the second case is when the yield the<br>revenue per uh<br>rpm or rpk is below the plan<br>so then systematically what you do is<br>you go back and look at your market<br>entities that you define in pricing<br>and and go back and ask yourself for<br>each of the different market entities a<br>market entity is nothing but a grouping<br>of markets<br>so you basically ask yourself the<br>question is a revenue below plan<br>or above plan and then you dissect it<br>further and then you come back and say<br>you determined that in a certain market<br>entity<br>the inventory by class could be below<br>plan<br>in some cases a point of sale for london<br>or<br>paris could be below plan or sometimes<br>you may realize you may have<br>you may have have had a sales promotion<br>that did not work too well<br>so when you know the root cause the next<br>step is you got to go back and invoke<br>your business labels<br>the business levers that you would<br>typically invoke<br>are demand levers or supply levers<br>there's a big difference between demand<br>levers and supply levers<br>demand levers when you go ahead and<br>invoke them<br>the impact is almost instantaneous like<br>you will feel the impact<br>in the next few days whereas supply<br>levers take more time<br>it typically takes it requires a lead<br>time of three to four weeks<br>before you see the effect of a care of a<br>supply lever<br>so an example of a supply lever is<br>a demand driven dispatch this is what a<br>lot of airlines typically do<br>when you realize that you have a certain<br>capacity on a certain route but the<br>demand does not exist<br>and then you want to switch out the<br>larger plane for the smaller plane<br>so that is a capacity adjustment<br>and this cannot be done instantaneously<br>this requires planning<br>it requires a two week or three week<br>lead time before<br>you can actually effect a change whereas<br>on the other hand<br>it demand labor like shutting off a<br>or introducing a promotional fare for a<br>certain point of sale<br>these are things that can be implemented<br>on very short order<br>and you will see the impact of that<br>almost immediately<br>so this is an alternative way of<br>actually doing revenue management<br>without using all the traditional models<br>like demand forecasting the optimization<br>models<br>instead all you're doing is you you have<br>all the key kpis the key performance<br>indicators that revenue management uses<br>and then you run through a decision tree<br>run through a root cause analysis<br>and then determine what kind of demand<br>labor or supply lever<br>you need to go back and invoke and by<br>invoking the<br>invoking the right levers the intent is<br>you want to make the plan happen and the<br>plan at the end of the day is nothing<br>but the earnings per share estimate<br>if you're a public company so that is<br>what i call our what we call as<br>continuous demand management the process<br>of continuous monitoring<br>and corrective action on a day-to-day<br>basis<br>so that you can actually hit your plan<br>uh<br>so that pretty much wraps up the two<br>ideas so the first one was cash flow<br>and the second one was uh continuous<br>demand management<br>for starting with root cause analysis<br>and business leavers<br>to take the corrective action if anyone<br>has any questions on<br>either topic i do have a paper on each<br>topic<br>this is just a written paper i'll be<br>glad to send it to you<br>okay thank you ben and i think from all<br>three presentations<br>um we've got lots of insights of how<br>revenue management and pricing is<br>changing<br>and some ideas about the point about<br>going forward<br>so we have a couple of questions um<br>on the board and in the terms twice and<br>first of all i've got a very very broad<br>question which i'll put to all three<br>panelists<br>and given that everybody is offering<br>discounts across the world<br>there isn't any sector where there's<br>discount on discount<br>on discount um do you have any specific<br>well i'll start i'll start off um<br>there's nothing wrong with offering<br>discounts and i mean you probably do but<br>the key thing<br>here is you want to make sure there's a<br>couple things one is you want to make<br>sure that it's tightly fenced<br>that you have restrictions associated<br>with it um<br>and then the other part with this is<br>that there's a difference in the hotel<br>industry<br>and been kind of alluded to the student<br>airline industry<br>between your public rate and your<br>private rate and you want these to be<br>more on the private side because you<br>want to<br>if you can not be showing if you're<br>tonight you might actually be able to<br>get a room for 50 a night probably not<br>but that's not going to be out there for<br>everyone it's going to be very<br>very tightly fenced<br>kind of thing and why do i say that this<br>is based on the<br>2009-2010 um downturn<br>advice from from other people<br>experts had gone through this and then<br>also based on you want to be looking at<br>your competitors<br>um you don't want to be priced a whole<br>lot lower than them because the research<br>on that shows that that's not a good<br>and if i can just add to that what to<br>what sherry said<br>if you look at the cash flow model i<br>kind of walked you through i spoke about<br>giving deeper discounts<br>but the fare restrictions are still the<br>same right the fare restrictions don't<br>change<br>so essentially corporate discounts the<br>way that<br>they typically work you have public<br>adult fares with restrictions and the<br>same restrictions<br>will also apply to the corporate fares<br>the only point is<br>you're giving them a slightly higher<br>so i i may make a couple comments i mean<br>in light of what i just displayed as a<br>an exchange between value and price<br>you know when everything collapses then<br>you have two choices you reduce price or<br>you increase value<br>so in some cases discounts are necessary<br>because you you know you may be pricing<br>yourself<br>yourself out of the market based on what<br>you deliver<br>but also uh you may you have companies<br>that decide to give<br>upgrades and and more uh you know value<br>components<br>for free instead of giving a discount<br>like free upgrade extended stay<br>late check out and all these uh you know<br>maybe uh extending a subscription time<br>period<br>or upgrading a subscription instead of<br>touching the discount and the price<br>because if it affects the anchoring<br>uh for the long term so uh you know one<br>or the other at the end of the day uh<br>you have to be agile and you have to uh<br>look at what's happening in the um you<br>know that influences pricing and take<br>um i've got a question that's come in um<br>offline<br>and it's directed towards stefan um<br>considering the process of value and one<br>thing that<br>may have been missing from yours from<br>your slides is<br>what's the connection between core<br>well you know co-creation implies that<br>uh you know you're doing this with<br>uh someone else you know a partner and<br>and inherently when you co-create you<br>have a<br>sharing of that value eventually um so<br>uh unless i misunderstood the question<br>but you know let's say you could<br>you design a product with a customer and<br>you create a lot of value for both<br>and at the end of the day uh you share<br>that value equally during the uh<br>you know the implementation the<br>execution um<br>there is a sense that you know you um<br>you know you've created something<br>together and unless a competitor attacks<br>you<br>uh with a different offering and the<br>customer wants to switch<br>you know uh again you're embedded with<br>the customer because you've<br>co-created it and you've co-executed it<br>um but i would say that uh you know<br>there is always going to be a situation<br>like right now where the customer may<br>say hey you know what<br>we need discounts or we need situation<br>so at the end of the day<br>you have to still adapt your your<br>pricing your or your value proposition<br>but it's still going to be shared and<br>the question is can you remain<br>fair in the sharing and equally uh share<br>that value pool<br>uh even even though you're going to<br>share maybe discounts for a while or<br>or give concessions for a short period<br>of time<br>i don't know if i answer the question<br>but that's fine i'll i'll send a<br>specific question to you by email<br>maybe you can get back to the<br>correspondent um<br>questions to ben and to sherry and going<br>forward<br>how do you think revenue management and<br>yeah i can go first if you'd like um<br>well<br>what are the big changes you're going to<br>see with revenue management is that<br>you're going to see a convergence<br>of revenue management and pricing in<br>many ways airline pricing is<br>hasn't changed a whole lot since airline<br>deregulation in 1979<br>in the sense that most of the pricing<br>activity that you see<br>in the airline community is based on<br>tactical pricing<br>which is united airlines races affair by<br>ten dollars the other airlines decide to<br>match it or not match it<br>what's happening in today's world with<br>dynamic pricing which is kind of a new<br>method<br>for inventory control where the price is<br>a determinant<br>of what the uh of what the inventory<br>control is<br>this is actually the first time that<br>revenue management and pricing are<br>actually coming together<br>where you no longer have static prices<br>but you actually have a dynamic price<br>that is actually created and actually<br>sold to a given customer<br>so this is kind of the future of revenue<br>traditional revenue management which is<br>demand supply match<br>and pricing which is kind of separate in<br>terms of how they come together<br>so the selling fare is a dynamic fare or<br>and i would kind of add to that on the<br>technical side i mean i think hotel<br>revenue management<br>is very much i mean they i mean when you<br>talk to revenue managers say no no no<br>we're really strategic<br>you know most revenue management people<br>in the hotel industry are extremely<br>tactical<br>and i agree on your bringing in you the<br>pricing is becoming a lot more<br>just being tactical isn't that is not<br>going to cut it in in<br>what's going on right now what's going<br>to go on afterwards and i would add to<br>that not only the pricing but marketing<br>i mean marketing and revenue management<br>have been getting closer<br>over the last five to ten years um this<br>makes it even more<br>how do i i need to get some people in<br>during that period<br>is that are those the right people how<br>do i design that campaign so i think<br>you're going to see kind of a<br>convergence but that also means though<br>is that for people who are in revenue<br>management is that<br>um they need to they need to kind of<br>expand their thinking<br>um so they're not just doing the kind of<br>tactical day-to-day kind of stuff that<br>ben that ben<br>um was discussing because that's exactly<br>what's been going on in the hotel<br>industry if i can just add to that<br>over the last year i think there are<br>about 10 airlines in the world<br>that are actually experimenting with<br>dynamic pricing on their websites<br>there are about 10 airlines doing that<br>today the challenge that they have is<br>they need to have make sure that what<br>they're doing on their website also<br>works across other channels of<br>distribution<br>and that's where the challenge is and<br>that's kind of what they are working<br>toward<br>but many of them have actually<br>implemented dynamic pricing<br>on their consumer direct channels<br>already<br>and could you just follow through with<br>that what are some of the challenges<br>that they're facing<br>uh the the biggest challenge is that uh<br>you need to have parity or content<br>so basically if you if you have a<br>mechanism for generating a dynamic price<br>on your website you want to also make<br>sure<br>that when a travel agent does a<br>comparison shop<br>the dynamic prices that the airlines<br>want the agent to see<br>are part of the comparison shopping<br>experience<br>so this introduces a lot of technical<br>difficulties that need to be worked<br>through<br>and messaging standards that need to be<br>applied uh for the<br>for this to work in the other channels<br>thank you thank you um i've got a<br>question here<br>and if i hotel's been closed for four<br>months<br>um what's<br>sorry i've got a question here if my<br>hotel is being closed for four months<br>and it reopens what's its value<br>proposition when it reopens in terms of<br>revenue management and pricing how do<br>they<br>how do they bring it back how do they<br>bring that together<br>that was a question to stefan whoa<br>i defer to the expert because i i'm not<br>i'm not an expert in hospitality so i<br>don't want to make a photo of myself<br>well i mean number one you've got to do<br>is i mean you got everybody else<br>in the world who's in the same situation<br>and so you've got to be<br>i mean and so the the very the real risk<br>of<br>a um price war is there um because your<br>competitors are all going through the<br>same thing<br>i mean rule number one is make sure<br>you're executing well<br>um and then what i mean by that is you<br>know all the all<br>you all the every hotel chain in the<br>world is saying they've got<br>clean this and save that but if you see<br>some of the news media stories on that<br>that's not so<br>true um so make sure that you're<br>executing that well<br>make sure that you're really<br>understanding what it is that your<br>customers want and that sounds like a<br>minor thing<br>um but this is something where design<br>thinking can come in<br>and and and i hope that during this time<br>that you've been closed that you've been<br>engaged with help you with connecting uh<br>with your with your clientele whether it<br>be your meeting planners or your<br>customers<br>but you know and again the research i've<br>done over the last few months people<br>talked about that<br>kind of maintaining a sense of community<br>is something that's really i mean it's<br>something that's been really very<br>beneficial<br>and so i mean if you haven't been doing<br>that do it<br>um you know we're opening we're so happy<br>to have you back<br>i mean you're just kind of creating that<br>that sense of community<br>and at the same time making sure from an<br>operational standpoint<br>that there are no glitches i mean the<br>last thing in the world you want to have<br>happen is<br>oh i went to that hotel and this was the<br>first infection<br>anything anything going wrong right now<br>is going to be a lot worse situation<br>than it would have normally been<br>if i if i can just add to that uh sherry<br>and<br>ian i also think that mothballing a<br>property for two months is a<br>it's a wrong strategy uh let me give an<br>example last week i was in new york<br>and i had to and i had made a booking at<br>a marriott property at the spring hill<br>suites i think<br>and they had a very interesting model<br>this is something that marriott claimed<br>to have invented<br>they basically told me that when i<br>checked out of the property<br>for two whole days no one would visit<br>that that room<br>and the third day they send some someone<br>in to clean the room up<br>and make it available for the next guest<br>which essentially means from a capacity<br>perspective they're taking a big<br>hit on capacity uh by not selling all<br>their available rooms<br>but this is how they are sustaining<br>their operations and generating<br>some level of cash flow at the property<br>and this is something that<br>uh the the i spoke to the general<br>manager<br>and he told me that this was a marriott<br>first or a marriott idea<br>that they are implementing across all<br>the hotels<br>in the mario chain to kind of add to<br>that in some<br>in some countries in some areas i mean<br>the hotels are forced to close i mean<br>they don't have any choice in the matter<br>so i mean and in that situation um<br>you know you're kind of you're you're<br>kind of in a in a bit of a<br>bit of a bind to put it minor to put it<br>mildly<br>question for sherry um considering<br>the framework that you put forward in<br>terms of theory of constraints<br>and from a revenue management<br>perspective<br>what's the difference the difference<br>between management at<br>the management of of it from a strategic<br>perspective and from from an operations<br>perspective<br>so from a group of hotels against a unit<br>itself<br>um well i think you know with i mean so<br>let me just make sure i understand the<br>question correctly about<br>doing it across the group of hotels as<br>opposed to just an individual hotel<br>yeah okay you've got a lot more<br>flexibility<br>i mean and so you're depending where the<br>group of hotels<br>if they're located in the same city or<br>if they're kind of spread out<br>you've got kind of a portfolio of that<br>kind of thing going on<br>where if demand might be a little bit<br>soft and soft in one place<br>you might have it in another place you<br>also have the ability to share capacity<br>depending on where the location is and<br>so for example<br>let's say that you're in a location<br>again this varies by part of the world<br>what the what the restriction the<br>policy restrictions are that are put on<br>by various governments<br>is that let's say that you have a<br>restaurant that is restricted to<br>a certain number of people um or<br>meetings are restricted to a certain<br>number of people you might be able to<br>use the capacity of some of your<br>other sister properties to be able to<br>kind of spread that sort of thing out<br>um and so yeah so basically i think if<br>you've got a group of hotels it gives<br>you more flexibility<br>now of course the challenge with that is<br>if you have a group of hotels<br>then you also run into the problem of<br>maintaining consistency across<br>across those kind of like what ben was<br>saying with marriott i mean how do you<br>maintain the same quality across you<br>know thousands of hotels that becomes<br>challenging it's now just past two<br>o'clock<br>and um i'd like to draw this webinar<br>to a conclusion first of all i'd like to<br>thank and stefan<br>ben and sherry for very insightful<br>contributions and<br>understanding of how revenue management<br>pricing and value is going to change<br>callback 19. i'd like to thank<br>colette and abby for the administration<br>of this webinar<br>um and from a personal perspective i i<br>need to sort out a couple of technology<br>issues<br>and the next webinar by the wellington<br>school of business and government will<br>be on the 14th<br>of august and that will be on<br>responsible tourism in the port corvette<br>19 world<br>just to remind people if those that have<br>registered for this webinar you will<br>receive an<br>email in the next couple of days which<br>will link to this<br>uh webinar or for the recording on<br>youtube<br>and if you have any more questions um we<br>will try and answer them<br>individually online so thank you very<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
