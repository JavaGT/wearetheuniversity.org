Though struggles against ongoing disregard, displacement, dispossession, and disappearance can be heavy and heartbreaking, they can also be, as Simpson notes, quite beautiful in the ways they serve our collective dreams for better, stronger, and healthier futures. It is struggle, for example, and recognition of struggle that often brings peoples together.<br><br>Looking at specific examples of activism in the Pacific, this session reflects on what it means to be in solidarity, and perhaps more importantly, how we might engage in struggle. In doing so, this session reflects on the concept of “embodied activism,” considering not only what solidarity looks like but what it feels like when we lend our minds, bodies, and spirits to the struggle, whether at home or in the wider Pacific. Finally, this session reflects on how we take up the work of struggle in both public and intimate spaces, not just carrying the struggle but being changed by it.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

um hopefully any and<br>all mistakes that will happen this<br>this evening including me forgetting to<br>turn my<br>my mic on um we'll get started<br>so as i mentioned um tonight's session<br>is called solidarity in the struggle<br>embodied activism in the pacific and<br>i'm gonna start with this photo and if<br>you're a student of mine<br>and you've taken a class with me you<br>know that i like to start<br>all of my talks and all of my lectures<br>with<br>some sort of art or or photograph or<br>something to kind of get us<br>thinking about the topic that we're<br>going to<br>we're going to be looking at or the<br>theme that we're going to be looking at<br>and so this particular photo<br>comes from where i'm from i'm from<br>hawaii<br>and this photo was taken at the end of<br>last year at the foot or at the base of<br>my mountain and my mountain's name is<br>mauna kea and if you're in aotearoa and<br>if you're not that familiar with what's<br>happening in hawaii<br>we are currently in a long-standing<br>stand to protect our mountain to protect<br>mauna kea from desecration<br>and destruction um this is a stand that<br>has been<br>ongoing for years and when i went home<br>last year at the end of 2019 i went to<br>this particular place where this photo<br>was taken<br>which is a sanctuary a sanctuary that<br>we've created that he<br>or protectors of the mountain have<br>created for people to come for people to<br>find strength and solidarity in one<br>another and for people<br>to show their support for protecting our<br>mountain<br>um what i love about this particular<br>photo is that when i went to the mauna<br>to the mountain<br>i saw this row of what i like to call<br>freedom flags<br>these are flags that represent<br>different tribal nations or different<br>nations that have either achieved<br>sovereignty or are trying to achieve<br>sovereignty and right in the forefront<br>here we see the morning star flag which<br>is the<br>independence flag for our brothers and<br>sisters in west papua<br>and all the way in the back you see the<br>high hawaii or the hawaiian flag which<br>is the flag that we<br>we raise in hawaii to symbolize our<br>our sovereignty our independence and<br>everything that we really stand for as<br>kanakamali or as<br>as indigenous hawaiian people and so i<br>love this photo and i start off with it<br>because i think it is a<br>beautiful representation of our<br>commitment as people in the pacific<br>to the betterment of our collective<br>futures it is this knowing<br>that my independence and my freedom<br>in hawaii for instance is inextricably<br>tied up with<br>the independence and freedom of all of<br>my pacifica relatives<br>that i cannot be free until my brothers<br>and sisters in west papua are free<br>for example um and so again i start with<br>this photo because<br>i think it just represents<br>struggle like these flags are being<br>flown because they represent the<br>struggle of indigenous peoples in the<br>pacific but they also represent the<br>beauty of solidarity<br>and the strength that can come out of<br>shared recognition of each other's<br>struggle<br>so just to give you a little bit of<br>background about where this<br>talk came from it was really inspired by<br>a woman named leanne simpson who's a<br>nishnabe<br>activist writer scholar overall<br>inspiration<br>and in her book called as we have always<br>done she talks about struggle and so it<br>was after reading her book that i really<br>started to think about struggle as<br>something that is hard and painful<br>but also something that's quite<br>beautiful and as leanne simpson says<br>righteous as well so in the book she<br>talks about the<br>the reality of being an indigenous<br>person and to be born as an<br>as an indigenous person and to act upon<br>and experience yourself as<br>indigenous means you're going to<br>experience struggle<br>why are you going to struggle or why are<br>you going to experience struggle<br>because as she says we continue to<br>struggle as people because we are<br>occupied we're erased we're displaced<br>we're disconnected we struggle because<br>our bodies are still the targets for<br>settler colonial<br>violence um rimpac the rim of the<br>pacific maritime war exercises that<br>happen<br>in hawaii every two years and are set to<br>begin in a couple of weeks is one<br>example of that<br>about it's an example of how our how our<br>bodies<br>and our place in hawaii is continually<br>continuously disregarded<br>for the pursuits of colonial nations<br>um we continue to struggle as well<br>because it's our heritage it's our<br>inheritance our ancestors engaged in<br>struggle our kupuna our grandparents<br>engaged in struggle for the worlds that<br>they wanted to create<br>and so we continue to engage in struggle<br>and we are able to engage in struggle<br>because they've shown us how to do so<br>um so in that sense again struggle is<br>hard and it's painful and sometimes it's<br>heartbreaking but it's also something<br>that we know how to do<br>and something we will continue to engage<br>in<br>because as leanne simpson says that is<br>our collective gift<br>to the world it is because we struggle<br>that we will be able to create the<br>futures within which<br>we want to live and within which<br>indigenous people can grow<br>so what's this session about well<br>basically i've decided i'm gonna come<br>and just tell a few stories<br>um that's the way i teach honestly i<br>teach through story<br>i'm going to tell you some personal<br>stories some stories from the pacific<br>and my hope is that these stories will<br>touch upon the themes of struggle<br>of indigeneity and kind of unpack what<br>indigeneity is and what it means in the<br>pacific<br>to also look at the theme of solidarity<br>um to look at the topic of embodied<br>activism and i'll kind of and i'll<br>define all of these things and and<br>continue to unpack them as i move<br>through tonight's<br>um session and then also look at<br>stories about indigenous worlds and<br>indigenous futures<br>um but if i'm being honest and i want to<br>tell you what this session is<br>really about as a teacher um<br>whenever i walk into a classroom i<br>forgot to mention<br>i'm i'm a teacher of pacific studies<br>here at victoria university where this<br>talk is taking place<br>um but whenever i walk into a classroom<br>i am really upfront with my students<br>i tell them of course i was hired to do<br>certain things and the class that i'm<br>teaching you<br>has certain course learning objectives<br>but<br>on top of that i have another agenda<br>and my agenda is all about empowering<br>pacific people<br>and creating a better region for all of<br>us<br>whether you are of pacific descent or<br>not that's my agenda<br>i want to walk into a classroom and<br>empower you to know your place in the<br>region so that you can help me fight for<br>it and fix<br>it um so that's kind of what this<br>session is also<br>all about it's an opportunity and it's<br>an invitation for us to think beyond the<br>walls of whatever classroom you might be<br>sitting in<br>or whatever house you're you're sitting<br>in wherever you may be in the region<br>and to start to consider and be critical<br>of<br>your positionality and all i mean by<br>that is<br>where are you ask yourself that whose<br>land<br>are you on are you on your own land are<br>you on someone else's land<br>and what does your being there mean<br>um this session is also in an invitation<br>to accept the work of solidarity and i<br>use that term<br>work very purposefully and strategically<br>because solidarity is not sympathy<br>solidarity is not just an<br>expression solidarity is an action it's<br>a heavy action it often involves<br>struggle yes it can be beautiful but it<br>is so much more than just<br>words it's work um this is also an<br>invitation to engage in what<br>i like to call embodied activism which<br>is like really just being<br>changed so much by the movement that you<br>are engaged in that you cannot help but<br>live your life<br>differently and it's also an invitation<br>to help<br>carry the weight of struggle by<br>embracing who you are<br>and what you can bring to whatever<br>struggle or whatever movement you are<br>engaged with<br>as an individual activism doesn't look<br>the same for everyone and it doesn't<br>have to<br>so this is an invitation to be<br>self-aware<br>to be self-actualized and to um<br>really be empowered hopefully to bring<br>who you are to the struggles that you<br>care most about<br>i do want to to make clear that this<br>session<br>is less of a lecture and more of an<br>opportunity hopefully to to engage in<br>reflection<br>and it's more of a sharing than it is a<br>how-to like i'm not teaching you how to<br>be an activist or teaching you how to<br>engage in solidarity i'm providing some<br>promptings and some things that i've<br>been thinking about over the last so<br>many years<br>so that hopefully we all myself included<br>can be motivated and inspired to<br>continue on in the work<br>of creating better futures and better<br>worlds for our region<br>for the pacific of course hopefully for<br>the wider world as well<br>so if i'm going to ask people to talk<br>about or to think about their own<br>positionality then i have to be upfront<br>about my own positionality so who am i<br>um i truly believe as a kanakamali woman<br>as a hawaiian woman that who<br>we are is ultimately where and who we<br>come from<br>from the mountain to the ocean<br>generations back<br>so who i am is a hawaiian and hawaii and<br>my experience<br>growing up in hawaii has shaped<br>everything i do<br>everything i stand for and everything<br>that i know<br>so i start with these three photos here<br>because<br>they feature a place that's<br>is at the center of so many of my<br>childhood memories<br>of my memories from adulthood and also<br>so many of my inherited<br>ancestral memories and what i mean by<br>that is that their memories that i may<br>not have experienced<br>myself but i was given and gifted um<br>so these photos come from a place called<br>aniho omalu and what i love about this<br>particular photo the first photo<br>is that you can see the connection<br>between mauna between mountain<br>and kai or ocean and you know in a<br>hawaiian world view<br>we stand for and protect all of it from<br>the tip of the mountain all the way down<br>to the ocean and then into the ocean and<br>everything beyond<br>um the second photo here you can kind of<br>see it's a makaha it's a there's a<br>sluice gate and then there's a channel<br>that goes in<br>from the ocean into a fish pond um and<br>so for me it represents abundance but it<br>represents um<br>uh sustainability as well and then the<br>last photo here<br>is my grandmother um so this is my<br>father's<br>mother um who in all of the stories i've<br>been told about her was a strong staunch<br>small little hawaiian woman who i<br>actually never met<br>um she passed away before i was born and<br>here she is standing on that beach where<br>she took her children where she<br>practically raised her children and<br>she's drying meat<br>in the sun so she has meats you know<br>hung on a line and she's chasing flies<br>away with a coconut<br>branch um and why i bring her in this<br>into this talk<br>is because i didn't meet her as i said<br>in in the physical sense but gosh i<br>visit her in all of my dreams<br>and i go to that beach constantly to<br>visit her to feel closest to her and she<br>is a huge motivation again for<br>everything that i do<br>because she fought for a better world<br>when she was alive and my father<br>continues to<br>and i do now so it's about acting upon<br>and really acknowledging this<br>or this<br>or this genealogy um so that's a little<br>bit about who i<br>am and just to give you a very glaringly<br>obvious kind of example of<br>why i stand to protect places this is<br>what that beach looks like today<br>so here you see that same mountain in<br>the background that's actually hualalai<br>that's a different mountain on the<br>island that i come from<br>um and this is what that beach looks<br>like so it's been manicured right it's<br>been cleaned<br>the sand has been made to appear more<br>white and in the process our own<br>our own brown memories have been erased<br>from it<br>um it's now the backdrop to somebody<br>else's fantasy<br>rather than the beach that my<br>grandmother used to go to to catch<br>fish from the makaha or from the from<br>the fish pond<br>or the beach that she used to go to to<br>teach her children<br>how to be indigenous in their place<br>um and so i bring this here and i bring<br>this in the beginning because i think<br>struggle that i have very very early<br>experiences of displacement<br>of going to a place one day and feeling<br>at home in the very next day<br>seeing a gate and a lock on a gate and<br>suddenly being labeled a trespasser<br>somebody who will be punished if i pass<br>that gate even though<br>on the other side of that gate is where<br>my memories reside where my grandmother<br>still resides<br>in all of my memories of her my<br>inherited memories of her<br>and i don't bring this up because this<br>is a unique experience it's actually<br>such a common experience for so many<br>indigenous people<br>um but that's my positionality and it is<br>that struggle<br>that it very early experience of<br>struggle<br>so why does positionality matter well it<br>encourages us to think about what<br>our being in place means as i said<br>earlier it's<br>an opportunity to ask ourselves<br>questions like how are we positioned in<br>relation to place<br>to people to history and to power if we<br>are not the indigenous person<br>living in the place that we're in how<br>was our being there either facilitated<br>by motivated by or enabled by<br>certain power structures and when we ask<br>ourselves those questions<br>we provide space for engaging in<br>solidarity with the people whose lands<br>that we're on so i mentioned earlier<br>i'm from hawaii but i live here in<br>aotearoa and that means that i<br>as a woman who experiences herself as<br>indigenous<br>have to be critical of my own<br>positionality<br>here on someone else's land and so i<br>bring these two photos in because when i<br>first moved to wellington<br>to te whanganuitara here in aotearoa i<br>had to ask myself the question and this<br>these are never easy questions to ask<br>but i had to ask myself<br>what had to happen in order for me to be<br>here how was my<br>being here how is my being here<br>facilitated by colonialism<br>i live in the middle of a city that was<br>built<br>over extensive waterways i live<br>on top of streams that i can't hear and<br>that i can't see but that literally<br>run underneath the concrete so here i<br>just have two photos one<br>is of a series of wave-like patterns<br>that were painted on a footpath outside<br>of a petrol station a gas station<br>and they mark where a stream runs under<br>water<br>the other photo is the name is the is a<br>photo of the<br>the street that i actually live on so i<br>live on a street called bolcott<br>in in the middle of the of the city<br>and according to my own research because<br>i had to get to know the place i had to<br>know the place<br>intimately in order to understand my own<br>positionality<br>i did research about it and apparently<br>there is a stream that used to run<br>down the curve of that street or where<br>the street now exists<br>and at the end of the street there was<br>this big pool of water called waikoko<br>named for the cocoa where the birds that<br>were said to have gathered at that pool<br>and if you're familiar with wellington<br>city that pool<br>used to sit at the intersections of<br>bolcott manors and willis and what i<br>find so disturbing about all of that is<br>that big building there<br>is now named waikoko so you see this<br>taking of names you see this taking of<br>history and this<br>total erasure of an indigenous history<br>and this replacement with this building<br>and this new story by the way that<br>building is the headquarters of trust<br>power so you've got this huge electronic<br>power um house literally sitting on top<br>of a stream<br>stealing its name so what does all of<br>this teach me<br>as an indigenous woman living in<br>somebody else's homeland<br>i have to be critical of the colonial<br>powers that continue to oppress them and<br>erase<br>them and seek to replace them and i have<br>to use my own positionality and my own<br>privilege<br>to tell those stories to tell those<br>stories that are literally<br>running underneath the concrete<br>now i should know you know what does it<br>mean to be indigenous i've been using<br>that term<br>a lot and the term indigenous has<br>particular<br>functionality in the pacific so in order<br>to kind of unpack that very briefly<br>what does it mean to be indigenous<br>people have all kinds of different<br>interpretations in fact we could do a<br>whole webinar series<br>just on that term alone but i think it's<br>helpful when we look at the pacific<br>region<br>to think about this particular working<br>definition that came out of a united<br>nations<br>study back in the 1980s um<br>so this study was done by jose martinez<br>kobo who was commissioned<br>to do this work to kind of go out and<br>survey and talk to indigenous people<br>around the world<br>to see how they identified themselves<br>and so in this working definition that<br>is often quoted<br>he talks about how indigenous peoples<br>are those that have<br>historical continuity with pre-invasion<br>societies or pre-colonial societies but<br>right now<br>find themselves to be non-dominant<br>sectors of the societies that they live<br>in<br>even though they are determined to<br>persevere to develop to continue to<br>teach their children their<br>their culture to maintain their language<br>they find themselves in this position<br>where they are now the non-dominant part<br>of society he goes on to say and other<br>follow-up reports have gone on to say<br>that indigenous peoples unfortunately<br>are often the minority<br>in their own homeland um<br>and with that positionality with being<br>pushed out of the<br>way with being made to become a minority<br>in your own homeland<br>comes struggle so when we talk about<br>solidarity when we talk about people<br>coming together<br>we've been able to witness across the<br>world but in<br>in the pacific as well that indigenous<br>people continue to come together because<br>of a shared experience<br>and a recognition of struggle it's those<br>struggles that come with displacement<br>that come with<br>ongoing erasure that come with ongoing<br>dispossession<br>and i want to point out that a<br>recognition of struggle doesn't have to<br>flatten diversity or<br>specificity just last week i was<br>in christchurch doing a talk about west<br>papua and i was on a panel and one of my<br>fellow panelists was from west papua<br>and before we got to the forum we were<br>driving around christchurch and he<br>you know i i remember him saying quite<br>clearly he was like<br>hawaii and west papua they're the same<br>and i knew what he meant<br>he meant we're the same in that we are<br>both under prolonged military occupation<br>and making that connection and being<br>able for<br>him to look at me and me to look at him<br>and say i see you<br>and i understand and i'm here doesn't at<br>all<br>erase the specificity of our experiences<br>the fact that i can raise my flag and he<br>cannot<br>the fact that he lives here in aotearoa<br>and is very vocal about<br>the ongoing slow motion genocide in west<br>papua and therefore may not ever be able<br>to go<br>home so it's not to flatten the<br>diversity and it's not to<br>ignore that diversity it's actually to<br>honor it<br>by recognizing the ways that we connect<br>and then embracing and recognizing all<br>the ways that we are different<br>um so all of this is to say that<br>recognition of<br>struggle of a shared experience of<br>struggle<br>creates opportunity for meaningful<br>solidarity<br>um so i wanted to bring in a few<br>examples just a few recent examples of<br>indigenous to indigenous or<br>trans-indigenous solidarity in the<br>pacific<br>and i think last year um<br>you know earlier my first photo and the<br>photo that continues to feature on the<br>side of my slides here<br>is from mauna kea it's from the mountain<br>that we are standing to protect<br>that many of us continue to stand to<br>protect and will continue to protect<br>forever um and right around the time<br>this sanctuary this was established last<br>year<br>at the base of mauna kea just a few days<br>later<br>um eviction notices were featured<br>delivered to those who were stationed at<br>igu mata<br>up in the official area in new zealand<br>and so we saw this beautiful expression<br>of solidarity between<br>people who are at both places who are at<br>mauna kea or<br>who are at igumato and i won't play this<br>video<br>for the sake of time but please i highly<br>recommend go and watch this video<br>this video features a group um up at igu<br>matao<br>who learned one of the chants and songs<br>that we do on the mauna that we do all<br>over hawaii<br>we do it all the time they learned the<br>words they<br>they made it their own and they recorded<br>it and they participated in the mauna<br>kea<br>or the the worldwide jam i think it was<br>called jam for the mona or mauna kea jam<br>and it was in that expression of<br>solidarity it was in that<br>sun enchanted expression saying i see<br>you and i'm here that people on the<br>mauna that people<br>on mauna kea were strengthened you know<br>and there were all of<br>these exchanges i can cite so many<br>examples of people here who<br>created t-shirts who who sold<br>merchandise and then donate<br>donated all of the proceeds i can cite<br>examples of people in hawaii sending<br>their solidarity to people at umata and<br>it was a beautiful exchange<br>and it continues um<br>last year and i'm not showing this photo<br>because i'm in it i'm showing this photo<br>because last year<br>after i went home to the mauna i<br>returned to<br>to aotearoa and i was able to go to<br>iguamato and when i was there<br>delivering a statement of solidarity the<br>amazing leonie pihama and another group<br>of<br>maori from aotearoa were in hawaii and<br>we timed it so that our deliveries would<br>be<br>synced in so that we could deliver<br>statements of solidarity<br>to each other's homelands at the same<br>time um and so you can see again this<br>recognition of struggle but how from<br>that recognition of struggle<br>there is this beautiful solidarity and<br>it's<br>in that beautiful expression of<br>solidarity that i think we<br>see the kinds of worlds we're fighting<br>for<br>right we kind of see what our indigenous<br>futures can look like<br>when we're in control of our lands of<br>our resources<br>of our people's futures um<br>so after i but you know the question<br>still has to be asked<br>after i looked at the working definition<br>of indigeneity<br>what about all the people in the pacific<br>who don't identify as indigenous and i'm<br>not just talking about<br>or palangi or haole i'm not just talking<br>about people who are of not<br>who are not of pacific heritage i'm<br>actually talking about pacific peoples<br>of pacific heritage who don't experience<br>themselves as indigenous<br>there are people in the pacific for<br>example who don't have much<br>use for that term why because they are<br>the majority in their homelands<br>and they don't actually even want to be<br>associated with the term indigenous<br>because of all of the negative<br>connotations that it carries so what<br>about all of these people<br>now i do want to just ask these<br>questions and these are things that i<br>continuously think about for all of the<br>pacific people<br>in the region who are of pacific descent<br>but don't consider themselves to be<br>indigenous<br>we have to consider if we apply that<br>term to everyone<br>as kind of this umbrella term are we<br>then not<br>allowing for the range of ways there is<br>to be<br>and no one's self as specific and even<br>more importantly<br>perhaps if our most powerful and salient<br>solidarities are between those who have<br>struggled in similar ways<br>those who do identify as being<br>indigenous because they have been<br>marginalized and<br>and have become minorities then our<br>then are our connections and<br>disconnections<br>being facilitated by colonialism are<br>hawaiians and maori so close for example<br>because we've struggled the same<br>and if that is the case then what about<br>all of our connections to other places<br>and other peoples in the pacific that<br>haven't struggled in the same way<br>i don't necessarily have quick and fast<br>answers for these questions but these<br>are things that i think about a lot<br>because in expressing my solidarity with<br>people in the pacific<br>i have to be up front and critical of<br>myself<br>and acknowledge that i've probably<br>excluded and<br>and included certain people just based<br>on the similarity of their struggle<br>to my struggle um<br>so yeah these are big just big questions<br>i think we have to<br>unpack when we think about solidarity<br>across the region<br>um so for me i think<br>if we are not if we don't consider<br>ourselves to be indigenous<br>but we live in a place where there are<br>people who do consider<br>themselves to be indigenous then we have<br>to recognize<br>why indigeneity functions and why it<br>matters and why<br>it has to matter it matters here in<br>aotearoa for example<br>so this is for all of the pacifica<br>people perhaps who didn't grow up<br>thinking of themselves as indigenous but<br>who do live in aotearoa<br>we have a responsibility to recognize<br>how and why<br>indigeneity matters um<br>sorry i see something popping up on my<br>screen um how and why indigeneity<br>matters here in aotearoa<br>indigeneity matters in places like<br>hawaii in places like guahan in places<br>like west papua<br>where the west papuans are quickly<br>becoming a minority in their own<br>homeland because of transmigration<br>policies from indonesia<br>so why does indigeneity function and how<br>can we be<br>part of supporting indigenous rights in<br>the places that we live<br>rather than taking away from them and<br>for me this means<br>going even beyond the distinctions of<br>indigenous or not indigenous<br>pacifica or whatever we want to call<br>ourselves and just building on whakapapa<br>on genealogy it is genealogy<br>that obligates me to the region<br>that that motivates me to recognize your<br>struggle<br>even if it might be a little bit<br>different than my own<br>and again to go back to my earlier<br>statement to know that<br>if i want to be free and independent as<br>an indigenous person or even just as a<br>as a woman in the pacific<br>that that means i have to help every<br>other person in the pacific to also be<br>free and independent<br>whatever that looks like um<br>so i just wanted to note that with mauna<br>we also saw beautiful expressions of<br>solidarity from people who might not<br>consider themselves as indigenous or<br>might not use that term<br>i should say they're not using that<br>western term they know themselves as<br>first people of the places that they<br>come from<br>they know themselves as genealogically<br>connected to the places they come from<br>but they might not use that terminology<br>again because of all of the negative<br>hang-ups that are<br>attached to it so we did see a lot of<br>pacifica solidarity this is just an<br>example from the mauna from mauna kea<br>where we had contingents and<br>representation come from different<br>pacific nations so here you've got samoa<br>american samoa the cook islands aotearoa<br>of course with the tino flag<br>and then we had a huge massive<br>contingent<br>um representing tonga<br>um some other examples of pacifica<br>solidarity here in aotearoa<br>i often look to and find so much<br>inspiration<br>from the work of oceania interrupted<br>oceania interrupted is a pacific and<br>maori<br>women's collective um that is dedicated<br>to<br>performing different artistic actions to<br>interrupt spaces and interrupting spaces<br>is quite essential for for bringing<br>awareness to<br>the struggles in west papua i was really<br>blessed to participate in a few of the<br>actions with oceania interrupted and it<br>and this<br>is just an example of using your body<br>and using your your agency<br>to break into spaces to make people<br>stop and look and wonder and then learn<br>um so that this again is pacifica<br>solidarity that goes beyond those those<br>western<br>terms like indigenous that that builds<br>upon<br>whakapapa or genealogy<br>um we've also have many examples of<br>people standing for our shared<br>inheritance and i use shared inheritance<br>and quotation marks because that comes<br>from<br>the oceanian scholar epeliho of who<br>talked about<br>in his work he talked about how some of<br>the most powerful expressions of<br>sovereignty of<br>sovereignty well yeah sovereignty of<br>radical sovereignty but the most<br>powerful expressions of solidarity<br>also came when people were fighting for<br>our shared inheritance and that is our<br>moana that's our ocean and that's our<br>environment um so you could see that in<br>everything from the nuclear-free and<br>independent pacific<br>from a few decades ago all the way to<br>just last year<br>when we had the major strike for climate<br>change that took place here in<br>wellington<br>and you could see the pacific climate<br>warriors or representation from<br>different pacific nations<br>at the forefront standing for<br>each other you know we might think of<br>the the communities that are being most<br>impacted by climate change as being<br>distant<br>as being out there in the other parts of<br>the region but here you saw<br>young people i was so inspired because<br>you saw young people here<br>standing up for them saying i'm here in<br>aotearoa what can i do<br>to not only stand in solidarity with you<br>but to act and do something and lobby<br>the government and make sure that we can<br>actually witness change<br>to help them um<br>i also just want to point out that<br>even though solidarity can be quite<br>beautiful<br>solidarity and the struggle can be quite<br>beautiful right that doesn't mean that<br>there isn't<br>also struggle in the solidarity um and<br>so i just posed these questions here and<br>i'm going to try to<br>i realize i'm running a little bit low<br>on time so i'll try to<br>be a bit quick here but<br>how do we move beyond hashtag solidarity<br>right how do we move beyond just<br>clicktivism or clicking and liking<br>things how do we move beyond<br>performative activism<br>how do we move beyond what is<br>instagramable<br>into what is embodied i often tell my<br>students some of the hardest solidarity<br>word<br>is not instagramable some of the hardest<br>solidarity work is when you sit down<br>with yourself<br>at home and you become critical and you<br>ask yourself<br>about your actions and you ask yourself<br>about your preconceived notions about<br>your assumptions about your own inherent<br>racism<br>that sometimes or the hardest work<br>happens<br>um and so i think you know when we look<br>at solidarity it's about kind of getting<br>past the movement that becomes popular<br>for the moment<br>and engaging ourselves in that movement<br>for the long haul<br>whether someone's looking and taking a<br>photo or not<br>um and so to get back to leanne simpson<br>you know she just<br>encourages us like we have to be engaged<br>body mind<br>spirit in the movement if you want to be<br>changed by it you have to<br>engage and you have to begin to create<br>a different future and how you begin to<br>create a different future that's you<br>have to live differently in the present<br>if we just go along with the status quo<br>and like and post a few things here and<br>there and i'm calling myself out on this<br>as well<br>then we're not actually going to change<br>the present so we have to engage<br>to be changed and begin to live<br>differently<br>um i also want to point out that<br>solidarity in the struggle means that we<br>must see people as more than their<br>struggles<br>if we only see people in the pacific for<br>example as the struggles that they've<br>gone through and the struggles they<br>continue to experience then we are being<br>too reductive<br>west papua is so much more than genocide<br>yes that is a major issue there right<br>now that<br>needs to be at the forefront of our of<br>our awareness<br>but we also need to know of west papuans<br>is more than that<br>we need to know of them as people with<br>hopes and dreams and talents<br>and ancestral gifts as people who<br>deserve to live just because they<br>deserve to live like everybody else<br>we need to know about the marshall<br>islands as more than nuclear testing to<br>value as<br>more than climate change hawaii as more<br>than being an occupied nation that is a<br>tourist paradise so that has become a<br>tourist paradise of course we need to<br>know those things<br>but we also need to see people as being<br>fully human<br>capable diverse lovable intelligent<br>hopeful worthy etc i could say the same<br>thing for the black lives matter<br>movement<br>we need to know about the the causes of<br>police brutality we need to dismantle<br>structural racism<br>but we also need to celebrate black<br>lives we're being the intelligent<br>intellectuals artists poets<br>you know scholars inventors that have<br>added<br>to our lives so we have to see people as<br>more than the struggles<br>um and that gets me to the topic of<br>embodied activism what do i mean by<br>embodied activism for me<br>embodied activism means that you are so<br>changed by the experience of being<br>active<br>that again you just can't help but live<br>better<br>you just can't help but live differently<br>if you are concerned about climate<br>change for example<br>how can i live differently how can we<br>live differently how can we reduce our<br>plastic waste how can we<br>start buying locally how can we make the<br>small embodied changes in our every<br>single day<br>life that will help us to live in more<br>alignment with the future that we want<br>to create<br>um so we have to be changed by the<br>movement embodied activism<br>is is about changing the way that you<br>live it's about seeing<br>connections as well it's about knowing<br>that you don't have to travel to<br>to a place to to help it or to stand in<br>solidarity and in fact<br>sometimes you can do more in the place<br>that you're in<br>so last year when i when i couldn't go<br>home right away to be<br>at mauna kea i wrote this blog called 30<br>ways to stand for mauna kea when you<br>can't<br>physically stand on mauna kea and i did<br>it because<br>i had to come to chur or i had to<br>deal with the sadness of not being able<br>to go home but then also<br>become really critical with myself and<br>say hey amalani suck it up<br>you can't go home so rather than crying<br>about not being able to go home you need<br>to ask yourself<br>what you can do because you're not at<br>home because there's so much more that<br>you can<br>do we could say the same for west papua<br>we shouldn't travel there we shouldn't<br>go there we should instead think about<br>what our<br>you know certain privileges in the<br>countries that we're in allow us to do<br>for them<br>so distance never ever um<br>never ever means that we don't have<br>obligations distance does not allow us<br>to be lazy<br>distance actually obligates us to act<br>and stand<br>even stronger so<br>coming towards the end of my of my talk<br>here this is an invitation to to know<br>who you are<br>and know what you can do i often have<br>students ask you know they say i don't<br>want to stand<br>in front of a march i don't want to hold<br>a microphone i don't want to do a speech<br>that's fine there are so many different<br>ways that you can be active there are so<br>many different ways<br>that you can show your solidarity it<br>means bringing<br>you and all of your gifts<br>and all of your insights to the movement<br>understanding your positionality in<br>relation to that movement of course<br>but bringing who you are we need the<br>people who are standing on the front<br>lines just as much as we need the people<br>who are doing the speeches just as much<br>as we need the people<br>who are going to rub the shoulders of<br>those who were standing in the front<br>lines just as much as we need the people<br>who are going to cook the food<br>the people who are going to make the<br>infographics the people who are going to<br>film and document and make sure we have<br>a record of all of this movement for the<br>future we need<br>everyone so be self-aware<br>and be self-actualized and know<br>that you have something to bring um and<br>finally<br>continue to engage in the practice of<br>dreaming and creating better futures<br>um oftentimes i think we get so caught<br>up in the movements or in the struggle<br>of the things that we're standing<br>against<br>that we sometimes forget what we're<br>standing for<br>and i mean down to the tiniest detail i<br>know i'm standing for justice i know i'm<br>standing for freedom i know i'm standing<br>for sovereignty but down to the tiniest<br>detail<br>what kind of world do i want to live in<br>what do i want to wake up to in the<br>morning what do i want to wake me up in<br>the morning<br>what do i want the land to look like<br>what do i want to be fed and nourished<br>by<br>and so i bring in a few poems here or a<br>few examples<br>of indigenous futures a couple of weeks<br>ago i was<br>honored to hold a poetry workshop with a<br>group of wahine<br>who each wrote down some of their their<br>freedom dreams their dreams for<br>free independent decolonized<br>demilitarized futures and it is it's<br>these dreams<br>that sustain us and that motivate us and<br>that continue to give us something to<br>hope<br>and work for in the present um<br>i just also wanted to end with another<br>example of beautiful solidarity and<br>dreaming<br>um this is a poem that was put together<br>um a few weeks ago<br>um shout out to the amazing mikey inouye<br>who helped to put this together but this<br>poem um features indigenous poets from<br>across the region<br>and one indigenous poet from turtle<br>island calling for not only the<br>cancellation of rimpac<br>and a huge aloha to all of my council<br>room fat coalition<br>hoa um but this is not just calling for<br>the cancellation of war games this is<br>calling for a better future<br>and so again it's just another example<br>that builds on a long up or a long<br>genealogy of resistance and solidarity<br>in the region<br>and this is just one of the latest ones<br>i think so to sum up<br>before i answer some questions i really<br>hope that this session provided you with<br>opportunities to reflect on your<br>positionality<br>to accept the work of solidarity to<br>consider embodied activism and what that<br>might look like for you<br>and to also embrace your potential as i<br>said this is not a how to this is not me<br>trying to pretend that i'm any kind of<br>authority this is just<br>me speaking as an indigenous woman<br>um who has experienced struggle who's<br>engaged in struggle and who continuously<br>hopes for better futures because i<br>believe that's my genealogical<br>responsibility<br>to the region and to all of you um<br>so yeah i think i will i'll end there<br>um and i'll i'll try to answer some<br>questions so i'll go to the q<br>a um again if you want to um<br>raise your hand and ask a question you<br>can do so and i'll try to<br>figure out how to<br>how to answer it or how to see that<br>you're raising your hand<br>um all right i've got one question here<br>as pacific in new zealand how can we<br>address those who we feel like they need<br>to<br>put a stake in the ground to make their<br>pacific presence felt in this land<br>without acknowledging the oppression<br>that still exists on our maori cousins<br>that's an excellent question i think for<br>me<br>personally as a pacifica person in new<br>zealand<br>i think i i have to use<br>my positionality as someone who is not<br>maori<br>to also speak to those who are not maori<br>to remind them of the importance of<br>indigeneity and again<br>why indigenous rights have to matter<br>in a s in a place that has suffered the<br>consequences and continues to<br>suffer the consequences and legacies of<br>colonialism i find it really difficult<br>when people claim indigeneity to the<br>region as a means of claiming<br>indigeneity to a specific<br>place and i've heard that said and i've<br>heard that kind of claim happen<br>more than a handful of times where<br>somebody who is a pacifica descent says<br>no i have a right to be here because i'm<br>i'm<br>you know indigenous to the region and<br>yes we might be i do consider myself<br>a descendant of the first peoples of the<br>region but that does not give me any<br>claim to space here<br>not in a place where indigenous people<br>are still trying to find their place<br>are still fighting for their place um so<br>as pacifica i think we just have to be<br>open<br>and willing to speak honestly with other<br>pacifica people especially those who are<br>trying to literally like<br>stick a stick a stake in the ground and<br>claim space<br>it's not our space to claim um and we<br>have to make sure and constantly ask<br>ourselves<br>if i do want to claim a space what does<br>that mean for the indigenous people the<br>indigenous people<br>have to be forefront always otherwise<br>we are part of the problem um<br>so yeah i i think that that that's an<br>excellent question<br>um and it just calls on us to use our<br>positionality<br>to help tangata femura for example here<br>in aotearoa<br>um mahalo for that question um<br>i'll go to the chat now that was the<br>only question in the um<br>in the q a there might be some questions<br>about here<br>it looks like oh<br>sorry i'm so sorry about the mute about<br>not turning my mic on earlier<br>um<br>it looks like that's the only question<br>if anyone else has any questions please<br>let me know um<br>i'm happy to answer them yeah<br>you know to be honest the question that<br>question about positionality and<br>um our role as pacifica people in new<br>zealand i have to be honest and say<br>that i probably wouldn't have even<br>thought about that if i never moved here<br>um in hawaii i am the indigenous person<br>right that's my homeland that's where<br>i'm from<br>coming here though it sounds simple<br>has forced me to be has forced me to ask<br>that question okay what does it mean to<br>be indigenous online you're not<br>indigenous too<br>and it sounds like a simple question but<br>gosh that requires a lot<br>of introspection and reflection and<br>a willingness to be honest with myself<br>um yeah<br>i have something here from peace<br>movement aotearoa if no more questions<br>you could talk more about your hopes and<br>vision for the future<br>ah that's thank you thank you for that<br>opportunity<br>um i will admit i don't often allow<br>myself to<br>to go there sometimes to think down to<br>the tiniest detail but<br>my hope for the future and the future<br>that i envision for my children for my<br>grandchildren you know if i ever have<br>them is that<br>we're able to grow and and raise the<br>next generations on<br>lands that are clean with water that is<br>clean<br>on land that we have access to that we<br>can plant<br>and farm as we want to that we don't<br>have to ask permission for those things<br>i dream of a land i dream of a future<br>where<br>west papua is free where<br>the military buildup is no longer<br>happening in places like guahan<br>where indigenous people again have<br>control of the way they breathe<br>and how they breathe and the air they<br>breathe<br>where islanders aren't scared of the<br>ocean rising and taking away their<br>homelands but are<br>once again embracing the ocean that's in<br>them as part of their inheritance<br>um yeah so that's just a little bit of<br>what<br>of what i dream of healthy sovereign<br>futures full of<br>breath<br>yeah i've got another question here<br>um do you believe that mental illness<br>has had an effect on those that are<br>indigenous<br>i believe those who are indigenous do do<br>suffer with<br>mental illness if that's what you're<br>if that's what you're asking and i think<br>it's because of the struggle<br>um it's not easy being indigenous<br>and for those of us who identify and act<br>upon that indigeneity every day we know<br>that<br>we know how taxing it can be to engage<br>and struggle<br>especially if you choose to be active um<br>we know that it can put a strain on<br>relationships that it can impact you<br>personally<br>so yes i i would say that um<br>indigeneity for as as beautiful as it<br>can be<br>because it's so hard and can be painful<br>does and can impact your your mental<br>health<br>um and i speak from personal experience<br>on that one um<br>i would love to hear you speak more a<br>bit more about your involvement in<br>oceania interrupted<br>and the balance between physical and<br>rhetorical forms of embodied activism<br>thank you for that question and oceania<br>interrupted<br>i i engaged in a few actions i think it<br>was back in 2016 and that was an<br>entirely new experience for me um i'm a<br>very wordy person<br>i like words and oceania interrupted the<br>actions that i<br>engaged with my my face was my mouth was<br>covered<br>i had to be silent i had to tie my hands<br>behind my back and<br>walk through public spaces being silent<br>but being a physical presence and that<br>was really<br>um different for me<br>and challenging in in a kind of<br>beautiful way<br>challenging in that it made me realize<br>what it is to walk into a space and not<br>be able to talk<br>and not be able to be heard and what are<br>the challenges that come with that<br>it also forced me to get outside of my<br>comfort zone to walk<br>through for example the the huge<br>pacifica festival that was happening<br>here in wellington and interrupt a space<br>not for myself but for somebody else um<br>so i think that encouraged me to see<br>that how activism and engaging in<br>activism is not actually about us<br>and it's fact it's in fact when we get<br>in the way<br>of the movement or when we get in the<br>way and when we fill ourselves with<br>doubt and fear<br>that we keep ourselves from being<br>everything that we need to be for the<br>movement so oceania interrupted was a<br>profound experience for me<br>for that reason get out of your own way<br>amalani<br>because the world needs more of you uh<br>so that was what i learned there<br>um as a pacific of wahine coming to<br>aotearoa what are some of the challenges<br>you<br>faced in terms of your indigeneity on<br>another land<br>um yeah i think kind of just just<br>thinking about some of the things that i<br>said earlier being a pacifico woman here<br>um first of all there are not many<br>hawaiians<br>so one challenge is that i didn't have a<br>big hawaiian community with which to<br>kind of live with<br>and and find my own hawaiian solidarity<br>with<br>um thankfully i found myself part of a<br>much larger pacifica<br>now which is gorgeous which i absolutely<br>love that people have just kind of taken<br>me in because i didn't have that that<br>hawaiian<br>um base here in aotearoa but some of the<br>challenges again<br>it it to get back to the challenges it<br>living here continuously encourages me<br>or requires that i align myself with the<br>indigenous people<br>if i'm not indigenous but i recognize<br>some of their struggles<br>then i can't be part of the problem and<br>what does that mean then<br>that means then that if somebody asks me<br>to help them<br>carry the burden of a movement then i'm<br>gonna do so<br>in the ways that i can you know like if<br>somebody asks me to speak<br>on a controversial topic like cook's<br>landing<br>and cook's invasion of aotearoa in 1769<br>then i'm gonna talk about it<br>sometimes because my positionality as<br>not maori might mean somebody might<br>listen to me<br>because they're used to hearing it from<br>mali it's the same as if i were home in<br>hawaii preaching about protecting mauna<br>kea<br>if somebody came from aotearoa and also<br>talked about<br>protecting mauna kea people are bound to<br>listen because they expect to hear it<br>from hawaiians right<br>so i i think that that's my role here<br>that's one of the things that i've i've<br>taken on as my role is that when i'm<br>asked to be part of a movement that is<br>for the betterment of maori<br>for the betterment of tangata nua that's<br>what i have to do<br>um and so i don't know if that answers<br>your question that's not necessarily a<br>challenge i guess challenge the<br>challenge was me trying to find my place<br>which i'm continuously trying to do<br>um and always being i've actually found<br>comfort in being a little bit<br>uncomfortable all the time<br>it's like i don't want to feel too<br>settled here<br>so i keep myself slightly on edge<br>always being very upfront about my<br>positionality so that i can help<br>but that's something that i'm i'm still<br>learning so<br>um yeah those are all the q a questions<br>um<br>uh oh i've got a question about healing<br>yeah in response<br>maybe this will be the last one that<br>i'll i'll um i'll answer and then i<br>i've realized we've run out of time but<br>i think this is a good question it says<br>in response to the question about mental<br>health what is healing<br>um<br>returning to place whether it's in<br>memory and returning to people<br>and returning to whakapapa and<br>remembering who we come from<br>and where we come from and why we are<br>in the world i find healing<br>when i take time to breathe when i take<br>time to<br>chant i say chanting because if you know<br>me well you know i can't sing<br>but i love chants and i love language<br>and i love dancing<br>i find healing when i dance when i<br>engage in hula<br>when i dance the stories of my ancestors<br>and remember the worlds that they<br>that they gave motion and sound to<br>um i find find healing when i draw on<br>the strength of my genealogy<br>and that extends into the pacific i find<br>healing in other people<br>and i hope that i can be healing for<br>other people as well<br>and i'll end on this note i started with<br>a photo that was at the sanctuary<br>at a pu'uhonua that we established at<br>the base of the mountain and i remember<br>when i was standing there last
