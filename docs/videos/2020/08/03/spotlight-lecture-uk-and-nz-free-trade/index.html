accurate.</p><p>good afternoon everybody<br>and welcome to the spotlight series<br>we're talking about the new zealand's uk<br>fta free trade agreement why is new<br>zealand interested in this<br>well in a difficult world with a lot of<br>trade tension<br>very limited negotiating powers problems<br>around the united states<br>and china all sorts of other issues<br>around covert<br>there's all sorts of reasons why we<br>should be interested in such a free<br>trade agreement<br>in some ways this is a rather unusual<br>one because quite<br>frequently free trade agreements are<br>between two countries that have done<br>some trade together but are<br>only now getting involved in quite<br>detailed integration of their economies<br>and this one's different there's a bit<br>of history here so<br>in terms of foreign countries new<br>zealand's had a longer<br>trading relationship with britain than<br>anywhere else arguably<br>from australia by a long long way and of<br>course there's some very specific<br>history in all of this as well<br>which is new zealand's economy on the<br>sheep's back<br>through world war ii through the korean<br>war<br>until all prices started to fall and in<br>the early 1970s<br>britain started to negotiate to go into<br>the european economic community<br>and for those of you who can remember<br>that there was a watershed time for new<br>zealand<br>with a huge amount of concern and worry<br>where new zealand prime ministers went<br>off to britain to negotiate<br>and where in the end we got a sort of a<br>deal which was better than in some<br>respects we might have thought<br>particularly because up until that point<br>most of new zealand's exports went right<br>around the world to britain<br>and most of those were primary product<br>originated<br>processed foods of some sort or another<br>and we ended up<br>with a number of particular quota deals<br>that since then<br>have been notified through the wto and<br>they relate to<br>the old-fashioned new zealand exports of<br>sheep meats<br>beef butter and cheese and more on that<br>in a minute<br>but it's also different in the sense<br>that normally there's a negotiation<br>between two partners<br>and in this one there's a third player<br>in the bed if you like<br>and that's the european union and of<br>course we<br>have been in negotiation with an fta<br>with the european union for a couple of<br>years<br>but that's a different sort of thing<br>because there were 28 countries involved<br>there's now<br>27 because of course the brexit<br>the the way that britain has now moved<br>out of the european union<br>as of the end of last year but is still<br>in a customs union until the end of this<br>year<br>and beyond that we just don't know where<br>that goes<br>that is all very relevant to new<br>zealand's negotiation on the uk<br>fta and i'll tell you particularly why<br>in a moment as well<br>um in a situation like this normally<br>advanced economies getting together<br>don't necessarily<br>see a lot of gains to be had in terms of<br>things like gdp and indeed the modeling<br>economic modelling<br>on new zealand and the uk says that<br>there might be a hundred million<br>dollars or something like that of<br>advantage in there but<br>that in terms of extra trade is not<br>major<br>the amount of trade between the two<br>countries totaling<br>exports and imports is about six million<br>dollars<br>at 76 billion dollars and as such it's<br>significant and could grow but we<br>wouldn't expect it to grow<br>hugely like for example chinese trade<br>has been growing hugely over the last<br>little while<br>but it is a chance to do a<br>new generation type arrangement and that<br>means issues around<br>the environment and ip and labor and<br>indigenous rights<br>and gender and issues like that and i<br>think we'll hear some<br>things about that from susie um it's<br>also a chance<br>to do some significant reforms<br>in your economy and certainly new<br>zealand has used that as a<br>trade negotiations as an excuse to<br>liberalize domestically<br>and there's some signs that britain<br>would like to do the same as well<br>we're looking at this from the point of<br>view of britain uh they're in a very<br>unusual position<br>it's quite hard in recent history to<br>find an example<br>where a country has left an integrated<br>trading<br>arrangement of the sort that the eu is<br>and struck out on its own<br>but there's clearly both economic and<br>political issues around this and boris<br>johnson<br>no doubt has in mind his hero winston<br>churchill<br>as he fights them on the beaches and on<br>the borders and all the rest of it<br>in this but one reason<br>why we're engaged in negotiation from<br>the british side<br>is they would like and need to have<br>trade agreements around the world<br>because<br>without those by the end of this year<br>they're<br>in um they're in a quite disadvantaged<br>trading situation where they will face<br>basic mfn tariffs in many countries that<br>they trade to<br>and they have to be able to show that<br>they can make progress and new zealand<br>is considered quite a sympathetic<br>country for them to make progress<br>against or with they when you look at<br>what their they say their aims are they<br>talk about<br>new zealand in terms of being highest<br>on the ease of doing business scale<br>around the world a country where it is<br>possible to do these deals with<br>but on the other hand where there's not<br>necessarily going to be very big<br>advantages<br>britain is looking for more sales and<br>motor vehicles<br>more sales of other plant and equipment<br>for those of you who had the opportunity<br>to drive morris's or austin's<br>or voxels you won't be holding up too<br>long<br>for that new opportunity again<br>and actually where a lot of british<br>involvement in new zealand is it's not<br>so much in the trade<br>of merchandise goods it's on services<br>britain<br>is the fifth biggest investor in new<br>zealand<br>far bigger than china for example and a<br>lot of that comes down to<br>things like insurance travel and other<br>business services<br>and i think that's where they would<br>but when it comes down to it um<br>they very much like to throw off their<br>constraints from europe<br>the brussels ties the ways that the<br>french have held them back in various<br>other negotiations<br>but when it comes down to it we are<br>their 53rd<br>most important trading partner and<br>that immediately says well high symbolic<br>value for them but<br>probably not a lot of very high economic<br>value in all of that<br>where are we in all of this well they're<br>our sixth<br>and most important trading partner now<br>that's nothing compared to what it used<br>to be<br>and it's nothing compared to china or<br>australia or some of the other important<br>trading relationships but it's<br>nevertheless not<br>not insignificant it's still mainly<br>processed primary products and<br>this is where we get to a difficult<br>situation because<br>a lot of new zealand trade into the eu<br>and into britain now<br>is still governed by the quota rights or<br>variations of the quota rights that we<br>were granted back<br>in the 70s and then notified the wto in<br>the 90s<br>and in particular there's five tariff<br>quota<br>areas on beef on sheep meats meaning<br>lamb<br>on butter on soft cheese and non-hot<br>and new zealanders very concerned that<br>this should not be eroded<br>in terms of these negotiations but of<br>course it's complicated because<br>some of those quota rights are with what<br>they were originally all with britain<br>or almost always britain britain went<br>into the eu they got shared around<br>and now there's a question about how<br>they get divided up<br>theresa may's been on record as saying<br>that brexit will not be<br>allowed to disadvantage new zealand<br>trading into britain<br>however making that a reality is proving<br>quite a difficult issue<br>the eu and britain have jointly got<br>together and made an<br>offer to new zealand and a similar offer<br>although much less important to a number<br>of other<br>partners like australia canada and<br>united states that don't have ftas but<br>you have some quota access<br>and those that offer is we will look at<br>how you have traded<br>over the last three years everted out<br>for the product<br>areas and split it<br>accordingly pro rata between<br>british access and<br>eu access on the face of it that might<br>sound statistically<br>fair but actually it's a problem because<br>over the years<br>particularly on the dairy products side<br>the prices have moved around a lot<br>between britain and eu<br>and so have exports move around a lot<br>between britain and eu<br>and we've had that flexibility to do<br>that we won't have that flexibility in<br>future we will be limited<br>to two reduced fixed amounts and that's<br>potentially<br>disadvantageous to us and that's<br>something that<br>we'll have to look at negotiating as we<br>go through this<br>but it's not all um old primary produce<br>it's also new primary produce that could<br>potentially stand to gain so things like<br>wine which sometimes more than doubles<br>in price as a result of exercise duties<br>getting into britain<br>honey some seafood some fruit<br>we are certainly looking to get a<br>reduction in tariffs<br>and get in terms of getting new zealand<br>product into the market<br>are important in all of this and some of<br>them relate to covert<br>some of them relate to new zealand's<br>value added some of them relate to this<br>very difficult<br>trading intentions that are around<br>internationally at the moment<br>but i'll leave those at the moment thank<br>you<br>so thank you so i've chosen to speak on<br>something<br>quite specific when i suspect dear to<br>all of us<br>where i think that the uk trade<br>agreement<br>could provide a unique forum for<br>discussion so alan bollard mentioned<br>briefly intellectual property there<br>and that is my chosen focus and<br>specifically<br>the importance of a covet 19 vaccine and<br>treatment<br>which is we all know the world is<br>collectively<br>waiting for not only to solve some of<br>our health problems but<br>the economic problems which are<br>intertwined<br>so we know that the vaccines and<br>treatments<br>i'm going to focus on vaccines and i<br>will mention treatment along the way<br>are challenging to invent not least of<br>all for the biochemists among you<br>because of the 28 different protein<br>structures that the virus seems to have<br>which masks its behaviour in different<br>areas<br>but much of the delay once a vaccine is<br>invented are likely to be caused by<br>behavior that trade agreements either<br>support<br>through patents and related regulatory<br>measures for health and safety<br>or alternatively the trade agreements<br>have not yet managed to fully tackle<br>with with global supply chain issues<br>so to cover all of this in detail is<br>going to take a considerable amount of<br>time and i don't have all that time so<br>i'm going to highlight some main points<br>about what i'm going to suggest that we<br>should negotiate<br>with the uk and how it might address<br>some of these issues<br>and in fact that does also affect eu<br>negotiations<br>so to get to exactly what we should<br>negotiate i'm going to give you some<br>background to three points of what<br>exists<br>in trade agreements and we can see this<br>particularly in the eu agreements<br>around technology transfer regulatory<br>data and licensing arrangements so some<br>of you may have never thought all that<br>much about patents except they feature<br>in the news more than ever<br>lately so briefly patents give exclusive<br>rights<br>and effectively prevent com competition<br>for a limited period of time that's at<br>least 20 years or a bit more<br>and they're fundamentally justified on<br>what is called<br>innovation incentives so broadly a<br>patent is a legal device that<br>is there for an innovation incentive<br>so patents actually also require<br>mechanisms in it to for technology<br>transfer<br>now free trade agreements and the<br>existing relationships we have<br>tend to focus on the innovation<br>incentives side of the equation<br>not least because big pharma is<br>extremely good worldwide is saying they<br>need more patients and more regulatory<br>data exclusivity for innovation<br>whatever that means but in fact all our<br>trade agreements focus<br>on the innovation incentives but don't<br>actually focus<br>on how patients enable technology<br>transfer<br>or in reality in the pharmaceutical area<br>often<br>inhibit it one way or another so<br>technology transfer is not a concept<br>missing<br>from our trade agreements it's mentioned<br>for example in the trump's wto agreement<br>but it is neither defined or explicitly<br>spelled out<br>in fact that's true across all free<br>trade agreements one notable exception<br>is that<br>china u.s phase one deal actually starts<br>to try and define technology transfer<br>but not really for this type of purpose<br>and we might come back to that if<br>there's some q a about<br>it trade agreements like what you<br>actually in fact<br>have adopted what has increasingly been<br>shown as a faulty assumption<br>that once pharmaceuticals are created<br>and patented they will be made available<br>the problems of availability and access<br>to medicines are<br>being shined on and sharp relief in the<br>covert situation<br>into me says this is likely to get worse<br>but he is hoping for how it might get<br>better<br>so there's no certainty that once a<br>vaccine or indeed an effective treatment<br>is invented<br>that it will be fairly licensed for<br>global use the world health organization<br>in new zealand has joined the effort to<br>say it should be<br>but there's no certainty that would<br>occur and<br>in addition there are problematic<br>problems around supply actually of<br>ingredients so vaccines and medicines<br>broadly can be biological or chemical<br>particularly in the chemical thing<br>there's<br>issues around ingredients the same is<br>true of biologics but they're very<br>different ingredient and supply chain<br>issues<br>all right now part of the technology<br>transfer problem<br>is this global supply chain so<br>manufacturing capacity for active<br>ingredients in pharmaceuticals has in<br>fact<br>why the eu and the uk as part of it<br>being<br>progressively offshored in the same way<br>we've seen a lot of manufacturing being<br>progressively offshored<br>but we seem to be in a time and this is<br>clearly not just the uk and the eu but<br>that's our focus today<br>where we're entering what we might<br>describe as pharmaceutical nationalism<br>where many countries<br>including the uk are looking at<br>supplying their own country first and<br>indeed<br>ensuring active ingredient supply so<br>making a whole lot of chemicals<br>biologics that previously the<br>ingredients were offshore but putting<br>them into a pharmaceutical<br>was onshore so supply chain issues<br>aren't actually confined to the<br>pharmaceuticals themselves but also<br>exists for things like the supply of<br>silica sand<br>which is vital to making the glass vials<br>that come with vaccines<br>and so if and when of accent is an<br>inventor there's considerable trade<br>difficulties in getting it out<br>to the waiting world now we know that<br>there are several researchers<br>and companies investigating vaccines and<br>treatments<br>and many of you will have seen this in<br>the media but i'm going to focus on the<br>two uk companies<br>and one in particular that the peers or<br>the uk partnerships that appear to be<br>leading this race<br>so many of you i hope have heard that<br>oxford university and astrazeneca<br>claim to be at a very good stage in<br>clinical trials and having a lot of<br>success<br>around their vaccine now this is a<br>public private partnership<br>although in reality it's really a<br>private private partnership<br>and essentially in in patent terms and<br>therefore in trade agreement terms<br>the ownership of the intellectual<br>property is entirely with those entities<br>they've indicated that they will allow<br>some licensing however there's exactly<br>no transparency yet about whether that<br>will be voluntary licensing selective<br>licensing<br>and allowing suggests that it won't at<br>all be compulsory licensing<br>okay imperial college also<br>claims to be developing a vaccine<br>although the economist has actually<br>pitted it as further behind oxford i<br>have no idea how tree this is or<br>otherwise<br>but imperial college have actually said<br>that they will undergo a social contract<br>kind of licensing now briefly what that<br>really means is that they will license<br>anyone who is able to do so and<br>gets funding from anywhere however<br>their terms actually aren't transparent<br>either both of these arrangements<br>considerably<br>rely on the inventors actually patenting<br>and having<br>the property rights to enter into this<br>licensing<br>another thing they have in common is the<br>lack of transparency but this isn't<br>actually<br>entirely surprising because this is<br>actually how the whole<br>pharmaceutical industry works in general<br>they don't generally announce<br>any licensing terms until they're in a<br>position<br>to actually license something now this<br>is only part of the problem<br>but it's pretty significant it also asks<br>what can cause us to question the need<br>for pattern type<br>incentives at all in this kind of<br>pandemic situation<br>where the world is really waiting for<br>the vaccine for the medicine there's a<br>considerable amount of participants<br>other than<br>mine would call this new mover advantage<br>right frequently and pharmaceuticals<br>first mover advantage is useful right<br>you come up with the drum first<br>that's good but you don't actually<br>necessarily always know the size and<br>scale<br>of your market actually the pandemic<br>you've got a pretty good idea<br>it's a first mover advantage has a lot<br>more efficacy<br>actually over a patenting strategy that<br>might be business as usual<br>of course they may go together now<br>when you have that first mover advantage<br>there's a question arising as to whether<br>you control<br>all licensing arrangements or you just<br>have voluntary<br>licensing and how much of your<br>information you share<br>so we've seen commentary about sharing<br>information and patented information and<br>knowledge but of course we've also seen<br>an equal amount of commentary<br>about sharing being the antithesis of<br>innovation incentives and it is in fact<br>the pharmaceutical companies who stated<br>that<br>after the world health organization and<br>countries including new zealand said<br>we want to share and pool information<br>and indeed medicines<br>the pharmaceutical companies not only<br>from the united states immediately said<br>no we don't think so now there are one<br>or two exceptions to that the agreement<br>to paul and the eu<br>and so on however<br>history can actually tell us a little<br>bit about how<br>states behave even because it's not just<br>of course the pharmaceutical companies<br>the states are very reliant on this<br>and there are some case studies done by<br>some of my colleagues in australia<br>around us and the one that i will<br>briefly present to you<br>relates to you remember bird flu and<br>sars one<br>right okay so the main treatment that<br>was developed around that was<br>oscillating<br>you may know it as tamiflu octal tamavir<br>is the generic chemical name<br>tamiflu is the brand name that roche<br>gave it<br>so actually this is there's a lesson in<br>there right who knows it more by tamiflu<br>than his chemical name<br>okay so what does this tell us well in<br>fact<br>some of you might recall that what<br>actually happened around the world was<br>stock piling of tamiflu which ultimately<br>ended up actually being not very<br>this is really a network externality<br>problem<br>and the question was how best to tackle<br>that problem<br>so countries actually had a choice which<br>was the path to self-interest<br>stockpiling<br>or they had a choice to send the supply<br>to the countries<br>most likely to need it because of the<br>highest risk<br>right it's a virus countries with high<br>risk will give it<br>to us all right we've seen this this is<br>you know we are living through this more<br>than ever<br>now of course sadly what did happen was<br>countries stockpiled in self-interest<br>and this study actually shows you that<br>the countries with the highest stockpile<br>had the lowest<br>amount of risk in the lowest number of<br>cases whereas southeast asia whether<br>there was the highest risk head the<br>lowest amount of kidney flu available<br>and couldn't afford it anyway there was<br>also some tightening up of roach<br>and roche manufacturer in fact a nobel<br>prize winning<br>researcher managed to demonstrate that<br>russia's method was not the most<br>effective method<br>but the whole drug is as a whole ended<br>up actually being<br>not all that effective and another<br>commentator has said that<br>was almost as effective okay now this<br>i'm not suggesting in all of the<br>commentators who really outlined this<br>case study<br>that this will happen again right but it<br>does tell you something about state<br>behaviour and the interest<br>that we are seeing that i've also called<br>pharmaceutical nationalism<br>okay another important part of this<br>puzzle is actually data secrecy<br>which stands of opposition to open<br>science in the vaccine provided as a<br>public good<br>so around the world there are stories of<br>regulators and companies working<br>together to fast<br>track vaccine clinical trials and tests<br>and so on<br>but independent review of these<br>processes is enormously important<br>because quite often they don't<br>necessarily work right<br>and this is where data sharing becomes<br>actually enormously important because<br>very clever people can actually make<br>better things by sharing data<br>sooner rather than later the patent<br>system usually tolerates a bit of delay<br>in that because of the calculus it says<br>overall it's a social good so<br>the ip system is on trial and the free<br>trade agreement with the uk<br>should actually provide an opportunity<br>to negotiate into a trade agreement<br>access for new zealand to the medicine<br>so we hear periodically<br>that there are various discussions going<br>on so if one looks at<br>fda's business as usual and allen's<br>outlined in a number of ways<br>because it's not business as usual but<br>one can actually see<br>that ftas do a number of things around<br>patents for medicines<br>so one of those things is to increase<br>data exclusivity<br>that means keeping it to the regulator<br>and to the patent owner<br>new zealand should not agree to any<br>increases in data exclusivity<br>that's something we suspended in the<br>cptpp<br>it's something that's in the eu<br>negotiations more extensive data<br>exclusivity<br>we should not increase the expense of<br>the nature of patent protection in other<br>ways but i'll leave that aside<br>we should not subject pharmac to even<br>more scrutiny which does frequently come<br>up<br>in trade agreements in addition in the<br>negotiations with the uk we should<br>actually<br>not only seek to reduce these things if<br>we can<br>but it might actually be that we need to<br>negotiate the covert exception<br>now in the event of the failure of the<br>uk<br>so let's assume that these uk companies<br>actually do<br>invent a vaccine right they've admitted<br>that it's going to be pretty hard to<br>manufacture enough to supply<br>everyone quickly in the event of the<br>failure of the uk to promptly be able to<br>supply<br>new zealand with a vaccine or a<br>treatment can we have a voluntary<br>license can we say well we'll<br>manufacture it here can you license us<br>the technology that's technology<br>transfer we should negotiate this into<br>the trade deal<br>if not can we have a compulsory licence<br>which basically means you take one for a<br>national emergency now given that this<br>is a pandemic it's an international<br>emergency<br>should we be able to manufacture under<br>those circumstances<br>now it's the 53rd trading interest and i<br>found that really interesting<br>i'm going to suggest why not because<br>we're actually very low risk<br>this is something we actually want from<br>the uk<br>many countries wouldn't get this kind of<br>licensing arrangement because it's too<br>risky for the patent owners<br>now regarding covert treatment and<br>vaccines overall we shouldn't agree to<br>anything<br>in regulatory procedures that's health<br>and safety procedures<br>that prevents information sharing so in<br>order to overcome existing provisions<br>which do actually prevent this kind of<br>clinical dialogue<br>information sharing and these provisions<br>come out of trade agreements which is my<br>own focus and<br>we should in fact have another covert<br>style exception to overcome those<br>existing agreements and that might be<br>information sharing<br>exclusively with the uk the eu and<br>anyone else they're prepared to share<br>with<br>so for covert this to me seems extremely<br>important it provides a unique<br>opportunity to actually challenge what<br>is a pre-existing access to medicine's<br>problem<br>but it really is a different kind of<br>problem in the pandemic and you might<br>ask yourself isn't this important anyway<br>it's quite a covert and i'd agree yes it<br>is but if there's<br>ever a time to actually talk about what<br>encouraging<br>innovation incentives and passive law<br>means in a global economy<br>and what it means for the global supply<br>chain and access and medicines<br>this is the time and we should spend a<br>lot of time focusing on that because<br>with all respect to the very important<br>agriculture and cheese makers of the<br>nation<br>we've heard from the previous speaker<br>it's not going to do that much for us<br>whereas getting quick access to uk<br>innovation technology will now i don't<br>suggest it's easy but let's try and<br>negotiate<br>i've got quite a few slides to<br>just share with you oh no narrow things<br>a little bit and talk about um<br>any implications for exporters but<br>before i get to that<br>sonatex talk of where we are in terms of<br>the actual exchanges and the extent of<br>the exchanges that we have with the uk<br>at the moment so obviously my ultimate<br>goal is to<br>be able to talk about specifics to get<br>to sort of the work now<br>for new zealand exporters but i'll do<br>that at the very very<br>very end i've got maybe three four<br>slides that talk about a painted picture<br>of<br>where we are today and then i'll see if<br>i can<br>extend or open up a sort of um<br>a dialogue in that space so i just<br>i pulled this out of world trade<br>organization<br>2018 report for 2017 data<br>i i decided to bring this out just so we<br>recognize uh the fact that most of our<br>conversations these days around<br>i in this space and i think uh alan<br>brought that up earlier on as well and<br>for various reasons<br>and in most cases for good reasons but i<br>want to draw your attention to the fact<br>that<br>the uk is still a very major trading<br>economy in the grand scheme of things<br>yes right the numbers the numbers favor<br>this side of the screen<br>oh sorry the numbers do favor you know<br>the bigger<br>the bigger circle there but the uk is<br>still in his own right<br>a very very significant trading nation<br>and that's kind of<br>where we want to see if we can do more<br>better<br>with the free trade agreement now<br>how does the ua uk rank<br>versus uh compared to our other major<br>trading partners<br>so i've got this out of statistics in<br>new zealand do take note of the fact<br>that it says<br>year end in march 2020 so you might<br>notice a slight discrepancy here<br>uh now is it number six sixth uh biggest<br>trading partner is it seven<br>yeah it comes in at seven simply because<br>i've got the first quarter of 2020<br>included in there and dropped the first<br>quarter of 2019 okay so that's<br>that's the difference between the sixth<br>uh this is the seventh<br>but that's just an aside what i want to<br>draw your attention to is actually this<br>the exports right that's what i care<br>deeply about uh<br>a 3.81 3.18 billion<br>so if you sorted that that would be our<br>fifth most important ratio destination<br>that's a bit of a surprise right but we<br>never really talk about it and i know<br>the numbers again<br>you know the numbers do favor the bigger<br>markets right<br>we've got the 3g 20 you know billion<br>dollar range there<br>but this is still a significant trading<br>partner<br>in its own right even under the current<br>circumstances<br>now what might a free trade agreement do<br>for us and this is where a lot of the<br>debate is and the modeling there are<br>some uh<br>ironies uh referred to and i'll try to<br>bring across some of the numbers and<br>what they show<br>around what how things might look like<br>all right so if you go on the uk's<br>website<br>uk government website sort of the<br>equivalent of mfa to nzte that kind of<br>modeling to varying degrees very few<br>reports there two or three some of them<br>are very very interesting<br>and i've just pulled some uh some of the<br>analysis that they've run the grammar<br>they're putting a long run analysis<br>you know sort of 10 15 years kind of 20<br>30<br>type thinking regarding what might<br>happen so i don't<br>report here what they predict for for<br>for the uk economy obviously i'm<br>more interested in what they are saying<br>might happen to uh<br>to the to new zealand's exports there<br>are two separate similar scenarios that<br>they've mapped out<br>okay so scenario one i think alan and um<br>and susie might want to weigh in on this<br>again perhaps later on<br>regarding the what is actually been done<br>specifically here<br>but scenario one is uh<br>uk goes for substantial tariff<br>liberalization new zealand<br>uh goes with full liberalization and 25<br>percent declining in non-chief measures<br>and then that will translate<br>approximately to 15 percent<br>increase in exports in 2030 that's kind<br>of<br>what this says the second projection<br>scenario two is<br>uh more positive<br>than that but it's predicated on the on<br>the basis that<br>both you both are new zealand and the uk<br>committee to full liberalization<br>plus a 50 percent reduction in uncharted<br>measures<br>projections that that exports will go to<br>as high as 40 percent<br>an increase of 40 percent again this is<br>not short-term right<br>10 15 years uh downstream so these are<br>the two<br>uh sort of projections i've looked at<br>that i've said oh this is a bit<br>uh interesting now where will those<br>opportunities come from i wouldn't spend<br>time on this i think uh<br>alan has uh talked about this i think<br>susie has covered this<br>varying degrees as well so we know food<br>and beverage<br>sort of right our sort of our bread and<br>butter really<br>will be sort of uh quite well covered in<br>this or should be<br>an area where we might see increases<br>digital trade<br>and services and exodus recovered a<br>number of uh<br>dimensions associated with digital<br>trading services<br>again um when she talked about<br>intellectual property so these are some<br>of the sectors where we think<br>that growth will come will come from<br>now so i'll leave you with the slide<br>here the very last one i won't<br>uh talk too much to it but i think it<br>alludes to something that<br>i mentioned earlier on that this is very<br>different in that we are sort of<br>re-engaging<br>a market that we've always been involved<br>with the market with whom we have a rich<br>history<br>so it's not it's not like with other<br>french<br>agreements where we've you know had a<br>free trade agreement they have to spend<br>time trying to learn to understand that<br>market<br>trying to promote that opportunity that<br>might exist in that kind<br>in that market this is a very very<br>different market that we<br>all know that we are familiar with<br>so with that say that kind of went back<br>to some of<br>the sources that i was mentioning<br>earlier on some of the trade the trade<br>information<br>that the uk government has on the<br>website and they've got something that i<br>found to be quite interesting<br>they know the number at least to uh<br>to a certain degree they know the number<br>of fans and actually<br>exports to new zealand right<br>and they also know the number of films<br>that import from new zealand they know<br>that they have that information and i'll<br>bring up the resource here where you can<br>find that information so for a start<br>seven thousand and i'll put up the the<br>reference here there are seven thousand<br>uk businesses<br>that export to new zealand okay<br>and um the 375 000 here as you see 375<br>714 worth of products that you see is a<br>division of the 2.63 billion that we do<br>in in uh in imports divided by the<br>number of<br>firms that's what that would give you<br>okay 2.63 billion<br>that i showed you as impulse in 2018<br>divided by that will give you the<br>375 000 but i'm less interested in that<br>i'm more interested in these right<br>because these are the exports the the<br>imports that uk businesses make from new<br>zealand are the experts<br>for us from on this end and you will<br>notice here that's just two thousand<br>they said it's about roughly two<br>thousand businesses<br>that actually buy out out of the uk that<br>buy new zealand product<br>and they tend to buy quite a bit of one<br>and a half million<br>with for averaging that out of the<br>business<br>so if i'm looking at this i can't have<br>several thoughts regarding the types of<br>businesses that we may be dealing with<br>in the uk<br>so maybe if you are importing from the<br>uk you're most likely dealing with<br>a lot of smes but if you are exporting<br>they will be dealing with<br>larger organizations or with large<br>powerful distributors<br>and there are implications uh to how<br>businesses might want to approach that<br>so it's sort of a question that i want<br>to leave you with a couple of questions<br>really<br>if we are looking at this especially the<br>second uh the second<br>statistic that i have days this so if we<br>are to grow<br>we have to realize that 15 to 40 percent<br>growth what we're really thinking about<br>is what you see in this last<br>graphic year so can we grow that number<br>from 2000<br>two thousand five hundred whatever<br>number that helps us create<br>uh may help us bring the opportunity to<br>fruition that's one way to think about<br>it<br>another way to think about is can we<br>increase<br>the average transaction the average<br>uh the size of the average um<br>importation from uh<br>from new zealand by by a uk exporter<br>from<br>you know one half million to however<br>many so that's kind of<br>and that's the thinking when i start to<br>put on my sort of<br>trade development expert promotion type<br>and this is what i sort of start to<br>think about and i've just done in this<br>sort of<br>i say as a conversation starter thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
