brought up in the u.s for those<br>who don't know and i think we're going<br>to hear more about<br>israeli life in his talk<br>he went to university first at the<br>university of boston and received a ba<br>in psychology in 1988.<br>he then went to cincinnati the cape<br>western reserve<br>university where he obtained an m.a<br>in psychology in 1993 and then phd<br>also in psychology in 1995.<br>the next 10 years were characterized by<br>some movement around the globe<br>postdoctoral training at the university<br>of virginia<br>a lectureship in the uk at the<br>university of plymouth<br>for moving to the southern hemisphere<br>and the university of southern<br>queensland for another lectureship now i<br>had to look up where the university of<br>southern queensland was<br>and for those who don't know it's in<br>toowoomba which is west of brisbane<br>and having traveled with joe in<br>australia i mean that is<br>the reason why he's a dual australian<br>citizen some of you may not know<br>he uh moved across the tasman to brief<br>positions at both lincoln university and<br>university of canterbury<br>before joining this campus and the<br>christchurch health and development<br>study<br>in 2005 as a research fellow he was<br>promoted<br>to senior research fellow in 2008<br>research associate professor in 2013 and<br>obviously in the latest round to<br>research professor<br>and during that time taking on<br>increasing leadership roles<br>with the christchurch health and<br>development study versus deputy director<br>and their mayor's director<br>which he now holds that posted<br>research interests psychosocial causes<br>and consequences<br>of substance use abuse and dependence<br>mental health and substance use<br>epidemiology<br>social and psychological determinants of<br>maladaptive behavior including<br>aggression and violence<br>and i decided to try it out by putting<br>his uh publications into a word cloud<br>program obviously the first the major<br>word was bowden but once we got rid of<br>that one<br>not surprisingly alcohol addiction<br>outcomes<br>cannabis self-esteem dependence<br>personality with a<br>kind of prominent words uh joe's notable<br>for<br>for many things he's a highly productive<br>uh researcher um as is typical for<br>for the unit that he works in<br>approaching 200 publications a large<br>number of collaborations<br>and certainly joe is known as a very<br>generous collaborator<br>his recent more recent work at the<br>science policy interface and that's<br>that's a space that not many of us go<br>into very often but is a very important<br>one and be able to navigate that<br>is a is a really vital part of academia<br>and joe does that very well<br>and not surprisingly and as a<br>consequence is widely sought after for<br>media commentaries explaining the<br>science to public and<br>is in hot demand at times particularly<br>when there's a cannabis referendum<br>coming up<br>and also just a a personal note as well<br>i think often service activities or<br>some that we don't often um acknowledge<br>as much as we<br>should in university but joe's is a<br>highly valued colleague for the work<br>the service work he does for this campus<br>and the university and there'd be many<br>such activities and some of them quite<br>challenging and as an example<br>he uh willingly i say willingly maybe<br>not so well he took over<br>where i was co-lead on our workspace<br>user group for the building which is one<br>of the more challenging one has been<br>absolutely<br>key in that role in navigating obviously<br>quite a<br>um an area of great interest to all of<br>us here but we can greatly appreciate it<br>joe received our highest research<br>award the research gold medal in 2017.<br>and tonight he's going to talk about his<br>background<br>early interests how they influenced his<br>career choice<br>uh talk about research on substance use<br>aggressive violent defending<br>and how his research has moved into the<br>policy sphere so<br>welcome joe bowden<br>just testing if that's if it's working<br>hit the team<br>tanakoto kotwa thank you very much for<br>coming along this evening um i certainly<br>do appreciate it<br>one of the main problems that i had when<br>i started to try to<br>formulate this lecture was really down<br>to the kind of<br>work that we do at the christchurch<br>health and development study<br>it is we're really about a method<br>of studying people's lives over a long<br>period of time<br>from birth now to in our cohort to age<br>43.<br>and in doing so we've got to look at a<br>broad range of different topics<br>but sometimes we tend to do that in a<br>little bit of a shallow way possibly<br>as compared with with some other<br>researchers so<br>what i'm going to talk about today<br>really are a bunch of things<br>a number of papers and projects that i<br>found<br>interesting and challenging over the<br>years and just give you<br>a little bit of a snapshot of what it's<br>like to<br>to to do this over the years<br>um and a little bit about myself of<br>course<br>sorry i'm really nervous i don't get<br>nervous before<br>i'm really excited to do this it's<br>brushing against<br>it and the words should be heard thank<br>you okay<br>so i'm from that little red dot on the<br>map<br>i'd say bustling metropolis called<br>pittsfield massachusetts<br>and i was born there at the end of 1966.<br>to<br>very young parents 23 and 21<br>they actually lived in the in the town<br>next door called dalton which was<br>an even more bustling metropolis of 7500<br>people<br>and um as you can see it's uh<br>well you can't actually actually<br>estimate that that's about a three hour<br>drive from<br>my hometown to boston and about a three<br>hour drive from my hometown to new york<br>city<br>so well situated um<br>but when i was nine years old we<br>actually<br>up and moved one whole mile to<br>pittsfield<br>where i spent the rest of my childhood<br>which i'll say more about in a minute<br>now my family has resided in pittsfield<br>for many generations<br>and still does so my parents live there<br>my brother<br>but my ancestors actually have been in<br>north america<br>for thousands of years so<br>some of my ancestors are members of the<br>conework hay<br>mohawk tribe others arrived there<br>rather later from europe but i'd like to<br>focus on<br>one ancestor in particular and that is<br>my great great grandfather nicholas<br>bowden<br>now nicholas bowden was born in a<br>village just outside of heidelberg<br>in germany in 1837<br>and i don't know that much about him but<br>what i do know is that<br>when he was a teenager he got on a boat<br>and sailed to the united states<br>he landed in boston and eventually not<br>long after<br>turned up in pittsfield where he and his<br>wife raised three children<br>so that's the story of how my family got<br>there<br>my family are i come from a family of<br>very practical<br>people so my dad that's me in the red<br>and white stripes there on the left<br>that was taken about 1974. and<br>my dad and my little brother and that's<br>my grandfather<br>very practical people so my dad was a<br>skilled machinist<br>my grandfather started life as a<br>professional musician<br>but eventually stopped being a musician<br>and<br>ended up working on a you know in a<br>paper mill<br>on a machine my other grandfather was a<br>welder<br>so really my family didn't have a great<br>deal<br>of experience with<br>further education or higher education<br>anything like that<br>in fact i'm the very first person in my<br>family to go to university<br>and never mind get three degrees<br>others later followed me of course but<br>i'm from this background<br>and i wanted to show you the picture of<br>my grandfather because<br>every every lucky kid has a person<br>when they're a little kid that is the<br>person who means an awful lot to them<br>with whom they have a really close<br>relationship<br>and who really sees them through uh<br>season through life and that and that<br>was my grandfather<br>um i was a bit of a bright kid<br>and my grandfather really encouraged<br>this he always wanted to<br>know how well i was doing in school what<br>my assignments were<br>and we would read to each other and tell<br>each other the jokes out of<br>reader's digest and and all those sorts<br>of things so<br>really um i just wanted to recognize my<br>my grandfather because he's one of the<br>main reasons why<br>why i'm here today speaking to you my<br>family's always been supportive even<br>though<br>they didn't have the background in this<br>i'm not that was taking it<br>i think when i was at home um they<br>didn't although not having the<br>background they were always<br>supportive of my endeavors i think they<br>probably recognized that that<br>academic things were really the only<br>thing i was good at so<br>they wanted to push me in that direction<br>i suppose um<br>and and so much so that for example my<br>dad<br>um you know was a very hard worker would<br>work 12-hour shifts<br>five days a week and another half day on<br>saturdays<br>back in the 80s um and they my parents<br>took out a second mortgage<br>on their home to ensure that i could<br>finish my undergraduate degree<br>so i certainly owe my family a very<br>large debt of gratitude<br>so that's me when i was 12.<br>the reason for this picture of me will<br>become apparent in a moment<br>but in anticipation of this lecture i<br>asked my mother a few weeks ago what was<br>i like when i was that<br>and she said well exactly what i thought<br>she would say she said<br>you were quiet um you were studious you<br>basically read<br>any book you could get your hands on um<br>and that really i think described me<br>well<br>and what i remember of childhood was<br>that the very<br>first thing that i wanted to be was<br>a scientist no jokes about<br>soft science please i wanted to be a<br>scientist<br>and the reason i wanted to be a<br>scientist because my favorite tv show<br>was star trek<br>and my favorite character was mr spock<br>who was a scientist<br>and who got to help his mates out he was<br>really really smart<br>and got to help his mates out because<br>being a scientist is all about flying<br>around in space with your mates having<br>great adventures<br>isn't it i would have thought that when<br>i was five but<br>obviously this hasn't come to pass yet<br>um<br>after that i thought a little bit about<br>oh maybe i'd like to be a writer<br>so i've done a bit of that over the<br>years as part of this job<br>and then i thought for a while that i<br>might like to go into<br>medicine because i wanted to be hawkeye<br>for mash for<br>but obviously these things did not<br>happen<br>what i did do when i was 17 years old go<br>down the road to boston to boston<br>university<br>where i did in fact start that pre-med<br>course which lasted exactly one year<br>because i hated all my classes except<br>one<br>and that was psychology the study of<br>human behavior absolutely fascinated me<br>whereas biology chemistry and calculus i<br>thought were terrible<br>so i decided instead of that and i<br>wasn't doing well anyway<br>i would do psychology instead and work<br>toward the<br>psychology degree and when i got that in<br>1988<br>and what happened is i i went to work<br>in a non-governmental organization<br>that specialize in residential mental<br>health treatment for<br>people with very severe um and<br>long-lasting mental illness primarily<br>schizophrenia but<br>a number of other disorders as well and<br>it was really<br>really hard work and really emotionally<br>draining<br>and about a year and a half into it i<br>realized that i probably wasn't cut out<br>to do it<br>so with the help of a couple of friends<br>who were doing their phds at bu<br>i ended up applying<br>to do that i thought well i've got a<br>psychology degree perhaps i could be a<br>professor<br>and moved moved to cleveland to case<br>western reserve<br>where you see me walking through<br>graduation there<br>after i received my phd in 1995 and that<br>now one of the the biggest breaks of my<br>life was in 2004<br>was being hired by david ferguson and<br>john horwood to do to be the new<br>research fellow at the christchurch<br>health and wellness study<br>that apparently the hr office nearly<br>lost my application<br>so it came close but i did get the job<br>and it was really one of the luckiest<br>breaks i ever got<br>in my previous life having studied as a<br>experimental social psychologist have<br>spent a great deal of time doing<br>theoretical work<br>or torturing undergraduates that is<br>putting them into experiments where i<br>would show them unpleasant things and<br>all those sorts of things but it didn't<br>have a lot of<br>ecological validity there wasn't a lot<br>of the real world<br>involved in what i was doing and<br>that's really to me one of the most<br>important things about being able to do<br>this job is is having real world data to<br>hand<br>to look at problems that people<br>are really suffering from and the first<br>area that i want to talk about<br>are drugs now i became interested in<br>drugs not for the<br>not for any reasons that you laugh about<br>but growing up in the 70s<br>adults were really pure out preoccupied<br>with<br>young people taking drugs and so<br>we have things like on the left is a<br>panel from a comic book in 1970 that<br>said<br>kids who take drugs are losers well<br>way to shame people or or<br>speed kills that came out later in the<br>70s<br>to try to frighten you so the adults<br>were very preoccupied<br>with this idea of drugs and drug taking<br>and<br>and they seemed to spend a lot of time<br>and emotional energy on it<br>so it's set me to wondering being a<br>curious young person<br>what is this what is this all about um<br>and in fact<br>one of the defining experiences in this<br>was<br>when i was a kid in our old house we had<br>a big kid who lived across the street i<br>said big kid he was probably about 18<br>but that we were afraid of him vaguely<br>afraid of it his name was pat<br>and one day there was a terrible<br>commotion outside and we looked out and<br>there was about<br>10 police cars surrounding pat's house<br>and they were leading him out<br>in handcuffs pat was a drug dealer<br>and he just got arrested and that day my<br>dad said we're moving to a better<br>neighborhood<br>and we did i<br>had the police thing in there just to<br>remind me to tell the pat's story<br>so i was very interested in all of these<br>things<br>but there was no real source of reliable<br>information<br>to a young person or i didn't know of<br>any and certainly the adults didn't want<br>to talk to you about it they just<br>wanted to say don't don't do that so i<br>did what any other smart kid would do<br>and i went to the library<br>school library in this case and i took<br>out this book<br>now i actually own a copy of this book<br>now i bought it in anticipation of this<br>lecture last year<br>see how confident i was<br>it says it's what you what you should<br>know about drugs and drug abuse and it's<br>written to young people<br>so you know people 13 14 years old and i<br>was 12 when i read it i must have read<br>it 10 times<br>and it it's incredible it has a huge<br>amount of information about different<br>drugs what they do<br>how dangerous they are what are the and<br>all of these things<br>that answered all of my questions that i<br>had as a as a curious<br>12 year old um and it was<br>it was really a godsend in that sense<br>but i think<br>really sparked that interest<br>that scholarly interest in this<br>particular topic<br>but i didn't really get to do too much<br>until the chds<br>now one of the first tasks that david<br>ferguson gave me in terms of<br>papers to write and this was how david<br>worked he said well<br>i've got an idea for paper and this is<br>what we're doing is we wanted to<br>to be able to look at the prevalence of<br>illicit drug use in the chds cohort as<br>an updated sort of thing he had written<br>a paper about it earlier but we wanted<br>to update it<br>since we had data to age 25.<br>and just a few things to notice about<br>this<br>so for example we've got the cannabis<br>use on on the left<br>and when they were 15 there was just<br>under 10 using<br>but by age 18 that was half the cohort<br>it was the estimate for the number of<br>people who had used cannabis at least<br>once<br>and by age 25 that number had risen to<br>76.7 now the significance of this is<br>as you may or may be aware i'm pretty<br>heavily involved in the cannabis law<br>reform debate<br>here in new zealand and<br>one of the numbers that gets tossed<br>around a lot<br>inaccurately i should add is that 80<br>of kiwis have tried cannabis<br>and where that number comes from is a<br>rounding up of that number that i<br>generated<br>so in a sense i was very thrilled that<br>people started using this and it became<br>part of the discourse<br>it's not quite right it's not entirely<br>accurate um<br>because really what it means is that<br>76.7 percent<br>of 43 year olds have tried cannabis<br>to be more accurate but it was very<br>pleasing to<br>um to be part of the discourse in that<br>way<br>and you can see the other numbers as<br>well<br>now not wasn't long after that david<br>came up with another<br>really interesting idea and i do miss<br>david<br>which was one of my favorite papers of<br>all time<br>and previously david and john had looked<br>at<br>the relationship or the association<br>between cannabis use and other illicit<br>drug use<br>to see whether the extent to which are<br>trying to quantify<br>the extent to which cannabis could be a<br>causal<br>agent and other illicit drug use<br>and so what we wanted to do with this<br>paper is first of all update it using<br>the age 25 data that we had so we had 11<br>years<br>of cannabis data at the time rather than<br>the much smaller<br>amount that they had used in the<br>previous paper but also for technical<br>reasons<br>because when we're talking about trying<br>to model an association between an<br>exposure<br>cannabis and an outcome other illicit<br>drug use<br>we have to take into account factors<br>that could confound<br>this association statistically right so<br>things that happened prior to the<br>exposure<br>that could have caused both cannabis use<br>and other illicit drug use<br>and as you might imagine since we<br>started the chds<br>um at birth and have measured many<br>aspects<br>of their life and family functioning and<br>many things over the years you might<br>imagine that we have a huge<br>range of variables that we can include<br>in this kind of confounding analysis and<br>you'd be correct<br>the trouble is that there's always an<br>argument in the background that says<br>you can't have measured everything<br>that is there must be there must<br>necessarily be something there<br>that you haven't measured and therefore<br>haven't accounted for<br>so this was way back in 2005 and<br>um at the time david had been using a<br>technique that was not well known that<br>well known the literature had been used<br>in<br>economics and other areas not so much in<br>epidemiology of psychiatric epidemiology<br>and that is a fixed effects regression<br>model<br>and what this does i'm not going to show<br>you the math<br>so you don't have to worry about that<br>but what this does<br>is it allows you to to control<br>for no all non-observed sources of<br>confounding between<br>that exposure cannabis and the outcome<br>of the illicit drug use<br>so it's just a way of trying to have a<br>more precise formulation of what<br>we think that association looks like<br>so what i loved about this was was well<br>i was hired for the job because i had<br>some<br>some quantitative ability the first year<br>of this job was like trying to<br>scale a sheer wall with very few tools<br>in terms of developing my technique but<br>it was a real challenge and i<br>so what we found and this is a real<br>simplification<br>as you might guess after we controlled<br>for all non-observed sources of<br>confounding and some<br>time dynamic covariate factors so things<br>that occur during that period 15 to 25<br>like life stress<br>or affiliation with deviant peers so<br>people who do drugs and break the law<br>that sort of thing you still have a very<br>strong association between cannabis use<br>and other illicit drug use so if you're<br>a weekly<br>or better cannabis user and this is<br>these are fully adjusted models and<br>aggregated over the period 15 to 25 your<br>rates of otherwise drug use are 10 times<br>higher<br>than for people who didn't use cannabis<br>now what this graph obscures is that<br>there is actually<br>in the data a very strong age gradient<br>such that<br>when you're 15 years old if you're a<br>regular cannabis user your chances of<br>using other illicit drugs are 66 times<br>higher<br>than if you don't um and then that<br>gradient<br>drops all the way to three times higher<br>by age 25<br>suggesting that there's a there's a<br>vulnerability for young people in terms<br>of<br>accessing cannabis and then having the<br>ability to access<br>other illicit drugs but it was a it was<br>a lovely challenge<br>just to change gears slightly we'll move<br>to<br>alcohol which apparently there we go<br>which is also a drug but legal<br>and in the literature that's been well<br>known for a very long time<br>that there is a reasonably strong<br>correlation between having problems with<br>alcohol<br>and having symptoms of major depressive<br>disorder<br>but what's not known is if there's a<br>if there's a causal association at work<br>which way does the error go<br>does it go from having alcohol problems<br>to being depressed<br>does it go from being depressed to<br>having alcohol problems does it go both<br>ways<br>is there a little bit of influence in<br>both directions<br>we fitted a structural equation model<br>i knew there'd be a laugh the<br>undergraduates get even more scared of<br>this<br>when you show them but it's really very<br>fairly simple all you need to know about<br>um we have alcohol on the right and<br>that is a latent non-observed tendency<br>to alcohol problems<br>we've got depression on the left which<br>is again a latent non-observed tendency<br>toward depressive symptomatology which<br>are correlated that's the big bar at the<br>bottom<br>but what you're most interested in are<br>those pathways b1<br>and b2 and those pathways<br>are measuring the extent to which<br>alcohol<br>causes alcohol problems with alcohol<br>cause<br>depression that's b1 and pathway b2 that<br>we estimated<br>is how much depression caused alcohol<br>problems and just to cut the story very<br>short<br>the answer is it's the alcohol so<br>we found a statistically significant<br>pathway b1<br>such that alcohol use disorder<br>led to depressing but not the other way<br>around<br>so the take home message for the<br>physicians in the audience is<br>if you've got someone who's got alcohol<br>problems and they're depressed<br>get them to stop drinking so finally for<br>drugs<br>this is a paper that actually came out<br>earlier this year<br>where we looked at we took the<br>cannabis frequency data so for each year<br>we ask people how frequently have you<br>used cannabis in<br>in during that 12-month period and we<br>took<br>now so that would have been 20 years of<br>data<br>and aggregated that in order to fit<br>latent trajectory models so we wanted to<br>find out if there were groupings within<br>the cohort that could describe the<br>progress or<br>change of their cannabis use over their<br>lifetimes<br>and of course we could otherwise it<br>wouldn't have got published<br>so as you see there we've got non-users<br>and occasional users and<br>um but what we're most interested in<br>primarily of course<br>are the chronic long-term chronic users<br>and as you can see<br>they ramped up their cannabis use quite<br>quickly and<br>they remained avid cannabis consumers<br>and they have done so throughout their<br>lives<br>these people are very interested in this<br>sort of thing<br>and as you might guess the rate of<br>psychosocial<br>problems in this group is a bit higher<br>um than it would be in the general<br>population<br>so you see things like um a history of<br>school failure<br>unemployment um major depression and and<br>some other<br>things as well amongst this group so<br>while<br>some a number of them are engaging in<br>their cannabis use unproblematically<br>there are higher rates of problems in<br>the group<br>but what's probably a little bit more<br>interesting is that orange group<br>and those people when they started out<br>life looking like the occasional users<br>but somehow around age 25 they suddenly<br>begot<br>became interested in cannabis and they<br>started to approach rates of youth that<br>look like the long-term chronic people<br>and what's notable about this is a<br>number of the predictors and risk<br>factors are very similar<br>so for example one of the predictors<br>they have in common with the chronic<br>users<br>are is school failure but<br>they failed out of school before they<br>started using canvas<br>so it suggests the possibility<br>that some people who are adult drug<br>users are actually selected<br>into that drug use i could talk about<br>that longer but<br>i've run out of time to talk about that<br>so to switch over to crime really what<br>i'm<br>mostly interested in for this these<br>purposes is violence<br>i don't have a really funny or<br>interesting story to tell you about how<br>i got interested<br>in violence as a topic um except to say<br>that i was an undersized kid who was too<br>smart for his own good and had a big<br>mouth<br>which meant i got into lots of scrapes<br>and they always left me very upset and<br>but i noticed that some of the other<br>kids<br>actually didn't seem to be bothered by<br>this it was just i don't know a normal<br>part of their day<br>and a number of them really enjoyed it<br>which was very paradoxical<br>and i couldn't quite work out why that<br>was and i think again sparked<br>some curiosity about this and the first<br>time that i ever had a chance to<br>to study it was in the context<br>of a very large project that i<br>was lucky enough to be a part of because<br>so one day my supervisor wrote bob<br>monster<br>he was on sabbatical at the university<br>of virginia<br>and i happened to be sitting in the lab<br>next to the phone the phone rang i<br>picked it up<br>and it was roy saying i've got a project<br>i want to do and<br>do you want to work on it with me and i<br>said immediately said yes<br>and it was good that i said yes because<br>this paper has been cited now it's<br>almost 25 years old it's been cited more<br>than 1300 times<br>and in fact i have a citation alert and<br>every friday<br>i get at least one new citation for the<br>paper 25 years it's the gift that keeps<br>well what we did and this is going back<br>to being a social psychologist which<br>meant<br>it's a it's a theoretical work based on<br>a very extensive literature review<br>which meant that i spent the entire<br>summer of 1994 in the library<br>which was fine because the library was<br>air conditioned<br>but i did spend the summer in the<br>library and as you remember hand<br>trolling journals for articles that<br>might<br>that might have otherwise escaped your<br>notice from the search engines and those<br>sorts of things<br>and the idea that roy had was this he<br>was a researcher in<br>social psychology the self being one of<br>his major research interests<br>and in the 1980s social psychologists<br>well this actually<br>really came into popular culture<br>self-esteem was<br>the thing in the united states that is<br>it was basically the the reason if you<br>had<br>high self-esteem it's the reason why you<br>succeeded because you had it<br>and why good things happened to you and<br>alternatively if you had low self-esteem<br>bad things would happen to you all<br>number of bad things<br>so of course nothing really works like<br>that it's certainly not that powerful<br>but<br>one of the things that we wanted to<br>study was the fact or statements about<br>the that self-esteem is related to<br>violence such that people with low<br>self-esteem<br>are violent and aggressive and this was<br>actually believed at the time<br>and roy said let's let's test this let's<br>let's try to see if this is true<br>and i can tell you in the entire<br>literature that i searched that summer<br>we could<br>we could find one paper that linked low<br>self-esteem<br>and violence and that was a study<br>of women who had been incarcerated for<br>physical child abuse and in these<br>this determination was made when they<br>were being interviewed<br>just before they were released from<br>prison so of course<br>they have been incarcerated for beating<br>their children<br>of course they have low self-esteem<br>they're not not going to think very<br>highly of themselves<br>but we couldn't find anything else and<br>in fact all we did find<br>was examples from the literature of<br>higher levels of self-esteem being<br>related to violent behavior<br>so we came up with this theory and<br>psychological review is a journal where<br>you're allowed to do it<br>you're allowed to create a theoretical<br>theory based on<br>a literature search and it's a it's a<br>so what we essentially theorized was<br>something like this<br>i actually drove drew this figure on an<br>old apple mac in the mid-1990s<br>and it appears in the journal article so<br>on one side we have a favorable view of<br>itself<br>that's unstable perhaps inflated<br>uncertain a bit like a president we all<br>know<br>and we have negative evaluations by<br>and you have this discrepancy that's<br>created this is what we call threatened<br>egotism<br>and what happens if person reaches a<br>choice point if they decide to reject<br>the appraisal<br>one way that they can do this is if they<br>have very strong negative feelings about<br>this<br>is through violence and aggression again<br>fully theoretical made it up in our<br>heads<br>and it's still pulling down citations to<br>this day<br>but what it needed what it needed was<br>some empirical testing<br>now roy and a colleague of his brad<br>bushman did a study in the early 2000s<br>where they looked they undertook a<br>laboratory exploration of this idea<br>which involved manipulating<br>undergraduates into thinking something<br>was true that wasn't<br>and and all these things and it looked<br>like<br>the hypothesis could be true but again<br>it's a<br>highly contrived laboratory situation<br>with undergraduates who are not<br>typical members of the public and<br>after i got to the chds<br>it became apparent that i could actually<br>perform a much more ecologically valid<br>test of this hypothesis using our data<br>when the cohort members were 10 years<br>old and again when they were 15<br>they received a self-esteem measure<br>and now those data had just been were in<br>the data bank<br>but what we wanted to look at was the<br>association between self-esteem<br>when they were 15 and 10 and<br>violent self-reported violent offending<br>and also hostility as measured by the<br>symptom checklist 90. and at the<br>bivariate level that is before you just<br>for anything it looked like low<br>self-esteem was related to more<br>violent behavior but adjusting for conf<br>potential confounding factors reduced<br>this association to<br>non-significance basically saying that<br>this apparent relationship between<br>self-esteem and violent offending was<br>really due to all the things that could<br>possibly<br>lower your self-esteem and make it more<br>likely that you're going to behave<br>violently now the the association with<br>hostility actually hung in there<br>suggesting that people with low<br>self-esteem are hostile<br>and they express hostility when they're<br>asked to um so that hung<br>in there but more slightly more<br>interesting was<br>a way of looking at self-esteem<br>stability remember we had two measures<br>so we could look at people who had a<br>high score one time and keeping in mind<br>that a high score in self-esteem is<br>really really high<br>low score is more like the middle of the<br>scale somewhere<br>so people who had scored high on it at<br>one point<br>and lower on it at another and we could<br>compare those unstable people to people<br>who were either<br>stably high or stably low<br>and as you might guess our<br>hypothesis was confirmed there was an<br>association between<br>having unstable self-esteem and behaving<br>violently or self-reported violent<br>offending<br>and hostility too<br>just remembering periodically<br>remembering<br>and that hung in after adjustment for<br>confounding so<br>actually a way of using real world data<br>to test a hypothesis that we had come up<br>with just off the back of an envelope i<br>suppose<br>once upon a time in the 90s<br>now um in 2010 we got a<br>an hrc uh project grant to look at<br>alcohol<br>uh use problems associated with alcohol<br>use in the cohort<br>and one of the analysis that we wanted<br>to undertake was a link between<br>problems with alcohol and violent<br>behavior<br>and the reason we wanted it seems like a<br>no-brainer in a sense that of course we<br>know that people who have problems with<br>alcohol are more violent<br>but we really wanted to quantify this<br>and and estimate it as accurately as<br>possible and also use these<br>fixed effects models for controlling for<br>non-observed confounding<br>which hadn't really been done in the<br>literature previously<br>so on this paper we had data to age 30<br>and we looked at self-reported violent<br>offending from age 17 to age 30.<br>intimate partner violence perpetration<br>so physical intimate<br>partner violence perpetration also<br>violence victimization and physical<br>intimate partner bonds victimization and<br>as you can see the people in the<br>in the group that was reporting the<br>largest number of<br>symptoms of alcohol use disorder we used<br>to call it alcohol abuse independence we<br>don't anymore<br>most symptoms of alcohol use disorder<br>had rates of violent offending that was<br>over three and a half times higher than<br>people who had no symptoms<br>and this is after adjustment for<br>non-observed fixed confounding<br>anti-dynamic covariates we also saw<br>that they had rates of physical intimate<br>partner violence perpetration that were<br>more than two times higher than people<br>who didn't have any alcohol problems<br>and rates of violence victimization that<br>were almost twice as high<br>as those who didn't have any alcohol<br>problems the last one didn't hang in<br>there<br>so we could say that even after<br>controlling for every sort of<br>possible confounding that we could put<br>in it's clear<br>that having problems with alcohol which<br>usually goes along with having a higher<br>level of alcohol consumption<br>leads to more violent defense<br>self-reported violent offending<br>intimate partner violence and<br>victimization<br>but that's it for the crime because i'm<br>actually<br>running perilously close on time i think<br>um<br>one of the great things about this job<br>as opposed to being an experimental<br>social psychologist<br>working in a health field with real<br>world longitudinal data<br>is being able to become involved in<br>policy<br>a lot of researchers don't ever get to<br>see<br>what the the value or the use of their<br>research is<br>and if i had stayed doing theoretical<br>models and things i never would have<br>either<br>but again i got very lucky in being able<br>to to<br>be involved in this and so the first<br>time that i ever<br>did this that's<br>a picture of the legislative council<br>chamber<br>in parliament house in wellington it is<br>the former<br>meeting place of the upper house<br>of new zealand's parliament which voted<br>to dissolve itself<br>permanently in 1949 so<br>the room was no is no longer was no<br>longer used for<br>law making but instead for people giving<br>talks and things like that<br>and in 2006 i got invited to go up and<br>speak at the drugs policy<br>roundtable along with a number of other<br>researchers<br>in fact i went up um david was meant to<br>go but he had kidney stones and he said<br>i<br>i should go um i was very nervous<br>because i'd<br>never given a talk in such a important<br>seeming room before<br>but it was really a good experience for<br>the first half of the day when we were<br>all giving our talks<br>and then we had lunch and then in the<br>afternoon<br>jim anderton who was the health minister<br>at the time got up and<br>the talks were all about cannabis and<br>talking about reforming cannabis law and<br>he got up and he said well thank you all<br>for your presentations and this<br>information is all well and good but<br>so that took the air out of the room<br>now poor jim had some personal reasons<br>for um<br>having this opinion but um a couple of<br>years later we had another opportunity<br>and the first prime minister's chief<br>science advisor sir peter glockman put<br>together<br>a panel of social science researchers<br>with the task of creating a series of<br>chapters writing a series of chapters<br>that present<br>recommendations for how to improve<br>the transition through life for young<br>people that is specifically the<br>transition from childhood to adolescence<br>and then adolescence to adulthood what<br>should we do<br>what policies should we adopt to help<br>kids especially those<br>who are struggling and and having a<br>difficulty with the transition<br>well we actually prepared david and i<br>and harleen hayne<br>prepared three chapters for this<br>first one on childhood conduct problems<br>which is largely derived from david's<br>work<br>from in the advisory group for conduct<br>problems<br>in the last decade but also alcohol use<br>in adolescence and cannabis use in<br>adolescence<br>now i have no idea what sort of impact<br>this<br>had or or didn't have i do know<br>that one of the things that came out<br>after this<br>um certainly due to the advisory group<br>on conduct problems<br>was an increase in in some funding<br>but also the development of new zealand<br>specific programs for<br>kids and families who are at risk and<br>with conduct problems<br>so we're not anywhere near being able to<br>fully address<br>these issues but it did go it did go<br>some way<br>i won't tell you too much about the next<br>one because it was so disappointing<br>you might remember the alcohol reform<br>law that passed in 2012 well i was very<br>involved in advocating for a number of<br>very important reforms<br>none of which were in the finished law<br>thank you crusher<br>yes it was it was crusher who put pay to<br>that<br>so that was very disappointing we'll<br>have another run at it possibly<br>but more recently<br>i've been involved with the ministry of<br>justice in<br>um advising them in the development of<br>the cannabis legalization and control<br>bill<br>so what sort of things from a policy<br>from<br>what did researchers feel were the<br>important things to address<br>in terms of this policy and this this<br>law that's being developed<br>so myself and a number of other people<br>two of whom are in the room<br>um were involved in this process um<br>but also at the same time being invited<br>by the prime minister's chief science<br>advisor juliet jarrod<br>and doug was on the panel two as you can<br>see<br>he probably can't see but um<br>being invited to join the the expert<br>panel on cannabis<br>and our task was to create a<br>public-facing<br>resource whereby a person could and this<br>is<br>a website it was launched on the 7th of<br>july<br>where a person could take any particular<br>issue that they're worried about<br>with respect to the cannabis debate and<br>actually be directed to the relevant<br>research<br>on this particular area about cannabis<br>cannabis related harm<br>and cannabis law reform it's<br>comprehensive it has a frequently asked<br>questions section<br>and i think it's a really valuable<br>resource and i was always quite proud to<br>be a part of this group<br>so it has been a<br>very interesting career i feel very<br>privileged to be able to<br>to do this kind of work um where i get<br>to<br>well i get to come into the office when<br>um i don't have to punch a clock i can<br>think about<br>things that i'm interested in and<br>there's always something new to think<br>about<br>or study or and it's<br>it's endlessly fascinating so i think<br>probably was the right choice for me to<br>do<br>if i had to go back and do it all over<br>again um<br>but honestly i couldn't have done it<br>without the support of<br>many many people um first and foremost<br>my family who are the ones here in the<br>room but also my family<br>back in the states who haven't got<br>thankfully and my friends<br>and colleagues over the years who have<br>made this a really<br>stimulating and fascinating and<br>challenging<br>kind of work to do and and<br>and to my colleagues now who really make<br>coming to work fun<br>and of course all the people that<br>i've had to poke and prod whether it's<br>been in the laboratory as a<br>as a graduate student or<br>christchurch health and development<br>study participants who we have<br>who we have poked and brought and we are<br>and all those people without whom<br>without their time and generosity and<br>providing this data<br>wouldn't we to to look at we wouldn't be<br>able to do the things that we do and i'm<br>really grateful<br>um to everyone for all their support<br>over the years thank you very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
