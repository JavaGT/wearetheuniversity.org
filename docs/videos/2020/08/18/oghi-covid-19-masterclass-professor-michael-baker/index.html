disease<br>epidemiologist<br>with an extensive publication record on<br>pandemics<br>and related research and his talk will<br>focus on<br>understanding my apologies his will<br>his talk will focus on the covert 19<br>elimination strategy<br>white was the best choice for new<br>zealand<br>thank you michael yeah hirokoto and uh<br>thank you very much for inviting me to<br>contribute to this<br>really great um webinar series<br>and uh um so as you've heard um i'm<br>going to talk about<br>the elimination strategy new zealand's<br>adopted and i think i'm going to pick up<br>on some of the<br>themes that philip and joe have already<br>introduced very effectively and<br>again this is work that draws on<br>activities by a number of my<br>collaborators who are listed here<br>so uh this is one of many<br>um images that are circulating around i<br>think this is<br>shows i guess a view from new zealand<br>about<br>the success of our indigenous approach<br>which<br>is still um unique we are the only<br>country<br>in the world as far as i know that has<br>actually published<br>an elimination strategy although many<br>other countries<br>particularly in the asian region have<br>pursued containment<br>and heading towards elimination as well<br>so i'm going to briefly talk about<br>some of the strategic choices that are<br>available<br>mitigation dress elimination and the<br>major components of this strategy<br>um what effect it's had and how we<br>actually continue to maintain<br>elimination and that's obviously very<br>topical now now that we're really in<br>this post-elimination<br>world which is very new for all of us<br>so when we think about how do countries<br>choose what they're going to do<br>and by definition emerging infectious<br>diseases are things we don't know much<br>about<br>and we've got a range of factors we<br>think about that shape our response<br>obviously we think about the impact<br>particularly case fatality risk<br>impact on inequalities transmissibility<br>the pathogen<br>that affects also how easy it is to<br>control it<br>and we have to make decisions in the<br>absence of information<br>and this is often quite terrifying for<br>scientists because<br>we like to be very certain about the<br>advice we give<br>but we're also influenced by our own<br>experience and dogma<br>as well and we have to think about the<br>feasibility of the response in the<br>economics and this is often where<br>the science hits other constraints and<br>your politicians<br>have to in the end make the really tough<br>calls<br>so one of the um and philip<br>philipp hill's already talked about this<br>one of the key factors is mortality<br>and with my colleague nick wilson and<br>others<br>we did the modeling for the ministry of<br>health in february<br>uh that informed the decision making<br>that new zealand made and<br>this suggested that these are the kind<br>of<br>fatalities you might expect if you had a<br>um a wave of tivo 19 infection in new<br>zealand<br>with only a small amount of constraints<br>so obviously this is a large disease<br>burden<br>we explained it as equivalent of 25<br>seasonal influenza seasons<br>the and the other factor that i think is<br>very important in new zealand's<br>inequalities<br>and joe baxter has explained this very<br>well that new zealand has a<br>really terrible legacy of inequalities<br>with both<br>what we say ongoing endemic infections<br>as well as pandemics<br>and this is looking at three influenza<br>pandemics<br>right up even to what would say as<br>recent times<br>we still have markedly market uh ethnic<br>inequalities in uh mortality and that's<br>only one of<br>many indicators of inequity<br>so the choices that countries had well<br>right up until<br>mid march new zealand was heading down<br>the mitigation path<br>we had our pandemic influenza plan it's<br>got this<br>line that we heard a lot about flattened<br>the curve<br>and that was the path we're going down<br>we're going to keep it up for a while<br>stamp it out manage it and<br>manage the post peak so this is based on<br>the fact that you cannot exclude<br>an influenza pandemic the incubation<br>period is short<br>there's a very high proportion of<br>asymptomatic people<br>so um with my colleagues we started to<br>promote an alternative view elimination<br>and this was partly based on the<br>experience of china<br>in terms of its ability its success in<br>containing this pandemic<br>and as we know elimination has got a<br>long track record with infectious<br>diseases<br>it's been around the terminology about<br>30 years you can eliminate some diseases<br>at a country level or regional level and<br>you can<br>aim to eradicate them the global level<br>and the the approach here is really<br>you're stopping the curve<br>and you're not just you're not<br>flattening it anymore<br>and new zealand switched very<br>dramatically to this approach<br>when the prime minister announced on the<br>23rd of march that we are rapidly going<br>to a very high alert level<br>um level four um which was effectively a<br>lockdown<br>so with the animation strategy you've<br>just got these<br>three fairly blunt instruments excluding<br>cases at the border<br>case and outbreak management so testing<br>connect tracing<br>and isolation and quarantine and then<br>reducing transmission<br>and there again very limited tools here<br>you can reduce transmission through<br>contact which is about hygiene measures<br>or you can reduce the frequency of<br>contact so physical distancing<br>and so on we actually i should say we we<br>wrote up this approach in the museum<br>medical journal and also now in the<br>medical union of australia<br>so going through those responses i think<br>almost everyone who's lived through<br>the last few months will almost know<br>this strategy anyway<br>that we have um border management<br>initial<br>initially entry restrictions our board<br>has never been closed although<br>there were remarkable days where no one<br>came or<br>arrived in new zealand or left the<br>country no one could remember when that<br>last occurred but it was decades ago<br>but most days we have about 300 people<br>arriving in new zealand on average<br>so you've got these components initially<br>self-isolation then moving to<br>supervised and managed approaches<br>and also extending these practices to<br>aircrew and seaports<br>and as we're finding it's hard to do<br>this at a big scale<br>consistently with no mistakes so that's<br>the challenge we are<br>we're having to manage at the moment and<br>there's a succession of measures here<br>um these are only some of the large ones<br>there's been lots of key dates here<br>where it's been fine-tuned<br>and we have these amazing scenes at<br>airports with virtually no aircraft<br>coming<br>so case in contact management this of<br>course is a a new strategy to build up<br>um it relies initially on really<br>establishing testing for a new pathogen<br>increasing that capacity um having<br>uh assessment places conduct tracing<br>and everything associated with that we<br>still got very limited digital<br>assistance with this<br>and again there was a succession of key<br>dates here as<br>this national capacity was increased<br>and again if you look on the ministry<br>website you'll see a graph like this<br>it's updated but<br>it shows just the the massive scale<br>of this um operation um and<br>certainly new zealand is amongst the at<br>the high end now countries in terms of<br>testing rates so<br>the third strategy about reducing<br>transmission it all comes down to<br>reducing this<br>reproduction number which i guess has<br>become almost a household term now<br>and if you look at the reproduction<br>number<br>it actually is has three components that<br>feed into it<br>so the risk of transmission per contact<br>the contact rate and the duration of<br>infectivity<br>now unfortunately we can't modify this<br>one<br>duration of infectivity at the moment<br>because we need antivirals<br>to do that if you don't have<br>but transmissibility is around physical<br>distancing cough etiquette<br>and mask use hand hygiene and so on<br>uh contact rates is really if you<br>establish if you encourage you're going<br>to go home and stay home home quarantine<br>that's very good at<br>reducing your contact rates and<br>obviously mass gatherings and so on<br>are bad for contact rates so<br>um we again familiar with the alert<br>level sorry this is not really<br>readable but this was actually delivered<br>to everyone in new zealand<br>and i think it was a great risk<br>communication tool which was adapted by<br>similar tools being used<br>overseas and again the entire country<br>became very<br>focused on what alert level we were at<br>understandably because<br>they had huge implications for many of<br>reducing contact uh transmission to a<br>contact<br>again you've got limited range of<br>options here<br>and one that new zealand does not have<br>which is<br>really um puts us out of step now i<br>think with many countries is<br>we don't have a culture of using face<br>masks<br>and sometimes the terms use mass masking<br>or universal masking<br>and this is particularly the use of<br>reusable fabric face masks by the public<br>it's not for instance on any of the<br>posters that were produced in new<br>zealand<br>so we're told hand washed but the<br>limitations of hand washers<br>hand washing is it doesn't really help<br>you much when you're on a bus and<br>someone's just talking with you<br>breathing on you um<br>even worse if they laugh or sing or<br>shout<br>they can invent you in that<br>pre-symptomatic stage<br>so the physical distancing that's the<br>other part of this again this was um<br>very um uh clear to everyone<br>particularly level four that you<br>essentially the whole country put into<br>home quarantine<br>for almost five weeks and even at level<br>three<br>something fairly approaching home<br>quarantine<br>we see we saw these remarkable scenes<br>across our cities<br>for many of us who are fortunate i think<br>most university staff we're very<br>fortunate<br>that working from home is manageable<br>unfortunately<br>it's very tough for many other people<br>but i know getting on my bicycle and<br>cycling around wellington which i<br>do usually regularly was just such a<br>blissful experience minus the motor cars<br>and we saw other various expressions of<br>physical distancing<br>and really this communication to the<br>whole country about<br>what was involved so there's a very busy<br>slide here but it is um<br>just showing that there's a whole<br>sequence of dates but the most dramatic<br>ones of course we're moving into<br>rapidly into level four and that was<br>really the thing that distinguished new<br>zealand's response from<br>many other countries was that we and<br>it's a<br>it's a distinguishing feature of an<br>elimination approach is that you<br>throw maximum activities or resources<br>at containing transmission at the start<br>when we had no we had only 100 cases<br>when the decision was made<br>and no fatalities in that point whereas<br>the influenza plan says you<br>basically increase these controls as a<br>pending it gets worse<br>to flatten the curve excuse me<br>so what was the impact of that well we<br>we don't know the impact of all the<br>components but we can look um with<br>modelling at the effects of the lockdown<br>and we can see<br>that at um alert level four<br>the reproduction number effective<br>reproduction number was under<br>0.5 and that is obviously means that<br>change of transmission<br>on average will peter out and that was<br>compared with the<br>reproduction number before that of<br>almost<br>2.<br>um this is another approach to modeling<br>this this is using i think very clever<br>uh phylogenetic approaches by colleagues<br>at auckland university<br>and this is showing a very similar<br>result that prior to<br>these lockdown measures um each case<br>museum was typically infecting<br>two or more cases so we had a<br>basically that's exponential spread and<br>during the lockdown period the<br>reproduction number again was under<br>0.5 and similar to what was achieved in<br>australia<br>so without elimination strategy there's<br>there's a question of course<br>when what does elimination actually look<br>like<br>i mean how do you know that you've<br>actually got there and uh<br>the this is the definition that we put<br>up and uh we did<br>a lot of scientific blogs during this<br>period and you've got these three<br>elements you've got<br>no detected cases for a period and<br>i think 28 days gives a high level of<br>certainty<br>in the presence of a high performing<br>and also excluding cases that are um<br>not local transmission for example those<br>that are<br>identified at borders and places<br>effective isolation or quarantine<br>and we can see the problem of not um<br>at the moment to the world it looks like<br>new zealand has ongoing transmission<br>because<br>our daily total is including one or two<br>cases at the moment<br>and that's um it's really not<br>particularly sensible to have<br>all of these cases put together because<br>this these do not compromise uh our<br>eliminations<br>and status as long as as long as they<br>stay in<br>effective quarantine of course and not<br>released early to infect people but if<br>they don't infect people museum<br>that doesn't alter our elimination<br>status<br>this is really showing um the<br>different options that countries have<br>and sorry this is a very busy slide<br>but we've got these start choices you've<br>got<br>an exclusion strategy which is adopted<br>by pacific islands and we can see<br>examples samoa and tonga<br>have excluded the virus entirely for<br>good reason<br>and illumination strategy is really what<br>new zealand's doing<br>we followed the example of really<br>mainland china and taiwan<br>they had a lot of experience with sars<br>but this has also been pursued by fiji<br>successfully<br>suppression strategy is that you and<br>this is obviously most of europe<br>and north america i'm not sure how to<br>classify them<br>but this is where you are trying to<br>minimize<br>the number of cases in the community but<br>you're not eliminating the virus<br>mitigation strategy was talked about<br>early on<br>by a number of countries that was based<br>on certain assumptions that turned out<br>not to be very valid<br>i'm not sure if sweden would still<br>describe their approaches and mitigation<br>and unfortunately for some low-income<br>countries<br>there's really no substantive strategy<br>and it's interesting to think the end<br>path here exit path<br>is to emerge as new zealand has into<br>essentially a country that has no<br>ongoing transmission before the benefits<br>come from that<br>i think the difficulty with suppression<br>is that you have ongoing transmission<br>and you may be going in and out of<br>lockdown<br>so i'm not um i haven't done a detailed<br>analysis of the consequences of this i<br>mean we all<br>i guess many of us are looking from time<br>to time<br>at the quite depressing global<br>statistics<br>but when you look at cases that are in<br>this elimination or exclusion group<br>and sorry about the um the very busy<br>slide here<br>but you can see typically these<br>countries have very low<br>mortality rate as expressed as this per<br>million say and<br>obviously you don't want to focus on the<br>details here but the rule of pattern<br>is even in very populous countries<br>like um as we've heard already from uh<br>phillip hill um china has very low<br>immortality just in a very similar range<br>to new zealand and australia and<br>singapore<br>i mean really the world leader is taiwan<br>who did everything right from the<br>beginning and i think<br>we can learn a lot from their experience<br>suppression<br>is uh again has a wide range of um<br>levels of success some countries have<br>suppressed the virus very effectively<br>um other countries it's quite grim if<br>you look at<br>0.15 percent of the population new york<br>has died from this<br>infection and we imagine what that<br>looks like if it's expressed if it's<br>applied to all of the united states<br>they might have half a million<br>fatalities so the pandemic's got a long<br>way to run<br>virtually everywhere there's some<br>estimates that it's only<br>infected maybe five percent of the<br>world's population at this stage so<br>it's got the potential to cause 20 to 30<br>million deaths<br>globally i'm not sure for any countries<br>that are really in a mitigation approach<br>but the swedish example here has<br>not been successful<br>so what are the ongoing challenges going<br>ahead<br>um we've got threats to elimination in<br>new zealand obviously failures border<br>management we've got<br>increasing transmission in winter and<br>problems with resuming large indoor<br>social gatherings<br>i mean this is the calculated risk of<br>staying in level one<br>wider health threats that we've heard<br>about the indirect<br>health effects of the response<br>increasing economic hardship and<br>inequalities and some of the multiple<br>global health consequences of this<br>ongoing pandemic<br>so what do we have to do to maintain our<br>status well i guess<br>obviously care for water management we<br>think we need a culture of face mask use<br>at the very least we think all new<br>zealanders should<br>have a reusable face mask and know how<br>to use it if needed<br>and there's some really clever<br>technology which can improve<br>um conduct tracing and we advocate very<br>strongly for a rapid review of our<br>progress so far an establishment of a<br>dedicated national public health agency<br>uh to manage the response going ahead<br>and unfortunately the simpson<br>report the review of the health and<br>disability<br>system says virtually nothing about<br>health protection<br>it's just it doesn't pass the coded test<br>and even regardless of that it really<br>has virtually nothing on<br>i would say many population health goals<br>it's really about reforming<br>the health care system and that's good<br>but we need a separate focus on this<br>area so these are some of the main<br>points um<br>from this i think in lessons that we we<br>really need a very effective risk<br>assessment in strategic decision making<br>in public health crises i think the<br>combination of good science and good<br>leadership is really<br>vital and i think there's a strong<br>message i think for the whole country<br>would have seen how we need to<br>increase or invest in our public health<br>infrastructure<br>and also at a global level to reform the<br>world health organization<br>and hopefully there's an opportunity for<br>because the uh the kind of approaches<br>used in this pandemic can hopefully be<br>applied to<br>the many other global health threats<br>that are already upon us particularly<br>related to climate change<br>so one of the truisms of public health<br>is that um<br>uh if everything goes perfect perfectly<br>no one notices and um this is a cartoon<br>i was sent<br>but how will we know if our pandemic<br>guidelines work<br>the world will think we overreacted and<br>i think we all experience versions of<br>this when we've discussed<br>the pandemic and what to do about it<br>thank you professor michael baker we do<br>have a few questions<br>and i will read them in the order that<br>they came in<br>firstly could you talk about testing<br>technology<br>and any likely advancements that we<br>might expect here for example saliva<br>tests<br>yeah i'm probably the wrong person to<br>ask about that<br>but um certainly um the the thing that's<br>really impressed me<br>is the speed with which our laboratory<br>scientists have all<br>got together and really pulled together<br>a remarkable<br>increase in capacity across the country<br>and<br>that i think has just been vital to the<br>response<br>i know going ahead there's a huge number<br>of<br>different testing technologies that<br>people are working on including<br>our scientists at otago and<br>they do offer rapid you know rapid<br>testing is um<br>there's a whole rapid testing<br>technologies that are being looked at<br>at the moment i think we still very much<br>with the uh using the standard pcr<br>methods that do have<br>um you know the highly sensitive if the<br>right specimen is collected<br>um that's obviously limitation but uh<br>and they do take some time so i know<br>there's<br>thank you next question what is your<br>confidence in new zealand's current<br>well i think the core elements are very<br>good i mean<br>that's basically about information<br>systems protocols<br>um a trained workforce and and<br>experience with doing this and one of<br>the interesting things now of course is<br>that<br>this system is i mean it's in theory got<br>the capacity to<br>follow up up to a thousand cases a day<br>which is<br>pretty remarkable so it hasn't really<br>been if you like um<br>tested rigorously yet that's certainly<br>not at that scale<br>but i understand they are doing<br>exercises to simulate<br>what would happen if there was an<br>outbreak and we'll need to keep doing<br>that because<br>the hope is we don't have any cases or<br>outbreaks in the community in new<br>zealand<br>next one um why did you say you're not<br>sure how to categorize the americas with<br>well obviously um the united states i<br>don't even know if you call that a<br>suppression strategy there when<br>um they're opening up the country very<br>early<br>and if you have widespread cases in a<br>population<br>and you lift the constraints on physical<br>distancing<br>you appear to actively discourage mask<br>use then that's a complete disaster<br>and all of those cases you've got in the<br>community will all start<br>outbreaks with a very high reproduction<br>number<br>and one of my colleagues does a lot of<br>modeling for the across the globe<br>and he sends me these analyses which<br>right down to the state level in the us<br>and it really is very disturbing because<br>you know what will happen<br>in one or two incubation periods from<br>now<br>there will be these explosive outbreaks<br>and all those states<br>that are not following basic measures so<br>thank you you mentioned that rtro's<br>approach<br>changed from a mitigation to an<br>elimination strategy sharply<br>on march 23rd do you have an opinion on<br>why the approach changed so sharply<br>and why at that point uh<br>well this will be something that will be<br>analyzed<br>in fine detail i'm sure in the future<br>there was a cabinet covered committee<br>that was i think making the final call<br>and that's the i mean that's why i think<br>we have politicians because they have to<br>make these uh the kind of decisions that<br>are very tough<br>to make because the idea of shutting<br>down essentially the whole country<br>is very tough and you know it's going to<br>hurt people and people<br>lose their jobs and so on but at the<br>same time<br>you're balancing against public health<br>and i think that's a real tribute to our<br>government<br>that they put they prioritize public<br>health but actually it's it's be a false<br>dichotomy to say one or the other<br>because i think they do go hand in hand<br>i think<br>our government did recognize that i mean<br>obviously there were people public<br>health people like myself<br>that um switched to saying we<br>absolutely have to follow this<br>elimination path and we're saying very<br>publicly<br>in the days before then and<br>interestingly the business leaders in<br>new zealand were also saying that<br>and that's because many of them had<br>operations overseas and they could just<br>see<br>how gruesome things were becoming<br>and they had i think a lifeboat new<br>zealand viewpoint that we had to save<br>the country and they thought that was<br>the most<br>uh viable approach um because after all<br>it's the least bad option and this is a<br>whole realm of counterfactuals<br>when people say oh elimination is really<br>tough of course it's tough<br>but you have to say what is your<br>alternative and i think was that<br>realization<br>the alternatives were much worse than<br>our next question um says elimination is<br>a great achievement<br>what are the implications if source<br>coverage ii continues to be endemic<br>elsewhere in the world which seems<br>likely and available vaccines are only<br>moderately effective<br>and or uptake is modest<br>yeah look that's a great question<br>because we just don't know about the<br>duration of immunity there are many<br>unknowns but at least new zealand<br>is in a position to make an informed<br>choice hopefully<br>and in the form and the time that we can<br>choose<br>so in other words we're now in control<br>of the pandemic in this country we're<br>not having to trail after it<br>and i think that's a really good<br>position to be in and also i think<br>the other therapeutic options may be<br>very good antivirals which could turn<br>this into a treatable<br>form of pneumonia as is the case for<br>many forms of pneumonia we don't have<br>vaccines<br>against many infectious diseases but we<br>manage them with<br>antibacterials and antivirals so i think<br>they're the other options that will also<br>help thank you<br>what should air new zealand be doing<br>re-international aircrew<br>i.e should they be traveling home on<br>domestic flights directly following an<br>international flight<br>well yeah i i agree there's lots of um<br>concerns about air crews and also at<br>seaports<br>that we have to play all these potential<br>holes and<br>i always think the that anyone who<br>thinks<br>um is proposing an alternative to 14<br>days quarantine<br>in a supervised facility needs to<br>explain why<br>what they're proposing is giving an<br>equivalent level of protection for new<br>zealand<br>i think it is possible to do things that<br>work as well<br>but i think these these business<br>enterprises like in new zealand<br>need to justify that it will achieve a<br>similar level<br>and is there any point in history that<br>herd immunity has actually worked<br>well yes for many infectious diseases<br>that's all we had<br>before we had vaccines we had heard<br>immunity for many things<br>i mean you think of all the the<br>infectious disease the childhood measles<br>mumps from bala<br>that's how people gain protection um<br>but the price was that many children<br>died and of course<br>indigenous populations who were exposed<br>to these infections as adults<br>they were particularly lethal i mean<br>needles and smallpox basically<br>killed almost everyone in the new world<br>at different times<br>historically so that's what<br>the scenario we've got with this new<br>with every emerging infectious disease<br>do you believe that the government is<br>doing enough to monitor the impacts of<br>covered 19 on non-covered 19 related<br>no um but i i think there's a huge<br>awareness<br>of these other consequences i just look<br>at um i know some of my colleagues<br>working on cancer control<br>are very concerned about delays in<br>routine screening and so on so<br>i'd say there's a higher level of<br>awareness about these consequences<br>but i don't think we we can quantify all<br>of these consequences but that is an<br>important priority i think<br>right the phrase whole of government<br>response has come up a lot in the<br>discussion about international responses<br>does that help explain different<br>approaches or different outcomes of the<br>same approaches<br>applied in different countries or other<br>no i think um and i've been talking with<br>my colleagues in lots of<br>um jurisdictions over seeds and<br>um i think in the western world there's<br>been a terrible failure of risk<br>assessment<br>and risk management with this pandemic<br>and<br>to quote i think the editor of the<br>lancet he<br>described this as complacent<br>exceptionalism<br>but somehow the western world our<br>science agencies over there<br>sat watched the pandemic coming out of<br>china<br>and said we'll just treat this like<br>influenza<br>almost imagining that it would not be<br>particularly severe<br>and i think that's quite a shocking<br>error of judgment and i know in new<br>zealand we were looking for leadership<br>from<br>the world health organization cdc in the<br>us public health england<br>european center for disease control and<br>i<br>think the advice was poor i mean the who<br>was saying<br>keep your borders open and um don't<br>use face masks as a population strategy<br>until very recently<br>so i think that they were really<br>problematic advice we got<br>and i think new zealand really made the<br>right decision at the very last moment<br>just as a pandemic was switching from<br>being predominantly<br>what should be the criteria for relaxing<br>water closures if the virus remains<br>well i think one of the positives is<br>that many countries in the eastern<br>hemisphere<br>are doing what new zealand's doing<br>you've got in china 1.4 billion people<br>largely protected<br>i mean they will get the occasional<br>outbreak taiwan 23 million people<br>under 10 deaths you've now got<br>even vietnam and mongolia have largely<br>prevented<br>fatalities from this uh and so you've<br>got a lot of other countries that we can<br>start to interact with our latino<br>largest<br>markets china and australia<br>are largely free of this virus so i<br>think there's a very optimistic<br>future for countries pursuing<br>elimination<br>and we won't have to just stay sitting<br>in new zealand<br>uh long term i think there will be<br>potential for<br>even quarantine free travel at some<br>point<br>fiji's prime minister named you as an<br>advisor to the fiji health authorities<br>as he relaxed restrictions in fiji last<br>night<br>what are your thoughts on the adoption<br>of the bula bubble concept<br>which appears to be used in more<br>economic than a health context<br>yes well i think fiji has done a<br>fantastic job<br>and i mean they've uh unlike some of the<br>other pacific islands they did get<br>cases and then they stamped them out so<br>they are very much on on power of new<br>zealand they've done an elimination<br>strategy<br>arguably arguably they've done better<br>they've had no fatalities<br>so i'm actually very wary of making<br>comparisons between countries<br>based on um just um you know these very<br>crude metrics<br>but certainly i think we should<br>congratulate them on that<br>and i think we should do everything we<br>can to establish<br>travel links lengths maybe fiji will<br>take a bit longer but certainly<br>pacific countries that have entirely<br>excluded this virus there can't be any<br>i don't know why we don't have open<br>travel now with cook islands<br>and we've got time for one last question<br>um does the new zealand healthcare<br>system<br>and western health systems in general<br>need to reorient itself<br>to management of communicable versus<br>ncds a major problem at the hospital<br>level was a lack of building design for<br>infection control<br>for example yeah i think it's a very<br>good point that<br>overall the burden of infectious<br>diseases has declined steadily and i<br>think that's a huge<br>tribute to public health largely better<br>water<br>or cleaner water and food and<br>immunization and so on<br>but we the evidence now is that there<br>are a glowing growing number of<br>infectious disease<br>threats not just from pandemic<br>infections but also by<br>bioengineered threats and antimicrobial<br>resistance so<br>i think we unfortunately we've got two<br>major threats ncds and infectious<br>diseases<br>we have to basically manage both of them<br>going ahead<br>and i think it is a pity that the health<br>and disability system<br>review which was a huge undertaking<br>really doesn't have<br>anything in it for managing these<br>threats so i think that's um<br>that's something that me will need a<br>separate agency i believe to take it<br>take it forward thank you professor<br>michael bacon and unfortunately we're<br>out of time<br>on our webinar school today but i hope<br>everybody will join us again from 12 p.m<br>we will be here from 12 p.m<br>to office one tomorrow<br>and also of course live streaming on<br>facebook thanks very much everyone<br>yamihi</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
