day two of the covert 19<br>master class<br>i'm jackie haringer manager of the otago<br>global health institute<br>augie for short just a reminder that the<br>master class webinars are being recorded<br>and will be available on the augie<br>website later we're also live streaming<br>through the ogi facebook page<br>during the webinars each speaker will<br>deliver their presentation and you can<br>ask questions at any time<br>through the q a function at the bottom<br>of your screen<br>after the presentation i'll read the<br>questions aloud for the speaker to reply<br>we have quite a tight schedule for our<br>webinars so if we're not able to get to<br>all the questions during this session<br>we'll ask our speakers to provide<br>written responses and we'll post those<br>also<br>on the ogi website our first speaker<br>this morning<br>dr nolan hung my apologies<br>is an anatomical pathologist with<br>sub-specialist interest in perinatal<br>pathology<br>her topic is the performance and<br>pathological findings<br>of covert 19 positive autopsy<br>thank you thank you jackie thank you for<br>i've only got 30 minutes so i won't be<br>doing a lot of background work i just<br>want to give you<br>as much as i think we know about covert<br>19 from<br>autopsy studies please feel free to ask<br>questions afterwards so if i can if i've<br>missed anything out<br>so i'm from the department of pathology<br>i'm a bit of a rare breed now<br>anatomic pathologists are sort of dying<br>out<br>as we get older and younger ones aren't<br>being trained anymore<br>but by the same token autopsy rates are<br>also decreasing so maybe our<br>skills are not that needed anymore<br>but my first slide is a summary of all<br>the<br>reports i can find of autopsy in the<br>literature<br>and some of these are still in pre-print<br>form they're not even published and i<br>apologize in advance if i've missed<br>anything out<br>but the first few cases<br>were reported in february of this year<br>and then a few more in march and now by<br>the end of may we have about 95 cases<br>reported which isn't a lot<br>uh for when you consider that there are<br>half a million people who have died<br>and that the whole of western medicine<br>really has been based on clinical<br>pathological correlation between<br>what's found in autopsy and what is<br>found<br>from clinical symptoms and signs and<br>studies during life<br>the biggest study is now this italian<br>one that came out at the end of<br>may looking at lung autopsies in<br>particular<br>very little on the rest of the body and<br>in fact some of these autopsy cases are<br>only core biopsies taken<br>from the lung at death and my own<br>philosophy is that we<br>as a profession should be right in here<br>getting as many answers as we can for<br>everyone<br>but i know there's been a lot of<br>reluctance about perhaps contacting<br>covert 19 while we're doing the autopsy<br>it is an invasive procedure no<br>no doubt but our own experience here we<br>use<br>universal precautions in our own<br>facility and perhaps the only extra<br>thing we did<br>was to keep the number of people<br>involved down to the<br>absolute limit and we divided our<br>mortuary in half and we had<br>technical staff on one side i was<br>performing the autopsy on the other and<br>we tried to keep things as<br>clear and low<br>personnel involved as possible<br>subsequently none of us have contacted<br>covert 19 by the way<br>but anyway this is what my talk is based<br>on my own experience with the covert 19<br>case<br>and with these cases published in the<br>literature i will dive<br>quite quickly into the pathology and i<br>apologize in advance<br>some of you aren't used to looking at um<br>well what i call pretty pictures of<br>disease but<br>i'll try and guide you through them as<br>much as i can<br>so the talk will cover the pulmonary<br>findings obviously and they're some of<br>the most important and this primarily<br>involves<br>diffuse alveolar damage which is<br>a lesion that pathologists have known<br>about and of course clinical people too<br>have known about for a long time<br>in fact it's sort of a blast from the<br>past for me because as a<br>sub-specialized perinatal pathologist<br>this was the lesion that was found in<br>premature babies and um lead them on to<br>bronchopulmonary dysplasia thankfully we<br>don't see that very often now<br>so it's um it's a lesion we're familiar<br>with<br>it has three stages and i'll show you<br>some photos of those the acute and<br>organizing<br>and eventually the end stage which was<br>the bronchocombinary dysplasia that<br>caused so many<br>pulmonary problems and these premature<br>babies<br>this newer finding in terms of covert 19<br>at least which is thrombosis<br>and then some of the smaller findings of<br>acute bronchopneumonia and bronchiolitis<br>obliterans<br>i'll mention some of these other organs<br>and what we've found in there<br>what i won't be talking about is the<br>brain findings because as far as i can<br>tell no one's actually looked inside a<br>brain<br>at autopsy of a carbon 19 positive<br>patient and there are good reasons for<br>that and the reason why<br>we ourselves didn't look in and that is<br>that there's quite a lot of aerosol<br>generated<br>with the sores going through the cranium<br>and i think we decided that<br>just one step too far clinically though<br>there have been some reports of<br>infarction type problems developing<br>and i think we can link that back to the<br>thrombosis and<br>finally what i'm not talking about is<br>kawasaki-like syndrome<br>this is the pediatric symptoms and signs<br>that have been found<br>in association with copit19 to my<br>delight it<br>probably means that we have a maybe a<br>reason for kawasaki disease that we've<br>never had before maybe it is a viral<br>coronavirus type lesion but i've seen no<br>autopsy reports about it and so i won't<br>address it in this talk<br>so this is what the clinical people are<br>used to seeing now<br>from their ct and in mr scans<br>a very patchy process through the lungs<br>of these opacities<br>which are the disease process you can<br>see it's very<br>patchy and in fact our term diffuse is<br>probably not a good term in that respect<br>because it is patchy and it's not<br>diffusely through<br>if we were to look at this<br>just on a histological section or<br>histopathological section so<br>pathologists spend a lot of time looking<br>down the microscope<br>in the dark they would say but we're<br>looking at these<br>actual sections of tissue where you can<br>see the lung alveolus scepter here this<br>is not with any magnification apart from<br>putting it up on the screen and it's an<br>h e<br>section which is why it's pink and a bit<br>of purple you can see that there are a<br>lot of<br>normal areas here and then these filled<br>in the areas that are the diseased<br>areas this correlates with the ct<br>findings in particular<br>i'll come back to this red thing in a<br>minute<br>so that's sort of the low power look<br>this is probably the very first stages<br>that we understand are happening in<br>covet 19<br>and the reason why we're calling it<br>diffuse alveolar damage<br>i may say that diffuse alveolar damage<br>is seen in a with a lot of causes not<br>just<br>a lot of etiologies not just covert 19<br>and results in the ards the acute<br>respiratory distress syndrome<br>in a lot of cases so this is one of the<br>first stages these are the alveolar<br>septic sort of collapsed<br>autopsy pathologists are used to seeing<br>this because it's part of the<br>degeneration that happens quite quickly<br>after death<br>and these spaces here where they should<br>be filled with air<br>like here are filled with a fluid now<br>and as we understand it there is an<br>insult to probably both the endothelium<br>that is in the capillaries and these<br>alveolarcepti<br>and the lining cells of the alveolar<br>themselves alveoli<br>themselves the type 1 pneumocytes<br>and i think every cause of diffuse<br>alveolar damage may have a slightly<br>different emphasis but<br>both of those cells are involved and i<br>think it's a good<br>thing to think about the alveolar septum<br>as being this complex<br>of an interstitial space that's got<br>maybe a few<br>fibroblasts in it connective tissue type<br>cells capillaries<br>running through it lined by endothelial<br>cells and<br>the alveolar septum with a basement<br>membrane<br>and then the type 1 pneumocytes<br>predominantly lining there<br>and both the endothelial cells and the<br>pneumocytes<br>seem to be damaged in a way that allows<br>this fluid<br>to leak out of the capillaries and into<br>the<br>alveolar spaces along with this comes<br>some congestion which i'll show you on<br>our next<br>slide so this is a postmortem<br>photomicrograph as well and it's showing<br>the highline membranes which we believe<br>develop from that<br>fluid that's leaked into the alveolar<br>septum maybe a bit of air gets in there<br>sort of pushes it to the side<br>and we have widening of that alveolar<br>septal complex by this proteinaceous and<br>cellular debris which gets pushed up<br>along the alveolarcepting you can see<br>them here<br>we call them hyaline because they look<br>sort of glassy and pink there's<br>no cellular structure to them as such<br>and then in the background<br>these capillaries septi are dilated and<br>congested that's part of the<br>probably what leads to that exudation<br>and this is often called<br>the exudative phase and then in the<br>background too you can see<br>some nuclei here these are predominantly<br>lymphocytes<br>maybe the odd neutrophil and at this<br>stage we don't have any real widening of<br>the alveolarceptic<br>although that's starting to occur here<br>and there's probably even some<br>influx now with some connective tissue<br>cells fibroblast cells<br>type cells which are the start of<br>healing probably from day two to three<br>onwards<br>it's nothing new that's what healing is<br>all about and<br>typical of diffuse alveolar damage so<br>this was our case in some areas<br>had this early stages still a diffuser<br>damage<br>so as time progresses we know that the<br>highline membranes may be cleared away a<br>little bit more this is a<br>case one of those early ones that was<br>reported<br>they were particularly interested in the<br>highline membranes you can see there's a<br>few<br>lining these alveoli there's a good one<br>in particular<br>and a few inflammatory cells scattered<br>through here<br>perhaps some alveolar macrophages in the<br>middle here<br>we often see these these are resident<br>macrophages of the alveolar septic<br>alveolar spaces they seem to get a bit<br>more intense<br>as diffuser damage progresses<br>and in this paper they're looking for<br>any effects of the virus itself so<br>viruses have a morphological effect on<br>tissue cells and we can often diagnose<br>that<br>virus because of the morphological<br>effect because it's a typical effect<br>in the case of covert 19 i don't think<br>anyone's definitively shown a cytopathic<br>effect in terms of inclusions<br>but there's certainly quite a lot of<br>cleomorphism and sort of reactive<br>changes<br>from the alveolar macrophages and<br>probably<br>the type ii pneumocytes that are now<br>proliferating as part of that healing<br>response<br>and we're getting from the exudative<br>phase into<br>the more proliferative phase of diffuse<br>this is another photo from that sorry<br>from the same group zoo one of the<br>early publications again looking for<br>that viral cytoplasmy<br>and showing the amount of material in<br>the alveolar septic<br>and inflammatory cells there's a few<br>hyaline membranes remaining down the<br>bottom right there<br>this is our case again going back to the<br>more opaque areas<br>the more trends areas that don't have a<br>lot of aeration to them<br>and we can see now we've got more<br>alveolar macrophages in here we've got<br>more type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and<br>more inflammatory infiltration<br>of the lymphocyte type this is another<br>this is a<br>vessel that's been thrombosed i'll come<br>back to that in a minute<br>so these are some of the special<br>investigations that we can do to<br>highlight and confirm<br>the findings that we identify<br>morphologically<br>this is an h e there's an alveolar<br>space here that's full filled with<br>macrophages there are type 2 pneumocytes<br>proliferating along this alveolar septum<br>they're the repair cells if you like<br>and they're highlighted here by a<br>keratin stain which is<br>typical for epithelial cells and what it<br>does show by its negative staining is<br>the widening now<br>of the alveolar septic so you can see<br>how wide this<br>diffusion space is becoming it's hard to<br>pick it out in here but there's actually<br>a<br>albeolus septum that goes from say these<br>lining cells here right across to this<br>side now and there are some<br>congested capillaries so the whole<br>diffusion distance has increased<br>enormously even if<br>we're getting lots of air into these<br>alveolar<br>spaces they seem to be filled up with<br>cells now<br>so this is a i mean it has to chemical<br>stain called a cam 5.2 just a<br>pan keratin and shows up those lining<br>cells nicely<br>this is another one of those cells<br>immunohistochemical stains that brings<br>up<br>surfactant-producing cells so this is<br>called ttf1<br>and it shows the proliferation of these<br>repair type cells type 2 pneumocytes<br>producing more<br>surfactant and lining the alveolarcepti<br>and then this is a cd68 normally i don't<br>like cd68 because it's a bit of a<br>messy stain but it highlights in this<br>case in particular<br>the alveolar macrophages so you can see<br>how many alveolar macrophages now are<br>filling those<br>alveolar spaces really should be air<br>so we're now into the proliferative<br>stage of diffuse alveolar<br>damage and this stage correlates we<br>believe with the stage now clinical<br>deterioration where they're starting to<br>require<br>in terms of the immune response in this<br>lesion<br>this is from our case which we source<br>quite a few lymphocytic aggregates not a<br>huge<br>number but certainly more than you would<br>expect in a normal lung<br>this is just the h and e showing all<br>these dot like lymphocytes infiltrating<br>i can't tell you whether they're b or t<br>cells at this stage<br>and that's why i do i mean i have<br>immunohistochemistry<br>this is a cd20 antibody that picks up<br>the b<br>cells you can see there's quite a few b<br>cells this is in a similar area just<br>further cut into the tissue and then<br>this is a cd<br>um 3 which is or cd4 which is<br>a big part this is cd4 this is cd8 so<br>this is highlighting the um<br>t cells oh i got that right yes i have<br>so this is the cd4<br>highlighting the t cells and this is the<br>cd8<br>t cells um the rest of the cells in here<br>are b cells would be cd20<br>and there weren't actually too many of<br>those they were mostly t cells<br>in these aggregates now one other<br>stain that i haven't seen used in the<br>literature yet is a cd138<br>and this antibody picks up plasma cells<br>and i was interested to know whether or<br>not<br>plasma cells were producing a lot of<br>antibody at the time of this<br>patient's teeth and really there were<br>only a few<br>plasma cells scattered through and the<br>cd138 has another name which is some<br>deacon one<br>which is an interesting cytokine<br>expressed on some of the<br>pneumocytes and you can see the<br>cytoplasmic and membrane staining<br>on some of these type 2 pneumocytes up<br>here it's a much more diffused sort of<br>lighter staining<br>than on plasma cells but<br>whether or not that's pro-inflammatory<br>or anti-inflammatory at that stage<br>i can't tell you i can just tell you<br>it's there<br>um oops right so if i can go back to<br>let's see sorry i've<br>gone too fast if i go back to this<br>initial low power sort of view of the<br>lung tissue that i showed you i pointed<br>out that there was this big red thing<br>this is a thrombus<br>sitting within a small artery of the<br>lung<br>you can see it's occluding the artery<br>and i think that is why this person died<br>quite often with diffuse alveolar damage<br>we can find patients who have<br>thrombosis associated with it it's not<br>uncommon<br>but i think it took the clinical<br>community at least a while to<br>recognize this was happening i think ct<br>scans may have missed a lot of them<br>because they're in such small vessels<br>but certainly there's also cases where<br>we've had big pulmonary emboli develop<br>in a few cases as well<br>so there seems to be a hyper<br>coagulability<br>problem in these code in 19 cases from<br>the literature i'd say at least a third<br>to<br>even a half of patients who have died<br>have had thrombosis in some place most<br>typically<br>the lungs as we saw in our case so this<br>is um a gross photo looking at the lungs<br>in our case this is the pulmonary hilum<br>which in fact is showing a this is a<br>pulmonary lymph node this<br>our patient was a smoker so there's lots<br>of anthroconic pigment in there<br>the airways have some mucoid material in<br>them which is typically<br>seen in in the diffusive healer damage<br>case and particularly in covid19<br>but there was no pulmonary thrombosis<br>this is an artery here that looked like<br>it was a deep vein thrombosis that had<br>resulted in a pulmonary embolus<br>the emboli that we saw or at least the<br>thrombosis that we saw<br>was typically just throughout diffusely<br>throughout all the lung<br>small vessels so this is just cut<br>section there's a thrombus sitting in a<br>small vessel there one there one there<br>in fact all these yellow<br>arrows are pointing to just massive<br>diffuse thrombosis through this lung<br>and i think that that's why this person<br>died um he also<br>died with um no<br>systolic activity pumping activity from<br>the heart which is typical of a<br>massive thrombosis type picture in the<br>lungs<br>when we look at it histopathologically<br>this is the hme section this is in one<br>of the more normal looking areas we've<br>got lots of air coming into here<br>but you can see the vascular<br>space is blocked now by the thrombosis<br>in here and these are special stains<br>just confirming that this is indeed a<br>thrombosis and not just postmortem<br>coagulation and<br>this and now we had an area<br>which had a sort of an acute pneumonia<br>these are neutrophils<br>um was just in one small area but i<br>understand that other<br>cases have also found a small area of<br>bronchopneumonia<br>type picture what this means overall<br>i i'm not sure just that it's there and<br>um<br>may have contributed to his death in<br>terms of his senses<br>um some people are reporting a little<br>bit of bronchiolitis obliterans<br>this is also an old lesion where the old<br>lesion in terms of what pathologists<br>know about<br>where the alveolar space is filled by<br>sort of granulation tissue which slowly<br>organizes and resolves<br>with time and indicative of an old<br>one report has talked about what i would<br>call corporate amalasia little lumpy<br>bits<br>of acellular material in the lungs i<br>think this is a non-specific finding<br>i've seen it in other lungs<br>i don't think it has anything much to do<br>with covert 19.<br>so that's the lung pathology in the last<br>five minutes which i am allowed right<br>i just wanted to briefly touch on the<br>other organs because at least with our<br>autopsy<br>experience which is i might say probably<br>the highest in the world considering<br>new zealand's only had 22 um cases and<br>we've managed to autopsy one<br>compared to the rest of world with maybe<br>100 cases and<br>500 000 deaths<br>if you look at the ace2 receptor which<br>is<br>the receptor as i understand it for this<br>virus to get into tissue you can see<br>the is actually really high in the gut<br>colon duodenum coming down to the kidney<br>testis<br>and the lung is way down here in terms<br>of its ace2 receptors<br>and so i went through all the other<br>tissues looking to see if there was any<br>effect of<br>any viral effect in these other tissues<br>the heart there have been some clinical<br>findings and<br>in our case we certainly didn't find<br>anything maybe a bit of lycophushkin<br>which is<br>indicative of 70 years and<br>being 70 years old we found some<br>steatosis this is fatty change in the<br>liver not<br>particularly prominent and certainly<br>non-specific<br>and the kidneys we couldn't find any<br>thrombosis<br>and certainly no evidence of a<br>glomerulonephropathy<br>although there is one autopsy series of<br>core biopsies from the kidney<br>where they talk about a lot of proximal<br>tubule changes<br>even looking at their pictures i might<br>suggest that<br>that's autopsy change because as people<br>get old uh<br>degenerate after death the proximal<br>jupiter is one of the first<br>to show degenerative changes so i'm not<br>sure i believe those are covert 19<br>associated effects although that's where<br>the virus has been most<br>consistently reported other people have<br>talked about<br>inflammation in the heart this is a<br>pericardium with some<br>lymphocytic infiltration some vacuolar<br>changes reported in one heart<br>and also the same steatosis type changes<br>in the liver reported<br>and they did think they found a little<br>bit of at least congested<br>capillaries in the kidney<br>the other case in this paper had a one<br>patient with an extremely large heart<br>one<br>one thousand grams a kilo that's a very<br>heavy heart and i'd suggest that's a<br>cardiomyopathy in its own right<br>and they looked at these sort of changes<br>in the heart<br>um a little bit of inflammation and then<br>in the testes they found thrombosis<br>here's another case where they would<br>have noticed that the<br>white matter pulp of the spleen looks<br>reduced<br>now that's a pretty subjective finding<br>but interesting in terms of the immune<br>system<br>in our case at least we found we looked<br>at bone marrow lymph nodes we couldn't<br>um identify any abnormalities then when<br>i say we i mean this is a case has also<br>been reviewed particularly with my<br>colleague<br>lynn wakefield we looked at pancreas<br>thyroid parathyroid gi<br>tract despite the high levels of ace2<br>receptors and could find<br>no lesions and in fact our gut was<br>actually well preserved<br>considering it was an autopsy specimen<br>adrenal skeletal muscle also and the<br>brain as i say we didn't examine the<br>brain<br>but clinically there could be some<br>infarcts from<br>thrombosis type events happening<br>this is a summary of what i see in<br>covert 19<br>autopsies the diffuse alveolar damage<br>which manifests clinically at least as<br>an ards<br>in the cases particularly that die<br>there does seem to be a thrombosis or<br>hypercoagulability happening<br>and this may be disseminated or focal<br>correlates well with the d<br>diamond levels reported clinically and<br>their prognostic significance<br>in the skin there's been sort of a rash<br>reported that probably relates to this<br>and in large vessels at least possibly<br>the brain<br>maybe the kidney and there is one report<br>of prostate<br>thrombosis occurring and the case i've<br>just shown you with testus thrombosis<br>perhaps there's a cardiac pathology<br>happening that's a myocarditis<br>we did do troponin t levels in our case<br>and they were elevated<br>not remarkably but at least<br>histopathologically we didn't find any<br>changes<br>and perhaps there is something happening<br>in the spleen in terms of the white<br>matter<br>density now i shouldn't finish the<br>autopsy findings without mentioning that<br>there are a lot of comorbidities<br>in the cases that have died and whether<br>or not this is related to ace2 receptors<br>that's<br>fascinating in terms of the<br>cardiovascular function<br>our case certainly had some<br>atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries<br>but otherwise was fairly clear of<br>hypertension but had<br>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>and i should have mentioned that and<br>here that's one<br>missing fact i might take the liberty of<br>um<br>fixing that in my final slide that's put<br>up is adding in the chronic obstructive<br>pulmonary disease so i might stop there<br>that's<br>really um as much as i think i should<br>speak to and i'd<br>be very happy to answer any questions<br>thank you nolan i'm a little bit<br>concerned that we may have a technical<br>problem here because<br>i haven't actually received any<br>questions that have come through so<br>either everyone is digesting and<br>absorbing what you've said and thinking<br>about<br>what they may comment or we could have a<br>small technical problem here<br>um i did get one comment that came<br>through just wanting me to confirm<br>the length of the session um today's<br>webinar does go until half past one just<br>to confirm that<br>and uh again i've had someone who's done<br>a testing question so yeah they are<br>coming through<br>but no no i think you blew them away no<br>dude<br>i apologize in advance feel free to<br>email me if i confused you<br>well if there's anything else known that<br>you may want to go through a little bit<br>more detail because i know before we<br>started<br>um you did say you had quite a lot of<br>slides and you were worried about your<br>first time<br>yes i was worried that i'd spend two<br>times too much time speaking to these<br>slides<br>um so there may be time to go into<br>something more detailed<br>yes i guess the the main thing i wanted<br>to<br>um educate everyone about was this<br>diffuser damage in the lungs<br>this does seem to be one of the critical<br>factors leading to death and covert 19<br>and i think understanding the<br>relationship between these ace2<br>receptors<br>virus entry hypertension cardiovascular<br>disease<br>would be an amazing advance for<br>researchers to look into<br>i must say that in february i went off<br>my own<br>ace inhibitor anticipating that i might<br>have to do a covered<br>19 case and knowing that hypertensives<br>were highly featured in the death rate<br>i've since gone back on it because i've<br>i don't know if anybody knows about the<br>ac2 receptor levels but i understand<br>that taking an inhibitor<br>leads to upregulation of the ac2<br>receptors especially in the lung<br>and whether or not that makes people<br>more susceptible to more viral load<br>i don't know i'd be fascinated to learn<br>about this aspect of<br>code 19.<br>questions are coming through thick and<br>fast now i've had one from one of the<br>attendees in the room<br>i'm asking whether there are any<br>therapies that could perhaps be pursued<br>based on your pathological findings<br>yes so um the ace inhibitors for a start<br>whether or not<br>they play a role in this diffuse<br>alveolar damage<br>i don't think we understand a lot about<br>the<br>angiotensin-converting enzyme system in<br>the lung<br>certainly it's advanced a long time a<br>long way since i was at medical school<br>but just understanding what's happening<br>to the ace2 receptors and these<br>diffuse alveolar damage cases i think<br>would be interesting<br>i imagine there i honestly don't know i<br>shouldn't speculate<br>i love coming up with theories but of<br>course there are any theories but um<br>i've stopped on this slide i should<br>really stop on<br>actually maybe one of these slides here<br>because the other aspect too is what's<br>causing the thrombosis<br>i don't think it's an antibody mediated<br>hypercoagulability because i just can't<br>find a lot of<br>plasma cells there but is it a<br>enzyme-mediated plasminogen perhaps<br>mediated hypercurricular ability<br>i don't know it'll be good to be able to<br>address that because i think<br>with at least up to half of cases having<br>a thrombotic event at the<br>end stage i think it's worthwhile<br>pursuing some therapy for that<br>okay i think we have about 30 seconds<br>and we have three questions we'll see we<br>can get through<br>um first one would you be able to make<br>some comment on the possibility of<br>permanent disability in survivors<br>oh yes well whether or not the<br>bronchopulmonary dysplasia type features<br>will end up being in these lungs as a<br>fascinating question<br>i think with the repair process there<br>will be ongoing<br>lung problems of course we're not far<br>enough into the covert<br>pandemic to understand those yet but i<br>think by the end of the year perhaps<br>we'll have some and some information on<br>that<br>thank you nolan and i'm afraid we're out<br>of time so any questions we didn't get<br>to we will certainly email and uh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
