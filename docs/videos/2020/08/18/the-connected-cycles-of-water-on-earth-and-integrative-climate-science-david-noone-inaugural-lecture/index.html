Water is at the heart of many of the most complex problems in climate sciences: understanding the behaviour of clouds in a warmer world, how land ecosystems mediate evolving rainfall patterns, and when weather patterns trigger decline of the polar ice sheets. The behaviour of these macrophysical problems can be interrogated by knowing the details of the microscopic properties of water: small variations in the abundance of naturally occurring heavy oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in water. Utilising the stable isotope chemistry requires integrating many scientific disciplines and linking disparate areas of theoretical, observational and modeling techniques.<br><br><br>Professor Noone will give examples of the coupling of carbon and water cycles in forests, and in the interaction of forest fire and clouds. He will discuss the importance of the sciences which form the kernel that enable evidence-based decision making, and the opportunities for leveraging physical sciences to empower communities to shape their responses to climate change.<br><br>For more videos from the University of Auckland, visit our YouTube brand channel: https://www.youtube.com/UNIofAUCKLAND</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p

my<br>very great pleasure to welcome you<br>to the inaugural lecture of professor<br>david noon<br>uh the holder of the buckley glavish<br>chair in climate physics<br>david's an atmospheric and climate<br>physicist very appropriate for the<br>weather today<br>he got into this area because he wanted<br>to win sailing races<br>in high school he had a sailing coach he<br>said if you want to win races you need<br>to know about weather<br>so he went on to study meteorology maths<br>and the physics of weather forecasts at<br>the university of melbourne<br>gaining a bsc honours and a phd the<br>postdoctor<br>post doctor at caltech studying<br>chemistry and wind patterns in the<br>arctic<br>then followed positions at the<br>university of colorado and oregon state<br>university<br>receiving a number of high-profile<br>awards including won by the obama<br>administration in 2011<br>won last year by the leading<br>professional organisation<br>in his area the american geophysical<br>union<br>david arrived in auckland that started<br>this year still with a keen interest in<br>sailing<br>but now on sale awards of rare sorts<br>although he tells me that his<br>sailboards are left behind at oregon and<br>so he's been parted from his passion<br>the speciality is on understanding<br>relationships between water<br>clouds and changing global wind patterns<br>he's most well known for his work<br>blending isotope ratios in the<br>atmosphere<br>and on the landscape with more<br>traditional atmospheric science in both<br>modelling<br>and observational contexts he helps<br>build and use climate models that are<br>used to predict<br>future climate change he has served as a<br>member of several nasa space<br>mission space teams including<br>earth observing spacecraft and aircraft<br>missions designed<br>to measure the composition of the<br>atmosphere<br>as the research takes someone as<br>students around the world to investigate<br>climate change<br>from the rainstorms over lush forests of<br>new guinea<br>equatorial oases of the galapagos desert<br>mountain tops in hawaii<br>and the endless ice fields of greenland<br>perhaps not so much<br>lately he delights in teaching weather<br>and climate in the classroom<br>and honours field classes observing<br>climate<br>but his preferred platform to observe<br>wind and waves<br>has a sail he considers himself a<br>theorist<br>he likes to balance the pragmatics of a<br>screwdriver and voltmeter<br>doing field work while still enjoying<br>writing climate models<br>and much beloved ancient programme<br>languages<br>a four-year project he led in remote<br>greenland allowed him to practise more<br>plumbing<br>electrical and construction than he<br>cares to admit<br>kia orange coat so thank you very much<br>john and<br>thank you everybody for coming along it<br>is indeed a rainy day today i was<br>talking with my class this morning about<br>the amount of rainfall we're getting<br>it's really quite extreme there's more<br>rain slightly north of here than you get<br>in the atmosphere as a whole if you<br>squeeze it out<br>this is really quite a brave day for you<br>all to come to a talk about climbing<br>i wanted to recognize a few people uh a<br>couple of people who<br>are not here i want to recognize my<br>partner joanna smith who's uh<br>i'm looking after our brand new hubby<br>that puppies can't be left<br>by themselves so she's on puppy duty<br>today<br>i also wanted to recognize bill buckley<br>who is<br>one of the supporters of the chair and<br>also<br>someone who provides an inspiration with<br>respect to<br>innovation in utilizing technology to<br>get to uh<br>our scientific uh uh ends as well as<br>himself well i had the opportunity to<br>spend a little bit of time with bill uh<br>at buckley systems where i was vastly<br>impressed by the hand-crafted wooden<br>boat there to be honest i think<br>perhaps a similar interest i also want<br>to recognize hilton glavis who's unable<br>to join us<br>uh uh here in person he's uh on zoom<br>around somewhere in the aether here<br>he's in the u.s and stuck in amongst all<br>the<br>uh lockdown uh issues there uh in the<br>u.s which i<br>uh also like to thank hilton<br>specifically that it's<br>of course the middle of the night there<br>and so to his his<br>support of the the physics department<br>and the university as a whole<br>is greatly recognized um i wanted to<br>talk about a few things today uh this<br>evening<br>uh and to give you an idea of really<br>sort of three things one<br>uh introduce myself a little bit and<br>some of the things that i'm interested<br>in<br>two some of the challenges i see with<br>respect to the<br>climate system and the way in which<br>climate sciences can play a role in<br>thinking about<br>climate change<br>policy and actions into the future and<br>then third hopefully<br>to give you a little bit of a flavor of<br>some of the the reasons that i like<br>science and how i like to share it with<br>others<br>and in some ways this sort of speaks a<br>little bit to what i think is a bit of a<br>redefinition of the way that<br>universities function<br>uh in a worldwide sense and maybe here<br>at auckland we have an area an<br>opportunity to lead<br>in that area so i wanted to start off by<br>talking a little bit<br>uh um about uh by the way those who have<br>cameras please wave or something if the<br>audio is not<br>appropriate there's enough microphones i<br>suspect um i wanted<br>first of all to describe for you<br>uh my home here it is<br>this is uh the first full uh disc<br>uh image of the earth reportedly taken<br>by the first scientist to land on the<br>moon<br>jack schmidt was on apollo 17 the last<br>of the<br>apollo missions to land there was an 18<br>which got<br>axed in the budget he was a geologist<br>and i actually had the the chance to<br>meet uh jack<br>at caltech when they did the 30 year<br>anniversary of<br>the apollo landings uh and and he<br>he uh there's this this debate about who<br>took this picture actually and uh<br>the the commander of the the apollo uh<br>uh 17 thought it was actually him<br>because they were both running around<br>taking photos<br>and of course jack said no no is<br>absolutely me uh one of the little d<br>and this hasn't been resolved it's<br>turned into a feud between the two of<br>them<br>it's it's likely that it was jack partly<br>because<br>uh he was a geologist so on the flight<br>between<br>uh earth and the moon he actually had<br>nothing else to do so he's probably<br>looking out the window<br>so goes the popular myth uh hopefully<br>one of the things that you see<br>here is what i see and that is home uh<br>we can see a variety of detail<br>here and and and some of them are<br>worthwhile pointing out<br>obviously the cloud structures there we<br>can see over the<br>southern oceans uh we see spiraling<br>bands<br>in the tropical areas towards the top we<br>see little bubbly types of clouds where<br>there's convection<br>we see the dark blue underneath which is<br>the ocean of course<br>towards the pole we can see antarctica<br>the ice sheet of the antarctic<br>east antarctic ice sheet there poking<br>out beneath the clouds<br>uh and of course we can see the<br>continent of africa there where<br>the two colors are important there's<br>brown where there are no plants<br>and there are there's green where it<br>rains<br>in fact everything i've just described<br>to you is effectively the water cycle<br>so when we think of earth and the<br>climate system as a whole we're actually<br>swimming in water it's all around us and<br>it's essential<br>to the way in which the climate system<br>functions as well as the way in which we<br>understand how the climate system<br>functions<br>one of the things that you know from<br>your home is you know where you left the<br>keys<br>you know that there's probably no milk<br>left in the fridge you actually know<br>all sorts of details about your home uh<br>just because you're there and that's<br>also true in this case<br>i can describe for you all sorts of<br>details<br>about our home i can tell you things<br>about the microstructure<br>of snowflakes and why this is the shape<br>of snowflakes i can tell you<br>why there are six branches i can tell<br>you why sometimes they're skinny why<br>they get wide<br>and how that's related to the<br>temperature and humidity inside the<br>clouds<br>so too if they are different shapes<br>sometimes they've got freckles<br>i can tell you why they've got freckles<br>this snowflake fell through a cloud that<br>had liquid water drops as it fell<br>through those drops were collected and<br>we see those when they<br>arrive at the ground there's also more<br>complicated ones where they join<br>together and all sorts of other<br>structures<br>we know the physics and the science of<br>these snowflakes well enough<br>that we can understand what they tell us<br>when we see them that level of detail is<br>similar<br>to how you may know where you left your<br>keys around the house<br>that's not to say i always know where i<br>left the keys there are cases where i<br>don't know why the snowflakes are as<br>they are<br>but that level of detail and our level<br>of understanding is really pivotal to<br>the way in which we understand<br>the way the earth works we can go<br>further if we know how one snowflake<br>forms or multiple snowflakes<br>we can go to exotic locations with teams<br>of scientists here we are standing in<br>front of<br>a 50 meter tower in the greenland ice<br>sheet<br>looking at using laser-based instruments<br>to measure not one snowflake but every<br>snowflake that fell<br>and build up statistics on the type of<br>snowflakes that were forming giving us<br>information<br>about the humidity and temperature of<br>the atmosphere<br>we can also dig holes in the ice sheet<br>here's a photo of the greenland ice<br>sheet<br>showing sort of a an infinite horizon<br>with<br>snow every direction you look uh when<br>we're in greenland we're there for<br>uh uh four summers for<br>about a month and a half each time there<br>uh it always reminded me<br>about of being out at sea not that i've<br>actually spent much time out at sea<br>you're in a little hut it's a building<br>it's got a kitchen<br>and that sort of thing there you look<br>out the window in every direction<br>up there on stilts you look and you see<br>the horizon with white snow in every<br>direction<br>but that's not to say it's all the same<br>if you dig down as we did here<br>uh apparently elsewhere else you can do<br>in greenland if there's snow you can dig<br>a hole<br>uh you can have a look at this and you<br>know we what we've done here is we dug a<br>hole<br>uh it's about uh two metres deep two<br>meters across it actually extends<br>towards you about five meters<br>we had so much fun digging this hole we<br>dug another one<br>on the other side of this wall it<br>happens to be facing south<br>towards the sun so what you're looking<br>at is a wall of snow that's about<br>that wide half a meter wide or so and<br>where the sunlight penetrates through<br>in different layers you can start to<br>pick out an indication of changes in the<br>the shape and the crystal makeup of the<br>snowflakes that have formed or the snow<br>that's piled up<br>where it's optically dense the sunlight<br>doesn't get through<br>and the light is channeling through<br>between the ice crystals different<br>for where it's more optically<br>transparent i<br>point out these two bright lines that<br>are sorted towards the top<br>what we're able to do is identify that<br>those two lines are associated with two<br>specific weather events<br>because we're making measurements of the<br>individual snowflakes we can relate<br>what's happening at the surface to<br>deeper down this is helpful<br>we had the patience to dig a hole two<br>metres deep<br>but you can use drills to go down<br>several kilometers<br>and you can then start to pick up<br>information about past weather and past<br>climate<br>by looking at the composition of the<br>snowflakes in that case compacted to ice<br>as you go down deeper so again because<br>we know the physics and the details of<br>these little snowflakes and how<br>they change their properties as the<br>snowpack accumulates we can use that<br>information<br>to get some idea of not what our home is<br>like now<br>but how our home has changed over the<br>many millennia<br>that it took to build up the ice sheets<br>let me talk to you about another home uh<br>this is where i used to live<br>in oregon a little town called hood<br>river we see in the background mount<br>hood<br>which is an active volcano last erupted<br>just a couple of decades ago<br>mount hood has a famous sibling mounts<br>and helens is across the river<br>in washington state and famously erupted<br>more vigorously<br>a couple of decades ago this area<br>has a different type of environment<br>again we see snow is important<br>snow here is the principal supply of<br>water when snow falls on the mountains<br>it stays there during winter time melts<br>slowly into the streams and ultimately<br>feeds<br>towns with fresh water during the<br>summertime<br>hood river you can see in the distance<br>there uh there's agricultural fields<br>this is an area<br>uh where there's a lot of uh pears and<br>apples grown it's actually one of the<br>the hot spots for cherries that have<br>been grown in the u.s<br>i was talking to one of the farmers<br>there and he was saying that their<br>cherries are the best in the world<br>no surprise he said they're so good that<br>they pick them<br>in the morning before sunrise by<br>midday they're on an airplane and then<br>by dinner time someone's eating them for<br>dessert in tokyo<br>and they transfer them that quickly so<br>it's a major industry and the transport<br>there is<br>remarkably efficient to allow that very<br>high quality produce<br>these perfect cherries to be exported um<br>this place is also<br>famous for its geological history that<br>at the end of the last ice age<br>there's large ice sheets across north<br>america that melted and very abruptly<br>uh channeled out this uh<br>this chasm here it's the columbia river<br>gorge<br>in the 1930s the gorge the columbia<br>river that we see here<br>was damned to produce huge amounts of<br>hydroelectric power also<br>it was a major infrastructure investment<br>as part of the<br>recovery from the great depression at<br>that stage<br>an important detail here of course those<br>dams allowed lakes to form which<br>not only changed the landscape and some<br>of the ecology but provided new industry<br>and particularly it provided a<br>recreational<br>industries windsurfing is very important<br>here as uh the<br>the canyon here the gorge forms a wind<br>tunnel<br>why does it form a wind tunnel the<br>atmospheric circulation is such that in<br>summertime<br>inland the air warms up and pulls air<br>along that canyon<br>and reliably at 11 o'clock in the<br>morning the winds will come up to about<br>25 knots<br>and the winds will stop pretty much<br>exactly when the 6<br>30 train from portland oregon to spokane<br>washington goes past<br>the winds drop back down at nighttime we<br>know this well we know why that train<br>uh is a good indicator it's because the<br>sun sets<br>it's actually not the train that stops<br>the wind luckily we know the physics<br>there we're not confused by that<br>correlation<br>uh another uh point i wanted to make<br>here is this is a very different<br>environment we're seeing<br>again water dominates uh where did this<br>water come from well we actually know<br>most of it comes from canada and it<br>flows down south and into the columbia<br>river<br>it's a major water supply for irrigation<br>and agriculture<br>the other thing that's important here<br>these are some of the luscious<br>rainforests<br>their temperate rainforests and forests<br>generally in north america<br>giant douglas fir trees when i was<br>growing up<br>in australia my parents built a house<br>back in the early 80s and part of the uh<br>the um the beams were formed of this<br>this wood that was called oregon<br>okay it's oregon that's a type of tree i<br>suppose but in fact it's douglas fir<br>trees from this place in oregon<br>in australia is just referred to as<br>oregon so these trees are a major export<br>of not only their wood but the carbon<br>that's stored<br>in that wood so let me show you a<br>picture of<br>my new home here it is i arrived in<br>auckland<br>i had second thoughts<br>the sky was a little glum i was promised<br>warm sunshine<br>clouds lovely harbour views what in fact<br>we had<br>this is several days after arrived what<br>we're looking at here is smoke from the<br>australian bushfires<br>uh also the case in oregon we have<br>forest fires very actively<br>you can see immediately that this is<br>approximately midday we can see the<br>smoke layer<br>quite high in the atmosphere with other<br>clouds down below it and looking out<br>towards the horizon we can see that the<br>air in the bottom part of the atmosphere<br>is actually quite clear there's not much<br>smoke pollution<br>so we might imagine that the way in<br>which sunlight is interacting with<br>the clouds and the smoke in the<br>atmosphere<br>changes depending on its composition and<br>in particular we can see the horizon low<br>down but higher up<br>the uh the sun is obscured the way in<br>which clouds<br>and smoke interact is a major question<br>when we start thinking about<br>our global climate one of the things<br>that<br>inquisitive scientists do like my puppy<br>is go and stick their noses in it to<br>stick your nose<br>in clouds you need to fly around<br>so we've been involved recently uh up in<br>a project which is<br>actually just ended i suppose trying to<br>look at the way in which clouds and<br>smoke interact the way to do this of<br>course is to find<br>some of your best friends who some of<br>them know how to fly planes some of them<br>know how to<br>measure wind some of them know how to<br>measure the chemical composition of<br>smoke some of them know how to<br>measure characteristics of clouds<br>and beforehand getting together as a<br>group we can figure out what's the right<br>combination of measurements we should<br>make where should we make those<br>measurements<br>and how do we understand this system<br>which we don't understand well<br>so this particular mission had something<br>like 150 scientists<br>a small fraction of whom are shown here<br>the team<br>uh i should mention there's one of the<br>graduate students here amy who's sitting<br>where is she sitting at the front there<br>with sunglasses on right about there<br>she used to walk around at 4am getting<br>ready or 5am getting ready for the<br>flight<br>muttering uh teamwork that's what makes<br>the dream work<br>preparations look like this we have our<br>high-tech instruments<br>jen small here who's a professor at<br>university of hawaii she is a<br>laser-based instrument<br>as that sits on the wing pod there the<br>aircraft moving forward<br>individual cloud droplets hit the laser<br>beam and the characteristics of that<br>droplet<br>uh are measured its size and its shape<br>there are other instruments on board<br>where our measurements for instance we<br>pull air in from outside the aircraft<br>and we have again actually laser-based<br>instruments that are measuring the<br>chemical composition<br>uh of the water in particular<br>as john mentioned earlier we look at the<br>stabilizer topic composition<br>of the cloud droplets which is a<br>remarkable technological feat to be able<br>to fly through a cloud<br>at 150 meters per second and measure the<br>chemistry of<br>the cloud droplets as we go along<br>so what do these things look like the<br>place where we were looking was uh<br>in the south atlantic the southeast<br>atlantic off the coast of africa where<br>there's very strong<br>seasonal biomass burning uh this is<br>where a third of the world's smoke is<br>produced over<br>a short number of months and the types<br>of clouds that we see here<br>are indicated here looking out the<br>window these are low-level clouds and<br>the way in which smoke and other<br>component<br>constituents of the atmosphere interact<br>with clouds<br>becomes important in identifying or<br>determining how reflective they are<br>but also the patterns that they may make<br>do they make<br>these open clusters where they're<br>individual pockets or are they more<br>organized<br>into little rings little hexagonal rings<br>and things like this<br>the dynamics of these clouds and the<br>systems that make clouds<br>related in part to their energy balance<br>which in turn is related to<br>um their brightness and their ability to<br>reflect or absorb<br>sunlight so what i've shown you from<br>three perspectives on my home<br>shows you hopefully that not just me<br>but climate scientists in their areas of<br>speciality<br>know a huge amount of detail about the<br>climate system in our natural<br>environment<br>to the degree that we can take this<br>inspiration from about 50 years ago a<br>famous<br>computer scientist who says science is<br>what we understand well enough to<br>explain it to a computer<br>and everything else is art we think we<br>know these things well we know the shape<br>of ice<br>the shape of snowflakes we could tell a<br>computer that we could allow a computer<br>to build snowflakes for us<br>inside uh digital snowflakes<br>so too we know something about the<br>motion of the atmosphere we could<br>describe that to a computer<br>and allow the computer to solve the<br>equations<br>that would be the language in which we<br>would describe them indeed this is<br>what's done<br>i have here i think i just click a<br>little animation of uh<br>such a calculation this one done<br>uh by the nasa goddard space flight<br>center uh<br>this is all equations a computer<br>simulation<br>of the atmosphere this is part of what<br>might be a climate model the atmospheric<br>component<br>what we're looking at here is we scroll<br>around the planet a little bit in the<br>different colors<br>a different constituents in the<br>atmosphere here you'll see africa<br>immediately there<br>with the orange and the green the orange<br>being dust<br>and that greeny white color being smoke<br>the red dots there are fires here is the<br>biomass burning season that we're seeing<br>vanish<br>we also see in the green here a variety<br>constituents in the atmosphere that<br>arise from plants<br>so to you can see off southeast asia<br>there the white colors<br>this is sulfur aerosols this is<br>associated principally in this case<br>from burning of coal uh actually<br>australia here with the smoke as well<br>from all those fires indicated by the<br>the uh the red and the yellows there in<br>the southern ocean here we are closer to<br>home<br>the blue is sea salt this is uh over the<br>ocean we see white caps<br>you can look outside we see white caps<br>that's associated with sea spray that's<br>formed off the top of the<br>of the cloud of the the ocean surface<br>that sea spray evaporates leaving a<br>little<br>sea salt particle which again can be<br>involved in<br>the spiraling formations of weather<br>systems<br>as we go through here there's one more<br>little event that we're waiting for<br>again the reason these can be made is we<br>know enough<br>about the climate system that we can<br>produce these things we see here<br>finally a volcanic eruption with huge<br>amounts of sulfur<br>spilling into the atmosphere we can<br>model these characteristics the swirling<br>behavior<br>these are emotions that are coming from<br>the fundamental<br>rules of physics and indeed the<br>fundamental rules<br>there are three of them we think mass is<br>conserved<br>we think energy is conserved and we<br>think momentum is conserved<br>these are great stories if you're<br>telling stories around the campfire<br>they're good stories to to depend on<br>these are the same equations that are<br>the same rules that allow us to describe<br>uh these spiraling motions so clearly<br>this level of sophistication<br>uh we must know so much maybe there's<br>not that much artwork involved here we<br>must know everything<br>in fact this is not quite true there's<br>still a lot of artistry here<br>the creative aspect for the parts for<br>which<br>our campfire stories of momentum mass<br>and energy<br>they don't seem to work well this<br>becomes a challenge<br>i wanted to highlight some emerging<br>results coming back to this idea of<br>how we connect these thoughts with<br>changing climate<br>i wanted to show a diagram from some<br>work that's emerging associated with a<br>new report<br>on on the climate system the ipcc<br>every six or seven years puts out a<br>report on the state of the climate<br>system what do we know what's the<br>the summary of uh scientific knowledge<br>on<br>changing climate and as part of that a<br>series of climate models are run with<br>standardized experiments<br>uh those experiments are described here<br>which i'll point out<br>there's this quantity that everybody is<br>fascinated by it's called climate<br>sensitivity<br>it has a definition uh there it is at<br>the top the change<br>in the temperature the earth's surface<br>temperature<br>uh depends on the forcing how much<br>energy we force the temperature with<br>and this little lambda guy there is a<br>feedback parameter a way in which<br>the forcing is amplified to some degree<br>to give us the change in the earth's<br>surface temperature<br>i'll draw your attention to the orange<br>bar on the right hand side<br>uh this is the latest models and again i<br>should say that this is now<br>uh these results are available and<br>they're in the process of undergoing<br>peer review and publication and all<br>those sorts of things<br>but they are very much hot off the press<br>what that bar is indicating<br>is that this collection of individual<br>models and there's about<br>30 or so there indicated by the the dots<br>on the bar<br>actually don't agree all of these models<br>they're effectively similar<br>there's a couple from the us there's one<br>from australia there's one from the uk<br>there's a couple from japan one from<br>germany a few others<br>uh numerous others they all believe in<br>the same three stories<br>mass momentum energy yet for some reason<br>they're giving very different answers<br>what is what is it that's different well<br>it's not the science we know well<br>it's the way in which this creative<br>process has been used to try and explain<br>the things we don't know well<br>importantly the quantity of interest<br>here climate sensitivity<br>uh if we look across to the left-hand<br>axis it tells us how much warming we<br>should get<br>if co2 is doubled uh relative to its<br>pre-industrial amount<br>in the pre-industrial is somewhere<br>around about 1750 where co2 in the<br>atmosphere is<br>about 280 parts per million today<br>we're up about 414 parts per million so<br>not quite double<br>but we're headed there the climate<br>sensitivity is on the vertical axis<br>there if again focusing on the<br>orange the models are suggesting that a<br>climate sensitivity between about 1.8<br>and 5.6 is a pretty reasonable range<br>that that is the range they span<br>on the left hand side this little black<br>box in fact the gray box is<br>uh even a refinement this is the best<br>estimate from<br>or a series of estimates from different<br>observationally inspired means<br>part of this is by using the chemistry<br>uh of<br>ice from antarctica and greenland<br>thinking about<br>the uh the changes in the uh the<br>chemistry<br>uh gives us some information about past<br>temperatures and there's a variety of<br>other means as well<br>it's telling us that well maybe the best<br>guess the best knowledge we have is<br>somewhere between 2.6<br>and 1.4 and again that's telling us that<br>we should expect<br>uh if doubling co2 relative to<br>pre-industrial<br>we would expect a warming of about two<br>and a half or<br>so to one sorry 4.1 degrees warming<br>uh by the time we get there so what does<br>that range mean in terms of a target you<br>can see i've indicated to there<br>that if we assume this higher climate<br>sensitivity which is to say<br>for a certain amount of co2 in the<br>atmosphere the temperature will go up<br>by 4.1 degrees well we'd actually have<br>to get<br>to 382 parts per million of co2<br>to hit the targets that new zealand has<br>committed to<br>new zealand has a policy where<br>the emissions are mandated to cap<br>emissions such that we satisfy<br>the international goal as in the paris<br>agreement<br>of 1.5 degrees of warming to hit that<br>target<br>at the high sensitivity we have to get<br>to a co2 concentration of 380<br>too we have a problem we're already<br>beyond that<br>the lower climate sensitivity 2.6 well<br>we get to 441<br>uh parts per million of co2 and we're at<br>414 that is<br>less that is good co2 is going up by<br>about three parts per billion<br>parts per million by uh per year maybe a<br>little bit more than that<br>so we've got about 10 years if the<br>climate models<br>are actually towards the lower end of<br>this sensitivity<br>if we're at the higher end of the<br>sensitivity then we've already got<br>problems<br>so one of the things that this should<br>give us some cause to be concerned about<br>is not that we're running out of time to<br>be proactive<br>the day has come and gone to be<br>proactive to prevent that one and a half<br>degree warming<br>the question now is how are we going to<br>respond to this new challenge<br>what are we going we're going to do to<br>reorganize our economies<br>to be mindful of these changes which is<br>coming and do we want to<br>cap the emissions in some ways so we<br>don't go much further<br>than what we've already committed to in<br>terms of warming<br>i wanted to address this question of<br>this sensitivity why is there so much<br>uncertainty uh somewhere between 1.8 and<br>6<br>5.6 that's a huge range of uncertainty<br>what is it that we don't know where have<br>we used this artistic<br>license to describe the climate system<br>and where could we improve<br>by uh understanding those uncertainties<br>well it comes in the way in which we<br>think about<br>the processes which are controlling this<br>feedback and<br>here i've i've done my very best at<br>drawing a<br>a circuit thinking of a little amplifier<br>where the surface temperature there as<br>it may increase there's a little<br>feedback loop<br>which may increase or sometimes decrease<br>the temperature<br>before there's some sort of final result<br>there are numerous<br>particular mechanisms in the atmosphere<br>associated with these feedbacks<br>water vapor itself is critical to this<br>that<br>as the temperature rises our friends<br>clausius and clapeyron<br>some heroes of statistical mechanics<br>tell us the amount of water vapor that<br>we can have<br>in the air would increase so we have a<br>feedback<br>a small change in temperature would<br>change the amount of water vapor<br>which is a very potent greenhouse gas<br>and so it would<br>accelerate the warming there are others<br>clouds there's a feedback associated<br>with clouds that can be both positive<br>and negative<br>but on average is positive uh associated<br>with either high clouds or low clouds<br>so too how the the rate of decreasing<br>temperature with altitude<br>is important as well as the way in which<br>we change the landscape<br>if we cover the earth's surface with<br>something very reflective sunlight is<br>reflected the planet remains cooler<br>if we cover the earth's surface with<br>something that's dark the energy is<br>absorbed and the earth's surface warms<br>up<br>it turns out we like to chop down rain<br>forests to dark and replace them by<br>agricultural fields<br>which tend to be a little brighter and<br>although we enjoy<br>the proceeds of that agriculture it's<br>not without consequence<br>so the real question here is<br>understanding these feedbacks these are<br>the origins<br>of the uncertainties we don't know the<br>magnitude of these feedbacks well<br>because there are emergent<br>characteristics of the simulations<br>there's no equation that says feedback<br>equals<br>mass momentum energy that equation<br>doesn't exist it<br>emerges from a variety of other<br>calculations<br>so systematically identifying which of<br>these are dominating<br>becomes important also<br>and not coincidentally it doesn't take<br>too much imagination to recognize that<br>each of these are associated with the<br>water cycle in the atmosphere<br>uh biospheric production here that as<br>plants grow<br>they take out co2 from the atmosphere<br>but at the cost of water from the soil<br>there's transpiration to the soil<br>so understanding the way in which water<br>moves around in the atmosphere<br>and in the climate system becomes<br>pivotal<br>to understanding these feedbacks<br>you might ask don't we know where the<br>water is well most of it's in the ocean<br>earlier on i said there's a whole bunch<br>of it in the antarctic ice sheet<br>uh there's rain gauges we know where it<br>rains<br>surely we must know how much water there<br>is no<br>it's actually remarkably not well known<br>how much where the water is<br>and how much it changes an example of<br>this<br>is indicated here where a study looked<br>at<br>several different models of the way in<br>which<br>water is distributed on the landscape<br>imagine water falling as precipitation<br>it can land on the surface of leaves and<br>be intercepted<br>by the leaves which is ultimately<br>indicated there in the blue<br>can go into the soils and then<br>subsequently can evaporate from the<br>soils<br>indicated by red or once that water that<br>rainfall is in the soils<br>it can be transpired by plants indicated<br>by the green<br>and you'll see immediately that for<br>about the same amount of rainfall<br>these three different models allocate<br>that water<br>let's see with the one i want to<br>highlight here the one on the left for<br>instance<br>has a lot of the water that goes into<br>the soil and comes back as evaporation<br>as compared to the one on in the middle<br>there goes into the soil and comes out<br>through the plants as transpiration<br>these are huge differences<br>absolutely amazingly large differences<br>and these are<br>now a couple of years old but<br>characteristic of the best<br>knowledge that we have on the way in<br>which water is distributed distribute on<br>the landscape<br>this is a major gap<br>we can go back a little further<br>500 bc it was known that the sea is the<br>source of the waters and the source of<br>the winds for that matter<br>without the great sea not from the<br>clouds would come the flowing rivers of<br>the heavens rains<br>but the great sea is the father of<br>clouds of rivers and winds<br>so that was pretty much well known for<br>quite some time the water<br>basically comes from the ocean the big<br>wet thing<br>actually some nice subtleties to this i<br>i don't know if this particular<br>philosopher was thinking about the<br>atmospheric circulation<br>uh several millennia later that too i<br>suppose<br>uh there's some more thoughts on this<br>which tell a more modern story<br>but i wanted to use this early<br>inspiration for thinking about water<br>coming from the ocean<br>to describe some of the ways that we're<br>going about solving this problem how are<br>we going to improve our knowledge of the<br>climate system<br>what we do is we try and use the<br>chemical signature the isotopic<br>composition of water<br>to provide a fingerprint water comes<br>from the ocean there's a fingerprint<br>in the chemistry of seawater<br>the fingerprint changes so what we're<br>looking at<br>are a couple of flavors of water there's<br>a regular water<br>h2o an o with two h's hanging off it<br>there's uh actually three of its little<br>friends that we look at<br>only two here one in which the uh oxygen<br>has two additional neutrons so it's a<br>little bit heavier oxygen 18.<br>still water behaves like water and a<br>version where there's an extra neutron<br>on one of the hydrogen atoms so it's<br>deuterium<br>and again it's a little bit heavier and<br>actually interestingly it's asymmetric<br>at that point<br>which becomes important because of the<br>differences in the shape of the<br>molecules<br>and the way in which the molecule itself<br>can store energy is vibration or<br>rotations<br>it turns out the uh beloved classiest<br>clapeyron relationship telling us<br>the amount of water vapor that can be in<br>the air for a given temperature<br>is different for each of these three the<br>consequence being that<br>if we imagine a a volume<br>where there's liquid and water vapor<br>existing together<br>the relative proportion of the isotopes<br>will be different in the liquid relative<br>to the vapor<br>and predictably so we can make use of<br>this and in particular it turns out that<br>the heavier atoms<br>are heavier molecules the ones with the<br>extra neutrons they prefer to remain in<br>the liquid<br>uh whereas the residual beam is a<br>preference for the lighter isotopes to<br>be in the vapor state<br>um the reason for this<br>is actually not fully known but it's<br>fundamentally a quantum mechanical<br>effect about the way that energy is<br>stored within the particles within the<br>molecules themselves<br>for our context here an important detail<br>is this<br>the places on earth where evaporation<br>occurs is different from the place on<br>earth the condensation occurs<br>generally evaporation happens over the<br>warm oceans<br>whereas condensation is occurring in a<br>variety of places but there's a there's<br>a<br>more precipitation than evaporation over<br>land we know this because there are<br>rivers<br>so we can use this asymmetry in this<br>little<br>detail of the physics to give oceanic<br>water a fingerprint<br>and track the change in the fingerprint<br>as<br>condensation occurs in the atmosphere as<br>clouds form as precipitation forms<br>what does this actually look like well<br>imagine we've got a box full of water<br>vapor there it is<br>we put some heavy water and some light<br>water in our box<br>and we allow it to have some initial<br>isotope ratio<br>a little bit later on there might be<br>some condensation so in the upper box<br>there we have<br>water vapor the lower one there being<br>raindrops<br>and there would be a shift in the<br>isotope ratios<br>we would conserve mass the sum of the<br>blue<br>equals the blue on the left the sum of<br>the red equals the red on the left<br>but the relative proportions have<br>changed because of this<br>this isotopic fractionation effect it<br>actually works the same way as if you're<br>into<br>distilling whiskey or vodka or something<br>it's essentially a distillation process<br>or it's modeled as a distillation<br>process the<br>campfire story is yeah it's like a<br>distillation process<br>works well so the ice cube ratios will<br>change<br>if we continue this process the rain<br>falls out but we<br>keep the water vapor and we undergo this<br>condensation again<br>again the there's an isotopic split<br>where the heavier isotopes have a<br>preference to be in the condensate<br>and again it's removed and as time goes<br>by the<br>relative proportion consistently<br>decreases there's fewer and fewer<br>of the heavier isotope logs in the<br>volume great<br>let's have a look at this graphically uh<br>let's have an axis between 1 and 0. it's<br>going backwards i'm going to start on<br>the left<br>move to the right and the isotope ratio<br>the ratio of heavy to light isotopes<br>uh indicated there we start off with<br>some initial value<br>r naught maybe that's the ocean just<br>ratio of ocean water<br>as we have we start with 100 of our<br>vapor<br>one and we're going to systematically<br>start<br>condensing water out of that volume<br>until there's none left<br>we're removing some fraction between one<br>and zero<br>as condensation occurs the heavier<br>isotopes are removed preferentially<br>and by the powers of powerpoint we see<br>this absolutely lovely<br>logarithmic curve here that is<br>mathematically rigorous<br>indeed what we find is that the isotope<br>ratio<br>now of course the condensate will be<br>heavier than that because we have to<br>have this<br>asymmetry so if you're sitting in<br>antarctica and you're waiting for a<br>little piece of rainfall or snow<br>you might measure the isotope ratio of a<br>snowflake<br>and it would be something along that<br>dotted curve<br>we could ask okay let's take a variant<br>of this<br>if instead of all of that condensed<br>water that rainfall<br>instead of all of it falling out of the<br>atmosphere what happens if some of that<br>water hangs around as clouds<br>we know this is true we see clouds<br>that's water droplets that are not<br>precipitating<br>how does that change our fingerprint it<br>turns out the efficiency<br>with which this fractionation occurs is<br>weaker so we can separate<br>the efficiency with which water is<br>removed from the atmosphere<br>uh by using this isotopic measure the<br>same again<br>if we're looking at the snowflakes in<br>antarctica or the raindrops<br>it'd be a little bit different from that<br>so let me give a more pragmatic example<br>here<br>what i've described is indeed this<br>campfire story does it actually work<br>this way well<br>in some ways yes but some ways no one of<br>the key things that i haven't<br>described is how we actually do these<br>measurements<br>one of the ways we can now do it is<br>through satellite remote sensing making<br>use actually of the molecular structure<br>the rotational vibrational structure of<br>the molecules<br>to be able to detect photons emitted by<br>those molecules<br>from a space-based sensor and we can<br>translate those radiation measurements<br>the measurements of those photons<br>into estimates of these isotope ratios<br>indicated on the left<br>this one on the this diagram is actually<br>a special uh<br>one for me it happens to be observations<br>from january 6th<br>uh some number of years ago now i chose<br>that particular that happens to be my<br>father's birthday so i thought ah<br>what better to be on the front cover of<br>nature than my father's birthday<br>um that's a good idea<br>what we need to do though is we have to<br>be a little bit creative<br>we have to use some theory our<br>understanding of the physical processes<br>to turn that information into something<br>about the the distribution of water that<br>we care about<br>so we've taken this data and we've<br>developed a theoretical<br>framework a model a numerical model that<br>describes the way in which<br>water is distributed between the soil<br>deeper soil water<br>interception of the surface evaporation<br>from soils<br>or transpiration by plants we know the<br>physics of<br>the molecular separation the isotopic<br>fractionation associated<br>with each of these and similarly we know<br>something about the physics of the way<br>water moves through soils<br>and we can apply our isotopic knowledge<br>uh<br>to that uh that that physical model and<br>then use the data we have<br>to provide constraint on our<br>understanding and what we've been able<br>to do here in this<br>this analysis is to use the isotopic<br>information to come up with numbers so<br>where we had those three models that<br>ranged greatly in their partitioning of<br>the water on the landscape<br>we now have an observational constraint<br>of what the correct answer should be<br>and what we've had to do to do that is<br>use all three parts we've had to use a<br>creative process<br>the art of the modeling process we have<br>to imagine<br>what the correct system should be we've<br>had to apply the rigorous aspects of the<br>sciences to make sure that we've<br>done that in the right way and then<br>finally making use of data to pull all<br>that together<br>ends up with the final knowledge that we<br>have and in some ways<br>if there's a takeaway a single take away<br>message from this presentation it's<br>essentially captured here<br>that all of these parts have to come<br>together the role of universities<br>and the sciences of climate sciences<br>is to make sure that this pathway works<br>effectively<br>i want to show you another example i've<br>talked about clouds i wanted to show you<br>a cloud example<br>as i mentioned earlier uh inquisitive<br>puppies and scientists are the same they<br>can't keep their noses out of things<br>they're interested in<br>i like clouds so again i found some<br>friends<br>and we put our instruments on board an<br>aircraft<br>and went in this case into the caribbean<br>near saint croix and we looked at<br>conditions in clouds<br>in this case let me orient you towards<br>this diagram on the vertical axis<br>it happens to be pressure which we can<br>think of as altitude<br>and we measured the amount of<br>cloud water in the red the amount of<br>water vapor in the blue<br>but of course we also measured the<br>isotopic composition and here is where i<br>wanted to illustrate this fingerprint<br>idea<br>that in the blue is the isotopic<br>composition of water vapor this is the<br>water vapor outside clouds whereas the<br>red<br>is the isotopic composition of the cloud<br>water this is water inside the clouds<br>and what we notice is there's a<br>particular altitude somewhere around<br>about<br>500 hectare passes on this diagram where<br>the blue line takes a rapid turn to the<br>right<br>and has similar values to the isotopic<br>composition of the cloud droplets<br>this is where clouds are going upwards<br>in the atmosphere and are spilling out<br>into the environment<br>the atmosphere is being moistened by<br>cloud droplets and other material<br>coming out of the top of these clouds<br>detrainment so what we're able to do<br>here is to identify<br>this shift in the environment as being<br>related to where we're getting<br>detrainment into<br>the environment this is a key component<br>of one of these feedbacks the water<br>vapor feedback<br>and arguably some of the cloud feedbacks<br>as well some of the leading<br>uncertainties in climate models<br>we have a way of fingerprinting the<br>process one of the processes<br>in using the same data we can do another<br>little<br>detail here and we can ask well we've<br>got these two isotopes<br>oxygen 18 and deuterium how about we<br>compare the two of them<br>and it turns out when we do this and we<br>look at the center of the cloud the<br>maximum<br>updraft the maximum updraft velocity<br>inside the<br>the updraft versus the cloudy part<br>around the edges of the cloud<br>we can look at this change in the<br>isotopic composition from the outside to<br>the inside<br>and what we find is there's a split<br>between the data the blue versus the red<br>the way i've done that separation is by<br>using information about<br>the updraft velocities inside the cloud<br>i should note<br>what that actually means is when you're<br>flying along in these clouds<br>the aircraft has accelerometers and<br>other instruments on board<br>so as you may know from commercial<br>flights if you fly into a cloud you feel<br>it<br>it's essentially the same information<br>but there's uh sensors on board that can<br>detect<br>that vertical motion uh which could be<br>quite vigorous for research aircraft<br>what we're looking at here is the<br>separation of red data on the left blue<br>data on the right<br>we have the theory we understand the<br>science well enough that we know<br>that values on the right hand side are<br>associated with<br>ice crystal formation and those that are<br>more on the left hand side<br>are associated with freezing of liquid<br>water drops two very different ways to<br>create ice in clouds<br>the consequence is associated with how<br>one might<br>numerically model these clouds and<br>ultimately<br>how one may improve the way they're<br>depicted in climate models<br>so again if we're thinking about how we<br>do this that<br>we need teams of people and in<br>particular<br>this particular mission was a different<br>group of about 50 people<br>to understand the science and the theory<br>that allows<br>this isotopic information to come<br>together requires a team which over the<br>last<br>10 or 15 years has been established<br>here's the family they all live on the<br>same home<br>this is a group of scientists who are<br>dedicated to trying to<br>improve this detail and there are many<br>other groups like it<br>the point i'd like to make here is that<br>although i've described some of the<br>field<br>aspects and some of the work that we've<br>been doing we're not alone and we don't<br>do this alone we do it as teams what we<br>learn we share with others<br>and hopefully they can take our ideas<br>and do it better<br>and ultimately science is about making<br>sure we all move forward<br>and complete things in the best way we<br>can but also make sure there's a pathway<br>for others<br>to be even more successful so i wanted<br>to leave<br>with a couple of final thoughts here<br>first that uh<br>it's a general statement i suppose and<br>i'm always shocked<br>in some ways when i teach classes i<br>taught a class this morning on<br>actually all imaginative things clouds<br>uh<br>and as i was preparing my lectures<br>yesterday i my lecture yesterday i<br>thought to myself<br>you know everything i'm about to tell<br>these students they could actually find<br>on wikipedia or<br>look it up somehow i'm actually not the<br>only source of information<br>that's not true 30 years ago<br>information came from professors and<br>universities we were the source of<br>knowledge the source of facts<br>facts are now everywhere the best thing<br>that we can now do is teach our students<br>how to be analytical<br>and think about which facts should be<br>used when why and which facts<br>and not actually as many as as factual<br>as they say they should be<br>so there is a major shift in the<br>function of universities in the function<br>of training<br>similarly at the same time we're<br>undergoing a massive shift in<br>the the types of scientific capacities<br>we have the ability to observe<br>the ability to go to places where we<br>wish and need to observe things<br>maybe it's the small scale maybe it's<br>the large scale<br>both the the the improvements in the<br>observational<br>technology as well as the technology<br>to synthesize that information into<br>knowledge essentially associated with<br>algorithms and<br>computations that lead us to allow<br>new theories to utilize data in ways we<br>may not have thought of<br>and finally broader inspiration for<br>creativity<br>in this process is essential the missing<br>part is actually making sure that we've<br>got the art<br>right there are many choices in dealing<br>with the parts of the story we don't<br>know we know<br>f equals m a nearly always<br>uh there's some quantum mechanics that<br>make that not quite right<br>or some relativity i should say but we<br>know those rules are<br>right what we don't have is the equation<br>for a leaf<br>or a cloud so we have to think of<br>creative ways to deal with that<br>so the ways we find inspiration for<br>thinking about those problems<br>they may be scientific but they need not<br>be they may come from everywhere<br>so the idea of thinking about ways that<br>universities can serve broader<br>communities actually serves the creative<br>process<br>in making sure the rigors of science are<br>moving forward in the right way<br>in that regard i think climate sciences<br>has transformed over the last even<br>five years if not sooner uh and there<br>has been this transformation<br>where once upon a time climate science<br>was focused on understanding what is<br>going on how is it going<br>we sort of know those answers we know<br>where our uncertainties are and there<br>are<br>many people working on those problems<br>but that's not enough we have to come<br>back with the pragmatics here<br>that the climate is changing and we have<br>to deal with it so we have now a<br>pragmatic mandate<br>as climate scientists to make sure we're<br>using the rigors of scientific training<br>to inform decisions in ways that the<br>climate science community may actually<br>feel quite uncomfortable with<br>uh in a historical uh uh standpoint<br>so i'll leave you with one final image<br>this one this is today's picture of<br>earth<br>from the goes west it's actually goes 15<br>the u.s weather satellite the<br>geostationary satellite<br>uh we can see now new zealand just on<br>the edge there<br>uh and you can correct me if i'm wrong<br>but if i was to analyze this i<br>think it's probably raining<br>so my final remark is this that we've<br>gone from 1972<br>apollo 17 we end up here today<br>we know about the climate system well<br>enough and now the question is<br>what are we and what are our future<br>thanks</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
