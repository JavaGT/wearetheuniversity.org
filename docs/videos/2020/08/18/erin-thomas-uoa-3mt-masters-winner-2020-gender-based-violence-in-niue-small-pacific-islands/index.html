font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>when we look at a family tree<br>we see the past our roots living deep<br>beneath us the present<br>of ourselves and our relations and the<br>future of descendants and descendants to<br>come while the lineage remains the same<br>the stories we tell about these<br>relations are constantly being<br>negotiated<br>my research is focused on the stories we<br>tell about gender relations<br>and more specifically gender-based<br>violence in the family<br>now use the term gender-based violence<br>to include the range of violent acts<br>used disproportionately by men against<br>women<br>as a result of gender inequality sexual<br>violence domestic violence financial and<br>emotional abuse<br>are all examples of the ways in which<br>how the ways in which we relate to one<br>another by gender<br>can result in harm my research took me<br>to the small pacific country of nue<br>located between samoa and tonga nui has<br>largely fallen through the cracks in<br>terms of seeing what gender-based<br>violence looks like on the island<br>now gender-based violence is difficult<br>to research because as you can imagine<br>it's difficult to talk about<br>this is particularly true in a small<br>place like new a and when we're<br>researching<br>social issues we also want to know more<br>than there is a problem<br>we want to talk solutions too in my<br>research i used a new approach<br>to look at the space most nuanced named<br>as the most important when it comes to<br>dealing with gender-based violence<br>the family i met with 14 new and women<br>to map their family trees and to discuss<br>relationships using a narrative tylenola<br>blended approach<br>we started by creating a family tree<br>like the one you see here<br>on a big a3 sheet of paper and that<br>became the roadmap for the rest of our<br>conversation<br>we talked about what makes a<br>relationship strong and what can cause<br>problems<br>instead of talking about her and i we<br>were talking about cousins and aunties<br>and grandchildren<br>discussing relationships in the family<br>in this way is natural<br>and familiar and it likely is for most<br>of us but what's really compelling about<br>this approach<br>is that we learn that the family space<br>is full of opportunities<br>and in my findings i've grouped these<br>into four areas<br>disclosure and how we support those who<br>have been harmed to share<br>gossip and how we think and talk about<br>gender-based violence<br>education and how we learn and unlearn<br>gender norms<br>and of course accountability and how we<br>respond to those who have caused harm<br>now this family tree mapping approach<br>can be effective both in researching<br>gender-based violence<br>as well as responding to it as a method<br>that honors women's knowledge and<br>authority<br>while centering the family's critical<br>context<br>this is the space where conversations<br>must continue<br>from survivors and bystanders from the<br>suspicious and the curious<br>engaging with family in this way is a<br>pathway for change<br>and it's here we see how our family<br>trees live through our relations<br>they can be spaces to heal and to shape<br>the stories of how we relate to one<br>another</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
