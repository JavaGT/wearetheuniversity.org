down in<br>my um first economics class<br>and thinking this was the best decision<br>of my life the amount of intellectual<br>stimulation and engagement you get from<br>your classmates and<br>the faculty there it was amazing my wife<br>and i<br>we love new zealand very much and we<br>want to experience<br>new zealand we want to experience the<br>beautiful views the beautiful landscape<br>the countries the people so that's why i<br>wanted to<br>go there to dunadine to take the mba<br>course in university of otago<br>besides that why university of targo<br>because<br>university of otago has the best mba<br>program<br>in new zealand 15 years as a lawyer<br>and working in a corporate environment<br>having moved out of private practice<br>quite early in my career<br>i found that i was operating more in a<br>strategic and commercial<br>environment and providing advice to the<br>business and those kind of areas rather<br>than purely as a lawyer<br>but as time went on i felt like there<br>were a number of skills that i needed to<br>round out<br>and thinking about it quite deeply<br>realised that an mba would probably be<br>the best way for me to do that<br>so i could cover a lot of areas in one<br>place and really<br>move to the next level in my career and<br>out of law the toughest thing for me<br>about coming to the full time on<br>on-campus<br>program was that i had to leave a<br>full-time job and obviously<br>the money that comes with that but<br>completing the program full-time<br>meant that i could get it over and done<br>with pretty quickly and back into the<br>workforce<br>i'm fortunate enough to have a<br>scholarship through the gi bill from my<br>experience in the army<br>one of the deciding factors for coming<br>here was the fact that the gi bill<br>covers full tuition costs so with my<br>past experience in the army<br>i have a lot of good skills to transfer<br>into business<br>but i kind of lacked the ability to make<br>that translation<br>so i feel like the mba is really setting<br>me up to be able to communicate better<br>in a business environment<br>and put the skills that i have from my<br>previous work experience to better use<br>i wanted to get a holistic perspective<br>of the entire<br>organizational machinery how do the<br>different parts work together<br>because before the mba i had worked only<br>on one part and that is what i had<br>excelled in but i didn't really<br>fully deeply understand how does the<br>whole machinery work so it was important<br>for me to get that holistic perspective<br>before i get back onto my corporate<br>journey<br>so this mba is a 16-month program<br>consisting of two phases phase one and<br>phase two<br>now phase one really was all about the<br>core uh business papers<br>uh which kind of helped develop a<br>holistic business perspective<br>on how to run an organization<br>effectively and how to manage an<br>organization effectively<br>phase two really is about choosing your<br>paths<br>as to what is it that you want to do<br>the most enjoyable thing about studying<br>the mba is as it normally is is the<br>people it is a very diverse group of<br>people which has challenges but also<br>brings with it an opportunity to really<br>experience<br>a lot more than you might otherwise do<br>so<br>we've had some great times exploring a<br>little bit of the south island had the<br>opportunity to go to queenstown<br>on a number of occasions to go both<br>skiing and<br>hiking on that side of the world i think<br>probably one of the highlights of the<br>year was in fact<br>doing a four day hike from wanaka to<br>queenstown with<br>mba staff actually supported me both<br>professionally and personally<br>so when you talk about professionally i<br>think the guidance that you get from<br>your mentors and from your teachers<br>and the workshop discussions that you<br>have is absolutely amazing<br>mba has helped me to find this job i<br>would say because<br>the main requirement of this job was you<br>need to have an mba because you need to<br>have that basic understanding of what<br>all different technical aspects are<br>there<br>to run the business so i think the<br>knowledge that i gained from it<br>from my mba specifically in strategy and<br>marketing and finance those were like<br>really really important things for me to<br>it turned out to be truly great<br>experience for me here in new zealand<br>i wanted to move into business<br>management specifically product<br>management<br>also i wanted a good work-life balance<br>to go with it coming from a software<br>development background<br>i used to have long hours at work now i<br>have a young family so<br>i want i wanted to get work at a place<br>which has a good work-life balance but<br>also have<br>some new new challenges for me so what i<br>have here<br>sense<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
