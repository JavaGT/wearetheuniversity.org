going to go over to our next<br>panelist who is dr karen matthias<br>corin is a public health physician with<br>a research focus<br>on global mental health corin has worked<br>in india for the last 16 years<br>she will discuss covert 19 and the<br>implications for global mental health<br>katura<br>karan mathias and<br>i'll just get my screen sharing<br>happening<br>um i'm going to talk about<br>global mental health and focusing on<br>the relationship with covert 19 and a<br>focus on equity<br>my work in this area has nearly all been<br>in india so<br>and i've been working there for the last<br>16 years so<br>i'll be using most of my examples from<br>that and i've just<br>completed a study looking at the impacts<br>of code 19 on mental health so i'll also<br>be referring to that<br>um<br>why is mental health important to covert<br>and yeah so um<br>global mental health is important<br>because mental health is one of the<br>largest<br>causes of disability globally and it's<br>particularly important in low and middle<br>income countries<br>so around 32 of the global disease<br>burden<br>is linked to depression and to mental<br>illness<br>but in low middle-income countries it<br>goes up to 85<br>and um it's also important when we look<br>at<br>suicide uh it's one of the second<br>highest causes of death globally among<br>people under 30.<br>so just sort of reminding ourselves and<br>um i've got a photo here<br>of mina who's one of our community<br>health volunteers in the project that<br>i've been directing in the indian<br>himalayas<br>and using face masks is important and<br>i'm using a few illustrations through<br>this presentation<br>of work that teams are doing in<br>communities in low-income countries<br>and with the team that i've been part of<br>i think it's also really important to<br>remember why mental health is important<br>broadly to<br>to all forms of health there's no health<br>without mental health and<br>because if you're not mentally healthy<br>you can't choose healthy behaviors you<br>often don't access services<br>you're not able to work you're not able<br>to participate as an active citizen<br>those are all really important reasons<br>for looking after mental health<br>and mental health interventions are also<br>great value for money which economists<br>and policy makers are happy about and<br>um it's also really important to know<br>that<br>most of the improvements in mental<br>health can happen<br>with psychosocial responses we don't<br>need mental health professionals<br>and um and so those are all good reasons<br>why why we need to really ensure that we<br>focus on mental health<br>in the covert 19 crisis um there's three<br>really strong<br>focuses of mental health and um the<br>first sort of flurry of publications<br>that came out<br>were building on the size epidemic on<br>the<br>foot and mouth epidemic in england<br>and we know that people get an increased<br>incidence of mental health problems<br>and another other just psychosocial<br>conditions in a humanitarian disaster<br>which we're experiencing globally<br>um particularly there are increased<br>rates of depression and anxiety being<br>diagnosed and in conflict<br>settings more post-traumatic stress<br>disorder<br>but the other really important thing is<br>the<br>impacts on access to care and the<br>impacts on people in institutions<br>and clearly the impacts of both the<br>pandemic<br>but also and probably more importantly<br>in most of the world the impacts on the<br>control measures like containment are<br>really significant<br>um for example the project that i've<br>been working with<br>with a large ngo in india the emanuel<br>hospital association<br>we've got around 1200 people with mental<br>illness<br>who have been registered and part of our<br>community-based<br>support and since the outbreak since<br>the start of lockdown in india none of<br>the hospitals have managed to keep their<br>mental health<br>drug supply chains going and so many<br>people with epilepsy and schizophrenia<br>and depression<br>i have been without medicines now for<br>over two months and so this has been a<br>really huge impact and<br>um is largely undocumented<br>some of our community workers have also<br>been involved in supplying rations<br>because a huge impact in india of the<br>lockdown has been<br>um just loss of access to income and<br>um this this headline from the guardian<br>on the<br>um slide here sure is is one that<br>um is alarming and i think all of us<br>probably have<br>experienced some mental health impacts<br>of<br>of the covert 19 outbreak<br>probably all of us have had some times<br>of feeling deep<br>fear in our stomachs um but also<br>just feeling very anxious and this is<br>this is really widespread and so and<br>again there's sort of three levels<br>of where the psychosocial impacts are<br>occurring<br>one is directly in response to the<br>outbreak and we're worried about our<br>family and our own selves and our access<br>to care<br>um in the mission hospital where i was<br>working<br>in march there was a large kind of team<br>meeting about how many<br>ventilators would be kept for staff and<br>how many would be available for<br>patients and these are real concerns um<br>and particularly in settings where<br>there's very little<br>intensive care support but other things<br>that were also<br>that are also really important is the<br>impact on of the<br>control measures so social isolation<br>particularly for<br>families and people who are single<br>family pressures and then the<br>immediate economic impacts and then<br>we're all looking down the barrel of<br>probably quite a number of years of<br>economic impacts<br>and i guess importantly we know that the<br>poorest and the socially excluded will<br>be most<br>impacted<br>this group of women on the right here<br>i was interviewing for another research<br>project<br>last year but they capture a lot of what<br>we understand about the equity issues<br>and i know that some other speakers<br>have referred to these in these already<br>um but these are women who are largely<br>um have had very limited education or<br>are not literate<br>they're female which is by itself a<br>social determinant of poor health they<br>live in a rural area with limited access<br>to health care<br>and they're from a minority ethnic group<br>and<br>this is they typify much of what we see<br>in<br>our mental health globally that there's<br>a strong social gradient<br>but and there's groups who are<br>disproportionately impacted<br>an example of this um is a study that i<br>did a couple of years ago an<br>author of hundred which was looking at<br>risk of depression and<br>we looked at that associated with years<br>of completed education<br>and we can see that people who have<br>completed<br>secondary school education are<br>using them as the reference the people<br>who haven't completed are four times<br>more likely to develop depression<br>and there's a quite strong dose response<br>relationship there<br>related to years of completeness<br>schooling so it's just reminding us that<br>social determinants are insignificant<br>i'm going to just take a few minutes now<br>to talk about a study that i just<br>submitted last week<br>and what we were examining was what are<br>the mental health impacts<br>among disadvantaged groups in north<br>india during the covert lockdown<br>but also what are some of the coping<br>strategies what what are the practices<br>that increase coping and resilience<br>um to do this study we interviewed<br>24 people so i've been in new zealand<br>since<br>the first day of lockdown i arrived back<br>from india<br>and so um i was able to join in some of<br>the interviews by whatsapp<br>and i was working with two colleagues<br>who um<br>conducted the interviews some face to<br>face and some by phone<br>we focus on people with disability and<br>among those were three people who<br>have intellectual disability and we<br>interviewed their carers<br>um eight people living in slums with<br>mental health problems and eight<br>just briefly the area where i've been<br>working and where we did the study is in<br>the state of uttarakhand<br>it's in the hilly indian himalaya<br>the people living there the average<br>poverty level that's higher than that in<br>india there's very very sparse access to<br>mental health services so there's only<br>seven<br>government psychiatrists and six of<br>those are in in two big cities<br>so um and the covered 19<br>situation there is um really rapidly<br>increasing there were<br>91 cases at the start of this month and<br>they're now<br>um yesterday there was 200 2533<br>um the sort of overview of what we found<br>was was that there were the probably the<br>biggest<br>impacts but also the bigger the<br>important levels of response<br>an intrapersonal level people um<br>finding new dimensions between local and<br>global where you're stuck in a very<br>local place but maybe feeling more local<br>globally connected than they had before<br>the social isolation was severe but then<br>that was also<br>using telephones that was the sort of a<br>key strategy for coping<br>and then some really important social<br>and environmental<br>impacts and um coping responses<br>so i'll just go through a couple of<br>these i haven't got time to go through<br>all of them<br>one of them was that feeling bewildered<br>and overwhelmed<br>was a very widespread experience but it<br>was particularly so for people with<br>um less access to telephone to<br>information<br>to mobiles and to tvs and so we had<br>several<br>widows in our who we interviewed who<br>who felt really bewildered they didn't<br>know what was happening and they<br>described having to sort of shout over<br>the gate<br>to their neighbors and ask what's<br>happening and what do i do<br>and this really sort of highlighted the<br>access<br>the sort of technology barriers which<br>exacerbate the inequalities<br>um so that people people without phones<br>particularly<br>didn't know what was going on this quote<br>here from a 40 year old man with<br>disability<br>i i think in a way captures how many of<br>us feel<br>that um from a disease that we didn't<br>had<br>only heard about perhaps in january or<br>late december<br>has now eclipsed everything else and<br>this person says now we have no<br>dengue and malaria and other diseases we<br>used to have in summer there's only one<br>disease and all other diseases have<br>vanished<br>another really important impact that we<br>have<br>observed and i know it's been discussed<br>elsewhere is<br>the social distancing and the risk of<br>contamination and infection has<br>red bred a growing mistrust of others<br>and um i guess that this is particularly<br>evident in india<br>a number of health workers have been not<br>allowed to return to their homes and<br>communities and<br>i was just talking to one of my<br>colleagues yesterday who's been asked by<br>her landlord to move<br>house because she's working with people<br>in slums<br>and because she's coming and going<br>they're saying we don't want you to rent<br>this house anymore<br>um in india there were some very big<br>riots between hindu and muslim<br>people in february and<br>this has added on to that to really<br>increase the kind of communalism<br>and this example here of a 30 year old<br>woman<br>who a hindu woman living in the slum<br>describes that before<br>the her neighbor would say to merida<br>meaning used to be my sister in faith<br>but now saying that we really<br>don't trust each other and we no longer<br>talk to each other so this is a really<br>significant<br>finding another really important impact<br>that we've<br>observed is that the socioeconomic<br>impacts have just been huge for some<br>people<br>and um one some of the particularly the<br>widows that we interviewed<br>were were literally going hungry they<br>this woman described that they only had<br>rice oil and tea leaves<br>that they were hungry and how she'd gone<br>to the market with just one repeat of<br>borrow money<br>and this woman it's really important to<br>understand that the<br>axes of disadvantage compound and so<br>this<br>person who is a woman who is a widow who<br>had a child with a disability who didn't<br>have land and who was illiterate<br>had these kind of compounding events<br>which were<br>leading her to complete despair and i<br>think<br>um this really highlighted to us and and<br>i think it's important for all of us to<br>completely complete understanding the<br>importance of qualitative research and<br>of social sciences<br>when we ask surveys and have our preset<br>questions we don't hear<br>the impacts for people who experience<br>multiple disadvantage<br>if we go on to look at some of the<br>coping measures<br>um there's some really great and<br>creative responses and nearly<br>all of the participants even those in<br>the most desperate situation were also<br>showing great creativity and ways of<br>responding<br>um one really clear<br>area that came out was that natural<br>resources and natural places were<br>solace and places for people to recover<br>and when people were in slums they<br>talked about sitting on the balcony and<br>watching the sunset as being the time<br>they could forget about covet<br>this example here talks about taking the<br>goats grazing to remember that<br>a place is time to remember that kroger<br>isn't happening<br>um there was very much big picture<br>thinking and um people describing that<br>because this event was happening all<br>over the world at the time of these<br>interviews<br>india was um way down and they kind of<br>league table of responses it's now<br>number four<br>but people are saying well the you know<br>even the americans and the europeans<br>they're having a bad time and you know<br>we're all in this together and so i know<br>i need to also cope with it<br>um and this wheelchair user described<br>about i know i've managed in hard times<br>before so i know i can manage now<br>so there's a lot of a lot of really<br>people finding benefit<br>and finding ways to move forward there's<br>a really strong<br>theme that emerged also around coping<br>and the use of<br>communications and mobile phones and how<br>people<br>um this 18 year old said if there were<br>no mobile phones then god knows how<br>people would have kept themselves going<br>and entertained<br>they would have died from missing their<br>um so those are just some of the<br>findings and i guess<br>reflecting on those and on the go<br>ongoing cases and in<br>india the doubling time is around 20<br>um 20 days there's nearly half a million<br>now and<br>it's it's not showing any signs of<br>slowing<br>i think it's really important for us to<br>sort of pay attention to<br>what we can learn from qualitative<br>research and<br>um particularly to listen to and listen<br>you know seek out data to attend to the<br>voices on the edges and the marginalized<br>um to make sure that our responses<br>are inclusive and universal and<br>an example of this is that the um and<br>all the initial acts that came out in<br>india for covert were not<br>usable for people with visual or hearing<br>that it's really important to act with<br>um just some really basic public mental<br>health measures that<br>new zealand has done a great job of<br>implementing by and large<br>but clear messaging honest messaging<br>promoting communication and rather than<br>talking about social distancing<br>focusing on physical distancing but<br>staying<br>staying in touch with people i think<br>really important<br>to ensure that the most excluded and<br>most disadvantaged are<br>most able to access support and<br>addressing stigma<br>these are already key measures and and<br>haven't been happening<br>enough in many countries i think another<br>really important idea is that in times<br>of peace<br>we need to have really strong structures<br>so that we can then move forward and so<br>if people have got in communities have<br>skills for psychosocial care<br>um to look to know how to look after<br>themselves then there's a better chance<br>of being well<br>in the situation like an epidemic<br>this is a really great resource at who i<br>think sort of fast-tracked it just came<br>out in<br>may but it's an illustrated guide it's<br>very simple language and gives really<br>great ideas on how to<br>manage stress and respond and look after<br>yourself in times of stress and it<br>really focuses on<br>psychosocial skills which you can use at<br>home<br>it's not dependent on professionals or<br>medicines<br>so um just as i wrap up some of the<br>responses that i think are really<br>important to see in global mental health<br>and there's been some really useful<br>lunch articles identifying what are the<br>you know big<br>information needs that we need to<br>include in mental health and one of<br>these<br>is that when we use co-productive and<br>participatory methods to generate<br>knowledge<br>and to implement plans there's a much<br>higher chance that<br>the knowledge is is useful relevant and<br>acceptable<br>um addressing equity is is really<br>essential and who we have in our teams<br>and where they live and what their<br>experiences is<br>something that we've been finding in our<br>community development and mental health<br>work in india is really<br>important um but also to really<br>avoid deficit type thinking where we<br>only describe negative impacts<br>because there are resources and assets<br>in each<br>setting um<br>a lot of funding decisions are made you<br>know in delhi or in wellington or in<br>washington and it's really important to<br>and what we're finding is that the<br>people in local context they're<br>very different experiences it's<br>important to recognize those<br>i think the whole outbreak that is<br>you know for inclusion and anti-racism<br>has been really important<br>and totally wrapped up with the cobot 19<br>outbreak<br>particularly linked to george floyd's<br>murder<br>and um so i think recognizing the<br>importance of social determinants<br>and again looking out for those in the<br>ways that we do our research<br>ensuring that data is desegregated<br>just to close this is a really great<br>opinion piece that was in the journal of<br>the american medical association last<br>month<br>and i i think it captures a lot of what<br>all of us working<br>um to respond to covert need to think<br>about<br>with much bigger picture and social<br>determinants and equity<br>kind of right on our foreheads i'll just<br>read it aloud<br>um the work of a physician as a healer<br>cannot stop at the door of an office<br>or threshold of an operating room or the<br>front gate of a hospital<br>the rescue of a society and the<br>restoration of a political ethos that<br>remembers to heal<br>have also become physicians jobs<br>professional science silence<br>in the face of social injustice is wrong<br>so um i'll wrap up there i'm looking<br>forward to some questions<br>and yeah i just hope that we can all<br>keep<br>mental health right at the front of our<br>covered<br>um response and research and programs<br>thanks thank you karen<br>a few questions that have come in um the<br>first one<br>are these findings from india applicable<br>internationally<br>for example in new zealand or in other<br>um i guess global mental health is<br>something that<br>tries to look at what's the<br>features of mental health and what's<br>happening and so i think these findings<br>are very relevant<br>the experiences of disadvantaged<br>communities<br>where they have low resources um in<br>north india<br>are very similar to many other<br>disadvantaged and nominal income<br>settings<br>they're maybe not um you know there's<br>not a perfect match over to high income<br>settings like new zealand but the ideas<br>of coping skills that build on existing<br>psychosocial resources<br>um is very much something that happens<br>all the world over because we're all<br>absolutely here's a rather big question<br>in your opinion what do you think<br>governments could do to improve the<br>mental health<br>of populations in south asian countries<br>oh this is a favorite topic of mine i<br>think that um<br>my personal view i very strongly believe<br>that building and supporting<br>psychosocial resources and skills in<br>communities is really key<br>and i think building knowledge and<br>awareness is important<br>and doing developing those resources in<br>co-productive ways that are<br>relevant and contextually useful is<br>central<br>i think developing safe social spaces<br>and allowing dialogue around mental<br>health is really important and so<br>yeah the role of stigma and social<br>exclusion is really important<br>access to care is important and care<br>providers<br>who are good at i think that<br>who can understand sort of different<br>explanatory frameworks and<br>a more pluralist understanding people<br>in the communities where i've been<br>working are very<br>able to visit a traditional healer while<br>they take<br>their fluoxetine and while they also<br>you know follow follow the advice of a<br>local iv fluid merchant and so<br>i think um dua or dawa which is a term<br>used often in south asia which means<br>prayers and medicine is a really good<br>approach rather than<br>saying you know very strictly biomedical<br>approach it's okay to<br>embrace traditional healers input and<br>recognize that you know it's all mental<br>health is quite large and complex and so<br>it's okay to um engage with other sort<br>of systems of healing<br>um and i guess that the third area<br>that i think is really important is<br>group work and psychosocial support<br>groups<br>have got really good evidence and so<br>we're<br>in um i guess western or high income<br>settings<br>and one-to-one therapy predominates we<br>actually have found<br>better responses in group therapy and<br>i think that's probably quite relevant<br>for other community groups in<br>new zealand as well that we could do<br>well to respond whether<br>maybe a less individualistic western<br>response but to look at the whanau<br>and te fari topafa type approaches which<br>are<br>looking at the kind of whole person in<br>interesting insights thank you we have a<br>few minutes left and<br>no more questions have come through so<br>that's why we give it a few moments<br>are there any parts of your presentation<br>you'd like to give a bit more attention<br>to or any additional insights you'd like<br>to share<br>while we get a few more questions<br>through<br>well i guess that one thing that um<br>is really keen to focus on<br>is looking at the ways that people<br>use connectivity and so one one of the<br>biggest<br>um impacts that we were described by<br>participants<br>was in the research that we did was a<br>feeling of social isolation and that<br>they weren't able to use their normal<br>ways of connecting to other people so um<br>i guess social connectedness by itself<br>is a health determinant<br>but particularly the ways that people<br>could talk or communicate<br>changed but there's also these really<br>sort of innovative ways where people<br>described<br>you know and we saw this in new zealand<br>people standing at the end of driveways<br>or um talking over the fence through the<br>window to neighbors<br>and that drive to connect to other<br>people<br>seemed really really critical<br>particularly at this time of crisis<br>and so i think how to facilitate that<br>in policy and in programs and to<br>innovation of of humankind to allow that<br>to prosper it's something that would be<br>really great to kind of support with<br>technology as well<br>thank you and uh our last question um<br>is a comment as well coryn this is such<br>an amazing webinar so thank you for that<br>thank you so much for your wisdom and<br>encouragement to move away from a<br>deficit model<br>do you have any comment relating to dr<br>hall's concern about<br>child and youth mental health in new<br>um i think that<br>i've i'm doing quite a lot of work<br>around youth<br>mental health and youth and i guess that<br>one of the biggest things i feel like<br>is um i i really have not worked in<br>in new zealand for some years so i don't<br>feel i'm competent to respond<br>on the status of child and youth mental<br>health in new zealand<br>but to underline that it is<br>it is really core to the well-being of<br>the community<br>is something really important and um<br>we've been working with a group of young<br>women in a<br>slum in daradoon a city near where i've<br>been living<br>and they have they have just<br>had so many insightful ideas on how to<br>respond we had this amazing<br>event where an 18 year old hindu woman<br>joined together with the 24 year old<br>muslim woman and they went to the local<br>sikh<br>temple and they provided food for 30<br>families<br>twice a day over a week and they did all<br>the collecting food they went around the<br>community collecting food and<br>the sort of levels of energy and<br>innovation that young people show is<br>just<br>so critical that i i really would love<br>to find ways that new zealand was<br>better at allowing youth voices to be at<br>the table in<br>policy making and research design<br>and in program implementation so i i<br>guess that sort of co-production<br>approach is something that i would<br>really love you know all people<br>everywhere to<br>to do better thank you<br>we're probably about out of time but<br>there's one quick question that's come<br>through<br>can we be first world and developed but<br>i hope so i think um<br>i think that one of just one of the very<br>strong things<br>just going back to this research that we<br>did was just this amazing<br>thing that has happened with covert<br>where a lot of us have been more local<br>than we've ever been in our lives you<br>know<br>staying in a you know sort of one meet<br>one kilometer radius of our homes and in<br>the whole world over that has been an<br>experience but<br>more globally connected to the<br>experience of being human and so i think<br>this is another of the opportunities of<br>covert if we choose to take it and run<br>with it so<br>um how that happens i guess we don't<br>have time to discuss but i<br>i think it's one of the amazing<br>opportunities of covert<br>thanks dee thank you and that's all we<br>have time for today so thanks once again<br>to karen and tony for their<br>presentations and insights<br>we will be back again tomorrow and as<br>i'm sure you're aware our first speaker<br>at 12 noon tomorrow will be dr ashley<br>bloomfield</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
