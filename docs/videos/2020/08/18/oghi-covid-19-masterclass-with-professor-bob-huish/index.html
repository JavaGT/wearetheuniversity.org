there he is associate professor bob<br>hughish<br>bobby's coming to us from dalhousie<br>university in canada<br>bob is associate professor of<br>international development studies at<br>dalhousie<br>and his presentation will focus on<br>fighting kerbert 19<br>cuba's important contribution thanks bob<br>thank you jackie if it's possible i'd<br>love to share my screen<br>see if we can get you some technical<br>so jackie just uh please let me know<br>when i've i've got this sorted out<br>you should see a an island coming up<br>here in a minute<br>there it is and now you should see<br>the opening slide thanks dog<br>okay we're good great so thanks again<br>everybody for<br>inviting me to this this fantastic event<br>of course it would have been great to be<br>there in person with you all<br>but uh we're all used to the to the zoom<br>meetings by now i'm sure<br>because of this pandemic that we have<br>found ourselves in<br>and we we'd look at the state<br>of the cases around the globe today and<br>what i want to show<br>you today is uh what is cuba doing and<br>why does cuba matter<br>so i'm afraid it's going to be a<br>departure from any strict medical<br>biology on this presentation<br>more into the social sciences and the<br>social and political geography<br>of the virus more broadly but one of the<br>things that<br>that's really important when looking at<br>the politics of this virus<br>is is the united states which is right<br>now<br>experiencing an uptick in cases<br>we've seen just the entire urban<br>landscape of places like new york city<br>cleared out during the initial stages of<br>covet 19<br>and meanwhile other countries have been<br>quite used to<br>their political leaders coming out daily<br>at set hours here in canada it's<br>it's 11 o'clock in the morning when<br>prime minister trudeau joins us to give<br>us a daily up<br>you know update i understand in new<br>zealand jason ardern has<br>been similarly following suit and<br>this sort of public information and<br>trying to stay safe during the pandemic<br>has been widely applauded by many around<br>the world<br>countries that have chosen to do this<br>and one country not only has done that<br>very very well<br>but has also sent 2 300 of their own<br>health workers to<br>other countries who have been struggling<br>with this pandemic<br>and that of course is cuba what makes<br>the cuban case even more interesting<br>is its relationship with the largest<br>well the largest stream the largest<br>economy in the world the united states<br>and it's not only handling of the<br>coronavirus<br>but also its relationship to cuba during<br>this time<br>we've seen the actions by president<br>trump<br>daily they become more absurd<br>as the cases today as we see the the<br>line in the united states continues to<br>increase headlines in the united states<br>look something like this<br>coronavirus updates florida cases spike<br>dl hewley collapses on stage arizona<br>sheriff who test positive<br>won't wear masks and over the weekend<br>here we see one of the largest bumps<br>in the state of florida where in june 15<br>there are 1700<br>1700 58 cases which is now up to 4049<br>as of june 20th meanwhile 90 miles south<br>of florida is cuba which has four<br>remaining cases<br>left so not only is cuba a case worth<br>discussing<br>for how it handled cobit 19 within its<br>own borders but<br>how it actually dealt with other<br>countries during this process<br>and again i have to flip back to what's<br>going on in the white house right now<br>where we see the cases of white house<br>staff<br>using racist and derogatory terms the<br>photo<br>of president trump who stroke out<br>the word covid or coronavirus from his<br>speaking notes and replaced it with the<br>word chinese<br>and and in light of that the cdc having<br>very active campaigns<br>to try to reduce stigma it's a very<br>political<br>uh environment about how this has been<br>been taken on and<br>the united states actions i don't think<br>can be ignored<br>during this time there's been lots of<br>issues lately of the protests going on<br>in the united states that also included<br>three weeks ago<br>of course armed protesters coming into<br>the state capitol in michigan<br>declined that they needed their their<br>freedom to go out and explore the<br>country and get haircuts<br>once again so why do i bring this up<br>for the following points right now we're<br>facing the largest pandemic in history<br>in an era of tremendous inequality and<br>foreign aid to global health reveals<br>deep<br>and troubling moral foundations to<br>international cooperation<br>and health so our responses to coven 19<br>pandemics reveal<br>these inequalities and it invites<br>conversations about the deeper<br>inequalities of health care and foreign<br>aid and cooperation more broadly<br>so this is why the place of cuba's<br>medical internationalism for global<br>health emergencies is a very telling<br>example<br>of how we could do things differently<br>and again<br>flying in the face of what's coming out<br>of washington right now with just poor<br>management within the us<br>and even poor foreign policy backing it<br>up so<br>can we put well-being at the forefront<br>of global health policy<br>this is what i want to talk to you about<br>but really a simple question and i'm<br>sure most people<br>could could be you know be able to<br>answer this very quickly<br>but if i was to ask you can you define<br>health<br>could you do it if you look it up in the<br>dictionary if you have a iphone in front<br>of you you can ask<br>siri what uh what is the definition of<br>health<br>and she'll probably tell you that it's<br>stated being free from illness or injury<br>now the problem with that definition of<br>health is that it actually<br>is deeply embedded in a lot of our<br>international policy and public health<br>strategies about being free of illness<br>or injury<br>it's something that's defining health<br>for which it is not<br>not being illness it's the same sort of<br>thing if you were to ask<br>siri what's the definition of an apple<br>it would give you a very detailed<br>description of a tree fruit from the<br>rose family<br>it wouldn't describe an apple as not<br>an orange so the thing is is that we're<br>often<br>dealing with health in many<br>jurisdictions as approaching it as a<br>state of being<br>free from illness or injury rather<br>than what has been a long agreed upon<br>approach about looking at health as a<br>state of complete mental and social<br>well-being<br>and to do it in this way of course there<br>has to be appreciation for the social<br>determinants of health<br>right recognizing both the upstream and<br>the downstream<br>determinants of health the downstream<br>ones of course are those that<br>have a more immediate impact on<br>individuals health conditions individual<br>lifestyle factors social and community<br>networks<br>those we can define in that sense but<br>the upstream ones<br>the the general social economic cultural<br>and environmental conditions that<br>influence<br>living and working conditions employment<br>water sanitation health care access<br>those are the ones that really count in<br>times of pandemics especially in a time<br>of global inequality<br>when it comes to health back to<br>manhattan here you see right here in<br>times<br>square stay sick when you are home okay<br>that's a great idea only that<br>in the united states much of the the<br>health care services there just aren't<br>equipped to deal with the sort of a<br>condition you've got some 28 million<br>americans<br>who are uninsured you have some 11<br>million people who<br>are undocumented workers in the country<br>you had another<br>15 million americans who lost their<br>health insurance<br>during the coven 19 pandemic because of<br>because of layoffs<br>and on top of that we can recognize that<br>almost one in every two bankruptcies<br>that occur in the united states occur<br>due to health care related<br>costs so we are seeing again in a<br>country that<br>is not well equipped to deal with the<br>upstream determinants of health<br>it's not surprising that you see such<br>poor<br>support of and adherence to<br>social distancing self-isolation<br>sheltering in place orders<br>all of which are very antiquated forms<br>of public health interventions that that<br>date back to antiquity<br>uh you know here in canada and of course<br>in new zealand as well<br>the the the guidelines that have been<br>set out that team effort to social<br>distance and to save lives and to stay<br>home<br>this sort of behavior is better equipped<br>when you've got<br>the resources to help people do it in<br>the united states<br>they're not there so you see hoarding at<br>the costco whole<br>wholesale and likewise in resource poor<br>countries like<br>india when there's shelter in place<br>orders put into<br>spots in mumbai where up to 23 000<br>people can be condensed into a square<br>kilometer<br>it's not a policy that people can easily<br>adhere to<br>and in these countries we're still<br>seeing the uptick of covet 19.<br>so what is it about cuba well simply put<br>it in itself is a healthcare system that<br>works with the<br>upstream determinants of health within<br>its own borders<br>and that allows it to build capacity to<br>help<br>other countries around the world so of<br>course<br>we've heard the stories about cuban<br>doctors heading to italy<br>when there was the serious overwhelming<br>of the health care services<br>there during the early stages of the<br>pandemic<br>but we've heard less about the fact that<br>cuban doctors have gone<br>to some 23 other countries during the<br>coven 19 pandemic<br>just for a coven response and that<br>doesn't even get into the detail<br>of the fact that you've got some 36 000<br>cuban health workers<br>in about 60 countries who are already<br>there beforehand<br>lending services so<br>i'm a geographer i have a trade union<br>obligation to put up a map or a globe so<br>here it is and when we talk about cuba's<br>involvement<br>in global politics we see that<br>the regional focus has usually been here<br>in<br>the the americas cuba's sent health care<br>workers to every single country<br>in south america and central america<br>since 1961<br>but more and more there's an expansion<br>about where cuba is lending its efforts<br>politically it's not just an influence<br>of saying it's health for the americas<br>but even here in the south pacific<br>even in kiribati right<br>something that would take you four days<br>to travel from cuba to<br>to get to when the pandemic wasn't on<br>there are cuban medical staff present<br>in that country now if you want to know<br>more details about the extent<br>of cuba's global influence not just in<br>the pacific or south america but also<br>in the african continent feel free to<br>check out this title<br>where no doctor has gone before if you<br>need a 25<br>discount on that let me know can be<br>arranged but it talks about a<br>long-standing history<br>of cuban doctors working in areas around<br>the world where other physicians just<br>haven't gone or in systems that have<br>furthered<br>inequality and thereby the cubans come<br>in to try to<br>lessen that burden and one of the things<br>about this policy is unique as it is<br>that you've got an<br>economically humble nation in the<br>caribbean<br>that's providing this this global health<br>outreach and by the<br>thousands it seems extraordinary but in<br>fact it's grounded in a<br>very well versed<br>concept of solidarity about sharing the<br>practices about shared practices<br>reflecting a collective<br>commitment to carry the cost to assist<br>others<br>that's the basis of cuba's foreign<br>policy and health<br>this understanding implies a level of<br>agency to participate in solidarity<br>and also the participant can receive<br>benefit<br>and as well solidarity is less<br>transactional in terms of cost versus<br>benefit or donor versus recipient<br>instead it implies a collective<br>participation in the practice itself<br>basically it's saying we're going to<br>engage in foreign policy based on<br>problems<br>not on threats or enemies but on<br>collective<br>problems and why does it matter to<br>health<br>because it does not succumb to the<br>limits of charity a lot of our global<br>health outreach<br>is through charitable means which is<br>helpful it can save lives<br>but it's often by the will of the donor<br>and it cannot be broad enough to replace<br>entire health systems especially in low<br>resource settings<br>and unlike altruism solidarity creates a<br>mutual benefit through partnership<br>it's not an exceptional act it's a it's<br>a normative act<br>where two partners deal and work with<br>each other<br>in order to address this collective<br>action and it's not<br>forced responsibility but it's chosen<br>action<br>so it's not saying that there's an<br>obligation to<br>to participate in this it's by mutual<br>bilateral cooperation where it comes<br>together<br>and you see it throughout the cuban<br>landscape such as here<br>the latin american school of medicine<br>which has<br>effectively transformed global health<br>education for many persons<br>in the global south so why does cuba<br>matter when it comes to pandemics and to<br>global health<br>more broadly cuba's shown that this<br>commitment to health<br>is part of development not necessarily a<br>product<br>from it and while many transitional<br>economies have de-invested in health and<br>education<br>cuba even despite economic hardship<br>doesn't do that<br>and medical internationalism has played<br>an important economic and political role<br>in the covet 19 pandemic and it builds<br>on a long tradition<br>of helping other nations one of the<br>things that you see<br>within cuba is this very deep commitment<br>to the training of healthcare workers<br>so medical doctors for example<br>uh you you've got 1960s you have<br>cuba and canada in the united states the<br>united kingdom<br>all about the same level in terms of the<br>doctor-to-patient ratio it's medical<br>doctors<br>on the up and down side and gross<br>domestic product on the bottom<br>and if we start moving this over the<br>years<br>you see that there's a bit of a<br>stammering in cuba to get going and<br>training health workers<br>the rich countries are able to produce<br>medical schools and to recruit<br>foreigners to come into their systems<br>but cuba in the 1980s despite complete<br>economic hardship and then a total<br>collapse of their economy<br>wind up training more doctors per capita<br>than any other country on the planet<br>whereby their doctor patient ratio is<br>about one for every 144 people<br>and as you can see they found a benefit<br>not just for themselves<br>but for the world that when cuba sends<br>36 000 health care workers<br>to 68 countries the impact at home<br>isn't severe it comes back to the early<br>stages<br>of approaching health well-being land<br>reform<br>education these were the early<br>principles of what was going on in<br>cuba's revolution in the early 1960s<br>medical education elementary education<br>phd education it's all in the house if<br>you are a cuban citizen<br>one of the things that cuba had in the<br>early 1950s was only three medical<br>schools two of them were really<br>well really only one functioned well the<br>other two were<br>kind of haphazard but that was for the<br>entire nation<br>today there are 23 allopathic medical<br>schools<br>across the country it's one in every<br>province and then<br>more of a concentration in the capital<br>actually outstripping the number of<br>medical schools that canada has canada<br>only has 18<br>and the number of doctors at cuba can<br>graduate every year<br>up to 6500 whereby canada<br>has got about 2 800. and even in the<br>early days<br>this is the first medical team that cuba<br>dispatched over to algeria in 1963 even<br>when the country itself was struggling<br>to find resources at home they still<br>sent cooperation efforts abroad<br>just a brief list you see some of the<br>the countries on there like nicaragua in<br>the 70s<br>was no political ally of cuba and yet<br>they<br>they continued to send doctors abroad<br>to where they were requested and where<br>they were needed<br>and the real mystery that's solved here<br>is is this part here where you see this<br>economic collapse where the<br>essential collapse of the soviet union<br>led to economic hardship<br>in cuba as opposed to many countries<br>that de-invested<br>from their their welfare state during<br>hardship cuba actually bumped it up<br>there<br>the schools may have been falling apart<br>there may have been very serious health<br>issues<br>during those years in cuba but they did<br>not close a single medical school<br>they did not close a single hospital and<br>they didn't<br>they increased enrollment and offered<br>further scholarships<br>they also adopted something called a<br>poly clinic which was a 1970s approach<br>to to medicine that wasn't really<br>popular but then was revisited<br>in the 90s that basically created these<br>health areas both in urban<br>and rural areas that allowed everyone to<br>get access<br>to these smaller scale clinics<br>and these clinics offer a wide range of<br>services electrocardiograms allergy<br>clinics<br>x-rays surgery urgent care trauma center<br>pharmacy you name it all within a<br>10-minute walk of most houses<br>in havana what that was coupled with was<br>this idea about deep interaction<br>between the health system and people<br>that it wasn't just about maintaining<br>health of an individual<br>it was also about maintaining health of<br>a population<br>and as a result you see quite a bit of<br>strength within these poly clinics<br>in in cuba so for a population of 27<br>000 you've got 114 physicians 87 nurses<br>137 technicians social workers 106<br>and then about 71 students that work in<br>clinics like this<br>is it basic you bet is the water potable<br>yes does the air conditioning work yes<br>are the bed sheets cleaned<br>they are does the ultrasound work it<br>does<br>does the x-ray work yes it does<br>and even during the the hard times in<br>the 1990s<br>if you look at cuba's health data there<br>everything went up<br>every single indicator uh went up<br>during those years and we could go<br>through a long list that<br>we're probably running a little tight on<br>time so i don't want to get too far into<br>it<br>but even life expectancy you see<br>you know cuba by the 1970s<br>basically being on par with the more<br>resource-fleshed nations like<br>the uk in the united states during that<br>time<br>so as a result of the strength cuba has<br>its medical break brigades<br>these have been running since the 1960s<br>and it's been about focusing on primary<br>care<br>building public health infrastructure<br>having community-based routines of<br>prevention and health promotion<br>and sharing the financial responsibility<br>so when<br>the hurricanes come through the the<br>caribbean cuba has a dispatch team about<br>187 physicians and specialists<br>ready to deploy within 48 hours such as<br>here in haiti<br>so the cuban response in haiti was very<br>impressive they set up a field hospital<br>very quickly and there it is there's the<br>the hospital that was that was set up in<br>the capitol<br>and when some 2000 physicians came to<br>haiti<br>to provide care after the earthquake in<br>this case<br>they offered 2 000 scholarships for<br>haitian students to study<br>in cuba in order to provide long-term<br>care in the future<br>other programs they've offered has been<br>this the mission milagro<br>campaign which has restored eyesight to<br>1.8 million of latin americans<br>poor using cooperated funds from<br>norway and taiwan and venezuela during<br>the time<br>these cataract surgeries were were given<br>free for all<br>during the um during the early 2000s if<br>to 2020<br>these guys here were taxi drivers from<br>st lucia<br>this was their health team those were<br>the surgeons and<br>nurses and there's a fellow here from<br>mexico who's having a degenerative eye<br>problem and his mother brought him to<br>cuba<br>all free of charge to to do eye care<br>during this time<br>uh so this is the sort of capacity that<br>that cuba has and there's<br>lots of cases 2400 care workers going to<br>pakistan for 13 months<br>after an earthquake there sometimes<br>using very simple methods like<br>sticks and rubber boots and walking into<br>the rural areas where helicopters<br>couldn't land<br>and of course the last time we had a<br>pandemic where the threat<br>of the pandemic was the ebola crisis in<br>west africa where<br>despite repeated calls for human<br>resources for health cuba did answer the<br>call<br>with 465 health workers they transformed<br>a military base into a 200 bed ebola<br>hospital they trained local health<br>workers they expanded<br>public health and education campaigns<br>and they offered ebola training to help<br>professionals and coordinators<br>from 19 countries for free<br>so when you stack this up covet 19<br>isn't exactly a new or scary phenomena<br>for cuba<br>it is its business as usual take care of<br>yourselves<br>through an upstream approach provide the<br>social resources<br>within the nation to make it work and<br>then help those<br>who need it the most so when you look at<br>cuba's coven 19 assistance it stacks up<br>like this<br>2300 cuban health workers volunteered in<br>24 countries<br>the european countries such as italy<br>spain<br>and dora they received cuban assistance<br>uh you have resource-strained countries<br>like south africa and mexico<br>they've received cuban assistance for<br>covid19 in assistance to primary care<br>support as well and this against a<br>backdrop of some 28 thousand cubans<br>already working overseas<br>cuba as of today only has four active<br>cases of covet 19<br>and against a backdrop of one of the<br>strictest<br>economic embargoes in history which is<br>why i mentioned the us<br>why why the u.s at a time when they<br>can't get kova 19<br>under control within their own borders<br>the trump white house is taking active<br>steps<br>to discourage other countries from<br>receiving cuban assistance during this<br>crisis<br>that was the case in brazil<br>ordered the expulsion of cuban doctors<br>from the program mais<br>magikos which was operating in the<br>northeastern part of the country and<br>then<br>in bolivia janine anez who is the<br>interim president there<br>ordered the removal of cuban doctors<br>from rural areas in the country within<br>48 hours<br>of her taking power and again why<br>and this doesn't let up from one of the<br>most relentless embargoes<br>uh in in modern history so<br>why solidarity and well-being for cuba<br>it's because health is a process of<br>development in cuba<br>the investment in health in cuba just<br>merely follows an internationally<br>recognized<br>best practices a lot of what they do is<br>based on international guidelines and<br>being an active member of the who<br>it circumvents traditional aid<br>structures the donor driven foreign aid<br>has come with many pitfalls from reverse<br>capital flow to dependency issues<br>cuba's bilateral solidarity avoids this<br>and it demonstrates improved health and<br>political benefits<br>the numbers are very telling cuban<br>health workers have made transformative<br>improvements<br>in resource poor settings around the<br>world while gaining political clout<br>as a result naturally so it's a pivot<br>in foreign policy and global health will<br>nations continue to<br>approach threat-based foreign policy<br>during and after the pandemic<br>the united states probably will much of<br>the system is structured to respond to<br>immediate threats and enemies<br>and will nations work towards<br>problem-based foreign policy<br>is this a moment to pivot our security<br>imaginations away from borders bandits<br>and benevolence to more universal<br>problems like good health and<br>climate change adaption and how would we<br>measure benefit from a new approach to<br>international engagement<br>that's really the question all these<br>examples that i've given you here<br>are are notable but if this is going to<br>have a take<br>on international policy or within global<br>health systems going forward<br>the cuban case needs to be given<br>attention because it's<br>telling as it demonstrates how mutual<br>benefit can emerge<br>through health based foreign policy and<br>cooperation unfortunately my final point<br>is that you're seeing that language<br>adopted around the world cook islands<br>says well-being over economic gains i<br>don't have to tell you about new zealand<br>do you know it well<br>and of course iceland finland and other<br>countries that are starting to<br>bring the terms of well-being forward<br>into both their domestic<br>and foreign budgets so that's me that's<br>uh<br>thank you for tuning in to that if you<br>do want to hear more about cuba's<br>role in international foreign policy or<br>what's going on here in canada<br>tune in to the global development primer<br>it's a podcast that i run here from<br>dalhousie university<br>thank you bob we've got about five<br>minutes for questions and we have two<br>questions that have come through which<br>are very similar<br>first one doesn't cuban cuba often get<br>paid for providing doctors to other<br>countries<br>and our second question which is related<br>deals with<br>cuba having done very well with health<br>indicators but what about human rights<br>in the country<br>particularly with regard to the rights<br>of doctors<br>sure the first one yes there's actually<br>three<br>economic models that cuba engages its<br>cooperation with<br>the first one is bilateral so that is<br>when one country requests<br>cuban assistance uh cuban physicians<br>then get paid a stipend for being<br>overseas<br>as part of that and the cuban state<br>itself often receives<br>financial benefit from that as well so<br>you've got that in that way<br>the second way that cuba offers<br>assistance is through<br>through multilateral organizations so if<br>the world health<br>organization or the pan-american health<br>organization<br>is offering contracts they will broker<br>the funds and often<br>open those contracts to physicians from<br>from the broader region to which cuba<br>participates in funds go back to the<br>physicians and they go back<br>to the uh to the state itself and the<br>third way<br>of doing it is by uh trilateral<br>cooperation so<br>in countries like haiti in countries<br>like the gambia<br>where there's just no means to pay for<br>these these these expenses<br>of of health care third-party<br>partnerships come out so<br>norway has gotten involved taiwan has<br>gotten involved you're actually seeing<br>some assistance with fiji and new<br>zealand with the cuban brigades that<br>have worked in the pacific<br>over the past couple of years so those<br>are the ways that they they mitigate<br>costs<br>human rights about doctors i<br>i'm curious about that myself<br>if there's a specific charge that wants<br>to be<br>shared i'm happy to retort to that but<br>i'm not going to speculate on things<br>that can't be proven thanks bob<br>uh one last question do you know if the<br>bill and melinda gates foundation have<br>any relationship with cuba<br>no unfortunately they don't um it's very<br>limited and i think it's because of that<br>conflict<br>that you see between between the donor<br>driven model<br>and the bilateral state to state uh<br>functioning where there's been some<br>really encouraging<br>partnerships between between cuba and<br>partners in the north it's actually been<br>through john hopkins university<br>and two other universities in the united<br>states that have actually worked<br>on vaccine development and for that<br>if by the late stages of these vaccines<br>going to trials there could have been<br>the potential to get organizations like<br>gates involved but right now there's not<br>thank you we have one last question a<br>quick one<br>one of our panelists one of our<br>attendees is asked<br>regarding the debate around the quality<br>of the cuban doctors in terms of their<br>quality of care can you make any comment<br>on that bob<br>yeah no i get this one a little bit and<br>what i can say is that it's<br>it's a very it's an excellent<br>system of health for what it is trying<br>to do the goals are to keep people<br>healthy<br>the goals are to keep populations<br>healthy so for that the system functions<br>incredibly well and i would argue better<br>than most<br>systems in in even affluent countries<br>that do have universal health care<br>especially when it comes down to that<br>that maintenance and improvement of<br>population individual health<br>where it struggles is where you're<br>looking at<br>advanced medications that aren't able to<br>be developed within the country or<br>you're looking at advanced surgical<br>procedures<br>that are only found in in more affluent<br>places and the two reasons for that<br>of course come back down to just the<br>economic state that you see in cuba<br>and then also the the embargo from the<br>united states which strictly prohibits<br>the importation<br>of medical equipment and medicines into<br>cuba<br>so in that way if you've got global<br>brigades of<br>of physicians that are willing to work<br>in resource poor settings<br>to to help support initiatives like this<br>in a pandemic<br>and even those in in affluent settings<br>who can can help coordinate population<br>health<br>thanks very much associate professor bob<br>that's all we have time for there our<br>next speaker is going to be coming</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
