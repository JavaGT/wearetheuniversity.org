audio<br>visual set up here today<br>we're not expecting any technical<br>difficulty difficulties<br>but if there are any please bear with us<br>today's webinar is going to run for one<br>hour<br>so we'll be finishing at around about 1<br>pm new zealand time<br>just a reminder that the master class<br>webinars are all being recorded<br>and will also be available on the ongi<br>website later<br>we're also live streaming through the<br>auggie facebook page<br>during the webinars each speaker will<br>present their presentation<br>and you can ask questions at any time<br>through the q

in suva fiji<br>we have a very tight schedule of<br>webinars so if we're not able to get to<br>all the questions<br>we will ask our speakers to provide<br>written responses which we'll then post<br>our first speaker this morning is dr<br>sharma das who is in the school of<br>pharmacy at the university of otago<br>dr dos is going to talk about the<br>university of otago<br>for the invitation to speak and<br>disconfirms<br>i am a pulmonary drug delivery scientist<br>coffee 19 but as primarily attacks<br>belong<br>i was contracted by few academics and<br>industries<br>to conduct research on developing<br>inhalers of drugs<br>and vaccines for commute<br>meanwhile my team has voluntarily<br>taken time to produce and sanitizer<br>during this lockdown period to help<br>essential services<br>and the community i am sharing this<br>story<br>while the world is waiting for vaccines<br>and treatment<br>available for kovite one of the current<br>strategies<br>is to reduce the transmission of this<br>virus<br>and hygiene plays a key role<br>in reducing this transmission<br>hand sanitizer we also call it hand<br>drops<br>are commonly used for hand hygiene<br>because they offer improved compliance<br>due to portability ease of use<br>and suitability for use in areas with<br>lack of accessibility to sinks or other<br>they also offer increased safety and<br>better tolerance<br>than other products therefore<br>constrict hazard becomes an essential<br>community<br>during this pandemic i also want to buy<br>some hand sanitizer in donating<br>but all i found is this out of stock<br>and this sort of shocking news<br>in the otago daily times<br>fact there was an acute shortness of<br>hand sanitizer<br>all over the world including the us<br>and europe you can see even the<br>parliament<br>in europe it was discussed what we chose<br>to do<br>um help the community<br>with constantine<br>as a part of pharmacy curriculum we<br>learned<br>to prepare a solution and now we<br>also teach to our undergraduate students<br>so we know how to prepare a solution<br>i immediately decided that i would be<br>preparing hansen<br>kalja and help the community during this<br>family<br>in fact i had two options either to<br>serve the community<br>with our expertise or stay home<br>i discussed this idea with all my<br>students<br>with my research students and all were<br>so excited<br>to contribute to this project<br>so i got a team and then<br>um the real<br>production thinking<br>resource for hamster ethanol we found<br>that there are<br>two types of hand sanitizer currently in<br>the market<br>alcohol free and alcohol-based<br>they are coming as a liquid or<br>a gel or a phone alcohol based hand<br>drops are considered<br>to be the most uh effective hand<br>sanitizer<br>with first antimicrobial efficacy<br>ease of use and good normal tolerance<br>non-alcoholic preparations are also<br>available<br>where they have active engines like<br>povidone<br>iodine or chlorohexidine gluconate<br>we found that the world health<br>organization has a guideline<br>for local production of two uh<br>hand drop formulations one is ethanol<br>based<br>and the other one is iso profile based<br>we decided to prepare<br>ethanol based hand sanitizer because<br>ethanol was<br>and gradients we used are alcohol<br>hydrogen peroxide and glycerol<br>alcohol is the active substance it<br>unfolds<br>the and inactivates proteins and kills a<br>broad spectrum of microorganisms<br>very quickly it has minimum risk of<br>developing resistance to antimicrobial<br>elements<br>we also use hydrogen peroxide which<br>inactivates contaminating bacterial<br>spores<br>in the solution and finally we also used<br>a glycerol<br>which is a human tent this reduces the<br>loss of moisture from hand<br>and helps it enhance moist<br>it increases the acceptability of the<br>product<br>we needed funding so i um<br>discussed this idea with our dean<br>professor columera<br>who approved our initial funding later<br>on the university covet fund<br>actually gave us all the<br>money to buy the raw materials<br>we have to look all these different<br>elements<br>before we start i will explain this in<br>the following slides<br>first of all do we have continuous<br>supply of raw materials<br>especially when we see this sort of news<br>in the world<br>um we're lucky we found one<br>uh supplier in the libyan uh who<br>were able to uh give us uh ethanol and<br>other<br>ingredients do you have blood facilities<br>especially we have to we need<br>a species lab because we need to<br>maintain the physical distance during<br>preparation<br>also we needed a fume hood and<br>we are lucky we've had all these my<br>student tushar<br>bought this alcohol meter from the local<br>pharmacy to measure this<br>can we actually prepare hair synthetizer<br>in our laboratory<br>and distribute it to the public or to<br>the university<br>for beyond yes now also the organization<br>says<br>we can but they also say<br>to check with the local guidelines<br>that's the point so we i have to discuss<br>this with<br>the dean of school of pharmacy and then<br>i talked to professor feinfield<br>he introduced me with andrea mcmillan<br>who is the head of university's health<br>and safety compliance<br>and to help university's health and<br>safety committee<br>like including professor lal hampton<br>and dr hamish abduction<br>who helped me to set up<br>this and we had to apply for<br>environmental protection authority<br>for hazardous uh substance compliance we<br>had registered that and we registered<br>dr dustin's group and as a contact<br>person<br>is myself and then we have to take a<br>permission from the<br>new zealand customs for increased<br>alcohol limit<br>so we have to do all these preparations<br>for registration we have to prepare this<br>standard operating procedure<br>and that's a completely a gmp standard i<br>had a student who came from a gmp<br>standard<br>working in a gmt certified company and<br>we<br>in with his help we developed<br>this standard operating procedure<br>and then we have to produce these 14<br>phases<br>a safety data sheet which we<br>kept in the lab and also we have to<br>supply to the users<br>we need to produce this contract and<br>with the help of this university social<br>safety committee<br>we develop this where you can find<br>even you can check in the marketed<br>products if you buy anything<br>you need to have this information about<br>the ingredients<br>which is what ingredients they contain<br>what<br>concentration and also the instruction<br>for use<br>precautions and manufacturing date<br>and base number and finally the<br>manufactured<br>name and also the responsible person<br>need to have also the picture graph<br>showing what<br>like what are the class it is<br>actual production started as you can see<br>the students are doing this<br>inside the film hood uh here we can see<br>and trisha are producing them and here<br>we can see that uh<br>shouldn't request is um<br>he is doing the qc check the final<br>concentration of the sample<br>which need to be um our alcohol contains<br>80<br>and the plus minus five percent we can<br>tolerate that<br>and then feeling which is the most<br>we can see my student is doing also this<br>filling<br>um and it was a different container so<br>you can see here he is feeling currently<br>he's being<br>filling 2.5 liter container but we'll<br>see different types of container later<br>on<br>who is who has printed all the labels<br>and then manually cutting all these<br>levels<br>you can see how tedious it is and<br>uh nicole wrote my another student who<br>is<br>now labeling this now using blue<br>there's a funny story here one day we<br>are working in the<br>all mine and all my students do have<br>finished<br>so we had to i had to drive to home and<br>i borrowed<br>blue from my daughter<br>before the lockdown going all around<br>dunedin<br>we found only 150 bottles<br>and that was all and that was a very<br>small bottle<br>suddenly my colleague president natalie<br>medley could<br>offer me around 200 bottles because she<br>bought she had bought it for her recess<br>and that was in her<br>which was the health at that time<br>and then during lockdown we got this<br>sort of bottle from the polish<br>you can see how convenient they are they<br>can just take it in their pocket and use<br>it<br>from these bottles we got from the<br>university<br>and finally there is no bottles so what<br>we did<br>the alcohol supplied in this bottle and<br>we filled<br>our solution into that and at the latter<br>stage<br>before the lockdown we are able to<br>distribute this sort of handstanding<br>card<br>to our school of pharmacy a staff and<br>students in fact on the<br>day of lockdown we put all these<br>concentration outside<br>our building and student we are standing<br>site<br>and students came and took one by one<br>and finally we gave 100 liters to the<br>university<br>to use during lockdown<br>and between this 23rd march and<br>2nd of june we produce around 1200<br>liters<br>literally we made it according to<br>mercenary we made this<br>industry here and<br>we gave it to all the university<br>services<br>and civil defense police foreign<br>emergencies seldom ambulance<br>maori health provider and many other<br>local<br>essential services<br>what impact it had well it obviously<br>reduced the pressure of hand sanitizer<br>on the market<br>but it certainly has lighted hand<br>hygiene of end users<br>the we believe it helped to reduce the<br>transmission of kavit 19 in this region<br>i don't know whether it has saved any<br>lives however<br>i know that many essential workers<br>especially<br>police and health workers are dying of<br>covet<br>in many countries who don't have access<br>to appropriate protective measures<br>including hand suicide either<br>at economy i received this email you can<br>see<br>this email from one of my<br>one centers from of this university<br>during this comment and she asked for<br>some hamster needed in her<br>email she mentioned that the cost was 17<br>for 100 mm and she could not afford it<br>for her shop<br>my student did a calculation they found<br>that we have produced<br>100 1200 liters whose values are<br>over 200 thousand dollars that we<br>invested only<br>it was extremely difficult<br>to come and do this sort of things<br>during this lockdown time right<br>when you have kids they are watching<br>television<br>and learning the death that infection of<br>kobe<br>right knowing you stay home<br>you maintain the physical distance i saw<br>my two kids scary<br>eyes like when i came out<br>when i went back home i could feel the<br>same for my students<br>i waited every couple of weeks after<br>the production whether i can hear any<br>bad news from them or for myself<br>in fact i maintained a deliberate<br>isolation at home<br>but you know how can i say whom<br>you can see an email here<br>who drives the elderly<br>who are most vulnerable person and they<br>did not have any handshake either<br>you can see this maori provider sent me<br>an email<br>serving 8 000 people they could not have<br>uh hand sanitizer thought it's a highly<br>you can see an email from a person who<br>looks after the health center<br>looking after ten thousand patients we<br>have four<br>staff only one small bottle of hand<br>sanitizer<br>if you receive this sort of email how<br>can you stay home<br>well then i started helping in other<br>ways<br>so many emails and then i thought okay<br>there is a hawksbill<br>uh there we certainly sent email that<br>they want to produce their<br>own hand sanity that can help them yes i<br>can<br>i get them labels i get them safety data<br>sheet and<br>all other of my experience how can they<br>do by themselves<br>the same thing happened in different<br>different servers around indonesian<br>at many individuals many mans from other<br>universities for example i received this<br>email<br>an email from a university of adelaide<br>and actually that person was an<br>alumni of portugal and she found that in<br>the<br>facebook and she contacted me how she<br>can produce the earth<br>in fact on the right hand side you can<br>see hanson teller australia declared<br>that in their website<br>our news and they mentioned that the<br>australian award cities have been<br>inspired by us<br>and three christian universities have<br>it was widely covered by media locally<br>or effort<br>and internationally including europe and<br>the us asia<br>diversity i received many emails from<br>many professors and also<br>uh it was acknowledged by professional<br>health centers<br>and by seller sent me this right-hand<br>side email<br>letter which is good for my students<br>and encouraging to me questions were<br>also acknowledged<br>in the report to the university council<br>and the university has given it to<br>social media including facebook twitter<br>linkedin and instagram<br>the social media there was an<br>overwhelming uh<br>response from the community received<br>around 40 000 likes<br>over 500 appreciating commands<br>over 400 shares and<br>the videos are built over for 15 000<br>times<br>some of the comments you can see here on<br>the left hand side<br>and although over the two and a half<br>months<br>i recall i worked over 15 hours a day as<br>it was the full of my teaching time<br>sometimes<br>more than 12 hours teaching and<br>all the teaching like from face to face<br>overnight it was a an online so a lot of<br>but on top of that i had to come to the<br>lab<br>to prepare the hans integer but on top<br>of that<br>i had to respond on average 30 to 50<br>emails each day<br>related to hamster intelligence either<br>asking to get some free<br>or wanted to buy from us or wanted to<br>volunteer in the project<br>or wanting to donate to us for example<br>one company offered 500 liters of<br>internal to us<br>wanted to get advice or how to prepare<br>the hand sanitizer or someone is coming<br>for a business problem however<br>my team and i have been gratified<br>by the love and affection we have found<br>from the citizens of new zealand and<br>overseas<br>you can see this uh just an example<br>from an ordinary new zealander in<br>lockdown impressed and<br>grateful for our initiative antare male<br>finally i would like to acknowledge my<br>team<br>who did all the hard work<br>i actually i also like to thank my<br>marketing team<br>reward pin craig barley and cleon duff<br>and kently<br>um south hub vs team who helped a lot<br>to supply all these materials um very<br>quickly<br>lab supply and the property services<br>finally i would like to thank dean<br>school of pharmacy professor columera<br>for her his continuous encouragement and<br>initial funding<br>and all the during copy time andrew<br>ferguson who was my<br>primary contact who helped me all doing<br>this<br>all distribution and looking after<br>everything professor philippe<br>and again the university of health and<br>safety team<br>president hampton dr hamisha richard and<br>india macmillan i also like to thank<br>probation seller and vulnerable basis<br>who actually encouraged me to<br>do this and the fun again the funding<br>from<br>for his school of pharmacy and<br>university of otago<br>and i'm back on camera we have a few<br>questions that have come through for you<br>firstly do you have plans to continue<br>production of your hand sanitizer<br>thank you yes uh in my last events<br>i prepared on second june which is the<br>level two<br>however i have offered the university<br>and the university is<br>like a property services are now<br>in an agreement that<br>we will continue to produce for the<br>university<br>in emergency and fundamental<br>this will be an ongoing process if<br>university needs i will do it thank you<br>thank you one more question are there<br>thank you this sort of uh questions i<br>have<br>received a lot whether i can sell them<br>or that i can<br>uh export or whether i can<br>start a business no at this moment i'm<br>not gonna<br>i have no plan for business and no plan<br>for<br>exporting however i am now overseas like<br>for<br>example bangladesh there are many people<br>are<br>in bangladesh now the kobe rate is high<br>so many people are contracting for<br>a consultation around this and i'm<br>helping them i'm<br>frequently going to the media in<br>bangladesh to<br>provide my expertise and to<br>inactivate proteins by denaturation<br>process we call<br>and the viruses<br>well in our formulation particularly we<br>use glycerol<br>to keep it moist and uh<br>so in fact this formulation the walter<br>organization has done all the studies<br>and<br>our tolerance and accessibility have<br>found that<br>this formula is<br>is more acceptable and better<br>uh to keep our hand moist<br>next question and i hope that everyone<br>can hear me okay um is there any reason<br>why the world health organization<br>uses the general version of hand<br>sanitizer all the spray versions equally<br>effective<br>well i what i'm aware the uh what<br>we produce this um this liquid<br>one in this one<br>we use uh only alcohol hydrogen peroxide<br>and glycerol into the liquid version<br>to make gel version you add deliberately<br>some gelling agent<br>which may inactivate there is a chance<br>that they can reduce the activity<br>of handsome tiger however there is<br>always there like a telling like what<br>people want<br>what people like um that's another thing<br>and what is available because when the<br>ws would take a decision<br>then they should take thinking all over<br>the world<br>including uh their thing like africa<br>and western world i think all around<br>my students my students i'm<br>grateful to my students they are so<br>excited and they are<br>so good human being that they think that<br>yeah they feel<br>um helping the community<br>actually um actually the<br>really really rewarding experience<br>good that they could help this community<br>during this date<br>through this project uh<br>can the formula be shared directly with<br>the community<br>again can the hand sanitizer formula be<br>shared with the community<br>possibly they can make it themselves yes<br>it is it is available in their<br>world health organization if you need<br>this formula you can email me<br>it is also available in the world health<br>organization website<br>uh if you don't find you can email me or<br>it is also probably in this<br>presentation is i mentioned here here<br>and one question from a keen home<br>distiller<br>is raw alcohol sufficient or do you also<br>need the other ingredients that you<br>added<br>um you need like um what i understand<br>that<br>alcohol um what we used to use 96<br>percent<br>uh alcohol that was prescribed in<br>wall health organization formula now<br>we need to we need other ingredients<br>in the solution like we use hydrogen<br>peroxide to inactivate<br>any spore forming bacteria which they<br>come from other sources right<br>we also need to you cannot use alcohol<br>all the time<br>your hand will be dry so that's why we<br>are using glycerol<br>so that keeps your hands moist um<br>so yeah that's why you are you are not<br>using only alcohol and<br>washing your hands you need some other<br>ingredients to make it a<br>nice formula and formulation that's why<br>the pharmacist or<br>a formulation scientist our expert is<br>there right thank you<br>thank you very much we don't have time<br>for any more questions so if there are a<br>few more that have come through<br>uh we will email them to you dr gus and<br>you can answer in writing and we'll put<br>those on the<br>everyone</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
