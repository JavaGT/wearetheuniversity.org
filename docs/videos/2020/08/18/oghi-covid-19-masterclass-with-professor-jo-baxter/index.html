is<br>the associate dean maori<br>at the koitu center for hauura maori at<br>the university of<br>togo her talk will focus on<br>understanding key issues for maori in<br>thank you phil for inviting me to<br>contribute to this series of talks<br>and to have the opportunity to provide a<br>background<br>focus on maori and covert<br>my name is joe baxter and i'm professor<br>of maori health at in the otago medical<br>school<br>and i'm also a public health medicine<br>physician<br>my academic and professional journey<br>have focused on issues of equity and<br>maori outcomes<br>including mental health and suicide<br>maori child health inequities<br>maori tertiary education and equity and<br>maori health workforce<br>with regards to clovert i currently sit<br>on a recently established ministry of<br>health covert 19 maori monitoring group<br>and have been part of a reference group<br>to the ministry of health<br>so the position i take in speaking to<br>you today<br>is one that foregrounds the covert<br>response to maori within a tattoo<br>frameworks<br>the time for this talk is brief and as<br>such this talk<br>takes a wide sweep over the context and<br>response<br>within aotearoa meteoroid ponemo to<br>clover 19 and maori<br>in that sweep the focus is on issues of<br>equity<br>and we'll dip into some critical<br>contexts<br>outline some key aspects of government<br>and health sector response<br>and take a look at maori responses<br>actions and aspirations<br>finally exploring where to from here<br>a range of sources of information have<br>fed into this talk<br>and given the brevity of it it's not<br>possible to go into depth<br>in relation to those sources however all<br>are referenced on the slide so you can<br>it is fitting to position the maori<br>experience in response to the covert 19<br>pandemic<br>with cognizance and respect for a number<br>of critical contexts<br>including historical political<br>societal and health contexts history<br>speaks of a tragic picture of the<br>disproportionate<br>impact that previous pandemics have had<br>on maori<br>as evidenced by the 1913 smallpox<br>pandemic followed by the 1918 influenza<br>pandemics which caused devastation for<br>maori whanau and communities<br>data suggests that about four to five<br>percent of the maori population<br>died in the 1918 influenza pandemic<br>with rates that were between seven to<br>eight times higher than non-maori new<br>zealanders<br>marked inequities in mortality were also<br>experienced in the 1957 pandemic<br>and more recently during the h1n1<br>influenza pandemic of 2009<br>where rates of influenza were twice as<br>high for maori compared with pakhya<br>and maori were also three times more<br>likely to be hospitalized<br>and almost three times more likely to<br>die than pakia<br>the legacy of early pandemics and<br>inequities and other infectious diseases<br>and other health conditions has resulted<br>in a maori population<br>that is primed to be very very very<br>wary of this pandemic aware not only of<br>the impacts of such an event<br>however the need to take urgent and<br>extreme action<br>in order to protect maori communities<br>and the most precious and vulnerable<br>within those communities<br>dr reese jones in an article on march<br>18th<br>explored further why maori appear to be<br>at greater risk for pandemics<br>he talked about different factors at<br>play including underlying<br>social and economic disadvantage as a<br>result of historical and contemporary<br>colonisation<br>he talked about a greater burden of<br>chronic diseases that<br>increase the risk of more serious<br>outcomes from infections such as<br>influenza<br>and also more poor access to quality<br>of health care dr jones joined many<br>others<br>and you can see multiple<br>interviews reports and articles<br>making calls in relation to our covered<br>response to ensure an<br>equity lens is applied to new zealand's<br>response<br>maori health experts expressed genuine<br>concern<br>that taking a one-size-fits-all approach<br>may not be as effective for maori<br>evidence for increased risk has been<br>held out by researchers<br>from punahou matatani the university of<br>canterbury<br>university of auckland and manaki fenua<br>have used modelling to predict risk of<br>infection<br>taking into account such risk factors<br>including health care and co-morbidity<br>during the course of the pandemic they<br>are modeled estimates across various age<br>groups so maori and pacifica populations<br>would have a higher infection fatality<br>rate in comparison to european<br>populations and other groups in new<br>zealand<br>modeling shows that because of<br>underlying health conditions<br>disadvantage and structural racism the<br>death rate for covert 19<br>could be as much as 2.5 times higher for<br>maori<br>concern over increased risk is further<br>reinforced by international evidence<br>where marked<br>inequities are already being reported<br>for population groups<br>who experience marginalization and<br>oppression<br>with usa and uk both showing<br>socioeconomically disadvantaged groups<br>people of color<br>and those who work in the front line all<br>at increased risk<br>with considerable intersectionality<br>among these risk factors contributing to<br>inequities<br>it is noted that the navajo nation in<br>the usa has the highest per capita<br>so how have we responded as a nation<br>and what does our policy look like so<br>new zealand's covert 19 health and<br>disability system response plan is<br>certainly worth<br>anyone who's interested in what we're<br>doing in relation to covert<br>worth looking at and within that plan<br>there is a very clear set of statements<br>one of them relates to a commitment to<br>tariq or waitangi<br>and it does highlight maori as a<br>priority population group<br>and recognizes increased susceptibility<br>there is recognition that previous<br>pandemic responses<br>have in fact failed to ensure equity and<br>the plan explicitly states<br>equity and active protection as part of<br>the plan goes on to draw on the<br>principles<br>that were outlined in the y2575<br>territory or waitangi claim for maori<br>protection in addition incorporates the<br>provision of<br>options for services and the importance<br>of partnership<br>these principles are reinforced across a<br>number of other documents<br>and they seem to have become a really<br>clear platform<br>both for ensuring that we prioritize<br>equity<br>but that also for maori we take into<br>account<br>the very key requirement<br>to support maori to have tinoranga<br>in april the ministry of health released<br>a maori response<br>action plan as a living document that<br>aimed to focus on strategies for maori<br>in recognition that the pandemic phases<br>changed<br>then the plan would need to adapt it<br>foregrounded<br>the principles talked about previously<br>in the overall plan<br>as well as four expressions of the<br>treaty<br>these four goals encompass stewardship<br>maori self-determination equity of<br>outcomes<br>and respecting and enabling teow maori<br>and i'm not going to go through this<br>diagram but if you look at the report<br>you will see<br>how these principles are converted into<br>actions than the report<br>in order to support the response to<br>maori alongside the funding that<br>came to all services<br>the whole of government response to<br>funding a specific amount of 56.5<br>million dollars<br>was provided to focus on maori support<br>in response to the covered<br>breakdown and this includes 30 million<br>dollars specifically for health<br>as well as other funding to support<br>whanau order and community outreach<br>the kind of health funding that was<br>provided<br>was spread across specific areas<br>including resources for whanau<br>bolstering maori health providers and<br>whanau order services<br>and a range of others including<br>community-based<br>assessment centres in maori communities<br>development of communications and health<br>literacy resources<br>tele health support and very importantly<br>increasing access for maori to influenza<br>vaccinations<br>what we know and what we have gathered<br>through the reports from people who have<br>been part of the<br>great mobilization to deliver services<br>has been that the funding has been<br>critical<br>to the widespread mobilization and<br>grassroots<br>service development and responses across<br>many maori communities<br>organizations and whanau and it is an<br>example<br>that many people are now looking at for<br>how we can utilize approaches<br>to directly supporting<br>multi-mobilization to<br>deliver health services<br>so the maori response um when we look<br>at that has been characterized by taking<br>an equity lens<br>with a high degree of commitment and<br>adaptation<br>it's been very value-centered there's<br>been lots of examples of innovation and<br>resourcefulness<br>solutions focused and strengths focused<br>with many examples of collaborations and<br>partnerships groups coming together<br>with a real commitment to making a<br>difference for maori<br>and i've identified here a whole range<br>of areas<br>where this has happened building<br>collaborations<br>protecting maori communities providing<br>advice<br>advocacy and influence adjusting<br>and working with and adapting tikanga<br>and cultural practices and<br>responsiveness to<br>maori working with data and information<br>monitoring<br>mobilizing maori services including<br>whanau aura in iwihapu and whanau<br>development of resources and health<br>information<br>health literacy and influencing wider<br>economic business<br>and employment policy and strategy so a<br>huge mobilization<br>of maori throughout malta when we look<br>at<br>some very specifics about testing and<br>this is<br>between 22nd of january to 27th<br>of may we see that maori were tested at<br>a slightly higher rate than non-maori on<br>average<br>on the 24th of april the ministry of<br>health told dhbs to ensure their testing<br>was covering off maori<br>and in some places ewe health providers<br>quickly started bolstering the efforts<br>to test maori<br>and taranaki mobile clinics were ramped<br>up<br>in isolated places and between<br>18th and 30th of april the maori testing<br>rate per thousand<br>people jumped the academic roboti tonui<br>had been tracking numbers closely<br>reported a marked increase which he<br>believed that getting maori health<br>providers involved<br>over 19 test positivity rates by dhb and<br>ethnicity were part of the data that was<br>being collected and i won't go through<br>this<br>slide but what it shows is overall 0.2<br>of maori and pacific people who were<br>tested<br>were found to be positive and 0.5<br>of asian and others and i've just gotten<br>yellow the southern dhb where we see<br>something a little bit different which<br>is 1.2<br>of maori we are tested who were tested<br>were positive<br>so lots of capacity to look at data and<br>to try and identify where<br>areas of equity could be addressed<br>and that has been a really important<br>part so overall when we look at our<br>total cases<br>we see that compared to other pandemics<br>sofa maori have feared well in terms of<br>cases<br>with only 9 of total cases<br>currently reported being maori<br>so this concept of protection that has<br>been highlighted and learnings from 100<br>years ago provided maori with important<br>information<br>about ways in which we can protect<br>communities with historical accounts<br>and early pandemics of maori communities<br>closing their borders<br>reducing access and even entire<br>communities packing up and moving<br>in order to provide protection encompass<br>strategies to support wellbeing and<br>livelihoods of those<br>impacted by pandemics devastation<br>and the role of leadership and<br>protecting maori communities has been<br>critical<br>so even though we were able to look to<br>the leadership of people going back a<br>hundred years<br>uh many of the same sentiments and the<br>desires<br>to provide protection uh were also<br>um of real relevance today<br>and you will all be aware through the<br>media<br>and some very interesting media are<br>reporting<br>about the decision from a number of<br>maori communities to close down<br>their access to their communities and to<br>provide<br>roadblocks and check-in points<br>and it's not surprising that early on<br>maori communities chose to introduce<br>these roadblocks and checkpoints the<br>legacy of such a great loss<br>100 years earlier was at the forefront<br>of people's minds<br>maori led roadblocks and checkpoints<br>became a core feature<br>of the maori response in a number of<br>regions<br>these roadblocks sought to achieve what<br>we as a country have been seeking to<br>achieve with our border closures<br>and it's the main purpose to protect our<br>populations<br>in addition to roadblocks uh these<br>roadblocks have involved many positives<br>including<br>providing a point where people who are<br>passing are offered advice and<br>well-being services<br>they're checked in on and able to make<br>links with health care and other<br>services<br>these aspects were much less well<br>reported in the media<br>a further focus of protection alongside<br>whole communities<br>has been the desire by maori to protect<br>most vulnerable people<br>including mobilization to protect<br>elderly<br>those people with chronic health issues<br>calls for an equity lens were made by<br>many health leaders and health experts<br>across the country<br>and over the past three months these<br>numerous articles and interviews all<br>highlight the need for<br>our responses to engage heavily with<br>maori<br>is a group of maori health leaders and<br>experts who are very concerned about the<br>lack of presence of maori<br>in the response to the coven 19 pandemic<br>in its early days and became heavily<br>engaged<br>in providing information<br>shaping response to equity providing a<br>public voice<br>and expertise and most<br>importantly creating a platform<br>for conversations and for<br>information resources advocacy<br>maori approach to messaging has been<br>strengths based<br>and mana enhancing whereas<br>in the past and for many health issues<br>it is very difficult<br>to have a platform of information that's<br>focused<br>specifically on maori um this<br>the resourcing and the support for maori<br>development of resources has meant that<br>there is now<br>a wide range of resources tailored<br>to diverse aspects of the community<br>the pu tahitangan maori<br>whanau order maori commissioning agency<br>for the south island<br>coined the term manatee 20 converting<br>covert 19<br>to something that they saw as much more<br>organisations such as the final order<br>commissioning agencies<br>have undertaken a whole range of<br>individual as well as group and whanau<br>supports<br>and there's a lot of data and<br>information about the kinds of<br>activities<br>so when we look at this response we see<br>growth of maori health providers<br>community-based assessment centres<br>very importantly also increase in maori<br>taking up<br>influenza vaccinations including<br>social media campaigns public health and<br>social sector supports<br>and i think there is a lot of belief<br>among people delivering these services<br>that they're feeling like despite this<br>being a time of high stress and high<br>needs among maori communities<br>the mobilization of supports and<br>services<br>has greatly impacted upon<br>very positively those maori communities<br>cultural responsiveness has been seen in<br>all sorts of places including the<br>development of new terms and language to<br>fit<br>with the epidemic and the pandemic<br>and the response to cultural practices<br>including the use of mirai and<br>tangihanga have been ongoing<br>and difficult part of the lock down mali<br>have taken on board the various<br>requirements over tangihanga at each<br>phase of the lockdown<br>however this has been difficult for many<br>and some commentary tangihanga the<br>ability to farewell a loved one<br>as a core part of maori society and<br>well-being<br>level four restrictions were rigid and<br>devalued the importance of multicultural<br>practices<br>according to some commentators so others<br>have spoken about the need to sacrifice<br>these rights<br>and a number of solutions were raised<br>including holding off tangy until after<br>lockdown<br>just thinking more broadly the role of<br>services<br>ewe and others have provided a range of<br>community<br>um based responsiveness across many<br>regions and communities<br>meeting the needs of many maori and<br>whanau in an april paper<br>cuckoo title state that over the past<br>month<br>ewi and maori communities have<br>demonstrated a remarkable capacity to<br>anticipate and respond to the needs of<br>their people<br>setting up checkpoints to protect<br>vulnerable and remote communities to<br>providing online support for grieving<br>whanau<br>and delivering care packages to elders<br>indigenous communities in aotearoa and<br>elsewhere demonstrate powerful<br>distributed leadership<br>and a deep capacity to care for each<br>other based on the strength and<br>knowledge of can<br>so other people have also focused on<br>the fact that we have learnt much and<br>dion tutor highlights<br>maori will emerge from the stronger and<br>more connected because of our focus on<br>protecting<br>people he goes on to talk about the<br>strength of maori resilience<br>through unity and relationships<br>however we need to hold that thought as<br>some predict the impacts will hit maori<br>hard in every recession<br>maori have been impacted more than other<br>ethnic groups<br>maori currently already have a baseline<br>unemployment rate of 8.2<br>the maori council highlighted that as we<br>head into recovery phase<br>so it is indeed timely to reflect on<br>what we have learned about the maori<br>response how well tenuranga teretanga is<br>reflected<br>and importantly how well are we tracking<br>to ensure equity<br>is a priority for outcomes in relation<br>to the covered response<br>is indeed realised how do we take into<br>account the upcoming challenges in<br>relation to socio-economic<br>and wider determinants commentators are<br>in agreement that in order to not<br>accentuate<br>and equities at this point some very<br>important<br>pro-equity strategies are required in<br>the whole of government approach<br>and in the approaches taken in each<br>sector including health<br>education and employment<br>it seems very clear that unless we move<br>together<br>to actively reject increasing inequity<br>as an acceptable outcome of the covert<br>19 pandemic<br>our gaze in our national response thus<br>needs to go to how we can build a future<br>that honors tita or waitangi and acts to<br>address historical<br>current and future inequity<br>this is indeed timely as we live in a<br>time where we have the outcomes of the<br>y2575 claim reinforcing key principles<br>and tenuranga teretanga<br>we have the health and disability sector<br>review<br>which includes at around page 174<br>an approach to build on the positive<br>outcomes achieved as part of maori-led<br>mobilization of partnerships<br>services and culturally responsive<br>approaches<br>thank you joanne we have two questions<br>that have come through so far<br>and i will read them as they've come<br>through infection rates of maori and<br>pacific islanders were approximately six<br>percent<br>whereas that of europeans and asians<br>nine to 10<br>do you have a view about these<br>differences<br>i think if we look at<br>the cases that we had and phil may also<br>an indication of this many of the cases<br>we had had direct links<br>to overseas travel or contacts with<br>overseas travel<br>and so i think there was probably very<br>much an ethnicity<br>association with that and then the other<br>key areas were areas such as<br>the clusters that occurred in rest homes<br>and again<br>there are some differences in terms of<br>the ethnic makeup of people who end up<br>in west home care so i think it's a<br>cluster<br>related issue but also very and it's<br>also a positive<br>picture in terms of the fact that we<br>didn't have the level of community<br>spread that would have potentially meant<br>that those people who are most<br>vulnerable<br>are likely to end up um<br>being most impacted<br>okay thank you another question here<br>do you think maori language and concepts<br>for example rahui could be more<br>prominent in the whole of new zealand<br>the government's approach instead of<br>something that is specific to maori<br>communities<br>i think actually the word vahui has come<br>up<br>as like many other maori terms and words<br>once they enter an understanding<br>such as concepts such as whanau<br>vanogatanga<br>the concept of rahui is one that<br>ultimately is one of protection and<br>positivity so<br>i would envisage that it would become<br>something<br>and what is your view on the way the<br>government has thus far engaged with<br>maori in the national covenanting<br>response<br>um i think i suppose i've got a mixed<br>view<br>in that i i think it took a bit of time<br>for people to fully engage<br>but overall<br>i think we're actually sitting at a<br>point a knife edge i think would be the<br>way that i<br>i see it and that we've got to a certain<br>point<br>where there's been funding resources<br>policy development which has allowed us<br>to<br>start to get some positive outcomes<br>including<br>outcomes from the maori response<br>and i think<br>where we go from here will help us fully<br>understand how well the government has<br>responded<br>and i think that really sits in terms of<br>how the government responds to things<br>like the health and disability sector<br>review<br>and the calls for maori to take um<br>leadership and to gain more<br>more ownership of aspects of health<br>service<br>delivery and commissioning such like<br>thank you joanne i'm going to wait a few<br>seconds in case anybody else has any<br>questions they'd like to type into the q<br>a we don't have an enormous amount of<br>time obviously in our in our webinars<br>due to the tight schedule but if you do<br>have any questions please do type them<br>in<br>nothing seems to be coming through so<br>i'm<br>like to thank you very much joanne if<br>anything does come through we'll email<br>more to you and you can answer in<br>writing<br>thank you very much and on to our next<br>presenter</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
