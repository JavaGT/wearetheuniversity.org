What will the new normal be? What is the Tiaki Promise in this new world? What are the new values? And what should tourism in New Zealand look like?<br><br>These questions lead us to ponder the re-emergence and re-imagination of New Zealand tourism post COVID-19 as well as what a responsible pathway might look like. In this recorded webinar, three thought leaders provide insights of what a responsible future could look like—whether it is rethinking our indigenous connections, our relationships with nature, or the value of tourism to communities, businesses, and New Zealand.<br><br><br>Speakers and topics<br><br>Dr. Pauline J. Sheldon<br><br>Dr. Sheldon is Professor Emerita at University of Hawaii, USA. Her areas of interest are regenerative tourism, transformative tourist experiences, social entrepreneurship, and wellness tourism. She has published many books and research articles, is a frequent keynote speaker at international conferences, and has worked with international agencies such as UNWTO, APEC and the World Bank.<br><br>Topic: Transformation of tourism: Time for a fundamental re-think<br><br>This presentation will examine the premises underlying most tourism to date, and will suggest new values and economic structures that may be helpful as destinations re-think their future.  The principles of regenerative tourism and their application in a new post-Covid world will be discussed.<br><br><br>Dr Ken Hughey<br><br>Ken Hughey is Chief Science Advisor at Te Papa Atawhai Department of Conservation (DOC). He works there on secondment from Lincoln University where he is Professor of Environmental Management. His research areas are eclectic and range from endangered species economics, environmental perceptions, and wetland and braided river management to aspects of sustainable tourism. At DOC he is on the Senior Leadership Team and works across the organisation. In the visitor space he is heavily involved in hazards and risk but also sustainable tourism and research investment<br><br>Topic: Will thinking about ‘responsible tourism’ soon revert to a practice of ‘irresponsible tourism’?<br><br>COVID-19 has given us a once in a decade opportunity to reset our economy, including in the tourism space. How do we construct this opportunity in engaging and meaningful ways that lead to ‘responsible’ changes (and does the announcement that Christchurch Airport plans a new airport near Queenstown fly in the face of this thinking)?<br><br>I propose four ideas to think about:<br><br>- Building further the Tiaki Promise.<br>- Sitting the Promise within a planetary boundaries approach.<br>- A commitment to building the new industry into the well-being framework<br>- A just transitions approach which enables existing tourism enterprises with potential to reach each of the above.<br><br>And I end with a warning—that pushing for business as usual is not responsible; it’s irresponsible.<br><br><br>Dr Anna Carr<br><br>Anna has been an academic at the Department of Tourism, University of Otago, New Zealand since 2001. She is co-director of the Centre for Recreation Research. Her current research interests focus on the environmental management of tourism and recreation,  cultural landscapes and indigenous community development. She serves on the editorial boards of Tourism in Marine Environments, Journal of Ecotourism and the Journal of Heritage Tourism. Before academia, Anna was owner-operator of two adventure tourism businesses and had several decades’ experience working in various tourism businesses and NZ national parks.<br><br>Topic: Indigenous tourism, wairua and the nature-human connection<br><br>There is a growing global consciousness that marginalised or peripheral communities are places where nature-based experiences can benefit peoples’ wellbeing. Many nature tourism operators in New Zealand are hoping the resumption of domestic travel can sustain their businesses. Māori owned and operated experiences located in peripheral, rural destinations away from traditional tourism hotspots are particularly conscious of their interdependence with natural resources and the need to ensure nature is cared for. Such businesses realise their role is more than being a tourism operation at these times when nature is significant both for its intrinsic values but also for human well-being. Many are contributing to enhancing natural biodiversity and human flourishing in a sustainable manner that is not just focussed on delivering ‘tourism’. This presentation considers Māori tourism operators’ experiences in southern Te Wahi Pounamu (the South Island) where coping with the pandemic is strengthened by traditional values. These businesses are not just tourism-focussed but valued for being community and nature-centric delivering an array of cultural, biodiversity, educational and health outcomes.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>objectives where we look at the<br>perspective from indigenous<br>um through indigenous eyes we look at it<br>natural environmental perspective and we<br>look at it more also from the personal<br>perspective so many different dimensions<br>will be covered in this i would like to<br>introduce<br>our three speakers all of them<br>experts in their field with a huge depth<br>of experience and it's a real pleasure<br>to be able to have all of them join us<br>from different parts of the country and<br>in fact different parts of the pacific<br>so professor pauline sheldon is joining<br>us<br>from the university of hawaii where she<br>is an emeritus professor<br>and really coming from another part of<br>of the pacific so i just need to find<br>the right bio um her areas of interest<br>are regenerative tourism<br>transformative tourist experiences<br>social entrepreneurship<br>and wellness tourism she has published<br>many books and research articles<br>is a frequent keynote speaker at<br>international conferences and has worked<br>with international agencies such as<br>unwto<br>apec and the world bank and is<br>the co-founder of the mighty<br>tourism education futures initiative<br>which<br>many of you who are in academia will<br>likely be familiar with<br>um then turning to dr<br>anna carr associate professor at the<br>university of otago she is the<br>co-director for the center<br>of recreation research and anna has been<br>an academic at the department of tourism<br>at the university<br>since 2001 she is co-director of the<br>the center and her current research<br>interests focus on environmental<br>management of tourism and recreation<br>cultural landscapes and indigenous<br>community development<br>she serves on numerous<br>uh editorial boards and maybe anna will<br>also<br>um share herself what her whakapapa is<br>in terms of<br>where she she sits and stands in<br>maoridom<br>and our third speaker is professor<br>ken hui and i have to find this one<br>again<br>he is chief science advisor for<br>the department of conservation to papa<br>attafi and he works on secondment from<br>lincoln university where he is a<br>professor of environmental management so<br>for all things environmental management<br>ken is your<br>your guide to go to his research areas<br>are eclectic and range from endangered<br>species economics<br>environmental perceptions and wetlands<br>and braided river management to aspects<br>of sustainable tourism<br>and dock he is on the senior leadership<br>team and works across the organization<br>so it's a pleasure to have these three<br>great speakers who<br>as i say bring such diverse perspectives<br>onto this you can see the titles and<br>without wanting to take up too much more<br>of the time<br>i would like to introduce the first<br>speaker<br>who will talk to the transformation of<br>tourism<br>time for a fundamental rethink and this<br>is<br>thank you very much christian and thank<br>you to ian for the invitation to join<br>this webinar thank you to all of you for<br>joining us i'm coming to you across the<br>pacific ocean from hawaii i wish i could<br>see you all<br>but i know you're there so<br>i think we would all agree we're at a<br>very dramatic inflection point<br>in the trajectory of tourism we look<br>over our shoulder at the days of<br>overtourism<br>and we look forward to the massive<br>uncertainty<br>of the pandemic of climate change and<br>many other disruptions that seem to be<br>ahead so i'd like to begin my<br>presentation<br>uh with a quote this is arundhati<br>roy historically pandemics are forced<br>humans to break with the past<br>and see the world in you this is no<br>different<br>it's a portal between one world and the<br>next we can walk through it dragging the<br>carcasses of our avarice<br>our dead ideas our dead rivers and smoky<br>skies behind us or<br>we can travel lightly with little<br>luggage ready<br>to imagine another world and i think<br>that's why we're here today to<br>do that so dividing my presentation into<br>three sections first of all<br>is to examine what is the luggage we<br>have to leave behind to go through this<br>portal<br>so i'll address that the second thing i<br>want to talk about are some frameworks<br>for taking us forward into a transformed<br>tourism as we rethink<br>and lastly the third part of my<br>presentation i'm going to<br>talk about how we can design tourism<br>experiences<br>for the new kind of tourism that we face<br>so let's begin with the luggage we have<br>okay so one of the things i think that<br>uh has been responsible for uh much of<br>the problems in our world is the<br>neoliberal economic system<br>that uh is for many intents and purposes<br>fit for the dustbin of history this is<br>one thing i think<br>one piece of luggage that we have to<br>leave behind<br>um why because it has some basic<br>assumptions<br>that don't seem to be true anymore first<br>of all<br>that self-interest drives ideal human<br>behavior by being selfish is the best<br>thing to do<br>second it encourages consumption for its<br>own sake<br>and tourism itself is a very over<br>consumptive industry and we have to look<br>at that<br>the third one only competition can lead<br>to progress<br>no consideration of collaborative<br>efforts<br>and the idea that more income equals<br>more happiness well there's some truth<br>to that of course we need a certain<br>level of income but we know that<br>happiness is much<br>more complex than that but finally and<br>what i want to base my presentation on<br>is that it ignores human values right<br>this old system of profit maximization<br>and production ignores human values what<br>values the values<br>that all people across all traditions<br>and cultures hold dear<br>whether it be caring responsibility<br>integrity<br>compassion courage all of these human<br>values that are often grounded<br>in the ancient wisdom of indigenous<br>cultures<br>these are the values that i think we<br>need to look to<br>to drive and envision and rethink<br>a new uh a new type of tourism next<br>slide please<br>so a lot of thought has gone into how we<br>can restructure<br>uh socioeconomic um destinations<br>and i'd like to just touch briefly on<br>six of them and give you an<br>example of what's happening in hawaii<br>that might be informative<br>so the first is the collaborative<br>economy we know well this is where<br>social capital is valued and um<br>the the sharing of resources becomes a<br>very important part of<br>economic activity very relevant to<br>tourism<br>the second one is the economic economy<br>of creativity where the focus and the<br>light is shown<br>on human ingenuity human knowledge human<br>intelligence our ability to adapt and<br>innovate<br>and when we focus on this it becomes<br>very different and really supports<br>entrepreneurship and social<br>entrepreneurship that's so important as<br>tourism look forward<br>goes then we have the circular economy<br>of course which focuses on resource<br>deficiency<br>uh making sure that waste is recycled<br>through and that's a very important part<br>of us<br>rethinking where we go forward<br>the fourth one is the sacred economy<br>this was started by<br>charles eisenstein the idea that we can<br>we can really<br>focus on the interconnectivity of<br>all of us focus on the reverence<br>that brings us together and again it's<br>the indigenous cultures that<br>in new zealand hawaii and and everywhere<br>in the world<br>that carries this spiritual wealth a<br>spiritual wealth that can be a platform<br>for us to move forward<br>the fifth one is the economy of<br>generosity which flies in the face<br>directly<br>of the selfish motive of the neoliberal<br>economy right<br>the idea that what can i give to the<br>world rather than what can i take and<br>there's some incredible research that's<br>been done showing<br>how powerful generosity is and tourism<br>is starting to redesign itself in some<br>places<br>so that the flow of generosity between<br>tourists and residents<br>the the kindness the reciprocity<br>can be an important part of moving<br>forward<br>and the sixth one on this slide is the<br>regenerative economy<br>this is perhaps the most fundamentally<br>different and most comprehensive<br>approach to shift the way we think about<br>our economy<br>and it incorporates the other five and<br>it's really<br>uh very profoundly different and<br>requires a very different mindset<br>looking at how tourism can be a tool<br>to build back to regenerate to bring<br>life back into the systems in a<br>destination and there's such potential<br>to do that if we move forward and what<br>it will require of course<br>is those values that we know are so<br>so so important when those are enlivened<br>in all tourism stakeholders<br>then i think that is a way forward what<br>i'd like to do now is share a very<br>very briefly an initiative in hawaii<br>working with these<br>ideas particularly the regenerative<br>economy next slide please<br>christian so<br>as you may know hawaii depends on<br>tourism<br>quite extensively about 30 percent of<br>our economy<br>is tourism and so we are uh suffering<br>greatly<br>from its uh its demise over these last<br>months and uh two three months ago<br>uh an incredible group of about 13<br>hawaiian leaders came together across<br>all<br>sections of society and started to<br>envision<br>an alternative economic future for<br>hawaii<br>they called it the aina aloha economic<br>future and if you would like to<br>research it some more you just google<br>that and it will take you right to the<br>website there<br>doing two things first of all it's a<br>community-based initiative<br>so they're working to get input from all<br>sectors of the community<br>moving forward but more importantly<br>it's grounded in native hawaiian values<br>and the native hawaiian culture has many<br>many beautiful values that<br>that are the pillars of of the culture<br>they've chosen four that um are used<br>here to create a springboard<br>for um the aina aloha<br>economic futures initiative and i just<br>wanted to briefly describe them there in<br>the hawaiian language but i'm going to<br>give you a translation of each of them<br>the first one keeper this means<br>the desire to share selflessly the best<br>of what we have<br>that concept of hospitality when you<br>have a guest in your home you give them<br>the best that you have that's all keeper<br>aina is the<br>long-term stewardship of the natural<br>resources<br>is the ruling uh or the the leaders of<br>society<br>and opua ali is that uh requirement<br>that the leaders are responsible and<br>accountable back to the community<br>and the last one imei kelekela<br>is a beautiful value of challenging the<br>status quo<br>of looking at innovation looking at<br>creativity<br>and new ways of doing things so out of<br>the many values these are the four they<br>chose<br>and regenerative tourism is one<br>of the goals of working with these<br>different sectors of society it's a very<br>cross-sectoral<br>initiative and a very community-based<br>one it's relatively new it's gaining a<br>lot of traction<br>uh we still in the weeks and months<br>ahead we'll have to wait to see<br>uh the degree to which uh policy is put<br>in place but it's it's a movement<br>without uh being stopped i think<br>so the values then that the community<br>holds dear and the values that<br>will drive us and allow us to rethink<br>where we go in the future<br>need to be embraced by all stakeholders<br>by the policy makers by the government<br>by the businesses by the<br>residents in the community and by the<br>tourists themselves and i think this is<br>sometimes we<br>we forget that right as we redesign and<br>rethink tourism<br>who do we want to have come and visit<br>our shores who do we want to welcome<br>who are the quality tourists not the<br>ones that spend the most or<br>the largest in terms of numbers but who<br>are the quality ones and i think they're<br>the ones that have the high values<br>that we've been referring to so the last<br>slide i have<br>is to share with you some research i've<br>just published in hours of tourism<br>research this month next slide please<br>christian<br>where i've been looking at how we can<br>design tourism experiences<br>for this transformation because we can<br>see that<br>tourists want more meaning and i think<br>post covered<br>they will increasingly want to have<br>experiences that are deeper in terms of<br>the meaning they bring to their lives<br>and they're looking<br>to transform their consciousness and<br>live the higher values that we're<br>talking about<br>so the small bubble at the top uh<br>recognizes that tourism does<br>have an incredible power to provide<br>transformational moments and experiences<br>yeah<br>we all know that when we're out of our<br>normal routine<br>our mindfulness is greater we have a<br>sense of flow<br>uh we we often experience or<br>and wonder that brings us back into the<br>moment it allows us to<br>reconnect with that sort of innocent<br>appreciation of life that we had when we<br>were children<br>and often it provides peak experiences<br>that can actually<br>expand us and in terms of who we are and<br>how we view the world<br>so this paper is delving into the kinds<br>of tourism<br>scenarios that destinations might want<br>to consider<br>as they design experiences for<br>tourists coming back to the destinations<br>after we've rethought tourism<br>and there are many many many possible<br>scenarios i categorize them here in<br>in four different categories in the<br>orange bubble on the left<br>first we have experiences that bring<br>deep<br>human connectivity the creation of touch<br>points<br>where tourists and residents can come<br>together for deep sharing of culture<br>traditions beliefs<br>and lifestyles and storytelling and<br>folklore become very important there<br>the second category are those that bring<br>the tourist into a deep connectivity<br>with the environment with nature with<br>the animals and so on<br>designing spaces where this can happen<br>having the interpretation the deep<br>education<br>that can allow us to learn more from<br>nature about how to live<br>uh in this world the third category very<br>important is to<br>create and design experiences that can<br>engage<br>the tourists in contributing back to the<br>destination and we're seeing more and<br>more of this<br>people are less interested in pure<br>hedonism and want to somehow<br>help to regenerate the destinations they<br>love<br>and then the fourth category of uh<br>experiences that can be designed<br>to help lift the consciousness of<br>travelers<br>are those of self-reflection and<br>self-inquiry<br>this can be in any of the other three<br>categories<br>it can be in solo experiences in the<br>wilderness<br>it can be in retreat centers but<br>whatever it is<br>giving a chance for tourists to reflect<br>back on who they are and their<br>relationship back to society<br>so anybody who would like this paper um<br>i'd be happy to send it if you just put<br>your email address in the chat box<br>i'll share the whole paper with you i<br>just only had a minute or two to share<br>some details but in closing i just like<br>to re-emphasize that i think the rethink<br>that we all need to do is perhaps a<br>re-feel as much as a rethink<br>uh that we need to come back to those<br>basic human values<br>and nurture them in all the stakeholders<br>the tourists<br>and the decision makers as we redesign<br>and hopefully<br>look to the future with less luggage and<br>some optimism<br>for tourism as we move into the next<br>phase thank you very much<br>wonderful thank you very much pauline um<br>a great<br>and very broad perspective on<br>reimagining which i think is really<br>really inspiring many interesting points<br>are in there and i would also like to<br>congratulate pauline on the best<br>background that is actually not virtual<br>it's real so i think next time we should<br>all be<br>zooming from uh from hawaii wonderful<br>thank you for setting the scene and<br>i would now like to<br>introduce associate professor anika<br>who will be talking about indigenous<br>tourism<br>wairua and the nature human<br>interconnection<br>thank you ian thank you christian<br>abby and colette for hosting me and<br>greetings to everybody it's lovely to<br>see some operators names pop up in the<br>chat<br>um i'd like to just give you a quick<br>overview if i could have the first slide<br>christian please i might need prompting<br>to say next slide<br>cura so i'm really<br>um setting this presentation within the<br>context of indigenous tourism<br>but i'm wanting to go beyond tourism to<br>the fact that<br>when we look at tourism spaces they're<br>not just tourism spaces and places like<br>community spaces and places they're our<br>cultural landscapes<br>and the tourism sector in new zealand<br>has really embraced over the last 20<br>years<br>maori values there's been a lot of<br>nurturing of maori tourism<br>operations we have the new zealand maori<br>tourism<br>association winter and wonderful<br>operators<br>who i'd like to acknowledge as having<br>gone through quite a hard time in the<br>last<br>three months and i'll just quickly say<br>good<br>speed with the next wee while<br>but i want to go beyond what have<br>traditionally been embraced is maori<br>cultural values within<br>our tourism industry we've had a lot of<br>focus on manakitanga and kaityakitanga<br>behind those values we have these deeper<br>values<br>associated with matarangamari regarding<br>kawa cultural practices and tikanga or<br>cultural principles<br>and some of those principles and<br>understandings around wairua or<br>spirituality<br>the maori of place have been<br>emerging in interviews i've conducted<br>with<br>kaita operators and<br>community members in a number of<br>research projects over the last<br>few years more so um<br>in the past few months since we emerged<br>out of lockdown where i was able to<br>re-engage<br>with a number of operators<br>and community members from kai tahu<br>between poketaraki down to rakiura<br>and i'd like to acknowledge them in the<br>kaitaku people with this opening slide<br>as well<br>because it is in a way their knowledge<br>that i'm bringing to this discussion<br>so the the theme of indigenous tourism<br>and flourishing<br>and the need for resilience that<br>we will be carrying forward with us that<br>need to embrace culture and traditional<br>values<br>or our own histories and our own<br>heritage is becoming<br>quite prominent during this pandemic as<br>people are really reflecting on where<br>they're from<br>and in many senses our connections to<br>our family and our friends the fauna<br>the need to be community in nature<br>nature-centric has given<br>people a way of<br>finding solace and positivity as they're<br>during the past few months we actually<br>managed to get out and about and conduct<br>interviews<br>with nature tourism operators primarily<br>otipotti and we were looking at<br>their relationships of the natural world<br>particularly with wildlife<br>and many of them felt that even though<br>their tourism businesses<br>had ceased or been mothballed in<br>operation<br>it went beyond that tourism space into<br>that space of<br>nature where that relationship had to<br>continue no matter what<br>even if they were restrained in terms of<br>travel<br>many of them discussed the<br>fact that they used that time for<br>planning and resetting<br>the way they re-engaged with nature<br>post lockdown they could prioritize<br>their katayakitanga aspirations<br>during their time so what was a negative<br>time ended up actually being an<br>opportunity to go forward so this<br>presentation will present a few quotes<br>and look at how they cope with the<br>pandemic<br>through being strengthened by these<br>traditional values<br>but also looked at ways of delivering<br>a number of outcomes not just from the<br>tourism<br>component of the settings that they work<br>in but also the fact that these<br>intertwine with the<br>the wider society that we're within<br>the educational the health outcomes the<br>wellness outcomes<br>so most importantly you've got a common<br>discourse that's happening about nature<br>human connection<br>but within the maori space the<br>realization that<br>as human beings but also<br>in terms of our relationship with place<br>there's this acknowledgment that we're<br>wanting to restore the mana<br>the maori the spirit by acknowledging<br>the wairua<br>that quintessence of a place<br>and entity and<br>the fact that we're all connected and<br>that there's always a spiritual aspect<br>what is going on in the ewe domain<br>when it comes to how you manage the<br>environment but also how you manage<br>our relationships in our workplaces is<br>quite significant<br>and having a<br>an aspiration of hopefulness<br>positivity is of course quite a struggle<br>at times<br>such as during the pandemic many of<br>the operators we connected with found<br>that<br>even though they had their work reduced<br>they could continue in a voluntary<br>capacity maybe home based maybe<br>outdoors in close proximity to their<br>home<br>spaces to actually<br>continue with this means of connecting<br>with nature<br>and considering ways of restoring and<br>acknowledging the wairua<br>of the spaces that they belong in<br>and then also considering how they might<br>share these spaces<br>once we start reconnecting with others<br>in the community<br>particularly travellers other kiwis or<br>new zealanders<br>and then hopefully in the future<br>international travelers when our board<br>is reopened next slide please christiane<br>kiera<br>so from pukakura taira head one of our<br>participants<br>really contemplated about how no matter<br>where you were on the planet it is all<br>linked<br>when you talk about our whakapaka papa<br>it goes back to iraqi<br>and the rain that falls the naraki goes<br>down into the waitaki river<br>and flows down into here and potentially<br>links us back to the mountain<br>without us having to go to the mountain<br>that is the link of maori going both<br>ways<br>so this acknowledgement that we actually<br>have<br>the ability to connect with places<br>without having to travel to them and we<br>still have a responsibility<br>as katayaki as guardians to those places<br>the kaiti yakitanga and katyaki roles<br>that marihav<br>of course extends to pakiha and new<br>migrants<br>to aotearoa so we are all<br>increasingly finding ways of enhancing<br>natural biodiversity and there's some<br>fantastic examples around the country<br>such as the taranaki maula project<br>which is in my own rohi and where i grew<br>up<br>and was fortunate to work in my early<br>years<br>where this is engaging with<br>predator-free new zealand<br>aspirations and predator-free taranaki<br>is a place of transformation but in fact<br>the entire tiwa<br>namu the south island within the<br>kaitaku rohi a lot of emphasis around<br>the otago coastline<br>are sites where they've been increasing<br>engagement through our t3t partnerships<br>with the treaty of waitangi<br>the naitahu settlement act whereby<br>the the people<br>are engaging on a number of levels of<br>local government<br>and central government the department of<br>conservation<br>to look at ways of restoring the maori<br>the traditional values for places some<br>of these places are quite contested<br>with pukakura kairai ahead of course<br>there's been a huge change in the<br>management of<br>that place with the pukakura head<br>reserves management plan being worked<br>together with department of conservation<br>koroko karate trust and dunedin city<br>council<br>to actually look at ways of restoring<br>the cultural values<br>but there are still some contentious<br>issues around the management of<br>access to the whenua the landscape where<br>some of the eb would perhaps like to go<br>to but because of the nature of that<br>wildlife reserve<br>there's actually a situation where<br>access<br>is not possible as freely as i'd like<br>so one of our interview participants<br>mentioned<br>making a plan about how they could<br>restore the maori<br>how to restore that environmental and<br>cultural essence<br>to the area by enhancing the environment<br>and the habitat but also by re-engaging<br>and having more of a physical presence<br>there<br>in being more regular in terms of their<br>engagement at the site<br>they express the need to ensure that<br>their efos that comes from ourselves as<br>kai tahu<br>is to leave the venue in a better<br>condition than when the responsibility<br>was passed back to them and that<br>includes everything that was living upon<br>it the plants the animals<br>the penguin the toroid the royal<br>albatross and the other bird species<br>next slide please christian<br>so what are some of the ways that<br>there's been this connection with<br>cultural values and and what i call<br>ancestral ways of knowing<br>um but also reflecting on your own inner<br>well-being as a person as a tourism<br>operator<br>as a tourist as a community member<br>living in areas where there are these<br>shared spaces of tourism activity<br>alongside living communities who have<br>strong interests in what is happening in<br>the management<br>of tourism and recreation in these<br>places<br>in deep place deep place based learning<br>is one way<br>and this sort of echoes what pauline<br>wonderfully outlined in terms of<br>interpretation<br>slow tourism connecting in a more<br>meaningful<br>and mindful way so<br>some of the ways this has been done<br>quite successfully within the maori<br>space has been through<br>wananga or schools<br>workshops around natural resources<br>when it comes to interpretation of<br>landscapes and cultural values korong<br>hikoi or walking and talking the land<br>particularly with<br>rangatahi or the youths who might not be<br>employed within a tourism space but<br>tourism goes out and touches their<br>community it might be a place that they<br>might go<br>to there's a strong need to identify and<br>restore these places and share these<br>spaces<br>to share identity narratives around<br>whakapapa or ancestry<br>the histories the myths and the legends<br>and the potential for future linkages of<br>the cultural landscape or the phenomena<br>so our work is to try and enhance the<br>environment to increase the maori<br>increase the life force of this place<br>for our ancestors<br>and our mokopuna so the<br>intergenerational needs<br>next slide please christian<br>so transforming tourism responsibly<br>the regeneration of place and the<br>resilience of place in human communities<br>are really important i<br>i wanted to finish just with some bullet<br>points about<br>the need to look behind or beyond the<br>product and the economic outcomes<br>and to really look at going<br>beyond our traditional neoliberal<br>approach<br>in terms of seeing a site as a product<br>to be developed<br>really i'd like to see and i think this<br>is being expressed in documents such as<br>the mb<br>and doc new zealand altera government<br>tourism strategy<br>a situation where we're planning not<br>just for tourism but for leisure<br>and recreational opportunities cultural<br>engagement and biodiversity<br>opportunities<br>and so we're very blessed in altera that<br>this diversity of<br>outcomes that ultimately<br>contribute to environmental and human<br>health and well-being<br>are being discussed openly at a possible<br>at a policy level<br>and being enacted within policy<br>documents such as the 2019 tourism<br>strategy<br>which will no doubt be revisited and it<br>sets a platform for long-term engagement<br>with landscapes and ecosystems that<br>enable local and traditional knowledge<br>it goes beyond co-management of<br>teteriiti partner values<br>to the point where you're getting<br>situations where we're looking at<br>management of these landscapes going<br>back to the manufenua to the people<br>themselves<br>ideally future tourism and visitation<br>will be<br>informed by matarangamari tikanga and<br>kawa the protocol there'll be meaningful<br>relationships<br>with maori communities who are restoring<br>the manner of these landscapes<br>and the visitors and the tourism<br>actors who go into these areas<br>recognising engaging these communities<br>through maybe shared governance<br>through handing the governance of the<br>hour the manga<br>and other protected areas back to the<br>eevee themselves as has happened in the<br>urawera<br>so this is particularly important when<br>we're looking at<br>not just stock i feel that docs<br>shouldered a huge responsibility<br>but with local authorities as well as<br>large corporate players in the tourism<br>sector<br>so just the final slide um<br>i'd just like to finish with this<br>proverb<br>care for the land care for the people<br>and go forward everybody<br>anna thank you very much for that also<br>very exciting and very interesting<br>presentation which<br>makes some interesting linkages to to<br>pauline's so clearly there's a<br>there's a strong theme coming through<br>that<br>seems to be growing also looking at this<br>from a new zealand perspective and<br>how lucky we are to have this indigenous<br>knowledge that can help us<br>reframe some of the challenges we are<br>facing<br>wonderful thank you very much and i<br>would now like to<br>hand over to our final speaker professor<br>ken<br>chewie who will be discussing<br>whether our new responsible tourism<br>runs the risk of reverting back to the<br>irresponsible tourism<br>great thanks to you all huge thanks to<br>pauline<br>and kia ora anna really good to see you<br>there<br>i just wonder if i could connect with<br>you for a second anna about<br>your metaphor i'll call it a metaphor in<br>pakiha terms<br>um around our rocky mount cook<br>and the connection with the flows from<br>the mountain<br>through the waitaki river to the sea i<br>personally think the flows go a whole<br>lot further because of course<br>our rocky mount cook is the home of the<br>water which generates<br>one-third of new zealand's hydroelectric<br>power<br>so that water in effect goes to every<br>home<br>in new zealand so we're all connected<br>to our rocky mount cook and we all<br>should be thinking about the phenomena<br>so<br>so thanks anna and and kia ora for that<br>so i do want to make another thanks<br>to my colleague susanna beckham huge<br>thanks susana you might be skiing down<br>at queenstown today i'm not too sure<br>uh but if you're watching this a big<br>thanks for your help um today<br>also i think there are some doc<br>colleagues online and um<br>i i saw lanell uh post there earlier on<br>great to see you there lanell<br>i'm going to be talking i guess at what<br>i might<br>call a slightly higher level<br>so sort of thinking about the national<br>level<br>about policies and about directions<br>particularly from an<br>altearoa new zealand context so i want<br>to throw up some challenges<br>i want to throw up some opportunities<br>and then a potentially sad<br>conclusion let's hope it's not the case<br>so this is what confronts most of us now<br>at airports not so much<br>in new zealand in the last month or two<br>uh pauline might have observed but we<br>have<br>entered a potential second wave in the<br>last couple of days and<br>some pretty sad um aspects of of that<br>space<br>but nevertheless from an international<br>perspective that's pretty much what<br>we're seeing but it's not what we saw<br>so so if we think about um<br>nz inc and about the sort of reliance<br>that we have had in terms of the<br>tourism space then it was little<br>surprise that the parliamentary<br>commissioner for the<br>environment was able to predict without<br>knowing that covert was on the scene<br>that we would probably move from around<br>about<br>three and three to four million tourists<br>per annum up to about six million<br>tourists per annum by 2030.<br>my how that picture has changed today<br>but will that picture change in terms of<br>thinking 2030 unless we make these<br>fundamental changes<br>that you've both been talking about and<br>many of us<br>aspire to what the graph shows here<br>are some other attributes of what maybe<br>over tourism did to us<br>yes we were attracting many tourists but<br>from an economic perspective pure dollar<br>point of view<br>we weren't getting the return or yield<br>per tourist that we probably should have<br>been<br>so we fell into that trap of lay the<br>goose laying a golden egg<br>but the golden egg not really delivering<br>what it could have and should have for<br>the new zealand economy<br>but more so to many other aspects of the<br>new zealand economy<br>and at the same time it delivered a<br>significant contribution to greenhouse<br>gas<br>emissions and to our co2 emissions<br>and to lots of other environmental<br>and so if we think a little bit more<br>about<br>where we flowed over the course of time<br>then we really got to a critical<br>point in terms of path dependence and<br>that dependence<br>locked us into a form of tourism which<br>probably wasn't the form of tourism that<br>now we might aspire to<br>and many of us in fact have been<br>aspiring to for a decade or more<br>the sorts of tourism that anna and<br>pauline<br>have been promoting and i think we<br>should be<br>promoting as well into the future so<br>that's unlocking ourselves<br>out of path dependence moving into path<br>breaking<br>and thinking more about diversity of<br>opportunity<br>probably within in my view a much more<br>holistic sustainability<br>frame of the world next slide please<br>and so we got to 100 um queenstown<br>full and that had many many implications<br>it had implications for the local<br>community it in effect<br>displaced the local community it's led<br>to housing challenges<br>and airport discussions which i'll move<br>on to in a few moments<br>so we talked pauline about new zealand<br>being 100<br>pure uh we talk about clean and green<br>we've talked about a whole<br>lot of other metaphors that we've used<br>in our marketing space<br>and queenstown still has attributes uh<br>that are in those sorts of spaces<br>but really queenstown is now at that<br>juncture<br>but as an added little insight and i<br>might just say this i was<br>listening to our director general of<br>conservation last night who's been on<br>annual leave in the southern lakes area<br>and over the course of the last month or<br>so<br>many businesses have in fact been<br>thriving in that area<br>the ski fields have had record numbers<br>of people<br>new zealanders are being tourists<br>domestically<br>in vast numbers and i know myself<br>my family my brother my friends susanna<br>beckham who's down there<br>they have been taking part in this<br>tourism and<br>in fact assuring that many of the places<br>that we thought were over<br>over tourism are in fact back into<br>over tourism so what's changed next<br>so there's a whole lot of old thinking<br>versus new thinking and i see we're<br>getting into that sort of debate<br>into that juncture where we're having<br>some healthy debates<br>but we're also potentially locking<br>ourselves<br>into business as usual so<br>the discussion around a new airport at<br>terrace which is a relatively short<br>drive from dunedin is really something<br>that<br>i'll be honest and to be a little bit<br>um non-pc<br>scares the hell out of me it really<br>scares me for a whole lot of reasons<br>about what we are trying to do with<br>tourism<br>in new zealand but it also raises a<br>whole lot of other issues as you pointed<br>out<br>anna that we've been really investing<br>and i think quite hard<br>and i think doc works really hard in the<br>space not all the time successfully but<br>i think it works really hard<br>in trying to make sure that we work with<br>manufenua<br>that we create the opportunities and<br>that we try and deliver a sustainable<br>product<br>but that sustainable product is<br>increasingly challenged by these other<br>challenges of more and over tourism<br>and the cruise industry was a classic<br>example of that<br>we just allowed it to build and build<br>and build and build and build<br>until it blew up as a result of covert<br>but where will the airports leave us<br>i think there's a few things we can be<br>thinking about<br>in terms of trying to maybe turn the<br>tide<br>in terms of maybe thinking more<br>holistically and thinking of a way that<br>we can<br>actually move forward from where we are<br>at the moment<br>i hear really very little discussion at<br>the moment<br>about new zealand's commitment to the<br>tiaki promise<br>yet to me that was a really promising<br>initiative<br>where is it at the moment anna where is<br>it pauline where is it christiane<br>has it died a natural death or are we<br>going to promote it into the future<br>was it just a slogan and it's so<br>sloganistic<br>sort of initiatives that really worry me<br>and really enforce a concern<br>or reinforce a concern that i have that<br>we might go back to business as usual<br>my second point is there's a lot of<br>thinking occurring both globally<br>and in new zealand and in new zealand<br>particularly led<br>out of the ministry for the environment<br>that we should be setting this sort of<br>promise<br>within a planetary boundaries approach<br>there are limits to growth and we<br>totally exceeded those limits<br>what can we learn about restoring<br>tourism to sit within those sorts of<br>limits<br>and then if i think about what our prime<br>minister in her speech from the throne<br>talked about around about three years<br>ago then it was about<br>being within a well-being framework it<br>was about<br>situating altea row in new zealand into<br>the four well-beings<br>and again i think in part we haven't<br>really grasped that opportunity<br>and covert both creates an opportunity<br>but it also creates a risk that in<br>trying to emerge from<br>covert we will press the economic first<br>button<br>at the expense of the other well-beings<br>so there are some risks<br>and then finally i see the need to be<br>thinking about some just<br>transitions and again our focus in new<br>zealand<br>aotearoa probably anna particularly in<br>terms of your home<br>area of taranaki which has been very<br>reliant on the oil industry for a long<br>time<br>where the focus has been on adjust<br>transitions to new industries new<br>manufacturing and new opportunities<br>then what does just transition look like<br>in terms of the way we think about<br>tourism going forward<br>do we let some of our investments and<br>sunk<br>investments in terms of tourism um<br>do we let them die or do we subsidize<br>them into the future which might then<br>lock us back into businesses<br>as usual i see this these as really<br>tricky<br>questions and ones that we're really<br>hopeful that new zealand will think<br>about further<br>the conclusion and it's a bit scary<br>because i do think<br>that there are enormous pressures to<br>safeguard<br>and build business as usual and while<br>that<br>might be seen as an economic way forward<br>to me<br>it's not responsible it's irresponsible<br>i'll leave it at that thank you very<br>thank you very much ken and another<br>excellent presentation that hopefully is<br>getting<br>everybody to really think about where we<br>are<br>where we're heading and more importantly<br>where we want to be heading<br>as a country and as a tourism industry<br>so three fascinating perspectives i can<br>see<br>quite a few parallels i have to admit<br>running through all three of them<br>which i think is encouraging because if<br>academics can see<br>similar issues then that's already<br>reassuring<br>and that there isn't too much dissonance<br>or disagreement between the academics<br>so i would now like to um open this up<br>for discussion so<br>with the q a of course we have a voting<br>system and the the one<br>question that has so far attracted the<br>most interest<br>i will read out and then i will pass<br>this<br>out to the speakers and i'll try and<br>start with ken<br>but please feel free to jump in after<br>i've read it out<br>so chris roberts presumably from tiaa<br>says connected tourism is something that<br>international visitors before the<br>borders closed<br>when crazy increasingly interested in<br>sadly kiwis not so much<br>new zealanders generally don't use<br>guides in their own countries so miss<br>out on the stories<br>and the deeper understandings that can<br>be offered to our international tourists<br>so question to you ken how do we get<br>locals<br>to get connected so they learn more<br>deeply about<br>all these stories that our international<br>what a wonderful question uh chris<br>roberts and thanks very much and and the<br>others who raised that<br>i think it's true um but actually i<br>think it's breakable<br>and i think it's doable so i'm a bit<br>mindful of<br>visiting kate raenger a couple of years<br>ago with my wife<br>and we were shocked i was saddened it's<br>one of the great places<br>to visit in altia roa in new zealand and<br>and we were saddened<br>um by the lack of connection amongst a<br>whole lot of kiwi visitors who were<br>there<br>who just seemed to want to eat their<br>cold fish and chips by that point have<br>their radios blaring in their ears<br>and doing a whole lot of other behaviors<br>that i thought<br>were not consistent with the four<br>well-beings<br>and maybe a sense of cultural tourism<br>and connectedness so if i think about<br>the work that we are trying to do within<br>the department of conservation to papa<br>artify it is about<br>creating the opportunities um<br>for all tourists to learn in that sort<br>of space<br>and i think what we're now seeing is<br>that and with the re-emergence of<br>tourism<br>in queenstown and the southern lakes is<br>that in fact kiwis are taking up those<br>opportunities<br>and they are seeing the potential to<br>learn in that space<br>i do think though there's a lot more<br>opportunity to do better so i might just<br>finish at that point christiane because<br>i'm sure anna's got some views on this<br>thank you um yes anna and i will hand<br>the next question to pauline in a minute<br>but anna cura um<br>i had a similar experience at tereranga<br>wairua caprianga ken<br>um coming back to chris's question i<br>think this is where we have to think<br>beyond<br>tourism and the tourism space and to me<br>to change the new zealanders attitudes<br>and engaging<br>people in our tourism spaces in a more<br>mindful way it goes back to the school<br>system and our education system<br>and i actually feel that not only at the<br>tertiary level but the secondary and the<br>primary school level<br>there's a fantastic work being done in<br>the education system but when it comes<br>to<br>tourism delivery i feel that<br>some of these places could actually<br>engage more with our communities through<br>our schools<br>embracing the power of children and i<br>think<br>heike schuntzel's watching this but<br>embracing the the power of children and<br>family tourism<br>within those spaces could be one of the<br>approaches that could be made<br>um hence kaitahu they're doing a lot of<br>work with waninger<br>and so these tourism spaces are also<br>community spaces<br>broadening our thinking of planning<br>beyond tourism planning<br>integrating of leisure recreation<br>education<br>at all levels that's one potential<br>possibility from my perspective<br>cura and if i may just add a a personal<br>thought as well i think<br>doesn't it start with our curriculum in<br>schools and our history curriculum that<br>until now has been muted<br>and has now finally been given the<br>opportunity to be more<br>inclusive and more holistic because<br>surely that will cede some of those<br>initial interests as anna says so<br>yes very good question by by chris now i<br>would like to<br>pose a question to pauline<br>by simone and she said why should host<br>communities anywhere in the world invest<br>time and resources in such an intensive<br>form of tourism<br>as i think you proposed in your<br>framework there are<br>or will be again billions of travelers<br>in the world surely host communities<br>cannot sustain this<br>this is something i've been grappling<br>with for a long time now<br>so basically how can communities<br>thank you for that question simone yes<br>it's it's not an easy<br>solution but just a few comments that<br>that question<br>raises in me first of all i don't think<br>that<br>necessarily that intense kind of<br>tourism you know does require a huge<br>amount of resources on the part of the<br>community<br>yes it can but we have to think about<br>you know what are the numbers going to<br>be like in the future<br>you know can we assume that we're going<br>to have billions of travelers and i<br>would i would question that i really<br>would um<br>we are thinking in hawaii right now i've<br>heard some of the local people<br>saying who is it we want to invite back<br>to the islands not<br>you know just letting anybody who wants<br>to come come but having some selective<br>um<br>criteria and that's a whole different<br>mindset i know<br>from what we used to market market<br>market and bring all of the people<br>in so so that's one thing second thing<br>that i would like to comment is you know<br>when we look at alternative experiences<br>they can be simple they don't have to<br>uh take a huge amount of human resources<br>i don't if any of you study what they're<br>doing in amsterdam in holland but<br>there is a group of people there who are<br>putting out these amazing touristic<br>experiences that<br>provide environmental or human<br>connectivity at almost no cost<br>for example in one case you can go<br>fishing for plastic and<br>in the canals uh you know rather than<br>fishing for fish and depleting the you<br>fish for plastic and you<br>so so so it's it's simple it's a simple<br>example um<br>you can quote unquote marry a tourist<br>for the day excuse me a resident for the<br>day or for a couple of hours and and<br>spend some time with them so<br>so i think you know we have to shift our<br>mindset a little bit<br>um think what value it is we want the<br>tourists to bring and what resources<br>you know we we're willing to to utilize<br>to do that because<br>in the bottom line if that experience<br>can somehow regenerate<br>the destination whether environmentally<br>or culturally whatever way<br>isn't that worth it so i think it's a<br>different mindset<br>and i think we won't be looking at the<br>huge numbers that we have in the past at<br>least for a very very long time<br>thank you great question and some some<br>wonderful examples from<br>amsterdam which is also trialling the um<br>donut economics as one i think of the<br>first<br>urban destination so really trying to<br>think<br>outside the box um and now i would like<br>to um<br>read out a question from johan edelman a<br>taffy colleague of ours who's i think no<br>longer lapland<br>now i believe he's in japan if i'm not<br>mistaken<br>so he's saying thank you pauline and<br>anna um<br>in my respect here initially to johnny<br>admins who has shared so much knowledge<br>with me<br>so johnny um was the director of the<br>world indigenous tourism alliance who<br>passed away earlier this year and<br>has been working with with many of us so<br>thank you for acknowledging that johan<br>question then mostly to anna traditional<br>values ancestral ways of knowing and<br>walking to reclaim place and sharing<br>narratives<br>have all in common the wonderful<br>connection that one can have with land<br>and acknowledging the wealth of<br>knowledge this can mean<br>however at the same time it might feel<br>exclusive to people<br>who do not have traditions ancestors or<br>places to reclaim<br>surely we all have those somewhere but<br>we might not be based where our<br>ancestors<br>live in or where are mixtures of people<br>who never have lived<br>where the families was from and that is<br>the reality<br>for an ever larger part of the<br>globalized world's community so<br>basically displacement<br>increasing mobilities so how can the<br>hospitality of communal values<br>be presented so that they are not about<br>insiders and outsiders<br>where can the bridges be built so that<br>the sharing and understanding<br>that exists so that was a i literally<br>read that out and<br>i think it hopefully now makes sense to<br>most people so<br>all these changes and not always knowing<br>where your roots are<br>can we be inclusive i suppose<br>i mean it's that's a huge global problem<br>isn't it it's<br>one where i think you know<br>having to approach things kindly and<br>thoughtfully<br>and respecting each other is you know<br>they're quite soft<br>values but they're quite meaningful<br>especially at times like this<br>i'm i mean this raises to me a more<br>important topic that we<br>are quite infatuated with tourism<br>management<br>and to me tourism is a privilege to<br>partake in<br>it's having strengthened communities and<br>we're fortunate to have communities and<br>homes<br>our biggest challenge to me is refugee<br>crises<br>and i've mentioned this before in other<br>webinars i i wish i had time to work in<br>the space i feel like i need to move<br>into that space but<br>but the dispossessed the people who may<br>not have had<br>an experience of colonisation but<br>through warfare<br>or disposition of lands and place spirit<br>through disaster<br>or human induced disaster<br>is something that i feel really has to<br>be<br>touched on with regard to belonging<br>and it's a privilege to belong somewhere<br>these days<br>i don't really have a simple answer to<br>how bridges can be built<br>but if you went to the textbook then it<br>would be through interpretation<br>through slow deep learning connecting<br>with place<br>getting out and learning about your<br>environment and your community<br>and giving back to those places i always<br>feel that volunteering within<br>communities<br>but also not rushing and taking the slow<br>approach to your travels<br>or your visits is the way to go<br>and we've had a huge resurgence of<br>volunteering<br>within tourism spaces in aotearoa which<br>i think<br>we're very lucky for but i'm conscious<br>that elsewhere in the world it's not<br>possible<br>thank you christian thank you johan<br>lovely to see your question<br>and it's one that i can relate to very<br>personally<br>being a british person living in in the<br>middle of the pacific in hawaii<br>but one thing i wanted to say is that i<br>think<br>if we bring our awareness to the to the<br>universal level<br>and realize that we can all learn<br>from the ancestral ways of different<br>communities and traditions<br>then yes there's a there's a uniqueness<br>when it's our own ancestry<br>and there's a real resonance with that<br>but i think we<br>we can all uh become larger become<br>bigger<br>as we look at and study and engage with<br>the traditional values of every culture<br>wherever we are and of course that's the<br>the beauty of tourism<br>so yeah wonderful<br>um i'm mindful of of time and<br>i have um literally gone through the<br>questions as they<br>uh as they were voted for in terms of<br>popularity there are many more questions<br>and i'm sure the speakers would love to<br>see them and ponder them afterwards so<br>we will<br>be sure to share them um but<br>just on closing i would like to<br>read out the question from freyja from<br>australia so this has truly been an<br>international<br>webinar who says that one of the kanaki<br>mauri values mentioned is disrupting the<br>status quo if the transformation is to<br>be more than a niche<br>disruption of businesses as usual is<br>vital<br>and i think that's probably not a<br>question we need to answer but<br>recognize yes we do need to really<br>address<br>reimagining the business as usual which<br>as ken said might<br>sleep seep back in because for many<br>people it is about<br>survival which we also have to<br>acknowledge and it is very dangerous and<br>very difficult to find<br>that balance so we do need to push<br>against business as usual<br>this i think also something i'm taking<br>out of all the different presentations<br>we need to truly be willing to rethink<br>so i would like to thank the three<br>presenters<br>ken pauline and anna and<br>i would like to thank the organizing<br>team and i'm sorry ian for organizing<br>this<br>and bringing
