next presentation is going to<br>come to us from fiji so i'm going to<br>hand over<br>to my colleague dr donald wilson<br>dr dr wilson is the associate dean<br>research at the college of medicine<br>nursing and health sciences of the fiji<br>national university<br>and they have a live audience in suva<br>over to you donald<br>thank you jackie william from sioux fiji<br>at the college of medicine nursing and<br>health sciences we are fortunate to have<br>this<br>partnership with the otago global health<br>institute<br>and we're very happy that we can join<br>this webinar series<br>and we're also very happy that today<br>fiji is able to present its status as<br>far as kovid 19<br>is concerned and we're also very happy<br>this morning<br>that we have one of the very key people<br>on the incident management team of<br>of the kovit 19 response for fiji<br>and her name is on the program so<br>without further ado i'll invite dr<br>alicia<br>khan uh who is the acting head of health<br>protection<br>at the fiji cdc uh to take us and tell<br>us the story about how fiji handled<br>kovit<br>okay and thank you dr wilson and thank<br>you<br>to everybody here at the pacifica<br>auditorium at fiji national university<br>and also to the otago global health<br>institute for the invitation to tell<br>a bit of fiji's story and our experience<br>with uh covet 19.<br>um so i'm dr alicia khan i'm the acting<br>head of<br>health protection with the ministry of<br>health and medical services<br>here in fiji i'm one of<br>over 6 000 healthcare workers in fiji<br>who have been working extremely hard<br>to tackle this outbreak and i'm also<br>part of the leadership<br>team at the ministry of health and<br>medical services<br>so the title of my talk is how did fiji<br>beat covet 19<br>so this is a very out there and<br>ambitious uh topic<br>for sure we don't actually like to say<br>that we beat it<br>because as long as covet 19 exists in<br>the world it's a threat to fiji so we<br>like to say<br>that we have it contained how did fiji<br>contain covet 19<br>so just a quick background if you're not<br>familiar with fiji our population<br>during our last census in 2017 was 884<br>887 whereas a group of islands of<br>over 330 islands in the south pacific<br>um so far with covert 19 we've had 18<br>confirmed cases our first case was<br>on detected on march the 19th<br>and our last case was detected on march<br>the 18th<br>we've had no deaths to date thankfully<br>or intensive care unit admissions and<br>according to the who<br>our transmission classification is<br>sporadic cases so this is just one level<br>below<br>below what no cases so these are<br>countries with one or more cases that<br>are imported or locally detected<br>just to note that all of our 18 cases<br>have either been<br>directly related to travel so people who<br>have traveled overseas notably um<br>all of our travel related cases have<br>come from australia<br>new zealand or the united states or they<br>have been close contacts of these travel<br>related cases and in one case<br>it was a close contact of a close<br>so just an outline of my talk today um<br>i will be talking about fiji's response<br>and delving a little bit into our<br>preparedness and response plan<br>and then go through a timeline of key<br>events that<br>shape the response to the outbreak<br>then a little bit into the public health<br>interventions including the<br>non-pharmaceutical interventions that<br>were key to containing the outbreak<br>a brief epidemiological overview<br>and then a question about lab testing is<br>fiji testing enough<br>because this is a is this a question<br>that frequently frequently comes up<br>in the public and in in the media<br>um then we'll go into key components of<br>effective response in fiji<br>first looking at our preparedness and<br>response plan<br>so there are seven key components of<br>this plan<br>and i won't go<br>in depth into every single component i<br>will be highlighted in specific parts of<br>the talk<br>but by far you found that the most<br>important component was command and<br>coordination<br>establishing a command structure very<br>early<br>and being able to coordinate not within<br>just within ministry of health and<br>medical services but across<br>or through an all of government response<br>and we're very fortunate in fiji that we<br>had a very<br>um our leadership right to the top<br>levels of government our honourable<br>prime minister frank weinerman<br>really took great interest in the<br>response to covet 19<br>and particularly was very receptive<br>to the leadership of the ministry of<br>health in<br>directing that response we were very uh<br>fortunate in that regard<br>of course um the surveillance risk<br>assessment<br>and response was a key part of the<br>action plan laboratory services<br>clinical case management infection<br>prevention control<br>public health interventions risk<br>communication and logistics procurement<br>and supply management<br>all key key parts of the response and<br>within our response plan we really<br>structured our response based on<br>two strategies for responding to this<br>outbreak<br>one was containment and this is based on<br>scenarios<br>based on how many cases we were having<br>and then moving to mitigation<br>we're thankful that we never had to move<br>beyond containment<br>so within campaign the containment our<br>scenarios included<br>our first cases and then having small<br>and and the strategies to deal with this<br>were the strategies that i'll be um<br>detailing after this but then also that<br>we have the third scenario of multiple<br>clusters which we<br>haven't gotten to yet thankfully but<br>this is important because moving from<br>containment to mitigation if some<br>some of you would remember right in the<br>beginning of the outbreak<br>worldwide the pandemic it was recognized<br>that once you break containment<br>really your resources become stretched<br>to the point where mitigation is the<br>only option<br>so we were determined right at the<br>get-go from our first<br>case that we would not we would try very<br>hard not to go beyond containment<br>understandably we're a low middle income<br>country we're a small island developing<br>states<br>we've state we've all heard of the very<br>famous<br>concept of flattening the curve well<br>why are we trying to flatten the curve<br>we're trying to get<br>below the threshold of what our health<br>system can deal with our health system<br>capacity<br>and we know in low lmics<br>that threshold is much lower than in<br>high income countries<br>so we had a much higher i think<br>level of response in terms of action<br>once we got our first case and i will<br>talk about this a bit more later<br>when we had our first case that was our<br>trigger for very rapid and stringent<br>action<br>and this is in contrast to a lot of<br>other countries in the world who had a<br>bit<br>of a bit of a higher tolerance they may<br>have gone beyond a hundred cases<br>beyond a thousand cases before they did<br>really put in a lot of um<br>measures public health measures that<br>were actually quite disruptive<br>so this is um just a quick timeline of<br>some of our key events just to show you<br>tell you how early we acted so our<br>national health corporate 19 task force<br>was formed<br>at the end of january and we're very<br>glad that we formed this task force<br>because it was a very much a<br>multi-sectoral<br>task force that included the ministry of<br>health academia including of course<br>donald wilson<br>from fiji national university the<br>private sector<br>and development partners including<br>the espc so this task force was<br>still is in existence and it is very<br>much a brain's trust<br>that advises on policy health related<br>policy advice<br>for the the outbreak then on the 24th of<br>january there was a multi-agency<br>steering committee<br>that was inter-ministerial shared by the<br>permanent secretary<br>for health and medical services and this<br>reported directly<br>to the fiji government's cabinet<br>on the 2nd of march an incident<br>management team was established now this<br>team was key<br>because it essentially was<br>used to really focus resources within<br>the ministry<br>on corvid 19 while being able to<br>maintain<br>normative functions within the ministry<br>of health so our current<br>uh recent acting permanent secretary<br>of health and medical services dr james<br>fong was<br>was the general manager of the incident<br>management team until this week<br>and it was really we found that it was<br>really important to implement that<br>structure that was<br>was also um advised by who because it<br>would really help with the coordination<br>between ministries it did not just<br>include ministry of health staff<br>it also includes second bees from<br>different<br>um ministerial portfolios<br>in february march to march before we had<br>our first case we were very busy<br>preparing that is just a<br>just a handful of the guidelines that we<br>put together<br>and there was of course corresponding<br>training that went with<br>along with it one of the key trainings<br>that we had in early february was the um<br>uh training for the public health and<br>primary care response to covert 19.<br>so this is this is in early february<br>well over a month before our first<br>case so we were very aware that<br>preparedness was<br>key to responding because we did expect<br>to get cases<br>on the 24th of um this this timeline<br>looks a bit more at our border measures<br>we found that border control<br>shutting our borders of course was<br>something that really did<br>help in the containment of this disease<br>in fiji so from the 24th of<br>january there were travel advisories<br>issued to fijians advising first against<br>travel to the hubei province<br>this later expanded to include all of<br>mainland china<br>by the 28th of january we began symptom<br>screening of passengers<br>arriving at our international airports<br>and we<br>implemented a supplementary health<br>arrivals card on the 2nd of february<br>by the 2nd of february we had prohibited<br>foreigners<br>entering fiji who had been in mainland<br>mainland china within the last 14 days<br>this exp this restriction expanded to<br>italy iran south korea<br>spain usa in the united kingdom as the<br>pandemic progressed across to these<br>countries<br>any fijians returning from these<br>countries were required to home<br>quarantine for 14 days<br>by the 16th of march we had banned all<br>cruise ships from entering fijian waters<br>by the 26th of march this is after our<br>first case was confirmed on the 19th of<br>march<br>all international air and seaports were<br>shut down<br>and water the borders were closed to<br>foreign travelers<br>we still kept accepting of course our<br>fijian citizens coming back into the<br>country<br>and yachts were banned by the 30th of<br>march<br>by the 28th of march we had compulsory<br>quarantine and government designated<br>quantum facilities and this was mainly<br>repatriated um<br>asian citizens right from the beginning<br>this was managed by the republic of fiji<br>military forces and by mid april we had<br>mandated<br>testing at after day 14 of quarantine<br>for all<br>of our repatriated citizens in the<br>um looking at budget and legislation so<br>we were given a recovery 19 response<br>budget<br>by the fijian government of 14 million<br>in addition to the current ministry of<br>health budget<br>on the 29th of january of course we<br>declared novel coronavirus<br>2019 nkov as it was called at the time<br>as a national notifiable disease and we<br>did amendments to the public health act<br>to make um<br>certain uh violations enforceable as<br>well as increase penalties which were<br>quite<br>archaic based on the previous<br>legislation<br>these are some key achievements in<br>health system strengthening that was<br>part of our<br>preparedness and response plan lab<br>testing began in fiji<br>on march the 11th at the fiji cdc this<br>is our only molecular<br>testing lab and we use of course the<br>real-time rt pcr<br>and then recently we had we've started<br>gene expert testing both which are<br>molecular methods<br>and it remains the only testing facility<br>for copper 19 in fiji<br>there was also identification of<br>hospital and community isolation<br>facilities<br>for covert 19 and there was more than<br>200 beds prepared<br>for an influx of cases of covert 19<br>with the intent to have 50 isolation<br>beds in each division at any one time<br>we're thankful that we did to date we<br>have not uh had to utilize<br>most of that capacity we also upgraded<br>our intensive care unit with the<br>necessary<br>necessary equipment for managing severe<br>cases of probio 19 including<br>ventilators and recently the evo<br>machines that were<br>looking at public health interventions<br>it's<br>not much different to what we know we<br>should be doing what other countries<br>have done<br>successfully worldwide key to our<br>response was<br>early detection testing isolation of<br>cases<br>tracing off their contacts and<br>quarantine<br>this is the same thing that has been<br>done in many countries that have<br>successfully contained covert 19.<br>we also implemented lockdowns but our<br>lockdowns were<br>specific to geographical areas so when<br>we<br>were based on an assessment of the risk<br>of a spread of those cases so when we<br>got our first case in lotoka<br>we decided um our second city to lock<br>down lotoka city for at least<br>one incubation period to allow our<br>contact tracing teams to find all<br>contacts and to assess whether there was<br>into and of course in those lockdown<br>areas everything but essential services<br>were running<br>for the rest of the country there was<br>our essential services continued most<br>businesses did continue<br>although at times there were there were<br>slowdown of businesses just to try and<br>commute<br>reduce that community transmission of<br>course social distancing and hygiene<br>just some key statistics when it comes<br>to our contact tracing<br>and quarantine so by the 11th of may<br>there were more than<br>4 000 direct and casual contacts of k of<br>our 18 cases<br>that have been followed up and assessed<br>also we<br>had screened over 96 percent of our<br>population<br>through our mobile fever clinics or our<br>fixed fever clinics<br>so the intent of these fever clinic<br>clinics was actually to<br>find people who meet our case definition<br>copy 19<br>and test them if they do meet our case<br>definition<br>what we found in some of the lockdown<br>areas is that when we set up fixed click<br>cleaver clinics<br>we weren't getting the numbers that we<br>did we would have expected<br>people visiting the clinics with<br>symptoms so this was really uh reaching<br>out<br>going out into the community to find<br>more cases active<br>case detection if anybody met our case<br>definition at the time which<br>was uh at that time was um travel<br>history with<br>corporate symptoms or contact with the<br>case with corporate symptoms<br>they would be swab tested for carbon 19.<br>of course the vast majority of the<br>people in this group were not<br>were not actually tested it was a purely<br>a screening program<br>we've had approximately close to 3 000<br>international arrivals which are mostly<br>repatriated citizens<br>who have been quarantined in government<br>designated facilities<br>so just looking at a brief<br>epidemiological summary<br>of our cases to date so we have had 18<br>cases<br>all have recovered we've had no deaths<br>it's now as of today it's been 67 days<br>since our last case<br>and 97 days since our first case<br>that is our epic curve of course and<br>you'll see that uh<br>peak followed by a sharp decrease and<br>then a breakdown<br>by uh division if you look at the age<br>group<br>distribution you'll notice that most of<br>our cases where in the younger age group<br>um<br>in the 20 to 29 but of course because we<br>had so few cases it's difficult to<br>extrapolate anything from this data<br>11 of our cases were female and seven<br>were male<br>all of this information is available on<br>the fiji governments<br>website<br>i would like to bring up this topic a<br>bit because<br>quite frequently in a low middle income<br>country<br>when it's reported that we have so few<br>cases and no deaths<br>quite often the uninformed view is oh<br>so so i'm going to go through a few<br>different questions or topics<br>first of all how much is enough believe<br>me i've looked<br>i've looked through all the guidelines<br>all the protocols are available through<br>who and other agencies<br>there is no number for what is enough<br>and a famous epidemiological<br>answer to questions like that is well it<br>depends<br>and well it depends on what well it<br>depends on the size of your outbreak<br>depends on your level of transmission so<br>the country with the most number of<br>tests right now is the united states it<br>tested over 20 million people<br>but does that mean that taking that<br>metric alone does that mean that they<br>have good control<br>we know by looking at other metrics that<br>no that's not true<br>so i'll be talking a little bit about<br>that um<br>delving into how much we're testing<br>other metrics for testing including test<br>population test positivity test per<br>confirmed case<br>how frequently we're testing and who<br>we're testing so this is just a<br>breakdown of our<br>of our testing to date well actually of<br>um<br>this this is a bit this is a week old<br>data<br>so as of june the 14th we have done over<br>4 000 tests<br>our test per population is uh 4.7 today<br>we've<br>as of today we've done about 4 500 tests<br>and it's over five per<br>1000 population we're doing we were<br>doing about 100 tests<br>a day um about a week ago<br>and about 500 over 500 tests a week<br>our test positivity has been at 0.4<br>percent of course because we haven't had<br>case in over 60 days and we're doing<br>about 225<br>tests per confirmed case so these are<br>some key metrics<br>if you want to look at how much we're<br>testing compared to other countries<br>so this is uh courtesy of our world in<br>data and i've just added in fiji's<br>information<br>so fiji is in this category down here so<br>the below<br>10 per thousand tests so<br>you'll see some countries are doing an x<br>a a<br>large number of tests up to 60 and 70<br>per thousand<br>australian new zealand are in that<br>category of testing<br>something else you'll notice is that the<br>countries that are doing this level of<br>testing<br>are high-income countries so that leads<br>us to the question<br>is it only high-income countries that<br>have successfully contained<br>or flattened this outbreak or flatten<br>the curve<br>and have all high-income countries been<br>so just narrowing down to these<br>countries who have done less than 10<br>tests per thousand population and this<br>is the category that fiji is in<br>and you'll see some of the countries<br>that are in this category are quite<br>surprising<br>japan is there taiwan is there we know<br>that taiwan in particular has done has<br>been very<br>successful in containing their outbreak<br>uh vietnam is also there they're another<br>low middle-income country that has been<br>very successful in containing their<br>outbreak<br>so obviously just looking at tests<br>number of tests and test for population<br>is not a good measure of whether you<br>have<br>contained your outbreak or how good your<br>control is<br>so what else can you use so first of all<br>um i love this quote by an economist<br>when a measure becomes a target it<br>ceases to<br>ceases to be a good measure if you're<br>just going to rely on tests<br>number of tests you really<br>you will not be doing a good job in<br>seeing how well a country is containing<br>the outbreak so this is directly taken<br>from the john hopkins<br>university chronovirus resource center<br>site<br>and then said that testing programs<br>should be scaled to the size of the<br>epidemic<br>not the size of their population and<br>looking at the positivity rate is the<br>most reliable way to determine<br>if a test if a government is testing<br>enough<br>but again we go back to that quote if<br>the<br>measure if the measure becomes the<br>target<br>it no longer beca is a good measure so<br>you'll<br>so basically what i'm trying to say you<br>need to look at a few different metrics<br>before you can make a judgment um on how<br>well a country is doing in terms of<br>containing an outbreak and whether<br>they're testing enough so if you look at<br>our positivity rate this is fiji as of<br>15th of june we're at 0.4 percent<br>and this is the same as australia or new<br>zealand who of course are doing<br>much more tests than we are right at the<br>bottom of the graph you see brazil on<br>the 29th of<br>may their positivity rate was at about<br>90 percent and we know that they are<br>having a terrible time<br>another measure of course is total<br>number of tests per confirmed case and<br>this is literally the inverse of the<br>positivity rate<br>so trying to see how many um tests you<br>are doing<br>in order to confirm one case of um<br>carbon 19<br>again fiji is at 225 so just behind<br>australian new zealand and above<br>um taiwan at 165. and<br>again brazil is right at the bottom of<br>um that graph<br>so what these measures test positivity<br>and test per confirmed case<br>could indicate is that you are testing<br>widely enough<br>to be picking up not just the people<br>that are most likely to have covet 19<br>but also those who are less likely to<br>have corvid 19. so if you're getting a<br>test positivity of 50 percent<br>it's likely you're just testing those<br>most likely so in<br>places like new york city for example at<br>the height of their outbreak their test<br>positivity was between 50 to 70 percent<br>once they increased testing and expanded<br>it beyond<br>just hospitalizations that of course<br>decreased<br>so what that indicates is that your<br>final number<br>of your total cases that you pick up is<br>more likely<br>closer to the true number than if you<br>but that's not enough as well as looking<br>your test at your total number of tests<br>or a test for population<br>and your test positivity and test for<br>confirmed case<br>how frequently are you testing because<br>you can just test<br>a large number of people at one point in<br>the outbreak and you get great test<br>positivity but if you're not testing<br>regularly<br>how are you monitoring your outbreak so<br>this is looking at<br>fiji's test per day since june uh as of<br>june the 14th and you can see<br>that we've been testing daily um and our<br>tests<br>have actually increased our test numbers<br>have actually increased since our last<br>cage which<br>case which was on 19th of april so we've<br>actually increased the testing<br>even though we've had no cases reported<br>and this is just looking at the test per<br>week<br>and then of course as well as how<br>frequently you're testing<br>who are you testing because with test<br>positivity<br>if you really wanted to um i guess game<br>the system<br>you could just target a group of people<br>you pretty sure don't have covet 19<br>and that will lower your test positivity<br>so<br>you need to know who a country is<br>testing<br>so first who does who say we should test<br>so who bases their advice on<br>who should be tested on the level of<br>transmission<br>so no cases versus sporadic cases versus<br>community<br>community transmission so who recommends<br>that all suspected cases should be<br>tested for coping 19<br>applauding according to the whole case<br>definitions which i will<br>briefly describe later if you have<br>surges in influenza like illness<br>that should be investigated all context<br>of cases should be investigated and<br>tested<br>and it's a similar for sporadic cases as<br>well<br>there's not much difference between the<br>testing between report<br>countries with no cases versus sporadic<br>cases except there's an<br>emphasis on investigation of those cases<br>and the testing of contacts<br>and then with clusters of cases<br>and community transmission of course<br>they recommend that you<br>upscale testing because of course you'll<br>have more suspected cases<br>and looking this this is the case<br>definition for suspected um<br>cases from the who so basically it's<br>anybody with an acute respiratory<br>illness with a history of travel<br>to a place that has community<br>transmission anybody who has had contact<br>with the case<br>and anybody with a severe acute<br>respiratory illness<br>and an absence of alternative diagnosis<br>and admitted to hospital<br>so what is fiji doing who are we testing<br>we're following the whole criteria<br>for our suspected cases we've got two uh<br>two criteria criteria for testing one is<br>category 1 suspected cases<br>which is the who criteria but expanded<br>so that is anyone with international<br>travel and history of<br>illness of severe acute of acute<br>respiratory illness anyone who's been a<br>contact<br>a healthcare worker who's been caring<br>for cases<br>and is has now got symptoms<br>and then expanded even further so<br>asymptomatic close context of covet<br>cases asymptomatic healthcare workers<br>who've completed 14 days quarantine<br>after caring for carbon 19 case<br>and then we've got a second category<br>well beyond the who<br>testing recommendations for sentinel<br>surveillance<br>in fiji any adult patient admitted to<br>hospital for an acute respiratory<br>illness is tested for covet 19.<br>we've also identified high-risk groups<br>so that so if anybody in this<br>group who has an acute respiratory<br>illness should be tested for covet 19.<br>so that's healthcare workers<br>institutional residents including in our<br>corrections facilities<br>and then in the general population we're<br>taking random samples from sentinel<br>sites across<br>fiji for people presenting with acute<br>respiratory illness just to see if<br>there's any ongoing<br>so that's an overview of who we're<br>testing how often we're testing how much<br>we're testing and how we compare to<br>other countries who have also contained<br>or very close to containing covert 19.<br>some other surveillance that we do of<br>course we watch our influenza like<br>illness trends we've got 68 sites across<br>the country<br>and our trend has been downwards and we<br>are now at the end of our flu season<br>severe acute respiratory infections of<br>course anybody admitted to an icu<br>with a severe acute respiratory<br>infection has been tested<br>and then we are monitoring our<br>hospitalizations for acute respiratory<br>illness which have also been<br>so that's my spiel on testing um i'll<br>just<br>talk a little bit about what we have<br>noticed about<br>what are really key components of an<br>effective response<br>again we're a low middle income country<br>we're very restrained in our resources<br>but what we have noticed a similarity<br>between us and other comparable<br>countries<br>is early and rapid response we acted<br>before our first case we were preparing<br>well before our first case<br>but we responded decisively and swiftly<br>with our first case we did not wait to<br>res uh<br>to build up to 100 cases or more we<br>responded with our first case<br>leadership is key having an<br>overall leadership a government that<br>listens<br>to science listens to the advice of<br>medical advisors<br>is key and it also um<br>reinforce the the buy-in<br>of other agencies so if you had the<br>honourable prime minister of course<br>leading our press conferences and<br>pushing the response<br>you had a lot of buy-in and a lot of<br>cooperation<br>to respond decisively and of course the<br>all of government response and<br>coordination which is very<br>key and evident in our incident<br>management team<br>and then not only last but not least<br>with the development partner assistance<br>we have a great relationship with the<br>world health organization<br>and development partners including the<br>australian and new zealand governments<br>the pacific community and other<br>governments and agencies that have been<br>helping throughout this response<br>particularly<br>in issues such as procurement of lab<br>testing consumables<br>now my last slide is a very short and<br>simple slide<br>it's where to next living in a postcard<br>with 19 world<br>and i don't have much any detail on this<br>slide because really it is it's an open<br>question<br>there's no blueprint there's no<br>guideline from where we go from here<br>as a corbett 19 contained country we're<br>existing<br>we've done very well we're in a position<br>that a lot of countries would envy<br>but where to next how do we do more than<br>exist<br>in a postcard 19 world how do we live<br>and that's something that we're<br>grappling with right now<br>sorry sorry thank you alicia um jackie i<br>know that we<br>are three minutes after one<br>uh and i know that we had agreed that we<br>do five minutes of answer questions from<br>here and then the rest you can take on<br>the<br>questions that are streaming through on<br>your side<br>uh how would you want to do this<br>and donald i hope you can hear me yes i<br>can hear you can you hear me<br>yeah yeah i think just go ahead with<br>your live questions and we have had a<br>few questions coming on the q a here<br>um but we won't do those we will just uh<br>put those in writing for<br>for our speakers so go ahead with your<br>live session donald<br>all right thank you thank you anyone<br>yes<br>hi dr alicia and uh everyone who's<br>listening up<br>uh this is taina i teach at the medical<br>school in missoula like to commend the<br>testing<br>and the work done by the ministry of<br>health and the<br>fiji cdc we've noticed that<br>the cases that we had were not<br>severe cases and introductions from four<br>different<br>countries so my question is um is there<br>plans or have you sent our samples for<br>sequencing to determine the strain that<br>we have we have important from these<br>four different countries<br>thank you taina and taina is a former<br>member of fiji cdc so we're very glad to<br>have that question<br>so as part of the who um part of the<br>assessment of us<br>as a testing lab for corvette 19 was for<br>us to send<br>our first few copied 19 positive case<br>samples<br>to the um who collaborating center<br>reference lab in melbourne australia<br>which is the<br>um video which is part of the peter<br>dottie<br>institute so we did send a few of our<br>first<br>samples they have those samples and more<br>recently<br>we've sent all of our samples to be<br>sequenced<br>yes<br>yes so so the question was about um<br>genetic suite sequencing of our 18<br>confirmed uh<br>case samples and the answer of course<br>was that yes we've sent them and we're<br>sorry uh jackie we've uh<br>would you want to go ahead with the<br>questions that are streaming i see that<br>there are several on the<br>um donald i think what we may need to do<br>is actually um<br>is go through your questions but perhaps<br>um for people who need to leave the<br>webinar just so they are assured that<br>those questions will be<br>in writing but you have a live audience<br>so i think let's prioritize that donald<br>okay thank you uh alicia thank you uh i<br>think just leading on from tayna's<br>question<br>is uh the 18 cases that we've had<br>uh and the duration of positivity<br>uh how do we explain the differences and<br>quite different among some about the<br>duration<br>okay so our previous<br>um discharge from isolation criteria was<br>that a person needed uh to have two<br>negative uh<br>um corporate 19 tests<br>within at least 24 hours<br>of each test before we would release<br>them from isolation and of course<br>all all of our cases were isolated in<br>hospital<br>so they were all hospitalized what we<br>found was that<br>we had a number of cases that had a very<br>long duration of<br>testing positive by rtpcr<br>our longest i think was over 70 days<br>um of course they were completely<br>asymptomatic by this time<br>and we really were being very cautious<br>we were using<br>more the asian guidelines of when you<br>should<br>release someone back into the community<br>since then of course<br>there's been a lot more evidence that a<br>positive pcr<br>after recovery after resolution of<br>symptoms is likely just<br>remnants of the virus not live virus<br>it's<br>dead virus um so we did a<br>a review of all of the evidence looked<br>at the guidelines<br>by different countries including<br>australia and new zealand<br>latest who guidelines that have come out<br>just in the last few weeks<br>saying very clearly that after<br>about 10 days of illness if a person<br>is asymptom completely asymptomatic they<br>should not be considered as infectious<br>so we have since revised our um release<br>from isolation uh criteria but yes there<br>was<br>there are a number of um our cases that<br>had a<br>very long period of where they were<br>still testing positive by<br>by rt pcr again acknowledging that<br>that is not a measure of whether they<br>were infectious or not or if they were<br>still<br>infected they were just having remnants<br>of the virus still detectable<br>yeah we're very sorry about the mic<br>situation here does anyone else have<br>another question<br>uh jackie i think we'll we'll hand over<br>to you i think jackie has said that<br>those all of those i can see that<br>they're 10 questions<br>uh that will be emailed to you uh<br>jackie i think uh for the in the<br>interest of time<br>uh we just before we handle it he would<br>like to also acknowledge uh the acting<br>permanent secretary of health<br>and the chief medical advisor who just<br>walked in but<br>thank you dr alicia and do you have any<br>questions for alicia from your side<br>jackie<br>hi there donald we have a few questions<br>um but i do think because we are out of<br>time and people do have tight schedules<br>i would rather just put those uh to her<br>in writing<br>um so as not to take up too much of<br>anyone else's time<br>you can feel free to continue with your<br>q a session in suva though<br>but i do need to actually bring our<br>webinar to a close<br>thank you so much for your participation<br>our fiji colleagues and also to dr dust<br>from the school of pharmacy<br>we will be back again for the next<br>installment<br>in the cover 19 master class tomorrow<br>from 12 to 1.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
