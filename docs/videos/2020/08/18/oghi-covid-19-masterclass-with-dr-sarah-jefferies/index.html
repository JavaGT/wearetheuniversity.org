surveillance and outbreak<br>response<br>she's been providing public health meds<br>and expertise on behalf of the ministry<br>of health<br>during new zealand's curve at 19<br>response including on national<br>surveillance planning<br>risk assessment and epidemic<br>intelligence<br>she will discuss national outbreak<br>epidemiology<br>sierra jeffries<br>no scotland ohio ksr<br>mahayana tenacotto hello my name is<br>sarah jeffries i'm a public health<br>medicine specialist they're based here<br>at the institute of environmental<br>science and research limited in<br>wellington we've been supporting the new<br>zealand minister of health with aspects<br>of the national covenanting response<br>and we as noted provide national<br>criminal disease surveillance public<br>health laboratory services and outbreak<br>investigation support<br>on behalf of the ministry of health and<br>today i'm going to give an overview of<br>the epidemiology of covered 19 in new<br>zealand to date<br>based on some of the surveillance<br>systems that we manage here at esr<br>hopefully you can see this slide um<br>that i have shared please let me know if<br>you do it have it<br>um so in this talk<br>i'll be providing some background to new<br>zealand's code 19 surveillance response<br>methodologies<br>then i aim to present the major features<br>of descriptive epidemiology in new<br>zealand including<br>the major person place time trends<br>identifying inequities where these exist<br>discussing the sources of infection<br>and providing an overview of the major<br>outbreaks and features of clinical<br>severity in new zealand's case cohort<br>and considering these in the context of<br>so on the 30th of january the same day<br>that the world health organization<br>declared<br>novel coronavirus a public health<br>emergency of international concern<br>new zealand made naval chronovirus<br>capable of causing severe respiratory<br>illness<br>legally notifiable under the health act<br>and this meant that suspected cases of<br>covid19 should be reported to a local<br>medical officer of health the criteria<br>for<br>defining suspected probable and<br>confirmed coordinating cases were set by<br>the ministry of health with advice from<br>technical advisor group<br>and the development of molecular<br>diagnostic testing for stars cov2 virus<br>convinced in january through the<br>coordinated efforts of the new zealand<br>microbiology network<br>positive test results could then be<br>directly electronically notified via<br>episerv<br>the online notifiable diseases database<br>managed by esr<br>and case data collected was performed<br>using the specific cover 19 case report<br>form and<br>a page from this form is shown here on<br>the right of the screen<br>this national case questionnaire was<br>developed<br>and adjusted in alignment with the who<br>report your requirements<br>and the surveillance priorities for the<br>country and other features of<br>surveillance<br>included in the response where the<br>outbreak surveillance which<br>includes acute respiratory infection and<br>cohort 19 outbreak reporting on episode<br>syndromic surveillance including severe<br>acute respiratory infection surveillance<br>in the auckland region<br>and whole genome sequencing which was<br>undertaken by the national virology and<br>sequencing laboratories at esr<br>i am focusing on notifiable disease case<br>based epidemiology in this talk which we<br>have been closely involved in<br>and i won't be touching on contact<br>surveillance and broader aspects of<br>cohort 19 in new zealand<br>and which will be covered elsewhere in<br>this lecture series<br>so just a summary for those perhaps less<br>familiar with new zealand that we are an<br>ethnically diverse population of<br>approximately five million people<br>with about three quarters of the<br>population living in the north island<br>with the highest population density up<br>here in the auckland region<br>new zealand has 20 district health<br>boards served by 12 public health units<br>which operate under the ministry of<br>health's guidance<br>i think it's really important at the<br>outset to acknowledge the skill and hard<br>work of new zealand's public health<br>professionals based in the ministry and<br>public health units around the country<br>during this pandemic response they have<br>a vital role in identifying and<br>interviewing cases and their contacts<br>and developing and applying appropriate<br>public health management<br>of course of course none of this would<br>be possible without the essential work<br>of the frontline and other healthcare<br>staff<br>clinical laboratories local communities<br>cases<br>their families or friends who<br>contributed to the new zealand response<br>so this is new zealand's national covert<br>19 epidemic curve to the 19th of june<br>for 1507 confirmed and probable cases<br>in new zealand to that time this shows<br>the earliest date that is<br>the illness onset date or case detection<br>date if cases were asymptomatic for<br>example<br>for all cases in new zealand to that<br>time key aspects of the timeline of new<br>zealand's national non-pharmaceutical<br>measures<br>are shown by flags for border travel<br>restrictions and shaded areas signifying<br>the periods<br>of degraded alert level based<br>interventions and these interventions<br>included progressive increases in social<br>and physical distancing measures<br>school and educational facility closures<br>the details of which are summarized in<br>the link on the slides<br>at the bottom there so new zealand's<br>response<br>was characterized by a rapid escalation<br>and over a 10-day period to lockdown um<br>with a peak of case presentations on the<br>23rd of march<br>as new zealand entered elect level 3<br>just before midnight<br>and cases then declined steadily through<br>lockdown<br>some major surveillance changes are<br>noted in the timeline along the bottom<br>and that includes the expansion of the<br>covenanting case definition<br>to include broader clinical<br>presentations and epidemiological<br>criteria<br>having initially been focused on more<br>febrile accuracy infections<br>uh presentations and travel from<br>affected areas<br>in general confirmed cases where people<br>who had code 19<br>confirmed by a laboratory test probable<br>cases were close<br>contacts of confirmed cases with<br>clinically compatible presentations<br>because the laboratory testing was<br>inconclusive<br>national testing capacity success me<br>national testing capacity significantly<br>increased around march the 16th<br>from approximately 100 tests per day to<br>approximately 1 000 a day<br>and by the 23rd of march had<br>approximately 2 000<br>um tests per day being performed across<br>new zealand<br>a large increase in testing was then<br>also seen<br>with surveillance case definition<br>expansion on the first of april<br>to an average of over 4 000 tests a day<br>and there were two large peaks and<br>testing<br>associated with targeted testing surveys<br>of asymptomatic and high-risk groups<br>and that was on the weeks of the 16th of<br>april and the 4th of may<br>with an average of over 5 000 and 6 000<br>tests taken a day so new zealand had<br>has had now among the highest rates of<br>so this epidemic curve shows the<br>geographic distribution of cases with<br>the colors representing the locations of<br>cases across the 20 district health<br>boards<br>and cases where detected throughout new<br>zealand in every dhb<br>and the geographic distribution is<br>influenced very much by the sites where<br>imported cases were most frequently<br>detected<br>and the sites were major outbreaks um<br>and most community<br>transmission occurred so on the chart<br>you can see a predominance of cases in<br>pink<br>and that's representing the southern dhb<br>and the auckland region in<br>various shades of blue and the white<br>cattle in purple<br>and so these were the areas with the<br>highest incidence of detective disease<br>this table shows the age distribution of<br>cases with<br>findings aligning with international<br>picture that copied 19 is less<br>frequently detected in children<br>which may be in part due to a tendency<br>shown in several studies overseas<br>towards children having milder clinical<br>presentations and being less likely to<br>be tested<br>you can also see from new zealand data<br>that higher incidence of disease<br>was seen in females young adults<br>um and people living in areas of lower<br>socioeconomic deprivation so the<br>lower deprivation um is represented here<br>by the new zealand deprivation<br>index at quintiles represented there<br>these overall characteristics reflect<br>the predominant characteristics of<br>imported cases<br>which made up a substantial proportion<br>of new zealand's cases<br>except however for the female<br>predominance so<br>the predominance of females as shown<br>here in the table<br>um is really a feature of the locally<br>acquired cases<br>and somewhat relates to the settings in<br>which locally acquired outbreaks have<br>occurred<br>this is new zealand's epidemic curve by<br>source of infection of the cases<br>so sources of infection were categorized<br>into four groups based on whether cases<br>could be epidemiologically linked to<br>international travel or not<br>case importation which means infection<br>which is likely acquired overseas<br>has been the largest contributing<br>category by source of infection<br>to the new zealand epidemic so far with<br>approximately 38<br>of all cases uh having been imported<br>as expected due to new zealand's<br>increasing travel restrictions<br>cases and returning travelers rapidly<br>declined early in the lockdown<br>from a peak of presentations on the 21st<br>of march<br>cases which emerged in the community<br>with no known source were very few in<br>new zealand<br>and these are shown in the orange color<br>on the graph approximately six percent<br>of all cases<br>the demographic characteristics of cases<br>varied by their source of infection as<br>noted<br>imported cases tended to be younger<br>adults um<br>and they tended to be europeans and of<br>higher socioeconomic status<br>locally acquired cases tended to cross<br>the spectrum of socio-economic<br>backgrounds<br>and showed female predominance with 30<br>with 63<br>of cases being female in no group for<br>maori new zealand's indigenous<br>population over-represented in disease<br>incidents among ethnic groups<br>and mary tended to have the lowest<br>incidence of disease among all<br>categories of source of infection<br>this is a rare good news statement for<br>infectious diseases in new zealand with<br>very often inequitably affected by<br>infectious diseases<br>and severe outcomes including from<br>previous pandemic<br>experiences today<br>approximately half of new zealand's<br>cases have been linked to 34<br>outbreaks around one-third of new<br>zealand's cases were a part of ten major<br>outbreaks i've overlaid<br>these outbreaks on this graph with a<br>period of illness onset<br>in the first to the last case for each<br>outbreak represented by the span of<br>vesicle bars<br>and the size of the major settings and<br>at the size of<br>the outbreaks and the major settings in<br>which they've occurred are also<br>shown here the vast majority of<br>outbreaks were initiated<br>by transmission events occurring prior<br>to lockdown most involved multiple<br>regions and the largest was associated<br>with a wedding<br>with epicenter and southern district<br>health board the second largest was<br>associated with the school in the<br>auckland region<br>and third with a hospitality venue in<br>the y cattle<br>all the outbreaks usually extended<br>outside of these settings including into<br>households<br>although these outbreaks span multiple<br>generations<br>due to lockdown and contact tracing<br>later cases tend to be<br>tend to be confined to household or<br>other known contacts who were in<br>quarantine<br>six of the top 10 largest outbreaks were<br>not linked to reported cases<br>so were considered locally acquired<br>there was marked female predominance<br>across all 10<br>outbreaks but this was most marked in<br>outbreaks involving institutional<br>settings<br>schools residential or aged care<br>facilities<br>and this reflected the higher prevalence<br>of females in these settings both staff<br>and residents<br>four of the top 10 largest outbreaks in<br>new zealand were associated with age<br>residential care facilities<br>due to the serious association that aids<br>residential care facility outbreaks have<br>had with severe covered 19 outcomes<br>overseas<br>the director general of health<br>commissioned reviews into the age<br>residential care outbreaks in new<br>zealand<br>and these were this review was recently<br>published<br>on the ministry's website of the 22<br>covert 19 related deaths reported in new<br>zealand to date<br>73 have been in residence of age<br>residential care facilities<br>household clusters are linked cases that<br>are confined to a single household group<br>and over half of the cases in new<br>zealand have been part of household<br>clusters<br>that's involving 323 households to date<br>this is expected giving the public<br>health measures in place during level 3<br>and level 4<br>locked down however very few have been<br>in cases<br>under 15 years old and only<br>approximately uh<br>four percent of cases have been uh<br>involved in household outbreak and only<br>five of those cases have been identified<br>as being<br>the first case in a household so this<br>fits the international picture of the<br>role of<br>a quick note on hold you know<br>sicknessing of the sars kobe 2 virus<br>and this is happening at esr the new<br>zealand viral sicknesses are being<br>uploaded to<br>a global open access database called<br>gized<br>and that's to facilitate for their<br>scientific investigation<br>the genetic data is being integrated<br>with epidemiological surveillance data<br>to support our understanding of new<br>zealand's<br>outbreak and the diversity of global<br>clays for stars kobe 2<br>and which is seen globally has been<br>mostly reflected in what we've sequenced<br>so far in new zealand<br>so far we've sequenced 667 samples<br>and that's with thanks to funding from<br>the ministry of health and<br>mb the majority of clays identified<br>have been of european origin and we're<br>seeing a similar<br>uh experience in terms of what australia<br>has seen<br>this graph summarized symptoms reported<br>for 1503 cases<br>as noted internationally febrile illness<br>does not feature in the majority of<br>clinical presentations of cobit 19<br>making 45 percent of the case cohere are<br>shown here<br>ili presentations which includes cough<br>and fever have also shown an even<br>even lower proportion of cases just 33<br>of cases<br>um in new zealand the case definition<br>focusing on<br>fever and travel history uh early in the<br>outbreak may have affected case<br>entertainment initially and of this<br>group<br>showing 51 cases were asymptomatic with<br>approximately half of them developing<br>symptoms<br>the incidence of severe disease has been<br>relatively low<br>among new zealand relative to other<br>parts of the world<br>certainly approximately 12 of australian<br>cases have been hospitalized<br>and that compares with approximately six<br>percent of new zealand's cases<br>cases who were hospitalized or died due<br>to cope with maintaining new zealand<br>were more likely to be older<br>with significantly higher proportions of<br>cases having severe disease outcomes<br>among those aged<br>groups 50 years and older versus the<br>younger age groups<br>this aligns with the international<br>experience as does a tendency for more<br>severe disease outcomes<br>to occur among cases with comorbidities<br>for 40 percent of cases with severe<br>disease outcomes has at least one<br>underlying condition<br>severe outcomes were more frequently in<br>cases reporting cardiovascular disease<br>including hypertension diabetes chronic<br>neurological or neuromuscular diseases<br>renal failure and pregnancy than those<br>who did not report these conditions<br>and please note though that this is an<br>unadjusted odds ratio<br>shown on the slide here and it's not<br>considered confounding by age for<br>example<br>preliminary motivate analysis<br>indicates that age and certain<br>competencies are likely to be<br>independent<br>risk factors for most of your clinical<br>outcomes or however<br>and that fits with the international<br>evidence<br>so there are updated graphics comparing<br>international rates of covered 19 and<br>deaths on new zealand covered 19 public<br>health dashboard which can be found on<br>esr's covered 19 response website<br>it also includes various summaries of<br>national case and outbreak data<br>presented in this talk and that's<br>updated daily<br>new zealand's curative rate of deaths<br>from kobe 19 has been among the lowest<br>in the oecd and similar to australia are<br>approximately<br>0.4 cases per 100 000 people which<br>contrasts starkly to the uk<br>which has had among the highest rates in<br>the oecd<br>and 63 cases per 100 000 people<br>countries with the lowest rates are<br>shown in the palest blue color<br>here and but as we know<br>international mortality comparisons are<br>affected by multiple factors including<br>testing rates healthcare access and<br>population aids structures for example<br>to briefly conclude new zealand's<br>initial epidemic wave of code 19 has<br>been characterized by<br>low incidence and severity relative to<br>the international experience<br>imported cases arriving new zealand<br>mostly prior to the lockdown<br>and locally acquired cases have tended<br>overall to have had<br>distinct demographic features and with<br>more severe<br>disease outcomes tending to be among the<br>locally acquired<br>cases and outbreaks household<br>transmission has been associated with<br>approximately half of new zealand's<br>cases and the largest outbreaks to date<br>have often involved institutional<br>settings<br>and finally with thanks to the multiple<br>organizations and colleagues involved in<br>the generation of these<br>surveillance data and intelligence some<br>links to<br>more information are also shown here in<br>this slide and<br>and i will leave it there for questions<br>thank you<br>thank you sarah we have one question<br>that's come through so far although i<br>suspect there may be more as we continue<br>um how did the patterns of course differ<br>or how were they similar<br>for children aged under 15 and for young<br>people aged 15 to 24.<br>so how are the patterns of was this<br>causes in terms of<br>presumably yeah so uh<br>so children didn't feature frequently in<br>terms of imported cases that was very<br>much the younger adult age groups<br>and children tend to be infected more so<br>in terms of the import related cases and<br>the locally acquired cases however<br>the total number of children affected<br>was quite low compared to the other age<br>groups<br>in the new zealand cohort and so very<br>much<br>in terms of the the major thrust of<br>infection it was<br>focusing more towards the um<br>younger adults in the imported cases and<br>in terms of other groups a range of<br>demographics but<br>moving towards older age groups<br>thank you and were there any<br>hospitalized cases for people under 15<br>years<br>do you have an age distribution for<br>hospitalized cases<br>icu and death<br>so there were um certainly hospitalized<br>cases<br>in younger age groups and so certainly<br>there was<br>small numbers in the infants and<br>and i think approximately um<br>150 cases under age 19 years of age<br>and so a small<br>proportion of the overall case um<br>cohort so probably approximately four<br>percent of cases<br>uh that were hospitalized where in the<br>that childhood age group<br>and in terms of the distribution of<br>other ages we've had um<br>the highest proportion of hospitalized<br>cases were in the over 50 year age<br>groups with approximately 20<br>of those aged 50 to 64 in that<br>hospitalized in that age group and<br>similar numbers for those<br>um in the older age groups<br>okay would you say that the number of<br>cases would have been lower<br>well it was very obvious great<br>answer to that question i mean we've had<br>um<br>38 of new zealand's cases were imported<br>and obviously the the disease<br>the virus had to enter via the border<br>and<br>i think that the decision to uh restrict<br>movement at the border is<br>uh has to be weighed against multiple<br>factors um<br>including negative impacts um<br>and indirect consequences of those<br>decisions and<br>so so certainly we would have had<br>more cases but i don't think that that<br>there was an obvious decision to close<br>at any specific<br>uh at any time before the sequential<br>closures that did occur<br>okay here's an interesting one would you<br>say that covert 19 is a virus of<br>lifestyle<br>as opposed to one of general<br>susceptibility for example<br>those with cardiovascular issues<br>probably smoked or had poorer diets or<br>exercise regimes and therefore we're<br>there are likely to be social<br>determinants<br>of poor disease outcomes in this<br>infectious disease as there are for<br>multiple infectious diseases and<br>the international evidence is suggesting<br>that you'll have<br>more severe outcomes associated if<br>you're in older age groups and do happen<br>to have comorbidities<br>um so certainly it appears<br>uh activities like smoking um<br>can increase your likelihood of having<br>more severe disease outcomes and so<br>that's certainly a<br>component of um the picture of what<br>we're seeing<br>in new zealand as well okay<br>um what was the distribution of the<br>cohort in terms of ethnicity by age<br>specifically<br>did maori and pacifica patients show<br>differences<br>in age compared to pikia and non-mari<br>patients<br>the numbers so i don't have the specific<br>numbers for that in front of me<br>unfortunately<br>and but there was a fair um<br>general distribution in terms of the<br>numbers of cases that were<br>locally acquired that were um maori and<br>pacifica<br>certainly the pacifica cases that were<br>locally acquired<br>and tended to be um more adults<br>and and that's very much relates to<br>the demographic features of the<br>picture of outbreaks that tended to be<br>locally acquired<br>and with certainly um<br>staff often affected in some of the<br>institutional settings<br>and in particular in those age groups<br>our next question relates to contact<br>tracing and we'll be looking at that<br>next week tuesday as well but i'll ask<br>you the question anyway<br>uh can you share how contact tracing is<br>done and what is the average turnaround<br>time for test results<br>right so contact tracing is<br>um undertaken in new zealand by public<br>health units and<br>by the ministry of health so there's a<br>national contact tracing service based<br>at the ministry of health<br>um as well and so essentially the the<br>aim of contact tracing<br>is to uh once the case has been<br>identified<br>really quickly identify who the contacts<br>of that case would have been while that<br>that case was infectious<br>in order to be able to apply public<br>health interventions so<br>so that involves a lot of work it<br>involves um<br>public health professionals interviewing<br>the case to get a really good history of<br>the people and the places that they had<br>come into contact with<br>during the period that they would have<br>been infectious and then<br>subsequently following up um with all of<br>those<br>different uh people that may have been<br>exposed in those areas<br>so there's a great deal of teamwork and<br>cooperation both from people and in the<br>community<br>as well as with the um public health<br>professionals to<br>find all these details and very quickly<br>respond<br>in terms of the test contact uh test<br>turnaround time<br>um i believe uh i probably can't speak<br>to that because i don't have the most<br>up-to-date<br>um times on that but it is<br>pretty quick i i know certainly at esr<br>if uh<br>if a sample uh arrives uh<br>then you can get a test in the same day<br>so um but i'll perhaps leave<br>more comments on that um to james usher<br>when he's<br>giving his talk later thanks sarah<br>you briefly mentioned the existence of<br>different clades of sars coronavirus 2.<br>to your knowledge is there any evidence<br>of differences in outcomes between them<br>not not to my knowledge but i am not up<br>to date on the most up-to-date evidence<br>in terms of that that is certainly<br>something<br>that um there are various research<br>projects being undertaken in new zealand<br>to<br>explore and esr is involved with one of<br>those<br>so to see whether there is any clinical<br>uh severity picture associated with<br>particular creates is something that we<br>are looking into and is of course of<br>okay now a fairly big one what do you<br>see<br>in terms of the future for covered and<br>government responses or policies for<br>mitigating<br>the option for government policies uh to<br>mitigate um future potential outbreaks i<br>mean<br>there's a there's a whole raft of<br>international experience<br>which is happening just now and emerging<br>evidence<br>from the various diverse ways that<br>countries are responding to this initial<br>covert 19 pandemic<br>and there of course has been some<br>initial success in terms of the<br>incidence and severe disease outcomes<br>relative to<br>other countries in new zealand with the<br>current strategies that have been<br>implemented and that was a really<br>fast and rapid um uh<br>gamut of various measures that were<br>implemented um<br>however there's there's much to be seen<br>in terms of what the flow and effects of<br>these decisions will be<br>and the options for um moving on<br>from this position and so<br>i think there'll be a lot of evidence<br>coming out from various countries which<br>will<br>um inform the future decision making but<br>certainly<br>and we have um got some interesting<br>findings from our own experience today<br>okay uh would you be able to comment on<br>the differences<br>in the duration of positivity of<br>so um only so much as to say<br>so i'm not a virologist but only so much<br>to do is to say that there is certainly<br>a<br>wide range of um positivity that has<br>been reported in new zealand and<br>overseas in terms of the duration that<br>we can detect<br>um rna so that's the genetic um<br>matter of the seroscope v2 virus which<br>is detected through the<br>um nasal swab test um<br>and it's not necessary<br>necessary though however that that<br>detection would represent<br>having a living virus and the ability to<br>transmit it<br>as well so there's more research that<br>needs to go into that to see<br>um what uh exactly the meaning of this<br>shedding is<br>um but in general shedding<br>you'll get a positive test and mostly<br>detected within that<br>first week of illness um with<br>some ability to detect the virus um<br>often prior to that<br>and and as we have demonstrated um<br>you can also detect it in asymptomatic<br>cases on occasion<br>thank you sarah i think that's all we<br>have time for today it's now 1 30.<br>um i'd like to thank all our speakers<br>and attendees for participating<br>the master class will continue tomorrow<br>12 noon new zealand time</p></main><footer style="margin-top:
