and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>welcome<br>my name is harleen hayne and i have the<br>privilege of being the vice chancellor<br>here at the university of otago<br>on behalf of the university it is my<br>pleasure to welcome<br>staff and students from around new<br>zealand and the rest of the world<br>who will be joining us for the next two<br>weeks as we host this covid master class<br>series of webinars i'd like to begin<br>by acknowledging the global health<br>institute here at otago who has taken<br>primary responsibility for organizing<br>this master class<br>in particular i would like to<br>acknowledge professor philip hill<br>who is the macaulay professor of<br>international health<br>this master class was his brainchild<br>professor hill dedicated this series of<br>presentations to our students here at<br>otago<br>who not only returned to campus as soon<br>as they possibly could<br>have also decided to stay with us over<br>the mid-semester break<br>in addition to organizing this master<br>class professor hill has provided<br>outstanding advice and guidance to me<br>throughout the pandemic<br>and i would like to publicly thank him<br>for his support<br>and his expertise<br>one hallmark of new zealand's response<br>to covid19<br>is that it has been evidence-based and<br>much of that evidence<br>has come from experts here at the<br>university of otago<br>experts from across the university have<br>provided advice to government<br>on diagnosis containment and contact<br>tracing of covid19<br>others are currently working on a<br>vaccine<br>in addition experts have provided advice<br>and commentary<br>on the impact of the pandemic on the<br>disability sector<br>on the economy mental health tourism<br>maori and politics<br>when the country was running short on<br>hand sanitizer<br>or swabs experts at otago set up their<br>own manufacturing organizations<br>across all four of our academic<br>divisions<br>experts have jumped in to provide<br>assistance<br>some of their assistance has featured in<br>the media while<br>others have helped quietly behind the<br>scenes<br>in short when the country needed help<br>university of otago staff rose to that<br>challenge<br>the contribution of otago staff has been<br>acknowledged by the prime minister<br>the director general of health the<br>ministries of health and education<br>and the dhbs in my<br>nine years of being the vice chancellor<br>here i have<br>never been more proud of this university<br>and today i am equally proud that these<br>experts have agreed to share<br>more of their time and knowledge and<br>wisdom with you<br>through this coven master class series<br>our experience over the last six months<br>has underscored the valuable<br>contribution<br>that university research and expertise<br>can make to the world in which we live<br>going forward at a tago we will continue<br>to be guided by our motto<br>audi dare to be wise<br>we will continue to assist where we can<br>in the fight against covet 19<br>and we look forward to contributing to<br>new zealand's recovery<br>we will also continue to conduct<br>world-class research<br>and the outcome of that research will<br>continue to be shared with the public so<br>that we can face<br>all of the big challenges confronting<br>our communities<br>teneto<br>thank you harleen i'm jackie hellingham<br>the manager of the<br>otago global health institute i will be<br>facilitating over the next 10 days<br>just to remind everybody that our<br>webinars are being recorded<br>and will be available on the website<br>afterwards<br>the format of the webinars is as follows<br>each speaker will deliver their<br>presentation<br>and you can type in questions to the q a<br>which you'll see at the bottom of your<br>screen<br>after the presentation i will read the<br>questions aloud and the speaker will<br>then answer<br>if we don't manage to get through all<br>the questions we'll email the speaker's<br>questions and written responses will be<br>up on the audrey website<br>as soon as possible our first speaker<br>this morning professor phillip hill<br>as harleen mentioned is the macaulay<br>chair<br>in international health at the otago<br>university<br>he's also a co-director of the otago<br>global health institute<br>and the center for international health<br>philip will be discussing<br>understanding global profit 19 health<br>statistics<br>everybody and i'd like to just<br>acknowledge all the other presenters<br>that are going to be speaking<br>we've had a fantastic volunteer<br>numbers of our staff volunteering and<br>also those<br>else from overseas as well<br>i'd like to have three aims for this<br>webinar the first<br>is to highlight four major issues to<br>consider when viewing the global covert<br>19 health statistics<br>the second is to briefly describe a few<br>of the other issues that are relevant<br>and then i want to illustrate how<br>understanding these issues can be<br>applied using examples<br>so the first issue is that testing<br>capacity varies<br>over time and geographically on the left<br>here we can see the number of tests<br>conducted<br>per day from late january to early june<br>in new zealand<br>horizon tests done reflects to some<br>extent the capacity to conduct<br>tests reaching about a thousand per day<br>and mid-march and rising to over eight<br>thousand per day<br>in mid-may also as shown on the<br>right-hand side of the slide<br>maximal test capacity varies greatly by<br>country<br>for example new zealand reach capacity<br>to do around 12 000<br>tests per day and liberia<br>although it has a similar size<br>population to new zealand<br>has reached capacity to reach around a<br>thousand per day<br>in terms of tests done per million up to<br>the 18th of june across different<br>countries<br>this varies greatly iceland<br>which is actually only ranked 10.<br>is ranked it has done a huge number of<br>tests<br>interesting the uk with its recent focus<br>on building capacity has now done over<br>100<br>000 tests new zealand is ranked number<br>36 and of great interest here on this<br>slide<br>is that japan has not actually done a<br>huge number of tests per 100 000<br>population<br>per million population and will return<br>back to this issue later<br>the second issue is the criteria for<br>investigation for testing<br>varies greatly over time and<br>geographically<br>so this slide shows an example of the<br>criteria for testing and the case<br>definitions used in new zealand<br>on the 2nd of march to get a test an<br>individual needed to meet both the<br>epidemiological<br>and the clinical criteria the empty<br>logic criteria will travel to hubei<br>or other areas with sustained outbreaks<br>within 14 days<br>before getting symptoms or close contact<br>with the confirmed case<br>the clinical criteria<br>required a person to have a fever plus<br>respiratory infection<br>plus at least one of shortness of breath<br>cough or sore throat<br>first of all one could argue that other<br>countries should have been specified by<br>early march<br>the statement was perhaps also too loose<br>but more interest though<br>was the use of this word and in red and<br>this means that the sensitivity problems<br>of each of the linked phrases<br>are at least partially additive so if<br>only<br>what 50 percent of cases have fewer have<br>fever<br>and only 50 percent have a shortness of<br>breath cough or a sore throat<br>then instead of picking up 50 of cases<br>you actually pick up<br>less than 50 of cases by requiring<br>people to have both<br>a cough and one of the other symptoms<br>mentioned<br>i remember looking at the european cdc<br>criteria around this time<br>and they use an or statement instead of<br>and<br>this means that you're likely to pick up<br>more than 50 of cases rather than less<br>as i've noticed here and was changed<br>to or on the 14th of march in new<br>zealand<br>also acute respiratory infection as a<br>statement is a little bit open to<br>interpretation<br>the upshot of these criteria is that<br>many people with covet 19 came into new<br>zealand february<br>and march were not actually diagnosed<br>as you can see also in this slide a<br>confirmed case<br>where's the arrow the mouse gun<br>here we go a confirmed case<br>is simply someone with a positive test<br>over april in new zealand we found that<br>we had 16 classes of covert 19<br>as described here in a table from the<br>ministry of health website<br>now while nine of these were able to be<br>linked to somebody sometimes not<br>previously diagnosed<br>who had arrived from overseas<br>for six shown here with the red dots<br>an overseas origin for any of the<br>cluster members was not identified<br>suggests that covert 19 at penn trade<br>had penetrated quite deeply<br>in parts of new zealand population<br>without necessarily being widespread<br>so let's pause to have a look at some<br>early notification data from china<br>here you can see the number of consumed<br>confirmed cases<br>that are test positive by day across<br>china from<br>mid-january to late february you can see<br>that on the x-axis<br>the red bars are the number of confirmed<br>cases in countries outside<br>china as one might expect with an<br>epidemic with exponential growth<br>and an increasing test capacity the<br>numbers were dramatically increasing<br>until early february<br>then a remarkable reduction occurred as<br>this can only be due to some sort of<br>intervention which is highly effective<br>something strange happened on the 17th<br>of february however as you can see with<br>this<br>large bar high bar here which actually<br>china decided to change its case<br>definition as it knew that it had many<br>more cases than were diagnosed by<br>testing<br>and had identified quite a specific<br>change on ct scan in the lungs<br>that made them confident of reporting a<br>whole lot more cases<br>however in my understanding it was<br>agreed to be able to monitor the trends<br>case notifications had to be restricted<br>to illustrate this further here's the<br>who notifica<br>notification data from hubei province<br>and the 10 other provinces in china<br>with the most cases as of march<br>3. the columns show<br>the population in tens of thousands in<br>the province<br>and the cases and deaths in the last 24<br>hours the total numbers are over here<br>over to the right i've calculated the<br>percentage of cases who died<br>you can see that hubei had case<br>much higher than the other percentages<br>indeed at the time<br>the case mortality outside hubei was<br>less than one percent overall<br>this difference is most likely because<br>only the sickest people in hubei got a<br>test<br>especially early on and all the mild<br>cases and those that didn't make it to<br>hospital were simply not counted<br>so the declaration of the thousands of<br>extra cases in the last slide<br>the high case mortality in hubei<br>compared with elsewhere<br>makes it obvious that there are a lot<br>more cases in china that meant the case<br>definition of who<br>anyone with a basic training in<br>epidemiology could work this out in<br>february<br>the fact that they built a huge hospital<br>in 15 days also made<br>the issue obvious that they had a large<br>number of cases<br>the third issue and this is the most<br>complicated slide<br>is that population age structures vary<br>greatly<br>this is important because young children<br>are probably less likely to get infected<br>and<br>less likely to be to get sick while the<br>elderly<br>and those with underlying health<br>conditions are much more likely to die<br>of cover 19. the median age of<br>populations across the world<br>varies greatly as you can see<br>italy's median age is 47 new zealand is<br>37<br>while in sub-saharan africa the median<br>age is actually only 18.<br>so one would expect countries in<br>sub-saharan africa<br>might have relatively low numbers of<br>while countries like italy and japan<br>might be expected to have high numbers<br>of deaths<br>however some calculations around<br>mortality are complicated someone might<br>have covert 19 which is not<br>life-threatening to them<br>and actually die of something else such<br>as a stroke but be recorded as a covert<br>19 death<br>we can then think of calculating what we<br>call excess deaths which is the deaths<br>that happen minus the deaths that are<br>expected<br>in new zealand we have about 750 000<br>people aged over 65.<br>often 27 000 die every year<br>if we have a covert 19 epidemic and 20<br>become infected<br>and 10 of these people died we'd expect<br>about fifteen thousand deaths<br>however the excess mortality would not<br>be fifteen thousand it would be expected<br>to be lower<br>however in some countries not all covert<br>nineteen deaths<br>are diagnosed or cases diagnosed<br>messing up these assumptions for example<br>from late february to late april italy<br>reported 26<br>700 covert 19 deaths when they compared<br>their overall deaths to the same time<br>the previous year there were 41<br>400 excess deaths<br>to illustrate some of these age issues<br>i'd like to give you some examples sorry<br>about the fuzzy nature of this slide<br>which is from the netherlands this is<br>dutch data from a few months ago<br>split by age groups down the left<br>as you can see there are very few cases<br>this is a number of cases here<br>in young children the next column is<br>hospitalizations<br>shows that there are also very few<br>hospitalizations in young children<br>and there were no deaths at all this is<br>the deaths here<br>right up to the age of 45<br>whereas case mortality the proportion of<br>reached over 10 percent in people over<br>70<br>and 20 over 20 percent in people in<br>their 80s<br>and these data are similar to data in<br>other parts of the world<br>another example is career and here you<br>can see the age groups<br>going the other way the youngest age<br>group<br>had very few cases had no cases at all<br>but very few cases and no deaths at all<br>right up to the age of 30.<br>and this is data on incidents<br>from france so this takes into account<br>the denominator population for each age<br>group<br>and you can see again these young age<br>groups<br>very few cases per 100 000 people<br>in those age groups indeed iceland did a<br>cross-sectional study<br>of active case finding in 3500 people<br>across their population<br>and they found 48 cases none of the<br>children under 10 were positive<br>so it's not just that children don't get<br>symptoms or don't turn up for testing<br>and here are specific age specific<br>mortality data from china<br>mortality and covert 19 cases reached<br>almost 10 percent<br>in people in their 70s and almost 50<br>percent<br>and people in their 80s<br>so you can see why countries with large<br>populations over 70<br>need to be careful to avoid the virus<br>especially in these subpopulations<br>even though overall in the whole<br>population the case mortality might be<br>one percent or less<br>and the fourth issue it's the varying<br>quality and capacity of health services<br>globally<br>the reason this is important is that<br>modern health care can reduce the<br>mortality quite substantially from<br>covert 19<br>especially through ventilators the<br>capacity of the health system is<br>overwhelmed<br>there will be a sharp rise in mortality<br>in terms of icu bets per 100 000<br>population<br>you can see that some countries are much<br>better positioned<br>with respect to ventilators than others<br>are hugely disadvantaged in this regard<br>so we haven't got time to go into a lot<br>of these ones in detail but there are a<br>number of other issues that may be<br>important<br>i think it's becoming increasingly clear<br>that<br>access to health care is important<br>people might not be able to<br>access good health care but some people<br>are avoiding going to the health<br>facilities that they regard as unsafe<br>some underlying medical conditions that<br>increase risk of death vary by country<br>population density is also important the<br>proportion of elderly and care<br>facilities varies social practices such<br>as hugging and kissing and<br>vary a lot basic hygiene climate<br>and bcg vaccine may also offer some<br>protection<br>but varies by different country also<br>it's becoming increasingly clear that<br>covert 19 epidemics<br>are based around clusters not so much<br>about general spread across the<br>population<br>and this has a number of implications<br>and death is delayed<br>so early mortality estimates can be<br>misleading<br>in the first few weeks now<br>this might be all sounding a bit<br>complicated so one way to consider a lot<br>of these things together is to use what<br>we call a cascade<br>of care approach so this is the cascade<br>of care for a hypothetical country<br>with 6 000 covert 19 infections<br>so let's say that 80 of these eventually<br>develop symptoms<br>but actually in in this particular<br>country only 3 000<br>actually seek care maybe only 2<br>200 can actually access a health care<br>facility<br>and then that health care facility only<br>recognizes a certain proportion and<br>tests<br>1500. the test is only 80<br>sensitive and then there's the problem<br>of reporting cases once you get the case<br>positivity<br>this means that in this particular<br>country which is hypothetical of course<br>only one in every six infections are<br>so if we assumed in looking at the red<br>here that one percent of infections<br>across a population<br>die through the cascade there's a drop<br>off in the proportion that end up being<br>notified<br>but since those who are sick are more<br>likely to seek health care and get<br>tested<br>the drop-off for those who eventually<br>die across the cascade is not as great<br>as other cases who are not as unwell<br>so together this leads to a relatively<br>high reported case mortality<br>four percent versus one percent but also<br>some deaths are still not reported so<br>a third of the deaths in this case are<br>not reported<br>so i'd like to close with a couple of<br>slides with three slides<br>of examples and we're going to look at<br>the hardest one first<br>africa and this is the who<br>situation report on one day the 18th of<br>june last week<br>so these are the top 16 african<br>countries<br>in terms of the numbers of cases this is<br>total numbers of cases confirmed<br>the rest of african countries have even<br>lower numbers of<br>cases of further interest is the<br>relatively small numbers<br>of deaths and the not ridiculously high<br>case mortalities<br>that are reported which i've put here in<br>red<br>indeed when i talk to people in several<br>countries in sub-saharan africa<br>they confirm that their hospitals are<br>not filling up with covert 19 cases<br>my feeling is that these data reflect a<br>relatively low testing capacity<br>the low median age of the population<br>across sub-saharan africa<br>some people are not seeking health care<br>even when sick<br>it's also possible that the huge number<br>of young people<br>in sub-saharan africa might be blocking<br>the virus being able to access their<br>elderly population<br>here in the americas i'd like to focus<br>on four countries<br>the higher case mortality of 5.5 percent<br>in the usa in the context of their<br>median age<br>the number of care facilities and the<br>high<br>icu capacity does reflect the likelihood<br>that there have been and remain a huge<br>population of<br>undiagnosed people<br>brazil also has a high case mortality<br>and likely has a large number of<br>undiagnosed cases<br>mexico may have just as many undiagnosed<br>nice coach<br>undiagnosed cases per population and has<br>a very worryingly high<br>case mortality canada also<br>being slightly smaller though has has a<br>very high case mortality<br>again suggesting that they have not<br>diagnosed a large proportion of their<br>cases<br>here i show some data from south east<br>asia and the western pacific region<br>according to who classifications from<br>the same 18th of june report<br>i'd like to highlight india and<br>indonesia and southeast asia<br>both countries appear to have not<br>diagnosed a large number of cases<br>and their low median age may be masking<br>this more than usa<br>for example interestingly<br>china has an overall case mortality now<br>of 5.5<br>which i think relates to the fact that<br>people who die tend to<br>to die several weeks after their initial<br>diagnosis<br>so the earlier slide showed an<br>underestimate especially for provinces<br>outside hubei<br>singapore has a reasonably large number<br>of cases but an incredibly low case<br>mortality of<br>0.06 that's 0.6 of 1<br>0.06 of 1 sorry this is certainly due to<br>the large proportion of their cases<br>and have occurred in young migrant<br>workers living in crowded accommodation<br>japan is a very interesting and<br>increasingly interesting story<br>they have not done a huge number of<br>tests and have not diagnosed a lot a lot<br>of cases<br>and they have a relatively high case<br>mortality<br>while they have missed a lot of cases<br>perhaps they have been quite<br>sophisticated<br>treating their epidemic more like a<br>cluster epidemic than a standard<br>epidemic<br>and they seem to be being quite<br>successful<br>japan's approach is going to be<br>something that's worthy of a lot of<br>attention in the future<br>new zealand has obviously done pretty<br>well but almost half our deaths have<br>come from one elderly care facility<br>and fiji is the standout performer<br>and i believe this result is genuinely<br>true we look forward to the presentation<br>from<br>our friends in fiji um in this master<br>class series<br>so i'd just like to close by giving you<br>a few of the websites that i've been<br>using and others i know have been using<br>um and there are other websites that<br>give a lot of information with respect<br>to cover 19.<br>and obviously these will show trends and<br>other things which i haven't discussed<br>thank you phillip question time<br>there have been a number of suggestions<br>that the chinese government has actively<br>misrepresented the case or mortality<br>figures they've been publishing<br>internationally<br>do you have an opinion on this um yes i<br>think i<br>covered that reasonably well from the<br>chinese science i presented<br>look i think that anybody who understood<br>data reasonably well from an<br>epidemiological point of view could tell<br>that they were not able to diagnose a<br>huge number of cases early on<br>and that the data were clear on that and<br>there wasn't a clear attempt to<br>show that they had a lot more cases by<br>the<br>different case definition that they<br>tried in february<br>so i don't think that china has been<br>misleading anybody<br>any more than anybody else's with<br>respect to the presentation of their<br>data<br>thank you we have one more question feel<br>free to ignore this if it's going to be<br>covered later in the course or if it's<br>too political<br>but has any research being done on<br>deliberate under reporting or<br>misreporting of covered cases<br>i think again it's really important to<br>realize that uh<br>when showing surveillance statistics you<br>have to have a<br>consistent case definition um i think<br>that that so the case definition has to<br>be the the evidence of a positive test<br>what i think i've hopefully shown here<br>in this talk is that<br>the criteria for testing change over<br>time<br>and all sorts of other factors come into<br>play which<br>lead to having to be very careful how<br>you interpret the case<br>the statistics from any one country i<br>don't think any country has been<br>deliberately<br>trying to hide the number of cases that<br>they've got<br>you if there are no more questions just<br>remember you can put your questions<br>through the q a<br>and function at the bottom of your<br>screen if there no more questions for<br>phillip we will move on to our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
