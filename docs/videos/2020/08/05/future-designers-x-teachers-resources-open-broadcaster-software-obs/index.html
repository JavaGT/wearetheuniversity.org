accurate.</p><p>Kirra we're here with byron mallet who's<br>a lecturer and animation and visual<br>effects at Victoria University<br>hello nice to have you here so what is<br>OBS OBS stands for open broadcaster<br>software and it is a very useful tool<br>for creating videos that can be streamed<br>live so live streaming allows you to<br>basically manipulate and control video<br>and other media and other types of<br>interesting sources not not only for<br>live-streaming but also for creating<br>video content for teaching for<br>distribution where students can consume<br>at their own leisure and it allows you<br>to sort of really take control over the<br>kind of content that you deliver in the<br>same way that you may have done in the<br>past where things like power point or<br>other sources but you get to blend live<br>video into the mix as well which gives<br>you a presence in your content and why<br>do you like using it for teaching I use<br>I like using it for teaching a lot<br>mainly because it helps to streamline<br>the process of creating my online videos<br>mainly because that is time consuming<br>you know sort of preparing a video<br>creating a lot of sort of content and<br>then delivering it trying to optimize<br>that process as much as possible so that<br>you spend more time sort of giving the<br>content of the students rather<br>necessarily preparing the content I<br>found is very useful so I make sure you<br>can do some very interesting things I'm<br>gonna go ahead for example and just show<br>you for example if I go to this little<br>scene here I can pop up my name with as<br>like a nice little animated video so you<br>can spend a little bit of time ahead of<br>preparing sort of delivering lectures or<br>classes to sort of add some of these<br>little sort of snazzy things into your<br>preparation and just quickly to show you<br>here what OBS itself actually looks like<br>so ever you knows here I'm so still<br>sitting here on the side but you<br>essentially have a workspace that is<br>divided into scenes where each scene<br>down here for example is kind of like a<br>different shot maybe like it could be a<br>different topic you could think of them<br>in the way of say like PowerPoint slides<br>but you could then say maybe go to a<br>scene like here I click on face you can<br>see it's just me my webcam up on the<br>screen and I go back there to face plus<br>name you see I can actually have a<br>little title that I can sort of pull up<br>there so it's pretty much you're in<br>control of your own TV station is really<br>the best way to describe it excellent<br>and why do you think it's good from a<br>student perspective from a student<br>perspective I think it's most valuable<br>because you get to associate a face with<br>the content if you have content you're<br>presenting the students where you're<br>just showing a window just information<br>and they hear a voice over the top they<br>sort of lose a bit of a personal<br>connection to the person who's<br>delivering the content itself plus you<br>also lose a lot of elements such as<br>mouth movements body language emotion<br>things that are have really helped<br>students to sort of become engaged with<br>content so I'm just going to move over<br>here to this piece of software so this<br>is 3d coat and this is some 3d software<br>I've been teaching this trimester to my<br>course and as you can see I've moved to<br>the scene I can take my little video and<br>move it down to a corner where I'm out<br>of the way and I can still show students<br>what's going on in the scene I can go<br>here and sort of take control and add<br>some extra sort of content but they get<br>to see all of my reactions and<br>everything that's going on with my<br>little video down the corner at the same<br>time that really I think helps<br>engagement OB this is pretty flexible as<br>well like if you find you want to<br>actually do a little bit of sort of live<br>editing I can maybe pop my video over<br>here so now I'm in a corner where maybe<br>I'm out of the way of the content I'm<br>actually working on so yeah it's very<br>useful and the software has been used a<br>lot actually for live streaming for<br>things like video games and that's<br>actually where a lot of the development<br>the software actually came from so it's<br>free it's open source there is a very<br>large number of plugins that you can get<br>for the software even months for example<br>to take the output of something like OBS<br>and put it into software like zoom for<br>live streaming so you can get control of<br>all of this<br>of real-time content of real-time<br>manipulation in your broadcasts that<br>students tune into not just in videos<br>that you record on your own computer and<br>give them for consumption at a later<br>date so it really gives you a lot of<br>control fantastic thank you very much we<br>have some lengths for you guys if you<br>want to have a look at OBS and some of<br>the plugins for letting it Lincoln to<br>zoom and other streaming stream<br>streaming software so if you're</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
