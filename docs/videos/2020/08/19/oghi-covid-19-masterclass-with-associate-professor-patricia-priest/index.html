medicine at the university of<br>otago<br>her research interests include<br>infectious disease epidemiology<br>and prevention and control screening<br>and public health and epidemiology she<br>will discuss<br>what is new zealand's strategy for<br>surveillance of covered 19 going forward<br>okay cool right kirakoto<br>um thanks jackie and uh<br>this is the title of the talk that i was<br>asked to give in the series what is this<br>new zealand strategy for surveillance of<br>covert 19 going forward<br>and i just want to start with a brief<br>caveat<br>which is to say that i i feel slightly<br>ambivalent about being part of a<br>master class series<br>i am a public health medicine specialist<br>and an<br>infectious disease epidemiologist but<br>like many people involved in the<br>response to this pandemic<br>i'm not an expert on coronaviruses per<br>se<br>or indeed on responding to pandemics in<br>general<br>i've been trying to help out with the<br>expertise that i do have<br>and am a member of the ministry of<br>health's technical advisory group<br>it's been a really exciting<br>learning curve for me being involved in<br>but although surveillance is a key<br>epidemiological component of the<br>pandemic response obviously surveillance<br>per se<br>is not the focus of my research so i'm<br>not actually here to present either<br>research that i have done<br>or operational work that i have done<br>and i can't speak for the ministry which<br>is the body that<br>runs the surveillance so<br>i'm here to share with you what is being<br>done<br>based on what is publicly available<br>from the ministry so just wanted to be<br>clear about that at the beginning<br>so just to start i'm not going to start<br>by reiterating how we got here because<br>i'm sure you're all very clear about<br>all of that at the moment but just to<br>remind us what surveillance is it's<br>essentially<br>information for action and it has this<br>series of steps which of course are not<br>completely differentiated and happen<br>more or less all at once but it's a<br>process where<br>the aim is to get uh analyzed and<br>interpreted data to the people who<br>need to take action in a timely fashion<br>and we do surveillance not just in<br>pandemics<br>and not just for infectious diseases<br>even but we<br>do surveillance for lots of different<br>diseases all the time<br>and in new zealand we include notifiable<br>occupational diseases and we have a<br>cancer register and so on so<br>it's it's quite a broad thing<br>surveillance in general<br>and my introductory epidemiology<br>textbook says that these are the<br>purposes of<br>surveillance and you can see that all of<br>these<br>pertain to the pandemic response<br>it's probably not often in new zealand<br>we find ourselves doing surveillance to<br>support<br>disease elimination although<br>the measles measle surveillance<br>is one of those times but<br>as you know we've chosen to follow an<br>elimination strategy<br>border controls robust case detection<br>surveillance<br>contact tracing and kind of community<br>control measures and so the surveillance<br>in this list<br>is surveillance where you're looking for<br>cases and that's what i'm going to focus<br>on<br>today obviously one could carry out<br>surveillance as in<br>systematic data collection and analysis<br>around what's happening at the border<br>around contact tracing and i know you've<br>seen some<br>some of that earlier on in the series<br>and around where the people are doing<br>the things that we hope that they are in<br>terms of control measures in the<br>community<br>but i'm going to talk mainly about the<br>case surveillance<br>today so you've seen this graph several<br>times already if you've been watching<br>the series<br>and this comes from this ministry<br>webpage where they<br>tell us how many tests have been done on<br>a daily basis<br>and you can see that they've gone up and<br>down over time<br>and i've just added in these red lines<br>or possibly orange lines<br>which which tell you when<br>at least some of the changes in case<br>definition for testing happened<br>so it's really just to make the point<br>um that as president trump is very well<br>aware<br>is that you you find when you look and<br>um we have changed our strategy for<br>looking<br>over time to adapt to things like the<br>capacity to do testing and also the<br>particular concerns<br>at the time so initially our criteria<br>for testing were quite<br>narrow and focused very much on<br>people who had traveled or were linked<br>to knowing cases<br>then over time we spread the net more<br>widely because we were wanting to find<br>out if there was<br>transmission out there in the community<br>that we hadn't otherwise picked up<br>and then more recently we have gone back<br>to a slightly more<br>um focused approach<br>and so the ministry recently released a<br>document<br>which outlines the national testing<br>strategy for the next few months<br>well from last month and this month the<br>next month<br>which has these goals which you'll<br>recognize if you've ever looked at<br>our influenza pandemic<br>plan of continuing to keep the virus<br>out of our communities but also<br>to ensure that if it does get there that<br>we're able to<br>shut down those chains of transmission<br>and stamp it out so we've moved away<br>from<br>sort of large-scale asymptomatic testing<br>testing of people who don't have<br>symptoms<br>we're very much focusing on the border<br>because that's where our biggest risk is<br>at the moment<br>but wanting to ensure that if we<br>do have some infection in the community<br>we pick it up as early as we can<br>and so we're using this kind of<br>risk-based approach where we're<br>explicitly trying to think where are the<br>key areas of risk for infection<br>and one of the important things there is<br>actually limiting the impact<br>of our testing and all that goes with<br>that<br>on people's access to health care for<br>other conditions so there's a lot of<br>concern quite rightly<br>about the delayed care and people<br>delaying<br>seeking care for other conditions during<br>the alert level four and so on and<br>we need to be doing testing in a way<br>that doesn't<br>overwhelm our lab facilities and our<br>clinical<br>facilities so we want to get those the<br>best bang for our buck without<br>preventing people getting the care they<br>need for other things<br>the strategy document which is at this<br>link here<br>has this table which explains what it's<br>trying to do<br>and as you i'm going to talk a bit about<br>these four<br>parts of the supporting activities<br>just to note that these there's these<br>objectives which<br>are um so we want to find cases<br>as soon as we can because we really want<br>to stop any change of transmission<br>getting going<br>we need to keep a weather eye on whether<br>there might be<br>clusters or chains out there that we've<br>missed<br>this high level crisis management this<br>is kind of about the environment<br>and context in which the testing<br>strategy operates which is making sure<br>that we're keeping an eye more broadly<br>internationally and<br>on the research data so that if we learn<br>something new<br>that would change our strategy we<br>we do that um<br>and underpinning everything ought to be<br>the need for equitable access to testing<br>and in order to<br>provide equity in the um<br>outcomes as well um so we're not we're<br>actually<br>our testing strategy is mainly about um<br>it's mainly clinical so picking people<br>up who might need to be treated and<br>about control<br>um trying to find change of transmission<br>and shut them down rather than<br>sort of surveillance in its broader<br>sense because at the moment we believe<br>that we don't have disease in the<br>community to be<br>surveilling as it were so just running<br>through those four parts<br>um the first part about testing people<br>with symptoms<br>so i said we're being a bit more focused<br>and we've continued to have<br>the same symptom definitions we've had<br>for some time<br>but we've linked it to or it's been<br>linked<br>to this higher index of suspicion<br>so this is not the testing at the border<br>this is<br>testing people who come who have have<br>symptoms<br>and of all the people who might have<br>symptoms it's trying to say<br>who are the most at risk of having been<br>infected with covert<br>and so people who've been in contact<br>with a case people who've traveled or<br>been in contact with a traveller<br>and people who've worked internationally<br>on vessels of various kinds<br>and these people to be tested and should<br>self-isolate while they wait for the<br>results because they are the people we<br>think<br>if anyone has it it might be in that<br>group we still don't think they're at<br>very high risk but<br>it's some being cautious and those tests<br>are notified to the medical officer of<br>health<br>the fact that people have met this<br>definition<br>and that enables the the testing to be<br>tracked so that<br>um the ministry can keep an eye on<br>whether the<br>this testing appears to be being uh<br>available equitably<br>whether there seem to be some groups or<br>areas that are missing out in which case<br>they can<br>put in place some processes to try and<br>address that<br>there is still testing of people with<br>symptoms who don't meet the higher index<br>of suspicion<br>and so those people this is kind of<br>edging into<br>keeping an eye out in the places where<br>we don't really think we'll find<br>covert but just giving ourselves the<br>chance of finding it maybe if it's out<br>there<br>so we don't really think those people<br>have covered but<br>we might they might not meet the higher<br>index of suspicion but the clinician<br>might<br>feel that it's worth testing them<br>because maybe there's some<br>slightly less don't quite meet those<br>criteria but they're concerned that they<br>might actually have it and so they<br>can they can be tested but they don't<br>need to be<br>self-isolated the testing data is still<br>reported and again<br>analyzed to ensure that there's testings<br>being<br>being equitably available and<br>the the document also notes that there<br>might need to be some more active<br>approaches to making testing available<br>to people who may have their experience<br>barriers to accessing primary care where<br>part two is about contact tracing and<br>this is the first couple of points there<br>just to point out that when when a case<br>arises we want to not only<br>try to find the people that they might<br>have infected which is what we tend to<br>think of as contact tracing<br>but we also want to try and find out who<br>infected them<br>because if we can do that that might<br>help us to<br>look in other places for other people<br>that person might have infected<br>so there's a focus on one hand on trying<br>to identify and shut down<br>chains of transmission but also to to<br>keep that sort of<br>looking out there for where there might<br>be chains that we've missed<br>and this thing about additional<br>risk-based testing<br>may be warranted in that sentence<br>that in should be saying in potentially<br>high-risk groups so the idea of this is<br>that<br>if in investigating a case in their<br>contacts<br>there seems to have possibly been a<br>transmission in say a particular<br>occupational group<br>or a particular workplace you might want<br>to go<br>and test people who don't actually have<br>a<br>history of contact with anyone you know<br>is infected and who don't have symptoms<br>but who might seem to possibly be at<br>risk because of that<br>that workplace or that occupational<br>group<br>and this idea of ripples of risk is is<br>to do with<br>if you think of the cases being uh the<br>pebble in the<br>in the pond you start by testing the<br>very close<br>contact people and depending on what you<br>find there you might go a bit further<br>out and potentially a bit further out<br>again<br>so we're trying to shut down chains of<br>transmission but also give ourselves a<br>chance of finding<br>undertake otherwise undetected cases and<br>chains<br>part three which is about monitoring<br>monitoring trends in diseases with<br>this this monitoring of symptoms<br>under normal circumstances can be<br>a useful way of getting a kind of early<br>warning of when<br>say the flu season is about to hit or if<br>there's something<br>unusual about this this season's flu<br>if you see so these graphs both have<br>this grey<br>line which is the historical data and<br>then<br>they've got this year's rate and and so<br>we always track um this is the health<br>line calls and ili<br>is influenza-like illness so that's a<br>cluster of symptoms about cough and<br>unfortunately they're not so great for<br>using for an early warning system for<br>covert 19<br>for us for two reasons one is because we<br>really want to find<br>cases as soon as they appear and by the<br>time you see a signal on this kind of<br>scale that would be a lot of cases<br>but also because you know<br>people calling healthline has got to do<br>with more than just the level of<br>symptoms so<br>there might not normally be many people<br>calling healthline in march and<br>april they might still have a few<br>symptoms but they know it's probably not<br>a cold and probably not flu and they<br>don't feel they need advice on it so<br>they don't call but<br>in our current context we had a lot of<br>people calling<br>then and we heard another peak recently<br>so<br>that's not going to tell us whether um<br>coverts getting going somewhere and and<br>this is a<br>sentinel surveillance from general<br>practices and and again there's<br>there's a lot goes into whether people<br>attend general practice during a<br>pandemic<br>that's different from normal however<br>keeping an eye on these things<br>and looking regionally might be useful<br>in identifying regions<br>where a closer look is warranted<br>and the other thing that this kind of<br>surveillance syndromic surveillance<br>can be used for when you're trying to<br>eliminate a disease<br>is to just make sure that the testing<br>system itself<br>is working well so if<br>if we want to make sure that people are<br>presenting for testing and therefore<br>we're likely to find the cases<br>we might look at about at how<br>how things are going compared with<br>normal because if people aren't sharing<br>the fact they've got symptoms because<br>for some reason they don't want to be<br>tested<br>then that would be a worry if we were<br>seeing<br>rates of people reporting symptoms that<br>were much lower than we'd expect<br>we'd be worried that maybe people aren't<br>coming forward for testing<br>and therefore we might miss cases<br>unfortunately again in this context it's<br>not<br>so helpful at the moment<br>and the reason is because we actually<br>have a lot less<br>symptoms going on we actually uh this is<br>the<br>the data from flu tracker which has a<br>huge panel of people who report each<br>week what symptoms they've had<br>and it it kind of shows the benefit of<br>um<br>of alert level four on things more than<br>just covered transmission<br>we've actually got a lot lower rates of<br>people with this is the fever and cough<br>data<br>than we would normally expect and this<br>is<br>this is almost certainly not because<br>people are reluctant to divulge that<br>because the flu tracking<br>doesn't have any implications you just<br>let them know what's happening on<br>so we can't really use the data on<br>what's happening syndromically to tell<br>us<br>really either whether we're seeing an<br>early peak or<br>whether the system is whether people are<br>coming forward for testing<br>appropriately but we keep an eye on it<br>because<br>as i said before some regional<br>breakdowns might be useful<br>and also you want to be keeping your eye<br>on everything<br>just in case it does provide something<br>that turns out to be really useful<br>part four of the national testing<br>strategy is about the border<br>and in terms of testing at the border<br>as we probably all know people coming<br>into the country<br>and who are in managed facilities are<br>tested now at day three<br>and day 12 and the reasons for those<br>that for that timing is to do with<br>trying to catch people who<br>at day three who<br>are infectious early either because they<br>have a relatively short incubation<br>period or they got infected a wee<br>while before they arrived and then day<br>12<br>again to try to pick up people who might<br>have a longer incubation period<br>the rules for crew are quite complex<br>and and change in fact at the time the<br>testing strategy was written<br>they weren't tested unless they were<br>symptomatic<br>and border workers are a focus for<br>testing and and encouraging them to have<br>a very low threshold for<br>testing if they have symptoms because<br>there are other surveillance strategies<br>one could argue that they're not<br>particularly useful right now<br>for surveillance in new zealand because<br>as i said<br>we don't believe that we have<br>new cases happening and these are ways<br>of getting a sense of<br>how many people in the population are<br>being infected<br>and have been infected so serology<br>i know that james usher talked about<br>this<br>there's some research projects going on<br>that are doing<br>serological testing but it's not being<br>used as a surveillance strategy at this<br>point<br>and wastewater testing if we were<br>concerned that<br>if we had if we had transmission in the<br>community and we were wanting to<br>get a general sense of whether the<br>prevalence is going up and down<br>in populations that can be useful but<br>again<br>probably not so useful right now and i<br>know that some of the regular health<br>surveys that get done<br>have been asking about things like<br>people's adherence to some of those<br>population<br>measures that are one of the pillars of<br>our elimination response<br>thank you trish we have a few questions<br>that are coming in<br>sure first of all can you please comment<br>on the reasons why<br>people leaving isolation can refuse to<br>be tested<br>i can't comment on the reasons for that<br>because that would be<br>a legal issue<br>i imagine um i don't know how many<br>people are in that situation<br>it's obviously a concern if people are<br>leaving isolation<br>without testing but i i actually don't<br>know any of the details of that so i'd<br>hesitate to say anything very definitive<br>fair enough um trish how does<br>surveillance for covert 19 differ from<br>surveillance for<br>other epidemics such as the seasonal flu<br>or<br>well in relation to seasonal flu so<br>surveillance<br>it's obviously the surveillance for the<br>cove that has as i said it's changed<br>change over time and will continue to do<br>so um<br>surveillance for the the usual flu<br>is um there's a couple of key reasons<br>for it one of<br>one of them is to is that sort of early<br>warning system and<br>keeping an eye on rates you know in case<br>we've got something we're<br>unexpected and and it starts shooting up<br>and we need to think<br>what's going on here and and respond in<br>some way<br>and another reason is because the<br>the one one component of the usual<br>surveillance<br>involves taking swabs of a sample of<br>people who come in with flu-like illness<br>and that helps us to know what strains<br>are circulating which in turn can give<br>us some information<br>about how severe we think the season's<br>likely to be<br>for planning but also can feeds into<br>the decision making about the vaccine<br>for the following year<br>so so those things um they're the sort<br>of<br>that that's the purpose of the of the<br>fluent flu surveillance<br>it for the covert it's been it's been<br>really around<br>um first of all figuring out how much of<br>it's coming into the country<br>and then figure then obviously trying to<br>track down people who've been infected<br>and<br>shutting down chains of transmission<br>then there was a period where we were<br>actively looking<br>for cases that might not be symptomatic<br>in case there was transmission we<br>weren't<br>expecting or hadn't seen and now as i<br>say we're moving more back to<br>trying to uh identify it when it happens<br>so that we can<br>shut down the change of transmission if<br>we go we may eventually go to something<br>like uh serological testing which would<br>which would look for those sort of<br>bigger picture patterns in the<br>population<br>thank you waiting for a few more<br>questions to come through<br>so while we do are there any additional<br>insights you may want to share from your<br>presentation that you didn't get a<br>chance to cover<br>sorry about that but um no i mean i<br>think um<br>i was really you know it's felt it's<br>it's it feels like a really long time<br>since the end of march it's actually not<br>that long<br>um but it's been very much an evolving<br>kind of situation<br>and there's you know there's been a lot<br>of trying to<br>uh you know there's been that we had<br>plans and so we<br>we didn't start from nothing but you<br>know this is a completely i<br>hate to use the word unprecedented it's<br>a bit overused but<br>you know we've been responding and<br>working out what we're going to do next<br>sort of all at the same time and i think<br>actually we've done a<br>pretty remarkable job of doing all those<br>things and<br>um and coming through as well as we have<br>at this point<br>that seemed like an awfully long time<br>ago doesn't it one last question for you<br>um is there anything that you<br>think is missing in new zealand<br>you know you can always come up with<br>something that would be<br>sort of more gold-plated<br>um and you know in some<br>other countries where there's actually<br>really high rates of<br>transmission going on right now there's<br>a whole lot of stuff that people are<br>proposing or doing<br>around you know regular swabbing like<br>there's a whole discussion going on<br>about<br>students coming back to college in the<br>states and whether they should just be<br>being swabbed every week<br>because you need to find the cases and<br>take them out of circulation quickly<br>and so all that sort of asymptomatic<br>screening<br>you know in that context it's probably a<br>really good idea but right now we<br>actually have<br>very low probability of people being<br>infected and<br>and so i i think that what we've got is<br>probably<br>is probably as good as we need for our<br>purposes<br>given that we don't have endless<br>clinical or<br>lab resources so doing that very very<br>detailed<br>kind of um precautionary swabbing<br>is i don't think it's justified at the<br>moment but you know if things change<br>then<br>that might change thank you very much<br>associate professor patricia priest</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
