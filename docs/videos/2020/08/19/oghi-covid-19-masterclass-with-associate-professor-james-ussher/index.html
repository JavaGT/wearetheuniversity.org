the introduction so uh<br>yesterday i'm going to<br>talk about diagnostics and i'd have to<br>say that's a hard act to follow<br>having to follow on from the director<br>general of health<br>but i'll do my best and please bear with<br>me<br>so i'd just like to start pre-covert<br>so this was uh uh my mid-january<br>uh in stuart island a beautiful uh<br>beautiful day there<br>not knowing what the storm that was to<br>follow<br>uh on my return to to work was going to<br>be<br>and came back to reports and um mid to<br>late january<br>of uh outbreak of a novel coronavirus<br>and in china<br>centered in the hubai province around in<br>in the city of wuhan<br>and reports of human human transmission<br>even though there were early only a<br>small number of cases at this point it<br>was of significant concern we had cases<br>reported in other countries including<br>south korea<br>and japan as well<br>so at this point i had a conversation<br>with<br>a colleague in the department of<br>microbiology professor miguel<br>quinono<br>for virology um in in the department<br>um and together we decided that it was<br>probably this was a significant concern<br>and that we should try and set up<br>an essay at the southern community<br>laboratories to diagnose this<br>in case we saw further transmission and<br>we needed to<br>have a diagnostic effort in in dunedin<br>so this was a real team effort and i'd<br>just like to give a massive<br>shout out to dr jenny grant who's the<br>head of the molecular pathology<br>laboratory at southern community<br>laboratories<br>who did much of the work and and got the<br>essay up and running<br>um and also to miguel's team uh dr<br>rodery harford and<br>dr blair lawley to postdocs working with<br>miguel<br>who helped with the establishment of the<br>essay<br>so the first genome of<br>sars cove ii was published in uh<br>back in 10th january and<br>researchers around the world several<br>groups around the world designed essays<br>on the basis of that sequence and<br>one of those was from the christian<br>drastics group at<br>charity in berlin germany<br>and that was the essay that we elected<br>to<br>set up so there were three different<br>targets that he described one against<br>the<br>rna-dependent rna polymerase one against<br>the eugene and one against the engine<br>we elected to set up essays against the<br>rdrp<br>and the and the e-gene<br>and we decided to put it on the fusion<br>um this is a large uh piece of equipment<br>it doesn't have a panther on it<br>despite the uh the nice graphics that<br>logic provide<br>but it is from to use it's uh<br>straightforward in that it's<br>uh essentially a black box um it's uh<br>you've put the sample in and it does<br>everything for you it does the rna<br>extraction and does the pcr<br>amplification<br>however there's a lot under the hood<br>that needs to be sorted out for it to be<br>able to do that and this was a<br>an open access essay that we had to<br>establish and some of the difficulties<br>that<br>we and others around the country so say<br>that other labs around the country were<br>moving at the same time to set up<br>essays including canterbury health labs<br>and lab plus<br>and the much of the challenge that we<br>faced was that we didn't actually have<br>any virus to use to set up these essays<br>we didn't have a positive control<br>and this was where working with miguel's<br>group at the university was<br>especially helpful so he<br>and his team designed plasmids that had<br>a<br>t7 rna polymerase promoter that was able<br>to be used to make<br>rna copies of those pcr products oh<br>sorry of those of the pcr targets<br>that we could then use to establish the<br>essay<br>we're also kindly provided by some cdna<br>copies from viral culture by the uh<br>vigil<br>reference laboratory from from melbourne<br>and<br>set these essays set the essay up using<br>these<br>reagents now this wasn't<br>straightforward not having virus and<br>trying to use<br>rna to validate<br>the extraction protocol as well<br>but we eventually managed to get it up<br>and running<br>on friday the 13th in march so<br>it took a good six weeks to to get the<br>essay up and running<br>and it was a bit of an inauspicious day<br>because we had had a couple of samples<br>prior to that that we'd been sending uh<br>to uh to canterbury health labs but uh<br>the first case that was diagnosed in<br>southern district health board was also<br>um on the friday 13th march so on our<br>first uh first day<br>of uh running and that was new zealand's<br>uh eighth case<br>um and was a tourist in in queenstown<br>so it was a moment of great relief and<br>really<br>just in time that we got this up and<br>running because after that we saw a<br>massive explosion and testing<br>so we went from uh just a handful of<br>tests that we were sending away<br>to rapidly having to test well over 100<br>tests a day<br>and that rapidly spiraled<br>over the ensuing weeks through lockdown<br>and then as we went from level four down<br>to level three and<br>making decisions around or helping<br>provide data to<br>the ministry to make decisions around<br>those changes and levels there was a lot<br>of asymptomatic uh screening that went<br>uh<br>went on as well so we picked it over 800<br>tests a day from having this having been<br>a test<br>that we had never run uh prior to<br>to january i'd again like to give a<br>massive<br>shout out to the laboratory staff so<br>particularly jenny<br>grant through this she was in there<br>virtually every day<br>far in excess of her normal working<br>hours ensuring that this was<br>running smoothly and the laboratory<br>staff and both microbiology<br>and in the molecular pathology<br>laboratories at southern community<br>laboratories who split into two<br>different shifts to<br>try and maintain bubbles and trying to<br>maintain testing uh through through<br>lockdown so they're real<br>unsung heroes uh in this<br>nationally across the country we saw a<br>similar story so<br>uh the rolling uh average<br>is um sorry the the<br>legend is uh it has been cropped but the<br>the rolling averages<br>seven day average is in yellow um and<br>then you can see the daily swings<br>in in red with uh even in lockdown<br>people seem to observe weekends<br>so we saw so during weekends but um<br>significant volumes uh through<br>throughout um and coming towards the end<br>of level four<br>um which are then dropped off but we in<br>week or so we've seen massive increases<br>and in fact the last two days have seen<br>the two largest<br>days for uh laboratories across the<br>country um<br>with over ten thousand tests done two<br>days ago and almost ten thousand tests<br>done<br>yesterday as well so a huge amount of<br>work done by all laboratories<br>across the country through that time<br>we've also built up our capacity<br>and uh dr bloomfield uh was often<br>being reported on the uh in the daily uh<br>reports uh from<br>from the ministry uh so<br>currently our capacity nationwide sits<br>at about 12 000 tests although<br>um this is uh with the return to<br>business as usual the laboratories are<br>now<br>um doing and we're actually seeing<br>increases in business as usual testing<br>uh this is uh uh we would be absolutely<br>stretching the laboratories to<br>to run this amount of uh these volumes<br>and in fact the volumes of the last two<br>days have<br>have been a real stretch in in some<br>areas of the country<br>so there's been a number of laboratories<br>across the country that have<br>have come on board and developed tests<br>locally<br>it hasn't been this only tells the<br>part of the story so the that's the<br>theoretical number of tests we could do<br>per day uh the the reality of how long<br>we could sustain that for<br>uh was uh quite different uh for<br>for much of lockdown uh covert 19 has<br>seen a<br>unprecedented disruption of global<br>manufacturing and supply<br>that has affected many areas and<br>particularly<br>diagnostic testing so globally we've<br>seen a huge demand<br>for reagents required<br>for for testing from swabs through to<br>pcr supplies<br>and many of those supply chains have<br>been disrupted for example<br>many of the swabs that we use for<br>testing come from northern italy<br>um and obviously italy was that northern<br>italy was right in the centre of the<br>early outbreak and very quickly uh<br>supply of swabs uh completely dried up<br>similarly with our supply of reagents to<br>to run on<br>these large platforms such as the as the<br>panther fusion and<br>different machines at other laboratories<br>um quickly became<br>extremely challenging and we can see<br>this graph here just plots supplies on<br>hand and orange<br>versus the the test testing rates that<br>we were doing<br>per day and uh by data along the bottom<br>um and you can see that uh there were a<br>couple of points where<br>we were saying sailing perilously close<br>uh to the wind so<br>often uh in dunedin we were running with<br>three to five days<br>worth of stock on hand uh desperately<br>waiting for<br>uh the next shipment which usually<br>arrived before we ran<br>out but on a couple of occasions uh we<br>had to<br>grin and bear it for a day or two and<br>just to sort of highlight some of the<br>challenges that were involved in this<br>around this time period where we we did<br>actually<br>run out of testing capability for a day<br>we had a shipment that had come from the<br>us and had arrived in melbourne and<br>none of these shipments were ever uh<br>what we ordered<br>in volume um they were many fold less<br>than what we required but the<br>distributors were trying to make sure<br>that um<br>there was fair distribution around the<br>globe um so they were on a sort of<br>global<br>supply um and so we didn't get what we<br>ordered we got what we were sent<br>and what we sent often didn't get here<br>in a timely fashion so around here we<br>had uh<br>samples supplies that had been sent from<br>the us and it arrived in<br>melbourne uh or sydney sorry and then<br>we're sitting on the tarmac in sydney<br>waiting to to get to new zealand<br>i took uh from wednesday to saturday to<br>to get them from sydney to uh to<br>auckland<br>uh with three flights cancelled um<br>and then uh the supplies didn't get<br>from auckland to dunedin until thursday<br>uh with multiple flights um canceled in<br>fact it proved in the end that was far<br>more reliable to ship supplies by road<br>than to try and send anything<br>by by ear so it was an extremely<br>challenging time and and the laboratory<br>staff worked through this extremely well<br>and to try and maintain our testing<br>capacity<br>through this time we established<br>and jenny and her team established<br>another three essays<br>in the laboratory on three different<br>platforms to try and diversify<br>our<br>dependence on different suppliers we<br>worked up<br>many polling in an afternoon on a friday<br>afternoon<br>uh when just because this was all<br>happening just before<br>the um or the the just at the same time<br>as all of the surveillance testing<br>and asymptomatic um people in uh various<br>areas of the<br>of of the country was occurring so<br>uh we worked up uh that she worked that<br>up in an afternoon so she's<br>been an absolute hero of the of the<br>response<br>okay so that hopefully gives you a a<br>feel for<br>uh some of the the challenges um<br>and uh that the diagnostic laboratories<br>have had to be have had to go through i<br>just want to<br>maybe comment on a few issues now around<br>uh around diagnostic testing both for<br>molecular testing and serology<br>uh testing and some of this has been in<br>the<br>in the media lots of questions around<br>sensitivity and testing and<br>sample type and i'm just trying to<br>address some of these<br>issues now so for a start sample type is<br>extremely important<br>so originally we weren't sure and we<br>were asking for both a nasopharyngeal<br>and an iron foundries sample and if<br>possible if the patient was producing<br>sputum we also wanted a sputum sample<br>there's emerging data now that<br>nasopharyngeal is probably more<br>sensitive<br>than an oropharyngeal sample so<br>in in this study here there was a<br>significant number of patients<br>who were positive on the nasopharyngeal<br>nasopharyngeal sample<br>who were negative on an oropharyngeal<br>sample that was collected<br>at the same time so no doubt that uh<br>although unpleasant<br>a nasopharyngeal sample is superior to<br>an oropharyngeal<br>sample although if you combine an rfr<br>and gel sample with a nasal swab even if<br>it's not a nasopharyngeal swab<br>um it it may be provide you with<br>if not quite as good sensitivity or<br>almost as good<br>it's a bit hard to to read this table<br>but hard to<br>to summarize otherwise but showing uh<br>by a different sample type but also by<br>data collection because data collection<br>is also extremely important<br>the positivity rate in in patients um<br>and so we've got throat nasal swabs and<br>then lower respiratory tract samples so<br>sputum and a broncho alveolar lavage<br>fluid<br>so just showing that again the nasal<br>swabs more sensitive than a throat swab<br>but that a sputum sample is uh is more<br>sensitive again<br>than um than a upper respiratory tract<br>sample they've just got the ct values<br>here so in pcr<br>a higher ct value is actually reflective<br>of less virus<br>whereas uh so the earlier you detect a<br>sample the more<br>more there is so sputum has got more<br>virus in it than<br>a nasal swab or a throat swab<br>and you note that if we look at here at<br>the the nasopharyngeal trait swabs and<br>the first week of illness they're<br>more sensitive sensitivity starts to<br>drop<br>off during the uh the second week of<br>illness and by the third week of illness<br>it's<br>really dropping down so<br>timing is important the site is swabbing<br>is important<br>um and ideally a lower respiratory tract<br>sample<br>is important so here's some other data<br>from<br>a uh the start of the german group from<br>the drosten group so here we're just<br>plotting<br>uh the amount of rna viral rna<br>in a log scale versus<br>the days post symptom onset and at the<br>top we've got throat swabs and<br>nasopharyngeal swabs<br>it's a bit hard to make out the<br>nasopharyngeal versus the throats but<br>generally the nasopharyngeal<br>have got more virus in them for longer<br>than the throat swabs um but they're<br>generally there is more in sputum<br>uh than there are than there is a throat<br>or noseparen gel swabs<br>um and it persists for longer as well uh<br>still is not a sample that we<br>that we generally look at but you can<br>see shedding of<br>uh of virus and stool as well<br>interestingly um self-collected swabs<br>might be an acceptable<br>alternative and this is just some<br>a recent publication from the new<br>england journal of medicine<br>and interestingly the in brisbane this<br>is an approach that's been<br>taken uh throughout uh but in this study<br>they compared<br>the use of a nasopharyngeal swab that<br>was collected by a healthcare worker as<br>their<br>uh their reference standard versus the<br>sensitivity of the self-self<br>or various self-collected swabs um so<br>the self-collected swabs are slightly<br>less sensitive so<br>a tongue swab is definitely less<br>sensitive than a<br>healthcare worker collective<br>nasopharyngeal swab<br>but a nasal swab or a midterm swab<br>collected self-collect is almost just<br>not that much worse than a than a<br>nasopharyngeal swab and if we look at<br>the ct values so<br>again down here is more virus up here is<br>less<br>uh virus but generally there are fairly<br>comparable levels<br>between those samples so it might be<br>that<br>self-collected swabs might be an<br>acceptable alternative and might be less<br>unpleasant<br>than having to go to a sea back and have<br>a swab<br>pass straight back down your nose and it<br>feels like it's going to penetrate your<br>so just to highlight again the effect of<br>uh timing<br>on that sample and sampling on<br>sensitivity<br>so this is a meta-analysis of data that<br>was published in the<br>annals of internal medicine and this is<br>looking at days since exposure so this<br>is generally the day of symptom onset<br>shown by this this line so this is<br>pulling data from a number of<br>different papers so different swabbing<br>techniques<br>as well but generally we can see that<br>those first few days<br>after symptom onset are the days that<br>are the most<br>sensitive for testing and if if you<br>start testing people later in<br>presentation then<br>it's going to be you're less likely to<br>be able to detect the virus<br>with a with a single swap by pcr<br>and that you can detect virus in a<br>proportion of people<br>another important thing that we've noted<br>is that<br>pcr can remain positive however in a<br>proportion of people<br>for quite a long prepared period of time<br>so there's some data out in new york<br>looking at serial uh people who are<br>serially tested<br>and in this large data set of over 800<br>people<br>it took it took almost took four weeks<br>for 50<br>of people to become uh pcr negative<br>and this was uh important from a public<br>health perspective<br>um with clearing patients we had a<br>number of patients who were positive who<br>remained<br>positive by pcr for<br>for a number of number of weeks<br>and had ongoing symptoms and had to<br>remain<br>technically classified as not having<br>resolved and had to remain in isolation<br>uh because they remained pcr positive<br>and in fact<br>um this you can detect a in a proportion<br>of people you can detect pcr positivity<br>over<br>uh for over 40 days so remaining pcr<br>positive is perhaps not the best marker<br>of infectivity and<br>while there's not a lot of studies on<br>this there's emerging data that suggests<br>that if you look at culture<br>and the reason there's not a lot of data<br>on this is because uh you need a pc3<br>facility<br>uh to culture virus and there's not a<br>lot of those um<br>around the world and it's not part of<br>routine diagnostics<br>but if you look at culture even though<br>you can detect virus<br>out for out to over a month<br>you can really culture it after about<br>eight to ten days so<br>you can still detect the viral genome by<br>pcr but you can't actually the virus may<br>no longer<br>there's been a lot of talk about<br>asymptomatic cases and uh whether how<br>infectious uh they might be<br>so if you look at the amount of virus<br>present<br>by pcr by rt pcr<br>this is a recent paper from nature<br>medicine uh there's actually<br>these are people who are truly<br>asymptomatic who these so these are not<br>pre-symptomatic people so uh it's<br>important to distinguish between people<br>who are pcr positive who then go on to<br>develop<br>symptoms who seem to be more important<br>in transmission<br>than people who truly remain<br>asymptomatic<br>but if you look at the you can't<br>distinguish the asymptomatic from the<br>symptomatic people by um pcr so<br>similar amounts of similar viral loads<br>uh as measured by the ct value um this<br>is against two different targets and<br>those are symptomatic and<br>pink and those are asymptomatic and blue<br>um<br>and you also get prolonged shedding and<br>the asymptomatic cases and in fact in<br>this<br>cohort they suggested it was even<br>slightly longer in the asymptomatic<br>cases so<br>biologically asymptomatic cases and<br>symptomatic cases appear<br>very similar in the amounts of virus and<br>another important development is<br>being around or do rapid diagnostics<br>so there's a desire to rapidly be able<br>to detect<br>infections so that the essay that we<br>have set up in dunedin<br>uh is ameniable to rapid diagnostics and<br>that it is<br>a random access machine so samples can<br>be loaded as they<br>as they come in um and you can get a<br>result in a<br>three and a half hours so that was<br>extremely useful for management of<br>hospitalized patients<br>uh however uh in other parts of the the<br>district health board<br>where there were issues around uh<br>transport first<br>often we were looking up to 24 hours for<br>a result<br>and using more traditional molecular<br>methods<br>is used in many laboratories around the<br>country that are not random access<br>uh the testing um was often<br>in in batches and often uh turnaround<br>time was approaching 24 hours<br>so if you've got a patient who's sitting<br>in the emergency department who you need<br>to<br>manage you decide whether they uh<br>got covered 19 or not uh you might want<br>a rapid uh<br>test and some platforms have become<br>available uh that<br>can be used for rapid molecular testing<br>so one of these is kefir's gene expert<br>and uh this is a machine that's already<br>available in<br>multiple laboratories around new zealand<br>and this is<br>uh can give a result within 60 minutes<br>although it's low throughput and you can<br>usually only run a handful of samples at<br>one time<br>but this has been shown to be highly<br>sensitive<br>and specific for detection of<br>ii but the platform is important so<br>there has been some talk around<br>the bds id now which is a<br>slightly different pci is a different<br>method to amplify dna<br>and can provide a result in as early as<br>uh 10 minutes<br>however and this has been widely uh<br>utilized overseas including i believe<br>it's being used in the in the white<br>house we haven't really<br>seen these used in new zealand because<br>it's been very hard to ship these out of<br>uh out of new zealand um<br>so i've shipped these out of the out of<br>the us they haven't been able to supply<br>kits um but uh the recent<br>emerging publications suggesting that<br>this platform is not as sensitive<br>as some other platforms so that the<br>platform might be important<br>and we've now implemented these uh<br>trying to improve turnaround times<br>uh in some of our rural hospitals so<br>we've now placed gene experts with these<br>cartridges<br>in queenstown clyde and cargill there<br>are other smaller hospitals around the<br>in large hospitals around new zealand to<br>try and improve um<br>turnaround times although there is a<br>limitation on their ability to access<br>cartridges for these because again these<br>cartridges are made in the in the united<br>states<br>and we're on a restricted global supply<br>again<br>uh some of the issue other issues uh<br>that we have struck<br>is one of the major issues has been<br>around accessing<br>reagents to extract the nucleic acids<br>the the genome<br>of the of the virus from samples for<br>uh amplification um and that<br>the in big laboratories we're often<br>doing this on large<br>um uh robots for high throughput and<br>these require their own consumables<br>uh and that that has been one of the<br>reagents that's often been critical<br>and in supply for various laboratories<br>around the country so there is some<br>emerging data that<br>uh you can do uh pcr without extraction<br>for detecting sars uh cov2 and overall<br>the sensitivity<br>um is about 92 if you do it without<br>extraction so here's the gold standard<br>in blue<br>at the bottom uh so this is looking at<br>the ct value so here's the limit of<br>detection<br>40 cycles so if you're moving up it's<br>less sensitive<br>so there's certainly it uh is um about<br>uh up to on average maybe about five<br>cycles or more or less sensitive<br>if you do it without extraction um but<br>overall<br>most people have large amounts of virus<br>uh so the overall clinical sensitivity<br>is uh still reasonable but we're<br>certainly losing some analytical<br>sensitivity<br>uh by using an extraction free method<br>but that may be an option<br>um if we really can't<br>another rate limiting step has been<br>uh a great concern has been access to<br>swabs<br>and this has been globally there's been<br>concern around<br>accessing uh accessing swabs uh both<br>with swabs coming out of<br>uh italy uh where there has been<br>a major plan a major<br>outbreak and the factories have closed<br>down and we haven't been able to get<br>them there's been massive global<br>demand uh particularly we saw wuhan<br>swabbing the entire city population<br>recently<br>uh requiring uh over 10 million swabs so<br>this could be a<br>an issue going an ongoing issue going<br>forward and there is some data that<br>suggests that<br>um saliva might be an alternative<br>specimen type<br>so collecting half a ml of um saliva<br>they did this on 103 patients<br>who were positive by pcr and a<br>nasopharyngeal or throat swab<br>and they found that um overall uh saliva<br>was a pretty good um<br>sample type so again about 92<br>sensitive especially if you looked early<br>if you look later<br>after admission uh then it's not such a<br>good sample type but that<br>is the same as with the nasopharyngeal<br>swab there's also been some discussion<br>around um<br>not using molecular methods but using<br>rapid antigen tests so using uh<br>antibody to detect uh the virus<br>however these have generally looked<br>pretty poor in this sensitivity<br>so on the these saliva specimens while<br>pcr was 91.8<br>sensitive the rapid engine tests were<br>were pretty<br>uh pretty rubbish really and if you can<br>look at that overall<br>um so the uh all of these samples here<br>that had higher ct values<br>tested negative by the rapid antigen<br>tests um and only those that had the<br>highest amounts of virus on them<br>were positive by a rapid antigen test so<br>i think if<br>these rapid engine tests are going to<br>have any use there's going to need to be<br>a significant amount of work done on<br>them<br>finally i just wanted to say a little<br>bit about serology so<br>serology is detecting an immune response<br>to the virus<br>so detecting antibodies<br>and there's been interest in this and<br>there's been lots of talk in the media<br>about using rapid antigen<br>a rapid antibody test to detect people<br>who<br>might be infected however these really<br>play a very limited role<br>so they've got a very low sensitivity in<br>the first week of infection<br>so um only about 30 percent<br>unlike many infections igm which usually<br>comes up first<br>seems to be unhelpful igg seems to be<br>more important it also<br>seems to depend upon which antigen you<br>look for so the nuclear protein<br>is more comes up early immune responses<br>to the nuclear protein<br>uh then to the spike so here's the<br>receptor binding domain and spike so you<br>can see the curves have shifted<br>in time um to coming up later so<br>probably at least more role in a sero<br>prevalence<br>uh than they do in clinical diagnostics<br>there are a couple of good platforms<br>coming on the market now so<br>abbott and roche uh so here's the avid<br>assay so the avid assay<br>again we can see that in the first three<br>days of illness uh absolutely<br>absolutely rubbish sensitivity in the<br>first week we might pick up after 30<br>then by the uh by the second and third<br>week of illness we start to see the<br>sensitivity of these<br>uh climb and they do have a very high<br>specificity<br>but if you consider a country such as<br>new zealand where we've had very<br>very low incidence of infection uh then<br>still we're going to have issues with<br>false positives on these um on these uh<br>essays so we're running a study at the<br>moment<br>uh using an antibody test to uh using<br>the avid antibody test<br>to see if there has been further<br>transmission in the southern region<br>uh looking at high highly exposed<br>context<br>of of of cases and looking at probable<br>cases<br>and this is being led by dr arlo upton<br>from southern community labs and<br>uh susan jack the doctor susan jack<br>medical officer health and southern<br>district health<br>public health south and a number of<br>other people involved including allison<br>craigie<br>matt parry nicki moreland gary mccall<br>for myself<br>and the studies underway at the moment<br>so that<br>will be interesting to see just one note<br>of caution finally<br>we do see some recent data coming out<br>suggests that<br>antibody levels may decline during<br>convalescence<br>but i would note that neutralizing<br>antibodies remain<br>uh detectable which even if they do fall<br>back slightly so<br>this might be an issue for diagnostic<br>studies um but it does seem that<br>neutralizing antibodies remain<br>detectable even in<br>asymptomatic cases so i'll finish with<br>that<br>and uh if anyone's got any questions<br>thank you james would you like to<br>would you like to speak up next we have<br>about two minutes or so for questions<br>and<br>firstly how does the method of testing<br>oral swab versus<br>nasal swab for size cop2 compared to<br>other coronaviruses<br>sure so um other coronaviruses aren't<br>viruses that we are usually of great<br>diagnostic interest<br>so thinking of the human endemic<br>coronaviruses so there's four<br>human endemic coronaviruses um and they<br>generally cause the common co<br>about 10 to 30 of common colds they are<br>on some<br>multiplex panels so usually the viruses<br>that we're interested in from a<br>diagnostic perspective are influenza<br>and rsv generally we find<br>that nasopharyngeal swab is a more<br>sensitive<br>specimen type then and<br>then a throat swab for most uh viral<br>infections but<br>i'm not aware of any studies or there<br>may be out there but i haven't seen any<br>studies that uh specifically<br>have looked at coronaviruses they're not<br>as i say not usually a massive<br>clinical interest okay<br>um media have media have reported<br>non-testing for population groups<br>including children given your slide<br>about self-testing<br>would a simple nasal swab for children<br>be better than no testing at all<br>understanding that patients may be<br>reluctant to give informed consent for<br>children<br>to undergo a nasopharyngeal swamp yeah<br>that's a that's a great point um so<br>we certainly had issues with uh several<br>of the probable cases<br>uh related to children because after the<br>parents had had<br>um a nasopharyngeal swab they declined<br>for their children to<br>undergo the the same procedure so uh i<br>certainly<br>think that uh a with no doubt that<br>another a nasal swab or a<br>uh throat swab would be better than no<br>uh be better than nose vibe and while we<br>it<br>is maybe not the most sensitive i think<br>it would be a very good<br>option and i think going forward it's<br>something that you should be<br>considering especially for surveillance<br>testing where the pre-test probability<br>is a lot lower<br>and are we likely to have very high<br>throughput testing available at some<br>point<br>uh i'm assuming that's for serology um<br>so we<br>we do have high throughput molecular<br>testing high throughput serology testing<br>um so<br>certainly both the abbot and the roche<br>essays are<br>could be established in diagnostic<br>laboratories the question is whether<br>there is<br>a what the diagnostic need will be<br>the serology testing what its places and<br>clinical management<br>outside of studies so uh<br>it may be that at some point uh at the<br>border it might be something that's of<br>some utility um but yes no i mean<br>there's certainly our essays that are<br>available on high throughput platforms<br>and whether they are available in new<br>zealand will depend on what their role<br>might be and kind of management<br>thank you we're out of time but we've<br>only got one more question so we'll just<br>go with this one quickly<br>who is being tested in the southern<br>antibodies study<br>right so we're looking primarily<br>at household so the close contacts of<br>confirmed cases we are looking at health<br>care workers<br>um and we're interested in as well and<br>particularly people in queenstown<br>tourism workers<br>people who may have been tested<br>by pcr and have tested negative<br>during lockdown so those are the primary<br>groups uh that<br>that we're interested in so it's it's<br>not a true sero-prevalence study because<br>we're not taking a representative<br>sample of of the population but we're<br>looking to see if there's<br>better an idea of how much additional<br>transmission<br>there has been in those high-risk groups<br>thank you so that's all for today thank<br>you to associate professor james usher<br>thank you to marissa and to dr ashley<br>bloomfield as well for their<br>presentations<br>and thank you to you for attending we<br>will be back in the master class on<br>monday 29th of june<br>starting from 12 noon new zealand time</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
