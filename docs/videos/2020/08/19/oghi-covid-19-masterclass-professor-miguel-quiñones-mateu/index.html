run<br>for an hour<br>we'll finish it around 1pm new zealand<br>time our webinars are being recorded and<br>will be available on the augie website<br>later<br>we're also live streaming through the<br>augie facebook page<br>during the webinars each speaker will do<br>their presentation and you can ask<br>questions at any time through the q a<br>function at the bottom of your screen<br>i will then read the questions allowed<br>for the speaker to respond<br>if we're not able to get through all the<br>questions during this session we'll ask<br>the speakers to provide written<br>responses<br>which we'll post on the auggie website<br>as well our first speaker today<br>professor miguel quinones-mateo holds<br>the webster family chair in viral<br>pathogenesis<br>in the department of microbiology and<br>immunology at the university of otago<br>his talk will reveal what has been going<br>thank you jackie and thank you for the<br>invitation and thank you to the otago<br>global health institute for<br>you know inviting me to talk about what<br>we have been doing in the<br>in our lab i'm going to tell you a<br>little bit about the<br>history of why we started working with<br>these virus<br>you may know that every single biologist<br>in the world<br>became a coronavis around february or<br>march<br>so a lot of people have been asking me<br>what we have been doing for the last few<br>months<br>i'm going to give you a little bit of of<br>a you know history here<br>so before we start talking about what we<br>doing in the lab i'm going to give you<br>an update<br>and i'm sure that other people have done<br>this but i'm going to start with this<br>slide<br>we have more than 10 million people<br>already in<br>you know infected i will multiply that<br>by 10<br>and assuming that there is a lot of<br>people that have not been tested maybe<br>you know more than that and<br>unfortunately we have more than half a<br>million people have died<br>because of these vitals around the globe<br>um as you know in here in new zealand uh<br>we're doing you know relatively really<br>actually really well<br>we have managed to know i'm not sure if<br>this is gonna work yeah it works<br>um we managed to flatten the core and we<br>don't have that many more cases a few<br>important ones and lately<br>but i mean a relatively small number<br>compared with other countries like for<br>example the u.s where we have<br>more than 2.5 million people infected<br>and close to 130 000 people<br>who have died so far so when you see<br>that<br>um base you know you know the government<br>um response and then the amazing job<br>that everybody has been doing<br>we're doing relatively well like i said<br>before<br>so how this started and i labeled this<br>at the beginning<br>um believe it or not i was in fiji on<br>vacation with my family i mean my<br>daughter and my wife and i started<br>reading the news about<br>what was going on in china with these<br>new vitals<br>and i remember telling them that okay<br>that didn't look good i mean this<br>sounded more like an uninfluenced<br>pandemic again or<br>or maybe even a coronavis like the sars<br>in 2003.<br>so i came back to new zealand and james<br>who's uh<br>you're going to be hearing about um you<br>know vaccines later that he's going to<br>be speaking but james came to my<br>uh lab my to my office in mid-january<br>and he said he asked me if i you know i<br>was aware of what's going on in china<br>and he suggested that we should be ready<br>that we should be putting together<br>trying to implement and eventually<br>validate a quantitative rt pcr<br>test to diagnose copy 19 at least here<br>in<br>indonesia so i said why not i mean uh to<br>be honest i hesitated a little bit i had<br>a<br>bunch of different projects going on in<br>lab but i thought that this was really<br>exciting and<br>one of the main reasons that it<br>continues even to work with emergent<br>vitals and so<br>i said why not let's let's start work on<br>that so the first thing that we did<br>and i'm not going to try to go this<br>really quick because i know that james<br>talked about it uh<br>last week and in this in this master<br>class<br>so but i'm going to give you a little<br>bit more of details and technical<br>details<br>so the first thing that we did was uh we<br>didn't want to reinvent the wheel we<br>just wanted to see what other people<br>were doing out there<br>and this is a relatively simple uh essay<br>so we<br>found a group in in germany that had<br>published what it seems to be a really a<br>specific and sensitive test<br>to er to diagnose sars chronovitus 2<br>infections<br>so we ordered the primers and the<br>problem that we had at the time is that<br>we didn't have positive control of<br>course we didn't have any cases here in<br>new zealand at that point<br>not even in australia i think so we had<br>to order plasmid and synthetic genes<br>to have it as a control to validate or<br>to test our asset to validate it<br>eventually<br>so this is around the end of the last<br>week of january that we did these we are<br>the primers and everything<br>and we started the implementation and<br>verification of the assay in my lab in<br>the department of microbiology<br>immunology<br>and this is what uh this was work um<br>done by blair lawley in my<br>in my lab just simple you know a slide<br>just to show you because this is<br>summarizes a lot of work that blair<br>did in my lab um the asset was you know<br>really<br>nice limit of detection sensitivity we<br>were able to detect<br>all the way down to you know 50 to 100<br>copies<br>per reaction or per ml and<br>then at that point we were ready to<br>transfer it to james team<br>and jenny jenny dr jenny grant in the<br>the leading hospital<br>was able then to take the ass and<br>implement implemented in the panther<br>holologic<br>instrument that blair and james<br>described<br>last last week test sensitivity<br>specificity was working really really<br>well<br>with stressed reproducibility in both<br>labs and<br>both in the hospital and of course the<br>asset was really reproducible and<br>we were getting pretty much the same<br>data both in the panzer fusion and the<br>hospital in<br>my lab in the department of microbiology<br>so at that point we were ready to<br>transfer it to<br>i mean to go live like james mentioned<br>in last week<br>and then on march 13 um<br>they there james team was able to<br>identify the first case<br>in the meeting which if i remember<br>correctly was the eighth case<br>in new zealand okay uh they continued<br>working<br>they did some validation sending samples<br>to other clinical labs and everything<br>was working really well<br>100 concordance so we were really<br>excited about that<br>and continue working and they they<br>continue working uh<br>testing samples this is a snapshot of<br>the<br>as of 10 of april and 10th of april is<br>because of<br>the work that we continue to do and i'll<br>say you know you'll see it in a second<br>but at that point we have roughly 1 000<br>cases of carbon 19 and you see<br>roughly 200 cases in the southern<br>districts here<br>in in and tested here in dunedin<br>okay this slide is just to show you the<br>demographics of the clinical<br>demographics of the patient that were<br>tested at the time<br>um a little more than 4 600<br>samples tested roughly 60 of them were<br>female<br>and 109 that were positive as<br>of the 10th of april like i said and<br>then roughly 50 50<br>female male at that point uh this is the<br>distribution by age of the<br>number of you know people tested and<br>positive<br>and i don't pay too much attention to<br>these we need to investigate a little<br>bit this more but<br>this could be just resemble the<br>demographics of the deed and or<br>at least of the southern with plenty of<br>young people students and<br>you know a little bit older people like<br>me and<br>in around around the city<br>so one of the beauties of that james<br>mentioned yesterday i mean last week<br>about the panzer fusion is that is able<br>to do everything from our next traction<br>and you know<br>to not only diagnose sarcoma vitals to<br>infections but other respiratory<br>infections<br>so this slide at that point uh his team<br>was able to test<br>up to 375 patients at the time of<br>samples at the time the good news at<br>that point was that<br>none of the ones that were cases that<br>were positive for for coffee 19 were<br>positive for any other vitals or<br>respiratory vitals as tested by the<br>panther like<br>fusion the ones that were negative so i<br>mean 54 patients that were negative for<br>sarcolonovitas too<br>some of them were positive for other<br>respiratory vitals so like influenza<br>it was most of them 37 and many cases<br>were not in<br>positive for either sarcolonovitas to<br>other respiratory viruses as well<br>so at that point uh everything was going<br>okay with the diagnostics i mean they<br>were really really busy in the in the<br>hospital like<br>james mentioned last week so but we have<br>this<br>first case in early march and<br>the first thing that i decided to do or<br>we decided to do in my lab was<br>that we needed to sequence this we knew<br>that was positive by<br>by pcr but we needed to sequence and be<br>sure that while we we had<br>just coronavitos circulating around here<br>so with the help of joe stanton in the<br>department of anatomy here<br>in the in university of otago and<br>jackson trees<br>uh we were able to basically a little<br>bit more than one day<br>got the sample from the patient and<br>sequencing using the median of our<br>nanopore<br>system so this is just to show you that<br>that of course we sequence the full<br>length<br>genome uh based on the analysis the<br>bioinformatic analysis in show like<br>you know it seems to be a sars corner of<br>idols too<br>but then we took uh we just wanted to<br>corroborate that<br>and we took that first case and the<br>second one that was identified the next<br>day or the<br>two days later and did another approach<br>a different approach<br>we sequence against the full genome<br>using a method genomics approach<br>this time with my six and took uh just<br>less than three days to be honest<br>to sequence the full genome of the both<br>cases we did identify as you can see<br>here in this hit<br>map plot um a few other you know<br>bacterial infections of course because<br>this is a swap from the respiratory<br>tract<br>uh um that is common but not all there<br>are all the vitals<br>everything was um start calling vitals<br>too<br>so we're really excited the pcr work and<br>of course the sequences work<br>uh and at that point oh of course and we<br>did<br>some photogenetic analysis and and of<br>course a cluster<br>with the stars coronavitas 2 and which<br>is of course<br>really related to but stars like uh<br>coronavites<br>are circulating out there so at that<br>point um<br>actually even a couple of weeks before<br>that uh i made a decision that we needed<br>to work with these fighters<br>um and at that point i think that we<br>were<br>level two almost level three and many<br>universities were closing many labs were<br>closing and pretty much<br>going home like you know like the<br>government was suggested but<br>i really believe that that we really<br>needed to work with these vitals so<br>with the support of the university<br>starting from all the way from the vice<br>chancellor you know pro vice chancellor<br>uh deed and the hrd of my department uh<br>we decided that yes we should keep these<br>lab open and we should continue working<br>on such coronavitas too<br>uh so we were the only lab at some point<br>uh for the you know for the first couple<br>of months<br>that were working in in the entire<br>country and definitely<br>because we had access to our pc3 or<br>physical containment three laboratory<br>that is able to work with stars<br>at the roof of our building<br>so we continued working on that we got<br>of course all the permits and you know<br>it was a hard process to get all these<br>done<br>but uh basically 10 days later we got<br>that first sample that<br>was sequenced you know a couple of weeks<br>before<br>and and rawley has been the one champion<br>you know this is that rodriguez<br>working in my lab working you know<br>really hard for the last three months<br>and you know four months<br>in the pc3 so taking these uh the<br>pharyngeal swabs from this patient<br>uh we basically infected veto cells over<br>exposed those samples in the veto cells<br>and we were able to isolate seven<br>different sarcobitos isolates<br>and this is an example this is rather<br>working on the pc3<br>and cells infected and on a<br>non-effective way with starch<br>coronavirus<br>so i i i'm going to just take a break<br>here because at that point<br>because of the sequence we really<br>believe that was stars coronado vitals<br>based on these we really believe there<br>was an infection or vital infection<br>but we didn't know if the vitals that we<br>were isolated in the pc3<br>was for sure uh uh that's our scoring<br>vitas two<br>um strain okay so what what do we do<br>next of course we needed to sequence<br>that so the first thing that we did was<br>sequence<br>all seven patient derived samples uh<br>and again you're similar to what we did<br>before all of the in our<br>words are chronovitas too and then the<br>next thing that we did was<br>sequence the vital isolate the the one<br>that brother was able to get in<br>in the lab uh and again this is the full<br>genome<br>and i mean not one more surprise and<br>this is the<br>kind of result that we were looking for<br>and not only<br>we we determined that yes those vitals<br>that were growing in the pc3 lab were<br>subscribers too but as you can see here<br>in these<br>phallitic tree every single virus<br>matches the sample<br>of the sequence of the vitals that come<br>from the patient<br>so to to you know 100 so at that point<br>we were you know really glad that we<br>have the vitals we have all the sequence<br>that we were<br>ready to go and for you know continue<br>working with these<br>with these vitals um i'm not sure<br>uh if anybody has talked before about<br>you know the biology of these vitals i'm<br>going to take the opportunity to couple<br>of slides just to show you<br>this is the sars coronavirus it's an<br>envelope vitals is a<br>rna positive strand uh genome<br>roughly 30 000 nucleotides and i just<br>want to highlight these<br>proteins this five glycoprotein and<br>everybody has been talking about<br>spike or surface glycoprotein or the ace<br>protein this is one of the most<br>important everything is important<br>of course in the vitals but this is one<br>of the most important because that's the<br>one responsible for entering the binding<br>receptor and entering the cell and it is<br>one of the main targets for<br>neutralization and of course for vaccine<br>development as well<br>okay so just like us everybody around<br>the globe has been sequencing fully<br>length genomes of these viruses as of<br>yesterday i think if i remember<br>correctly there was more than 55<br>000 uh genomes of these vitals has been<br>sequenced<br>and in this database you can see that<br>people have been tracking<br>uh all these different what it seems to<br>be cleared<br>and and we can talk about these and i'm<br>sure that people will have questions<br>about<br>um that could or not have phenotypic<br>differences of these viruses that could<br>increase other vital<br>vitals and so transmissibility so but<br>these<br>clays of these distribution clusters and<br>follow the led3<br>are based on you know a few mutations<br>that you can see this is the genome of<br>the virus<br>and the diversity of all these strains<br>so what we did of course<br>because we had the the full sequence of<br>our viruses well these are the different<br>mutations as you can see<br>compared with any other rna vitals like<br>hiv or influenza or even hepatitis c<br>they're not that many mutations but i<br>want to just draw your attention to<br>these ones<br>the d614g and the spike that people some<br>people have been trying to<br>associate these with a better<br>replication capacity at least in vitro<br>and cell culture<br>or even increased transmissibility some<br>people have been saying oh this virus is<br>increasing the vital lens is going<br>mutating it's gonna get<br>worse uh again we can talk more about<br>that later<br>so we found uh let me go back for a<br>second we found the four of our<br>basically half of our vitals they have<br>that mutation that they already have<br>they don't have it so we did vital<br>kinetics<br>you know to see how the vitals were<br>replicated in real cells in the cell<br>line<br>and we don't see any difference between<br>those two viruses we're repeating that<br>in the primary cells to see if we see<br>any difference but<br>in our in our hands we're not seeing any<br>difference between those two viruses<br>another thing that we have been doing<br>with dr bostina in our<br>in our department again uh he's an<br>expert in electron microscopy<br>and for anybody that wanted to see this<br>is the vital circulated in new zealand<br>um and that these are really red dot<br>of course artificial color by dr bosina<br>uh<br>but those are individual vital particles<br>in ourselves<br>so what's next um so<br>one of the first thing that we did once<br>we got that virus in in<br>from the from the pc3 was in in<br>increase of production and distribution<br>of sars coronavitos material including<br>rna and non-infectious virus<br>because if you remember at the beginning<br>what was mentioned is that<br>we didn't have any positive controls<br>when we were developing these so a lot<br>of people have been asking<br>us uh to use rna for diagnosis or any<br>other project that they may be<br>interested across the country so we have<br>been circulating<br>or sharing these these material with<br>with a lot of<br>we have been in a collaborator with with<br>a lot of people that are<br>working you know developing diagnosis uh<br>diagnostic kits<br>for a diagnostic test for copying actin<br>and especially doctor john stilenton<br>again with a pointer<br>for the car test and um some using<br>micrornas<br>based diagnostics as well uh we just got<br>approval for for a project to work on<br>this infection and reuse or<br>personal protective equipment which is<br>extremely important as you can imagine i<br>mean<br>we have a scarce number of of these<br>this pbe and we need to start reusing it<br>and<br>and that's a project that we're going to<br>start running in in collaboration with<br>the university of auckland<br>dr yvonne anderson we are participating<br>in a few clinical studies uh<br>uh as well and i'm not gonna listen to<br>all of them<br>um there are some examples of course as<br>you can imagine<br>um everybody wants to test something<br>against these vitals and because we have<br>it and we have the<br>capability to work with that in our pc3<br>lab we have been testing small molecules<br>of chemicals<br>peptides and peptoids natural products<br>even soluble<br>h2 uh receptors uh i cannot talk<br>that much about these but uh as you can<br>imagine everybody around the<br>and around the world is doing something<br>similar uh<br>up to gesture there are 284<br>different you know projects testing<br>these these<br>different drugs and close to 200 in<br>human trials already<br>vaccine development the same more than<br>200 around the globe 23 of that in<br>clinical trials<br>and we are involved in a couple of you<br>know efforts here in new zealand to<br>develop a vaccine<br>for for our country as well and i'm sure<br>that uh<br>james will talk a little bit more about<br>that in a second<br>so here i mean a lot of people have been<br>asking me about how is it to work in the<br>pc3 so<br>i mean i'm going to ask permission here<br>to just show you a one minute<br>video uh of what it is to work in in the<br>pc3 and you will see<br>rodri uh what he has been doing for the<br>last<br>i'm not sure that there is that audio<br>there but i'm gonna<br>uh<br>so<br>as you can imagine there is a lot of<br>work that has to be done just to get in<br>and out of that facility and of course<br>working in the facility itself so on<br>that note i just want to<br>you know finish with acknowledging our<br>team and that people have been working<br>really hard for the last three or four<br>months so<br>i would say five months now ever since i<br>started like i say with a conversation<br>with james back in my office in january<br>uh blair and brother and my team uh that<br>have been you know<br>seems locked down three four all the we<br>have been<br>working in uh you know side by side in<br>the lab<br>my lab manager dr leonardo hernandez has<br>a<br>great support you know growing sales<br>produce supporting all the work that we<br>have been<br>doing in the lab of course joe jackson<br>and robert um<br>for the sequencing mignon for the<br>electron microscopy<br>james and jenny partners in crime since<br>the beginning<br>and of course our institutional<br>biological safety committee and megan<br>coleman<br>uh with all the support of our work in<br>the pc3 just to be sure that we are<br>doing<br>what we're supposed to be doing in in<br>the lab and the funding support from the<br>university of otago and me and<br>the western family chair invited back to<br>genesis so<br>thank you questions thank you<br>one or two questions coming through<br>firstly the presentation was really<br>informative<br>and amazing which small molecule so far<br>has found has have you found to be most<br>effective<br>and which route will be more effective<br>for delivery of drone or vaccine<br>well so far we we in in our lab we're<br>still working with this is early stages<br>so<br>um and even if we have something i can i<br>cannot disclose it but<br>uh most people know that the the the<br>drug that is is<br>working the best so far is the<br>rendezvous from gilead in the u.s<br>is a drug that is blocking the rna<br>polymerase of the vitals it blocks the<br>ability of the virus to replicate<br>um and is currently delivering you know<br>intervention obviously<br>but ideally would be to get something<br>that people can take<br>as appeal okay uh we just learned uh<br>i think it was yesterday that the u.s is<br>gonna try to sequester that<br>and they're gonna try to pile up when<br>deserving here for the next three months<br>so we're not going to have it available<br>for the rest of the war anytime soon<br>um so we need to continue working on<br>these and trying to find alternatives to<br>rendezvous<br>thank you just a question for me can you<br>comment on the significance of the<br>t cell mediated response as opposed to<br>the antibody<br>immediate response i believe there's a<br>there is some so there is a slight<br>difference<br>um but just to be honest i'm going to<br>pass that question to the immunologist<br>so i'm sure that uh james will be<br>talking more about that in<br>a second and then we're going to ask yep<br>thank you probably<br>we're waiting for a few more questions<br>to come through um are there any slides<br>perhaps you'd like to go back to or any<br>other points you'd like to emphasize in<br>your presentation<br>no i just i just wanted to show what we<br>have been doing in the lab i mean<br>stay tuned because in the next couple of<br>months we're going to have plenty of<br>data<br>that we're gonna be able to to share uh<br>i just wanted to<br>you know tell the story of what we have<br>been doing for the last you know few<br>months<br>look like the the pc3 is a yeah<br>quite a mission to get in and out of and<br>to decontamination and the constant<br>health and safety checks must be quite<br>risky that's correct i mean rodri or<br>whoever is going to work and always<br>working in the pc3 cannot stay there for<br>more than<br>four hours so you have to get all suited<br>and you know<br>be trained to work in the pc3 of course<br>um and then after getting out you have<br>to go and take a shower and<br>all that so it's plenty of work uh bo<br>is really well equipped and suited to<br>for this work so<br>we're really excited i'm pleased to have<br>the pc3 without the pc3 we wouldn't be<br>able to do anything<br>how do scientists communicate while in<br>the pc3 lane<br>actually it's really well equipped and<br>we have wi-fi there computers we have an<br>ipad<br>we have a phone um so rodris has been<br>communicating with me all the time<br>uh calling me via facetime or zoom or<br>whatever you know<br>okay showing me data and in the ipad and<br>then sharing that<br>that's that's really key because as you<br>can imagine<br>nothing can get out of the pc3<br>everything has to be autoclaved<br>uh unless it's inactivated and<br>disinfected and so on<br>so once but if you're working in the pc3<br>together<br>uh is is not allowed you're able to<br>communicate and talk<br>even wearing those suits do you see any<br>evidence of attenuation as you passed<br>the virus uh no not yet<br>i mean these vitals i mean we can<br>inactivate dividers with chemical agents<br>of course but attenuation you don't have<br>to pass it<br>but now we haven't done that yet i mean<br>we're passing the vitals but it will<br>take a long time<br>uh and we're not seeing any attenuation<br>to be honest of the vital circulating<br>around the glove<br>the dividers is really successful at<br>this meeting so i don't think that it's<br>going to happen anytime soon<br>okay do you think environmentation's<br>occurred in new zealand or were they<br>imported<br>although the vitals everything that<br>replicates is creating or generating<br>mutations and being selected<br>it happens all the time these vitals is<br>rna vitals<br>like i said before similar to hiv but<br>the difference<br>compared with the other rna viruses that<br>i was mentioning is that this one has a<br>proof reading ability<br>meaning that it can go back that the<br>enzyme that is copying<br>can go back and fix some of those<br>mutations<br>so it doesn't mutate that much compared<br>with other viruses<br>uh which is a good thing yeah where<br>would you predict the most virus<br>mutation to happen spike protein<br>possibly<br>and other than the ace is there another<br>entry site<br>yes um believe it or not i mean similar<br>to other viruses the envelope is<br>typically the more vital one because<br>others are the one targeted by the<br>immune system<br>and if i just have to you know mutate<br>and fermentation to escape that immune<br>system<br>or immune response uh so if you go back<br>well<br>that is like i was mentioning some of<br>the mutations were in this bike<br>but you can see it all over in you know<br>the reality is that this virus is not<br>mutating that much<br>it doesn't need to mutate it transmits<br>so well there is no selection pressure<br>right now for the virus to imitate<br>so it's doing pretty well it's doing<br>well yes<br>how many other pc3 labs are there in new<br>zealand oh that's a good question<br>um there are a couple in in auckland<br>and i think if i'm aware or maybe it's<br>definitely one in auckland a couple in<br>wellington<br>i'm not sure they were quite churches<br>that's true<br>okay so i would say there are three or<br>four more okay<br>maybe you can correct my friend<br>would you be able to comment or would<br>you be able to expand on the types of<br>international collaboration<br>that you and your team have been<br>involved with during government<br>yes it's mainly related to vaccine<br>development<br>we have been collaborating with teams in<br>the us and canada<br>and hopefully in europe in the near<br>future<br>there are some collaborations related to<br>antiviral strategies as well<br>basically drug discovery and development<br>as well<br>characterization but it's mainly related<br>to vaccine development okay<br>and a question awesome presentation<br>thank you the video was remarkable<br>would the vaccine be just for us<br>relevant to strains in new zealand or<br>worldwide<br>oh it will work it will work worldwide<br>um<br>like i say these vitals that it doesn't<br>have that many mutations one of the<br>things that we're doing in the lab is<br>remember that i mentioned that we have<br>two different two different they're<br>really<br>similar but one that had that mutation<br>in the spike and one that doesn't have<br>that mutation and because a lot of<br>people are putting<br>a lot of attention into that mutation<br>we're developing we're trying to develop<br>inactivated vaccines uh using both<br>strains one with mutation one without a<br>mutation<br>but there are different strategies that<br>we're going to be following okay<br>can you comment on the possibility of<br>antiviral resistance<br>really really good question uh one of<br>the first things that we do<br>when we're working with antivirals<br>against hiv about idc or even influenza<br>once you detect and you know that a<br>particular compound<br>small molecule peptide or whatever it is<br>it blocks the replication of the vitals<br>the next thing that you do is to try to<br>select for persistence in vitro<br>because that's gonna just check that the<br>mechanism of action of that<br>and so that's something that we should<br>do and i'm sure that people are doing<br>but it's a double star because you don't<br>want to develop the drug resistant<br>body and like to eventually escape which<br>of course is not going to happen based<br>on what we hear<br>you know all the revelations that we<br>have<br>well thank you very much professor<br>quinoa</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
