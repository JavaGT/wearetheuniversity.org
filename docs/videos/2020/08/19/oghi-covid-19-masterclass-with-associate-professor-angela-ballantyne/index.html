discuss balancing utility and<br>equity considerations<br>in icu triage angela<br>kiyokoto hi everybody um so nice to get<br>the opportunity to join you from<br>singapore<br>so my day job is at the university of<br>otago based in wellington teaching<br>medical ethics but i'm<br>in singapore on an 18-month position as<br>a visiting senior research fellow<br>with the national university of<br>singapore so we moved over here in<br>january which was an interesting time to<br>move a family of five internationally um<br>and it's just really nice to have the<br>opportunity to touch base with new<br>zealand and<br>conversations that are happening there<br>i this it's just loading<br>okay okay have you got that jackie does<br>that look good from your end<br>great so today i want to talk to you<br>about balancing utility and equity<br>considerations in icu triage<br>and try and cover this topic reasonably<br>efficiently so that we can have some<br>questions at the end<br>so a few kind of preliminary comments<br>about ethics<br>i think it's i think medical students<br>for example and others often think<br>that doing an ethical analysis will take<br>a complex problem and simplify it<br>and sadly and much to their frustration<br>i think that's not necessarily the case<br>so<br>in my view what an ethics analysis can<br>do<br>is take something that's opaque and make<br>it more transparent but in the process<br>that sometimes just makes things look<br>more complex so i give you that warning<br>um<br>up front as we get into things today<br>uh everything i'm going to put on the<br>table today sits within what we<br>sometimes call an ethics the gray zone<br>so there's reason there's room for<br>reasonable disagreement about the values<br>and considerations i'm going to put<br>forward i'm not gonna say you know<br>nothing in the talk today is really<br>um an example of sort of egregious uh<br>ethical wrong so it's pretty much all on<br>the table and there's lots of room<br>for reasonable disagreement and the last<br>comment i'll make is that<br>bioethics or medical ethics is an<br>applied discipline<br>so that means we need to debate not just<br>the values and abstract<br>but think about how to apply them or<br>operationalize them in practice<br>and just as medicine requires good data<br>bioethics requires good evidence as well<br>and so<br>that's obviously particularly<br>problematic at the moment in relation to<br>covert because um<br>you know there's so much uncertainty and<br>so much emerging data<br>regarding prognosis um infection spread<br>and so on<br>so it's a little bit you know it's<br>tricky doing medicine and it's also<br>tricky doing<br>bioethics well in conditions of<br>uncertainty<br>so quick summary i'm just going to move<br>my view thing there okay<br>uh this is essentially what we're going<br>to talk about today or what i'm going to<br>talk about i'm going to focus primarily<br>on this tension between<br>triage tools that focus on saving the<br>most lives<br>versus an equity consideration and i'll<br>define equity in more detail later on<br>but for now we can think about it as<br>providing people with the resources they<br>need to have a fairer chance at<br>surviving<br>particularly if they need acute care<br>one of the problems i think we've seen<br>in the debate about icu triage so far is<br>that<br>certainly the early debate seemed to um<br>treat icu<br>as a valuable resource that was simply<br>life-saving and all of the debate was<br>about<br>who was going to get into icu and who<br>was going to get this life-saving<br>resource<br>but when we think about how to apply<br>ethical principles as i said they need<br>to be grounded in reality and the<br>reality with icu is that icu is<br>burdensome care<br>um it will often prolong death and<br>suffering and it's true that the frailer<br>the patient<br>is the higher the likelihood that icu<br>will actually do harm rather than<br>benefit so that<br>um complicates the question around<br>triage as well<br>that means i think that if we're<br>thinking about equity in the context<br>of covert we need to be thinking more<br>broadly than just icu<br>and be thinking about um you know we<br>know that the majority of patients that<br>end up in icu<br>and certainly our mechanical ventilation<br>will actually die we need to be thinking<br>about quality end-of-life care<br>in the pandemic and that includes a<br>focus on palliative care advanced care<br>planning<br>using scarce resources um ppe for<br>example to allow<br>visitors for patients at the end of life<br>so that gives you an overview<br>of the content for today so to start<br>with these are the key ethical<br>principles<br>that are invoked in relation to triage<br>conversations<br>um and i'm not talking about new zealand<br>specifically now you know<br>talking um based on the literature and<br>conversations i've been involved with<br>here in singapore<br>with groups in germany groups in the us<br>as well<br>so i'm going to start with the orange<br>overwhelmingly the<br>primary focus of icu triage is on saving<br>the most<br>lives now this can be divided into<br>saving the most lives versus more<br>technically<br>saving the most life years the<br>difference there is how you count so<br>uh say you had a patient that survives<br>three um to three months post<br>this tag icu discharge you have another<br>patient that survives<br>for 12 months and one patient that<br>survives for five years if you're just<br>counting live saved all of those three<br>patients are counted equally<br>if you're counting life years saved and<br>the patient that survives for five years<br>counts for more<br>so technically a lot of triage documents<br>are focused on saving the most life<br>years but for simplicity's sake today<br>i'm just going to refer to that idea as<br>saving the most lives<br>generally now the first pushback we saw<br>was from disability rights groups who<br>argued that the initial triage documents<br>were discriminatory on the grounds that<br>they might have excluded categorically<br>excluded<br>people with certain disabilities they<br>might have had age cut-offs and so we<br>saw legal action in the uk<br>and in the us and different states in<br>the u.s<br>pushing back against those exclusion<br>criteria and icu<br>triage documents that was sort of the<br>first wave of critique and then the<br>second wave of critique was around<br>equity<br>and i think it's important to understand<br>the distinction between<br>a triage document that avoids being<br>discriminatory<br>um and one that avoids uh having an<br>inequitable outcome<br>because the non-discrimination critique<br>is actually a lot easier to deal with<br>than the equity critique<br>so even triage documents that got rid of<br>terminology<br>um or criteria around quality<br>use of qualities quality adjusted life<br>years on the grounds that those are<br>inherently biased against people with<br>disabilities<br>and focus instead just on triage<br>according to survivability<br>um or you know prospective benefit those<br>triage documents<br>still had to classify patients according<br>to their<br>current and prior health status and<br>that's largely based on comorbidities<br>and those comorbidities might include<br>for example hypertension<br>asthma chronic respiratory disease<br>diabetes<br>and what happens is that it can look<br>like an apparently neutral tool on the<br>surface right it's treating people<br>similarly but because those underlying<br>health conditions aren't equally<br>distributed amongst the community<br>and we know in new zealand that people<br>um who<br>live in poverty certain ethnic<br>communities maori and pacifica<br>have higher rates of those comorbidities<br>if we plug them into that icu triage<br>tool we're still going to get<br>inequitable access to icu between<br>different groups in the community<br>so the equity critique<br>is much harder to deal with than a<br>non-discrimination critique and that's<br>because the equity critique<br>and the whole idea of kind of judging<br>survivability are sort of<br>inherently in conflict so those are the<br>three big ethical values<br>that would kind of motivate<br>most triage documents<br>the next three that i'm going to mention<br>are often used as tie breakers so that's<br>when you might have two patients<br>who come out as kind of ranking equally<br>based on these<br>bigger or more primary ethical concerns<br>and you might use these<br>to distinguish between those kind of<br>equal patients so the first is the life<br>stages principle<br>now this uh attempts to avoid<br>discrimination on the grounds of age but<br>does say<br>that it would be relevant to consider<br>where in a life course someone is<br>so you wouldn't distinguish between a<br>patient who's 63 and 65<br>but you might distinguish between a<br>patient who's 25<br>45 or 65 on the ground that if one of<br>those patients were to die the younger<br>patient has missed out<br>on a larger proportion of their natural<br>life so that's the life stages principle<br>so reciprocity so reciprocity says um<br>that certain<br>people have stepped up in the pandemic<br>and<br>have put themselves on the front line<br>have taken on extraordinary heroic<br>risks you know often for example health<br>workers working without adequate ppe<br>and um they've done that for the benefit<br>of society so if they were to fall<br>sick as a result of that action they<br>should get priority access to the<br>resources that they need<br>for treatment different values<br>instrumental value this might<br>also be used to prioritize um access<br>to care for example for healthcare<br>workers or other frontline workers<br>but the logic behind it is quite<br>different from the reciprocity argument<br>here the idea is that some members of<br>the community<br>have instrumental value because of the<br>expertise they have and the role they<br>have<br>and that there's a priority protecting<br>them so they can continue to serve the<br>community<br>and or treating them and getting them<br>back in the health system if they fall<br>sick<br>so those are the gives you some idea of<br>the different kind of and complex<br>ethical values that might apply to<br>triage decisions<br>so i'm just having a little bit of<br>trouble with my screen there we go i'm<br>going to focus primarily on comparing<br>the light<br>save the most lives approach and the<br>equity approach<br>so it's fair to say that in the<br>literature the absolute<br>um kind of dominant view is that in a<br>pandemic or an emergency<br>you need to focus primarily if not<br>exclusively just on saving the most<br>lives<br>so ezekiel emanuel is probably the most<br>influential bioethicist in america and<br>this<br>new england journal of medicine paper<br>that came out earlier this year has been<br>very influential<br>they argue that priority for limited<br>resources should aim both at saving the<br>most lives and at maximizing<br>in individuals post-treatment length of<br>life um<br>the next quote is a philosopher from<br>germany as a basic rule we try to act in<br>such a way that the largest number of<br>people survive<br>that's because it's in the public<br>interest and finally john wilkinson<br>who's a philosopher<br>excellent philosopher in oxford who<br>actually visits new zealand<br>um often so you might have had the<br>chance to see dom speak yourself<br>he argues that the ethical balance must<br>shift to emphasizing benefit<br>um in a pandemic this will mean<br>prioritizing intensive care for patients<br>who have the highest chance of surviving<br>and this is a graph from john<br>wilkinson's paper and you can see here<br>that<br>he acknowledges that fairness<br>considerations or equity considerations<br>are relevant in normal times but as we<br>get to triage and crisis<br>the primary focus becomes on benefit the<br>exclusive focus becomes on benefit<br>what i think is really interesting about<br>the new zealand response is that i don't<br>think this characterizes<br>a lot of the debate in new zealand and<br>you and i think that's rare from what i<br>have seen<br>so in new zealand um i think we're much<br>more comfortable<br>with wanting to keep equity as part of<br>the conversation even in an emergency<br>context<br>so the problem with saving the most<br>lives is that<br>by default um you're likely to end up<br>saving white middle-class lives<br>and that's because those people of<br>privilege come into the epidemic<br>with a higher health status and so when<br>we plug them into a triage tool<br>they're more likely to score highly on<br>the grounds of survivability<br>and we've seen this critique very<br>clearly overseas um both these graphs<br>show data one from the us and one from<br>the uk<br>around the disproportionate impact of<br>covert people of color<br>so and what both of them do is suggest<br>what you would ex the numbers you would<br>expect to see based on share of<br>population so we can see over here<br>um that for example in louisiana african<br>americans account for 32<br>of the population but they've accounted<br>for 70 of<br>deaths relating from covert um similar<br>data we're seeing in the uk<br>that uh people of color having<br>disproportionately high<br>death rates relative to white people<br>so that's a problem um obviously<br>what i want to say is at the heart of<br>this tension between<br>saving the most lives and equity is<br>whether we just want to focus<br>on how many lives we save or we also<br>want to focus<br>on whose lives get saved because if you<br>have a limited set of<br>resources and you're focused on using<br>those to save lives<br>the priority is going to be saving the<br>lives of<br>the easy lives so in a very uh<br>kind of you know hypothetical example<br>you might say you could use those<br>resources to save 100 lives<br>but they might end up being<br>predominantly white middle class or you<br>could save 80 lives by investing some of<br>those resources and people who have um<br>need more resources to get the same<br>health outcome but you might end up<br>saving a much more diverse<br>group of people so equity as defined by<br>the world health organization<br>is the absence of avoidable unfair or<br>remediable differences among groups of<br>people whether those groups are defined<br>socially economically demographically or<br>geographically<br>and i think this is really important<br>because often people will<br>kind of acknowledge equity but won't<br>necessarily be prepared to take<br>you know to carry the burden that equity<br>would require and that might mean<br>saving fewer lives overall so that gives<br>you an idea of the tension between<br>saving the most lives versus equity and<br>then we move on to if we did want to<br>adopt an equity lens how might we apply<br>that in icu<br>so here i just want to make the point<br>that when we're talking about resource<br>allocation the type of resource really<br>matters<br>applying an equity lens to something<br>like ppe is much more straightforward<br>than applying an equity lens to icu<br>triage<br>that's because ppe is essentially just a<br>valuable good keeps you safe and it's<br>not pleasant to wear<br>um it's uncomfortable but it's not it's<br>not harmful<br>and so and it gives you freedom of<br>movement the opportunity to move safely<br>in a wider range of spaces<br>vaccines also you know tiny risk but<br>largely<br>a valuable good and so when we have<br>debates about<br>how best to allocate vaccines when they<br>become available<br>that's a different debate to talking<br>about icu triage<br>and i think that difference was missed<br>in some of the early bioethics<br>literature<br>about icu triage it's important to<br>realize that icu<br>isn't just life-saving but in fact um<br>is burdensome care and can sometimes<br>prolong death and exacerbate suffering<br>now it's a little bit hard comparing<br>data from different icus because those<br>different icus are set in different<br>health systems<br>and have different admission criteria<br>but what we've started to see is that<br>between 50 to 90 percent<br>um of patients with mechanical<br>ventilation for covert dye<br>right so we had this framing of icu as<br>this really valuable scarce resource and<br>who was going to get it<br>and the reality that you know the<br>picture changed<br>around april those patients that do<br>survive are likely to um<br>require a you know very intensive<br>rehabilitation<br>um the society for physiotherapy in the<br>uk has predicted a tsunami of<br>rehabilitation needs<br>icu is associated with muscle atrophy<br>deconditioning<br>sleep disorders severe fatigue<br>post-traumatic stress syndrome<br>cognitive deficits depression anxiety<br>loss of employment<br>difficulty and performing daily<br>activities so even patients that survive<br>uh have a really long road to recovery<br>ahead of them<br>that i think means that if we want to<br>apply an equity lens<br>and we are prepared to use some of our<br>resources to focus on equity<br>in the context of icu we can't just be<br>looking<br>at expanding the admission criteria um<br>to allow frailer patients into icu<br>because the risk there<br>is that we get to the point where on the<br>grounds of equity<br>we're admitting patients to icu with<br>covert when it's actually not in their<br>best interests<br>so to assess whether it's in people's<br>best interests we need a lot more<br>investment and services around that<br>process so we need to broaden the scope<br>of what we're talking about<br>scaling up investment in palliative care<br>absolutely needs to be part of country's<br>pandemic response<br>we need i think investment and<br>communication teams to support<br>families and patients with covert<br>making decisions about their future care<br>that are in line with their values<br>um i think we can invest money in<br>advanced care planning<br>for patients that we think might be um<br>at higher risk<br>not all of this applies to new zealand<br>because of the situation new zealand's<br>in at the moment but for countries that<br>are<br>um where the health systems have been<br>more overwhelmed i think these are<br>good ways of channeling resources that<br>might have an<br>impact on vulnerable communities more so<br>than arguing that those vulnerable<br>communities should be<br>admitted to icu visitors is another<br>issue um<br>if many patients with critical covert<br>are going to die i think it's<br>worth having the debate about whether<br>allocating scarce ppe to allow visitors<br>at the end of life<br>is a justifiable use of resources i<br>think you know potentially it is<br>so in summary the majority of<br>triage documents focus primarily if not<br>exclusively on saving the most lives<br>that hits up right against equity<br>considerations and it's likely to mean<br>that the lives we saved are the lives of<br>privileged people<br>many of us are concerned about equity<br>and are prepared to put our money where<br>our mouths are<br>and investing in equity responses but<br>how to do that in icu is actually really<br>complicated<br>and i'll wrap up there so we've got time<br>thank you angela i think people are<br>digesting what you've said and thinking<br>about it and cogitating because we<br>haven't had any questions come through<br>yet<br>okay so um if you'd like to perhaps<br>share any additional insights while we<br>wait for a few<br>questions to come through is there<br>anything else you'd like to emphasize<br>again<br>so i think so i can give you another<br>example around the clash between<br>um say utility and equity uh<br>outside of the cover situation which<br>might make that clear as well<br>so in the early 2000s i was working at<br>the world health organization<br>and at that point who and the un had<br>launched a really ambitious initiative<br>to get three million people<br>on antiretrovirals by 2005<br>and this was ambitious in that it was<br>sort of the first move towards really<br>rolling out antiretrovirals in low and<br>middle income<br>settings but at that point the estimates<br>were that<br>approximately six million million people<br>would require immediate access to<br>antiretrovirals<br>so the question was how do you pick the<br>three million out of the six million who<br>are going to get priority access and one<br>debate there not so much around<br>ethnicity was around do you roll out the<br>resources in urban settings<br>where you're going to get the most bang<br>for your buck because you can more<br>efficiently access a higher number of<br>people<br>or do you do you use some of the<br>resources to set up testing and<br>treatment um<br>outreach clinics in rural areas where<br>you would reach more disadvantaged<br>people<br>and so that balance between um yeah<br>whether you just go with a kind of<br>strict<br>uh save the most lives or do the most<br>benefit or whether you<br>um use some of your resources to focus<br>on kind of equity and justice i think um<br>yeah it's another good example of<br>demonstrating that tension um not around<br>ethnicity in this case but around<br>rural versus urban populations<br>yeah i remember that well being in the<br>hiv field myself and uh oh right<br>it came up a lot so yeah yeah i'm using<br>my waffling a little bit because we<br>don't have any questions we just got two<br>very positive comments for you firstly<br>um really interesting and relevant thank<br>you very much mihi nui<br>and thank you angela as always excellent<br>and clear<br>and ah here is a question okay um<br>isn't there a tension between equity as<br>applied to population groups<br>versus decisions made in relation to<br>individual patients<br>including a point of triage for icu<br>entry<br>which by the way should never occur<br>unless it is judged to offer reasonable<br>probability of benefit<br>yeah i think that's right and i think<br>coming back to that point about<br>reasonable probability<br>of benefit um is critical<br>and what's a little bit tricky about the<br>icu trio<br>debate is that you know we're sort of<br>trying to develop<br>guidance without necessarily having a<br>clear idea of what the demand<br>necessarily is so<br>i think it's clear i say we take an<br>example where systems are clearly<br>overwhelmed and you've got 50 people who<br>you think<br>could have clear probability of benefit<br>it's in their best interest you would<br>want to admit all of them<br>but you only have room 10 beds available<br>and within that 50 you can use a<br>clinical scoring system<br>to rank them do you just give the beds<br>to those to patients one to ten<br>or um do you give patient the beds to<br>patients one to eight<br>but then you notice that patients 15 and<br>patient 22 rank highly on some<br>equity um account that you've uh<br>acknowledged is relevant up front and so<br>you give<br>the beds to patients 1 to 8 15 and then<br>22.<br>all of those patients still then stand<br>to benefit you're not sort of dipping<br>down into the um<br>patients 60 and 70 where it's more<br>concerning<br>but because the situation is moving so<br>fluidly it's hard to write triage tools<br>um that kind of make that point and so<br>you know thank you for<br>reiterating that is there a difference<br>between<br>equity applied to populations and equity<br>applied to individuals<br>um i think equity works<br>it's easier to implement at a population<br>level so when you're looking at<br>allocating resources<br>um to population so you're looking at<br>investing in<br>doctors to set up a clinic in a high<br>needs area in new zealand right that's<br>more straightforward<br>when you're judging between individual<br>patients that does become more difficult<br>but i don't think<br>yeah i don't think this i don't think<br>there's necessarily no role for it but<br>it does<br>um it's a much pointy end of the wedge i<br>think what<br>uh people who are concerned about<br>missing out<br>on resources would argue and this is you<br>know disability rights advocates<br>and so on that you can talk the talk<br>at a population level but if you're<br>always making decisions<br>against the interests of marginalized<br>groups at the individual level<br>that breeds a lot of distrust and and<br>thank you angela they're coming in thick<br>and fast now<br>okay how different or similar are these<br>utility equity concerns to icu<br>admissions outside a pandemic situation<br>um so i think they're relatively similar<br>i think we should hold the same<br>values um uh to heart i think you'll see<br>it's interesting that you know john<br>wilkinson's view is that the equity<br>there's lots of room for discussion of<br>fairness and equity in normal<br>situations but not when we get into a<br>kind of crisis<br>triage situation um i would<br>disagree with that in part because i<br>think the<br>narratives that we form around icu i<br>mean<br>on one level while we were talking about<br>icu right like there's so many more<br>um there's so many more other elements<br>of the pandemic and the pandemic<br>response that are going to have a huge<br>impact on people's quality of life their<br>income their health long term<br>we talk about icu because it's the<br>pointy end of the wedge and it's really<br>evocative in people's minds<br>and that means that this public interest<br>and the sorts of values that we say are<br>important at that point and the kinds of<br>narratives we build around that and<br>that's going to have a legacy<br>of trust or distrust for populations<br>moving forward<br>um so that's why i think uh that we need<br>to<br>i don't think we should be throwing<br>equity out um or fairness out because<br>we're in a crisis situation<br>now if the crisis was such that you know<br>we were looking at community collapse as<br>a whole<br>um and you know the survival of only a<br>tiny percentage of us<br>then i think in those circumstances<br>maybe we do focus just on<br>survival but i don't think that's where<br>we are um at the moment<br>thanks a great question have you have<br>you seen any examples of ic triage tools<br>that overtly include an equity lens<br>great question um no so there's lots of<br>talk about it uh and i've seen this in<br>various different spaces<br>so um colleagues in actually won't say<br>where these were so some people have<br>talked about in some areas um<br>with your clinical scoring having bonus<br>points for um<br>ethnicity so for example if you know<br>that if you just plug in the clinical<br>scores<br>that's going to mean that you have very<br>few african-americans<br>do you add on bonus scores for groups<br>that you know<br>are already coming into the pandemic<br>with<br>health inequities particularly that<br>result from systemic<br>prior systemic injustice that's one<br>option one is do you allocate a certain<br>number of beds<br>for high needs patients um do you move<br>resources around<br>a community to ensure that there's more<br>resources on hand you know at high needs<br>um<br>hospitals are just you'll know in the us<br>uh lots of medical providers<br>you know were shipped into new york uh<br>to help deal with that<br>uh would you also allocate you know<br>health resources and that way<br>to um communities that were<br>high needs because of um you know<br>historical injustice<br>that said um no there's a lot of talk<br>about equity but how you actually do it<br>on the day<br>um is much harder yeah thank you angela<br>um i read an article about a person with<br>disability michael hickson in texas this<br>week<br>uh are you familiar with the texas<br>10-day futility rule<br>and if so do you have any comment on it<br>i'm not i know i'm familiar with the<br>article actually um<br>and i think that just really speaks to<br>the distrust um<br>and the and the difficulty of<br>communicating between these two groups<br>because i'll speak to clinicians who are<br>really worried about futility and not<br>harming patients you know and that's<br>that's a genuine concern and then i<br>speak to disability groups<br>who will say clinicians always use the<br>term futility as a way of withholding<br>resources from us right and we don't buy<br>that one bit and we want those resources<br>um and that's because of you know<br>historical<br>failure to listen to<br>uh people with disabilities and treat<br>them equitably<br>and so then taking that kind of baggage<br>into a<br>pandemic it just makes those<br>conversations really difficult i'm i'm<br>not familiar with the<br>uh texas 10-day futility law but i'm<br>going to look that up afterwards that<br>sounds really interesting<br>thanks okay as you may know<br>case interview and subsequent close<br>contact management in aotearoa was<br>severely stressed early in our pandemic<br>how do you think ethical considerations<br>right so in terms of early testing and<br>rather than triage yeah i mean so<br>basically an equity model says you want<br>to<br>um distribute the resources in a way<br>that avoids<br>unfair or avoidable or remediable<br>differences between<br>groups um so rather than just looking at<br>um where you get the most bang for your<br>buck you would look at which groups<br>had higher needs and roll resources out<br>that way i mean one thing i didn't<br>mention about equity is that there's<br>two different ways of interpreting<br>equity it might just be that<br>one group has higher needs because of<br>some sort of innate biological<br>or you know feature so for example if<br>you have children and one's a growing<br>teenager they're going to want to eat a<br>lot more and so you probably give them<br>more food you don't give them equal<br>amounts of food<br>but then a lot of the high needs don't<br>just kind of arise<br>out of nowhere they're caused by<br>historical injustice so then you have an<br>obligation not just to<br>meet the needs of those communities<br>because they're higher needs but because<br>you're addressing<br>um historical injustice towards those<br>groups and a large part of that<br>requires giving um giving up power and<br>the privilege that we have and actually<br>listening to those groups that have<br>higher needs around how they think those<br>resources<br>should be allocated and how um policies<br>should be rolled out within their<br>communities so it's power sharing as<br>much as resource sharing<br>true uh one more question did we discuss<br>when to remove someone from icu i.e not<br>at their request<br>yes wonderful great and so there's lots<br>of stuff that i didn't get to talk about<br>um<br>focusing just on the ethical issues but<br>there's a bunch of other stuff about<br>process<br>so yes uh withdrawing from icu is just<br>as critical as<br>um when we admit people to icu um time<br>trials limited time trials of icu are<br>really critical and again then one way<br>of thinking about equity is that you<br>might extend those time trials<br>for people of disadvantaged groups you<br>might give them a little bit longer um<br>so you could adjust time trials that way<br>uh the other really important aspect of<br>icu triage is having<br>the systems that are really overwhelmed<br>having icu triage committees<br>that and don't involve the clinician<br>making these one-on-one decisions about<br>their patients and that's for two<br>reasons one to ensure consistency and<br>fairness of decision making<br>and also to relieve clinicians of that<br>burden um<br>because we're seeing as a really<br>legitimate concern about long-term um<br>burnout and psychological<br>distress for clinicians that have had to<br>work and um overwhelmed health systems<br>on the pandemic<br>so thank you for bringing that up it's a<br>really great point<br>thank you associate professor angela<br>ballentine thank you for joining us from<br>singapore<br>a nice early morning for you yeah thank<br>you so much it was such a pleasure to<br>speak to you all enjoy the rest of your<br>day</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
