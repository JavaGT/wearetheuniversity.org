infectious disease physician and<br>epidemiologist in the department of<br>pathology<br>at the university of otago wellington dr<br>susan jack<br>is a public health specialist and<br>epidemiologist and is a medical officer<br>of health<br>at the southern regional dhb dr<br>andrew cheng is a research fellow with<br>koi2 center for informed futures<br>aisha<br>today i'm going to discuss the<br>experience with contact racing in new<br>zealand and work i did to evaluate our<br>contact racing system<br>and as part of that we're going to<br>define what good contact tracing is<br>and set out an evaluation framework<br>if you don't already know i am a<br>labelist candidate for the general<br>election so please bear that in mind<br>so contact tracing is an established<br>public health method that's used for a<br>variety of communicable diseases as part<br>of control<br>for covert 19 contact tracing is the<br>identification<br>and isolation of people who have been<br>exposed to an infectious case<br>and that prevents onwards transmission<br>from the contact to others<br>other contact racing for other illnesses<br>leads to other interventions so for<br>example in tuberculosis to prophylactic<br>treatment<br>uh and and some other illnesses to<br>vaccination<br>so new zealand has a contact racing<br>system uh that has devolved to<br>public health units and twelve pub and<br>there are 12 of them across the country<br>uh contact tracing is performed<br>routinely in these units for diseases<br>like tuberculosis<br>and during other outbreaks so pandemic<br>influenza h1n1<br>and mumps and measles outbreaks in<br>recent years<br>we know from the h1n1 influenza pandemic<br>that an<br>enduring problem has been fragmented in<br>information systems<br>so<br>public health units each have their own<br>contact<br>information system and this can be quite<br>sophisticated<br>in those public health units that are<br>supported by large dhbs<br>but in smaller public health units<br>that's not the case<br>and it's hard to share information<br>across across the system<br>as a whole or to get good data for<br>reporting<br>so this is for contacts it's in contrast<br>to cases<br>for which we do have a national<br>notification system called episerve<br>i said that um public health<br>responsibility has devolved there is<br>a emergency management plan for<br>public health emergencies but also for<br>civil defense that requires an all of<br>government response<br>but the operational arrangements for<br>coordinating parts of the public health<br>response like<br>contact racing were not defined in those<br>in those protocols<br>uh before we talk about how um the<br>system<br>can be evaluated it's worthwhile just to<br>set the<br>context with covert 19 in in new zealand<br>and um please remember uh<br>that we when we started our<br>um pandemic we probably had the capacity<br>to trace just 10<br>cases in their contacts a day<br>and that's from cabinet documents that<br>have<br>uh recently been released new zealand<br>diagnosed its first case of covert 19 on<br>the 28th of february<br>and there was a rapid effort to expand<br>public health<br>unit capacity by redeploying our staff<br>for contact racing<br>through march we saw an increase in<br>cases and the development of local<br>clusters at the end of end of march on<br>the 20th of march our borders were<br>closed except to<br>returning new zealanders and there was a<br>rapid escalation through alert levels<br>and on 24th of march an alert a level 4<br>lockdown<br>was introduced to prevent an outbreak<br>as we went into that lockdown we were at<br>about 60 uh<br>and then more cases per day and at that<br>stage um<br>uh official documents also reflect that<br>the<br>capacity for contact racing was probably<br>about 50 cases per day with the<br>additional<br>resource that have been moved into<br>public health units<br>at that point um a national close<br>contact service also<br>um came online which was a call<br>center-based service in the ministry of<br>health<br>uh supported by um were initially<br>supported by<br>uh paper-based procedures and later in<br>uh<br>in a digital information system uh so<br>that started just as we went into<br>lockdown and i was asked to audit the<br>contact racing system<br>on the 10th of april so in preparation<br>for that i thought to define what good<br>contact racing is<br>and we can say that if we want to make a<br>difference to the outbreak<br>or to the pandemic we need to achieve an<br>r naught of less than one<br>so contact tracing should achieve that<br>and from these two modeling studies that<br>were published<br>at the time um which use<br>each use slightly different assumptions<br>we can say that speed<br>and the completeness so the number of<br>contacts who are traced are key<br>key measures that we have to optimize to<br>achieve and are not less than one<br>there's also a related concept of<br>capacity so<br>that's i guess it's related to<br>completeness<br>and this has really been part of our<br>discourse in new zealand right from the<br>very beginning because many of us drew<br>attention to the fact that the capacity<br>in our system was limited<br>and not up to um the exponential growth<br>that<br>an outbreak um that would be occur with<br>the pandemic<br>but and it's become clear talking to<br>international colleagues that<br>a lot of them are being asked to contact<br>trace when they don't have the capacity<br>to trace a third of the cases they have<br>in their population and that's very<br>demoralizing for<br>public health authorities to know that<br>they're<br>doing this without having much impact on<br>the overall course of their outbreak<br>another important um uh characteristic<br>of contact racing is the effectiveness<br>of quarantine the whole purpose of the<br>process is to put people in quarantine<br>so unless that's effective it won't work<br>uh and then other aspects which might be<br>which are important but might be hard to<br>get quantitative data on is the<br>acceptability of to the community<br>the ability to integrate disease control<br>with welfare objectives and the equity<br>and that it has equitable outcomes<br>so we can build a conceptual model of<br>contact racing<br>uh that allows us to think of how we<br>would measure<br>these uh different characteristics of a<br>content tracing system<br>so i think we should view contact<br>tracing as<br>an a process that encapsulates all the<br>event for a case through to their<br>contacts<br>so you can see here in this model we<br>have an index case who develops symptoms<br>they present and have a sample taken a<br>diagnostic<br>test is performed this is reported to<br>public health authorities<br>they begin a case investigation and then<br>they trace the contacts and quarantine<br>them<br>and we can see from the color coding<br>here that different parts of this<br>process<br>relate to different parts of the health<br>system at least in new zealand so<br>here um the process force from symptom<br>development to a test being taken is<br>dependent<br>on community understanding of the<br>illness and access to testing<br>the turnaround test time of a test is<br>determined by laboratory performance<br>and the case investigation and contact<br>racing is performed by public health<br>units and to some extent the national<br>close contact service<br>so at each stage of this process we<br>could measure timeless completeness and<br>capacity<br>and a good information system would<br>capture<br>cases and link their data to all their<br>contacts<br>and as each step was completed<br>uh generate a time stamp and that would<br>allow us to<br>monitor the performance of the system<br>and then we can break down into detail<br>um<br>measurements of the contact tracing<br>process so the first<br>is the capacity as a whole which isn't<br>really a performance indicator<br>but does need to be known it does change<br>over time and unless you know the<br>capacity of your system you can't make<br>decisions during an outbreak about how<br>to allocate resources and work across<br>the country<br>then the next two relate to access and<br>timeliness of testing<br>associated in purple and you can see<br>that<br>so you can measure the time for a<br>person's symptom a cases onset of<br>symptom to testing<br>and also the proportion of those who<br>meet the case definition<br>who have a test done that one is the<br>second one is quite a hard one to<br>measure and practice because it requires<br>having a knowledge of a denominator who<br>don't present to the health system<br>so in practice you might have to use a<br>proxy measure of of testing like um<br>positivity rate to to<br>address that data point a laboratory<br>turnaround time is another<br>key performance indicator and then in<br>public health units there are four<br>important measurements to track<br>the time from the public health unit<br>notification of a case<br>to contact identification and the<br>proportion of all the contacts who are<br>traced<br>then the time from contact<br>identification to quarantine<br>and the proportion of contacts who<br>adhere to quarantine<br>and for each of these you can name a<br>target or a threshold that should be<br>reached<br>and i propose these in my report to the<br>ministry with an overall view that we<br>should be trying to reach<br>trace eighty percent of contacts within<br>three days of the case on set of<br>symptoms<br>and that um overall uh performance<br>indicator is based on<br>on modelling which is limited and<br>obviously this work was done early in<br>the outbreak so i do<br>expect that these should be revised as<br>we have more real-world information<br>but we'll only have real-world<br>information if we measure<br>outcomes so what is the actual public<br>health measure<br>impact of contact racing as opposed to<br>the measures of process that i just<br>described<br>so one that we've proposed as the<br>secondary transmission rate it should be<br>less than one percent<br>so that secondary transmission is from<br>the contacts<br>transmission from them to their contacts<br>so so that's the<br>event that contact racing is trying to<br>prevent and it should be low<br>i've also worked with alex james and<br>others in te puna matani<br>to look at measurements that best<br>correlate with the r naught<br>and from that work this has been<br>proposed the proportion of cases<br>quarantined within four days of<br>quarantine of the index cases could be<br>an alternative<br>indicator but the point is that modeled<br>targets that might be um might be<br>inaccurate they may be excessively<br>strict actually and we should be<br>um looking for real world data to help<br>uh revise those<br>so following my evaluation of the<br>contact tracing<br>system um i recommended<br>a number of changes and especially to<br>expanding our capacity<br>both at a regional and national level<br>and i sought to have a real<br>emphasis on on the exceptional job that<br>public health units<br>do in terms of knowing their communities<br>and being able to<br>initiate an appropriate response at a<br>local level but that they need um back<br>up and uh<br>nationally i also sought to<br>recommend that the preparations be made<br>for further outbreaks including the<br>development of an outbreak plan<br>that would address up to a thousand<br>cases<br>plan for contact racing a thousand cases<br>in their contacts a day<br>and importantly to determine how work<br>would be allocated across the system<br>either to other public health units or<br>to the centre<br>in an outbreak and the protocols that<br>would allow that work to be shifted<br>i argued for stricter supervision of<br>home quarantine<br>and the development of a contact racing<br>act which andrew will talk about<br>and one of the key recommendations was<br>really to try<br>and improve the contact racing<br>information technology systems<br>and the national contact racing national<br>contact close contact service the call<br>center<br>and the ministry had a really good it<br>system and i recommended extending<br>uh that in two directions so firstly to<br>allow public health units to access it<br>so that they could see<br>where um uh work that they referred to<br>another place<br>was at and had in fact be acted on<br>and contacts they hadn't traced were<br>being traced by someone else<br>and secondly upstream to capture those<br>case and laboratory events<br>that have flown effects to the um to<br>the timeliness of contact racing<br>so we now have in new zealand a contact<br>racing<br>action plan that is nationally<br>coordinated and much<br>um and that in itself is an achievement<br>because<br>um previously um it was a devolved<br>system<br>uh the national contact tracing solution<br>so the software is being<br>um is being extended to public health<br>units that's<br>ongoing work and other recommendations<br>about the outbreak preparedness and<br>and so on as being overseen by a<br>ministerial committee<br>excuse me um i won't go into detail of<br>this but before um<br>published um the use of the national<br>contact racing solution allows<br>um uh performance to be monitored in<br>real time<br>however we have very few cases at the<br>moment so um<br>every two weeks the ministry of health<br>is reporting on contact racing<br>performance using the measures that<br>before um concluding i wanted to mention<br>about where we could<br>take where there's still room for<br>further academic work and thought<br>um to assist improvement of our contact<br>racing system<br>and i think understanding the meaning of<br>clusters is a really important part of<br>this<br>so just remembering that although the r<br>naught<br>um for uh covert is 2.5 or two<br>the um uh the most p<br>most cases are in fact zero or one<br>contacts<br>and um that a few<br>will infect two or three and then there<br>is<br>uh rare but important super spreading<br>events which may<br>in fact infect 10 or 20 contacts and so<br>what that<br>means is that there's in fact often<br>greater yield<br>and in the case investigation and<br>finding out how the case was infected<br>uh from um upstream than um<br>necessarily in contact racing though of<br>course you should do both<br>and that process of identifying<br>whether or not you're dealing with a<br>cluster when you find your first case is<br>one that we need to make sure we support<br>better so this report by<br>alan and clark reference down the bottom<br>are pointed to the need for better<br>and it to support cluster identification<br>um but we also need to think about when<br>a<br>public health unit is thinking whether<br>they're potentially<br>on the edge of discovering a cluster<br>what could they do to really get ahead<br>of the curve there<br>one option which would be highly work<br>intensive is to trace second order<br>contacts<br>another might be to think about<br>particular scenarios in advance<br>and think whether short-term targeted<br>restrictions while you determine<br>whether you're dealing with a cluster or<br>not is appropriate so for example if you<br>had one case in<br>a school would you close down the school<br>or<br>similarly in a workplace just for a<br>couple of days to do to do testing<br>so i think that's the next area where we<br>need to optimize the<br>contact racing uh procedures<br>so in conclusion new zealand's contact<br>racing has been<br>uh capacity has been substantially<br>strengthened<br>and we have a national program with the<br>ministry of health coordinating and<br>developing the information technology<br>infrastructure<br>technology has enabled a high level of<br>transparency transparency with reporting<br>of performance which<br>is overall a good thing and has driven a<br>lot of the improvements<br>and there's also been a change towards a<br>preparedness mindset<br>but we can always work to improve the<br>detail<br>with which our preparations are made and<br>that's why i'd particularly like a<br>clusters<br>so um as has been mentioned i'm a public<br>health physician medical officer of<br>health<br>and the clinical director of public<br>health south of the southern district<br>health board<br>so the second part of the talk is really<br>going to look at local perspectives for<br>case management<br>so you'll all be very familiar with our<br>numbers in new zealand these are the<br>numbers as of this morning<br>um but i just wanted to highlight um<br>that there were different incidence<br>rates across new zealand<br>and the southern region was<br>probably the hottest but we had the<br>highest incidence<br>in new zealand and i'll be talking a<br>little bit more about that in a minute<br>you'll also be very familiar with new<br>zealand's approach<br>from our pandemic plan and so we're<br>really focusing on this early<br>recognition case finding contact tracing<br>and isolate<br>isolation part of it um and you'll also<br>note that this new zealand approach for<br>a pandemic plan also aligns with our<br>elimination strategy that we have for<br>covert 19<br>where we have border controls the four<br>pillars of border controls<br>robust case detection and surveillance<br>effective contact<br>um tracing and quarantine and then those<br>strong community support of control<br>measures so physical distancing<br>hygiene coffee etiquette and ppe wearing<br>where<br>appropriate<br>so what happened in southend was<br>that like many of you we were watching<br>what was happening in wuhan in china<br>and from late january we<br>started our imaging infectious disease<br>coordinating committee which was a group<br>across the dhv and we were meeting daily<br>just to monitor the global<br>situation and to watch and see if new<br>zealand was going to be affected<br>um as you all know we were and in<br>southern we got our first<br>cases in mid-march um so at that point<br>the we merged into a technical advisory<br>group<br>we set up an emergency coordinating<br>center and out of that we had various<br>emergency operating centres so one for<br>the public health unit<br>one for hospital level care and one for<br>primary care<br>our public health staff worked across<br>our three offices<br>across the region in dunedin<br>invercargill in queenstown<br>and also working remotely from home<br>during the early phases<br>we were also being asked to support the<br>border response so<br>several of our health protection<br>officers were needing to meet<br>all planes coming in to both our<br>queenstown airport and<br>the occasional international flight that<br>comes into tuning<br>um our operating model evolved but<br>initially we used existing chemical<br>disease protocols<br>that we had used for our recent measles<br>outbreak in fact our measles outbreak<br>really gave us a good<br>dummy run for covet 19. we already had<br>experience in setting up an eoc<br>we had experience in having teams<br>working on the contact<br>um tracing and case detection and so<br>forth so it wasn't<br>a new thing it was just at a much higher<br>level<br>you'll probably also be familiar with<br>this set of graphs looking<br>at across all the dhbs the number of<br>cases and when they came<br>and just highlighting again southern we<br>had a large number of cases 216 in the<br>end<br>but probably more important is that we<br>got most of our cases over an<br>extraordinarily busy<br>three-week period which of course put a<br>huge stretch<br>on our resources um this is a heat map<br>of<br>the distribution of cases and again we<br>had cases<br>all over our very geographically<br>dispersed<br>region with hot spots especially in<br>queenstown dunedin city and number<br>cargill<br>this meant that remote management<br>capability<br>really was absolutely essential we<br>already<br>do most of our work for infectious<br>diseases remotely<br>by telephone so it wasn't a new thing<br>for us but it just does highlight some<br>of the capabilities that you need to<br>make sure<br>are in place for managing outbreaks like<br>these<br>so this is a very simplified diagram of<br>what happened at public health south<br>when we got cases<br>so we had a very close working<br>relationship with southern community<br>labs and quickly set up systems where<br>they would report to us<br>new cases twice a day<br>we used to get an email at 6am<br>at 8 30 we would have a case management<br>allocation meeting where<br>we had the number of new cases we would<br>allocate them out to case managers<br>they would then go off and call the<br>cases<br>what we discovered early on as well was<br>that cases<br>it's often quite a shock to be told<br>you've got<br>covered 19 so we would need to call them<br>give them 15 or 20 minutes to get their<br>heads around that and then call them<br>back to continue<br>the scoping which involved finding out<br>where they'd been who they'd been<br>contact with<br>how big their contact list was likely to<br>be um<br>and it must be pointed out that before<br>lockdown some of our cases had upward of<br>150<br>closed contacts some 90 some<br>30 40. so in the early days it was<br>extraordinarily busy getting those<br>lists of contacts and then finding them<br>all<br>so at 11 a.m each day we would then have<br>a meeting<br>to look um at going through each case so<br>each case was discussed<br>and we would look at the risk clinical<br>risk assessment<br>how many contacts they had and then<br>those cases were allocated onto contact<br>trace leads<br>who would then work further to find get<br>lists<br>of the contacts determine the exposures<br>the context<br>and like aisha pointed out work out if<br>they might be part of a cluster<br>the contacts were then allocated to a<br>contact trace<br>um instructed that they needed to be in<br>quarantine<br>and then daily monitoring with symptom<br>checks was<br>initiated early before we went into<br>lockdown<br>it was very much informing people that<br>they did need to be isolated of course<br>when we went into<br>alert level four this became a lot<br>easier so as i said early on we had<br>large numbers of contacts<br>when everybody was in lockdown apart<br>from essential workers<br>all of our cases really only had the<br>households as closed contact so the<br>numbers were<br>vastly reduced in parallel with that our<br>um<br>cases were handed over to case monitors<br>for<br>daily monitoring and that could be done<br>by telephone or by other<br>it means that i'll describe in a minute<br>so what i.t systems did we use<br>well early in the very early days we<br>were calling each case to the ministry<br>they quickly became<br>overwhelmed with increasing numbers so<br>episode became the single source of<br>truth<br>we would load our cases onto the case<br>report form there and that was what was<br>used for the daily reporting by the<br>ministry<br>we also set up a master spreadsheet for<br>all confirmed and probable cases and<br>we'd use this very successfully during<br>our measles outbreak<br>and on the master spreadsheet would go<br>essential<br>bits of information names nhis onset<br>dates<br>and so forth um the case monitoring<br>could either be done by telephone which<br>was then<br>recorded on another spreadsheet later on<br>we used redcaps that<br>esr had set up for contacts which is an<br>it survey that you can send out by email<br>ask people to fill in<br>the symptoms or whatever that they have<br>that day<br>it's returned and then reviewed by one<br>of our contact tracers or case monitors<br>so contact tracing initially was done by<br>telephone but then we very quickly moved<br>to red caps which was a whole lot more<br>efficient<br>it must be noted as as aisha has already<br>pointed out our i.t<br>systems were not did not interact with<br>each other we're not<br>a large public health unit we didn't<br>have a dedicated i.t system<br>for this so if we needed to find out<br>information about a case or a contact<br>it required looking up multiple sources<br>on our shared drive to find that<br>information<br>um as aisha also referred to there was a<br>rapid appraisal<br>deep dive report so three public health<br>units were selected<br>for a deep dive analysis of our contact<br>tracing<br>and these reports are available for you<br>to read but just the highlights<br>demonstrated what we had to go through<br>in order to get our system<br>very rapidly set up so we had training<br>packages we had documents with roles and<br>responsibilities and instructional<br>guides<br>our training packages were delivered<br>either face to face early on or then<br>later by zoom and on youtube<br>we used a champion system where we had<br>less experienced staff buddied up with<br>more experienced staff and our<br>staff really appreciated this approach<br>however because<br>like i mentioned we had so many cases<br>hit us all at once<br>um this was very difficult to do when<br>our um<br>very experienced staff were totally<br>under the pump and then having to train<br>new people<br>as we went along in the end contact<br>racing training was given to<br>over 135 people a hundred<br>of the staff were actually deployed um<br>and many of uh well some of these were<br>our own health protection officers and<br>health<br>promotion advisors in our public health<br>unit<br>but we do want to do a big thanks to<br>everybody who was involved with<br>us we had staff deployed from across the<br>dhb<br>we had staff from district councils<br>environmental health officers who were<br>also trained and involved<br>we briefly used the services of the<br>national contact racing service in mid<br>to late march but it was a less<br>than optimal experience so we<br>stopped using that until those national<br>systems could get<br>better put in place however there was a<br>very<br>broad view expressed that techno<br>technology could indeed significantly<br>increase<br>our efficiency and we did recognize the<br>value of<br>a national single system<br>so some of the lessons that we learnt<br>during that time was that as case<br>numbers increased so did our need for<br>oversight<br>of daily monitoring of context and<br>especially clinical oversight<br>of our cases new zealand decided early<br>on that all cases that could be<br>managed at home would be managed at home<br>this actually put an enormous strain<br>on our clinical people who were leading<br>that<br>so we only had nurses to do<br>that role because we felt because<br>they were dealing with a new a brand new<br>disease that<br>we were still all learning about<br>that it was um in terms of risk<br>management it was much better to have<br>someone with who had a clinical<br>background<br>to be doing that assessment we also<br>learnt that high risk cases so older age<br>or with comorbidities should be called<br>rather than using electronic responses<br>and this again was so that we could<br>manage that<br>clinical risk and also coupled with that<br>is talking directly with cases<br>we often had helpful family members who<br>wanted to take the burden off<br>their loved one who was unwell but in<br>terms of doing a clinical risk<br>assessment it's much much better to talk<br>so what has happened since then um<br>we all of our cases are um<br>have recovered we had two that very<br>sadly passed away<br>but now the ministry of health as i<br>share indicated is looking forward to<br>what if we have another surge so all the<br>public health units are being asked to<br>develop<br>their capacity uplift plans and<br>following on from aisha's recommendation<br>that new zealand should be prepared to<br>be able to manage a thousand cases a day<br>half of these have been allocated to<br>public health units and half<br>to the ministry central systems<br>so each public health unit depending on<br>your population<br>have had that 500 cases to beat up so<br>for public health south we are being<br>asked to be able to manage<br>up to 34 cases a day<br>should we get an a second surge<br>so we did some modelling the gray line<br>is what actually happened<br>in our outbreak and at our peak over<br>those couple of days we were seeing<br>between 9 to 19 cases per day<br>new cases per day but what we've been<br>asked to plan for is up to 34 cases per<br>day<br>on a more sustained manner and we've<br>been told<br>not to expect that we would necessarily<br>go back into lockdown<br>alert level four um but to plan<br>as if there wouldn't be any lockdown<br>which means that obviously that has an<br>impact on the number of contacts that we<br>might need to<br>be tracing so the national contact<br>tracing<br>solution is described<br>as this integrated system both for case<br>management<br>and tracing cases are loaded into<br>episerv<br>it generates a case into the system um<br>case details are entered following the<br>case scoping i described earlier<br>and then contacts are entered per<br>exposure so this means an event<br>which hopefully would be able to alert<br>us to if there might be a cluster<br>emerging<br>or a household or a workplace and then<br>there's an automated system for the<br>daily monitoring<br>which is similar to red caps but is<br>integrated into the<br>national contact tracing solution with<br>that option to call if we deemed that<br>necessary<br>so in public health health we do plan to<br>use the system if we get more cases<br>we've already had a lot of training from<br>the ministry of health team<br>we've got a couple of super users a data<br>analyst<br>trained and training of all of our staff<br>is now underway for<br>case managers and monitors contact trace<br>leads and contact traces<br>right now because we are not having any<br>cases we're using<br>scenarios to try and maintain<br>competencies<br>now i'm not expecting you to be able to<br>read any of this but i'm just wanting to<br>highlight how complex<br>a case management and contact tracing<br>actually is<br>each of these different colors<br>represents um a different<br>role in that pathway<br>here is where you start when you have a<br>new case reported and then it has to go<br>through all of these systems<br>to properly manage a case and manage<br>their contacts<br>when we've done modeling to look at what<br>daily<br>full-time equivalent staffing would be<br>required to manage this kind of<br>response we've realized we're going to<br>need 127 full-time equivalent to manage<br>it<br>we don't have that number in our public<br>health unit so we'll be looking for<br>staff from across the dhb some community<br>agencies<br>to be deployed to help us with this<br>response<br>um as i said we feel that case managers<br>and monitors must be nursing or have a<br>medical background<br>contact trace leads and staff can be<br>other staff<br>leads can be other staff but it literacy<br>excellent communication skills excellent<br>record keeping skills<br>and that ability to work under pressure<br>are absolutely essential<br>so i'm going to hand it over now to<br>andrew thanks very much susan<br>you might just have to stop sharing<br>hopefully everyone can see that i think<br>that's working<br>uh tina koto qatar uh la mihunui<br>motokorodo thank you very much<br>everyone uh so i'll be talking about<br>some of the digital technologies that<br>we've been considering for contact<br>tracing both in new zealand and around<br>the world<br>um it's important to say that i'm not an<br>epidemiologist or public health expert<br>my background is in computing and ethics<br>and understanding how digital<br>technologies are<br>impacting society and so i think that<br>it's pretty natural for people to look<br>at the world around us<br>and to see how integrated technology is<br>now<br>in our everyday lives and then to look<br>at the manual contact tracing system<br>which is<br>doing the best that it can but it's<br>relying on phone calls and in some cases<br>out of that contact details<br>and it's natural to ask could technology<br>make this better<br>so i think it's important to note the<br>use of it to help support manual contact<br>tracing in terms of the i.t systems that<br>both aisha and susan have talked about<br>but also the potential for digital<br>technology to help improve information<br>collection<br>and get information from people to the<br>right places<br>but before we decide on what technology<br>we should use we need to understand the<br>problem<br>and what the technology is supposed to<br>do i won't spend too much time on this<br>because we've already talked about<br>contact tracing and what it means<br>but effectively you've got a case you<br>get somebody to interview them<br>they can tell you about people that are<br>known to them so family members<br>work colleagues and so on the hard part<br>is when you get to people who are<br>unknown to the patient<br>and you want to be asking questions like<br>where was the patient at what times<br>who else was there at those times what<br>risk of exposure was there for those<br>other people<br>and we might call this completeness as a<br>way of measuring<br>all of the possible context for a<br>particular case<br>the other aspect is that we need to do<br>this identification and isolation as<br>quickly as possible<br>and if we can get people to isolate<br>earlier then the modeling shows that<br>they won't be spreading the disease as<br>much<br>and it means that we can reduce the<br>spread of the disease so we need to act<br>fast<br>and so these two characteristics<br>completeness and speed<br>are really what we want to be targeting<br>with any technical solution that we<br>introduce<br>so now we can look at some of the<br>different technology options um and<br>i think a lot of people have been<br>talking about apps or the app<br>um the app is just software and it needs<br>to get its data from somewhere<br>uh so when we ask the questions like<br>where has the person been at what times<br>and who else has been there<br>effectively that question is one of<br>location tracking um so there's a<br>class of technologies gps wi-fi signals<br>cell tower localization<br>where we're using um signal strength<br>from a device like a smartphone<br>relative to a known point and then we<br>can figure out where they are<br>and i call these high granularity tools<br>because we might be able to determine<br>the location of a person<br>once a minute or once every five minutes<br>and that would give us a relatively<br>high detailed track of where that person<br>has been and who else has also been<br>there<br>the other class is are these qr codes or<br>texting in<br>or using sign-in forms essentially<br>asking where and when did a person check<br>in to a non-point<br>and these would be low granularity<br>because in most cases we'd be finding<br>maybe three to five chickens per person<br>uh interestingly overseas and in the<br>context of this particular pandemic<br>we've seen a lot<br>moving towards this proximity or contact<br>detection so instead of asking where<br>people have been<br>the question is more who have they been<br>close to um so we have protocols like<br>bluetooth<br>and bluetooth low energy or internet of<br>things protocols which are really<br>short range signals and so they're not<br>suitable for location tracking<br>but the idea here is that you can have a<br>device exchange a signal with another<br>device<br>and then you can measure proximity<br>between those two devices based on the<br>signal strength and the time<br>and then we just assume that people are<br>carrying those devices so if the<br>devices are physically proximate then<br>presumably the people are as well<br>another category of technology options<br>to also note is this use of higher tech<br>solutions for investigative surveillance<br>so the use of cctv facial recognition<br>technologies and biometrics<br>and going through financial transaction<br>data conducting virtual interviews<br>these are still mostly manually driven<br>methods but<br>they're using high tech to get high<br>quality information<br>out of these systems beyond just doing<br>so moving on from sort of the technology<br>options i think the the same<br>characteristics of the technology that<br>allow it to achieve<br>completeness and speed unfortunately<br>also allow poor actors to accumulate<br>data and use it for poor purposes and so<br>we need to ensure that the use of<br>technology for the public health<br>response<br>is balanced against protecting the<br>privacy of people we are worried about<br>privacy when we've got the manual<br>contact tracing system<br>but that privacy question is needs to be<br>asked in a different way<br>at a different level when we start to<br>introduce more technology into the<br>picture<br>so we want to be asking what information<br>is being collected we've got some pretty<br>standard stuff in terms of names data<br>phone number etc<br>but when we start to consider also that<br>we're collecting health and symptom data<br>and location logs of where people have<br>been in their timestamps<br>the accumulation of all of this data<br>could be used in really poor ways by<br>poor actors<br>so some other questions that we need to<br>be asking are things like who gets to<br>see that information<br>what purpose is that information being<br>used for governments have been generally<br>pretty good about limiting the use of<br>this information for public health<br>response only<br>but that's the legislative side we need<br>to have appropriate checks and balances<br>and also ensure that there are good data<br>governance and oversight processes as<br>well if we are going to collect this<br>information<br>another important question is around<br>when will this information be destroyed<br>and so most of these systems are<br>deleting location logs after one or two<br>months because they are no longer<br>relevant to<br>contact tracing however some places are<br>keeping anonymized or aggregated data<br>for analysis and research purposes<br>and this is going to be really useful<br>after the fact to understand how the<br>virus spread<br>which communities were most effective<br>and there are a bunch of other policy<br>considerations that we need to take into<br>account beyond just<br>which technology we choose so one of the<br>key ones has been<br>whether the system is going to be<br>voluntary or mandatory most places<br>around the world are using voluntary<br>system which has meant that the uptake<br>rate has been challenging to achieve<br>um so depending on who you talk to and<br>which study you read<br>you need something between 40 and 75 of<br>the population contributing<br>useful data for um a digital contact<br>tracing or automated contact tracing<br>system to be useful<br>and most of the systems that we're<br>seeing now are only achieving about 20<br>to 25<br>uptake you also want to consider whether<br>this is a universal approach or a<br>targeted approach<br>are we trying to deploy this technology<br>to all people in the population<br>or just focusing on those who might be<br>more vulnerable and we also want to be<br>considering things like<br>if we're relying on smartphones as being<br>the primary piece of hardware to<br>that we're going to do contact tracing<br>with then we need to understand who<br>might be left out<br>if we deploy a system um and so<br>it's really common around the world that<br>if we're relying on smartphones then<br>they're going to be elderly populations<br>who don't have smartphones<br>or who don't know how to use smartphones<br>and they actually are the people who are<br>the most vulnerable<br>um to a disease like this so we need to<br>ensure that there are other<br>interventions in place<br>and not just assume that adding<br>technology to content tracing will<br>magically solve everything<br>and of course more data means that we<br>need storage and security as well<br>there's been some debate about storing<br>data locally versus offshore in the<br>cloud<br>this is to do with the fact that data<br>legislation<br>and the jurisdictional effects of where<br>the data is physically<br>located actually matters um even though<br>nowadays we've sort of just seen data<br>all around the world<br>and we also want to ensure that we're<br>encrypting that data both in<br>transmission<br>and at rest and that we're doing<br>independent security orders to make sure<br>that<br>uh this system is not going to be abused<br>by third-party actors who may have poor<br>intentions<br>so i'm just going to go through a couple<br>of case studies of how this technology<br>has been used in different countries<br>and just to show the variety of<br>different approaches<br>so singapore was first off the bat they<br>came out with trace together back in<br>sort of march april<br>uh smartphones exchanged bluetooth<br>signals with each other to record<br>proximity<br>as someone test positive then the<br>ministry of health requests that they<br>give them that proximity data the<br>ministry of health has<br>a database that says<br>these devices are connected to these<br>phone numbers<br>and then contact tracers will manually<br>go out and call people<br>who have had a risk of exposure and<br>advise them on the next steps<br>so they targeted a 75 uptake rate about<br>two months later they only achieved<br>about 25 percent um and<br>to be honest it sort of sounds like that<br>they've given up on this but they can't<br>actually say that<br>because they need to maintain trust in<br>the system uh but they are moving<br>towards using other systems<br>uh recently they announced that they're<br>going to be deploying 300<br>000 wearable bracelets that are<br>compatible with traced together<br>so that they can target specific<br>populations that may not have<br>smartphones<br>australia's copper safe app is based on<br>a similar technology and method<br>um and uh they've been having some<br>similar issues um to singapore<br>in recent weeks singapore's now also<br>released a safe entry<br>so this is a qr code system where people<br>need to go and scan the qr codes<br>it's mandatory for all businesses to<br>display a qr code<br>and some venues are even making it<br>compulsory to scan the qr code<br>before they'll let you in and all of the<br>data in the system is stored centrally<br>so<br>as people are scanning the qr codes that<br>record is being<br>sent to a government server and stored<br>centrally so that it can be analyzed by<br>in poland we have a very different<br>system so<br>they have a mandatory home quarantine<br>app this is to<br>help ensure that people who are supposed<br>to be staying at home<br>are at home and so the phone is using<br>the gps to<br>monitor the location of the phone<br>continuously 24 7<br>um and then users are prompted<br>throughout the day to take a selfie<br>basically to verify that they are with<br>their device and they haven't left the<br>device at home and sneakily gone out<br>um so they will get a notification and<br>then they have 20 minutes to respond to<br>a request to take a photo<br>facial recognition is used to verify<br>that the person holding the phone is the<br>person who should be holding the phone<br>um there's a financial penalty if you<br>don't comply and if you choose to opt<br>out of the system then you get police<br>visits multiple times a day instead<br>they also have a voluntary app for<br>everyone else called protogo safe<br>and so this app has a risk assessment<br>test to help people<br>understand if they are at risk of coping<br>19 or another respiratory illness<br>and also has a health journal to keep<br>help people keep track of symptoms<br>so this is just showing that sometimes<br>you can bundle in other features into<br>these sorts of apps to provide more<br>value to the users and<br>um give them more reason to be<br>participating<br>um and then this app also uses bluetooth<br>proximity detection<br>instead of sending all of that data to<br>the cloud it stores the data on the<br>device for two weeks<br>and the ministry of health can send can<br>provide exposure notifications so it can<br>send data to the apps to say<br>this device is one that has been exposed<br>to covet 19<br>if you if your device has been close to<br>that one<br>then maybe you should get in touch with<br>the public health officials<br>closer to home in new zealand pretty<br>much<br>after level four when we went to level<br>three and two businesses had to keep<br>contact tracing registers that was<br>mandatory there were some notable<br>exceptions such as retail<br>um and effectively initially this was<br>just pen and paper register template<br>that was released by the government<br>of course private developers then came<br>in with qr code systems<br>and this is really to address two things<br>one to help people<br>enter their data more quickly and two to<br>reduce dirty pen risks where<br>everybody's using the same pen and then<br>that pen becomes the vector for<br>transmission of the disease<br>it also helps to reduce some of those<br>privacy risks in comparison to<br>a pen and paper register where<br>everybody's details are out publicly for<br>anybody to see<br>the government then released the<br>intercover tracer app so this is also qr<br>code based<br>and the qr code is generated based on<br>the new zealand business number so it's<br>unique to each specific location<br>the data stays on the device as the<br>government has characterized it as a<br>digital diary for the individual<br>they've then added on the ability for<br>you to electronically share your log of<br>times and places<br>uh to the ministry of health if<br>requested to do so by a contact tracer<br>this is voluntary<br>and then the measure of health can also<br>put push out exposing<br>notifications to say this time this<br>place there was a serious potential for<br>exposure<br>check that against the logs in your app<br>if you were there<br>at that time um you get a notification<br>saying maybe you should go home<br>um maybe get a test uh call healthline<br>if you're concerned<br>i just also wanted to quickly touch on<br>the apple and google protocol because<br>this is getting a lot of traction around<br>the world<br>so apple and google banded together<br>collectively they um the the operating<br>systems that they've developed are<br>account for 98 percent of smartphones<br>around the world so<br>there's real opportunity for<br>interoperability here where you don't<br>need to worry about compatibility issues<br>and interestingly it'll allow for<br>cross-border contact tracing<br>which will be really important if we<br>want to open up the borders again<br>so like many of the other solutions it<br>uses bluetooth handshakes to record<br>proximity<br>um and importantly each government has<br>to develop an<br>app to interpret those signals and<br>provide local information so provide<br>a local phone number but also uh they<br>can<br>tune what is considered to be a close<br>contact um<br>in a way that is relevant for that local<br>context<br>interestingly the privacy restrictions<br>and coordination requirements have been<br>set by apple and google<br>rather than by the governments so<br>they've done things like saying<br>location services must not be used and<br>that governments must only use the data<br>for the public health response and at<br>least at this point there's about three<br>u.s states<br>and switzerland that are adopting it<br>more and more european countries are<br>considering it<br>uh they're having some concerns that<br>using the system means that it's sort of<br>happening autonomously<br>off to the side and that the public<br>health officials aren't quite getting<br>enough information<br>to be able to monitor the spread of the<br>disease<br>i just want to make one final point<br>about usability i think one of the<br>things that we've learned from this<br>experience so far<br>is that particularly when we talk about<br>voluntary systems<br>if it's not simple people won't use it<br>um<br>and i'll sort of have to skip through<br>this i'll just rest on that last point<br>there<br>in terms of integration what i think is<br>that any solution needs to integrate<br>with the manual contact tracing<br>processes<br>if the data that is produced by these<br>systems is not useful or not integrable<br>by contact traces<br>then it will probably just be ignored so<br>we need to be designing these systems<br>in conjunction with public health<br>officials not independently<br>and we want to be keeping in mind that<br>these systems are here to augment rather<br>than replace<br>manual contact tracing where that manual<br>contact tracing is good<br>so just to conclude um i think the<br>theory and logic of<br>using technology for contact tracing is<br>pretty good but as relatively untested<br>in the real world we have very little<br>evidence<br>of effectiveness so far um there is very<br>limited evidence of it being effective<br>before covert 19.<br>um and it's really complicated right<br>because it's not just about<br>choosing a technology option there's a<br>lot of other non-technical<br>considerations<br>the interesting thing will be that um<br>digital content tracing is this big<br>experiment<br>all these different countries have<br>selected different approaches so we'll<br>be able to<br>have a really good idea afterwards of<br>what worked and what didn't work<br>thank you very much and i'll hand back<br>thank you doctors virile jack and chen<br>andersen as we have you at last there's<br>a specific question which comes through<br>particularly for you<br>and do a lot of these systems rely on<br>not just having a smartphone but<br>actually carrying it around<br>is there any evidence of gender<br>differences because it seems to me<br>that men carry their phones more than<br>women<br>yeah there's an interesting point i<br>think uh i haven't seen any analysis by<br>gender<br>most of the analysis has been by income<br>and by<br>age it seems that<br>gender is not sort of statistically<br>significant in terms of determining that<br>one gender or some genders are more<br>likely to carry their phones than others<br>so really the concern is more around<br>young people old people<br>and then poor people effectively<br>thank you this is possibly one for you<br>susan<br>why is the sdhb not using the covert app<br>qr code<br>okay well i think andrew did a good job<br>at highlighting the limitations of that<br>first of all we'd have to need<br>everybody across the district 334 000<br>odd people to all be downloading it and<br>then using it<br>very regularly i think right now because<br>the heat<br>is off um in terms of the number of<br>cases<br>people haven't been you know the<br>motivation to use it is not quite there<br>but as andrew also pointed out really<br>well this would<br>be an adjunct to our normal contact<br>tracing<br>systems we would still be calling people<br>and yes if we could get one or two<br>or a few more contacts through using the<br>app<br>that would be fantastic but right now<br>we're not going to be relying on that<br>okay thank you susan asha<br>i think this one would be probably<br>directed for you<br>in responding to and cooperating with<br>contact tracing efforts<br>a certain amount of trust from the<br>general publish is general public<br>is necessary how was this negotiated and<br>was there a specific approach in this<br>regard for maori what a good question<br>uh yes i agree with the premise that um<br>uh there's a um<br>request to the community to get um<br>information about where<br>they've been and some people may not<br>want to disclose that so<br>a good public health practice requires<br>uh trust<br>um for the contact racing to be<br>effective and<br>um look i can't say there was a specific<br>effort to try and uh achieve that<br>um but i guess i'd point to the efforts<br>made to<br>you know by um officials to<br>explain the process and then um i felt<br>i had a role in trying to flesh out<br>um an explanation for the public uh by<br>the media about what contact racing<br>was as well so that if you were being<br>contact raised that wouldn't be a wholly<br>unexpected or unfamiliar process<br>on one of my slides i mentioned good<br>contact racing is embedded in<br>communities and<br>one of the important things then when i<br>wrote my report was<br>making sure it underscored the<br>importance of public health units as the<br>primary nexus with us is going to happen<br>and not an entirely call center<br>centralized<br>process because in public health units<br>there are numer<br>public health officials have<br>relationships with the<br>with the community they know rest homes<br>from previous outbreaks they<br>um they might have relationships with<br>um uh all parts of the community so i<br>think an emphasis on public health units<br>um helps build that community level<br>trust much more than a centralized<br>system<br>a wholly centralized system would and<br>then i think with respect to a focus on<br>maori i i think as a um overall it would<br>be a fair criticism that that<br>wasn't an emphasis early on but i think<br>the um<br>uh opportunity to think about how<br>in preparing for a new outbreak we would<br>um<br>uh make sure we were responsive to maori<br>would be thinking about things like<br>um rather than um<br>having or firstly having engagement with<br>um maori at the local level uh where<br>public health units are planning future<br>um planning for future outbreaks but<br>secondly<br>potentially working with other maori<br>health providers to<br>train contact races who are working in<br>other health services in the community<br>at the moment and then when there is a<br>surge in cases<br>activating them as contact races so<br>that's um<br>a potential uh aspect thing to look at<br>in the<br>in the future but i agree hasn't been<br>looked at enough now<br>i just wanted to add something um just<br>in terms of other populations that are<br>particularly at risk<br>um so migrant populations um have been<br>groups that have been particularly<br>pointed out as<br>not necessarily willing to participate<br>in contract racing systems<br>uh particularly pacifica and also<br>chinese um and so i believe that<br>ministry of health has been considering<br>how it can do that sort of outreach and<br>that includes things like<br>providing translations for materials and<br>providing uh<br>the indeed copytracer app in different<br>languages and to help educate the public<br>and<br>educate those communities about why they<br>should probably participate in these<br>systems<br>thank you here's a kind of a comment<br>kind of a question which which relates<br>to what you just said<br>i'm interested in the speaker's views on<br>equity issues in relation to the<br>ministry of health's app<br>it seems that many people cannot<br>download it onto their older phones<br>and these are likely to be the most<br>vulnerable<br>yeah and i think this is what i was<br>talking about in terms of whether you<br>want to take a universal approach or a<br>targeted approach<br>i think the ministry of health always<br>knew that their solution was not going<br>to be usable by 100 of the population<br>and i don't think anybody would have<br>thought that it would but<br>the messaging that was given out sort of<br>gave the impression that it would be a<br>universal approach<br>um and so i think that uh what the at<br>least the feedback that i've given to<br>the ministry of health on this is that<br>they need to understand<br>who's missing out um and making sure<br>that there are alternative methods for<br>those people to be captured by the<br>thank way andrew um public health<br>experts<br>blog today calls for consistent and<br>correct use of<br>isolation for people with confirmed<br>infection<br>and quarantine keeping potential contact<br>separate from others with daily checks<br>what would be the benefits and harms of<br>changing the way<br>maybe i can take that one jackie yeah i<br>think this has been a<br>very confusing um thing that's happened<br>not only<br>in new zealand but across the world this<br>interchange between these um<br>using isolation or quarantine i think<br>i guess for pragmatic purposes it just<br>it does mean the same thing it's just<br>that you're doing it for slightly<br>different purposes so you're wanting<br>people to<br>remain in their homes and not to be in<br>contact with other people so<br>yes we could go through and try and<br>educate people on the<br>the final points of the difference but i<br>think the general concept is we want<br>people to<br>stay at home if they've been if they're<br>a case<br>or if they're identified as a close<br>contact and the whole purpose of that<br>is so that we don't have on onward<br>transmission of the disease<br>i should add something i'm going to say<br>i think the ship is sound on that and<br>next year's thesaurus you'll have<br>quarantine and isolation next to each<br>other<br>yes i agree that our opportunity to<br>stand up for proper terminology is<br>probably<br>when i reflect on some of the inability<br>some of the difficulties is being<br>communicating the actual risk<br>um from the lapses in border management<br>and that the actual risk is is very low<br>i mean that relates to this difference<br>doesn't it when<br>the difference between isolating people<br>who are sick and infectious versus<br>people who<br>are at risk of infection and the risk is<br>very low<br>so perhaps if we have been ahead of the<br>curve on that one and um<br>represented the terminology um correctly<br>perhaps people might have grasped that<br>but<br>it's not really something i feel can be<br>well the person who asked the question<br>says great answer so thank you to all of<br>you<br>um one last question how well are the<br>contact tracing apps such as ripple<br>and the government one being integrated<br>and how well are they working<br>andrew yeah so there's a long answer to<br>this um<br>i think the trouble is that basically we<br>don't really know um and there are two<br>key reasons so one is that there's been<br>fragmentation<br>and so we can we can see the statistics<br>for how the intercover tracer app has<br>been performing<br>there's about 10 of the populations<br>downloaded they're<br>sort of 20 000 qr code scans a day<br>but we don't know what's happening with<br>any of these other systems so ripple<br>is not for reporting its statistics<br>daily and<br>a lot of these systems that are<br>decentralized there are no statistics to<br>report<br>um so it's hard to affect to estimate<br>the effectiveness<br>um and then the second part of it is<br>that we're<br>um introducing these systems at a time<br>when our case numbers are dropping<br>and so part of it is the psychology that<br>people aren't really<br>thinking about this or they don't feel<br>like they need to do it<br>but also the ultimate measure of<br>effectiveness is whether it's reducing<br>contact tracing times<br>and when we don't have any cases we<br>can't really measure if it's reducing<br>contact racing time so<br>um at this stage it works in theory<br>um but we'll need to stress test it i<br>think and really<br>do some scenario testing to see if this<br>sort of tool is actually helping or not<br>okay so time will tell thank you very<br>much to<br>all three of you dr aisha virel dr susan<br>jack and dr<br>andrew chen and that's all we're going<br>to be doing today we will be back again<br>tomorrow at 12</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
