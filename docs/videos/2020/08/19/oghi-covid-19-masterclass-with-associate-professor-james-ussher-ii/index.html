presentation<br>set up<br>i'll just remind you that he's an<br>immunologist and clinical microbiologist<br>in the department of microbiology and<br>immunology<br>at the university of otago and<br>and at southern community laboratories<br>his research interests are in applied<br>and molecular immunology<br>medical microbiology and vaccines today<br>james is going to talk about how is a<br>covered 19 vaccine constructed<br>and evaluated james thanks for the<br>introduction<br>jackie and thanks again for the<br>opportunity to<br>come and talk to you so and thank you<br>for joining so today i'm<br>going to focus on<br>take a global view on vaccines<br>for antivirus 2 and try and provide an<br>update to<br>to where things are at and what some of<br>the challenges<br>so miguel has already uh shown this<br>slide but just to make the point that<br>this<br>is um uh something that has emerged uh<br>in december uh last year and uh from<br>there we've gone to over ten and a half<br>million cases and over half a million<br>deaths<br>with virus spreading around the around<br>the world<br>so we we really need vaccines to try and<br>um<br>to try and control the spread of this<br>virus and this virus isn't going to be<br>going anywhere now<br>it's part of the part of the<br>uh it's going to be with you<br>humanity for for many years so we need<br>to find<br>mechanisms antivirals and vaccines to<br>try and manage it so just to highlight<br>the need for a vaccine one of the worst<br>tech countries<br>early on was spain and<br>they conducted a zero survey survey in<br>early may so they looked at for presence<br>of antibodies in the population to try<br>and<br>look at what percentage of the<br>population might have been infected<br>and they found that overall about five<br>percent of those of the population had<br>been<br>uh infected at that same point that had<br>over two and a half<br>to over two hundred thousand cases<br>diagnosed and<br>over 18 000 deaths so you you can<br>imagine that if you're going to multiply<br>that by<br>uh 20 to get through to the whole<br>population<br>being infected that's going to be um<br>cause a lot of<br>heartache and a lot of morbidity and a<br>lot of mortality<br>similarly sweden has taken a different<br>approach to many countries around the<br>world and that they<br>have opted to try and slow the spread of<br>the virus<br>but achieve herd immunity um in a sierra<br>survey that um<br>it was um published in the in the media<br>uh back in um the end of april<br>uh at the point of which they'd had<br>almost three 000 deaths and over 20 000<br>cases suggested that in stockholm where<br>there was the highest rates of infection<br>they still had only uh 7.3<br>of the population uh showed evidence<br>that they'd been infected<br>so again there's uh a long way to go to<br>achieve herd immunity where we estimate<br>you may need<br>depending on the minute on how effective<br>the vaccine is<br>or how effective the immune response is<br>in preventing infection<br>uh needing over 60 or 70 percent of the<br>population to<br>uh to be immune so now sweden has got<br>almost 70<br>as of today sweden's got almost 70 000<br>cases and<br>over 5 000 deaths and if we look at the<br>death rate<br>normalized to population around the<br>globe<br>at the moment based on the diagnosed<br>cases<br>the uk has got the highest rate of<br>mortality rate with 648 deaths per<br>million population<br>and just to put that in perspective that<br>equates to one person and<br>just over 1500 in the entire population<br>who's died to this point<br>uh from sarskoff too similarly new york<br>has got an<br>um a phenomenal rate of infection<br>um and in new york that equates to<br>a phenomenal mortality from this virus<br>and that equates to<br>one in 262 people in new york has died<br>uh from sars coronavirus 2 so<br>this is a major issue and it's<br>not going away so a key question when<br>we're thinking<br>about vaccine development is whether the<br>immune response uh protects against<br>infection<br>and there's been a lot of debate and and<br>twitter sphere and<br>and in the media as to whether people<br>have been uh<br>able to be reinfected with with sars<br>cough too<br>uh at the moment there's no convincing<br>reports that anyone<br>has been reinfected uh this report came<br>out in science uh where they looked at a<br>monkey model<br>so they infected uh rhesus macaques uh<br>with uh<br>sarskoff ii and then re-challenge them<br>so<br>after the original infection those<br>monkeys developed neutralizing<br>antibodies<br>against the against the virus they also<br>developed<br>cellular immunity so they were able to<br>detect both cd4<br>t helper cells and cd8 cytotoxic<br>t killer cells that<br>were<br>specific for the virus so<br>when they initially uh when they they<br>then re-challenged them<br>35 days after the original infection so<br>with primary challenge this is a log<br>scale so we've got the viral load<br>over here and we can see that the<br>monkeys were slow to clear in fiction so<br>this is with a nasal swab and looking at<br>the amount of virus whereas on<br>re-challenge there was very little virus<br>detected<br>in the nasopharynx and that's<br>summed up here so just infection was<br>minimal on our re-challenge most of the<br>monkeys were protected<br>and if we look at the immune response on<br>re-challenge we saw right the<br>researchers saw a rise in the antibodies<br>arise in neutralizing antibodies again<br>log scales<br>and a rise in cellular immune responses<br>against the virus so this suggests that<br>infection<br>does protect against does provide an<br>immune response that protects against<br>re-infection at least at 35 days<br>post-infection<br>however the question remains how durable<br>this protection will be<br>so i presented this slider in previous<br>talk uh when talking about serology<br>but we can detect antibody responses<br>both in asymptomatic and<br>in symptomatic patients this is some<br>data that was published in nature<br>medicine<br>from a chipotle chinese group and<br>but you see a drop in those antibody<br>teters<br>between acute sample which was taken<br>three to four weeks post exposure and a<br>convalescent sample<br>that was taken eight weeks after<br>discharge uh<br>from hospital so we also see a drop in<br>neutralizing antibody teters and<br>in these patients although they do<br>remain detectable and this is just<br>summarized<br>over here so in the acute phase over 80<br>patients had detectable antibody<br>responses uh but that had dropped<br>at least on the asymptomatic uh had<br>dropped to 60<br>uh by um eight weeks after discharge<br>and while it remained higher the levels<br>had dropped in in the symptomatic<br>patients<br>this has been reported before so with<br>the original<br>sars coronavirus which has now been<br>named saskronovirus1 so there was a<br>marked decline in antibody teters after<br>infection with<br>sars coronavirus1 so this is a<br>publication from<br>2007. so four years after<br>the uh after the epidemic uh or the<br>outbreak<br>uh with sars club one and uh again we<br>can see<br>um in blue the percentage that positive<br>antibody drops with time<br>including for neutralizing antibody and<br>if we look at the absolute levels<br>and this is on a log scale for the<br>absolute levels we see a marked decline<br>so whether this is uh<br>still sufficient uh to provide<br>protection against uh<br>and reinfection with saskov one is<br>unknown<br>uh because science club one has stopped<br>circulating um and uh<br>so so it's unknown whether that is uh<br>protective<br>there is further data from um the<br>endemic<br>human coronaviruses um so this is a<br>challenge study that was formed back in<br>1990<br>so they looked here at uh they had 15<br>volunteers who<br>uh were inoculated with this human<br>coronavirus so the endemic human<br>coronaviruses<br>are responsible for between 10 and 30<br>of colds and they were able to<br>so the um of the 15 volunteers who are<br>inoculated um intranasally 10 became<br>infected eight of those became<br>symptomatic developing colds<br>and those who became infected had uh<br>this is looking at the amount of<br>iga or anti antibody that's present<br>mucosal surfaces and nasal washings<br>and the amount of igg that was present<br>in the serum um<br>and those who became infected are in the<br>black dots whereas those who didn't are<br>in the<br>in the open dots and you can see that<br>those who became infected had lower<br>levels of antibody<br>and then it got boosted when upon<br>infection<br>but that with both uh the uninfected and<br>infected<br>it dropped off with time so when they<br>re-challenged them<br>a year later all of those who had<br>previously been uninfected became<br>infected although anyone developed a<br>cold<br>and six of the nine who had been<br>reinfected a year ago<br>who been infected a year ago became<br>reinfected suggesting that<br>uh the duration of protection uh at<br>least<br>against um infection if perhaps not<br>symptoms<br>uh is short um and the duration of<br>shedding was<br>uh lower after re-challenge but that was<br>with a homologous three challenge<br>there's another challenge study where<br>they used a heterologous virus so<br>um from a different isolate and<br>a greater proportion of people who<br>re-challenged became symptomatic<br>this pre-print just came out within the<br>last week<br>so they looked at over 30 years this is<br>a heroic<br>study so they looked over 30 years and<br>10 volunteers and they took blood on a<br>regular basis and they look for<br>rises in antibody that would suggest<br>reinfection<br>and they could show frequent reinfection<br>with the four<br>endemic coronaviruses<br>with a median time between infections<br>overall<br>of 30 months and<br>many infections occurring within 6 to 12<br>months<br>of the original infection so i think<br>this raises<br>serious concerns around certainly and<br>those<br>perhaps have been asymptomatically<br>infected or have had a mild infection<br>how long their immunity may last to<br>to sars cov2<br>so there as far as vaccines for corona<br>viruses go most of the work has been<br>done<br>on the previous<br>zoonotic coronaviruses so sarskov1 and<br>in mers so the original uh<br>papers on sarskov1 there was a<br>flurry of vaccine development and two<br>vaccines made it through to phase one<br>clinical trials by which time the virus<br>had had gone away so<br>the efficacy of those vaccines was never<br>to be uh never able to be tested<br>i mean there was a challenging path to<br>vaccine development and there seemed to<br>be<br>less of a desire to continue developing<br>vaccines because the virus had<br>had gone away so those vaccine<br>development programs were shelved<br>but one of the phase one trials was with<br>an inactivated viral vaccine and it was<br>by cytobac<br>which is a name we'll come back a<br>company's name that we'll come back to<br>um and they showed that they could<br>induce<br>neutralizing antibodies uh with two<br>injections<br>of of that virus uh of their inactivated<br>virus<br>not not at massive levels of<br>neutralizing antibody but they were able<br>to<br>induce neutralizing antibody the other<br>vaccine that was triumphed to phase one<br>clinical trials was a dna vaccine so<br>this is essentially<br>usually a plasmid from bacteria that<br>encodes a gene<br>for the spike protein of the of the sars<br>coronavirus and that gets electroporated<br>so basically they use a special<br>gene gun to try and get it into the<br>cells<br>and you're in the muscle and uh then<br>that produces the antigen and stimulates<br>the immune response<br>and again we can see the different uh<br>these are different uh subjects<br>um there wasn't a great resp response<br>some people didn't respond at all others<br>had an increase in antibody levels not<br>to<br>to massive levels which then declined to<br>the orange bars<br>so it was able to stimulate neutralizing<br>antibodies but<br>they didn't seem to persist and they<br>weren't of<br>of huge teeter there's also<br>been uh this year three publications<br>on another sars oh and another um<br>coronavirus on this case the moose virus<br>so this is a<br>virus that emerged in about 2012 from<br>memory<br>um in the middle east and it seems to be<br>passed from<br>camels uh in into humans on a sporadic<br>basis<br>um so there's been three different uh<br>vaccines that have<br>made it through to phase one trials and<br>one of them is a another dna<br>vaccine and again we can see this is<br>looking at neutralizing antibodies as a<br>phase one<br>trial with a prime and a boost a month<br>apart<br>and i'd have to say pretty disappointing<br>levels of neutralizing antibodies<br>stimulated by that dna vaccine<br>there's also a modified vaccinia virus<br>as a viral vector that's encoding the<br>spike protein<br>in much the same way as the dna virus<br>vaccines do and again this probably<br>stimulates some better immune responses<br>but<br>still only getting up to tetris<br>a about a hundred um and<br>uh they then um then started declining<br>so<br>uh again um able to stimulate antibodies<br>but not uh massive levels<br>and then uh of interest uh there's a<br>publication um from the oxford group who<br>have developed<br>developing a saskov2 vaccine so they've<br>just published their phase one data on<br>their mers<br>vaccine using the same vector<br>and again disappointing<br>levels of neutralizing antibodies<br>stimulated by<br>another important issue that needs to be<br>considered<br>with developing a size cough ii vaccine<br>which has been raised by<br>uh efforts to develop saskov 1<br>and mers vaccines is the risk of<br>vaccine-enhanced disease<br>and this has been reported in some but<br>not all<br>animal models so this is a paper from<br>2011 looking at a an activated size of<br>one<br>vaccine and mice and what they<br>showed uh was that if you vaccinate<br>if you vaccinate aged mice<br>with this double and activated sars<br>vaccine<br>with or without alum as an adjuvant that<br>you<br>get partial protection whereas if you<br>vaccinate young mice you get a good<br>protection so<br>looking here at the uh antibody<br>responses so you get enhanced antibody<br>response<br>if you use um if you use alum uh<br>as a if you don't um and uh<br>and that's against two different targets<br>and it also provides uh protection this<br>looks like it's moved around<br>slightly um apologies for that<br>but the uh this has also been cropped<br>but there's a<br>there's some eosinophils esinophilic uh<br>infiltrate while it also protected<br>partially um<br>against disease um and sorry those<br>graphs have been<br>um cropped by uh from going from a from<br>a mac<br>to a to a pc uh<br>while it also protected against disease<br>partially<br>and better with the alum there was uh<br>still an infiltrate seen in the lungs of<br>the<br>mice that had been vaccinated with the<br>inactivated vaccine<br>uh whether without them or was not and<br>there was infiltrate of<br>sorry yeah here it is up here so the um<br>the eosinophils are<br>seen are seen in the lungs and we can<br>count the eosinophils and we can see<br>that even with the inactivated vaccine<br>on its own there's more eosinophils<br>um and more with the alum uh enhanced<br>with the alum<br>suggesting an allergic type response<br>being being stimulated by the vaccine<br>and indeed if they looked at expression<br>of cytokines that are associated with<br>that<br>th2 allergic response they saw enhanced<br>and il13 and ccl11 which is a chemotaxin<br>that bring<br>brings in uh chemokine that brings it<br>recruits the eosinophils to the<br>uh to into the site of infection uh was<br>seeing<br>uh post infection in animals who had<br>been vaccinated with<br>another form of immunopathology has been<br>reported<br>in non-human primates and this seems to<br>be more antibody dependent rather than<br>mediated by th2 immune responses<br>so this was reported last year<br>in monkeys uh so these are chinese<br>rhesus macaques<br>they were vaccinated with an mva so a<br>viral vector<br>expressing um the spike protein or a<br>control<br>protein and then they were challenged<br>uh four weeks after the boost with sars<br>coronavirus<br>and the vaccine stimulated really good<br>antibody responses<br>um that seemed to persist<br>and these are the the control animals<br>who became who developed an antibody<br>response after<br>they were infected and those it seemed<br>to provide protection against viral<br>replication<br>so in the blue we can see that this is<br>in the nasopharynx suppression of viral<br>infection<br>but there was worse uh pathological<br>changes in the lungs<br>than the monkeys that had received the<br>vaccine<br>prior to had received the vaccine prior<br>to infection<br>looking at day 7 and days 35<br>after after infection<br>and if they gave antibody instead if<br>they gave antibody alone instead of<br>vaccine<br>a couple of days before infection they<br>could replicate<br>those changes in the lungs and it seemed<br>to be<br>due to macrophage activation<br>so these are in the control uh<br>control monkeys so the<br>the macrophages in the lungs were lesser<br>in number and were mainly producing the<br>anti-inflammatory<br>uh cytokine tgf beta whereas in those<br>that had received the<br>antibody prior to infection uh they<br>had more macrophages than mainly<br>produced interleukin<br>6 which is a pro-inflammatory cycle so<br>this has been recognized<br>by a number of vaccine developers led by<br>sepi<br>and there's concern about this with<br>sarskoff<br>ii uh vaccines and<br>they've come up with consensus<br>considerations that need to be taken<br>into account<br>um for vaccine development<br>nonetheless uh<br>a vaccine is desperately required and<br>taking these uh<br>all these things into consideration and<br>the the severity of infection globally<br>at the moment<br>there's a strong desire for rapid<br>deployment of vaccines<br>normally this takes a vaccine<br>development takes a linear process where<br>you've got pre-clinical testing<br>in a variety of animal models it might<br>take<br>five to ten years and then through a<br>series of clinical trials testing<br>safety and then immunogenicity and then<br>protection against infection um and<br>increasing larger groups<br>which can take a number of years and<br>normally it might take 15 years to get a<br>vaccine to market<br>however the strong desire to deliver a<br>vaccine more quickly and<br>with the experience with what happened<br>with vaccine development with ebola<br>uh we've got a compressed uh timeline<br>uh now so uh we're looking uh the<br>the approach that's been taken at the<br>moment is that uh for<br>for many vaccines phase one trials are<br>being conducted<br>simultaneously with this pre-clinical uh<br>testing<br>um and uh then we're seeing simultaneous<br>um conduct of uh phase two and then<br>phase<br>the three trials uh to try and deliver a<br>uh a vaccine candidate uh<br>uh within the sort of 18-month uh time<br>frame<br>or less it should be made the point<br>should be made at the<br>at this point that the earliest quickest<br>vaccine development process in the past<br>was<br>um uh four years for a mumps vaccine so<br>if this is if we manage to pull this off<br>as a global research community this will<br>be an outstanding uh<br>outstanding effort there are a number of<br>vaccines that are<br>vaccine programs that are in a process<br>and a number that are in<br>in clinical development and we've<br>already got 11<br>phase one trials eight phase two uh and<br>three<br>uh uh phase three trials um and these<br>involve a number of different<br>uh technologies and i'll just sort of<br>take you through some of the highlights<br>of that now<br>uh so that the first is an activated uh<br>viral vaccines and uh there's two groups<br>and<br>three groups in china that are pursuing<br>this um<br>and the first publication was in science<br>and this is again cynovac who had worked<br>on the size cog one<br>and they showed that using an alum<br>adjuvant in two doses they were able to<br>stimulate<br>good levels of neutralizing antibodies<br>so by six weeks they're up sort of<br>uh a thousand uh an ec50 of about a<br>thousand<br>which is higher than that they've seen<br>in humans who've recovered<br>from sarskoff to infection and if those<br>if you vaccinate monkeys and then<br>challenge them with the virus<br>there's a good protection with the<br>higher dose<br>against both infection and in the<br>nasopharynx and throat<br>and in the lungs um against against<br>infection<br>and there's no reports of<br>immunopathology which is<br>they've just report they haven't<br>published their phase one or phase two<br>data yet but they just uh there's a news<br>report out saying that it's been<br>uh that it looks promising so no severe<br>adverse events<br>um and they are able to stimulate<br>neutralizing antibodies and over 90<br>percent of<br>patients or volunteers and they're now<br>planning phase three trials in brazil<br>there's also uh sino farm<br>who are working with the wuhan institute<br>of biological products have also got an<br>activated viral vaccine<br>and they haven't published any data yet<br>but there's again press release<br>suggesting that they're getting very<br>high rates of seroconversion with two<br>doses<br>and they've tried various different<br>durations between the doses<br>these are both of these are in not in<br>the highest risk<br>risk populations but they are seeing<br>good<br>they are seeing uh syria conversion<br>another type of vaccine that<br>is progressing through clinical trials a<br>viral victor vaccines<br>so one of these is an adenoviral vector<br>this is using another cold<br>virus a cold virus<br>and this is by can cyno which is another<br>chinese<br>company and they have uh<br>conducted their pha they've published<br>their phase one trial in the lancet<br>and they were able to see neutralizing<br>antibodies although the levels are not<br>particularly high so they up to sort of<br>30 to 40 um uh teeter<br>um sorry here's the neutralizing<br>antibodies here sorry so<br>yeah even less than 30 um and they also<br>were able to show t<br>cell responses as well um but of note uh<br>these are the people who've got<br>pre-existing<br>immunity to add five so add five has got<br>a a<br>is a high rate of zero positivity in the<br>in the community<br>roughly fifty percent of people have<br>pre-existing immunity which might<br>prevent the<br>or hinder the vector from infecting<br>cells and certainly they saw<br>lower cellular immunity in people who<br>had a pre-existing immunity<br>nonetheless they have this was in the<br>news a couple of days ago this has been<br>approved for<br>use in the military and they're also<br>progressing to<br>phase three trials the other uh<br>so trying to get around this issue of<br>pre-existing immunity is using the<br>simian adenoviruses such as the oxford<br>group that's using a chimp adeno<br>so similar to what they used in the<br>emers vaccine and they've published<br>their monkey data and they showed a<br>stimulated<br>neutralizing antibodies but and<br>prevented infection<br>in the lungs but it didn't have any<br>effect on<br>infection in the nasopharynx and they<br>saw<br>protection against pneumonia was against<br>severe pneumonia<br>in in the monkeys um who had been<br>challenged with<br>uh sarskoff too this was a perhaps a<br>slightly<br>uh disappointing uh result um they have<br>uh completed or in the process of<br>completing their phase one two trial<br>there's been no data released<br>yet and they're planning phase two three<br>trial in the uk and<br>into a couple of phase three sites in<br>brazil and south africa<br>and of note there's a pre-print that's<br>just been released um that suggests that<br>maybe you need a second dose<br>of this vaccine to get much better<br>levels of antibodies so they boosted my<br>sand and pigs and and both they saw with<br>if they gave a second dose they saw much<br>better antibody responses<br>there's also dna vaccine candidate from<br>anovio<br>that is is progressing<br>so again they've shown neutralizing<br>antibody<br>responses not at massively high levels<br>on their pre-clinical data and also been<br>able to stimulate<br>good t cell responses as well<br>there's a phase one trial has been<br>results have been announced but not<br>published<br>so not available for analysis yet but<br>they say that they've got<br>immune responses in<br>most of their of their recipients<br>although they don't specify humeral<br>versus cellular<br>and they say that it provided protection<br>and a pre-clinical challenge model<br>and that non-human primate studies are<br>underway but none of that data is<br>available<br>at the moment the other by uh candidate<br>of<br>a viral candidate also vaccine candidate<br>that has uh stimulated great interest<br>are the rna vaccines<br>um so moderna um so moderna<br>so there's been no rna vaccines that<br>ever made it to the clinic yet but there<br>is the suggestion that these uh could be<br>promising for the future so these are<br>like dna vaccines but they're rna<br>encoding<br>the gene of interest usually the spike<br>um and<br>they encapsulated in a lipid<br>nanoparticle to deliver that to the<br>cells<br>and moderna progressed to phase 1 trials<br>in parallel with their<br>their pre-clinical animal data and they<br>announced<br>uh that in preliminary data they saw<br>good neutralizing antibody levels<br>um and eight of their 155 participants<br>and they got a massive investment<br>on the stock market in response to that<br>and they've got<br>phase two trials underway uh there's<br>they've just published some pre-clinical<br>data and it does seem to produce quite<br>good neutralizing<br>uh antibody responses um<br>in uh but it varies between different<br>mouse strains<br>and it did provide protection as well<br>depending on the amount<br>that you gave and they saw importantly<br>saw no enhancement of disease if you had<br>a sub-optimal<br>antibody response and just come out to<br>yesterday or actually today pfizer have<br>got a<br>their own rna vaccine which they're<br>developing with<br>bio in tech and again they've published<br>their phase one two study results and<br>they've shown good<br>neutralizing antibody responses as well<br>there's only uh there's also protein<br>subunit vaccines and i'm just going to<br>talk about nova vacs and sorry i realize<br>this is<br>running slightly over time<br>so they've got a spiked glycoprotein<br>that's in a nanoparticle and they give<br>it with their own proprietary<br>saponin-like<br>adjuvant matrix m and they've shown<br>excellent neutralizing antibody<br>responses and a paper that just came out<br>yesterday<br>in uh neutralizing antibody responses<br>and and mice<br>um and that they were able to provide<br>protection against<br>uh against infection and<br>and mice that were challenged um and<br>that they got greater protection<br>with uh the matrix m adjuvant and with<br>um<br>two doses um and this protected against<br>disease so at the top here are the<br>uh the mice that have been um<br>had the highest dose of um of the<br>vaccine and they were<br>completely protected against disease and<br>they saw no worsening with incomplete<br>immunity<br>and they also saw good uh immunogenicity<br>um baboons as well a non-human primate<br>model<br>so that's now progressing they've<br>already started phase one trial in<br>australia<br>and they're assessing with them without<br>addressing a couple of doses<br>so things are that we've got lots of<br>irons in the fire as it were<br>uh there are lots of vaccines that are<br>um potentially uh<br>being developed and some showing more<br>promise than others<br>um but that having a successful vaccine<br>and phase three clinical trials is only<br>going to be part of the story<br>what's going to be a massive part of the<br>challenge is going to be manufacturing<br>enough vaccine to vaccinate the<br>the world's population this is going to<br>need standing up of a massive number<br>of facilities to manufacture<br>and this can't be done in a linear way<br>either<br>this is being done in parallel with<br>development so many of these<br>companies are investing in upscaling of<br>their manufacturing capacity prior to<br>prior to clinical trial success and<br>we're seeing<br>massive investments in trying to deliver<br>billions of doses of vaccine within the<br>next few years<br>cold chain's also going to be a massive<br>issue for some of these so the<br>rna vaccines need<br>significant need to be stored at very<br>low temperatures which is<br>completely different to the vaccines we<br>have at the moment<br>and is going to challenge our ability to<br>deliver these vaccines<br>so there's great desire to uh for<br>equitable distribution and to try and<br>ensure that<br>there's cooperation around vaccine<br>development and uh recently the<br>eu hosted talks and there was a pledge<br>of money to<br>uh to uh to sepia and to get gaby and to<br>uh to try and um ensure equitable<br>distribution of vaccines however whether<br>this actually occurs in practice<br>uh remains to be seen we've already seen<br>the us government trying to purchase a<br>european<br>vaccine producer cure vac<br>there was uh comments by the<br>indian chief executive of the serum<br>institute of india suggested who are the<br>largest vaccine producers in the world<br>suggesting that<br>most of the vaccines would have to go to<br>their own countrymen before it goes<br>abroad<br>and really the political reality might<br>be that it's going to be very hard for<br>any government<br>to allow vaccine produced in their own<br>country to be exported<br>while there's a major problem at home<br>and as miguel mentioned uh we've uh just<br>in the last day or so we've seen uh the<br>us government purchase up the entire<br>world stock of rendezvous there has to<br>be some concern that this may happen<br>uh with vaccines as well<br>the other challenge that will be uh will<br>present<br>us once we get it is how we actually<br>deliver it who's going to get the first<br>doses does<br>uh how are we how are we going to store<br>these vaccines<br>throughout the vaccine delivery network<br>who's going to administer the vaccine so<br>these are<br>all issues that are going to challenge<br>governments and just to finish with we<br>have seen that the new zealand<br>uh committed to uh allocated 37 million<br>to copy 19 vaccine strategies so<br>part of this is for new zealand uh<br>research and to try and<br>support manufacturing capacity in new<br>zealand to try and contribute to that<br>global upscale<br>of manufacturing they've also<br>contributed to sepi<br>um and to garvey around the equitable<br>distribution<br>and uh really important to see that<br>they've made that<br>commitment to equitable distribution and<br>particularly ensuring our pacific island<br>partners can access a vaccine when<br>needed so<br>apologies for going slightly over um<br>so time for a couple of questions<br>perhaps<br>thanks james perhaps we do just one or<br>two um<br>let's see another enlightening<br>presentation thank you james<br>what are the risks if any of an<br>expedited vaccine process would effect<br>efficacy be an issue<br>yeah so um i i think that<br>it's likely that the first lot of<br>vaccines that<br>become available are not necessarily<br>going to be the<br>best vaccines um they may not<br>be the ones that stimulate the uh<br>strongest immune response or the most<br>durable immune response and that they<br>may require<br>uh boosting down the track so i think<br>that um<br>there's a risk that those first vaccines<br>may not be<br>the best and we've already com there's<br>already a huge commitment to<br>manufacturing<br>uh those vaccines um those protected<br>doses i should say as well might<br>come down if we need to give a booster<br>so you can halve this<br>and synop the estrozenica dose of a<br>number of doses if you need to give a<br>a booster of the um of that chimpano<br>vaccine to stimulate a good immune<br>response<br>there's also i guess increased risk of<br>uh of of the vaccine-mediated immune<br>enhancement<br>if if that is going to occur we haven't<br>seen any good evidence that that's going<br>to occur<br>to date with the sarskoff ii vaccines<br>but<br>there is a risk of missing the less<br>common<br>side effects that might not become<br>evident until<br>vaccines already starting to be to be<br>rolled out so having<br>data vaccine safety monitoring is going<br>to be really important<br>what is the limiting factor in sero<br>conversion will we need to<br>be continually exposed to the virus<br>or is there an option for herd immunity<br>in the long run uh<br>so i think<br>part of the problem it depends on the<br>vaccine<br>platform so some vaccines are just not<br>as good at stimulating<br>antibodies such as the dna vaccines<br>whereas others are<br>much better t cell health is also going<br>to be really important and i think<br>that's<br>increasingly being recognized and while<br>a lot of these early vaccines are<br>focusing on the spike<br>protein there may not be as many<br>t cell epitopes uh for providing um t<br>cell help in in the spike protein<br>uh as there are in other parts of the<br>virus so we may not get such enduring uh<br>such strong<br>neutralizing antibody responses the<br>reality is especially if we look at some<br>of the data from these<br>early vaccine studies is that we<br>are likely to still see circulation of<br>the virus<br>in the community so there probably will<br>be some natural<br>boosting that occurs as well hopefully<br>if people are infected and have partial<br>immunity<br>hopefully uh they have a less severe<br>disease<br>um although we we don't know that today<br>but the animal studies would suggest at<br>least that partial<br>immunity provides partial protection<br>rather than causing enhanced<br>disease so it may be that<br>sub-optimal first vaccines are still<br>good enough<br>and help get us out of our current whole<br>while we try and develop<br>better second generation vaccines for<br>sales golf too<br>so research and development underway<br>right that's all we have time for today<br>thanks once again to both our speakers<br>we will be back for the last installment<br>of the covert 19 masterclass tomorrow</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
