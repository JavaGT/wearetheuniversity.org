concern<br>international relations global security<br>u.s foreign policy great powers and the<br>horn of africa<br>robert will discuss how has covert 19<br>affected the global<br>geopolitical situation robert<br>um my presentation as jackie indicated<br>is on covert 19 the geopolitical context<br>and also what this means for new zealand<br>and i intend to speak for about 20<br>minutes and<br>very happy to take your questions<br>i think there's three key takeaway<br>points<br>firstly kobit 19 is a disruptive<br>event which will redefine the new normal<br>in what has been a prolonged<br>international transition<br>since the end of the cold war in 1989<br>a second takeaway point uh that there<br>will be no return<br>to the pre-globalization era and states<br>sooner or later and sometimes despite<br>themselves<br>will be obliged out of self-interest to<br>extend<br>international cooperation in the future<br>a third takeaway point is that covert 19<br>has consolidated<br>new zealand's status as a minor power<br>often in new zealand we think ourselves<br>of ourselves<br>as a small state and one that is barely<br>relevant<br>to international politics this is simply<br>not true<br>and i think covert 19 has if you like<br>boosted new zealand's presence on the<br>international stage<br>and i think wellington should reset<br>its foreign policy to actively work<br>with like-minded states particularly<br>liberal democracies<br>to strengthen the rules-based<br>international system<br>on which new zealand and these states<br>critically depend<br>so let me permit me to give you a sort<br>of an executive summary uh<br>overview of what i'm going to say the<br>covert 19<br>global pandemic is a disruptive event<br>with geopolitical implications<br>it is reframing the international order<br>as we have known it<br>and that order since the end of the cold<br>war has been<br>torn between the opposing forces<br>of nationalist fragmentation and<br>international cooperation or integration<br>states like new zealand have been<br>have seen their international<br>credibility rise significantly<br>and this could open the door to a new<br>strategy<br>of reinvigorated multilateralism to deal<br>with the ever increasing problems<br>without passports<br>that the late kofi annan spoke of<br>the kovite 19 crisis has confirmed the<br>near breakdown<br>of an international rules-based order<br>that new zealand<br>and a number of other liberal democracy<br>had almost taken for granted even before<br>covert 19<br>the liberal world order which is another<br>way of saying<br>the international rules based order was<br>struggling<br>but the global pandemic has brought its<br>problems<br>to a head cover 19 has highlighted<br>the absence of an effective<br>international crisis management system<br>with the un security council largely<br>marginalized during the global pandemic<br>and this crisis has also revealed that<br>traditional allies<br>of new zealand like the united states<br>and the uk<br>which are both excuse me both currently<br>led by populist governments<br>can no longer be relied upon to provide<br>international leadership in a<br>multilateral setting<br>what should be done the global pandemic<br>is a good time<br>i would argue for new zealand to reset<br>its foreign policy<br>by clearly rejecting the politics of<br>populism<br>isolationism and protectionism<br>wellington<br>should actively champion along with<br>like-minded<br>states and international rules based<br>order as the most realistic approach<br>to global challenges that do not respect<br>borders<br>just a few words on the covet 19 crisis<br>the covert 19 global pandemic is only<br>the latest in a long line<br>of preventable catastrophes and<br>disasters<br>as we know since late november 2019<br>the covert 19 has spread from the<br>chinese city of wuhan to more than<br>180 countries and territories<br>affecting every continent except<br>antarctica<br>to date there has been almost 500 000<br>deaths worldwide from kobit 19 and more<br>than 10 million<br>so let me now talk about the<br>geopolitical context<br>most observers agree that a postcode 19<br>world will be different<br>but beyond that opinion is sharply<br>divided<br>and i what i would like to do is lay out<br>for you two<br>quite diametrically opposed perspectives<br>on the geopolitical environment since<br>covet 19 has affected us<br>on the one hand there are scholars and<br>diplomats who believe the impact of the<br>lockdown responses to covert 19<br>in many nations will reinvigorate<br>nationalism<br>at the expense of globalization which is<br>seen<br>as a project that has failed amongst<br>other things it is<br>argued that the interconnectedness of<br>the contemporary world<br>has exacerbated the medical and economic<br>impact<br>of covert 19 and that nation-states<br>are now pushing back against this trend<br>by strengthening their status<br>as the world's most important and<br>legitimate players<br>now according to this perspective the<br>emerging global order<br>from the time of covert 19 onwards will<br>be characterized by deglobalization<br>and protectionism and by intensified<br>geopolitical competition between the<br>great powers like the united states<br>and china so there's one perspective<br>that the world will become more inward<br>looking and that<br>other problems which do not recognize<br>boundaries such as copa<br>such as climate change attempts to deal<br>with them will be postponed as a result<br>a second perspective is quite different<br>other observers and scholars see<br>globalization as a structural change<br>powered by revolutionary changes in<br>digital and communications technology<br>with these changes beginning<br>in the early 80s according to this<br>perspective<br>globalization has made the world more<br>interconnected<br>and the states will not be able to<br>reverse<br>this trend that is to say you can no<br>more de-globalize than you can<br>de-industrialize<br>it's striking that during the kobit-19<br>crisis the world<br>in the words of anthony elliot<br>at south australian university has<br>quote has the world has witnessed a<br>surge of digital<br>information which is turbocharged<br>virtual<br>networks and the flow of ideas in<br>everything from healthcare<br>to business unquote now according to<br>this view<br>there'll be no return to the<br>pre-globalization<br>era and states confronted by trans<br>boundary<br>challenges that they cannot control will<br>be obliged<br>sooner or later out of self-interest<br>if nothing else to seek much greater<br>international qual or<br>coordination and support in this<br>international transition<br>in other words the impact of cobit 19<br>will uh sensitize states to the fact<br>that there are no unilateral solutions<br>to such to problems like covert 19 and<br>climate change<br>and they will have to make the necessary<br>adjustments and cooperate<br>to try to deal with problems they can't<br>on balance i think the latter<br>perspective<br>appears to be more likely for several<br>reasons that is the view<br>that the world that covert 19 will<br>accelerate globalization rather than<br>stall it why do i believe that<br>firstly i've described coved 19 as a<br>disruptive event<br>if you look at other disruptive events<br>in the past<br>such as industrialization the russian<br>revolution of 1917<br>the end of the cold war all these events<br>led to the emergence of new perspectives<br>daily routines new power relations<br>and indeed new forms of resource<br>distribution<br>secondly the response of states to the<br>kobit 19 pandemic<br>has been very revealing and has<br>highlighted<br>a clear fault line in global politics<br>but this fault line also is important<br>because it gives us some indication<br>i believe of things to come some of the<br>highest death rates from covert 19<br>are found in states with populist<br>governments such as the united states<br>the uk and brazil these states<br>seemed initially indifferent to warnings<br>from the world health organization<br>such as the warning on the 30th of<br>january that coved 19<br>was quote a public health emergency of<br>international concern<br>unquote in addition these governments<br>appeared impervious to the public<br>concerns of many healthcare experts in<br>their respective countries<br>their governments continue to emphasize<br>a sense of national<br>exceptionalism in the face of a virus<br>which didn't respect<br>borders and as a result they were<br>painfully slow<br>to react to the threat as the virus<br>quickly grew<br>as this threat of the virus quickly grew<br>in contrast the nation states that<br>performed<br>relatively well in keeping coved 19<br>related deaths<br>to relatively low levels these countries<br>include south korea taiwan germany<br>singapore hong kong and new zealand<br>what these states have in common is they<br>acted early<br>on the advice of the who the world<br>health organization<br>they consulted with a wide range of<br>scientific<br>and healthcare expertise and they were<br>prepared<br>to learn from each other in the new<br>zealand case for example prime minister<br>jacinda ardern has often referenced the<br>experience of other countries<br>in dealing with this problem not least<br>countries like south korea<br>a third factor which i think tilts us<br>towards the view<br>that cobia 19 will accelerate<br>globalization<br>and make the world even more<br>interconnected<br>is this that many of the problems facing<br>sovereign states not just covid19<br>kobed19<br>is not a one-off and this is an<br>important point to establish<br>many of the problems facing all<br>sovereign states<br>large and small do not recognize borders<br>and cannot be resolved unilaterally<br>here climate change in particular looms<br>large<br>it is unfolding more slowly than kobit<br>19<br>but will have far greater consequences<br>at the same time so just to summarize<br>that point<br>all sovereign states are increasingly<br>confronted<br>by problems which do not respect<br>recognized boundaries<br>and which by definition cannot be<br>resolved on a national basis<br>they have to be resolved on an<br>international basis<br>at the same time the recent global<br>protests<br>in response to the brutal police killing<br>of george floyd<br>in minneapolis indicated that we are<br>witnessing<br>in the 21st century the stirrings and<br>the rise<br>of international civil society in which<br>issues<br>previously considered as domestic issues<br>can quickly become internationalized<br>so these changes then these these<br>factors are some of the reasons<br>why i personally tilt towards the second<br>interpretation<br>that we're going to see a new form<br>of international relations and that the<br>international order<br>is changing in other words there'll be<br>no return to the past<br>it won't be business as normal after<br>covert 19.<br>what does this mean this new<br>geopolitical context<br>what does it mean for new zealand since<br>the end<br>of the second world war new zealand has<br>been a firm supporter<br>of multilateralism and what is known<br>as the liberal international order or<br>the rules-based international order<br>for middle range and relatively small<br>states like<br>new zealand multilateralism they're<br>focused<br>with multi-lecturers and we're talking<br>about the focus on international<br>cooperation<br>and norms associated with it this<br>for small states like new zealand<br>multilateralism<br>offers the prospect of a voice and an<br>influence<br>on international issues that would not<br>otherwise be possible<br>in a self-help state system based<br>largely on power<br>in other words for countries like new<br>zealand indeed the vast majority of<br>countries<br>in the international system rules help<br>to level the landscape and mean the<br>issues<br>are not decided by raw power alone<br>so for a country like ours which does<br>not have the power<br>to make its own rules in the world and<br>determine its own future<br>international rules are very important<br>amongst other things the kobit 19 crisis<br>has highlighted<br>the absence of global leadership with no<br>effective as a no effective crisis<br>management system<br>and in addition not only has there been<br>a lack of global leadership we haven't<br>seen the superpowers the united states<br>and china taking charge and<br>mobilizing international support and<br>solidarity<br>against this virus which makes no<br>distinctions between nations<br>at the same time we've also seen and<br>this has been disquieting to many of us<br>nation states like the united kingdom<br>the united states and brazil<br>seem to be ruled by leaders who<br>apparently put their national pride<br>and political interest above the safety<br>and lives of their own citizens<br>new zealand has a vital stake in<br>defending the rules-based multilateral<br>system<br>against its adversaries but new zealand<br>and other supporters of the liberal<br>order<br>must do more than defend if you like the<br>rules-based status quo<br>they must deepen it so what are the<br>challenges ahead<br>for new zealand in the post covid 19 era<br>for one thing new zealand must link its<br>relatively successful<br>efforts to suppress covert 19<br>with a measured strategy of opening up<br>to the world<br>we've heard a lot of talk in new zealand<br>about we can't really open up to the<br>world<br>until we've got we've completely<br>ended internal transmission of the virus<br>i think the two have to be linked that<br>is to say<br>the principle of linkage means that the<br>music that new zealand should establish<br>diplomatic openings<br>or bubbles to use the the terminology<br>only with states that have performed<br>well in the threat of covid19<br>and states that present<br>a minimal threat to the gains made<br>against the virus<br>in new zealand since late march now this<br>measured approach<br>could generate a trans tasman or<br>even some sort of asia-pacific bubble<br>bubble<br>but it would certainly mean the<br>restrictions on all visitors<br>from states like the united kingdom the<br>u.s and brazil<br>in other words i think as we continue<br>to do well against covert 19 in new<br>zealand<br>we should be looking to open up but<br>gradually and selectively with those<br>states which have<br>also performed well in dealing with this<br>crisis<br>and we should be very wary of opening<br>this country's commercial and diplomatic<br>links with countries like the united<br>kingdom the us<br>and brazil which haven't really followed<br>best practice<br>and haven't always listened to the<br>advice given by the who<br>a couple other points i would like to<br>mention before finishing<br>credible global leadership is not going<br>to be established<br>until there is a more effective<br>international machinery for dealing with<br>such problems<br>as hovid19 as i mentioned in my opening<br>remarks<br>the u.n security council has<br>failed to take the initiative with<br>response to this crisis<br>the u.n security council clearly needs<br>to be reformed<br>at present the permanent members of the<br>security council known as the p5 group<br>have the privilege of being able to veto<br>any un<br>security council resolution they do not<br>like<br>the brutal nine-year civil war in syria<br>is a sad reminder<br>that the use of the veto has made the<br>u.n security council<br>incapable of delivering either stability<br>or justice<br>to places that are in desperate need of<br>it and as i mentioned in the book with<br>professor lloyd davis in 2015<br>which was on the subject of science<br>diplomacy the veto power<br>of the p5 group should be abolished<br>or severely circumscribed to enable<br>more effective prop responses to global<br>pandemics like covet 19<br>third it's time for a serious<br>international debate<br>on how the liberal internet economic<br>system<br>can be made to work better for more<br>people kovid 19<br>has starkly revealed some really<br>um tremendous inequalities both within<br>countries and across countries<br>while there may be little consensus<br>about what a reformed<br>liberal economic order might look like<br>the current situation where 26<br>billionaires<br>have as much wealth as half the world's<br>population<br>is not morally acceptable or politically<br>sustainable going into the future so let<br>me summarize my remarks<br>above all the kovit-19 crisis has<br>demonstrated to new zealand and many<br>other states<br>that neither the united states or china<br>can be relied upon<br>to protect their vital interests<br>in an interconnected world at a time of<br>a global pandemic like covert 19.<br>in the circumstances new zealand and<br>other small<br>states and middle level powers will have<br>to<br>move out of their comfort zone and<br>accept the challenge of moving away<br>from what might be described as top-down<br>multilateralism<br>where many states like new zealand look<br>to superpowers<br>like america or china to lead<br>they must move from that reflex to a<br>more bottom-up<br>proactive strategic form of<br>multilateralism<br>that is capable of mobilizing<br>international support<br>for long overdue institutional reforms<br>and also<br>strengthening the international<br>rules-based order<br>in which they have a vital stake in<br>other words<br>new zealand's foreign policy reset<br>following this crisis<br>involves a willingness to combine with<br>like-minded countries<br>to develop the international machinery<br>so that we can<br>more effectively deal with challenges<br>which do not like over 19<br>and climate change which do not<br>recognize<br>national boundaries thank you very much<br>and thank you robert for most for<br>provoking talk<br>we have a few questions that have come<br>through firstly what is your view<br>on the u.s terminating its relationship<br>with the world health organization<br>during the pandemic<br>will this leave a power vacuum in the<br>organization and how will it directly<br>affect countries like new zealand<br>it's a very good question and it's<br>ironic because the who was<br>warning the the trump administration<br>from late january onwards<br>about covert 19 but many of those<br>warnings were disregarded<br>um as right through to about march the<br>17th the trump administration<br>was maintaining that covert 19 was a<br>problem that had been exaggerated and<br>would disappear<br>sometime in april so the interesting<br>thing is<br>that the trump administration is has<br>removed itself from the body which was<br>actually warning the united states<br>on the actions it should have taken much<br>earlier<br>it clearly weakens the w.h.o but i think<br>it's incumbent<br>on the rest of the international<br>community<br>to fill the financial shortfall<br>that's been caused by america<br>withdrawing from it and by the way<br>mr trump's actions are not widely<br>supported in the united states<br>there are lots of critics not least in<br>the republican party<br>of what mr trump has done so i think<br>it's important<br>in the interim that other countries uh<br>perhaps the eu<br>china and the uh middle range countries<br>such as australia<br>canada new zealand combine their efforts<br>to make sure that the who<br>is not handicapped by this withdrawal of<br>u.s support<br>thank you can you explain why the u.n<br>security council was not able to work<br>with the world health organization<br>during the pandemic<br>yes well the you know we often think of<br>the un security council as being an<br>entity<br>in itself it's not it's only as strong<br>or as<br>weak as its members allow it to be<br>and there are five members on the<br>security<br>permanent members of the security<br>council these are the ones that call the<br>shots they are<br>china russia the united states britain<br>and france and there are<br>with the exception of perhaps france and<br>china at least three of the permanent<br>five<br>were skeptical about international<br>institutions like the who<br>so that's probably one of the factors<br>why<br>um the u.n security council was not as<br>supportive as it could have been and<br>worked closely as it could have done<br>with the w.h.o um you know<br>in a sense to answer your question very<br>concisely<br>i think great power politics played a<br>role<br>in uh blurring or impeding cooperation<br>between the who and the u.n security<br>council<br>you i'm sure some more questions will<br>come through<br>soon we haven't had any yet um but<br>perhaps while we're waiting for people<br>to formulate their questions<br>are there any other insights you may<br>want to share robert that you didn't get<br>to cover during your talk<br>not to put you on the spot but um<br>anything else you'd like to add<br>well the only thing i'd like to develop<br>a little bit is that<br>i think um clearly this has been<br>a very difficult period for many people<br>but i think<br>in a sense what we're seeing is a<br>remarkable change<br>um in global politics and uh i think<br>one of the ironies of the present<br>situation we've seen china and russia<br>used covet 19 as a reason<br>to intensify their rivalry but let's<br>think about this<br>they're intensifying their rivalry over<br>an issue neither of them can control<br>and i think that points to a significant<br>insight for the future<br>is that we are as i said in my<br>presentation we are confronted with the<br>problems<br>that we cannot control and i think this<br>will pay that is to say there is no<br>unilateral<br>solution to covert 19. um<br>and so i think that is putting a<br>tremendous onus now<br>on perhaps the silent majority the<br>number of states in the international<br>system<br>which um have tended to defer to the<br>great powers<br>if you read our media you often would<br>think that great powers run the world<br>well they would certainly like to<br>but we live in the world in the 21st<br>century where more great powers<br>are more vulnerable and more<br>interconnected than ever before<br>but that does the good news is that<br>gives an opportunity<br>for the smaller powers to exercise much<br>greater influence<br>but it's one thing to have the<br>opportunity you also<br>have to take the opportunity that is now<br>available and i think<br>there is i think jacinda ardern has<br>shown with her leadership<br>uh during the globe in 19 crisis<br>uh and also immediately after the<br>christchurch atrocity last year<br>in march last year when 51 people<br>tragically lost their lives<br>through an act of terrorism i think<br>jacinda ardern's<br>contribution has been highly evaluated<br>internationally a number of people<br>who based in new zealand have had this<br>experience when dealing with<br>international colleagues<br>people express their admiration of how<br>this country is performed<br>and i think many people in the world<br>would like to see greater input<br>from countries like new zealand on key<br>international issues<br>which affect everyone i hope we are in a<br>position<br>to make that contribution thank you<br>can you comment on the potential to<br>direct economic resources<br>designed to mitigate the downturn in our<br>economy towards investment in climate<br>change mitigation<br>yes well first of all we have to<br>recognize that<br>there is a climate change crisis and<br>you know until we get a consent a<br>political consensus<br>both domestically and internationally on<br>this issue<br>then the issue that's been raised cannot<br>be effectively<br>tackled um it's clearly<br>uh if we have international agreement<br>remember<br>the united states withdrew from the<br>paris accord on climate change<br>in 2017 which has weakened that<br>agreement<br>hasn't hasn't killed it but it's<br>weakened it um<br>yes i mean this is we have some tough<br>questions ahead<br>and um but i i would say recognition<br>that this is a major problem<br>uh clearly climate change in the long<br>term cannot be tackled until we move to<br>an alternative<br>energy paradigm so the allocation of<br>economic resources towards that<br>is going to be i i suspect quite a<br>divisive issue<br>but an important one and climate change<br>is if you if you like another<br>illustration<br>of what we're seeing with kovind 19 a<br>problem which does not recognize<br>uh national boundaries and which by<br>definition<br>can only be resolved on a global basis<br>so yes we do need to lead by example<br>we do need to be seeing that we're doing<br>our bit internationally<br>to conform with the paris uh<br>accord on climate change but i think we<br>do need<br>more impetus internationally and<br>uh in short we need to recognize there<br>is a major crisis<br>this is the biggest threat facing human<br>life<br>on earth in the foreseeable future so we<br>thank with robert we're out of time but<br>we still have a few questions to go<br>and perhaps while we're getting our<br>second speaker set up<br>we might continue to run through the<br>questions sure um<br>bear in mind that there may be a slight<br>noise in the background while we're<br>getting our second presentation set up<br>but let's continue the questions until<br>until our speaker is<br>is set up i'm hoping that our technician<br>will be able to to help with that so<br>bear with us if there's a little bit of<br>a<br>disruption but we'll continue with one<br>or two questions for robert until the<br>other presentation is really robert do<br>you have any comments on how the<br>pandemic might affect<br>upcoming elections uh with election<br>i'm not sure my predictions are better<br>than anyone else's i mean somebody once<br>said a week is a long time in politics<br>so<br>politics is a volatile business um i<br>would say<br>that if you look at the united states i<br>think<br>mr trump's political base of support is<br>being eroded<br>by the rapidly rising number of deaths<br>and<br>mr trump continues he has persisted with<br>the idea<br>the notion that everything was under<br>control<br>that clearly is not the case and with<br>122 000 deaths and rising<br>i think whatever a government says about<br>his performance<br>those number of deaths prevent an<br>inconvenient reality<br>that the person running for office has<br>to deal with<br>so i would not be surprised if covert 19<br>has actually<br>made a significant intervention in<br>american politics<br>in new zealand um very difficult to<br>predict<br>we've seen the major opposition party<br>have just changed<br>their leadership they seem to be getting<br>a bit of a bounce from that<br>but um i think there's widespread<br>international and certainly national<br>admiration for jacinda ardern's<br>leadership<br>and i think logically one would expect<br>the<br>incumbent labour-led government to get<br>some<br>uh bounce from that performance but uh<br>it as i say a lot can happen between now<br>and september in the new zealand case i<br>i hesitate to say more than<br>on the face of it jacinda adern should<br>benefit<br>politically from her uh very i think it<br>was<br>outstanding leadership it was a<br>combination of compassion<br>but also a willingness to take decisive<br>action with quite an early lockdown<br>which won the support of people both<br>from her<br>own support base in the labour party but<br>a lot of people<br>who identify themselves as national<br>supporters also admired that combination<br>of compassion but decisive action as<br>well<br>a lot of food for thought there thank<br>you our next speaker and thanks once<br>again to professor patman for being here<br>today</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
