primary research interest<br>involves the causes of cancer<br>this presentation will focus on what is<br>the r value<br>and why is it relevant to understanding<br>covered 19.<br>brian right how do i look at that that's<br>the slide that they're seeing isn't it<br>right thanks i can take that on well<br>welcome everybody<br>i'm going to start with a first of all<br>socrates said knowledge is opinion with<br>evidence<br>when the evidence changes the opinion<br>doesn't all you've got is dogma<br>then dogma is the worst thing that you<br>can<br>inflict on people as a teacher so<br>that's my first thing because i always<br>start historically attend to anyway just<br>to show you<br>actually there's been a lot of thought<br>about all this sort of stuff for quite<br>some time<br>and it all sounds very new now but it's<br>actually been around for a while<br>so i just put those two uh<br>pieces of information up you'll notice<br>that daniel bernoulli<br>who really was the founder of the<br>binomial distribution<br>uh was a physician initially<br>now our error is the thing<br>there can be irritation it can also be<br>uh un being unsure anyway ah naught<br>is the basic reproduction number it's uh<br>it's sometimes called basic reproduction<br>ratio<br>it's used to measure the transmission<br>potential of a disease<br>and sometimes mislabeled is it called a<br>rate when it's not a rate it's got no<br>particular units at all<br>it's the average number of secondary<br>infections that are produced<br>by a typical case of an infection in the<br>population<br>where everyone is susceptible so that's<br>our naught<br>that's why it's north it's sort of like<br>at the beginning if you like when<br>everybody's considered to be<br>susceptible and for measles it's quite<br>high<br>and it also is just the<br>cases that it produces immediately not<br>the secondary cases not the cases that<br>those cases then infect so<br>um it's it's a state where there's no<br>uh nobody's uh immunized or<br>and uh the australian department helped<br>make it a little fairer by saying it's<br>it's uh in the absence of any<br>intervention<br>so it's not a biological constant of the<br>pathogen or the<br>disease it's affected by other factors<br>in the<br>such as environmental conditions and the<br>behavior of the infected population<br>so you can expect it to if you have<br>different groups of people<br>it will differ in those different groups<br>we'll get back to that a little later if<br>i remember<br>to just talk about briefly about meat<br>works and uh<br>and rest homes<br>now it can be calculated different ways<br>uh various assumptions are needed to<br>actually<br>make calculation the problem with um<br>mathematics<br>to some extent is statistics is we tend<br>to talk in terms of averages<br>and the average person well there's no<br>such thing as the average person<br>i've never met anybody who's half female<br>and half male yet<br>so it doesn't quite work all the time<br>anyway in terms of trying to get a some<br>sort of description about what's going<br>on we we tend to use<br>to the idea of averages<br>and so in the homogenous mixing<br>population<br>it's where i've got as much chance of<br>bumping into you in wellington<br>as i have as the person down the street<br>in dunedin in the next<br>hour which obviously is not the case so<br>so the uh the mixing in the in the<br>population<br>is very often not that<br>though however within a confined space<br>like a prison or rest home<br>then you can consider the mixing of<br>those people to be<br>relatively homogeneous especially if<br>they all sit down for lunch around the<br>same<br>tea room for example so<br>there are instances when you can sort of<br>assume<br>homogeneous mixing but in general in<br>terms of population at large<br>we talk about heterogeneous mixing of<br>populations<br>we have to take that into account when<br>we're doing any sort of modeling<br>of the disease so at that point<br>um the simple equation at the top it no<br>there's several things that influence<br>the reproductive number<br>the um rate of contacts<br>with susceptibles and the host<br>population it's not<br>if infected is how much people actually<br>interact with each other per unit time<br>the probability of infection being<br>transmitted during contact which is also<br>a combination of the<br>agent's transmission of the agent which<br>may be the agent itself<br>or the mechanism object or whatever else<br>that is involved in the transmission and<br>also the host susceptibility of the<br>infection<br>becoming established is one thing for me<br>to get the virus is another thing for<br>the virus to multiply within me and<br>cause disease<br>they're actually separate issues<br>there's also the duration of<br>infectiousness<br>but infectiousness can change over time<br>as well<br>even within the period that someone's<br>infectious<br>so for example in covet 19 people are<br>much more<br>infectious when they're coughing and<br>sneezing and have symptoms<br>then in the two days prior though<br>they're still infectious<br>within two days fire prior in fact<br>in that asymptomatic phase<br>people are most infectious 0.7<br>of a day before they get symptoms<br>so that means that contacts within the<br>two days prior to the person getting<br>the direction of infectiousness and that<br>can vary<br>by the time since<br>people are infected you're not<br>necessarily when i'm when if i was<br>infected as i<br>said before people when they've got<br>symptoms and are coughing and sneezing<br>are much more infectious<br>than prior to that even though they may<br>be have some infectious<br>so in general the whole idea is the<br>susceptible<br>um in the susceptible population are not<br>must be greater than zero<br>i say in general because there are some<br>funny exceptions or circumstances<br>whether it doesn't actually apply quite<br>as<br>rigorously or as legitimately as<br>many circumstances not all contacts will<br>be susceptible to infection<br>but we'll get to that a little later<br>these are typical values of r now<br>because uh depends on the environment et<br>cetera<br>it actually differs for each outbreak of<br>these different diseases but in general<br>they're in this sort of range<br>so i'm putting up typical values of r in<br>in terms of the range um we've got<br>and the different forms of spread<br>aerosol spread you'll notice has<br>we get down to the issue of droplets<br>which is really sars for example the<br>common cold and covert 19<br>and you'll see covered 19 there are<br>estimates of r for this<br>this particular table that i took out of<br>the literature<br>of 1.94 to 5.7 which is quite a range<br>but important<br>and you'll see it's droplets later i'll<br>go on<br>i might mention the issue of droplets a<br>little more a little later on<br>when we get into more detail<br>now you've heard about the herd immunity<br>threshold herd music muzzle<br>put this in this is a simple equation<br>that gives you an idea of<br>the threshold at which herd immunity<br>kicks in now is the proportion of<br>people who have to be immune or<br>recovered<br>reducing the incidence to die away if<br>you like<br>so for example for for<br>covert if it's in fact uh around an<br>arnold of five<br>then that would mean 80 of the<br>population would have to be affected<br>before you start having any herd<br>immunity<br>if it's only two then 50 of population<br>would have to<br>have the<br>infection or being infected and become<br>immune<br>for their to be heard immunity<br>there's a lot of people i've been people<br>in new zealand that's two and a half<br>million people<br>and if uh we have a mortality rate of<br>one percent<br>it's uh was it 25 000 deaths<br>i mean so it can be relevant<br>uh that's uh a little simplistic in the<br>sense it appears that<br>younger people are much less likely to<br>die of it than<br>older people the basic<br>reproduction number is not to be<br>confused with the effective reproduction<br>number<br>which is sometimes a little bit more<br>useful in terms of<br>managing things on the week day-to-day<br>week to week month by month basis<br>so for the effective reproductive<br>number the uh whether someone's infected<br>or unaffected<br>is is is not relevant so it becomes<br>uh the average number of cases a<br>typically<br>typical effective person generates in<br>the current state of the population<br>which does not have to be an uninfected<br>state<br>and it's you can calculate as a<br>proportion of the r naught<br>in terms of the fraction of the host<br>to eliminate the disease from population<br>art generally needs to be less than one<br>is that less than one that the one thing<br>is what's useful in terms of<br>assessing how you're getting on<br>rt is sometimes it's possible to<br>actually calculate<br>uh our effective reproduction<br>ratio during the as you mix<br>panning out of those and that helps to<br>measure<br>how effective some of your control<br>mechanisms<br>the whole idea of ours to is an attempt<br>to capture the concept that if people<br>recover and become immune faster than<br>people are affected<br>to get it the r value often needs some<br>sort of model<br>especially when you've got heterogeneous<br>mixing of the population<br>uh models are only as good as<br>assumptions that<br>it's easy to think of them as some sort<br>of black box that gives you answers<br>well it doesn't really it gives you<br>some answers that are all relative to<br>all the assumptions in it<br>the thing about models is there's often<br>a huge number of assumptions in them<br>and their advantages you can cope with<br>you can put them in a model when you<br>can't actually manage all these<br>assumptions and you hear it all at the<br>same time in their relationships to each<br>other<br>often uh nor can't actually be<br>calculated<br>absolutely you end up with a a measure<br>which is a sort of threshold<br>rather than exactly what you'd like it<br>to be but it's typical modeling anyway<br>there are typical simple sir<br>epidemic curves basically susceptible is<br>this the infective desire and the<br>recovereds<br>are and over time susceptibles<br>some of them get infected in this case<br>all of them get infected<br>um and some of the infected and<br>just about all the infected recover you<br>left at the end of<br>in this case a time of 100 let's say 100<br>days you end up with<br>a small proportion of people are still<br>being<br>if and you hope it doesn't<br>get into any endemic state so that all<br>the cesipoles receptors go right down to<br>zero<br>in which case the infection dies out now<br>this epidemic curve which is the eye the<br>red curve<br>is it's a typical sort of epidemic<br>epidemic curve<br>but it assumes all sorts of things<br>assumes heterogeneous mixing<br>assumes a very continuous uh<br>ability of the virus to spread quite<br>easily<br>very very uh typical of aerosol spread<br>such as<br>something like measles or whatever now<br>within a particular group of people as i<br>said before<br>you may get a very simple uh<br>epidemic curve like this within the sort<br>of population group<br>within a cluster for example you'll get<br>this sort of pattern<br>occurring<br>you can actually work it out also as a<br>ratio<br>of the the<br>transmission rate times the mean<br>infectious period<br>which you the model generates also some<br>issues if you have a disease<br>there's different latency periods you've<br>got to then do something a little bit<br>special and that occurs with<br>tuberculosis when you're modeling<br>tuberculosis for example<br>now there are many there's different<br>types of epidemics<br>it's important whatever model you use<br>fits the epidemic<br>the type of epidemic point source<br>epidemic where someone<br>uh is infected and affects other people<br>that's fairly straightforward i showed<br>you the curve for that before<br>for continuous source where this person<br>infects another person and then they<br>infect a whole lot of other people<br>you get a more sort of broader curve if<br>you like<br>with little bumps and blips along the<br>way where you get different groups of<br>people<br>if you like small clusters occur a<br>propagated source<br>uh one person infects a group of other<br>people<br>after a period of time and then they<br>then<br>fix and jumps from them to some other<br>group of people<br>and you see you get these clusters so<br>the propagated source epidemic there is<br>very sim<br>is the cluster based epidemic<br>often with clusters you can't actually<br>work out how<br>someone in one infected cluster if you<br>like<br>it's managed to infect someone from<br>another cluster<br>often the other group doesn't seem to be<br>related to the first group at all<br>and so you end up with a lot of clusters<br>with unknown source<br>and you'll see that in new zealand data<br>of the bigger clusters that have been<br>uh listed so this is the sort of<br>john holmes kindly gave me this public<br>health physician done eden<br>um and so these are the different cases<br>that have occurred<br>uh you end up with a red group person<br>one it affects three people<br>person two manages to affect<br>another person five and so on and you<br>get this sort of<br>building up what's important is the link<br>between 20 to question mark<br>dot dot dot dot there's another cluster<br>starts at question mark<br>but you have no idea how they got<br>infected<br>it's typical clusters and that's<br>and it means that assuming some sort of<br>continuous distribution of the spread of<br>disease through the population<br>doesn't work very well at all<br>and so you have to take a different<br>approach<br>over time you get different jumps the<br>second bump<br>there is several clusters<br>that have come out of<br>the first cluster which was after the<br>index case<br>if you then fit a continuous<br>distribution through that you get<br>a bit of a mess actually and you try to<br>extrapolate back<br>to the beginning or back to the further<br>out to the end<br>you it's not very accurate at all<br>in fact cluster epidemics stop suddenly<br>they don't tail off<br>they stop they stop because there's no<br>longer transmission in general<br>population and all the clusters are<br>closed off<br>and in quarantine suddenly the epidemic<br>stops bingo<br>and that's sort of what's happened in<br>new zealand<br>similarly you can have a small group of<br>cases that start<br>that you may may appear like in italy<br>they had three cases on one day<br>but nothing for three weeks afterwards<br>it appears those three cases came in and<br>if you like<br>resolved without actually transmitting<br>the disease at all<br>there was another lot that came in that<br>actually started the epidemic<br>so it can be very hard to determine when<br>they<br>epidemic that went through the<br>population when it started and from<br>where<br>if you do a continuous distribution to<br>that you'll<br>then pretend or it will then suggest to<br>you there was a whole load of disease<br>before the first little group of three<br>cases<br>where there was a whole load of disease<br>between the first three and the ones<br>that occurred three weeks later<br>when in fact it wasn't until because<br>it's a cluster-based epidemic<br>in cluster-based epidemics there's very<br>very little transmission<br>between people in the general population<br>the disease just jumps from one cluster<br>requires our within clusters to be<br>considered separately from<br>our outside of clusters transition rate<br>and covered<br>outside of clusters in new zealand was<br>very very low<br>and because it was very low lockdown was<br>able<br>enabled us to isolate the clusters that<br>we had<br>and control them in which case there's<br>no longer any jumping<br>or very little possible from one cluster<br>and we were able to novel this disease<br>completely<br>providing we don't get any new<br>introductions<br>but we should be able to contain those<br>as well but a lot of people have thought<br>that in the first place with this<br>disease<br>and it didn't quite work out that way<br>did it<br>so that's my<br>piece if you like the issue<br>there is an issue at droplet size i i'm<br>going to propose right here and now that<br>i suspect that<br>for covert you actually need quite big<br>droplets<br>have considerably high risk<br>of transmission once it's within the<br>workforce<br>people say it's because people working<br>alongside each other well actually yeah<br>that's true too but there's a lot of<br>industries where people work alongside<br>each other they don't work in a damp<br>environment with droplets after all this<br>disease<br>started in a meat market fish market<br>wuhan<br>i don't think it's coincidence however<br>that's my speculation and we'll see what<br>happens<br>that's that's that's the approach<br>that i take in terms of r and uh<br>it's important that whatever talk you<br>have<br>generates more questions than you had to<br>start then you started with<br>because that enables some good learning<br>stifle any questions at all keep an open<br>mind<br>about everything thank you<br>thank you associate professor brian cox<br>and uh there are certainly questions<br>coming in in the name of this thing<br>first one being can you comment on how<br>face masks<br>impacts the r number or zero entries i<br>can't tell you<br>exactly how that impacts it or whether<br>it impacts it at all<br>um certainly if there's no transmission<br>in general population<br>face mass not gonna do anything is it<br>because you're not<br>protecting yourself from anything or<br>you're not infected either<br>and can't really transmit it so<br>at the current point in time i don't<br>think face masks<br>are particularly relevant actually<br>except for those that are looking after<br>people who have covered<br>or people in quarantine<br>there are certain situations where that<br>may be<br>helpful i'm a bit concerned that it's a<br>nice damp environment if you don't<br>change your<br>face mask very frequently it's also an<br>excuse to put your hands near your mouth<br>or your nose um and i go back to this<br>whole idea about<br>large droplets large droplets fall out<br>and therefore your two meter rule for<br>distancing<br>work a lot better than<br>some other diseases so face mass to me<br>is still a mixed bag<br>and at the moment because we have no<br>community transmission<br>i don't think they're relevant<br>and a related question would your<br>hypothesis on large droplet size have<br>implications for<br>transmission in more or less humid<br>environments<br>yes i think it would um one of the<br>the larger the droplet size the longer<br>and once it's dried out the porous virus<br>basically<br>cooks the other thing about droplet size<br>is interesting i think<br>i think there's been evidence to suggest<br>that that<br>the virus is able to maintain itself<br>longer on<br>things like stainless steel which you're<br>taller<br>so the droplets less likely to evaporate<br>so there's some<br>all sorts of funny little things like<br>that that i think are relevant<br>but only time will tell in terms of<br>whether<br>that speculation if you like there's any<br>value at all<br>thank you do you have any idea what the<br>separate<br>r values between and within clusters are<br>for coverage<br>oh i think when you when i showed you<br>the<br>epidemic curve one thing about that form<br>of curve which is called a generalized<br>exponential curve<br>is their additive so when you model the<br>disease in the population<br>you're actually modeling all the<br>clusters if you like<br>add it all up together and so when<br>people<br>model the disease and come up with an rv<br>the value they're getting<br>is really the r value of<br>people within a cluster or in a group<br>so an r value of three for example<br>i think applies very well to a person<br>who's infected either within the family<br>or within a close environment like a<br>prison or a<br>rest home or that sort of circumstances<br>then i think that's the sort of value<br>that they are actually estimating when<br>they're modeling it<br>that's what they're going to come up<br>with but in terms of the general<br>population i think our value is<br>extremely low if you're not within one<br>of these clusters i mean<br>myself and phil hill have suggested that<br>you can<br>think of a population as a whole of<br>people<br>but from a societal perspective you can<br>consider a population<br>as a whole load of networks of people<br>and it's the networks of people that the<br>number of networks of people in the<br>population which may be much more<br>important<br>in terms of assessing whether your<br>cluster epidemic propagates and how much<br>it propagates<br>so um and we've written something on<br>that we're<br>hoping we'll see whether it bounces we<br>might find it's an old idea after all<br>but<br>we'll see um so uh<br>i probably lost the question now i've<br>rambled on it<br>not at all not at all one more has come<br>in and<br>how far into an epidemic is it possible<br>to establish the or number<br>does it take a week does it take months<br>well you should be able to get it<br>it depends how fast the cases accrue in<br>what circumstances they are accruing<br>um should be able to get a handle on<br>that uh<br>within probably the first hundred cases<br>you'd want to<br>you want to get some sort of idea de<br>novo from that we are lucky in the sense<br>that i mean china and other places they<br>had it first<br>so there's actually quite a bit of<br>information out there before the<br>virus got into new zealand so<br>um we're lucky we we could see this<br>coming<br>we're an island nation we watched it<br>come and thought we could cope with it<br>when it arrived<br>well that's what a lot of other<br>countries thought too and we<br>we i think we missed something there<br>and it's cost us about 60 billion</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
