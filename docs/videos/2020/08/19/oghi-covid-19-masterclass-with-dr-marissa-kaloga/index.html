welcome to day five of the<br>covered 19 master class<br>i'm jackie henningham manager of the<br>otago global health institute<br>augie for short today's webinar will run<br>for approximately an hour and a half we<br>should finish at around 1 30 new zealand<br>time<br>our webinars are all being recorded and<br>will be available on the augie website<br>later<br>we're also live streaming through the<br>augie facebook page<br>during the webinars each speaker will<br>give their talk and you can ask<br>questions at any time<br>through the q a function at the bottom<br>of your screen<br>after the talk i will then read the<br>questions allowed for the speech to<br>respond<br>if we're not able to get through all the<br>questions we'll ask the speakers to<br>provide written responses which we'll<br>post<br>there may be a slight change in our<br>program this morning one or two of our<br>speakers have not yet come online<br>so we may actually switch the program<br>around<br>on your program it says that um dr<br>ashley bloomfield will be speaking first<br>today<br>um but there may be a slight change to<br>that program so what we're going to do<br>is the second speaker of the day dr<br>marisa khaloga<br>who is a lecturer in the university of<br>ottawa's<br>social and community work program and<br>who coordinates the communities and<br>organisation series<br>her research is in the area of economic<br>justice marissa will<br>speak first today and her presentation<br>will cover<br>economic justice social determinants of<br>health<br>and new zealand's post-colored recovery<br>marisa<br>tenecotto<br>um thank you to the otago global health<br>institute for hosting the series<br>um and for your invitation to speak<br>today and thank you to the<br>attendees that are here live um and<br>those also watching the recorded seminar<br>and thanks for your flexibility in<br>changing the schedule around a little<br>bit<br>um today i'm going to be talking about<br>economic justice<br>health and new zealand's post-covered<br>opportunities<br>so i'm going to begin with some key<br>concepts in systems thinking that are<br>going to allow us<br>to use the same lens of inquiry these<br>are high level overviews<br>and references are available at the end<br>of the presentation if you'd like to<br>take more of a deep dive after this i'm<br>going to review<br>what income and wealth inequality are<br>i mean how they've operated in new<br>zealand following i'm going to compare<br>the effects of the 2008 global financial<br>recession<br>to what we're seeing now i amid the<br>global coven pandemic<br>and finish up the presentation by<br>offering<br>three big ideas for creating a better<br>future<br>so before i start talking about money<br>and economics it's important to center<br>this talk on what actually<br>matters which is people<br>my interest in economic justice is born<br>from an understanding of the importance<br>of material<br>not just theoretical justice but in the<br>end<br>it's always about people so i'm going to<br>take a few minutes to introduce several<br>concepts<br>systems thinking social determinants of<br>health<br>intersectionality privilege and<br>discrimination<br>these are key ideas that are necessary<br>for understanding the kind of inequality<br>that exists<br>and how coven 19 both reveals and<br>enhances it<br>so to do this i'm going to show you a<br>series of circles<br>and at the end we should all be thinking<br>so the first circle i'm showing you is<br>the ecological<br>systems theory um this is social works<br>person in environment approach which is<br>centered on bronfman<br>bomb preventers theory which is shown<br>here it conceptualizes the individual as<br>nested within a complex set of systems<br>each level interacting with the next and<br>ultimately having influence<br>back on the individual they go from<br>individual to a microsystem which might<br>be a family or school<br>a meso system which is the interaction<br>of those microsystems<br>the exosystems which you can think of as<br>industry or<br>community or social services and the<br>macro system attitudes and ideologies<br>in a culture because of this one cannot<br>understand the individual<br>independent of these systems they are<br>one in the same<br>this can be understood to operate on<br>biological<br>psychological social and environmental<br>levels<br>the second circle is the social<br>determinants of health<br>which will likely be familiar to members<br>of otago global health institute<br>they're shown here using dollar and<br>white heads 2006 rainbow model<br>and it's a similar approach to<br>understanding the factors that influence<br>a person's health status and outcomes<br>you can see local economy community<br>natural environment global ecosystems<br>these are complex structures and systems<br>that influence a person's health<br>such that their health cannot be<br>understood independently<br>ecological systems and social<br>determinants of health are<br>helpful in creating a systems thinking<br>framework<br>but they're not sufficient in<br>understanding how individuals<br>experience that system intersectionality<br>shown here is a term created by kimberly<br>williams crenshaw that means the<br>interconnected nature of social<br>categorizations which create overlapping<br>and interdependent systems of<br>discrimination and disadvantage<br>this was originally meant to support the<br>creation of a feminism that included the<br>experiences of women that were both<br>female<br>and black in america but it's proven to<br>be an important concept to understand<br>the differential impacts<br>of large structural discrimination on<br>individuals<br>so intersectionality helps to explain<br>how privilege and oppression binaries<br>shown here translate into lived<br>experiences<br>certain social identities are privileged<br>the ones above the line<br>while others are oppressed the ones<br>below the line in the u.s a prime<br>example would be that white populations<br>are privileged<br>while being a person of color explode<br>exposes the individual<br>to oppression there's many listed in<br>this diagram they could be<br>male female upper class lower class<br>young<br>old european origin or indigenous the<br>binaries<br>operate across all levels of the<br>ecological system<br>from internalized depression all the way<br>to national level structures<br>that intentionally or unintentionally<br>systematically<br>on an individual level if one person<br>discriminates against another it could<br>mean not getting a job or something like<br>that<br>but when it happens on a systemic level<br>remember we're systems thinking right<br>now<br>there are population-wide impacts that<br>i'll explain in a moment<br>but if we understand discrimination to<br>be intersectional<br>and structural this means that someone<br>who is female<br>poor and an ethnic minority will be<br>further marginalized by the combination<br>of those intersectional identities<br>so when we see inequalities in data<br>which we will<br>they must be understood intersectionally<br>oppression and discrimination are<br>created<br>they're not the normal order of things<br>when we see them in our communities and<br>in our countries<br>we must accept that they were created<br>dismantled<br>so i've shared my circles with you and<br>we have a better shared lens now<br>using an internet intersectional systems<br>perspective<br>so how does this apply to wealth and<br>income inequality<br>this graph is a compelling one and one<br>that has generated<br>much academic debate in the past few<br>years on the y-axis are the index of<br>health<br>and social problems and the x-axis is<br>the degree of<br>income inequality we can see that there<br>is a strong trend for countries with<br>higher income inequality to also<br>have a higher degree of health and<br>social problems<br>this is population wide it's not just<br>restricted to those in poverty<br>so income inequality itself shows that<br>it's linked with health problems<br>and population-wide increases in infant<br>mortality<br>others<br>so income inequality the first of our<br>key uh concepts for today<br>refers to the difference between earned<br>wages across all deciles<br>so income itself is just restricted to<br>paid wages and doesn't include assets<br>like houses<br>or liabilities like consumer debt so the<br>graft to the left of the screen shows<br>the trends in income inequality over 30<br>years in new zealand<br>the bottom 10 percent<br>the bottom line is the poorest ten<br>percent then above it is the middle and<br>the solid gray line is the richest ten<br>percent but that solid black line is the<br>richest one percent<br>these trends continue today however the<br>trend lines represent an overall figure<br>for all of new zealand so what do you<br>think the gender and ethnic makeup of<br>the top line is<br>what about the bottom do you think it's<br>an accident that it ended up this way<br>looking within just one sector the ways<br>that intersectionality play out in<br>income inequality is jarring<br>you can see at the top european men and<br>at the very bottom pacific women<br>and this is in one specific sector<br>it's important to observe because<br>general figures of income inequality do<br>not take these large differences into<br>consideration<br>the difference in income is not just a<br>class issue it is a<br>result of systemic injustices that place<br>certain groups of people at lower wages<br>the result of overt discrimination as<br>well as structural systems that<br>disadvantaged non-pacquiao<br>the import it is important to note that<br>in the public sector there's significant<br>progress in this area<br>one of the reasons i chose to highlight<br>it because things can be done<br>to address inequality and when those<br>so i teach the community organizations<br>paper in the social and community work<br>program<br>and so in class we talk often about<br>macro issues<br>and analyze structural inequities that<br>create or contribute to social<br>injustices felt<br>in the individual level and during these<br>discussions and i've taught these<br>courses<br>in the us and in africa and in new<br>zealand the question is always asked<br>okay so how do you solve poverty it's a<br>good question but it's one that<br>obviously a struggle to answer i don't<br>think that poverty can be eradicated<br>completely<br>it can be mitigated and managed but not<br>necessarily erased<br>instead let's rephrase the question and<br>think how easy is it for people to get<br>out of poverty how to get out of that<br>economic state<br>this is economic mobility and how long<br>people stay in poverty is crucial<br>so while individual decisions and<br>actions have important roles to play<br>at its heart it's a systemic issue<br>because of this addressing income<br>inequality is insufficient<br>the more important question when<br>considering this is the idea of wealth<br>inequality<br>so income inequality figures show some<br>inequality must be addressed through<br>interventions like living wage<br>employment and education programs<br>however it's just not sufficient<br>wealth inequality illustrates the true<br>extent of the<br>drastic disequilibrium of resources in<br>new zealand<br>wealth is things like property and<br>housing cash and financial investments<br>retirement savings valuable and durable<br>goods<br>like cars or furniture the image to the<br>left here is<br>a rather well known wealth tower of new<br>zealand if you look at the top few<br>floors you see that the wealthiest one<br>percent have them<br>all to themselves then the next three<br>and a half floors are the wealthiest ten<br>percent<br>and then the next forty percent have<br>four floors but the most<br>radical thing here is that the poorest<br>fifty percent have just half<br>of the ground floor this is the true<br>extent<br>of inequality as well if we again apply<br>the intersectional lens we can see that<br>that bottom floor is not made up of an<br>equal representation of all the athlete<br>groups in new zealand<br>here we see the median net worth by<br>ethnic group in new zealand<br>and european people have a median net<br>worth of 114 000<br>asian people 32 000 maori is 23 000<br>pacific is 12. so that ground floor<br>of the tower is disproportionately<br>non-popular<br>while communally held maori assets are<br>not included in these figures<br>their inclusion would not fill that gap<br>shown here<br>so by now you might be thinking this is<br>very unfair<br>well i agree social and economic justice<br>are really central concepts for social<br>work researchers like me<br>who engage in action and community<br>engaged research to address<br>inequities<br>so what is social justice it's a term<br>that comes up quite a bit but it can be<br>tricky to pin down<br>i really like the salvation army's um<br>explanation of social justice<br>i think it's a really accessible idea<br>that social justice is about fairness<br>and one of those aspects of fairness is<br>about distribution<br>of income wealth and power in society<br>this has always been central<br>economic justice and how resources are<br>distributed<br>and i could give you a grand um you know<br>64 thousand dollar<br>word explanation of economic justice but<br>the hamburger says it better than i<br>could<br>um martin luther king jr um this is a<br>quote here that he's<br>always understood social justice to be<br>tied to<br>economic justice and he says now our<br>struggle is for genuine equality which<br>means economic equality<br>we know it's not enough to integrate<br>lunch counters what does it profit a<br>person<br>to be able to eat at a lunch counter if<br>he doesn't earn enough money<br>to buy a hamburger and a cup of coffee<br>it isn't enough to be able to go to the<br>restaurant you have to be able to buy<br>the hamburger<br>as such economic justice is up opera<br>operationalized social justice is the<br>tangible<br>result of policy or theoretical<br>approaches<br>so while the bottom floor is quite<br>obviously deprived of social justice the<br>real question is<br>can they afford the hamburger lived<br>material realities are important<br>no one could work hard enough for enough<br>hours to address the nine to one ratio<br>between the top ten percent and the<br>bottom ten percent it's a question of<br>so this brings me to thinking about our<br>situation now<br>in 2008 irresponsible and risky<br>investment strategies<br>by the american upper class went very<br>bad and this<br>led to the 2008 global financial crisis<br>it shook the world into recession and<br>was felt in new zealand<br>while the 2020 coveted crisis is<br>primarily a health emergency<br>it has significant spillover effects in<br>multiple areas<br>it's already impacted the economy<br>through decreasing international travel<br>and restricting tourism<br>and it's important to understand that<br>the way that the global financial crisis<br>affected populations<br>will likely be seen again this graph<br>shows the increase in unemployment in<br>new zealand as a result of the crisis in<br>the late 2000s<br>and understand that the employment<br>unemployment figures here<br>disproportionately represent people from<br>minority populations<br>as a result of the ongoing global crisis<br>current unemployment is 4.2 percent<br>expected to rise to 8<br>to 10 in the spring these numbers will<br>also<br>contain more people vulnerable in our<br>communities<br>so crises do two things whether they're<br>financial recessions<br>pandemics or natural disasters they<br>reveal the inequities already existing<br>in social structures<br>and they further entrench those<br>inequities on the right are three<br>examples of how this might play out<br>minority populations overall have less<br>money and less savings<br>this means they can't absorb unexpected<br>expenses and opens up your financial and<br>asset losses during a crisis<br>like a home minority populations have<br>lower levels of education<br>which leads to less employment stability<br>so that precarious employment which<br>might be<br>part-time temporary or contract work is<br>often the first to go during a crisis<br>and finally minority-owned small<br>businesses are overall less capitalized<br>because of this they're less likely to<br>have reserves to support the<br>continuation of their business<br>during a crisis this leads to negative<br>financial<br>outcomes for marginalized populations<br>less money<br>equals loss of material wealth<br>precarious employment<br>equals higher rates of unemployment and<br>less capitalization<br>leads to business bankruptcy so<br>solutions must include approaches<br>that both repair what was lost and also<br>provide<br>additional opportunities to reduce the<br>underlying inequities<br>so now that we've peeled back the layers<br>of the onion<br>what are we supposed to do with that<br>wicked problem of economic injustice<br>and income and wealth inequality there's<br>so many ways we could address this but<br>today i'm going to talk about<br>so these solutions aren't mine and<br>they're not hard to find<br>universities government ministries and<br>research institutes have been writing<br>about them for some time<br>the difficulties lie in actual<br>implementation of these solutions in<br>complex social<br>economic and political contexts the<br>first is<br>reform tax policy so wealth has<br>accumulated those top few floors as a<br>direct result of tax and inheritance<br>policy<br>it wasn't always that way and it doesn't<br>have to continue<br>the ability for a few to own the most is<br>not equitable<br>and the two most um popular ways people<br>have proposed to do this<br>is to start having a wealth tax that<br>would tax capital gains<br>as well as having a higher income tax<br>band<br>housing stability middle-class wealth is<br>created through homeownership<br>in many cases and right now we're seeing<br>an entire generation that might be<br>priced out of this opportunity<br>so it's really important to build<br>quality affordable housing<br>but barring that it's important to make<br>long-term renting<br>a more stable and appealing option for<br>and finally inclusive entrepreneurship<br>business creation and ownership must be<br>accessible across all populations<br>entrepreneurship is a channel for<br>increased revenue<br>but even more importantly community<br>leadership and political engagement<br>we need to create business support<br>structures that address hidden needs of<br>vulnerable populations<br>as well as potentially do capitalization<br>of minority owned small to medium<br>enterprises<br>so my own research on economic justice<br>in new zealand examines entrepreneurship<br>and<br>minority populations as a community<br>development social worker my practice<br>experience was in this area<br>and i've worked in the u.s and in west<br>africa to support minority owned small<br>to medium enterprises<br>and to research what they need to be<br>successful<br>on a structural level i'm working on a<br>project to map dunedin's entrepreneurial<br>ecosystem using social network analysis<br>i want to understand what services exist<br>and who is using them so that we can<br>understand how might we create a more<br>i'm working to create inclusive<br>entrepreneurial support<br>organizations um ethnic minorities and<br>women are underrepresented in<br>entrepreneurship in dunedin<br>so we are engaging with community<br>partners to understand the situation<br>and working on community-led<br>intervention creation using a<br>human-centric design process<br>finally i'm working with my colleague dr<br>anari ekitone to create an economic<br>justice research and action network to<br>bring people together who are all<br>working on the solution<br>to use a justice lens to examine<br>economic inequality issues<br>we're currently gathering invested<br>parties who would be interested<br>so i'm going to end my presentation<br>today with the claim that economic<br>justice<br>is a determinant of health without it<br>the vision of a healthy new zealand<br>would be difficult to attain<br>the impacts of income and wealth<br>inequality were apparent before covet<br>the effects were not random but they<br>were the result of decision-making over<br>time<br>they negatively affect minority<br>populations in intersectional ways and<br>must be<br>actively dismantled covid revealed their<br>effects and also enhanced them<br>such that the general population at<br>large cannot look away<br>right now and that's actually a good<br>thing<br>right because we all want new zealand to<br>be prosperous and more equitable<br>the solutions to the problems thankfully<br>are not unknown but we know that<br>implementation<br>is complex and difficult and so i<br>propose that postcovid there is a unique<br>opportunity<br>to come together using the focus and<br>political unity of the country<br>to address these long-standing<br>inequities using a social and economic<br>thank you marissa i'm sure we'll get<br>questions coming through soon<br>nothing has has come through yet<br>but perhaps people were taken unawares<br>because we had to<br>have your presentation first while we're<br>waiting for one or two questions to come<br>through are there any<br>perhaps additional insights you may want<br>to share from the work that you've done<br>either relate to your presentation or<br>otherwise yes um<br>it's it has been interesting um moving<br>from um i was working in west africa as<br>a fulbright scholar<br>doing similar work prior to that in the<br>us<br>doing similar work working with minority<br>populations and small business<br>development<br>um and in new zealand and there<br>obviously are very contextual<br>differences between all of these<br>um three places for example guinea does<br>not have a functioning social welfare<br>system<br>the us has somewhat of one in new<br>zealand has a very robust one<br>in the way that this impacts minority<br>populations who are interested in<br>starting small businesses has been<br>interesting to look at<br>thank you thanks very much let's have a<br>look i think we may have one<br>okay uh thoughts on universal basic<br>income<br>you know it's interesting uh when it has<br>been implemented it has<br>shown to be successful i think there's a<br>canadian implementation that<br>showed that it did have positive effects<br>on health<br>and economic justice and we had a<br>democratic presidential hopeful that<br>did a great job of explaining what it<br>actually was to the american people<br>so i think that it's it's an opportunity<br>i don't have any expertise in that area<br>but i do know the studies that have<br>actually done it have seen<br>promising results thank you<br>just a comment here amazing presentation<br>thank you in one person so that's always<br>nice to hear<br>uh do you have any comment to make on<br>possible associations between wealth<br>inequality and outcomes from covert 19<br>if they exist how might they operate and<br>you know i spoke to this<br>briefly in the presentation and that um<br>any type of crisis um disproportionately<br>affects<br>minority populations um and we see this<br>in clovid as well um<br>then people who are infected the<br>impact of those infections the access to<br>health care<br>all of that puts pressure on households<br>that<br>don't have extra and so<br>those households are more vulnerable and<br>reactions to it likely because the<br>employment to begin with was precarious<br>and so progress employment which may be<br>something like a temporary worker or a<br>seasonal worker<br>um those wages also tend to be lower<br>okay quite a complex topic there<br>and um marissa we're actually going to<br>go go to our next speaker now because he<br>does have a very tight schedule<br>thank you so much for your confirmation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
