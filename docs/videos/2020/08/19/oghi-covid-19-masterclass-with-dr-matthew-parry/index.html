organizers for<br>letting me talk to you today about<br>understanding modeling of cover 19<br>spread i know you'll be a bit alarmed<br>that a mathematician maybe or a<br>statistician is<br>talking about this area so i thought i'd<br>lead up front with a quote from<br>isaac bogosh who's a epidemiologist in<br>canada<br>and he said we need to put the clinical<br>back into clinical epidemiology<br>so this is just to reassure you that um<br>i'm not going off in some<br>uh high in the sky mathematical<br>framework just for the sake of it but we<br>really are trying to address<br>real epidemiological questions now i<br>should point out that<br>um isaac bargos was one of the first<br>people to actually<br>point out that cover 19 was a serious<br>threat and with pandemic potential<br>very early on so quickly outline i'm<br>told<br>with short talks you shouldn't give an<br>outline but i thought it might be<br>helpful anyway<br>we'll talk about three things um for the<br>second one<br>in more detail but the first one is what<br>are the models of disease spread for<br>and here when i talk about spread i'm<br>generally going to be talking about<br>spreading the population<br>and it's only later on that i'll talk<br>briefly about spatial spread which of<br>course is<br>often what spread conjures up in our<br>minds<br>so what do they be used for then also<br>what models have been used for covert 19<br>spread<br>and that's what i'll spend my time and<br>then we'll talk a little bit about what<br>so these are the three reasons we might<br>use models uh<br>the disease spread um and if you<br>remember nothing else<br>i'm hoping that you'll remember these<br>three points and they<br>are linked together but the first one i<br>want to emphasize is that models are<br>used to understand the properties of the<br>epidemic<br>and they're not to make precise point<br>predictions so it's been a lot of work<br>if people are trying to predict in a<br>month or even next week<br>how many cases there might be and giving<br>some precise number<br>and of course being vocally inaccurate<br>and embarrassingly so<br>and it's important that we're not that's<br>not our job when we try to model<br>an epidemic we're trying to understand<br>the properties of the epidemic<br>and i'll apply that a little bit later<br>on<br>uh the models we use are to answer<br>epidemiological questions of interest<br>and so therefore must be informed by<br>epidemiology so<br>we're not just trying to do some time<br>series analysis trying to extrapolate<br>from the last few data points into the<br>future but we're saying there is a<br>process happening here<br>that we need to input into our model and<br>it won't make sense otherwise<br>and so that's why we talked to<br>epidemiologists and so what are the<br>relevant<br>variables here what are the relevant<br>processes here that we must implement<br>to some degree in our models and then<br>finally what we use models for<br>uh is to simulate possible future<br>trajectories of the epidemic<br>so again we're not trying to pinpoint<br>exactly what where things might be but<br>we're trying to look at a fan of future<br>possibilities uh to see where we might<br>end up and there's a great quote on<br>twitter which i didn't find i couldn't<br>find it but<br>talking about trying to prune off<br>branches future branches which are<br>not advantageous so if we can learn that<br>from our model we can know what<br>control measures might prevent us from<br>going along certain paths<br>so that's a really valuable part of<br>okay so let's talk about now what models<br>are being used for cover 19 spread so<br>there's<br>essentially two main models um i've<br>listed three<br>and i'll explain that in a second first<br>of all there's compartmental models<br>uh then there's what i call branching<br>process models sometimes also called<br>generation time models<br>and then either these can be made more<br>complex<br>to also to answer more complex questions<br>and they can be brought into what might<br>be might call network models<br>models of structured populations<br>individual based models and that's where<br>we can put some spatial structure in as<br>well<br>so the first two are really the building<br>blocks um<br>for the models that get used and i think<br>it's important to point out that at each<br>point as we ask more<br>refined questions we have to have more<br>and more refined models<br>and that's why you'll see a sort of a<br>gradual ramping up<br>of the complexity of the model as we go<br>through<br>so now i did say i was a mathematician<br>in a statistician so<br>there are going to be a few well<br>actually no there's only three equations<br>and one's recycled so in fact this is it<br>this is all the math you're going to see<br>today but i wanted to just put a little<br>bit in here<br>just so you get an idea of some of these<br>in this case compartmental models<br>so this is your classic compartmental<br>model called an sir model for obvious<br>reasons<br>and so people individuals move through<br>the component compartments of the model<br>at a certain rate so we'll talk about<br>that in a second but they can be in a<br>susceptible class<br>susceptible to infection they can then<br>move to an infected class which is in<br>this case also identified as being the<br>infectious class<br>and then finally they might recover as<br>well<br>so those are the compartments you move<br>through and the key idea<br>i've linked these components of arrows<br>so every time you see an arrow<br>in this talk there's going to be some<br>rate parameter associated with it<br>and this is the only slide in which i<br>use in greek so in this case i'm<br>indicating that beta is the rate<br>for which transmission happens and mu<br>here is the rate at which recovery<br>happens<br>in future i'm just going to have arrows<br>and you'll understand that there's a<br>probably at least one or 8 parameter<br>associated with with each arrow<br>now the key idea then for uh sir model<br>is to say what happens how many<br>how do the numbers in those classes<br>compartments change over<br>time and this is the fundamental<br>equation as i say this is the only one<br>we're going to look at but it's key i<br>think to this<br>understanding of compartmental models we<br>want to say what's the change in the<br>number of infected<br>individuals well there's two terms as a<br>contribution positive contribution from<br>people moving from the susceptible class<br>into the infected class<br>and the key thing is this depends on how<br>many people are susceptible and also how<br>many people are infectious so this is<br>what's called a nonlinear term which<br>makes things<br>more complicated um and that gets<br>multiplied by the change in time so<br>obviously the longer you wait the more<br>uh you'll expect to see the number of<br>effects that increase but there's also a<br>decline<br>there'll be people moving out of the<br>infected class into the recovered class<br>and that depends on how many people are<br>on the infected class so that's a<br>negative contribution is overall that's<br>the change in the number of people in<br>fact and you can then obviously<br>propagate that through to the change in<br>the number of susceptible people<br>and they change the number of other<br>people but by itself that's the key<br>equation<br>for the sir model and what i've<br>discussed is a little bit<br>is that from this model we can back out<br>the basic reproduction number so<br>in an otherwise susceptible population<br>how many people one infected individual<br>in fact and it can be computed as a<br>ratio of those two rates<br>so this is the second equation uh and<br>you'll see here it's the ratio of the<br>transmission rate beta so the<br>recovery rate mu so if the mu recovery<br>rate is very small it takes a long time<br>to recover then<br>it will be quite big because potentially<br>and if the transmission rate is high<br>also r nor will be high so you can see<br>how those two rates combine to<br>okay so let's see what it looks like<br>when you do a run the model<br>uh here i'm plotting in green that the<br>ratio<br>of the number is susceptible or sorry to<br>the proportion of the number of several<br>people in the population<br>uh and in red you've got proportion of<br>infected individuals<br>and you can see initially there's a<br>definitely an exponential growth<br>which we expect to see in it in the<br>epidemic but then of course it peters<br>out the reason why it starts slowing<br>down is because there are fewer<br>susceptible people<br>in the population uh in this case things<br>level up<br>over some time and in fact at the end is<br>about 10<br>or just over of the population we're<br>so this is um for r naught is 2.5 so if<br>you know some of the literature around<br>covert 19 2.5 is sort of roughly where<br>people think arnold is<br>plus or minus so you can see that it's<br>by left to its own devices<br>covered 19 is a very serious epidemic<br>now it's not actually a great model the<br>sir model because we don't really expect<br>people to become simultaneously infected<br>and infectious at the same time<br>and so the workhorse of most models of<br>compartment<br>mental models for epidemics is the seir<br>model<br>and so we're going to insert an extra<br>compartment in here which is the exposed<br>compartment<br>so you move to becoming exposed and then<br>subsequently at a certain rate you<br>become infectious and that's that point<br>of course<br>you can start affecting more individuals<br>in the population and then at some point<br>you also recover<br>so this is a great thing about<br>compartmental models they're very<br>extensible you can add in<br>more compartments and i'll show you some<br>examples in a second<br>but very early on in this cycle this is<br>a very interesting paper<br>so i want to stress read at alpe that<br>came out at the end of january<br>2020 and they used an seir model to<br>understand the properties of the<br>epidemic emerging from by province<br>uh what's interesting about this is use<br>data up to january 22nd which is when<br>controls are put in place in wuhan<br>and this paper the second version of the<br>paper came out on the 29th of january so<br>in fact<br>just within a few days they had got the<br>data<br>and fit this model to estimate the<br>parameters of the epidemic<br>now one thing i will come back to is how<br>important it is in these kind of models<br>you need to be able to um investigate or<br>observe the entire trend<br>chain of the of the<br>of the model so unfortunately you don't<br>really know if you'll become exposed<br>well some subsequently you can you can<br>maybe find out<br>some contact tracing and interviews um<br>to find out when people might have been<br>exposed but<br>in a short turn around time they had no<br>idea when people had become exposed they<br>only knew when people were becoming<br>infectious<br>or recovering so that was the only data<br>they had so they were kind of missing<br>information<br>about a key part of the process which is<br>going from exposed to infectious so<br>they just had to assume it and they had<br>some they looked other coronaviruses and<br>so on and they said well<br>we'll have to assume a later period of<br>four days which turned out to be not too<br>bad<br>in fact but then at the end after that<br>you can also estimate the infectious<br>period the time<br>it takes you on average to recover and<br>they got 1.61 days which to our minds<br>now probably seems<br>very very small but it's not as bad as<br>it sounds as it sounds<br>as i'll explain in a second and then the<br>key idea is that from those two numbers<br>they're able to<br>estimate arnold and so they've got 3.11<br>which i would probably say now<br>is a bit on the high side but if you<br>look at the confidence interval it's<br>between 2.4 and 4.1<br>so right really the current numbers say<br>2.5 to 2.7<br>it captures those really well so this<br>really shows the advantage of having<br>some data a model and that you can do<br>something quite useful in a short amount<br>of time<br>which is to show that this is a disease<br>which has an epidemic potential<br>that will that are not as large as three<br>that's a very serious disease so you<br>might quibble later on so it's actually<br>2.5<br>but that doesn't really substantially<br>change our conclusion<br>and to get a better sense of what's<br>happening in these models it's quite<br>useful to<br>plot what they're calling an infectivity<br>profile and the reason why it's not<br>quite so clear from the compartmental<br>model<br>is that it does something kind of weird<br>it takes individuals and sort of smears<br>them out so they move from being<br>acceptable then they become partially<br>exposed and they become passionate you<br>know partially infected<br>and so um it's not that they move at one<br>point<br>from one compartment to the other at a<br>certain point in time and so<br>we can actually plot what the sort of<br>you like this smeared out individual<br>looks like in terms of infectivity and<br>that's in this orange curve here<br>based on the read at our paper<br>and it has it's very typical of the sei<br>models that you become infectious<br>straight away<br>not your you don't not that high value<br>but you<br>that peak comes a bit later but you<br>become infection straight away and<br>that's kind of<br>probably unlikely in most diseases<br>and then you have quite a long tail in<br>fact the reason why at one point<br>the infection period of 1.61 days have<br>had been longer which we kind of think<br>it is<br>um then in fact this tail be even worse<br>it'd be a much<br>fatter tail so it was basically trying<br>to compensate for the fact the model<br>wasn't great at this point early times<br>uh and so it made some<br>had to sort of constrain itself at later<br>times and what i was trying to do<br>probably was trying to<br>mimic its blue curve which is now the<br>more accepted<br>effectively profile which comes from<br>branching process models<br>which we'll talk about later so it's<br>just a sort of caveat when you see these<br>numbers coming out of sdi models<br>they don't quite necessarily mean what<br>you think they mean if you plot the<br>infectivity profile you get a better<br>okay so those models i've discussed i<br>really didn't say but in fact they're<br>called deterministic models because<br>there's no<br>actual randomness inherent in them and<br>we know that epidemics and most things<br>in life are<br>inherently random so in stochastic sir<br>model<br>is a useful thing to to do in fact most<br>models now would be<br>would be stochastic so you have a<br>stochastic cir model as well<br>uh anyway so i just want to show you<br>what happens here so this is that<br>recycled equation i warned you about<br>instead of saying the change in i had<br>these two contributions a positive and a<br>negative contribution<br>really what we're saying is the average<br>change in i can be understood in this<br>way<br>and in fact in a well described way we<br>also know what the fluctuations then<br>will be in the change in eye so this is<br>the key idea and so instead of trying to<br>show your math i thought i'd show you<br>some pictures and here all these are<br>light green curves are the sort of<br>proportions septals<br>in different simulations from this<br>epidemic and so you can see this<br>inherent<br>stochasticity in it sometimes they drop<br>down quite quickly other times you see<br>the proportion stays quite high and then<br>drops down<br>but that bold green curve is the<br>original<br>deterministic sir model so you see they<br>grouped around that that curve so on<br>average that seems to be the right thing<br>but of course you can get quite a bit of<br>career variability<br>and one thing i really want to stress is<br>there's actually this horizontal green<br>line here as well<br>this is a case in which there was an<br>infected person but they recovered<br>before they affected anyone<br>just by chance and therefore the<br>epidemic stopped<br>and that's something you never see in a<br>deterministic sir model and it's crucial<br>in epidemic models to understand that<br>this stochastic these fluctuations can<br>actually lead to<br>epidemic extinction only when you've got<br>small numbers of cases but<br>and that's the situation we're in new<br>zealand at the moment and so that's a<br>key idea<br>and you can't get that idea from a<br>deterministic<br>and i think the way you're stressed<br>about this point too every every curve<br>you're seeing here is from the same<br>choice of parameters so you can see how<br>hard it is to estimate parameters<br>each of those curves okay so it comes in<br>the same parameter<br>value so you can see they look very very<br>different yet they'll<br>sort once imply that it might be our job<br>to actually estimate parameters which is<br>which is actually the case<br>okay as i said these compartmental<br>models are extensible and uh<br>we've actually used these models with<br>adding some more compartments inside<br>them to capture things like<br>uh asymptomatic transmission um include<br>different stages intermediate stages of<br>activity<br>quarantining and so on so it's quite<br>nice it's quite fun to play this game<br>because it's like lego<br>you put in new new blocks of various<br>places<br>a key thing of course it's actually<br>based on epidemiological evidence<br>consultation with the experts so here we<br>put in a pre-symptomatic class<br>this is a scenario where you you're<br>exposed<br>but you're not showing any symptoms yet<br>but you're still mildly infectious<br>and so that's a reasonable model of<br>carbon 19 and so that's<br>something you'd like to include another<br>option is that you have an asymptomatic<br>class<br>which is also infectious so when someone<br>becomes exposed there's a sort of a<br>bifurcation that happens either<br>you become an asymptomatic carrier or<br>you become infected and<br>infectious with symptoms and both of<br>these classes are contributing to the<br>spread of the epidemic but maybe<br>at different different rates and then<br>both classes that eventually recover<br>so those kind of models are quite<br>possible to spread you can also<br>to use and you can also instead of<br>having a cinematic class here you can<br>make this a super spreader class<br>people that seem to be much better at<br>affecting others<br>very hard of course if you're trying to<br>estimate the parameters in this model if<br>you don't know the asymptomatic people<br>then you can't measure that part of the<br>process and so<br>this is why there's still a lot of<br>discussion about the role of<br>asymptomatic transmission<br>of carbon 19. so there's been a couple<br>of applications i want to briefly<br>mention um<br>that wilson ethel a couple of papers<br>that came up back to back<br>using a stochastic compartmental model<br>to quantify the efficacy of existing<br>surveillance methods<br>so managing a situation there's only a<br>few cases in the population<br>how long will it take for us to protect<br>them using the current methods we<br>have also flipping that around saying if<br>we have lots of<br>days as we did in new zealand with no<br>cases<br>how certain could we be that uh 19 has<br>okay so there is a draw backwards<br>compartmental models this is assume that<br>expansion distributed waiting time in<br>each compartment so<br>there's a bit of jargon here but it's<br>just the<br>nature of these models that they have a<br>funny situation where the distribution<br>how long it takes to move to the next<br>class peaks at zero which is a bit odd<br>outcomes and that's one of the things<br>you saw in that infectivity profile how<br>quickly you become infectious which<br>doesn't seem<br>realistic so that can be um can be<br>ameliorated by using intermediate stages<br>but another approach which is very nice<br>is the branching process method which is<br>inherently stochastic<br>and basically it models the generation<br>time directly so here i'm showing<br>a picture where individual orange is<br>infected<br>and we're seeing the chain of infections<br>which happen subsequently so the pink is<br>the first generation<br>and then that generation of infections<br>also led to<br>the green generation of secondary<br>infections and then a great<br>connection so that's the branching<br>process you can sort of see it quite<br>vividly<br>the key thing to note here is that we're<br>also saying that the infections happen<br>at different times so<br>although the pink or the first<br>generation when they happen was actually<br>at different points in time so we want<br>to be able to model that um and so the<br>generations get jumped up eventually you<br>can see for example here's a<br>in this third generation occurring<br>before a second generation<br>but this is very easy to model uh using<br>branching processes and the key<br>idea here is r naught now is the average<br>number of people infected by each<br>individual<br>infected individual that sort of tells<br>you on average how many branches you'd<br>expect to see from each<br>each point in that graph so this is the<br>accepted generation time model based on<br>a paper<br>by freddie adele which is basically that<br>blue curve i showed you before<br>but now it's been turned into have the<br>form of a probability of distribution so<br>it's a slightly misleading<br>thing to do it's not a probability<br>distribution but it's just if you sum up<br>those red dots you get one<br>um and if you want to convert that into<br>a statement about the um<br>how the branching process is going to<br>run you multiply it by r naught<br>uh and then say for example at five days<br>we have point two<br>here we multiply that by say two point<br>five i know we get a point five and what<br>it says<br>on average on day five you're going to<br>infect<br>0.5 people okay which seems a bit<br>ludicrous what it really means is that<br>there's a good chance or<br>no one but there's also a good chance it<br>will take one person<br>maybe even two and overall if you use<br>this profile<br>on average you'll be infecting 2.5<br>people<br>so this has been used this has been<br>found by films data<br>and more data that read it hal didn't<br>have at the time so for example they<br>actually looked at<br>the using content data between uh to<br>find the generation time between<br>pairs which is crucial to determining<br>the shape of that<br>so these have been applied um quite<br>extensively um<br>they can also be very easily general you<br>know extended customized<br>uh similar to compartmental models but<br>very very useful kind of ways so for<br>example<br>you can include the detection<br>probability what happens if someone<br>gets sick but don't doesn't get tested<br>or the test itself<br>doesn't report them as being positive so<br>it's very easy by tracking individuals<br>through a branching process<br>to include those kind of important<br>effects<br>um this um generation time model has<br>been used extensively by the researchers<br>that<br>matatini and if we release a number of<br>papers related just to spread october 19<br>in new zealand<br>uh so plankton in april talked about<br>modeling the effect of the alert levels<br>and showing the importance of fast case<br>isolation<br>and bennington recently talked about<br>estimating the effective<br>uh reproduction number during lockdown<br>and they found for example that rt was<br>about 0.35<br>so now it's time to just bring this<br>together and then try to add some more<br>sophistication to the models to answer<br>more sophisticated questions<br>we've been assuming homogeneous<br>well-mixed populations<br>and now we want to address questions<br>like the spatial spread<br>um age-dependent effects and so on and<br>so this<br>diagram here and it's just to show you<br>these could be cities<br>uh with epidemics occurring inside them<br>and because of content<br>or movement of people between the cities<br>then it attempts to be<br>augmented by a possible arrival of<br>infected individuals or it could be<br>groups in a population different age<br>groups and the interactions between them<br>will be mediating the disease as well<br>and because there's two errors on these<br>plots there's two rates you need to know<br>about<br>to understand how these different<br>class groups are interacting<br>and so there's been some interesting<br>applications of this and this is it does<br>tie in a little bit to<br>uh the last talk by angela um so there's<br>researchers also looked at a structured<br>model to understand possible age and<br>healthcare inequities<br>and this is because we know that cover<br>19 is much more virulent<br>in older age groups and understanding<br>how the<br>age groups interact with each other and<br>they help us understand<br>how well help us understand how you can<br>prevent that<br>um also access to health resources<br>uh is really key as well so modeling<br>that was an important part of this paper<br>by alex james co-authors um i should<br>point out<br>as well that um to do this you need to<br>have more information so<br>is that always every time you have more<br>sophisticated modeling anymore or data<br>in order to estimate the parameters<br>and there is quite a bit of information<br>in most countries now about how<br>different age groups<br>interact with each other what the<br>contact rates are so that's really<br>important<br>there's also been some experiments have<br>been done<br>using mobile phones and so on to attract<br>individuals<br>anonymously but to understand how people<br>move and we'll talk about that in a<br>second as well<br>i should point out the relay dale also<br>did include movement between cities and<br>hubei province<br>so that was a little bit more<br>sophisticated than i gave them credit<br>for<br>previously and then finally we've got<br>individual-based models which are<br>really a detailed model sometimes<br>they're called agent-based models but<br>they incorporate known behavior and<br>movement of individuals<br>this is um amazing in the west you know<br>modern entire populations um key idea<br>here<br>is that these open circles are<br>individuals and the population<br>and they interact at locations so the<br>solid<br>dots color coded at different locations<br>and in fact would be lots of green dots<br>and lots of blue dots of course<br>and you'll see over here we've got a<br>household all interacting in the same<br>house<br>but of course they also have<br>interactions in other places so this<br>person goes to work<br>and that's where they meet someone who's<br>infected and that's where<br>a transmission event might occur of<br>course then they go home and like pass<br>along to their<br>people in the household and then that<br>person one of their people goes to<br>school and they might pass on so you can<br>sort of see how this happens<br>these models include this really<br>detailed individual level<br>based understanding of how the epidemic<br>evolves unfortunately these require a<br>lot of<br>information there's not many places to<br>have these kind of models<br>already set up but australia is one of<br>them<br>and so i'm just jump to the second point<br>here um australian census-based epidemic<br>model has been up and running for quite<br>some time<br>it's been used in the past with flu and<br>this was used in may<br>to understand the effect of a number of<br>control measures the curve at 19<br>and they found out chang adele that<br>school closures were unlikely to have a<br>decisive effect because they found that<br>uh<br>based on data that seemed that children<br>were not important<br>vectors of the disease uh and an<br>information called kachowski<br>now which is another interesting one<br>which was already developed<br>a few years ago on the bbc pandemic data<br>set where volunteers agreed to<br>install an app on their phone choose<br>bluetooth to<br>to notice when it came in close contact<br>someone else using the app<br>and they use this to understand the<br>efficacy of isolation<br>and various other control measures to<br>reduce the transmission that starts<br>so the last part then what are the<br>challenges of modelling cover 19<br>in some ways these are actually<br>challenges for any modelling of disease<br>spread<br>the system itself the disease system is<br>dynamic<br>it's sarcastic it has exponential<br>behavior and it's<br>actually really hard to model that<br>behavior so anyone who tells you<br>differently is trying to sell you<br>something<br>um and that's why uh<br>we've seen some rather erroneous<br>predictions about the future course of<br>care over 19.<br>one other thing is that um of course<br>epidemic seldom have to run<br>the course and so people change their<br>behavior their central control measures<br>are imposed and that adds further<br>complexity to<br>interpreting the data that's uh<br>just always going to happen um in the<br>case of cover 19 we still have questions<br>around acid piece of dramatic<br>transmission<br>or it's a pre-symptomatic transmission<br>or a combination of both<br>um and so we're still uncertain about<br>that<br>we do have always uncertainty and data<br>with incomplete data so i mentioned<br>before we don't know for example when<br>someone became exposed<br>maybe we can tell somewhat um maybe<br>censored not politically censored but<br>statistically censored uh the data may<br>be unreliable it may be delayed getting<br>to us and so they also have to<br>incorporate<br>into how we use the data to estimate<br>parameters in the model<br>and certainly the parameters themselves<br>is really key so i i've given you<br>uncertainties in the estimates of r0 and<br>rt but the other parameters i sort of<br>said are the incubation mean occupation<br>time is 5.5 days<br>as if this will set the same of course<br>it's not um that's just the<br>best guess and there's a confidence<br>interval for that parameter as well<br>and so all these kind of uncertainties<br>are important to incorporate and that<br>there's a sort of rounder sensitivity<br>analysis which has to happen in any kind<br>of mod<br>i thought i'd just check with one little<br>thing at the end what does pandemic<br>radius look like if you're a modeler<br>you need to have a suite of models at<br>hand including pre-adapted models so<br>by that i mean models a bit like the<br>australian census-based academic model<br>if we have a ground truth model of what<br>individual behavior looks like<br>then of course we can very quickly<br>utilize it to understand how control<br>measures will affect the spread of a<br>disease<br>we need to know in advance what data<br>will be needed so once we know the model<br>we can ask what data we need to estimate<br>its parameters<br>and then we have to have therefore the<br>ability to collect that data so that's<br>really important i think a few<br>accommodates have made this point but<br>it's really data which is so important<br>knowing when people are tested if<br>they've been tested what the result was<br>where they were<br>where they came from these are all<br>really crucial to estimating<br>uh parameters and so to having that in<br>place is important<br>and the last comment is just around<br>statistical computing that's actually<br>important too um and maybe i'll come<br>back to this in a second but<br>um it needs to be in place it's quite<br>hard to quickly<br>take these models and fill them down it<br>doesn't happen overnight<br>and so that that sort of procedure<br>has to be ready and waiting for the next<br>pandemic<br>and i just have a few references here at<br>the end<br>all right we'll have a few questions<br>coming through in the meantime and<br>in terms of modeling for copper 19 how<br>different is it to modeling for other<br>epidemics is it just a case of swapping<br>up those lego blocks<br>in the compartmental model i think yeah<br>well<br>of course i would say that um because<br>models<br>yes i think so the the key thing is that<br>every<br>yeah every arrangement of those blocks<br>disease and so you can't just i mean<br>people very early on say that's just<br>like fluid of course it's not so that's<br>going to have an impact on<br>how you model and that's why you can't<br>get to sit alongside epidemiologists<br>and jointly devise what the best kind of<br>model will be<br>in this case and you mentioned obviously<br>the importance of data your model is<br>only going to be as reliable as the data<br>you get<br>do you find as the epidemic rolls along<br>it becomes easier and you have more<br>confidence<br>more and more confidence in the model i<br>think so with the<br>um we're bringing him more confidence in<br>the parameters<br>um whether we've got the right model<br>maybe i should have said that there's<br>uncertainty in the model itself<br>and is that capturing everything that's<br>there so this is where simulation can be<br>very useful because you can take your<br>your model that you've got your blood<br>sweat and tears to get parameters for<br>and you can run simulations on<br>if they don't look like the epidemic<br>that's happening<br>then you know you haven't you haven't<br>done something right<br>and how do you take into account the<br>cluster nature of covered expansion<br>in models yeah that's a that's a good<br>point so<br>um i did skip past saying that um i<br>mentioned for example that<br>um you need to multiply by and obviously<br>i'm not showing my screen<br>i'm showing it myself anyway um when you<br>i said let's say our naught is 2.5 for<br>example that would tell us on average<br>how many people<br>uh an infected individual would be<br>would inflict but of course we have a<br>phenomenal super spreaders<br>and so instead of saying um your values<br>up it's 2.5 what we can say is well<br>everyone's got their own individual r<br>and on average it'll be 2.5 but if you<br>something you'd be<br>basically a church choosing from a<br>distribution so some people may be less<br>than<br>91 less than one other people are 15.<br>that's a possibility as well so we have<br>examples of the super spreader phenomena<br>in recently in south korea and even in<br>new zealand<br>and so that that can be incorporated<br>thank you dr matthew perry we have<br>reached the end of today's webinar<br>thanks once again to associate professor<br>angela valentine and dr matt perry<br>and we will be back tomorrow at 12 for<br>the<br>9th day in the covered 19 masterclass</p></main><footer
