will introduce him<br>professor stephen knowles<br>who is in the department of economics at<br>the university of otago<br>his research interests include the<br>economics of altruism<br>with a specific focus on what motivates<br>people to donate to international<br>development charities<br>stephen will discuss the relative costs<br>of intervening against covert 19 across<br>the world<br>stephen thank you jackie<br>um so before i start my talk i'd just<br>like to thank the organizers for putting<br>this together so<br>philip hill was very much involved in<br>this it was his idea so thanks phillip<br>for all the hard work you've done<br>and also jackie hettingham has been<br>doing an awful lot of work in the<br>background as well as being our host for<br>these<br>uh talks for the last couple of weeks<br>every day so thank you jackie for what<br>you've done<br>and uh the av guys here have been<br>extremely helpful too so thank you for<br>your hard work<br>um i'd also like to acknowledge um all<br>the other speakers so<br>i haven't seen all the talks for the<br>last two weeks but i've seen most of<br>them and i've really enjoyed them<br>and i've also learnt a lot um so what<br>i'm talking about<br>is the relative costs of intervening<br>against covert 19<br>across the world and i just want to make<br>sure that everyone understands before we<br>begin exactly what i'm going to talk<br>about so it could be that some of you<br>are hoping that what i'm going to do is<br>say well here's been the dollar cost of<br>fighting covert 19 per life saved in new<br>zealand and compare it<br>to what's happening in other countries<br>i'm not going to do that because as i'm<br>going to explain that's actually a<br>really difficult<br>task to do what i am going to do<br>is talk about what's been happening in<br>the new zealand economy<br>in recent months while covert 19 has<br>been with us<br>um also talk about why it is extremely<br>difficult to<br>you know talk about how much it's cost<br>for each live we've saved<br>but then to give a bit of a global<br>health perspective i'm going to talk<br>about what we do know<br>about how it's relatively cheap to save<br>lives in<br>developing countries around the world<br>and poorer countries in the world<br>and that's not going to be with respect<br>to coded but just what we know<br>in normal times<br>so let's have a look at what's been<br>happening then to the new zealand<br>economy<br>and i should mention that um the three<br>graphs that i'm going to show you two of<br>which are on this slide and<br>one of which is on the next slide um<br>they are from the treasury's<br>website and every week on a friday the<br>new zealand treasury<br>puts up a new weekly update on the<br>economy in covet 19.<br>so the data i'm going to talk about from<br>last week's<br>information because this week's one i<br>don't think is up yet and even if it is<br>it wasn't up yesterday when i had to<br>submit my slides<br>so in terms of what's been happening to<br>the new zealand economy<br>if we have a look at um this figure on<br>the left here<br>um the key figure to focus on is that<br>for the march quarter<br>new zealand's gdp has fallen by 1.6<br>which is the biggest quarterly drop in<br>the last decade<br>and now by the march quarter we mean<br>what's been happening for the months of<br>january<br>february and march and we know that much<br>of that drop in<br>gdp would have been occurring in the<br>march quarter<br>what we'd really like to know is what's<br>happened in the june quarter that is the<br>court are taking in<br>the months of april may and june but<br>that data<br>won't be available for some time but we<br>know that you know there was a<br>pretty big drop in the march quarter<br>so to get some sort of more timely data<br>if we have a look at this figure<br>on the right here this is showing retail<br>spending<br>by new zealanders from february um<br>through to<br>on the 21st of june and these data are a<br>seven day rolling sum and what we can<br>note<br>is that uh back in february and early<br>march that<br>um retail spending in new zealand was<br>about 1.6 billion dollars<br>um per seven days but it's interesting<br>to note that um sort of fairly early on<br>in march<br>that figure actually started to fall so<br>before we went into lockdown<br>spending was already starting to fall<br>and we can see a bit of an uptick<br>uh in here sort of just before lockdown<br>as people are rushing out buying all the<br>toilet paper they think they're going to<br>need and<br>food and other essentials and then we<br>can see this pretty dramatic effect here<br>of spending falling very dramatically<br>as we go into level four and as we<br>progress<br>through level four and there's a bit of<br>a slight<br>increase there in spending is there's<br>more stuff that we're allowed to buy<br>online and people get more used to doing<br>that<br>and then we have an increase in spending<br>as we go into level three<br>and then as we go into level two and<br>then again as we go into level one<br>but one thing we can note from this<br>figure is that<br>retail spending now is pretty much back<br>to where it was<br>um pre-covered 19 but we've got this big<br>chunk of retail spending in here that<br>didn't happen<br>and is kind of lost for good as it were<br>what's happening in terms of jobs well<br>on this slide i've got information on<br>the number of people on either a job<br>seeker<br>or an income support kind of scheme<br>so these bars here in blue these are the<br>weekly changes in the number of people<br>receiving the job seeker<br>benefit and the figures in the sort of<br>mustardy<br>color here they're people that are<br>receiving the um recently introduced<br>income relief payment and obviously it's<br>been fairly recently that<br>people have started receiving that<br>perhaps what's of most interest is the<br>black line here which is focusing not on<br>the rate of change but the total number<br>of people<br>that are on some sort of income support<br>and back in january that was just under<br>150<br>000 people but now it's almost 200 000<br>people so there's an additional 50 000<br>people<br>who are receiving some sort of job<br>support<br>and obviously in addition to these<br>people who are unemployed<br>we also have quite a large and<br>significant number of people<br>who probably only still in work because<br>their employer<br>is receiving the wage subsidy and as the<br>wage subsidy<br>has started to be phased out then we<br>might see further we'd expect to see<br>further increases in unemployment but<br>for now we've got about a fifty thousand<br>dollar<br>say not dollar we've got about a fifty<br>thousand person<br>increase in the amount of unemployment<br>and what some people might be tempted to<br>do at this stage is say well if only we<br>could come up with an estimate of how<br>many<br>lives have been saved as a result of<br>going into lockdown on the other<br>policies<br>that have been introduced to fight<br>covert we could then work out how many<br>jobs have been sacrificed<br>for every life that's been saved but i'm<br>going to caution against doing that by<br>talking about why it's difficult<br>to put a figure on what it's cost new<br>zealand for each life saved from covert<br>19.<br>and there's basically two<br>counterfactuals that we don't have<br>firstly<br>we don't actually know how many lives<br>have been saved as a result<br>of the policies that have been<br>introduced<br>um there are estimates out there and<br>michael baker mentioned<br>his estimate um in one of the sessions<br>last week i think it was last monday<br>where he talked about information that<br>he and others had put in front of the<br>ministry of health and the government<br>suggesting that if we essentially did<br>very little to fight covert 19<br>that there could be an excess of 12 000<br>deaths so<br>let's just assume that there's been<br>about 12 000<br>lives saved i'm not qualified to talk<br>about whether that's a reasonable<br>estimate or not but<br>let's just imagine that it is<br>the problem we would then have though is<br>that we simply don't know how the<br>economy would have fared<br>if we've done this to combat covet 19<br>essentially it's difficult to separate<br>the effect of the disease<br>from the effect of the lockdown itself<br>so i want to suggest that some<br>at least possibly many of the jobs that<br>have been lost<br>would have been lost if we hadn't gone<br>into lockdown and to give some examples<br>international tourist arrivals in new<br>zealand would have plummeted<br>even if we had not closed the borders<br>overseas tourists would<br>be worried about coming here because<br>they'd be fearful about whether<br>they could get home again so many of<br>those jobs that relied on international<br>tourism<br>would have been lost anyway in terms of<br>other jobs and particularly in the<br>hospitality sector<br>if we've done nothing to fight covert 19<br>then it seems likely that we would have<br>had<br>significant community spread of covert<br>19<br>and that would have meant that even if<br>it wasn't mandated that we had to stay<br>at home there would have been plenty of<br>people who would have chosen to stay at<br>home anyway<br>they wouldn't be going out to<br>restaurants or bars and going<br>to the movies and in case you're not<br>quite convinced on this point i want to<br>talk about some research that's done a<br>comparison between denmark and sweden so<br>we know that countries with less severe<br>restrictions<br>have suffered economic losses and to<br>give one example<br>consumer spending in sweden has fallen<br>by 25<br>which is almost as much as in denmark<br>where it fell by 29<br>that's even though sweden did not go<br>into lockdown<br>um but denmark did and i've listed there<br>um the authors of that particular piece<br>of research so<br>we simply don't know how many jobs would<br>have been lost<br>if we had not gone up the levels and<br>ultimately<br>gone into lockdown and people might come<br>up with estimates or guesses but<br>that's basically all they are<br>so what i want to think about now is<br>well what exactly<br>do we know about the sacrifices that new<br>zealanders made to save lives and<br>you know we've all seen many posters<br>like that one there put out by<br>the ministry of health encouraging us<br>all to stay at home<br>and save lives and by and large new<br>zealand's team of 5 million<br>were very happy to stay at home and to<br>save lives even though for many<br>that involved making great sacrifices<br>and we know that<br>you know there's a poll that was taken<br>that shows that 92 percent of new<br>zealanders<br>approved of the government's decision to<br>go to level four but<br>for many people there were major<br>sacrifices made<br>in doing that and i'm just going to run<br>through now what some of those<br>sacrifices were<br>so for example it might be that people<br>were not able to visit family in<br>hospital<br>or in rest homes not being able to<br>attend<br>funerals or maybe weddings that were<br>postponed there's plenty of examples of<br>that happening<br>and then there's people who have had to<br>accept a very significant pay cut<br>in order to keep their job and also<br>we've talked about the people who<br>have paid the price of actually losing<br>their job and we know that so far<br>there's about 50 000 such people<br>so what we do know is that most new<br>zealanders were prepared to make large<br>in some cases very large sacrifices<br>in order to save lives and to bring a<br>bit of a global health<br>perspective into this i now want to ask<br>the question of well<br>is it possible to save lives at lower<br>cost if there are new zealanders who<br>have<br>developed a taste or preference for<br>making sacrifices to save the lives of<br>other people<br>are the easier ways of doing this<br>and the answer to that question is that<br>it is<br>but these are the lives of people living<br>in the world's poorest countries<br>rather than the lives of people living<br>in new zealand<br>and the reason for this is that there's<br>lots of low-hanging fruit out there<br>that's left to pick in these countries<br>and what i mean by that is<br>low-cost interventions with large<br>benefits<br>and the effect of altruism movement has<br>drawn attention to the fact that those<br>wanting to do the most good they can<br>with their charitable donations<br>would be best to target these donations<br>to charities<br>working in developing countries and more<br>specifically on health projects<br>and i want to talk about what some of<br>these sorts of<br>low-hanging fruit are and i'm going to<br>give an example of one that saves lives<br>and another<br>another couple that don't necessarily<br>save lives but have huge<br>positive impacts on people's health so<br>the first one and this is evidence from<br>randomized controlled trials is we know<br>that<br>roughly about a thousand dollars spent<br>on distributing<br>anti-malaria bed nets in africa will<br>lead to 10 additional<br>quality adjusted years of life now<br>one of our speakers earlier in the week<br>noted that not everybody's that keen on<br>the idea of quality adjusted life years<br>from an ethical perspective<br>so if that's you another way we could<br>think about this data is to say it<br>costs about two thousand dollars<br>typically to save the life of a<br>reasonably young<br>person um by distributing anti-malaria<br>bid nets<br>now of course the bid nets themselves<br>don't cost a thousand dollars the<br>typical cost of one of these nets is<br>about<br>ten dollars but not every nit that's<br>distributed will<br>end up being used and not everyone who<br>doesn't use an anti-malaria bed and it<br>is going to catch malaria<br>and die as a result and that's where<br>randomized control trials are really<br>helpful we know that for every thousand<br>dollars spent on distributing these nets<br>that<br>an example that many new zealanders will<br>be familiar with is the work of the fred<br>hollows foundation and the fred hollows<br>foundation can restore someone's<br>eyesight for about a hundred dollars in<br>terms of the<br>marginal cost of doing that so that's<br>not quite the same thing as saving a<br>life but<br>it's certainly an intervention that can<br>greatly improve the quality<br>of people's lives another example that's<br>often talked about<br>is deworming of children and this is<br>extremely cheap it costs less than<br>a dollar to do it in your typical<br>developing country<br>but it improves not only children's<br>health but also<br>their school attendance and there's some<br>evidence that it can improve their<br>uh income and later life when they enter<br>the workforce so there's<br>a lot of low-hanging fruit out there but<br>the question that this then poses<br>is well you know how generous are new<br>zealanders and how<br>often is it that we give to<br>international development charities the<br>likes of the fred hollows foundation or<br>world vision<br>oxfam tear fund etc<br>well according to the world giving<br>survey new zealanders are amongst the<br>most generous<br>people in the world in their most recent<br>survey we come in at third place<br>australia's in second place so<br>um we lose out to them but uh new<br>zealand<br>is in third place so on a whole new<br>zealand is a very generous<br>nation but less than ten percent of<br>donations each year go to international<br>development charities that is the<br>charities working<br>um with um people in need and low-income<br>countries<br>overseas and it's a wee bit of an aside<br>to this a point that's been made by<br>tom coop at the university of canterbury<br>is that if we look at the economic<br>relief package that the new zealand<br>government has put 50 billion<br>aside for as part of that there is some<br>money that they've put aside<br>for economic development in other<br>countries particularly<br>in the um pacific islands but the amount<br>of money that's been put aside is about<br>one dollar for every thousand<br>of that covert 19 rescue package<br>and people might reasonably argue i<br>suppose that it's the new zealand<br>government's job<br>to look after the health and welfare of<br>new zealanders<br>not people overseas but new zealand<br>along with the other developed countries<br>of the world<br>many years ago made a commitment to<br>spend 0.7 percent of our gdp<br>each year on international development<br>that is on foreign aid<br>and we don't come close to achieving<br>that<br>now a research question that i've looked<br>at<br>over the last few years with a couple of<br>co-authors is to look at the question of<br>why<br>don't more donations go to international<br>development charities and<br>by the way i should note that new<br>zealand's not alone in this most other<br>developed countries have a fairly low<br>share of total charitable donations<br>going to international development as<br>well one<br>possible explanation for this that trudy<br>sullivan and i have explored is that<br>there's many more charities out there<br>supporting people and<br>causes in new zealand then there are<br>supporting<br>uh international development efforts and<br>if i was to ask you to name some<br>international development charities you<br>might<br>come up with world vision oxfam save the<br>children thread foreign might name one<br>or two others<br>but i'm sure you could name many tens of<br>charities that are focused on<br>domestic causes within new zealand and<br>why is this important well<br>if there are people out there that give<br>a small sum of money to every charity<br>that asks them for money<br>or if there's an element of randomness<br>and how people choose to<br>what which charities to give to the fact<br>that there aren't that many<br>international development charities<br>might help explain why they get a fairly<br>small share<br>of the money so in research with trudy<br>sullivan we wanted to<br>come up with an experiment where we gave<br>people the choice of only two<br>charities to donate to one international<br>development charity<br>and that was world vision and one<br>charity helping people in need in new<br>zealand and that was<br>the salvation army and the way that we<br>did this was it<br>was as follows we donated from a<br>research account<br>ten dollars to charity and returned for<br>participants completing a survey so<br>we sent letters out to people inviting<br>them to do our online survey<br>and they knew that if they completed the<br>survey by a specified date that we'd<br>give ten dollars to charity and they<br>could choose<br>if that money went to world vision or to<br>the salvation army<br>well in terms of the results 28.4<br>chose world vision with the remainder<br>choosing the salvation army so even when<br>we<br>narrow it down to a choice of an<br>international development charity or one<br>helping people in need in new zealand<br>that the majority still go<br>for the charity helping people in new<br>zealand<br>and of the 215 participants that chose<br>the salvation army there were 133<br>who gave a reason for their choice of<br>charity and<br>we can see the results from that on the<br>screen here<br>i'm not going to go through all of these<br>responses due to<br>the time constraint that we've got but<br>you can see that 52 percent of those<br>people<br>made a comment along the lines of<br>charity begins at home<br>and one thing i've been thinking about a<br>little bit recently<br>is i wouldn't be surprised of the number<br>of new zealanders who you know sort of<br>make arguments like charity begins at<br>home i suspect that number might have<br>gone up<br>as a result of what's been happening<br>lately you know<br>we're all used to hearing the message<br>that if we want to help rebuild the new<br>zealand economy that it's important<br>that we spend money locally and that's<br>an important message and i by and large<br>agree with with that strategy<br>but i think it would be unfortunate if<br>it's a country we became more inward<br>looking<br>as a result of this and forgot about you<br>know causes overseas that are<br>important as well and another piece of<br>research and this is work done<br>with um marat gentian treaty sullivan<br>and we've explored<br>um the question of how much new<br>zealanders care<br>about how efficient their donations are<br>and we analyzed this using a discrete<br>choice experiment<br>and this discrete choice experiment<br>asked participants to make a number<br>of peer wise choices and that generated<br>information about how important<br>they thought the following attributes<br>were when making charitable donations<br>the first of those attributes is where<br>the donation<br>will be used and there were three<br>different levels here one was<br>new zealand another was a country close<br>to new zealand and another was a country<br>far away from<br>new zealand the second attribute was the<br>expected benefit<br>to recipients and that could be either<br>low medium or high<br>and the third attribute was the need of<br>recipients that could either be<br>low medium or high so in terms of<br>the sorts of questions people were asked<br>so they<br>answer a series of peer-wise trade-off<br>questions like this<br>one here where they were asked which of<br>these two hypothetical charities<br>they would prefer to donate to so<br>there's the one on the left and the one<br>on the right for the one on the left<br>the need of recipients is medium but the<br>expected benefit of a donation is high<br>for the one on the right the need of<br>recipients is high but the expected<br>benefit is low so<br>if you you know cared a lot about need<br>of recipients and not so much about<br>how effective the donation was going to<br>be you'd go with this option here<br>and after going through a dozen or so<br>peer wise choices like that<br>the software that we use which is the<br>1000 mind software i've got to put a<br>plug in there for my colleague paul<br>henson<br>and the software could generate for us<br>information on how much weight<br>people put on each of these attributes<br>and the information i'm about to show<br>you is not the weight<br>that was attached to the attribute but<br>instead<br>the percentage of people who thought<br>this particular attribute was the most<br>important<br>and we can see that for over half of the<br>sample where the donation will be used<br>was the most important thing to those<br>people expected benefit in need of<br>recipients<br>was not quite so important so again we<br>see evidence of people placing<br>more emphasis on where the donation is<br>being spent better it was spent at home<br>than overseas um and they're not so<br>interested in<br>you know the expected benefit whereas<br>i've been making the point that we can<br>get more bang for our buck as it were<br>to focus on health problems in<br>developing countries but that seems to<br>be something that's<br>not so important to the majority of<br>participants in our research<br>also as part of this research<br>participants were asked<br>in which country do you think a donation<br>of 100<br>uh to spend on the health of the poor<br>would lead to the biggest improvement in<br>people's health and we gave people<br>three options new zealand a poor country<br>overseas<br>or not sure and we were interested to<br>find out<br>how many people were actually aware of<br>the fact that there's these<br>opportunities to<br>get a lot for a small investment in poor<br>countries overseas<br>and here are the results about as many<br>people thought that the<br>money would do as much good in new<br>zealand as it would<br>overseas so there's a lot of people out<br>there that simply aren't aware<br>um of what effective old process would<br>be arguing<br>so in conclusion um covert 19 has had a<br>devastating effect on<br>the new zealand economy but it's<br>difficult to separate the effect of the<br>disease<br>from the effect of the lockdown<br>also new zealanders were prepared to<br>make large sacrifices to save<br>people's lives um and for those who want<br>to keep saving lives it's possible to<br>save the lives of people living in poor<br>countries overseas with a much smaller<br>sacrifice<br>than what most of us seem prepared to<br>make to save lives<br>uh during covert 19 lockdown here in new<br>zealand<br>that's it from me thank you very much<br>stephen<br>i have a few questions that have come<br>through<br>first of all 90 of the population<br>supported the level 4 lockdown<br>but do we know what proportion of the<br>population who were majorly affected for<br>example lost their jobs<br>supported the level 4 that we don't know<br>but um so there was eight it was eight<br>percent of people who<br>didn't support the lockdown um and of<br>those inevitably given the number of<br>people who have<br>lost their jobs or had reductions in<br>their income<br>it seems inevitable that some of them<br>would fall into<br>that category um but yeah i've also<br>spoken to business people who think that<br>you know the best thing<br>for what has been done was actually to<br>go on to lockdown<br>for that period obviously we hear in the<br>media about<br>business people who weren't so keen on<br>that but it's perhaps not quite so<br>newsworthy to report people that were<br>that could be true is there any<br>indication that new zealanders have<br>indeed<br>increased their spending with local<br>businesses and on new zealand-made<br>products<br>to support the economy since lifetime<br>not that i'm aware of i mean anecdotally<br>you know we've probably all talked to<br>people who are more conscious of wanting<br>to spend locally<br>and i've certainly talked to people like<br>that so i'm not but i'm not saying<br>there's no hard evidence<br>on this i'm just saying if there is i'm<br>not aware of it okay<br>uh hi stephen in the slide displaying<br>the dc e paid choice used by james<br>knowles and sullivan<br>the country of recipients new zealand or<br>overseas did not appear to be included<br>as an attribute<br>was that part of the tv so um no so<br>uh i don't it might be useful if i could<br>go back to the<br>relevant slide that that is a good<br>question but i can't answer it so if we<br>go<br>back to the okay so<br>i can't actually bring up the slide i<br>don't think so i think what the person<br>asking the question is referring to is<br>an example of a trade-off question that<br>i gave<br>there were multiple trade-off questions<br>that people answered<br>and two-thirds of those trade-off<br>questions that they would answer<br>would actually have the country yes one<br>of the things they were trading off but<br>the example i gave was focusing on the<br>other two attributes<br>but yeah everybody who answered it would<br>have been asked questions about the<br>country they wanted it to be spent<br>all right what what actions would you<br>based on your low-hanging fruit abroad<br>premise considered appropriate<br>in relation to the economic struggles<br>both domestic and international<br>so in normal times and non-covered 19<br>times there's research that's being done<br>by looking at randomised controlled<br>trials that suggests that if we want to<br>get the biggest bang for our buck<br>the best things we can do in terms of<br>interventions in developing countries<br>is anti-malaria bed nets and worming<br>they're the<br>two that are thought to be the most cost<br>effective<br>in current times i i'm guessing that<br>just making<br>hand washing and sanitation more<br>available to people is probably one of<br>the most cost effective ways of<br>producing the<br>of covert 19 but i have to acknowledge<br>that speculation on my part i'm not a<br>possibly distributing hand sanitizer to<br>developing countries or poorer countries<br>maybe<br>maybe just a bar or so but also running<br>water<br>is often something that's scarce in<br>those countries as well and and that's<br>what makes<br>fighting covert 19 for developing<br>countries so much more difficult<br>than it is here for us i know hand<br>sanitizer got a bit scarce for a while<br>but<br>yeah it wasn't difficult to find a bar<br>of soap and hand sanitizer remained in<br>reasonable supply<br>but you know we take running water for<br>granted and in<br>many parts of africa for example the<br>water is not there for people to wash<br>their hands<br>yeah that's true you point out that some<br>economic losses are attributable to<br>changes in consumer behavior<br>in response to the pandemic rather than<br>to the lockdown itself<br>and that is excellent your point is<br>excellent it would seem worthwhile<br>and could be feasible to roughly<br>estimate that are you planning to do<br>that<br>it might help make a debate on lockdown<br>less simplistic<br>personally i'm not um i although i<br>mentioned<br>that sort of research that's not the<br>kind of thing i do but i'm sure there'll<br>be economists<br>including some of my colleagues who are<br>looking at that question<br>but one comment that i would make<br>because it's almost too early to be<br>doing those sorts of<br>calculations now if we want to compare<br>new zealand to another country<br>um that other country for all we know<br>might have had<br>less severe restrictions than us<br>initially but if by the end of the year<br>they've still got restrictions in place<br>and we've managed to remain at level<br>one doing the research now would<br>not give us a true picture of what's<br>ultimately going to happen<br>so i didn't mention this during my<br>presentation but i think these questions<br>about<br>which countries adopted the best<br>strategies to<br>maximize the sorry to minimize the<br>amount of<br>harm in terms of the medical stuff but<br>also minimize the harm to the economy<br>it's almost too early to be having those<br>conversations because<br>as we know the pandemic's still with<br>the next question is possibly a bit<br>speculative as well um<br>assuming there may be another lockdown<br>how will new zealand cope with financial<br>costs of the next lockdown<br>labor has already spent 200 billion on<br>lockdown one<br>how can they possibly afford the<br>outcomes of lockdown too<br>yeah well i guess the big hope is that<br>we don't have to go into<br>another lockdown and you know i'm not<br>a public health person so of all the<br>people that have presented in the last<br>two weeks i'm the least<br>qualified to talk about whether we're<br>likely to go into another lockdown<br>but obviously we know that the economic<br>costs of<br>going into lockdown have been<br>significant although again i'd make the<br>point it's difficult to separate<br>the lock down from the effects of the<br>disease<br>obviously if we had to go back into<br>lockdown again that would not be good<br>for the economy so you know business<br>people and i'm sure everybody<br>is you know hoping that that doesn't<br>happen<br>it just you should change the term<br>slightly in terms of donations to<br>international charities and this is<br>not directly related to behavior choice<br>behavior<br>but how much of the money that you give<br>to charities generally gets to the<br>people that you want to help<br>so that's a really good question and<br>what a lot of people would do<br>is look at information on the charities<br>website<br>uh to see what amount of that money goes<br>on overheads<br>and that's an easy figure to find but<br>what i would suggest and many other<br>economists would argue the same is<br>although that's important information to<br>have<br>the more important information is of<br>every one dollar<br>that gets through to be spent on<br>helping people in need how effective is<br>that so you could have a charity<br>with overheads of say 20 where they're<br>getting 10<br>bang for your buck for in terms of the<br>money that makes it through to the<br>people in need<br>you could have another charity with<br>lower overheads<br>but there's not such benefits in terms<br>of what we get back for every dollar<br>that gets to the people in need<br>um anyone who's interested in learning<br>more about this so i'd recommend having<br>a look at the<br>give well website give well as a charity<br>run out of the united states<br>that's made a bit of a an industry out<br>of<br>ranking how effective different<br>charities are<br>and how effective different policies are<br>at helping people in need around the<br>world<br>so another one would be um peter singer<br>has a website named after his book<br>called the life you can save so that<br>would be another<br>interesting one to look at as well but<br>it's dangerous to focus only on<br>the overhead costs and how much of the<br>money gets through<br>it's more important to be asking of the<br>money that goes through<br>how much ban do we get for our buck from<br>that thank you stephen<br>uh one last question um you mentioned<br>that new zealand was ranked third on the<br>world giving scale that's right how is<br>that measured there's a number of<br>people who don't know so it's survey<br>data that's based not just on how<br>frequently new zealanders and other<br>people around the world give to charity<br>but it's also got information in it<br>about volunteering<br>and also performing you know altruistic<br>acts for other members so actually<br>only one third of the weight of that<br>survey is on<br>monetary donations but volunteering and<br>other altruistic acts are in there as<br>well<br>casey nein's wondering the united states<br>came out on top<br>on top for the 2018 version of that<br>survey uh which is the most recent one<br>that's available<br>thank you stephen and that's all we have<br>time for today thank you very much to<br>professor stephen knowles and that<br>brings us to the end of the covert 19<br>masterclass i would like to thank all<br>our speakers once again<br>for offering their time and their<br>expertise i would like to thank you<br>our attendees for your participation<br>and i also would like to acknowledge the<br>e-conferencing team here<br>at the university of otago in dunedin<br>for their great work you guys helped<br>make this masterclass a reality</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
