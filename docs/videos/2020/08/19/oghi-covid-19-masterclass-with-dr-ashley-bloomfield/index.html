course our next speak um he's going<br>to talk he'd be talking about<br>communicating with the public<br>um about covert 19. new zealand's<br>director general for health<br>kiyoko tournament uh thank you very much<br>for the opportunity to<br>uh to present and talk with you today<br>and i'm sorry i was a little late<br>joining the call but uh<br>many thanks to marissa for being<br>flexible and taking that first slot<br>and i just uh as happens and this job<br>got a<br>call from the minister's office i needed<br>to take so look i i just want to<br>share a few thoughts about<br>communications and<br>the role that communication with the<br>public has has played in<br>covered 19 response to date uh share a<br>few few reflections i'm very interested<br>in your<br>questions and comments as well um and<br>the time we've got<br>so um we all know that uh<br>that pup that communication uh is is a<br>critical sort of public health strategy<br>uh whether it's in a<br>in a an emergency or um emerging<br>situation or as part of<br>of any public health program whether<br>it's a a program like immunization a<br>screening program whether it's a<br>disease control program a<br>non-communicable disease control program<br>or a communicable disease control<br>program<br>and i guess the two the two overarching<br>purposes i guess or goals of that<br>communication are to<br>communicate with the public effectively<br>about about risk<br>and and what they can do about that risk<br>or how to think about and manage that<br>risk<br>but also and i think this is a point i<br>really want to draw out is the<br>communicating<br>with them about the why about why it's<br>important<br>and why it is um they may need to act<br>because in any public health program<br>where<br>we're asking people to do something<br>really and usually do something<br>different from what they're already<br>doing<br>and if they understand the why we all<br>know they're more likely to do that so<br>we have this elimination strategy for um<br>for covert 19. it's evolved pretty<br>rapidly as we've as we've gone along<br>since we started our response in<br>late january and that communicate that<br>elimination strategy which is on our web<br>site has talks about these four pillars<br>around um you know the border<br>uh particularly preventing through the<br>cases coming into the country<br>there's um the need for rapid case<br>finding and testing then there's the<br>contact tracing and then there's that<br>the sort of maintaining public uh trust<br>and understanding and i guess and<br>across all of these communication is<br>important but that last<br>pillar is one we can't afford to<br>to lose any momentum on so uh is this<br>covert 19 situation involved in in new<br>zealand and we responded pretty quickly<br>at the ministry to stand up a national<br>health coordination center and<br>very early on i think it was early<br>february my team<br>said to me uh why don't you start doing<br>a daily stand up and in part they had an<br>ulterior motive there because they were<br>getting<br>uh huge numbers of media inquiries every<br>day as we as we do in this organisation<br>and one of the ways to manage those<br>inquiries was for me to<br>start doing a stand-up and um answer<br>questions or gather questions that we<br>could come<br>back to on the next day with any<br>information we had<br>so it was it was great advice from a<br>very experienced<br>comms manager here uh who's been here<br>for a long while peter abernathy and so<br>we started doing the daily stand-ups in<br>a little room in the ministry<br>uh with a small number of journalists<br>who kept showing up every day mostly the<br>health<br>journalists from the various agencies<br>and what uh uh soon realized was<br>actually because<br>uh there was so much uncertainty about<br>the evidence<br>and information was uh evolving<br>and knowledge was evolving so rapidly<br>this actually<br>and because because of that there was a<br>lot of speculation a lot of<br>misinformation out there this gave us a<br>really important direct channel to the<br>public<br>where we could convey um our messages<br>and because the journalists were<br>actually<br>either live streaming<br>uh the the stand up or effectively<br>typing<br>their their um their story directly onto<br>their website<br>as we went it gave us an opportunity to<br>get really<br>clear messages out to the public uh<br>without the the sort of journalistic<br>filter in a way i'm sure they might go<br>back and<br>and write a story about something but<br>in the present we could get our messages<br>out there and that became really<br>important and<br>and what i think it helped with is<br>because i was doing those stand-ups<br>uh with support from uh caroline mcelroy<br>the director of public health<br>uh it was it was the health<br>professionals and and the people<br>um bringing the science to the issue who<br>were<br>at least for the first while making<br>those um<br>or communicating with the public and we<br>had of course a lot of other<br>commentators including scientific<br>commentators and and some you know many<br>of them colleagues like<br>uh michael baker nick wilson we had<br>susie wiles we had um<br>various others making uh uh making<br>comment or<br>making comments or writing commentary in<br>the media<br>and more often than not our our<br>commentary would converge but sometimes<br>there were points of difference<br>but what the public saw there i thought<br>i think was a context<br>a contest of the interpretation of the<br>evidence<br>rather than a political filtering of<br>different<br>um of the evidence<br>and so we could they could see that it<br>was the the different scientific<br>perspectives um<br>interpreting the evidence possibly in<br>different ways but as knowledge emerged<br>then<br>generally converging we also were in a<br>situation where the<br>evidence base was so sparse and the<br>knowledge was emerging so quickly on a<br>day-to-day basis that we were able to<br>uh let the public know what was<br>happening as as that evidence emerged<br>and also put to bed anything that might<br>be a rumor or hearsay or misinformation<br>but i think a key a key role that those<br>early<br>stand-ups played was in essentially<br>establishing a relationship of trust<br>with the public<br>so that by the time we got to uh into<br>march and particularly to<br>the the big sort of the critical day on<br>the 19th of march where<br>uh the the prime minister announced this<br>the alert level framework that many of<br>you will be<br>now very familiar with and i think it<br>was a<br>in a way an inspired piece of of risk<br>communication for the public and it<br>it laid out for people here's where we<br>are and here's what you can<br>expect um probably in the future if<br>things keep going the way they are and<br>the prime minister said look we're<br>currently in a loot level too<br>but we might need to go up alert levels<br>and here are the sorts of things we<br>would consider<br>if we were going to so then the public<br>knew what was likely to happen and could<br>start to prepare themselves for that<br>of course it was only a few a very few<br>days later on the following monday that<br>cabinet made a decision and the prime<br>minister<br>uh the country needed to go immediately<br>to level three and then just a couple of<br>days later<br>um signaled that just a couple of days<br>later we will be going<br>to level four so also known as lockdown<br>um which i'm sure you will all remember<br>well um<br>uh and interestingly the public feedback<br>and we were surveying um<br>both through our health and wellbeing<br>surveys but also<br>the government's uh all of government<br>comms team was getting surveys of the<br>public about<br>you know whether they supported the<br>measures the government was taking and<br>through that lockdown period there was<br>this incredibly high level of support 92<br>percent of people<br>um supported the measure that the<br>measures that the government had<br>had taken including the decision to go<br>into<br>what was a very stringent lockdown<br>um so there was a strong support and at<br>this high level of<br>uh trust and confidence in the measures<br>that have been put in place<br>and again i think the uh<br>the key thing here was that the public<br>had had been prepared<br>so that when it got to a situation where<br>essentially we were asking people to do<br>things that were impacting<br>enormously on their lives and<br>livelihoods<br>um they understood the why of<br>uh they understood the why not just the<br>the<br>what and and the how so i think in<br>in that collective understanding of the<br>why<br>we saw actually the benefits of that<br>lockdown were<br>more than we thought they might have<br>been but because<br>in very large part new zealanders owned<br>and cooperated with the expectations<br>that were put on them<br>and and i think that uh you know we were<br>all somewhat surprised as we came out of<br>the loot level four into elite level<br>three and started to see<br>that not only had we sort of broken the<br>chains of transmission that we had<br>achieved more than we might have<br>hoped we would have so i think that was<br>very important so we<br>we came down through the alert levels we<br>continued that that regular<br>the communication of the public about<br>what was happening um<br>they could see the fruits of their<br>collective efforts and and<br>you know the prime minister who is a<br>very good communicator in her own right<br>and has an excellent team around her and<br>they're constantly getting feedback from<br>and surveying the public<br>so they have these very well well and<br>carefully crafted messages and simple<br>messages that people could relate to<br>and people knew what was happening and<br>one of them of course was the team of<br>five million<br>so people felt a sense of ownership<br>and i think one of the you know one of<br>the key bits of feedback i've had from<br>members of the public and and many new<br>zealanders who have communicated with me<br>from all walks of life is that<br>those daily briefings became uh the<br>almost because people were confined to<br>their bubbles another very clever idea<br>to their bubbles at home this was the<br>way that they felt connected to the<br>wider effort<br>that they knew all at the same time what<br>was going on<br>and what to expect next and i think that<br>was a critical part of being able to<br>communicate effectively with the public<br>to enable a really really good public<br>health response<br>so we came down through the alert levels<br>and you'll all be aware of<br>the pressure that then came on and of<br>course that uh<br>there was the at one minute it's we need<br>to you know we need to go into lockdown<br>or we didn't go into lockdown soon<br>enough and then the pressure was on to<br>come out of lockdown<br>a pace i think we we we've<br>struck a a good balance there but of<br>course then you get into the situation<br>we've found in the last couple of weeks<br>and i've been uh<br>as you would all be aware somewhat in<br>the in the<br>spotlight in that regard is when things<br>what happens and again uh i've<br>uh taken the approach of and it i think<br>is<br>is helping of continuing the same uh<br>approach that we we started right from<br>the outset to<br>front up to present the information<br>to answer questions as a way of<br>making sure that we are maintaining<br>trust which will be the critical<br>part of us continuing to have a really<br>effective response because<br>um even though um i think we had many<br>new zealanders have felt look<br>we're past this we're through covert 19<br>what's next<br>um and when can we see the all blacks<br>play<br>uh we we clearly are not you know this<br>this pandemic rages off our shores and<br>is gathering pace off our shores and i<br>think<br>the events of the last two weeks lost um<br>you know i've had some days that have<br>been more comfortable than others<br>and some extremely uncomfortable what it<br>has uh<br>what it has reminded everybody is that<br>we are we are still in a really really<br>um challenging global public health<br>situation that we need to keep our eye<br>completely on the ball around<br>so just in summary i guess and um<br>i don't want to present for too much<br>longer because i'm interested in in<br>some subsequent quarter but uh three<br>three things really one is that<br>importance of communication<br>is part of the public health response in<br>establishing trust<br>um and through that trust i think we<br>were able to building on that trust it<br>was a fundamental part of our effective<br>response<br>the second thing is that the<br>communication<br>and the re regular communication and<br>building off that trust was people<br>understanding the why and i think this<br>is something we sometimes overlook<br>in our public health programs and the<br>communications that go around that<br>it's not that here's the evidence here's<br>what you need to do it's<br>really connecting with people around the<br>why<br>and the third thing is that really um<br>uh you know this is the no-brainer that<br>communications people the world around<br>will save us<br>you know and you saw this i think<br>through the covert 19 response here<br>today there's those simple messages<br>repeated frequently through a wide range<br>of channels<br>and one of the interesting things that<br>happened<br>we found through the surveys uh through<br>the lockdown is that people<br>shifted from social media it is their<br>main<br>trusted form of communication back to<br>the traditional media<br>and that was i think because of those<br>daily briefings playing<br>such an important role in people's um<br>uh in in people knowing what was going<br>on<br>uh and also knowing what was expected of<br>them so i'll leave my kind of<br>talk or comments uh with that and look<br>forward to<br>thank you dr bloomfield as you can<br>imagine there are quite a few comments<br>and questions<br>um the first one is a comment um<br>just to say i think you and the prime<br>minister have done an excellent job<br>regarding communicating with the public<br>about covet<br>you're transparent open and present i<br>felt well looked after<br>thank you and then a question dr<br>bloomfield<br>as an expat living in melbourne i have<br>enjoyed and been extremely proud<br>of the efforts you and your team have<br>made you mentioned the importance of<br>trust and its fragility<br>what has been the most challenging<br>aspect of building<br>oh uh thanks for that thank you very<br>much for the first comment and the<br>feedback<br>and um look this is this has been really<br>critical and and and the big challenge<br>is uh and i think this is one where we<br>have done and what<br>that has laid behind the effectiveness<br>of our response there was trying to take<br>as much as possible take the issues out<br>of the political arena<br>and um uh you know just to reflect on<br>the the effectiveness of a response and<br>there's been quite a lot of there was<br>quite a lot of focus<br>on where we prepared where we were<br>prepared um and of course it's really<br>clear there are things that we could<br>have done better to prepare and people<br>will be aware of this<br>global health security index review that<br>was done last year i think johns hopkins<br>and another center<br>that rated new zealand's preparedness uh<br>at around 35th in the world and of<br>course<br>but what's become apparent through i<br>think in all countries response is that<br>the ability to take the take the<br>response<br>once and um out of the political arena<br>or at least<br>so that the political imperatives are<br>not the main driver of the response<br>is fundamental to being able to<br>establish that uh public trust and i<br>think one of the things we saw here was<br>certainly you know with with a few<br>exceptions<br>through most of the response there has<br>been this ability to not<br>politicize it um and you know just<br>finish with this comment that<br>you can be as prepared as you like<br>but if you don't have good governance it<br>is all for naught fundamental to an<br>effective response<br>uh our leaders and the political system<br>that quite clearly have the well-being<br>of citizens<br>as the foremost consideration no not<br>personal agendas<br>or political agendas or indeed egos<br>another one thanks for all your work<br>ashley did you find it hard to balance<br>communicating the science and the<br>scientific principles through the media<br>whilst making sure that it's easy for<br>well yes uh i certainly did and um<br>i've got a really good comms team here<br>and<br>as i said earlier on the the prime<br>minister herself is a very good<br>communicator<br>she's well known for that and she's got<br>a good team around here and<br>um i i should point out that every day<br>we would<br>uh i would prepare<br>for some time before uh going on to make<br>sure i had all the information<br>and we had worked through the messages<br>that we were going to convey<br>and when i started doing this you know<br>alongside the prime minister every day<br>11 45 either in person or on a<br>teleconference we would be talking<br>through<br>what were our key uh messages for the<br>day and who<br>comms people would help to shape those<br>in a way that as you say<br>as turning um you know scientific<br>principles and issues around risk<br>into things that the public could<br>understand and i think<br>that you know you can't go past the<br>value of really good comm staff who are<br>who are expert at doing that and i do<br>want to pay a tribute a particular shout<br>out to the<br>the overall comms effort that you know<br>the unite against covert 19<br>um and the extents of communications<br>collateral that went out through so many<br>channels i was one of the people<br>driving on virtually empty motorways and<br>to work every day and you still<br>uh the signs along the motorway would be<br>um exhorting me to<br>to to stay home save lives and be<br>confined<br>uh and we still go out through a huge<br>number of channels so again those<br>the use of people with expertise to<br>craft those nice simple<br>messages<br>thank you do you have any comment on how<br>the communication strategies you used<br>could encourage the team of five million<br>to address the issues raised by marissa<br>particularly with regard to equity and<br>in social justice and fairness<br>oh well i i i don't know if i've got any<br>any clever ideas there but i think<br>uh you know the and i really enjoyed the<br>presentation these are<br>issues that are fundamental to public<br>health and fundamental to the work we're<br>doing here in the ministry<br>um there are lessons there and i think<br>one other thing<br>and one of the things we're trying to do<br>is look at what happened<br>in the health system and across<br>government over that<br>that last those last few months and<br>particularly during the lockdown period<br>and the things that happened that would<br>have otherwise taken years<br>to happen um and what<br>why was that and so that we can retain<br>and amplify those<br>um and and a good example is you know<br>one of the key bits of feedback i got<br>from<br>district health boards that they had<br>really that have been profound for them<br>through the lockdown period was<br>how strong their relationships were with<br>ewe and their ability to act<br>quickly to to to support maori community<br>and you know it's interesting in hearing<br>that because there's nothing stopping<br>them doing that in fact it's an<br>obligation that's on them in the<br>in the legislation really so<br>i think that we've taken some lessons<br>from that about<br>most of the barriers to actually<br>addressing these issues<br>are a failure of our imagination they're<br>not<br>barriers uh they're not actual barriers<br>and<br>and most things are possible and we<br>should not<br>revert to back to where we were we need<br>to make sure we are<br>not um asking for permission as my boss<br>said to me<br>recently just keep doing stuff<br>until someone tells you to stop and if<br>it's working no one will tell you to<br>stop<br>that's probably true and<br>dr bloomfield thank you for being a<br>reliable point of information and<br>communication over these past couple of<br>months<br>how did your team decide on what<br>well uh well a couple of comments there<br>yes<br>um you don't want to over load people<br>with information<br>and you don't want to uh and you know<br>there was some commentary that we were<br>trying to control the narrative<br>so you you've got to be open and i guess<br>part of the<br>part of the challenge and the approach<br>we took was<br>we would share here we think is the key<br>information people need to know but in<br>making<br>ourselves available and i was making<br>myself available from early on<br>to answer questions about all sorts of<br>things<br>and in preparing as well as i could with<br>the latest information i could answer<br>those questions and sometimes if i knew<br>there was an emerging issue<br>i would front foot that and in in my<br>opening comments i would say i've read a<br>story about<br>x and i you know here is here is<br>a view on it or there's people have been<br>commenting there<br>at x then here is um i just want to<br>front foot that and<br>you will all recall that in fact i spent<br>several weeks<br>uh you know celebrating every time i got<br>through a um<br>a stand-up without a mention of ppe uh<br>because it became the the sort of term<br>du jour<br>and um uh there was a lot of interest in<br>it<br>uh and so very often it was trying to<br>front foot issues that i knew were<br>emerging to where there was concern or<br>where there was<br>public commentary on them<br>so you have to strike the right balance<br>by providing information that is<br>reassuring people but not providing<br>informa<br>not creating any perception that we're<br>trying to<br>the daily stand-ups were very effective<br>and would this possibly be something<br>that you may continue<br>across other health conditions perhaps<br>not daily though<br>and then a comment thank you for your<br>amazing work<br>well thanks thanks for the comment and i<br>want to just kick that straight to<br>the to my team and you know i've made<br>this comment<br>publicly a lot just being surrounded by<br>great people you know it's a team effort<br>and going i i'm still<br>really nervous before i go and do each<br>of those stand-ups every day<br>and i prepare well and my team give me<br>great support there so i need to<br>acknowledge them yeah we've talked about<br>how we can get that communication<br>much more regularly up from the ministry<br>on a whole range of issues<br>um i deliberately until at least the<br>last few days where it's been the right<br>thing to do<br>i've deliberately been stepping back for<br>a couple of reasons one is<br>that um and you will have seen some of<br>the the public kind of response to that<br>of<br>course when someone's out there very<br>visible every day through<br>what is uh you know a hugely significant<br>and symbolic event in everybody's lives<br>then<br>you you get this sort of um uh<br>uh the person can become the focus<br>rather than the issues so one of the<br>reasons i've stepped back is that<br>you know actually as i've always said<br>when i'm asked the question is<br>actually i i was just doing my job to<br>the best of my ability<br>and what people saw um through me and<br>through other things was<br>the public service doing its work<br>incredibly capably<br>uh and that's not usually seen or<br>understood<br>and here it was much more visible so<br>it's been a deliberate step back so it's<br>been<br>so there's been less focus on me as a<br>person and more just well that was<br>because of the time and circumstances<br>and i contin<br>was and continue to do my job but also<br>of course as we get closer to the<br>election<br>um i i started to and will continue to<br>field somewhat more political questions<br>which um i should they're not for me to<br>answer and so it's<br>it's much easier if i'm a little bit<br>away from from the from the um the daily<br>stand-ups but after the election<br>certainly<br>uh we'll be thinking and already are<br>thinking much more about<br>actually how can we communicate much and<br>use the platform we have created<br>through our response over the last few<br>months to tap into<br>the public's interest in uh in public<br>health issues<br>and i guess just the final comment here<br>because it's i think jermaine<br>um the thing that probably surprised me<br>or not surprised<br>me most but that i took away the biggest<br>learning for me from<br>the public's response and um<br>the way they they acted so collectively<br>during the lockdown was<br>how much importance actually at the end<br>of the day people place<br>on feeling safe and<br>uh and the government looking after<br>their safety and well-being they put<br>that above everything else and i think<br>that surprised<br>people and maybe it shouldn't be a<br>surprise but<br>above all else that people want to feel<br>safe<br>and they want to feel the government is<br>looking after their and their family and<br>their communities well-being<br>and that became really obvious and i<br>think there's something there for us we<br>should not<br>underestimate the strength of that<br>underlying<br>uh feeling that is out there across our<br>country<br>thank you and how have you managed your<br>own health and safety during this time<br>did you arrange to have the occasional<br>well well well people may recall it when<br>i did take a day off it became a<br>bit of a story in itself uh look it's<br>that's been a real challenge<br>um i have to say because and it's not<br>just for me but staff here have been<br>working<br>some some anyway been working really<br>long hours and looking after one's own<br>physical and mental well-being is<br>imperative um<br>actually and i think maybe many other<br>new zealanders found this the lockdown<br>was a real reminder to us<br>about how much pressure and stress we<br>put on ourselves<br>through the the how frantic we are in<br>our days<br>you know and how actually just slowing<br>down<br>and um and stopping and pausing<br>and listening to the birds and going for<br>a walk when we were forced to do it<br>was so good for uh our our well-being<br>now of course um<br>for many people who were in who were<br>essential workers in their families<br>it may not have been the same and i'll<br>acknowledge that however it's been<br>really i<br>think that was something that was<br>amazing learning for me<br>and we were again surveying the<br>population and uh<br>anxiety amongst those surveys uh anxiety<br>declined during the lockdown period<br>partly i think because of the certainty<br>it created for people but also<br>people's uh mental and physical<br>well-being<br>probably collectively did improve<br>i certainly loved the time when i wasn't<br>at work with my family<br>i can just remember warm<br>sunny lunches on the back steps hearing<br>nothing but birds and going for bike<br>rides with the whole family<br>being able to walk down the middle of<br>the road because there were no cars when<br>we were going for a walk<br>so that was helpful the last um few<br>weeks that the pressure's been pretty<br>intense and i did notice that<br>this the cumulative um intensity of it<br>had started to<br>get to me and i came into wick one day<br>and i didn't have a stand up and i had a<br>really light day but every time i looked<br>at my diary i could feel my anxiety<br>levels just going almost straight<br>spheric because there was this<br>anticipation of i had to stand up or<br>something and i realized i needed to<br>just pause<br>and uh and take some time out took a few<br>days over over queen's birthday but<br>you know you that cumulative impact of<br>high cortisol levels<br>of of the uncertainty of grappling with<br>really significant issues<br>does catch up on us all no matter how<br>resilient we are and we do have to<br>maintain our<br>own uh physical and mental well-being it<br>was a great reminder and emotional and<br>who came up with the bubble concept i<br>wish i knew<br>the closest i've got to it is actually a<br>letter that we sent to the university of<br>otago uh i sent to<br>the vice chancellor and in that letter<br>it suggested that<br>um dr tristram who's a a researcher and<br>disability uh<br>researcher and advocate maori researcher<br>in wellington here<br>had come up with it i'm not sure but it<br>was i think it's<br>been a fantastic concept and we've seen<br>other countries also<br>okay uh what public health communication<br>well it goes a bit beyond public health<br>uh communication advice i think<br>um look i've just come back to those um<br>those key things about uh<br>you know what worked well for him for us<br>here was that<br>consistency of the messaging and<br>uh establishing that that trust<br>relationship with the public so that<br>even if the news wasn't that flash and<br>you know you um people will recall when<br>we went to alert level four people have<br>to trust<br>us when we'd say the numbers will keep<br>going up but after<br>a week to ten days they will start to<br>come down and of course we're all<br>holding our breaths although those of us<br>and there'll be some on the line who<br>those of you who are communicable<br>disease specialists we know that<br>actually um<br>if you do it right that this is what<br>will happen so for the us and it's not<br>just the us i think it's<br>it's it's really that that critical<br>thing about<br>that strong consistent um and<br>trustworthy political leadership is so<br>critical uh<br>to both a successful and an unsuccessful<br>response<br>and of course you need politicians then<br>who are genuinely driven<br>by a desire a foremost a paramount<br>desire<br>to to secure the well-being and safety<br>of their citizens<br>and not some political or other personal<br>agenda<br>thank you and i think we'll just end<br>with two comments uh<br>and you don't need to respond uh this is<br>just another note to say thank you dr<br>bloomfield for being a true leader<br>during these times<br>you've been an excellent communicator<br>with a reassuring presence<br>and as three kiwis of five million thank<br>you<br>also just want to let you know how much<br>of an impact you and your team have had<br>on our younger new zealanders<br>your communication style has been key in<br>comforting our children<br>thank you well thank you for the<br>feedback and and once again<br>thanks for the opportunity to<br>participate in the seminar today i hope<br>that<br>that's been of interest and uh really<br>appreciate your your ongoing support and<br>i'll pass the
