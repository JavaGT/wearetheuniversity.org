writing<br>and post the answers up on the ogi<br>website page<br>our first speaker today is associate<br>professor tony walls<br>he was a public health sorry he was a<br>pediatric<br>specialist an infectious disease<br>specialist in the department of<br>pediatrics<br>at the university of otago in<br>christchurch<br>tony is going to discuss children and<br>covert 19.<br>tony<br>thanks for the introduction jackie and<br>welcome and good afternoon to everyone<br>who's joined us thank you for tuning in<br>so as jackie mentioned i'm an infectious<br>diseases specialist<br>and pediatrician who works here in<br>christchurch<br>i'm going to be talking about covert 19<br>and<br>children in particular and i think<br>probably there's been a few<br>misunderstandings or misinformation<br>about the role<br>of covert 19 and children from early on<br>in this pandemic<br>so hopefully we'll touch on a few of<br>those and<br>uh i'll also be touching on uh<br>looking at it from a child health focus<br>on this pandemic and how we manage it<br>just before i get started i'd like to<br>acknowledge some of the help i've had<br>with some of the slides in this<br>presentation mavis<br>duncanson at the new zealand pediatric<br>surveillance units provided me with some<br>data along the way and also i've had<br>some uh<br>help with some of the research that i'm<br>going to be presenting which i'll<br>acknowledge as we go along<br>so if there was a take-home message from<br>this talk it's that children are<br>different<br>this is one of the reasons why some of<br>us really enjoy working in pediatrics<br>and down the years down the decades<br>pediatricians have always been teaching<br>their students<br>that children are not just little adults<br>and i think covert 19 has really<br>highlighted this<br>nicely um uh<br>this is kind of the general picture i<br>think many people have<br>of children in relation to infectious<br>diseases and virus infections in<br>particular<br>we think of them as little virus<br>machines that spread<br>disease throughout their kindergartens<br>their preschools and they bring those<br>home<br>and persistently snotty and passing<br>around viruses<br>and of course for many infections that's<br>exactly true<br>for influenza is the prime example where<br>children are the main vectors of spread<br>within communities often<br>but the big point i want to make today<br>is that for cover 19<br>things are very different and we can't<br>use that same approach to children<br>and our same understanding of how<br>things how diseases particularly viral<br>infections are spread<br>amongst children just doesn't apply so<br>we need a different look at it and<br>there's a different approach<br>and of course much of our pandemic<br>planet<br>done prior to this pandemic was with<br>influenza in mind<br>so many of the steps that we've taken<br>along the way may not have been entirely<br>appropriate<br>given the different paradigm we have<br>with covert 19 in children so i'll go<br>through a little bit<br>shortly so right at the start of this<br>pandemic i watched this<br>webinar from it was broadcast<br>on the australasian society of<br>infectious through the australian<br>society of infectious diseases<br>and it had some really interesting<br>comments so dr elwood<br>is was the co-leader of the joint<br>mission<br>from the world health organization into<br>china uh he's a gentleman who is<br>canadian i understand<br>he's worked for many decades in<br>infectious diseases with the world<br>health organization and been involved<br>with many<br>epidemics such as ebola and sars a<br>vastly experienced clinician<br>and epidemiologist and it was quite<br>enlightening right at the beginning<br>to listen to his talk and<br>i guess the main thing that struck me uh<br>was firstly that this is someone who had<br>boots on the ground the<br>the joint mission had been to china<br>they'd been talking to people<br>who had been experiencing an epidemic<br>and a large outbreak and they'd be so<br>they were seeing it for themselves<br>and these are the main messages that<br>came through from that tool firstly the<br>very first thing with this<br>is not influenza everything that was<br>happening on the ground was very<br>different from an influenza outbreak<br>and equally it was it was significantly<br>different from<br>the previous experience that we'd had<br>with sars<br>and in relation to children their main<br>message was that<br>things were different again so that the<br>the severity of disease that children<br>were experiencing<br>the way it was transmitted to and to<br>children and where they were obtaining<br>it<br>was very different from things that had<br>happened in previous epidemics<br>so what i'm going to talk about today<br>i'm going to talk a little bit about the<br>epidemiology of<br>covert 19 in children we're going to<br>take a look at this concept of of<br>schools and are they a safe place for<br>children to be<br>i'm going to touch on a little bit on<br>severe disease<br>and then i'm going to talk about from a<br>sort of more from a parent's perspective<br>what parents are thinking about covert<br>19.<br>so if we just start with the new zealand<br>epidemiology<br>and this is just slightly different from<br>what you may have heard earlier in the<br>week so<br>there haven't been any hospital<br>admissions for children in new zealand<br>with confirmed covert 19 infection<br>now last night an email catching me up<br>that there has actually been one child<br>under the age of 15 who was<br>admitted to hospital they tested<br>negative the covert 19 but were listed<br>as a probable case because<br>they were in contact with some uh proven<br>cases<br>but in general there haven't been any<br>children so pediatricians around the<br>country<br>have been sitting waiting for the coming<br>tsunami<br>of severe infections at alert<br>and and with infection protection<br>controls uh stuff in place and<br>children's wards<br>up and down the country have generally<br>been incredibly quiet<br>particularly quiet for this time of year<br>when we're usually expecting a surge of<br>disease<br>and if you look at the actual numbers<br>you can see here that in children<br>under 10 years of age across new zealand<br>these are up to date<br>figures there's only been 10 confirmed<br>cases<br>and another 27 which are listed as<br>probable cases<br>and then in the older age group up to 15<br>years of age<br>29 confirmed cases and 18<br>probable cases so very low numbers and<br>as you can see on the right we've done<br>exceptionally well in new zealand in<br>terms of restricting<br>the the spread of code 19 as you've<br>heard<br>in previous talks so what about what's<br>happening in the rest of the world<br>um we could have taken examples from<br>anywhere really in either the major<br>country because there's lots of data now<br>available but i've chosen to go with<br>information from the united states where<br>of clearly now there's a lot of<br>transmission<br>and a lot of data available<br>so this was again pretty early on in the<br>epidemic<br>that this was published<br>and it's covering data from february and<br>the early part of march in the united<br>states looking at the different<br>age groups of infections<br>and the outcomes of those in terms of<br>hospitalization if you look at the age<br>groups along the bottom i guess the<br>first thing to notice<br>is that they're not in equal brackets so<br>the ones on the right are in 10 year<br>increments the ones on the left are in<br>20 or even more increments so it doesn't<br>quite fit<br>this is number of hospitalizations on<br>the vertical axis and the age groups<br>along the bottom well the striking thing<br>right from the start of this epidemic<br>was that children<br>were just not affected very often and<br>you can see here<br>even up to age 20 the 20th birthday<br>there was very few children being<br>admitted hospital in the united states<br>and obviously uh no deaths and<br>no icu admissions at that time<br>now if we look uh again similar sort of<br>time frame<br>a little bit later perhaps and this time<br>this is<br>uh confirmed cases who have tested<br>positive<br>for covert 19. you can see the older you<br>are<br>the population the rate of disease in<br>the population rate of positivity<br>is much greater but in those children<br>even up to the 18th birthday<br>the rates of disease are incredibly low<br>now i've deliberately chosen ones from<br>early in the<br>epidemic in the u.s but if you look at<br>ones from later the pattern<br>seems to be very similar now one of the<br>one of the things that people<br>have said is that maybe we're just not<br>testing children<br>so i thought i would include the next<br>slide just<br>to uh illustrate that there are some<br>places where there has been a lot of<br>testing and they still found<br>that very few cases of testing positive<br>so this is from philadelphia the<br>children's health<br>hospital network in philadelphia<br>uh and it covers the time range age<br>range<br>sorry the time scale from very early on<br>in the epidemic<br>to recently and if you see<br>on the vertical axis you can see the<br>number of daily tests that were done<br>and on the percentage that are positive<br>and the dark bars are showing the<br>positive test the lighter bars are the<br>ones that have tested negative<br>and this is a population not just from a<br>hospital network so in patients but also<br>including drive-through clinics where<br>people are getting tested<br>so presumably most of the people coming<br>through drive food clinics and through<br>ed<br>uh the emergency department were<br>symptomatic<br>or at least worried that they might have<br>covet and you can see<br>the total percentage of positive cases<br>positive tests is very low and in fact<br>this is<br>taking children all the while children<br>young adults all the way up to 21<br>and but if you take the group of<br>children who are under five<br>it's even lower than that so the<br>percentage was under<br>four percent positive so the younger<br>they are the less likely they are to be<br>positive<br>and but overall a low rate of positivity<br>considering the amount of transmission<br>so this next slide is really looking is<br>from china and this is one of the first<br>case reports that came<br>out of what was happening children who<br>were admitted to hospital<br>and they tested over 2 000 children<br>at the wuhan children's hospital and 172<br>of those were positive and this is a<br>letter that was describing<br>the outcomes and characteristics of<br>those children who were tested positive<br>you can see firstly that a large<br>proportion of children<br>who were in hospital had either<br>asymptomatic infection<br>or a mild what's described as upper<br>respiratory tract infection<br>65 of the children had pneumonia as part<br>of their presentation but the<br>interesting part about that is it was<br>very mild<br>if it was described as pneumonia so they<br>may have had x-ray changes<br>but they were only mildly affected only<br>four children<br>had oxygen saturations below a level<br>that we would give supplemental oxygen<br>for<br>which is remarkable really and only<br>three required intention<br>admission to the pediatric intensive<br>care unit and and<br>this is in the winter months in a large<br>children's hospital<br>and normally there would be quite a few<br>children being embedded with respiratory<br>disease at that time<br>so the conclusion from all of this was<br>again what we said at the start that if<br>children are getting infection<br>they're generally milder and there's<br>very few cases<br>where they have severe disease but the<br>thing that really struck me about this<br>data thing that i found most interesting<br>was the exposure information so if we<br>look just down at here you can see that<br>more than 90 of children who were<br>admitted to hospital<br>were thought to have acquired it within<br>a family cluster so<br>most likely to have required it from an<br>adult so this is not a situation where<br>you've got children passing on to other<br>children in the community<br>and almost all of the the cases<br>are getting it presumably from an adult<br>in the household<br>and if you look at data from the us at<br>the similar sort of time<br>remarkably similar numbers over 90<br>of children where it was documented<br>where they got the infection from<br>it had come from in the family it would<br>come from a family cluster rather than<br>out in the community and again<br>this again highlights something that's<br>very different from what you might see<br>with influenza disease so what does this<br>mean for school children<br>in new zealand because that's the kind<br>of question that most parents have been<br>asking<br>along the way so i'm just going to look<br>at what's happened what the data we<br>have in new zealand and a key study from<br>new south wales which is<br>i think helpful in this area so this is<br>the new zealander firstly there's been<br>no school clusters in preschools or<br>primary schools<br>and when the when the plan was to send<br>children back to school into preschool<br>there was clearly a lot of concern and<br>worry from<br>staff in those areas that they might be<br>at risk because of children<br>if you look at the cluster that happened<br>the first one was probably a misnomer<br>calling the cluster these clusters<br>because either they haven't happened in<br>schools or they haven't<br>been many of them so there was one child<br>who was at school for a day<br>symptomatic at logan park high school<br>they tested a large number of children<br>in that school<br>who were potentially in contact with<br>that child and there was no transmission<br>then there's what was gets referred to<br>as the morris college cluster<br>and again this is a bit of a misnomer<br>most of<br>there was about 92 cases uh overall<br>in that cluster but only 36 of those<br>were children<br>and these are all uh high school age<br>children<br>the index cases uh were both teachers<br>and it's thought that much of the<br>transmission occurred either<br>at a social event that was organized and<br>associated with the school but not at<br>school<br>or within the families when people who<br>had acquired diseases<br>had gone home there was only one<br>suggestion of a case where a child had<br>given it to another child<br>in a school setting there had been some<br>other cases that suggested that<br>children have given to other children in<br>a household setting<br>so although it's called a school cluster<br>and that was the impression that was<br>uh out there in the media i guess<br>majority of cases in that cluster were<br>not in fact children they were adults<br>and the majority the vast majority had<br>not acquired it<br>at the school so this is a key study<br>that<br>was coming out in april<br>from the national center of immunization<br>research and surveillance in<br>sydney in new south wales um and this<br>is a detailed study looking at<br>transmission within school so there were<br>18<br>individuals who were identified testing<br>positive with covert 19 from 15<br>different schools<br>and what the public health units did is<br>did some close<br>contact investigations of over 850<br>close contacts of these individuals so<br>nine of those individuals were were<br>adults who work in the school nine of<br>those individuals<br>were children and<br>no adult contacted disease from a child<br>and that was actually really important<br>because at the time<br>i understand australia and ongoing in<br>places like victoria<br>there were concerns from uh<br>unions and people representing staff<br>that it was dangerous for them to be at<br>school in the pandemic<br>but in fact in new south wales it seemed<br>that adults were safe from the children<br>at that point<br>i'm just going to look at the primary<br>school cases<br>and this is a diagram that sort of<br>explains what was happening so you can<br>see<br>in the primary school there was only one<br>case it was a secondary case<br>and that had come from a staff member in<br>that school who was covered positive<br>in the other schools you can see most of<br>the cases most of the<br>positive cases were adults or staff<br>members that worked in the school when<br>there was only one that was a child<br>and there was no child to child<br>transmission<br>within the school there was only one<br>other case they identified<br>in the secondary school and this had<br>actually been someone who may have<br>connect<br>developed disease with uh connection at<br>the school but in primary schools there<br>was no<br>transmission so overall out of you know<br>well over 800 close contacts of children<br>who had been in schools<br>known to be covered positive at the time<br>the transmission rate was incredibly low<br>so that's actually really reassuring so<br>and<br>around that time professor phil hill and<br>i put out a statement just as schools<br>were going to be looking towards opening<br>up in new zealand<br>saying that we thought the schools were<br>as safe as they'd ever been<br>it was kind of coincidental we hadn't<br>seen that data when we put the statement<br>together and our<br>discussion was really based on<br>information that was already out there<br>but it<br>worked well so i just wanted to talk<br>briefly<br>about the things that are scaring<br>parents and and others<br>and one of those is this severe disease<br>that has been<br>presented across the globe sometimes<br>talked about as<br>kawasaki-like disease although there are<br>significant differences from kawasaki<br>disease<br>this is a systemic inflammatory syndrome<br>for one of a better term uh<br>which may be related to covert 19.<br>people aren't really sure the key thing<br>is that it's rare<br>uh and a recent case report from the uk<br>they only<br>would identify 58 possible cases<br>and that's out of a group or a<br>population of something like<br>11 million children across the uk uh and<br>many of those cases actually<br>were would fit diagnostic criteria for<br>kawasaki disease so it's<br>first thing is it's very rare it is a<br>severe phenomenon<br>in terms of the individual children can<br>be fairly sick<br>but i guess the main issue and problem<br>with this was that<br>a warning was put out over twitter right<br>up front<br>without going through any scientific<br>analysis and so it spread around the<br>globe<br>as a scary thing that was happening to<br>children and people are seeing it and<br>think it's an incredibly common<br>phenomenon<br>obviously with no hospitalised cases in<br>new zealand we haven't seen any of this<br>but i think it's learned large in the<br>media and enlarging parents thoughts<br>so uh just prior to the time when<br>schools were about to start up<br>we put together a survey because we were<br>concerned that there were that<br>parents were really worried about<br>sending their children back to school<br>um this was a survey sent out by<br>facebook we got<br>over uh 1100 responses<br>and thank you to anyone who might be<br>watching this webcast who's<br>participated in that survey and we asked<br>parents of school-aged children a number<br>of questions<br>around how scared they were of covert<br>for their children and other<br>other things that have been going on<br>with their children but um this<br>i'll just hit on the key things here so<br>nearly 80 percent thought that if<br>if we were in a situation which we<br>weren't at the time but if there was<br>widespread community transmission<br>80 percent thought that it's likely or<br>very likely that their child would catch<br>covert if they were at school<br>more realistic to what was happening<br>because this is when there was very few<br>cases in new zealand and schools were<br>about to open<br>but nearly 15 were extremely all very<br>worried<br>that with no even with no community<br>transmission their child was going to<br>catch covert if they sent them back to<br>school<br>more than 50 in total were somewhat<br>worried<br>that their child would catch covert if<br>they were at school so<br>from my point of view it seemed like<br>there was a big disconnect between<br>the public health messaging that was<br>saying it was all of okay<br>the science that was saying that<br>actually transmission is<br>unlikely and the level of worry<br>amongst parents along the way um<br>so uh and i should another thing i<br>should say is that<br>uh the other thing that came out of this<br>survey is that something like 80<br>of parents would be prepared to<br>vaccinate their child if there was a<br>brand new vaccine around<br>they'd be prepared to vaccinate their<br>child against covert and i think that<br>really does express the level of worry<br>that was out there in the community<br>so i guess the big question is what<br>harms have we done through our infection<br>control measures<br>to along the way when there's very<br>little risk of<br>of childhood disease there's certainly<br>been<br>a lot fewer gp presentations hospital<br>presentation which i'll show you some<br>data on a minute<br>we had an immunization coverage which is<br>generally really really good in new<br>zealand but in the last couple of years<br>it's just been declining a little bit<br>and having children lock down certainly<br>hasn't helped that<br>and there'll be those that have been<br>avoiding it clearly there's been a lot<br>of miss school that's going to have<br>implications for many students<br>and there's also been mental health<br>challenges which i think are largely<br>unrecognized and i'll cover that a<br>little in a minute but i think the main<br>thing is that<br>any impact that's been had on child<br>health all across this has really been<br>likely to be the greatest and<br>disadvantaged communities they're the<br>ones that are least likely to access<br>services normally<br>they're the ones who are least likely to<br>have or more likely to have their<br>children missing school so<br>uh i think it's going to be<br>disproportionately effective across the<br>schools<br>here's some data from christchurch ed<br>and thank you to laura joyce for helping<br>with us so<br>this is hospital admissions for children<br>under a sorry emergency department<br>presentation for children under 15 years<br>of age<br>the rolling averages between the red<br>lines over a 10-year period and the<br>predicted<br>off to the right-hand side of the graph<br>and the baseline in the blue<br>number of attendances with ed along the<br>way you can see<br>just as things were locked down dropped<br>off dramatically<br>and remained very low right through<br>level three and even through most of<br>level two actually they<br>remained really well now much of this<br>can be explained by<br>less transmission of infections in the<br>community<br>lots of other different presentations<br>but actually uh there are some more<br>worrying things in amongst these<br>statistics they<br>normally we'd have they were fit in in<br>the month before lockdown there were 15<br>presentations that were coded<br>for mental health diagnosis or suicidal<br>ideation in young people<br>and in the lockdown time there was zero<br>and normally we would have a lot more<br>presentations there so<br>it it does make me worry that we've been<br>missing a whole lot of<br>uh presentations of children that would<br>normally be<br>finally i just just a teaser really some<br>of you may have heard this on the sunday<br>morning program<br>where there was some relationship<br>some data suggesting an association<br>between male pattern baldness<br>and androgens and uh<br>the extent to which people are affected<br>by covered backed up by some data from<br>italy where<br>uh men were much more likely to end up<br>in icu<br>uh in spain where men admitted were most<br>80<br>of them were had male pattern baldness<br>it's kind of intriguing i don't know<br>what to make of it<br>uh it's worth having a listen to um<br>and i kind of wonder whether that may be<br>one thing that may<br>explain partly why children aren't uh<br>getting this disease it's a big<br>unresolved question as to why children<br>don't get this disease as much<br>i don't have the answers but that's an<br>interesting thing that i thought i'd<br>just chuck it<br>so just to summarize the big message<br>take our message is this is not<br>influenza<br>and in particular in children the<br>severity of disease that children get<br>the transmission dynamics are very very<br>different in children<br>and i think the way we structure public<br>health policy needs<br>to be cognizant of that so that we're<br>not restricting or limiting<br>children's access to schooling access to<br>health care and just finally<br>children do spread disease they do have<br>some disgusting habits sometimes of<br>which they're likely to pick things up<br>but certainly not with covert and if<br>those who are looking for that quote<br>that i had at the start that's from<br>oscar wilde<br>thank you very much your time i'm happy<br>thank you tony yes we have<br>quite a few questions i'll go through<br>them in the order that they were<br>received in<br>firstly has they been in a consideration<br>given to the fact that high percentages<br>of children were in lockdown<br>and therefore more likely to contract<br>covert from family<br>also fewer respiratory hospitalizations<br>due to less pollution in cities<br>so certainly that data i showed you from<br>china<br>it was the new year's holiday for most<br>of that and so children would not have<br>been in schools<br>at the time so there's no question<br>that's likely to have contributed<br>the flip side of that is probably places<br>like singapore<br>where early on in the epidemic when they<br>were controlling disease schools were<br>open they took they took a deliberate<br>move<br>while they were restricting movements of<br>people and<br>closing the borders they kept the<br>schools open<br>and i haven't seen any specific data<br>out of singapore but i have had contact<br>with dale fisher who<br>is one of the leading public health<br>people over there<br>and he said that anecdotally they just<br>haven't had any clusters that have been<br>based around preschools or schools<br>so i think it actually is a real<br>phenomenon that<br>children aren't picking it up even when<br>there are schooling other data that<br>might<br>back that up would be places where<br>they've actively gone looking like in<br>iceland<br>where they did whole population surveys<br>of asymptomatic people and<br>when they tested a raft of<br>children under the age of 10 not one<br>case was positive for covert 19.<br>so um there is a fair bit of data<br>suggesting that what we're seeing is a<br>real phenomenon<br>i'm not really available able to comment<br>on pollution in cities really it's not<br>my area of expertise so<br>we might move on thank you<br>what is your view on covered in children<br>being an asymptomatic<br>gastric infection are there any studies<br>looking at detecting size copper 2 in<br>stool samples in children<br>so there are case reports of it being<br>detected<br>in children many of you may remember<br>with<br>sars the original disease there was<br>there was<br>uh considerable concern about<br>transmission<br>in stools uh the only studies i've<br>really seen have been around detection<br>where people have gone looking<br>installed in infants and children who<br>have been hospitalized and it's been<br>confirmed that a small number of them do<br>have it detectable it's<br>not in the list of symptoms and some of<br>these larger case series it's not a<br>prominent feature<br>and i suspect that it's probably<br>unlikely<br>to be a significant cause of<br>transmission either<br>in hospitals or outside of hospitals<br>there seems to be low numbers in<br>children but the young adult group has<br>high numbers of positives<br>is there an age where this swaps over<br>i don't think anyone's got a clear<br>cut-off age for that but it's exactly<br>right in our data in new zealand and<br>other countries that you're more likely<br>to get it in if you're in that sort of<br>15 to 20<br>age bracket and i'm not sure any of us<br>have<br>an explanation for that other than<br>uh the type of activities that those<br>older children are likely to be involved<br>in<br>socially and that's really speculation<br>to be honest<br>i guess most people still<br>have when they've categorized things<br>have shown sort of up to that age<br>20 even though there's more disease or<br>infections being detected in the older<br>group of that<br>there's still very few hospitalizations<br>at that time so<br>we have time for one last question what<br>do you make of the covert 19 situation<br>in the u.s<br>specifically with regard to reopening of<br>schools<br>i think the reopening of schools is a<br>really challenging thing it was quite an<br>easy decision<br>in new zealand<br>and it's a difficult one<br>i think that from a child purely child<br>health perspective<br>i.e what's the risk of a child getting<br>covert disease even in a high incidence<br>country i think<br>um that the risk is still pretty low of<br>them obtaining it<br>in a school from another child and so<br>you might argue that<br>the downside of having close schools in<br>terms of child health<br>might be worse than keeping them all at<br>home<br>we know the children are the drivers and<br>communities so<br>that's an argument for keeping schools<br>open and we know that it's possible<br>to contain the disease in a population<br>like<br>singapore with schools open<br>i guess the us has such widespread<br>transmission at the moment<br>it's challenging the argument for<br>closing schools<br>is in my view a population level<br>argument<br>whereby if you're going to have lockdown<br>it's pretty hard to have really strict<br>lockdown while you're sending your<br>children to school<br>and so from a public health messaging<br>point of view closing the schools is<br>advantageous but if you're looking at<br>from a child health point of view<br>i think the arguments for closing<br>schools are<br>not that good and in fact with the<br>original sars epidemic<br>there was a paper put out estimating the<br>impact of closing schools at that time<br>and it was felt that<br>the actual impact on reduction in<br>community transmission by closing<br>schools<br>thank you tony unfortunately that's all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
