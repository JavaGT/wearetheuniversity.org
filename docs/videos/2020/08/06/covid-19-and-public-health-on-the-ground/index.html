two<br>different speakers<br>dr debra harris will speak on contact<br>tracing and the view from nurses on the<br>ground<br>and then dr fiona mack will speak about<br>consumers experiences<br>of primary health care during level<br>three and for lockdown<br>for those of you who are joining for the<br>first time i'm professor gregor costa<br>dean of the wellington faculty of health<br>at victoria university wellington<br>and i'll be moderating today's session<br>we hope for a lively discussion with our<br>panelists and we'll be using a<br>q a function if you'd like to submit a<br>question<br>sometime during the panel presentations<br>we'll aim to answer as many questions as<br>possible<br>and the webinar will run for around one<br>hour<br>now if you want to ask questions it<br>works like this<br>if you move your cursor to the bottom of<br>the screen<br>you'll see a image<br>with marked q a if you click on that<br>it brings up the q a box and you can<br>then type your question<br>into the box and it becomes visible to<br>everybody<br>people can then vote on it in the side<br>area and those questions with the most<br>votes will<br>come up to the top and we'll take those<br>questions first<br>when it comes to question time we're<br>going to have the two presentations one<br>after the other<br>questions will come in and then we'll do<br>the questions for the panelists<br>after both presenters have presented<br>and we'll keep any unanswered questions<br>for our presenters to<br>consider answering afterwards if they<br>can<br>so let me introduce today's panelists<br>so the first presenter is dr debra<br>harris<br>deborah is a neonatal nurse practitioner<br>and clinically focused researcher<br>she's new zealand's first nurse<br>practitioner<br>her doctoral work focused on the<br>management and treatment of neonatal<br>hypoglycemia<br>that's to say low blood sugar in babies<br>the randomized control trial the sugar<br>babies study<br>showed that oral dextrose gel is an<br>effective and safe treatment<br>for neonatal hypoglycemia<br>debra has since published extensively<br>about care and management<br>of babies at risk of low blood sugar<br>and and the effects on their later<br>development<br>debris research has changed the<br>treatment for babies<br>and their families worldwide now<br>importantly for this<br>webinar deborah was involved in setting<br>up the ministry of health's<br>contact tracing system and was posted<br>there for two months<br>during lockdown so we're looking forward<br>to hearing what<br>deborah has to say she's going to talk<br>about<br>contact tracing and the nursing response<br>to covert 19.<br>she'll cover off how contact tracing was<br>established<br>what went well and what didn't go well<br>challenges with contact tracing then and<br>now<br>and the nursing response to cover 19.<br>welcome deborah<br>thank you and we look forward to hearing<br>what you have to say<br>thank you gregor arta maria everybody<br>and thank you for the opportunity to<br>take part<br>in this webinar regarding covert 19<br>on the ground as grigor has said i'm a<br>nurse practitioner<br>and this was one of the reasons that i<br>was asked on the 18th of march by the<br>chief nurse within the ministry of<br>health<br>to give a hand perhaps for three days<br>dip<br>to help stand up the national close<br>contact service<br>there were five senior nurses asked to<br>help with this<br>and my colleagues were all nurses from<br>capital coast dhb<br>today i'm going to help share a story<br>with you<br>about how we stood up the national close<br>contact tracing service<br>as you are aware rapid case detection<br>and contact tracing combined with basic<br>health care measures<br>are over 90 effective against covert 19<br>at a population level<br>making this much as effective as many<br>vaccines<br>during the early part of our covert 19<br>outbreak each of the 12 public health<br>units were undertaking contact tracing<br>which of course is part of their normal<br>functions<br>however largely this is for outbreaks<br>such as listeria like we saw<br>in tauranga late last week things like<br>tuberculosis the point that i'm making<br>here is that<br>these outbreaks tend to be an awful lot<br>smaller than what we have seen<br>with covert some of the public health<br>units were completely overwhelmed by<br>workload<br>and you will recall that we had large<br>clusters initially in southland and in<br>auckland<br>therefore the lack of capacity within<br>the public health units<br>was limiting our ability to conduct<br>rapid contact racing<br>and therefore there was a government<br>decision made<br>to have a national close contact service<br>so that's the reason it started<br>we were joined we joined a team within<br>the ministry of health<br>which included public health physicians<br>protection officers<br>health managers data analysts software<br>specialists<br>people that wrote software policy<br>writers and managers who understood the<br>ministry<br>of or the machinery if you will of<br>government<br>we were also very fortunate to be joined<br>from by people from agriculture<br>those that had been involved in the<br>national contact tracing<br>for the micro micro plasma bulbous<br>outbreak which was in 2019<br>and while there is a massive difference<br>between cattle and humans<br>the experience of contact tracing cattle<br>and talking to farmers<br>gave us valuable insight and helped us<br>to stand up the services promptly<br>on the afternoon of the 19th of march we<br>were making our first<br>calls to those that had been in close<br>contact<br>with people who have been diagnosed with<br>covert 19.<br>our nursing team had many<br>responsibilities<br>perhaps the most important one was<br>writing the scripts<br>to inform the phone calls for the public<br>it was essential that our communication<br>was current<br>clear concise and reflected the messages<br>that were also being given<br>in the daily updates from dr ashley<br>bloomfield<br>and our prime minister jacinda ardern<br>the ministry of health website became<br>our center of truth<br>and we quickly established a method of<br>discovering when that was updated<br>we developed a three-call approach and<br>largely we based this on<br>the irish model as the irish people were<br>a little bit ahead of us<br>we quickly reviewed international models<br>for contact tracing<br>and also the recommendations from the<br>world health organization<br>i'm going to tell you a little bit about<br>the calls now<br>call one was to provide a member of the<br>public with confirmation of the<br>diagnosis of covid19<br>and where to get help and support call 2<br>was to investigate where a member of the<br>public had been<br>in situations so places or with people<br>um for greater than 15 minutes within at<br>the two meter distance<br>so this was sort of the sleuth phone<br>call if you will and this<br>phone tool often took a long time<br>and call 3 was to confirm that a member<br>of the public<br>had been in close contact with somebody<br>who was positive for covert 19<br>and to inform that person that they<br>needed to self-isolate for the<br>required 14 days because we were the<br>national close contact<br>but sometimes we were involved in all<br>three calls of course<br>just to put call 3 into some context for<br>you all<br>it would commonly go like this i would<br>call a member of the public<br>explain who i was and why i was calling<br>confirm that i was actually talking to<br>the right person<br>i would then explain that they had been<br>in contact with somebody who was known<br>to have covert 19<br>i wouldn't identify that person and i<br>would talk to them about the importance<br>of self-isolating<br>since the date of exposure and i would<br>seek<br>understanding that the member of public<br>understood what i was saying<br>we always knew the date of exposure and<br>the early data collection sheets that we<br>designed<br>included an algorithm which calculated<br>the number of days<br>and the end date for self-isolation that<br>was required<br>and we did this in order to maintain<br>consistency and<br>reduce any risk of error we would also<br>provide health care uh advice<br>and support and welfare advice um<br>also about how to reduce the spread of<br>covert 19.<br>and we would talk about getting in front<br>of the virus that that was the sort of<br>mantra that we used<br>we talked to members of the public about<br>the importance of seeking<br>health care promptly if they became<br>unwell and we encourage people to<br>contact the ministry of social<br>development for welfare support<br>and the mental health support line<br>after all this information was provided<br>and felt understood<br>i would then ask for some demographic<br>data<br>i frequently found myself saying i know<br>this is a lot of information<br>how about you get a cuppa call your<br>family and someone will call you back<br>to get some more details about where<br>you've been and when that call<br>happens why don't you grab your diary or<br>your phone if you've got a calendar<br>and have that handy so that the message<br>i'm wanting to give you now is that<br>every time we had<br>a call 3 it left with the confirmation<br>to the member of public<br>that someone else was going to call soon<br>and often they would be seeking clarity<br>after that call<br>all three scripts were developed using a<br>nursing care approach<br>that being culturally sensitive<br>providing reassurance about health and<br>welfare<br>and directions about where to get help<br>if it was required<br>my role was constantly evolving<br>from making calls to teaching nurses and<br>other healthcare professionals about<br>making calls managing complex calls<br>consulting with airlines police customs<br>intelligence services both within new<br>zealand<br>and beyond i also was heavily involved<br>in supporting those making the calls<br>providing pastoral care in fact it was<br>very very stressful for clinicians<br>calling people<br>and of course another very important<br>role was revising the scripts and<br>protocols for the covert 19 break<br>outbreak as it continued to evolve and<br>the messages changed and the needs of<br>the public changed<br>as i said we started making calls on the<br>19th of march with five nurses and<br>within six days we'd gone to a capacity<br>of 150 callers which included both<br>nurses and other health care providers<br>so it was a phenomenal amount of<br>education that we also did<br>following this i was asked to move into<br>the planning and capacity<br>leadership team and my roles within that<br>team in court<br>included providing clinical advice<br>working collaboratively with public<br>health doctors<br>and writing policy to ensure that the<br>national close contact service<br>was underpinned by our foundational<br>document trinity of waitangi<br>a quality insurance program was embedded<br>within it<br>the data was safe protected and cleaned<br>and along with all policies and<br>procedures for the service<br>we ended with a capacity plan that was<br>written which enabled the service<br>to contact up to ten thousand members of<br>public of the public<br>in any given day should that be required<br>and i'm confident that the national<br>close contact service that's currently<br>in place<br>is able to protect us in atrium new<br>zealand<br>well i think one of the things that<br>really worked was that<br>nurses were there at the beginning<br>nurses are people who are able to<br>establish a therapeutic relationship<br>with somebody very quickly<br>and relationships is what makes nursing<br>practice<br>really good or not so good and<br>nurses are experts in collaboration<br>these skills allowed us to work in a<br>multi-disciplinary team<br>and find solutions promptly and to my<br>mind it's one reason why we were able to<br>stand up the service so quickly<br>the other thing that i think was<br>important is that nurses are trained to<br>perform well in a crisis<br>sometimes leading them and other times<br>following<br>being part of a team in fact<br>sometimes a nurse in a healthcare<br>situation is invisible<br>but never ever absent<br>in this outbreak nurses were very<br>visible<br>everywhere helping the public and the<br>public were relying on nursing<br>as a neonatal intensive care nurse i<br>likened the feelings of those first few<br>weeks to feeling like we were in a<br>continuous<br>resuscitation in a constantly changing<br>environment<br>and this meant to us that self-care was<br>very important<br>both for both for us as i've said but<br>also for our colleagues<br>and the other members that were helping<br>us our leadership was<br>calm clear consistent and while not<br>always feeling like this<br>what we wanted to give to everybody<br>was for everybody to know in our team to<br>know and feel<br>what things might have made it easier<br>for us<br>well for me the biggest problem in those<br>early days was the way that we received<br>data<br>so um the police were helping us and<br>they were doing an amazing job a really<br>marvelous job but those early days we<br>didn't have<br>access to health care data um and so it<br>was<br>difficult to be able to track people<br>easily and quickly<br>it's not the same now i remember<br>an example of this is i remember one<br>call when i was calling a man<br>for example his name might have been<br>david and i<br>um i i asked to speak to david and the<br>man that answered the phone was jack<br>and jack said to me actually i've got a<br>brother called david<br>and so and he's given me his cell phone<br>and so it was about those kinds of<br>things that made<br>now we have the national close contact<br>solution<br>which is a purpose-built data management<br>system<br>which enables us to access current data<br>promptly so thank you very much for<br>listening to my early experience of<br>being seconded to the ministry of health<br>i felt very honored to be able to serve<br>the country in this way<br>and i would like to leave you just with<br>one point<br>the covert 19 virus has one goal<br>and that's to infect the host that's us<br>and while we have many goals<br>the important one in eliminating this<br>virus is leadership<br>and that's been evidence-based<br>internationally if we continue to work<br>as a team<br>we will be able to continue to lead the<br>world and our management of this most<br>significant<br>global threat thank you<br>uh thank you fiona um that's uh thank<br>you<br>debra that's a great presentation and<br>we're now going to have<br>dr fiona mlek speak of us fiona is a<br>senior research<br>fellow at the health services research<br>centre she's previously worked at the<br>health inequalities research center<br>at otago university and as a researcher<br>at plunkett<br>and a principal researcher at the health<br>promotion agency<br>uh her research interests are in the<br>social determinants of health<br>and health inequity her previous<br>research has explored the impact of<br>poverty and other socioeconomic factors<br>on health<br>using longitudinal data analysis and<br>looking at the effects of alcohol<br>and alcohol policy on public health<br>her current research project is<br>enhancing primary health care services<br>to improve health in aotearoa new<br>zealand<br>today she's going to be speaking to us<br>on consumer experiences of primary<br>health care<br>during level 3 and 4 lockdown and<br>in particular she'll cover off access to<br>primary health care services<br>during lockdown and mental health<br>effects fiona welcome<br>and we look forward to your presentation<br>i'll just share my screen okay thanks<br>for the opportunity to talk about this<br>is some early results from research we<br>did<br>uh during lockdown and just to give you<br>a<br>a bit of background about why we did<br>this we were doing some work<br>on patient experiences and primary<br>health care and the healthcare home<br>model<br>of primary care and we were just about<br>to to launch that really when we<br>had to go into lockdown and we had to<br>put our research on hold because we were<br>planning on talking to patients<br>face-to-face and of course that<br>was not possible anymore so we wondered<br>what we could do instead<br>um and it seemed like there was a great<br>opportunity here<br>to look at how the delivery of primary<br>healthcare had been<br>changed during lockdown so lockdown we<br>mean level three and level four<br>and during that time primary key was<br>actually instructed to use<br>virtual non-contact consultations<br>wherever possible<br>and by that it meant telephone video<br>email<br>and that had to be done before any<br>patient could be seen in person<br>that was the expectation and of course<br>that was done because<br>we didn't want patients to be exposed to<br>infection and also really importantly we<br>didn't want our healthcare<br>workers to be exposed to infection<br>because there was a danger<br>if we had a system overwhelmed and<br>doctors and nurses were sick<br>then the whole system would collapse so<br>there was a real forced change to<br>delivery primary health care from<br>primarily in-person consultations to<br>these telehealth methods these remote<br>methods of care and what we've realized<br>at the time<br>lockdown is that there wouldn't be any<br>current data collection during the<br>lockdown about patient experiences of<br>healthcare so normally the health and<br>quality safety commission<br>has a patient experience survey that<br>collects data from primary care<br>but this just by bad timing was not in<br>the field and it wouldn't be able to be<br>put in the field during the lockdown<br>period<br>they subsequently put in a survey but it<br>was sort of retrospective and only<br>covered level three<br>the other survey that we could have got<br>data from was the health survey new<br>zealand health supervisor that's a<br>face-to-face survey so that also had to<br>be put on hold<br>they subsequently replaced that with a<br>telephone survey but i only had a couple<br>of questions about access to primary<br>care<br>and nothing really about people's<br>experiences<br>so we thought that we would take the<br>opportunity to actually<br>try to capture some of these experiences<br>that people were having from this change<br>and delivery of primary health care<br>during the lockdown period<br>just to give some context about uh<br>primary care services before<br>covered most consultations in primary<br>care would be in person<br>there was some phone triage and some<br>consults by phone happening<br>but this was not widespread um a patient<br>portal is one of the ways that we can<br>deliver tele health<br>so this is an online platform that<br>patients can use to access<br>their notes they can view test results<br>they can<br>ask for prescriptions book appointments<br>unfortunately not all portals offer all<br>of those services<br>and at the end of 2019 two-thirds of<br>practices were offering a portal but<br>only around 20 of these patients at<br>their practices were registered to the<br>portal<br>are very few using video conferencing<br>and the other<br>options of how you access your results<br>and things were<br>a variable level of access to patients<br>so what did we do we thought we were<br>thinking about how we'll actually get<br>hold of patients so we thought an online<br>survey is probably the most feasible<br>given the<br>stay at home lockdown situation<br>we were wanting to get adults who needed<br>to use primary care during the lockdown<br>um we tried like a new way of<br>recruitment we used a snowball<br>recruitment through social media and<br>networks our professional and personal<br>networks<br>so this led to some limitations which<br>i'll come to uh soon<br>we were aiming for around a thousand<br>responses and we got that<br>and the second part was actually using<br>the survey to recruit some people for<br>in-depth interviews so we could delve<br>into a bit more detail about people's<br>experiences<br>we were actually quite uh almost<br>overwhelmed really with the number of<br>people who volunteered<br>to be interviewed so over 400 people put<br>their names down for us<br>to interview of course we couldn't<br>interview 400 people<br>so we ended up doing 38 in-depth<br>interviews<br>so the results that i have later on come<br>from both the survey and those interview<br>responses<br>just to give you a picture of the<br>timeline so level three and four<br>is the period of our interest we had the<br>online survey<br>in the field during that second level<br>three and<br>part of level four and we had in-depth<br>interviews that started<br>a bit later so some of them ended up<br>being retrospectively asking people<br>about their lockdown experience but most<br>of them were actually done<br>this is just to give an indication of<br>our sample<br>and to note that the sample is not<br>representative<br>of the general population of people who<br>attend primary care<br>so we had more women than than men and<br>actually more women than men do attend<br>primary care but this is<br>a bit more than usual the age range was<br>fairly<br>a fairly good spread but we didn't get<br>the pacific particularly and<br>we had an under representation of maori<br>and we realized that that would be<br>difficult to recruit pacific<br>through the online methodology and so<br>that's the weakness of the of the study<br>we also had it says again from our<br>snowballing<br>uh recruitment a highest response from<br>people who lived in the capital and<br>coast<br>and southern dhb regions and that's<br>because a lot of our networks are based<br>in wellington<br>and also the university of otago did a<br>lot of help with our recruitment so<br>that was where a lot of our respondents<br>so there's some results here i mean the<br>key message which is probably not<br>surprising<br>but most italian health and most contact<br>with primary care during the lockdown<br>period was by phone<br>um very few video consults 95<br>said that they had a video concept<br>interestingly though<br>30 said that they'd make contact with<br>their practice through a portal or<br>website<br>so that suggested to us that was more<br>than we would have expected from the<br>pre-covert<br>telehealth portal sort of statistics so<br>it suggests that more people were<br>registering with the portal<br>and more practices were promoting this<br>and even though<br>practices were told they had to have<br>telehealth as the first<br>point of contact with with patients<br>nearly over a quarter of people actually<br>went and visited their<br>their primary care practitioner so<br>people were actually being seen<br>the key message that we have in terms of<br>how people experienced telehealth was<br>that the satisfaction was<br>high 86 satisfied or very satisfied with<br>telephone<br>90 with the video consults that's as<br>least as good as what you'd expect from<br>pre-covered<br>levels of satisfaction one thing we did<br>though is ask some<br>people a bit more detail about the<br>quality of the experience so one of the<br>questions we asked was<br>did you feel like the doctor or nurse<br>spent enough time with you<br>and overall again over 90 people thought<br>that yes<br>with the telephone or the video the<br>doctor spent enough time but there was a<br>proportion 20<br>of people with the telephone consults<br>thought it wasn't<br>it wasn't quite as good as in person so<br>even though the telehealth was working<br>really well for most people<br>some people still thought it would have<br>what do people like about telehealth<br>it's not really surprising but<br>one of the key things and this has been<br>found in previous research done before<br>the lockdown period or before pandemics<br>it's really convenient to save people<br>time they don't need to travel<br>um it saves people money and the key<br>thing especially in this context was<br>that<br>people weren't having to sit in waiting<br>rooms being exposed to infection<br>and although that might be a specific<br>covert related<br>aspect people did mention about the fact<br>even in<br>in regular times they don't want to be<br>sitting in a waiting room they don't<br>want to be<br>sneezed and coughed on with even a<br>regular flu so that was a definite plus<br>it was certainly people talked about the<br>types of consult it work well for<br>so regular routine issues uh<br>a pres for prescription um things like<br>issues that they knew well and their<br>doctor did well very very happy with<br>having a telephone consult<br>and you can see from the 25 or 26 of<br>people who went on to have an in-person<br>consult<br>there were some things it didn't work so<br>well for but people valued<br>being able to talk to their doctor be<br>reassured having their issues sorted out<br>and being listened to<br>and most people found it quite unhurried<br>and timely and actually a lot of people<br>mentioned<br>how they found it easier to get hold of<br>their doctor during this time<br>the doctors often weren't so busy and so<br>they could be seen quicker<br>and it felt like they were taking more<br>time<br>i have to say even though i've got what<br>people don't like about telehealth there<br>were many more positive<br>actually uh responses than negative but<br>the thing the main thing that people<br>talked about that<br>tully health didn't work so well for is<br>when they needed to be examined which is<br>not surprising so<br>if they had an issue where they felt<br>that and they needed examination<br>that means they were less confident and<br>the diagnosis they were less reassured<br>um another issue that came out but maybe<br>not as much as you might expect but<br>still came out<br>was the cost of the consult so a lot of<br>the consults really have consults were<br>charged at the same price as an<br>in-person consult some were<br>priced maybe half as much and people<br>were quite sensitive to that so if they<br>had a console by telephone<br>which felt as in-depth and the sort of<br>length as they would have in person<br>people were quite happy to pay for that<br>but if they had a consult which felt<br>quite short<br>of a couple of minutes even if they got<br>their issues sorted out they sort of<br>felt like that wasn't so much value for<br>money and they weren't so happy to pay a<br>full price<br>people did mention uh some technological<br>difficulties but they were also quite<br>good at working around them<br>so a lot of people took photos or rashes<br>or other things and sent it to their<br>practice<br>if the video didn't work like that<br>changed to telephone so there were some<br>technological difficulties but people<br>were pretty accommodating and trying to<br>work with these around<br>and there were a few people who thought<br>that the telephone particularly<br>felt rushed or less personal but some<br>context around that<br>some people found that even just the<br>general demeanor of<br>the practice and this really early kind<br>of um disruptive time<br>some practices felt kind of panicky and<br>they weren't<br>um as maybe as organized as others and<br>for the practices where the<br>practitioners were very calm and<br>reassuring this sort of<br>just some general data we asked a few<br>questions just around<br>the pandemic and house so this is around<br>the level of concern people had around<br>the impact of the pandemic on their<br>health<br>and it actually overall was pretty high<br>so almost half of people overall<br>were either extremely very moderately<br>concerned about the impact of the<br>pandemic of the house<br>a little bit higher and older people as<br>you might expect<br>and then another question as we asked is<br>has the pandemic made it easier or more<br>difficult to manage your health<br>interestingly for this one was the<br>younger people who reported that they<br>thought it would be more difficult to<br>manage their health and then people with<br>long-term health conditions<br>or disabilities people who were<br>unemployed or struggling with living<br>costs also thought that would be more<br>difficult to manage their health<br>and just finally i wanted to make some<br>comments about um<br>mental health care and impacts and<br>well-being that we got from the data we<br>didn't design the survey in terms of<br>asking about<br>mental health but it's something that<br>people talked about spontaneously<br>and there was a lot of data around this<br>so these are preliminary findings i'm<br>just going to show you a few quotes to<br>demonstrate some things that we thought<br>came out quite strongly the first is<br>around how people<br>vary there were variable experiences<br>about how people<br>found mental health services and the<br>impact of lockdown mental health and<br>wellbeing was also quite variable<br>so this was just a few quotes from<br>different people around<br>how they found accessing mental health<br>services so for people who had an<br>existing<br>mental health condition the first quote<br>there is as<br>when it didn't work very well so this<br>lady couldn't get hold of her<br>psychologist<br>and her mental health declined but the<br>next person actually found the opposite<br>she<br>continued to connect with her therapist<br>through video and that worked well for<br>her<br>even though she was looking forward to<br>getting back to normal<br>other people even though the secondary<br>services might not have<br>worked well for them they managed to get<br>mental health support through primary<br>care<br>and then there was a another sense that<br>some people didn't actually know what<br>they'd do if they needed help they<br>weren't sure where that they would go<br>for mental health support<br>and so maybe there was a group missing<br>missing out there<br>but for people who did manage to access<br>like their helpline<br>that debra mentioned again kind of<br>variable experiences so the first person<br>found it difficult to get hold of<br>someone to talk to and that<br>increased their distress but then<br>another person had a good experience of<br>the mental health line so this is<br>somebody<br>who didn't have a previous mental health<br>um<br>illness but she was feeling distressed<br>by the lockdown experience and she found<br>that the helpline<br>really was really good at supporting her<br>in general the impact a lot down on<br>wellbeing was quite<br>mixed but a lot of people found it quite<br>positive we had someone who said covert<br>was a gift<br>to us it helped us connect it helped us<br>slow down<br>but there were also things that could<br>not be couldn't work so well for them so<br>that's quite this first quake is an<br>example a lot of people said that they<br>drank a bit more than usual<br>and this might not be the best way of<br>coping so even though the time pressure<br>was less<br>um they felt like the pace of life had<br>slowed down<br>some people a lot of people said that<br>they could do more exercise but there<br>were still stresses so for this lady<br>the stresses around finances<br>relationship with her husband wasn't so<br>good<br>and so there was a bit of a mixed bag<br>the issue around connections and social<br>connections and relationships again<br>quite mixed so the second person here<br>was really valuing the quality time that<br>they got to spend with their<br>relatives um people who were living<br>alone but isolated<br>that was the thing they struggled with<br>even if they had more time to go for<br>walks<br>and have a better diet so again a mixed<br>bag<br>some things positive some things<br>negative<br>so just concluding things that we we've<br>found<br>so far is that this sort of unexpected<br>crisis disruption<br>really really sudden change and delivery<br>of primary health care<br>could actually be a positive thing<br>patients<br>were very satisfied with the services<br>overall that they received<br>um and found out the positive experience<br>in a lot of cases<br>and telehealth specifically was able to<br>deliver care that was at least as good<br>as in person care for a lot of people in<br>a lot of circumstances but it was quite<br>clear that it wouldn't work for<br>everybody<br>in all circumstances in terms of mental<br>distress the lockdown accepted it for<br>some people and services didn't always<br>respond<br>or wasn't always available and in<br>general<br>experiences in lockdown actually provide<br>an opportunity for<br>positive behavior changes i'm not sure<br>how embedded these changes will be or<br>whether people will continue some of<br>these positive changes<br>but it was certainly an opportunity but<br>then there were also some<br>negative things that creep in there<br>and my final slide is just acknowledging<br>my team<br>um great thanks to the survey interview<br>participants<br>that gave us all this really rich data<br>and this was<br>a hsc funded project which we uh<br>we transformed into this into this<br>research<br>uh thank you fiona that's terrific<br>and we greatly enjoy your presentation<br>um and now we'll go to the questions so<br>let's take them in order<br>according to the voting so dear review<br>differently<br>things that that we found difficult uh<br>was something that fiona uh talked about<br>was the lack of capacity so<br>uh for example referring people to<br>line and health and and then taking<br>sometimes up to two hours for somebody<br>to answer<br>the the health line call so having<br>more support in those very early days<br>for members of the public i think that<br>would have been<br>brilliant excuse me the other thing<br>that we won't ever have to go through<br>again<br>is having a robust data collection<br>system<br>which we didn't have we designed our<br>data collections sheets on<br>using excel um you know for those<br>initial<br>times and the risk of um making an error<br>or um you know was high um<br>and although we we were aware of that<br>and we worked very hard with that<br>um so if if we could start again<br>it would be to have a good data<br>management system<br>uh thank you for that um so the next<br>question is for you too deborah there's<br>a three-call<br>model still employed by the ministry of<br>health and are you aware of any updates<br>that have occurred in the contact<br>tracing protocol since the early set up<br>so uh thank you for the question it's a<br>great question and yes the three-core<br>model is still<br>used however there is additional calls<br>now<br>welfare check calls which which are<br>largely<br>done by health healthline um because we<br>we found that we needed to contact<br>people<br>during the time that they were<br>self-isolating<br>or quarantined being in quarantine<br>as would be the correct terminology<br>quarantined for quite well<br>self-isolation<br>technically is for somebody who is ill<br>um<br>so there is an extra call in there but<br>it's not called call for it's called<br>wellness checks i think it's a model<br>that works very well<br>in terms of have there been updates in<br>national<br>contact tracing yes i'm sure that there<br>have been<br>i haven't been actually in the ministry<br>of health myself for the last couple of<br>months<br>i've been back at the university but<br>it's a constantly<br>evolving process with people reviewing<br>what's working and what's not working<br>all the time<br>so i'm i can't update you personally but<br>i feel sure that people are working on<br>making sure it's<br>current uh thank you<br>and uh now here's one for you fiona is<br>there a potential<br>to have a practice that is not local to<br>the customer<br>um respond uh in uh<br>telehealth um this would have a<br>desirable impact of introducing<br>competition so<br>i think the question might be going so<br>what say somebody from whangarei wanted<br>to answer a question in invercargill or<br>i mean telehealth was almost designed<br>for this kind of thing<br>really um for example in australia<br>telehealth used to connect rural<br>communities with specialists<br>and other but actually in new zealand<br>there's been initiatives in northland<br>for example where you can get<br>specialists<br>to review a patient so they don't<br>actually have to be<br>i don't travel go there so exactly<br>charlie health is<br>definitely got the potential i don't i<br>know i'm not sure about introducing<br>competition i think it's actually<br>improving services so that people who<br>are particularly in remote areas will be<br>act better access specialists and other<br>people<br>to support their their health needs<br>without the burden of having to travel a<br>lot<br>and spend costs on that um the other<br>thing in terms of<br>covert specifically people did have some<br>concerns about the fact that they were<br>told to stay at home<br>but their primary care might be located<br>where they work which they could travel<br>some distance to<br>so there was some confusions about<br>whether it was allowed to travel<br>uh out of out of your neighborhood to<br>your primary care<br>but telehealth can actually get around<br>some of that because you can connect<br>with your usual provider<br>through video or telephone and then get<br>the advice about what to do so it's<br>it's certainly uh has great great<br>potential to<br>reduce inequalities and improve access<br>for people who might not otherwise<br>be able to travel okay so<br>so the truth of the matter is we already<br>have<br>telehealth after hours so if somebody<br>wants help after hours they call<br>healthline<br>and i can assure you that's not going to<br>be<br>based and fielding um and so<br>you know people are getting already<br>getting health advice<br>what do you think about the notion of<br>the<br>the provider of the health loan service<br>not having access to the patient's<br>so not having access or i mean it would<br>be advantageous if all of our health<br>services were linked up so<br>we must also make sure that we've got<br>privacy and security set up but<br>we haven't quite cracked the whole<br>medical link record yet<br>so ideally we could improve our services<br>if we could integrate<br>secondary and primary care that we could<br>have a picture<br>of the patient so we know what medical<br>medications they've taken what their<br>conditions are<br>so this goes beyond healthy health it's<br>more like a<br>digital i guess bringing together of all<br>of our health services to actually<br>enable us to deliver better care so<br>debri you must have had some experience<br>in this space<br>it's often a thing that's raised can<br>health lines<br>and their generically speaking provide<br>the best service<br>um i think healthline do provide<br>a service to the public that's<br>outstanding<br>um and i'm really pleased that we've got<br>that service<br>in in new zealand um if they are out of<br>their depth and they can't provide<br>this um advice then they know where to<br>refer to<br>and so it does mean that i mean my<br>experience<br>with it largely is with mothers and<br>fathers of brand new babies<br>and you know that's often a time in<br>somebody's life<br>where they need an awful lot of support<br>and advice and they might just be<br>slightly worried about something<br>um and they're not sure whether they<br>need to um access<br>you know increased services or<br>take the baby into ed and particularly<br>when they might not want to do that<br>because<br>um in the covered kind of time so that<br>it does<br>actually provide a fantastic service for<br>what it's meant to do<br>thank you very much now we'll go back to<br>fiona there's a question here<br>fiona do you know if there has been an<br>increase in the use of telehealth and<br>post lockdown times<br>well it actually has has kind of bounced<br>back to normal so a lot of people have<br>just<br>reverted back to the usual in-person<br>care so<br>i as the most recent data i've seen is<br>that<br>there has been an increase in telehealth<br>computer before coping but certainly<br>nothing like the levels that we had<br>during lockdown<br>um in some ways it's a bit disappointing<br>because<br>a lot of people had a really good<br>experience with telehealth during<br>lockdown and<br>and it was definitely got great feedback<br>from people about how they wanted it to<br>continue<br>they wanted to still be able to access<br>their primary care<br>through tully health but it's not clear<br>whether<br>this isn't happening so much because<br>patients have stopped asking<br>for it or because practices have just<br>reverted back to what they know<br>and maybe the systems are not there to<br>support them particularly financially<br>it's been quite difficult for practices<br>i think to figure out how they can<br>charge appropriately vitaly health and<br>that's something that really needs to be<br>sorted out<br>thank you now here's another one for you<br>fiona in<br>medical terms and i hope that's a very<br>broad term including both<br>medical practitioners and nurse nursing<br>staff<br>in medical terms what was the quality of<br>the medical consult have we learned<br>something that can be applied to<br>business as usual<br>and how much more cost effective it says<br>a percent is this reaction is this<br>interaction<br>so it's a question around the quality<br>and the<br>cost effectiveness of the interaction i<br>can't answer the cost of<br>thickness question because we didn't<br>look at that but i did show you one<br>slide around<br>the quality measure and we only we asked<br>quality in terms this is the patient<br>experience so we asked the patient to<br>rate the quality on four measures and i<br>showed you one thing but i'll just show<br>you<br>um the four questions that we asked i'll<br>share the screen<br>so you can see that we asked<br>four questions one the one i showed you<br>is around spending time we also asked<br>people<br>did the doctor or nurse explain things<br>um to you in a way that you could<br>understand do they treat you with<br>kindness<br>and did they did they listen to you so<br>for all of these things overall tully<br>health rated<br>highly again more than 90 but you can<br>see there was a small percentage of<br>people on the other questions there<br>that thought it would be better in<br>person so that's the little red<br>percentage<br>i think in terms of quality in terms of<br>what we could apply to business as usual<br>we know that telehealth doesn't work for<br>all situations and for all people and i<br>think this is a<br>demonstrating that obviously normally<br>you would<br>offer telehealth as an option whereas in<br>this case in lockdown<br>everybody had to do it so there's some<br>situations where telehealth doesn't work<br>it's not appropriate if somebody has to<br>be seen have to be examined<br>and i think that's what we're picking up<br>here there's some things where it<br>doesn't work but if we go back to<br>business as usual and you give patients<br>the choice<br>about um the type of service that they<br>want<br>i think that that level of satisfaction<br>on these quality indicators will be high<br>thank you now i've got a question for<br>deborah debra<br>how ready do you think we are to cope if<br>there is<br>a sudden influx of community<br>transmission<br>um thank you thank you gregor um i think<br>we are ready<br>i really don't want that to happen<br>nobody does and<br>um i think having our borders closed<br>and if only those people would stay in<br>their<br>in the border quarantine places and not<br>not um<br>come out that would be super but i think<br>we are prepared and ready to go in fact<br>i'm confident<br>that if we do have an outbreak<br>that the service that is created will<br>respond appropriately<br>and continue to protect us i know that<br>and i have heard in the media<br>quite a lot of concern about the lack of<br>use<br>of the app and the new zealand public<br>not completely engaging in that and i've<br>thought about that quite a bit<br>but my reflection on it is this<br>um actually we didn't even have the app<br>to begin with<br>and we did that contact racing and we<br>were able to get to<br>elimination and not only that we've kept<br>it there<br>for over 90 days now and so<br>i think as long as we continue to work<br>as a team together all of us in new<br>zealand<br>i feel assured that we will be able to<br>do effective contact tracing again if we<br>have to<br>okay thanks debra now look i've got a<br>tricky question for you<br>how long do you think new zealand's<br>how long is a piece of string<br>i'm not sure about that i i do remember<br>the weekend before the borders are<br>closed i was working in the ministry of<br>health at the time<br>and i was walking around eastbourne and<br>i and i knew what was happening and was<br>very cognizant of the data and thinking<br>about it<br>and i turned to my husband and i said if<br>i was jacinda ardern i'd close the<br>borders it's going to be the only way to<br>control it<br>and it happened a few days later i think<br>opening the borders is going to pose a<br>risk for us<br>um and so i'm not sure quite when we're<br>going to do that<br>thank you well uh my next question uh<br>since<br>um there aren't any sitting at the<br>moment is actually<br>for fiona fiona what do you think<br>was or is the accumulated health care<br>deficit<br>that that happened during the time of<br>shutdown<br>so the question is do you think there is<br>a whole lot of unmet health need<br>that has accumulated that hasn't been<br>oh i can show you something oh sorry<br>yes i mean there definitely will be i'll<br>so we did ask people about whether<br>they'd delayed seeking health care<br>half of people about half of people said<br>that they had<br>and you can see on this slide here the<br>reasons that people go for delaying<br>seeking health care<br>and the the big one actually was<br>concerned that people were the health<br>care workers were too busy<br>and that's their problem wasn't urgent<br>enough and so resources resources were<br>needed for more urgent problems so<br>people were really triaging themselves<br>they were saying i don't think this is a<br>serious concern i don't want to bother<br>anybody<br>also there was some the next group 20<br>of people said that the service that<br>they had already booked or planned or<br>was supposed to happen that was delayed<br>or postponed<br>so that will have consequences for<br>people and then people were not seeking<br>health care because they they were<br>afraid of being affected there was a lot<br>of fear out there<br>or they just couldn't get hold of the<br>health care so i think from<br>these responses the people that delay<br>seeking healthcare<br>there will be consequences for that but<br>from what i've heard<br>um services are catching up um and there<br>hasn't<br>had primary care hasn't been overwhelmed<br>with people<br>coming in and we certainly had stories<br>from our participants that<br>they triaged themselves they thought<br>they had a concern that they would<br>normally see their doctor for but they<br>just decided to manage it themselves and<br>they managed crying<br>so there was definitely some people who<br>didn't go and seek care<br>and it all worked out fine but i'm sure<br>that there will be people who<br>decided not to go but there will be<br>subsequent consequences for that<br>thank you and now that was a really<br>interesting study that you conducted<br>and i'm interested to know did you look<br>at the other side of the equation if you<br>like<br>so you did a survey of patients did you<br>talk to the<br>practice staff nurses doctors to get<br>their view of the success of telehealth<br>in copenhagen<br>no and the reason we didn't do that is<br>that we knew that other people were<br>doing that<br>and so we were afraid that the patient<br>voice was going to be lost because<br>there was no ongoing at the time data<br>collection around patient experiences<br>so we have already getting some results<br>looking at the practice perspective but<br>we<br>really just wanted to focus on the<br>patients but will be interesting to sort<br>of marry those results up<br>and look at why there are differences so<br>one difference that has come<br>out is that from our survey our patients<br>were quite<br>astute in terms of knowing what things<br>needed to be seen in person and what<br>things that could be done by<br>the health the feedback i've seen from<br>practices is that they don't think that<br>patients are very good at that so it<br>would be really interesting to<br>understand that a bit more<br>about why there's that difference<br>right thank you very much um we're going<br>to close the seminar<br>now so thank you for joining the first<br>of this spotlight series on cover 19 in<br>public health<br>tomorrow we've got our second in the<br>series at the same time<br>12 midday we'll have prof colin simpson<br>talking
