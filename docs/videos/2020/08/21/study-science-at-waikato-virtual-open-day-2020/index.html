science at the university<br>of waikato<br>so before we get on today underway what<br>is<br>science right so when many people think<br>about science they have ideas of men and<br>women in white lab coats uh sort of<br>scurrying away in a laboratory trying to<br>understand something that maybe isn't of<br>relevance<br>to many people in the world but i want<br>to try and convince you that science is<br>actually so much more than that<br>because scientists here at the<br>university of waikato when we think<br>science<br>we think getting bush right we get think<br>of getting out into beautiful aotearoa<br>and understanding our flora and fauna we<br>think also<br>of going into extreme environments so<br>here is research that we undertake<br>down in antarctica trying to understand<br>the dry valleys and their<br>changes with climate we also think of<br>getting deep<br>underground so looking at our caving<br>networks our stalactites and static<br>mites<br>trying to understand something about<br>drip waters and how we can sort of infer<br>something about<br>past climate we also think about getting<br>out on the ocean<br>and here we've got uh associate<br>professor kura paul burke<br>out at our turdon campus uh enjoying the<br>beautiful tauranga moana<br>trying to understand something about<br>marine biology and the ecology of that<br>network<br>and for those not content with staying<br>above the surface we can get in and get<br>deep<br>underwater trying to understand what is<br>happening with things like the white<br>islands uh disaster<br>and understanding how that eruption has<br>impacted the local marine<br>ecosystem so when we think science we<br>think something<br>so much brought more broadly than just<br>what you might understand from a lab<br>coat<br>and somebody working in a laboratory the<br>definition of science if you look it up<br>in a dictionary will be something along<br>these lines<br>so it's a systematic study of the<br>structure and behavior of the physical<br>and natural world that we look at<br>through observation<br>that's the definition you might find in<br>the dictionary it's not the definition<br>i'd use<br>the definition that i would work with is<br>that science is simply structured<br>curiosity<br>right if you are passionate and<br>interested about the world around us<br>if you wonder why things happen then<br>science a career in science<br>could be for you so if you were to have<br>a look<br>in a new zealand context and try to<br>understand where science fits<br>into our broader economy you might find<br>something like this national statement<br>about science investment<br>and there's some great text in there<br>right science plays a central role in<br>creating opportunities and solving<br>problems<br>associated with our well-being and our<br>economy okay<br>we know though that we're seeing<br>increasing funding of<br>uh government uh interest into the<br>science sector<br>and at this present time you know where<br>we are sort of struggling and battling a<br>little bit with<br>the effects of covert 19 i think this<br>has been an opportunity to really<br>showcase the importance of science<br>uh in the new zealand society there was<br>a great article that was published in<br>the new zealand herald not so long ago<br>that sort of outlined some of the key<br>scientists who have led our<br>fight against covert and have really<br>been what has set our nation and our<br>government apart<br>compared to other nations of the world<br>we've simply listened to the scientific<br>experts<br>we've had great leaders in place uh and<br>as a consequence we have had<br>you know a relatively mild uh symptoms<br>and cases associated with covert 19.<br>what i'd also say and i'd normally talk<br>about this<br>at the beginning of any presentation is<br>to talk about what a career in science<br>might look like so this is this is very<br>live and fresh data i put this together<br>just<br>last night so quickly jumped on seek.nz<br>to have a little bit of a look of the<br>sorts of jobs<br>that are in place uh here in aotearoa<br>new zealand and also<br>uh over across in australia so currently<br>we see about 800 jobs in the new zealand<br>context and about 5 000 uh in australia<br>and here's a selection of some of the<br>things you might see right so chemistry<br>technician this is probably the sort of<br>thing you were expecting<br>when you were thinking about a career in<br>science so that's pretty pretty normal<br>we see things though roles that might be<br>a little bit more different than what<br>you're expecting<br>things like policy analysts so writing<br>and shaping and crafting the policies<br>that define science and how this works<br>uh in the new zealand system<br>we see roles in terms of building and<br>construction ensuring we've got<br>environmental managers that<br>ensure the impact of any construction<br>process is not going to be too<br>detrimental<br>to the broader environment we see roles<br>associated with agriculture this one<br>looking for sustainable dairying<br>how do we partner a rising and growing<br>sort of agricultural sector in new<br>zealand how do we balance that against<br>the needs of the environment<br>we see roles associated with biosafety<br>and of course this is really prevalent<br>and really significant<br>both in terms of bringing in invasive<br>species but also in terms of<br>bringing in and importing things like<br>the covet 19 virus<br>we also see roles associated with good<br>use of water resources<br>so this one advertised over in the<br>hawke's bay region<br>a region that produces a large amount of<br>fruit and other sort of agricultural<br>sort of products but one that's grouped<br>with<br>drought conditions many years so being<br>able to use that water in an effective<br>way<br>is really important and then lastly as<br>an example to look at<br>this is a role working at scion one of<br>our crown research institutes<br>uh looking about the sustainable value<br>chain scientist in the maori sector<br>and this is something we see<br>increasingly uh in the new zealand<br>context<br>where eewee groups have significant<br>interest in a number of environmental<br>areas and environmental issues and are<br>needing to be able to bridge that gap<br>between a western world<br>and understanding of science and a tea<br>maori a mataranga maori<br>world view of how that science uh<br>interplays with modern culture<br>so those are just some of the jobs that<br>you can find advertised at the moment<br>and i guess what i'd like to highlight<br>is that even under the present<br>situation with covert 19 we're parts of<br>our economy<br>under a significant pressure we still<br>see strong demand for science graduates<br>which makes it an exciting career for<br>you to consider<br>so hopefully i've managed to convince<br>you of why you might want to study<br>science<br>why science might be an exciting career<br>for you let me try and outline a little<br>bit why<br>i think it's the best choice to come to<br>the university of waikoto<br>to be able to study your science degree<br>i'm going to run through four points<br>our facilities our learning style our<br>career focused<br>and flexible qualifications and also<br>lastly the personalized experience that<br>you get<br>as a student at the university of wakato<br>so firstly our world-class facilities so<br>the university of waikato where whether<br>you are at our hamilton<br>campus or whether you are across our<br>tauranga campus<br>which is beautiful and i must say if you<br>get a chance to go check out this new<br>building<br>it really is something special but we<br>have world-class facilities at both<br>campuses<br>be that in a laboratory kind of setting<br>the traditional understanding of what<br>you might think of as science<br>or be that you know trying to look into<br>the agricultural sector<br>in the back here you can see some images<br>of manuka flowers<br>these manuka plants are being grown to<br>try and understand<br>the different conditions that affect the<br>production of manuka honey<br>maybe you've seen manuka honey at<br>supermarkets and you've seen<br>the sort of understanding of the medical<br>benefits or the<br>sort of positive health benefits<br>associated with manuka honey<br>what you might not know is that that<br>research was really undertaken<br>uh at the university of waikato it was<br>researchers here that sort of opened our<br>understanding<br>of what the manuka honey industry really<br>could be<br>uh lastly uh in terms of getting out and<br>into our beautiful arteroa so this is an<br>experiment where they're trying to<br>understand something around soil<br>respiration<br>so this is in the area of our<br>agricultural greenhouse gas emissions<br>the different impacts that we have on<br>the soils and how we can understand<br>those processes<br>to ensure a good partnership between<br>farming and agriculture<br>and also our commitments to reducing<br>greenhouse gases<br>okay hands-on learning so this is<br>something i'd like to kind of pause and<br>talk a little bit about<br>obviously under the current covert 19<br>situations<br>some decisions have had to be made to<br>move some learning<br>into an online format what i want to<br>encourage and kind of<br>let you guys know is that you know the<br>university of waikuto our science<br>program is still very much a hands-on<br>program<br>while we've moved some of our lecture<br>delivery to an online format<br>our labs and our pr and our practical<br>elements our field trips etc are still<br>underway and students are having a<br>fantastic time so be that<br>if you're getting out into a kind of a<br>coastal environment and we run a number<br>of different field trips uh scattered<br>throughout our different programs<br>particularly in environmental sciences<br>ecology biodiversity<br>and in earth sciences be that hands-on<br>work in a laboratory<br>so you'll get access to some of the<br>great uh sort of world-class facilities<br>uh even in your undergraduate laboratory<br>so your first time at university you'll<br>be working with fantastic equipment<br>in this case we're looking at some<br>microscopes in a biology setting<br>but they might be in a chemistry setting<br>or other sort of lab<br>experiences as well um lastly<br>to talk about one of our very famous<br>field trips which is that looking at the<br>tongariro crossing<br>so this is a key component of our earth<br>sciences program and a highlight of some<br>students and their time at the<br>university of wakato<br>career focused and flexible<br>qualifications so i had the privilege<br>a few years ago of leading the design<br>and redevelopment of our undergraduate<br>and postgraduate curriculums<br>at the university of waikato with a<br>strong focus of trying to create<br>degree programs that really helped to<br>match a student's ambitions and goals<br>with their career<br>with their current state of learning so<br>whether you're a school leaver or a<br>mature student looking and considering<br>to study at the university of waikato<br>in terms of science we run a broad a<br>number of different science subjects<br>so aquaculture chemistry earth sciences<br>ecology and biodiversity<br>environmental sciences material science<br>molecular and cellular biology<br>and psychology aquaculture and<br>environmental sciences are available at<br>our total campus<br>uh with aquaculture being specifically<br>just at the tauranga campus<br>we then have a broader range of minor<br>subjects things like animal behavior and<br>biochemistry hydrology<br>geology and soil science are some of the<br>specific minors that are available<br>uh here at the university of wakato now<br>what we encourage you to do is to choose<br>a combination of your major subjects and<br>minor subjects<br>to really create a a degree that fits<br>for you<br>right it matches where you're trying to<br>get to with your career<br>and your study options we also believe<br>really strongly in trying to give<br>students their very best<br>opportunities going out into the<br>workplace and so we can kick off<br>your career right to finish up your<br>degree here at the university of waikato<br>by completing one of three different<br>so-called career star papers<br>now these papers are unique to the<br>university of waikato<br>and there are three papers that are<br>really for different types of students<br>who<br>have different career ambitions one's<br>not better or worse than another<br>it's really just about trying to connect<br>you from your learning now<br>to where you're trying to go with your<br>career so the first of these are our<br>capstone projects<br>these are projects for students that are<br>looking to develop their teamwork<br>communication skills their ability to<br>work in groups to effectively solve<br>our genuine real world problems we've<br>had some exciting capstone projects<br>over the last couple of years looking at<br>things like the remediation of the<br>makatoo estuary<br>over in the tauranga region which has<br>recently had fresh water diverted into<br>it for the first time in many decades<br>our students have had an opportunity to<br>work with local erie and to understand<br>the baseline what was the environment<br>like before this change<br>and then how has it changed since the<br>reintroduction of water<br>it's a pretty exciting project and in<br>totally different types of projects we<br>have students outplaced into local<br>primary schools<br>who get the opportunity to work and<br>really share their love and knowledge of<br>science<br>with those primary school students our<br>scientists in schools program is really<br>popular with a number of<br>different graduates from a range of<br>different fields<br>so those are some of our capstone<br>projects<br>we also then have our undergraduate<br>research projects<br>so if you're a student and you're<br>thinking maybe about doing masters<br>research or going on to do a phd<br>we'll give you the opportunity to do<br>real research as a part of your<br>undergraduate program<br>that's a great chance to try out uh what<br>it's like to be a postgraduate student<br>and it will set you up perfectly to be<br>able to go on and continue<br>uh with further study lastly we have our<br>science work placements<br>if you're a student that's looking to<br>get a job out into industry<br>maybe you like the sound of that<br>chemistry technician role that we<br>talked about a little bit earlier you<br>know this is a great opportunity to get<br>a 10 week<br>normally paid internship uh working at a<br>local business<br>this solves the catch-22 that often uh<br>students<br>find when they try to get their first<br>job they keep looking at jobs that are<br>advertised and they say hey<br>we'd really like somebody with work<br>experience but of course how do you get<br>work experience if you haven't yet got a<br>job<br>so we have a fantastic work integrated<br>learning uh office who will partner you<br>with<br>a local business a local industry to be<br>able to get that<br>step up into the career workforce that<br>you are looking for<br>okay so lastly a personalized ex<br>approach<br>or personalized experience so i can talk<br>about this um<br>personally or individually so as a<br>student myself<br>a few years ago now i had the<br>experiences and privilege i guess of<br>studying at the university of otago<br>but i was one of 1500 students in the<br>first year health science class<br>and i was but a number here at the<br>university of waikato we have much<br>smaller classes<br>which gives you better access to your<br>academics to your professors to your<br>tutors<br>to those who are going to support your<br>learning okay<br>um and you know we ran a range of<br>different programs to help support what<br>you're doing in and outside of the<br>classroom<br>so we'll give you individualized degree<br>planning we will help to connect your<br>ambitions your goals for your career<br>with where you currently are based we<br>have dedicated support staff for<br>students<br>a range of different one-on-one sort of<br>study options and other traditional<br>support<br>and we have as i mentioned before the<br>fantastic work integrated learning<br>office which helps to partner you with a<br>local<br>business to get you that all important<br>work experience<br>um finally the last thing i'd like to<br>say in terms of this personalized<br>experience<br>is just to reflect a little bit on what<br>it was like to do online learning<br>uh during the first half of this year so<br>here are a selection of quotes<br>uh of that came through from our<br>appraisal process uh talking about one<br>of the courses that we teach in<br>at the university of waikato and what we<br>found is that<br>you know overall students were really<br>really very pleased with the support<br>and the organization and how things were<br>went<br>as we transitioned to an online<br>environment it's obviously not the<br>perfect scenario to need to<br>want to study under conditions of level<br>3 and level 4 restrictions<br>but we did a pretty good job of that i<br>have to admit the bottom quote down the<br>top bottom left-hand corner that's one<br>about a course that i teach in<br>and it's pretty bold statement to say<br>that uh enthusiasm and passion and<br>interest for our science subjects<br>might be more uh contagious than coven<br>so anyway that's it that's all i've got<br>um for you today<br>uh happy to take any questions um and<br>great to have you joining us</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
