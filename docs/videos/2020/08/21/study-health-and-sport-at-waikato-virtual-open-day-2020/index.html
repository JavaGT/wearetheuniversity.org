and high performance<br>sport and broader areas of human<br>performance<br>and biomedical sciences we're a unique<br>school at the university and that we<br>cover a whole range of disciplines so we<br>have<br>academic staff and students who are<br>sociologists<br>sports scientists physiologists pedagogy<br>pedagogues that's people who are<br>interested in teaching and learning<br>biomedical scientists and experts in<br>maori and community health<br>and we all work together to try and<br>progress things in relation to<br>community health just to give you a bit<br>more of a background on us<br>some couple of things we recognize and<br>kind of pride ourselves on<br>so i know this is supposed to be a talk<br>about uh<br>you coming to study here but just to get<br>a sense of who we are i thought i'd<br>start with this<br>so we recognise that all matters do with<br>health health and well-being<br>are really complex and there's no simple<br>answer to any of the pressing issues<br>that we see<br>in the broad areas of health sport human<br>performance<br>you know so if we're talking about<br>poverty healthy homes environmental<br>hazards youth suicide reproductive<br>health talent development and sport<br>genetics diabetics any of those sort of<br>things<br>we recognise that all of them are shaped<br>by<br>economics by culture by history by<br>politics<br>and those of you who have studied in uh<br>senior physical education or in health<br>subjects or<br>in um biological sciences will<br>understand that<br>there's no simple solution to these<br>things and it's going to take<br>a complex understanding to make sense<br>then<br>so we believe only the combined<br>knowledge<br>skills resources assets of a whole range<br>of people<br>and our communities and the<br>organizations we work with can really<br>generate solutions to address these<br>pressing health needs in aotearoa and<br>new zealand<br>so that means we need people who are<br>interested<br>in health in the broader sense to work<br>in this sector<br>because the health sector is massive<br>there's people in councils who work in<br>health there's people on the dhb who<br>work in health there's scientists who<br>work in health<br>there's people who work in community<br>sporting organizations physical activity<br>enabling good lives a whole range of<br>people are needed to make sense of<br>health in our communities<br>so if any of this sounds like you<br>or any of these statements sounds like<br>you then this might be the place to come<br>if you can hear yourself saying i love<br>science particularly in relation to<br>health<br>sport or medicine then maybe this is a<br>program these programs are for you<br>if you're fascinated by how the health<br>system works the inequities who gets<br>access who doesn't<br>rural communities maori health then<br>maybe this is the place for you<br>if you're just really passionate about<br>sport physical activity well-being<br>being active yourself then maybe there's<br>a program for you here<br>as well and if you think about health<br>system<br>and you think it could be a whole lot<br>better because as we're saying with<br>covert<br>some things work and some things don't<br>so if you think you could be<br>a person who could contribute to making<br>that better then<br>maybe there's a program here for you as<br>well so we want<br>to grow people who will be leaders be<br>leaders in health health and wellbeing<br>be leaders in sport active recreation<br>and physical activity<br>and when i use those terms i'm really<br>thinking about all the sorts of jobs and<br>opportunities there are<br>in there so there's people who are<br>involved in policy and planning and<br>public health and we're seeing that<br>every day<br>and if you've watched the 1pm news<br>briefing rank over today you'll be<br>seeing people who<br>are talking about policy talking about<br>planning and talking about public health<br>we'll be seeing the biomedical<br>scientists who are um<br>you know making helping us make<br>decisions about should we wear masks<br>should we not<br>there's also the people who are out on<br>the front line doing community action<br>thinking about how we deliver these<br>programs and<br>centrally important to us is that maori<br>pacific and other indigenous<br>perspectives<br>are also part of those decisions and we<br>understand how they contribute<br>at the same time for those of you<br>interested in much more the physical<br>activity act of recreation and sports<br>space<br>you might be interested in the sport<br>science how are we gonna make sure the<br>crusaders keep winning<br>so while i'm even here talking about<br>waikato we know that the crusade is the<br>best team<br>what is it that makes them function well<br>what is it about their coaching their<br>training the opportunities that get<br>facilitated how do administrators run<br>sport active recreation and<br>physical activity and what are the<br>opportunities for different members of<br>our community<br>be they a person with a disability be<br>they from a<br>community that doesn't have access to<br>lots of sports because they're really<br>rural<br>what does it mean what does it mean to<br>be a skateboarder or a surfer in these<br>communities<br>and how do we help everyone get<br>opportunities to engage regardless their<br>size shape ability gender ethnicity<br>we're interested in leaders who can<br>contribute to all those things<br>so hopefully we've got something to<br>offer you what do we have to offer<br>let's start here the importance of the<br>sun in hawa is immeasurable<br>during karakia we often say kaputaki tau<br>marama<br>this means to bring something into the<br>light of day the world of life<br>to give it life the elements that<br>constitute life<br>flourish in the sun each sunrise<br>provides the opportunity to reconnect<br>with the light<br>and with knowledge at its pinnacle the<br>sun brings warmth<br>life and an understanding of the world<br>the university of waikato's bachelor of<br>health<br>signals the dawning of a new era it is<br>bringing new life and new understanding<br>to how we think about<br>health the diversity of the workforce<br>and what equitable health practices<br>look like in our communities through<br>this degree we will shed light and<br>create fresh thinking that will allow<br>graduates to enact harder<br>as a practice advocate for a broader<br>understanding of health<br>and embrace new approaches to the health<br>issues that matter most to our<br>communities<br>jau maori is embedded in all aspects of<br>the bachelor of health degree<br>while the needs and perspectives of<br>pacifica and other ethnic communities<br>are also recognised<br>a new day is dawning join us to help<br>shed a new light on health<br>and to transform our territories health<br>last year we were really proud to<br>launch the bachelor of health it's in<br>its first year this year<br>it's a degree that is focused on<br>preventative<br>holistic approaches to health we're<br>committed to<br>growing leaders in health who um<br>understand health equity<br>how culturally competent have the<br>interpersonal and collaborative skills<br>to<br>bring about change and communicate<br>effectively with our communities<br>can think critically and engage<br>for us it's about growing our workforce<br>who can contribute across the health<br>sector<br>as people in industry and the industry<br>of health diversifies<br>it's not just doctors and nurses any<br>longer when we talk about health we're<br>talking about<br>people who are leading the park strategy<br>who are leading recreation who are<br>working with elderly communities they<br>might be working in local governments<br>and ewes and indigenous populations<br>community groups private enterprise or<br>just working with individuals and<br>families<br>and for us the new degree that started<br>this year<br>really pushed us to think carefully<br>about where we need uh<br>knowledge and skill development so we<br>have two majors in here or two specified<br>programs<br>one is potent model biomedical sciences<br>so if you love the science of the body<br>understanding the body then potent motto<br>biomedical sciences within the bachelor<br>of health is the<br>program for you you get to study<br>cellular molecular biology genetics<br>biochemistry<br>infections immunology anatomy<br>pathophysiology<br>at the same time you'll understand about<br>the treaty<br>about um indigenous perspectives about<br>effective communication about data so<br>that you can<br>communicate effectively with others who<br>work in the health sector<br>potent manager which is about uplifting<br>the<br>uplifting people uh more so population<br>health is about community engagement<br>it's about people who are interested in<br>policy health management funding<br>social psychology community and<br>community approaches<br>uh and you know for people who are<br>interested in policy and<br>uh helping ewe grow their own health<br>programs then that's more of the program<br>for you<br>so a bachelor of health offers things<br>differently to different people<br>and i want to come back to that notion<br>that health is really broad<br>that there's a whole range of careers in<br>health it's more than just being the<br>person who<br>looks after the body so you could be in<br>any of these roles<br>and the blue boxes we're talking about<br>people who are working government<br>or organizations down the bottom more<br>people who are on the ground<br>hands on researchers biotesters<br>biostatisticians and the orange<br>people who might help us make decisions<br>about how we approach things<br>genetic counselors epidemiologists<br>biochemists reproductive technologists<br>all those sort of things are much more<br>about the internal workings of the body<br>and how we might develop<br>um uh<br>uh i can't even develop<br>uh solutions that are um preventative as<br>opposed to<br>just trying to fix people at the end<br>so if you're interested in um health in<br>the broader sense there's something in<br>the be health for you<br>at the same time um and tahuta<br>we have another program it's called the<br>bachelor of health sport human<br>performance<br>and this is people who are much more<br>interested in the physical activity<br>sport fitness active recreation sort of<br>spaces<br>there's three majors in here human<br>performance sciences so those of you<br>have done physical education at school<br>or by um biology at school and<br>interested in the physiology the<br>biomechanics the physio<br>psychology nutrition then that's the<br>major for you<br>you can couple that with a major in<br>sport development and coaching<br>are you the sort of person who wants to<br>help others achieve success or<br>have positive experiences then that's<br>the major for you<br>those of you are interested in teaching<br>in the future that also might be the<br>major for you<br>those of you who are interested in<br>community health who are interested in<br>questioning things about how we<br>understand what a healthy body is<br>how we might go about health promotion<br>activities how we might think about<br>illness disease and well-being at a<br>conceptual level and a practice level<br>or how we might think about digital<br>health technologies as they relate to<br>being physically active and engaging<br>in active community and creating<br>communities where<br>more people are more active more often<br>then a major in community health is<br>something for you<br>these don't have to be done alone you<br>could double major do two majors at once<br>or you could major in one of these<br>alongside a<br>different discipline and another part of<br>one of our graduates i always had<br>aspirations of representing my country<br>in sport<br>i heard that waikato had a really good<br>sports degree and their rugby team was<br>the best<br>now i have my dream job as a blackburn<br>i've had to make a lot of sacrifices<br>and train really hard to get where i am<br>today studying at waikato has given me<br>so many options for life after working<br>i hope that by sharing my story i can<br>inspire others to work hard<br>and achieve their dreams too<br>so so while stacey has gone on to become<br>a professional athlete<br>as she recognizes in that video it also<br>leaves her opportunities<br>to do other things having gained a<br>bachelor of health sport human<br>performance<br>and as it shows on this slide a career<br>um<br>out of a program like this is vast and<br>won't necessarily be one career for life<br>we all won't be professional athletes<br>but we might be a fantastic team manager<br>we might be a general manager of a<br>sporting<br>community or complex we might be a<br>director of sport<br>we might be um someone who's interested<br>in policy development sport<br>a gym instructor a coach a marketing<br>manager a sports agent<br>a exercise scientist who's doing the<br>performance analysis and breaking down<br>the game of any<br>any uh team if you want them to perform<br>or a buy mechanism working with a<br>swimmer to get their straight right<br>there's a whole range of careers that<br>can come out of a bachelor of health<br>sport human performance<br>it's about the choices you make and what<br>interests you most<br>so from tehuataki wira you should come<br>and join us<br>in our programs if you're passionate<br>about making a difference in our<br>community<br>um whether that's for their well-being<br>or for their
