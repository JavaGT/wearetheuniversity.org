they<br>teach<br>us<br>hi my name is dave nichols and i'm here<br>to talk about computer science<br>and that's mainly a new three-year<br>degree<br>the bachelor of computer science so this<br>is a new qualification<br>aimed at producing a course which is<br>really in depth and in breadth like a<br>comprehensive coverage of computer<br>science topics<br>so what you'll find in this degree will<br>be a lot of<br>exposure to different technologies a lot<br>of programming to<br>cover the range of applications that<br>computing can deliver<br>so you'll do web and mobile databases<br>things like the internet of things<br>you'll care about scalability<br>and security about writing algorithms to<br>learn new things in an artificial<br>intelligence sense so basically you'll<br>get a lot of programming a lot of coding<br>and you'll also have some content around<br>ensuring that the<br>code and the applications and the<br>devices that you contribute to<br>are friendly they're user-friendly and<br>can actually<br>deliver effective solutions for people<br>so this degree has a core and then two<br>specified programs one which is that<br>kind of combination of software and<br>hardware<br>that we call our embedded systems and<br>then<br>a set of papers which adds to the core<br>to enable you to think about dealing<br>with all the data that all of these<br>different devices and all of the<br>different aspects of our digital society<br>produce<br>so that's our kind of core degree<br>and there are also a couple of other<br>options we have a four-year<br>pcms honours degree and this is mainly<br>distinguished with a large research-led<br>project<br>in the fourth and final year and then if<br>you're interested in balancing computing<br>with<br>another subject such as say mathematics<br>or maybe one of the design majors that<br>you'll hear about in a little while<br>then the bsc in computer science in<br>three years allows you to create these<br>double majors<br>in fact with computer science and any<br>other subject<br>and all of these degrees lead on to<br>potentially<br>higher degrees at the masters level in<br>particular we have the masters of<br>information technology which is very<br>strong industry placement focus and one<br>focused on cyber security<br>so here hopefully are some videos of<br>hi my name is rowan simmons i studied at<br>the university of waikato in 2014<br>now my research involves looking at the<br>internet of things or iot<br>uh<br>currently i'm a maori student at the<br>university of waikato<br>um and i'm looking towards a christian<br>computer science<br>focal point of my research is how best<br>to apply coca-cola<br>in a computer science context i chose to<br>study at the university of waikato<br>because of my passion for<br>software development and decided to<br>pursue<br>a master's of science degree after i<br>graduated and i joined the<br>campus atmosphere so much i challenged<br>myself further<br>by contributing research<br>within the computer science discipline<br>the highlights for me while studying at<br>the university of waikato has been the<br>opportunity<br>to apply my skills such as mentoring<br>students<br>and assisting tutors and computer papers<br>which i find that very<br>rewarding helping others another<br>highlight is the support systems<br>available to<br>students at all levels of study<br>being modern myself i'm thankful for the<br>support<br>i've received and urged future students<br>to take full advantage so if you're<br>thinking of studying whatever<br>deliverable or discipline that you need<br>at the university of waikato is a<br>stunning place to be<br>katie<br>hi my name is claire timpani for the<br>creative thinkers and the problem<br>solvers this is the degree for you<br>the bachelor of design is a three-year<br>degree with four different majors<br>interface for the student who wants to<br>create websites<br>mobile apps and the future of<br>interaction<br>communication more than logos print and<br>advertising<br>this major provides you with the skills<br>to be a modern graphic designer<br>media where wellywood meets hollywood<br>you'll design moving and media<br>experiences for new audiences<br>industrial embracing three-dimensional<br>product design<br>so you can solve everyday problems in<br>our fast-paced new world<br>each of the majors can work on their own<br>or you can combine any two of them<br>we would love you love to have you join<br>us to study design<br>students<br>everybody my name is hazel and i'm a<br>master's student here at the university<br>of waikato<br>i studied my undergraduate here too in a<br>bachelor of design which i majored in<br>communication design<br>and media design during that time i was<br>able to do some pretty awesome projects<br>here<br>for my degree project i made a app<br>designed for plant-based athletes to<br>maintain their dietary requirements<br>throughout their training<br>after graduation i was lucky enough to<br>receive a summer research scholarship<br>which was an awesome opportunity<br>it gave me the opportunity to work with<br>the indigenous<br>studies department here at the<br>university of waikato which was awesome<br>because i was able to<br>experience a lot of different culture<br>which i had never experienced before<br>during this time i helped create a<br>fijian cultural app<br>which is then going to be released into<br>fiji which is pretty awesome<br>um yeah so if you want to try out that<br>stuff come to work as well<br>i am now completing my masters of design<br>so for that i<br>am looking at doing my thesis on<br>vr which is pretty cool there's a lot of<br>awesome tools you get to play with here<br>at waikato<br>and you get some really awesome<br>opportunities so come to waikato<br>choose waikato you won't regret it<br>hey guys my name is benedict i am a<br>bachelor of design student here at<br>waikato<br>majoring in communication design and<br>minoring in media design<br>so throughout the course of three years<br>of my study here at white council i have<br>created projects<br>such as the postcards so as you can see<br>over here it might have been sent to<br>your school<br>and i've also done posters for my other<br>classes with this one<br>it talks about the turtles and how we<br>can save them and this one is for a<br>media class and i created a poster for<br>it<br>saying that the children are our future<br>so we should follow them<br>i have also created an app for my<br>internship for gelhertz so for<br>kelleher i entered for them for 12 weeks<br>and they have asked me to create a<br>virtual app<br>for the system that they were preparing<br>to do so if you want this great<br>experience<br>uh hello there i'm daniel from the<br>mathematics department<br>why study mathematics at waikato<br>well there's a number of reasons first<br>is it's an absolutely beautiful subject<br>it's mind-blowing it's incredibly<br>creative<br>and most of all in the current era where<br>truth seems to be a disposable commodity<br>it's one of the few subjects where you<br>can be absolutely certain<br>whether something is correct or false<br>so typically our graduates are<br>very highly paid they're one of the most<br>sought after in industry<br>and the reason for that is companies<br>really value analytical skills<br>and mathematics can really help you to<br>develop those skills<br>so typically our students they work in<br>maybe<br>industry finance epidemiology which is<br>very current at the moment<br>space science all over the shop and not<br>to be sniffed at is<br>the education sector where um<br>there's currently a shortage of stem<br>teachers in new zealand and that's<br>certainly<br>an area we need to grow so here are a<br>couple of uh<br>short videos from some of our recent<br>graduates<br>hi my name is laura and i'm in my final<br>year of maths at the university of<br>microsoft<br>i think maths is such a cool subject<br>because it has so many applications<br>from compsci to finance to my case<br>biomass<br>i've always wanted to help people in my<br>job and i consider becoming a doctor<br>that's why after i graduate i plan to<br>work in the field of methodical medicine<br>so many areas<br>from cancer modeling all the way through<br>to computational neuroscience<br>use maths actually at the moment i'm<br>researching how electrical stimulation<br>of the brain<br>also show muscles to move hopefully my<br>research will help people with head<br>strokes<br>i'm so excited for my future and i love<br>studying maths here at white house<br>my name is dale i graduated from waikato<br>with a major in data analytics<br>and i'm now a data scientist for city<br>transportation at the hamilton city<br>council<br>my role is to enable council to make<br>more informed decisions and transport<br>projects by transforming data into<br>insights<br>as well as making it more accessible to<br>the community<br>what i love about my work is making a<br>real difference to my city through the<br>use of data<br>from prediction models of card trips to<br>classifying different modes of transport<br>the data analytics major at waikido gave<br>me the skills and techniques for making<br>sense of the vast amounts of data we<br>have at council<br>and helped prepare me for my career in<br>all right hi everyone i'm panos i'm a<br>professional software engineer and a<br>researcher<br>and this is my stack of raspberry pi's i<br>guess you'll have to come to wiki to<br>learn more about that<br>all right software is everywhere it's in<br>your phones it's on the cloud in<br>aircraft<br>in iot and other smart and embedded<br>devices the thing is it needs to be made<br>correctly<br>it needs to be safe and secure and run<br>with high performance<br>a bachelor of engineering in software<br>engineering will make you a chartered<br>software engineer and an expert<br>in software and computer systems<br>you will learn to design and develop<br>large and complex projects<br>as part of large teams of other software<br>engineers and eventually<br>oversee these projects and assure their<br>quality<br>perhaps you'll even rise to a level of<br>technical project management<br>manager or inform your own startup our<br>four-year<br>bachelor of engineering software<br>engineering is accredited by engineering<br>new zealand<br>and it's supported by its technical<br>interest group i.t engineers<br>you have to be careful here this is an<br>international recognition<br>through the washington accord this will<br>allow you to work as a charter software<br>engineer<br>around the globe crucially because we<br>have numerous internships<br>you will be able to acquire real working<br>experience uh<br>in conjunction with our industrial<br>partners<br>finally it can also unlock our graduate<br>masters and phd students which were<br>uh previously described in the computer<br>science section<br>you will now hear from our two uh recent<br>graduates one of them is actually a<br>student of mine<br>and i'm looking forward to seeing you in<br>the university of waikato and here's a<br>hey everyone i'm rhys compton i studied<br>a bachelor's<br>of engineering majoring in software<br>engineering at the university of waikato<br>i graduated in december 2019 and ever<br>since then<br>i've been working at rosia systems which<br>is<br>a great agritech company based out in<br>when i started there i came on as a<br>research intern<br>doing a project around sheet counting<br>using ai<br>since then i've been working as a<br>software engineer on a range of<br>other projects and the agricultural and<br>horticultural sector<br>after i get a uni i also published a<br>paper<br>in an international conference and i've<br>also been the awardee of<br>a fulbright scholarship which means i'll<br>be traveling to the states in 2021 to do<br>my master's<br>in computer science at new york<br>university hi my name is dylan nixon<br>i'm a graduate software engineer from<br>the university of waikato<br>and i'm now working as a research<br>programmer<br>in the hakatori group within the<br>university<br>my current work involves me creating<br>specialized hardware<br>which will then be introduced into a<br>wearable<br>such as the shirt for forestry workers<br>out in the field<br>with the overall goal of reducing the<br>number of incidents<br>that occur in forests in new zealand<br>this project started as my honors<br>project as a proof of concept that this<br>could work<br>this is now developed into my<br>work as a research programmer where i'm<br>developing this<br>hardware and the software behind it and<br>then testing it on myself<br>to ensure that it works under the<br>conditions we needed to<br>i'll be continuing this project on into<br>my masters where we will<br>test this on actual forestry workers in<br>the field<br>to ensure that this could be a viable<br>option<br>thank you for joining us you can find<br>more about us on our website or you can<br>just drop by and visit us<br>if you're in the region you have seen a<br>lot of the projects that our students<br>are doing you've seen five of us<br>as we're teaching in the school and at<br>the end i want to show you some more of<br>my colleagues<br>and they will talk about some of the<br>research projects that they're doing and<br>the industry collaborations<br>i ensure that safety critical systems<br>such as<br>medical devices and avionics work as<br>expected<br>i engineer systems to work with address<br>maori sovereignty of maori data while<br>researching maori specific<br>software engineering methodologies<br>because we work closely with businesses<br>even if the students are at university<br>they may get the opportunity to work<br>with a company to develop an i.t<br>solution<br>that solves a real world maths physics<br>and supercomputers to develop models<br>that help us<br>understand the interaction between the<br>sun and the interstellar<br>i investigate visual design and user<br>experience solutions to information<br>seeking and information use problems<br>i use these findings to design better<br>ways to visualize and present<br>information to people<br>in mobile and on-the-go situations i<br>worked in cybersecurity where i design<br>and evaluate<br>anomaly detection tools to secure our<br>software applications and networks from<br>malicious<br>turbulence is everywhere you can find it<br>in the rivers in the sea in the ocean<br>in the air and even in space and that's<br>what i study<br>here everyone my name is paul and the<br>data analysis that i do<br>can be used to help predict the outcomes<br>of elections i investigate how systems<br>manage themselves automatically and i<br>oversee the design and architecture of<br>novel cloud applications and tools<br>in conjunction with local and<br>international industrial i work on<br>software verification<br>which allows us to prove mathematically<br>that our software is safe and secure<br>when we design a book a website a chair<br>or a movie we make our world<br>more enjoyable and beautiful designing<br>we make people's lives better<br>i work on bayesian methods bayesian<br>methods can be used for modeling complex<br>events such as<br>pandemics stock markets lost aircraft i<br>do research<br>into novel interfaces that let you find<br>and manage digital content whatever form<br>that it might be in<br>want to find a song but don't know its<br>name then maybe you want to try my query<br>by having the interface<br>i research safety critical systems and<br>how we can ensure they work as expected<br>using model-based testing and model<br>checking the aim of information<br>visualization<br>is to present information in such a way<br>that we're able to extract the relevant<br>features<br>for a given context and perhaps gain<br>insight<br>that would not have been possible<br>without that particular visualization<br>i'm a cosmologist<br>i study things like the big bang black<br>holes and sustainable design<br>focuses on the development of products<br>both<br>tangible and virtual such as services or<br>digital artifacts<br>it looks after all aspects that support<br>human life<br>from the efficient use of resources to<br>the protection of the environment<br>and the society as a whole<br>data stream mining making sure your<br>machine learning models stay<br>relevant and accurate while the world<br>changes<br>which it always does my research teaches<br>computers to learn from data<br>so they can better manage the world i<br>research how software intensive systems<br>should be designed to assure people's<br>safety in high risk working environments<br>via automated detection the great<br>english mathematician alan turing<br>managed to work out a test to see if a<br>machine was intelligent<br>and he did this even before there were<br>digital computers<br>his idea was that an intelligent machine<br>could answer<br>questions in a way that was<br>indistinguishable from the way people<br>answer questions<br>i'm interested in machines that can<br>answer questions but even more<br>i'm interested in machines that can ask</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
