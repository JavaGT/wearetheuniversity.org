and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hopefully there's a few of you out there<br>watching us<br>and the deputy vice chancellor maori<br>office working on mighty student<br>achievement<br>this is my first trimester starting my<br>graduate diploma<br>of multi-indigenous studies within the<br>faculty of maori and indigenous<br>obviously<br>and i'm the co-president of te karu the<br>student association for the maori and<br>indigenous studies<br>which is in the maori indigenous uh<br>faculty<br>beautiful uh so the way this uh session<br>is gonna run is we're gonna<br>go through a few mythbusters that you<br>may have about university<br>um my awesome student panelists are<br>gonna bust those myths for you<br>uh and then we'll sort of let you guys<br>know a few about a few of the services<br>that we offer<br>uh when you join the whanau at<br>all so we'll do oh also we've got the<br>chat function working so if you do want<br>to ask us any part time we can hopefully<br>answer them<br>throughout the session let's jump into<br>it myth number one<br>for myself and my experience um there<br>are similarities but<br>it is actually quite a widely different<br>experience<br>um so as you can see there's no bells so<br>it's your responsibility to get to class<br>on time<br>um sometimes that works sometimes it<br>doesn't um<br>we have semesters not siestas<br>which is pretty much instead of having<br>separate terms you've got<br>a couple smashed together um flexible<br>timetable<br>so you've got like classes where you'll<br>have maybe one<br>session of the day or one lecture and<br>then that's it<br>and then others you're gonna have like<br>three classes and one straight after<br>each other<br>and so that makes it exciting i guess<br>you never know what you're going to get<br>till you sign<br>up and your class sizes so you either<br>get<br>little as ones or you'll get ginormous<br>like one of my papers is currently there<br>is<br>which i think leads into the next busted<br>faster<br>crazy so all my classes will be crammed<br>with people so as kawa said<br>um it's actually a myth sometimes that's<br>our largest lecture theater there on<br>campus<br>it's only if you're taking a big paper<br>with heaps of students such as maybe a<br>psychology paper<br>um where you'll have a class like that<br>but the majority of your papers and your<br>classes will not be that big<br>um and the beautiful thing too is if<br>you're still looking for that more um<br>one-on-one learning uh then after your<br>classes you have tutorials we can go and<br>like meet with your tutors<br>people who have done the papers before<br>and you can actually have that<br>more in-depth discussion about what<br>you've been studying and at the moment<br>obviously with<br>everything happening around covert<br>waikato has offered<br>it's their paper papers online too so<br>there's the option to work from home<br>just in case you feel safer at home so<br>let's bust<br>that message all right<br>number three it'll be hard to make<br>friends like this depends what you're<br>not just easiest place to make friends<br>at university because it's not like high<br>school you have<br>sick classes and it's pretty much the<br>same people i go to one class<br>i know 10 people i've got another class<br>i know two people and there's so many<br>more people that i don't know<br>that you can make friends with that<br>makes sense yeah but also inclusive of<br>the student opu<br>uh especially for within maiki waikato i<br>think there's nine different students<br>all food depending on what faculty are<br>in<br>his chances to make friends with all of<br>those activities they do sports days<br>their myki waikato throws<br>all your classes all your tutorials and<br>everything else that you want to sign up<br>for<br>at the university so making friends it's<br>the easiest<br>thing in the entire world you'll<br>probably think<br>after your first year heck i've got too<br>many friends<br>time to cut a few uh just kidding easy<br>to make friends<br>that's the bastards myth number four<br>it's going to be too<br>hard for me university is going to be<br>too hard um so when you come to waikato<br>especially<br>it's pretty much as i say to everyone<br>who comes here it's impossible to fail<br>there are so many services out there<br>especially catered towards our maori<br>pharma<br>our maori students who come to waikato<br>that um<br>yeah it's hard to fail because there's<br>we have our maori mentoring units<br>that offer our academic support there's<br>other academic support out there there's<br>career advice there's scholarship advice<br>um there's advocacy what else is there<br>friends friends friends mental health<br>mental health health stuff<br>if you've got a question they've got a<br>staff member dedicated to that one<br>question<br>yep no it's this there's a staff member<br>out there for<br>anything you need and the support<br>service um<br>offered for our mighty students in<br>particular is<br>i can't have a life outside of<br>university let me tell you<br>right now of course you can i don't know<br>what where this myth came from but it's<br>a<br>full lie uh you can have part-time mahi<br>it does test you a bit but it is doable<br>i mean these get-togethers<br>informal and formal<br>um but now uni is what you make of it so<br>you do what you want really yep yeah oh<br>fortunate enough to run a little<br>business alongside uh<br>do my studies as well and also i have a<br>job within the university tutoring so<br>which is 20 hours a week and i have<br>plenty of times to have naps in the<br>afternoon<br>it's not like you go to school nine to<br>three every day then you have stuff<br>after school it's like maybe i have<br>two classes on tuesday and i'll have<br>three classes on thursday<br>one on friday then you're done for the<br>week so there's actually a lot more time<br>and it's all about how much money you<br>put into those papers it's going to be<br>your results there's no one<br>chasing you back up but you can't have a<br>life outside university<br>as long as you're staying on track with<br>your studies because that's the number<br>one reason why you want we weekends<br>we want you guys here to pass your<br>papers and become<br>academics and go out and change the<br>world<br>yeah absolutely balance is key so as<br>long as you've got your your studies in<br>check<br>your work in check your social life in<br>check and you're spending<br>i don't know you're not looking after<br>each side especially your social life<br>because while you're<br>at university you're studying um it's<br>good to have a good support circle<br>around you<br>but again like my two colleagues here<br>said focusing on that studies is also<br>very important<br>so busted<br>right good nights quick shout out to<br>paula who's tuning in from chile kyoto<br>okay mighty student support so at the<br>university of waikato we have a maori<br>mentoring unit in each faculty or school<br>um so they are listed all there on the<br>screen hopefully you can see them<br>um essentially our mighty mentoring<br>units are there made up for our<br>multimeter coordinators<br>we call them the aunties of the<br>university because they're just like<br>going to see your auntie<br>but they employ student mentors maori<br>student mentors who have done the same<br>papers of you<br>um who have been through the same sort<br>of courses and know<br>how to pass pretty much so they're there<br>to support you with any academic support<br>you need<br>um but and they're also there to support<br>you if you need any pastoral care that's<br>that means just having a chat um going<br>in for yarn telling them about your lows<br>your highlights<br>um and then also your procedural matters<br>too so if you need help applying for<br>scholarships ew grants extensions<br>withdrawals whatever it may be our money<br>mentoring units are there as a first<br>point of call<br>um to support you along your study they<br>also have heaps of cool prizes heaps of<br>competitions<br>heaps of free stuff heaps of kai<br>and i always tell uh students go to all<br>the free kai because<br>that's that's what we're here for<br>anything dead<br>you pay for all of this along with your<br>um fees so<br>do engage with the stuff it don't feel<br>like hey only done people go to the<br>mentors<br>because i go to the mentors yes<br>absolutely<br>so even if you're a student who is doing<br>well too and you just want to season up<br>your writing to just get that from that<br>a to the a plus that's what they're<br>there for as well yeah<br>and they're not just there for your<br>academic stuff if you think man i've got<br>a problem at home<br>or i've got some mental health stuff<br>sort of coming up go see them go talk to<br>them and like nathan said<br>man those are your aunties and your<br>aunties always know what's best for you<br>absolutely and we also have our unit<br>over in our tadanga campus as well and<br>at the moment all our money mentoring<br>units offering online support too<br>in case you just need you want to stay<br>home feel a bit more safe um they're<br>maori student associations so i'm<br>actually going to hand it over to these<br>yeah cool you'll see it on there i'm not<br>an indigenous studies it's actually a<br>first<br>for maori indigenous studies and what we<br>do is offer academic<br>social and mental support for all of the<br>uh students within ifmas<br>uh yeah we do stuff like hiding out<br>there hiding outside the mighty<br>nazi we celebrated the<br>uh the new emoji new year together with<br>the hotapu<br>uh through friday nights game nights and<br>just allow their fuckfun<br>tonga and their sort of friendships uh<br>to<br>flourish within your university career<br>that's just one of the raw and there's<br>eights<br>so most of these rules are faculty<br>specific<br>um so whatever area you want to study in<br>there's pretty much guaranteed to be at<br>all before you if not<br>let's just start one why not um<br>so we have terangangaku for management<br>for law to matu kitty for education and<br>health sport and human performance<br>wow what a long name titanium hakuturi<br>environmental science and geography kodu<br>stem which is for the sciences tech<br>engineering<br>yep science technology engineering<br>mathematics and that's also for pacifica<br>students as well<br>yes and we also have mana aki<br>ki tauranga which is for our today and<br>the students over there um<br>so the one up there that's kind of<br>different is tiwalda which kind of<br>is pam faculty which caters to kind of<br>everyone<br>and then all the student associations<br>kind of have their own little<br>get-togethers<br>um whether it's just sports games<br>each block yeah if you know about h<br>block you know the no whanau<br>um but yeah and there's just many other<br>aspects they kind of become your home<br>away from home<br>while you're at uni in your other whanau<br>absolutely and as luke mentioned it's<br>the perfect way to make friends<br>make a whanau heaps of opportunities<br>heaps of<br>free stuff kaitahi and they're just<br>there to have your back to you while you<br>go through your studies because chances<br>are if you're struggling with something<br>there's going to be another mate out<br>there who's struggling with it too so<br>connections<br>favorite part about uni what is your<br>favorite<br>part been about university luke moss oh<br>i'll talk about that<br>photo of me in the book<br>my first year so maybe the kai has been<br>the best part for me<br>my favorite part of uni is making<br>connections with people<br>um for dare i say it i left high school<br>thinking<br>he's going to be my friends forever and<br>i came to university<br>i hope your friends aren't watching my<br>high school friends i still love you<br>but i've made these connections at<br>universally that i'll like<br>glue this is like i'll try to escape the<br>glue followed me<br>i think yeah back to the question<br>favorite part of university<br>making friends and making these long<br>lasting relationships and connections<br>with people<br>that i know that i'm going to have<br>throughout life and um yeah i think the<br>connection is the biggest part it's<br>touching<br>beautiful thank you a few tears out<br>there<br>um no my answer is pretty much exactly<br>the same as luke's<br>uh yep thought my high school mates were<br>it and that was us<br>um sorry funs but um<br>yeah like luke you know the connections<br>that you create here<br>while you're at uni are kind of lifelong<br>ones<br>if you think about it because they go<br>through<br>your lowest of lows with you and they're<br>at your highest of highs as well<br>um so i can't think of anything better<br>than that<br>adding to the uni experience yeah yep<br>hey i'm along my old answer to you um<br>graduation is an amazing experience<br>that's all we're here to<br>to get our tohu um so<br>to go and graduate there because you can<br>bring your whole whanau<br>your whole um kappa if you need to do a<br>young bracket but they're there to do a<br>haka for you<br>and just show them or they're there to<br>show you that they love you<br>and as you walk across this stage you<br>realize you look out into the crowd and<br>you realize<br>you're holding your toe and you're like<br>this is what i've this is what it's all<br>about it was all worth it<br>maori student program so in our office<br>of the deputy vice chancellor maori<br>we offer a number of programs these<br>three are probably more relevant to you<br>guys<br>um so te hononga akiba on the left which<br>is<br>i'm currently working for luke is a tour<br>on the program um essentially when when<br>we were allowed to travel the program<br>took<br>uh student mighty students overseas to<br>north asia southeast asia<br>latin america luke u went to japan he<br>went to japan<br>it's an amazing program to build maori<br>business capability<br>in our students and get to look at<br>international markets overseas<br>it's still running going ahead this year<br>um it's just a bit different online<br>uh still an awesome program in the<br>middle there is te kahuiber<br>it's a new program that we have up and<br>running for our first year as we come to<br>waikato<br>it's a transition program so just that<br>when you come to waikato<br>as a first year if you don't know anyone<br>it's a perfect way to meet you<br>you meet new people but also just get<br>all the tools<br>kill the rest of the time in university<br>i guess and finally on the third<br>one there is a maori leadership program<br>i was fortunate enough to go through<br>that program back in 2017. hey you're in<br>that photo<br>oh it's so big but it's an amazing<br>program i'm still friends with a lot of<br>those people<br>definitely best mates but we get to<br>travel around<br>talk to different maori leaders and take<br>different parts of what<br>has made them successful and put it now<br>in kitty again it's a there are heaps of<br>opportunities<br>to to get around so waikato you can<br>still explore these<br>amazing regions around aotearoa and<br>internationally so<br>um yeah these those are just a few other<br>ones we offer here<br>um but yeah awesome programs<br>um very good programs they might be the<br>make or break of your university career<br>and<br>you know when you're thinking heck i'm<br>just can't get it through one of these<br>programs might be the ones<br>and you go hey i'm going to do it<br>absolutely yeah yeah don't hold me<br>yep so as we've sort of touched on<br>there's so many events at university<br>this is<br>part of the reason you'll love<br>university um<br>there's you can see in the top there's<br>tiwala doing a um cultural hour or maybe<br>just<br>a performance um there's chances of the<br>kabaka<br>we've got kaitahi down the bottom there<br>on the bottom right is our kingitanga<br>day<br>um chances to volunteer we've got hakuna<br>kina up in the top left<br>um so there's just heaps of events to<br>get involved um<br>this is how you meet heaps of different<br>people um and i'd say<br>these are what makes university the<br>funnest for you to<br>yeah definitely yeah any events<br>highlights for you guys any events you<br>go i'll just go to the wall<br>one the three two the fun is three you<br>meet heaps of people<br>four that i mentioned my finances<br>uh finally if you want to know more<br>about<br>what we do universally you'll see a lot<br>of kawa actually if you go to these<br>social media

have all done we've all done it<br>yes we have<br>um which is quite a i guess high<br>high or fast-paced i think that's<br>probably the better word fast-paced<br>learning<br>um where you do your 100 level papers 30<br>or 200 and 300<br>within one year um and you come out<br>pretty much being able to call it all<br>really<br>it just depends on how much you apply<br>yourself absolutely um but in saying<br>that to you<br>and many of our students they just had a<br>good idea so there's heaps of<br>opportunities to<br>do well learn more outside of just the<br>classes<br>um i have seen a question come through<br>from tilly if there's any scholarship<br>specific info for te tohu party i can't<br>exactly say i know there<br>was but there is also a faculty of maori<br>and indigenous studies
