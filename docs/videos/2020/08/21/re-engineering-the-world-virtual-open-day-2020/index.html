university<br>of waikato<br>by becoming an engineer<br>so there's a lot of different reasons as<br>to why<br>you might want to become an engineer but<br>perhaps<br>one of the most motivating factors is<br>the fact that<br>in the world today we face some of the<br>greatest challenges<br>that we ever have in the history of the<br>world<br>let's have a little look at some of the<br>snapshots of what we face<br>up the road at huntley we have our<br>coal-fired power station<br>which has been there for maybe 40 years<br>now<br>but today we want to go to 100 renewable<br>so how do we do that how do you<br>contribute to that solution<br>maybe you think that this is the answer<br>that we can<br>put solar power everywhere<br>however in order to replace huntley with<br>solar power<br>we need the size of hamilton in land<br>space<br>so how do we do this or perhaps you want<br>to design a beautiful building<br>you want to be part of the construction<br>or<br>the design but how do we make sure that<br>this building<br>doesn't turn into our next waste<br>and landfill how do we make sure that<br>these amazing technologies such as the<br>tesla vehicle<br>is built in a sustainable way so that<br>we don't end up with industry just<br>causing more pollution<br>how do we adopt the concepts that we<br>have that are out there<br>smart cities how do we get everything to<br>integrate together<br>how do we get the systems that are<br>built the infrastructure the civil<br>infrastructures the electrical all of<br>these different components to work<br>together<br>to have what we want to achieve in the<br>future<br>or maybe you're interested in how<br>robotics can<br>contribute to the solution in the future<br>or perhaps materials and how novel<br>ways of reformulating materials from<br>sustainable<br>sources in order to produce the things<br>that we need<br>so the big question is we are here today<br>but where are we going to be tomorrow<br>and how<br>professional engineering at the<br>university of wakato is all about<br>making a difference it's about how you<br>can learn<br>the basic skills develop the<br>professional<br>methods and technical nouns in order for<br>you to become<br>the future leaders of our industry and<br>so<br>we can formulate this as a very simple<br>equation<br>that you plus our bachelor of<br>engineering<br>plus our work placements plus our<br>diploma<br>can make you into a future leader<br>so let's explore this a little bit<br>further<br>what does it mean to be a professional<br>engineer<br>what are the attributes of a<br>professional engineer<br>well one is we we like to see the big<br>picture we like to take a stand back<br>and not just ask how to design<br>something but why are we designing it in<br>the first place we like to ask the tough<br>questions<br>how is it that uh how is it that we're<br>going to get from where we are today<br>to a sustainable future we think in a<br>way<br>that not just do we measure a problem<br>but we try to design out a problem so we<br>think in the way<br>of design we apply fundamental technical<br>knowledge<br>in order to understand our systems<br>understand<br>our buildings understand all the<br>infrastructure that we have<br>learn to work through budgets and to<br>keep things within<br>economic controls to ensure that we stay<br>viable<br>we have a very strong practical ability<br>so that we don't just sit at a desk in a<br>computer all day<br>designing but we're out in factories<br>we're<br>out on the roads we're on the bridges<br>we're trying to make it a better place<br>through our practical skills<br>we also are involved with managing<br>people making sure that<br>the technicians or the scientists or<br>the lawyers understand what is the<br>engineering<br>requirements for various projects<br>we work in very diverse teams they can<br>include<br>engineers they can include accountants<br>they can include<br>marketing people management all of the<br>different disciplines<br>that you can study here at waikato the<br>engineers<br>are part of that we have to learn to be<br>very clear communicators how do we<br>take a solution that is technically<br>sound<br>and to deliver it into a disruptive<br>sustainable design in the future<br>we have to be creative and innovative<br>because doing the same things we have in<br>the past<br>will only lead to the same things that<br>at the university of waikato we have<br>four pillars<br>of engineering we have the civil<br>engineering<br>chemical mechanical and electrical<br>engineering<br>we also have four additional programs<br>around software environmental<br>mechatronics<br>and materials and process these eight<br>programs<br>cover all of the fundamental areas of<br>what does our professional degrees look<br>like<br>well as you traverse our website and try<br>to understand all the different<br>structures of our degrees this is our<br>engineering one<br>essentially we have a fairly common<br>first year among the very different<br>disciplines so you learn to interact<br>with<br>students who are interested in different<br>areas<br>and then we have common papers which<br>deal with<br>big issues such as the environment<br>society<br>economics and also what it means to be a<br>professional<br>we also have about several design papers<br>where we learn<br>to apply all these fundamental knowledge<br>that we<br>learn in other papers and apply it to<br>design<br>in order to get better solutions<br>we also have connected into our degree<br>800 hours of work placement<br>this is where we go out into we send our<br>students out into<br>the workplace into companies such as<br>fonterra or og fiber solutions<br>or pfs and many other companies<br>where they can gain uh an experience<br>of working with practicing professional<br>engineers<br>in that 800 hours you not only get to<br>interact with other professional<br>engineers but you also see how<br>management works<br>how other economists<br>accountants and lawyers can play an<br>important part in<br>so now you might wonder how is it that<br>you can<br>enter into the waikato program there are<br>three main entries<br>the first entry at the bottom of the<br>screen<br>is around meeting the criteria that we<br>have<br>on our website and if you can<br>also get merit and excellence<br>endorsement we highly recommend<br>that you can enter into the entering<br>first year directly<br>if you're a student that perhaps has<br>been highly affected by covert<br>or perhaps you have some holes in your<br>understanding of<br>basic of math and physics then<br>in that case you might want to enter our<br>jump start program<br>in order for you to just have a little<br>bit more time<br>that you can learn the basics of maths<br>and physics<br>the jump start program runs in january<br>and february<br>before the engineering first year<br>if you're in the boat where you haven't<br>quite met the entry requirements for the<br>bachelor of engineering with honours<br>perhaps the best pathway is for you to<br>consider doing<br>a certificate in university preparation<br>where you can focus on<br>subjects that relate to engineering such<br>as maths<br>we've already discussed a little bit<br>about work placements<br>but one of the highlights from work<br>placements that a lot of students<br>get is the fact that after their work<br>placement they can<br>translate that into a capstone project<br>or eventually into a graduate position<br>and so this is just one of the many<br>examples where our students have worked<br>over the years at robotics plus<br>over in tauranga at robotics plus<br>they are in the business of trying to<br>automate the horticulture<br>area where you have automatic fruit<br>picking<br>or trying to just pick<br>avocados or kiwi fruit from the trees in<br>order to<br>you might ask the question that do you<br>want to be an<br>engineer or do you want to be a manager<br>well our answer is<br>why not be both and we have the<br>solution to this many engineers<br>can also make great managers but they<br>need to have<br>compared to just their technical now<br>one of the areas they need to learn is<br>things like leadership<br>and so how do we get this into our<br>engineers<br>well we also we have a co-current<br>diploma<br>in engineering professional practice<br>where you can learn<br>you can see here in a simple diagram<br>that shows you the difference between<br>what we would call a low level manager<br>and a top level manager a low level<br>manager is just focused on the technical<br>skills<br>trying to put a straight line on a piece<br>of paper<br>do a few design calculations whereas<br>what we want to teach you here at<br>waikato is not just<br>a straight line or a rote learning sort<br>of calculation<br>but how do you see the big picture how<br>do you elevate your knowledge<br>to go from a low level management type<br>of<br>view to a high level management type of<br>view how do you see the big picture<br>and this is where the diploma in<br>engineering professional practice can<br>help<br>so let me just give you a little bit of<br>an insight to what<br>our students get up to and how<br>professional engineering looks<br>in the first year one of the very first<br>activities you'll<br>encounter is the boat race in the boat<br>race we<br>try to gather some rubbish and<br>clean up our lake and so our students<br>build boats<br>in their first year course construct it<br>design it<br>and then go and test it on the waters<br>and they have a competition to see<br>who is who can clean up the lake the<br>best<br>in our second year design papers we have<br>a whole range of different<br>activities in our chemical engineering<br>program<br>we have a a chemical car where<br>you have to design a car that is powered<br>in civil engineering one of the<br>challenges is to build a bridge<br>and then to try and test the bridge with<br>different weights you can see here<br>in our short video from our engineering<br>design show last year<br>how the different teams were had<br>different structures to their bridge<br>different trusses and different designs<br>in third year we continue to progress<br>and try to get more design solutions<br>such as the one here<br>where you've got a mechatronic solution<br>trying to<br>maneuver around and in different<br>directions<br>in our mechanical engineering field<br>this is showing one of the incredible<br>projects where<br>students had to design a little<br>contraption in order to<br>go up a ramp at turn a corner<br>another one of our projects that we have<br>here going on is around<br>uh our close collaboration with uh<br>robotics plus and so one of the projects<br>was around cucumber<br>collecting and then sorting you can see<br>here<br>one of the prototypes from our students<br>where they were taking a cucumber<br>bringing it over to a conveyor belt and<br>then<br>releasing that cucumber onto the<br>in your final year of the bachelor of<br>engineering<br>you must do a range of capstone projects<br>that relate to<br>either research or design or both<br>these projects range from<br>all the way from trying to deal with<br>issues<br>to do with design of factories through<br>to<br>design of robotics through to algorithms<br>and software engineering<br>there is a whole range of different<br>activities that we do and<br>many of the projects are connected with<br>our local industry<br>and trying to address some of the<br>problems they see in their<br>we also have a strong graduate program<br>but you can see here<br>one of our graduate design videos around<br>trying to collect various<br>fruit in this case it was kiwifruit you<br>can see here<br>the complexity of trying to grab a kiwi<br>fruit with a robot<br>do the design of both the mechanics<br>and also the software design in order to<br>ensure that the<br>kiwi fruit prick picker is very gentle<br>but at the same time very quick and<br>so just to wrap up this session<br>if you want to know more there are some<br>many there are some additional<br>engagements that you can come to first<br>of all we have our engineering design<br>show<br>that is coming up in october and schools<br>and school kids are most welcome<br>to join us we'll be holding it here<br>at the gallagher center and it will run<br>across three days those three days<br>we'll have sessions from about 9 30 to<br>12 30 each day<br>in which you can come and experience<br>a little taste of what we have to offer<br>at waikato<br>eng.wakato.ac.nz<br>through that website you can learn about<br>all our different programs<br>you can learn about the degree<br>structures and all the mechanics of<br>of uh how engineering at waikoto works<br>you can also find several reasons that<br>set waikoto apart from other engineering<br>schools<br>in new zealand and lastly<br>in just a few weeks from now we have our<br>launch your career in engineering<br>evenings where you can come to the<br>waikato university<br>and you can learn about and hear from<br>some of our<br>professors and also some of our students<br>that are here and their experiences<br>at waikato thank you for<br>listening and hopefully we've been able<br>to answer some of your questions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
