leader<br>for the bachelor of teaching program<br>so we've got two of our staff here and<br>some students that you'll meet<br>we'll focus first on our teaching<br>programs<br>that cover early childhood primary and<br>secondary<br>so we have the bachelor of education a<br>graduate diploma in teaching<br>postgraduate diploma teaching and a<br>masters of teaching and learning<br>i'm just going to hand over to philippa<br>oh curacao um philip because we've<br>talked<br>i'm the academic coordinator for the<br>bachelor of teaching for the students<br>hamilton students who are here on campus<br>so thanks for being here today you're<br>probably sitting here<br>wondering if teaching is for you so<br>i thought that we would let two of our<br>students tell you about their<br>experiences and why they got into<br>teaching but first of all i'll let you<br>introduce yourselves um so i'm saskia<br>riedel<br>and i am a second year bachelor of<br>teaching<br>my name is tutti um i'm also a second<br>year doing my ba and teaching primary<br>kakanora<br>could you explain for us what kakanova<br>is yeah so kakanoro is the maori<br>stream i'd say going off of the<br>mainstream towards the degree that i sit<br>on<br>yeah it basically covers the maori<br>curriculum<br>taught in the maori schools and<br>bilingual schools as well throughout new<br>zealand<br>okay first question what inspired you to<br>decide to become a teacher<br>um i'll go first yeah um what really<br>inspired me to become a teacher was just<br>the<br>number of um i guess children<br>in new zealand who i wanted<br>to influence i guess because children<br>are going to be their future<br>and they are going to be our leaders and<br>doctors and lawyers and policemen and<br>police women<br>and they're going to be the front of new<br>zealand in a few years and i wanted to<br>have an influence on that<br>and wanted to kind of be a driving force<br>behind what new zealand will look like<br>in 50 years<br>and so that's why i decided to go into<br>primary teaching<br>uh that's mine is very similar to<br>saskias um<br>personally i grew up with a lot of<br>teachers in my family and a lot of role<br>models towards the education life which<br>i kind of<br>grew to love over time and knowing that<br>how<br>bad my community was and how low of<br>teachers were<br>where i am from i kind of gained this<br>passion towards wanting to become a<br>teacher to go home<br>to basically teach and you know<br>influence others<br>to grow up in this world educated i'd<br>say<br>yeah so you see teaching as a way to<br>so you're both second years what has<br>surprised you the most about<br>teaching<br>oh i think something that surprised me<br>is<br>how hard it actually is not um<br>not so much academically there are<br>points in that which<br>are really hard but also just working<br>with<br>students and going into placement um i<br>thought it would be a lot of fun and<br>games<br>but while it is fun and games there were<br>moments where<br>um that were really hard and i wasn't<br>expecting that<br>um you actually yeah there's a lot of<br>work that goes behind being a teacher<br>and a lot of behind the scenes stuff<br>that<br>i wasn't expecting so much yeah yeah<br>well coming from a kuda kapoor by myself<br>i found a real culture shock<br>coming to this big entire environment<br>and then studying such a<br>i'd say a very interesting degree<br>um but overall it was just<br>the experience i guess of being in<br>second year and first year<br>which kind of gave me a shock towards it<br>um<br>the workload is much bigger than i<br>thought it was going to be<br>what we're trying to sell the program<br>yeah sorry it was it was<br>it's made that you can manage it um and<br>overall it's a really really good good<br>program to be on<br>um it's real culturally supportive as<br>well<br>come from my perspective saskia you<br>mentioned<br>being in your school can you just tell<br>us a little bit about that um<br>yeah so for the first year so last year<br>we were in<br>school one day a week which was on a<br>thursday<br>and then at the end of our academic year<br>we got to go into school for<br>it was three weeks um which was<br>really amazing it was a really awesome<br>opportunity to be able to go<br>into a placement so early on in the<br>course<br>because you really got to see if you<br>enjoy teaching and if you actually liked<br>being around<br>children all day and whether it was<br>something you could see yourself doing<br>and also just getting that experience of<br>being in the classroom was really<br>awesome<br>um and the three-week block was amazing<br>so one and a half years in what would<br>you say are the most rewarding parts of<br>being a teacher<br>definitely the experience overall the<br>experience<br>learning what my teachers actually went<br>through to teach me<br>i have much appreciation for them now<br>i hope my future students say the same<br>thing<br>but yeah halfway through the degree i'm<br>really proud of myself and everyone<br>who's started this degree with me um<br>we've been faced with a lot of<br>challenges but overall<br>the entire experience has just been<br>something that i could never express<br>but yeah so you felt a real community<br>feeling yeah<br>um something i found most rewarding<br>would link<br>also back to the placement um and<br>being in the classroom with the students<br>and then working with them and then they<br>just have these light bulb moments of<br>what you've been trying to get through<br>to them and then all of a sudden it<br>clicks and they're like i understand and<br>i get it<br>um and being the teacher of that student<br>i think<br>there's something behind that where you<br>just feel like you're floating on cloud9<br>it's amazing and<br>that's definitely been something that<br>i've really really enjoyed about<br>the placements and just studying to be a<br>teacher<br>yeah great i think you've answered the<br>last question around what are the parts<br>of the program you enjoy the most<br>yeah any last comment join our program<br>yeah i promise you'll be amazing<br>we approve this message thank you<br>now if you already have a degree then we<br>still have programs for you with the<br>graduate teaching<br>um the graduate diploma in teaching and<br>the postgraduate diploma in teaching<br>and there's also the masters of teaching<br>and learning at this point i'd just like<br>to say a huge thank you to both of you<br>for<br>coming in i really appreciate it and<br>we're now going to pass over<br>to diane and adila<br>who are going to share some information<br>sciences<br>kia ora i'm diane forbes and we're here<br>to talk to you about the bachelor of<br>social sciences this is a dealer<br>the bachelor of social sciences is like<br>a degree that you do<br>about learning in education quite<br>broadly<br>when you may not actually want to be a<br>teacher in an<br>early childhood centre or in a classroom<br>particularly<br>because learning and education are<br>something that goes across the life span<br>and through a range of contexts in the<br>community<br>and for various ages so if you're<br>interested in learning<br>throughout life not sure that you want<br>to be a teacher in a classroom then you<br>might consider<br>the bachelor of social sciences as a<br>degree<br>the bachelor of social sciences has<br>three majors named on the<br>slide there and it's quite a good<br>complement<br>to other degrees that are offered here<br>at the university of waikato<br>including the bachelor of laws and some<br>people<br>will do a conjoint degree a double<br>degree<br>or will take some of our majors as minor<br>subjects in conjunction with other<br>studies as well<br>just looking at our majors there<br>education and society<br>which is offered in hamilton and in<br>tauranga at the beautiful campus over<br>there<br>that's about lifelong learning as we<br>said<br>but about the social cultural political<br>influences that that um on<br>learning and lifelong learning um the<br>second major there<br>is not that they're in any particular<br>order is digital learning<br>um which is one that i work in in<br>particular<br>and that's about how digital<br>technologies can influence<br>and affect um both enhance and hinder<br>learning throughout the life span as<br>well<br>so if you're interested in how learning<br>might occur through<br>apps through digital games and through<br>social media<br>then digital learning might be a major<br>or a minor that you would look at<br>as a subject in the bee soccer and<br>finally on the slide there we have human<br>development<br>human development is about learning<br>across the entire human<br>lifespan from even before birth<br>right through to the inevitable end<br>so we look at in human development<br>development<br>and learning throughout the whole of<br>life<br>while you can do a bachelor of social<br>sciences majoring in education and<br>society<br>digital learning or human development<br>through our school of education<br>there are other varieties of the bee<br>soccer degree that are offered by the<br>faculty of arts<br>in social sciences and also by the<br>faculty of<br>maori and indigenous studies too here at<br>the<br>university of waikato if you google be<br>soccer waikato you see a really<br>informative<br>website about the degree in its<br>varieties<br>and to see the education varieties with<br>those three majors<br>you can just click on the education tab<br>why would you do a bee soccer in<br>education<br>probably because you're interested in<br>looking very widely<br>at how learning occurs and what<br>influences learning<br>throughout the entire lifespan at all<br>ages<br>and stages you might be interested in<br>becoming a community educator<br>or a trainer you might be interested in<br>becoming a policy advisor<br>or a youth worker or maybe you'd like to<br>have a go at designing educational<br>software<br>and games and apps that are supportive<br>of learning<br>and i'd like to turn you over to adela<br>who is one of our bachelor of social<br>sciences students<br>hi everyone um okay got some questions<br>for a dealer here<br>so tell the people what you're studying<br>i'm studying a bachelor of social<br>sciences<br>majoring in human development<br>human development so what's human<br>development like for you<br>um it's actually really interesting<br>because<br>you learn the biological concepts as<br>well as the psychological<br>concepts in a human being and<br>um you study different age groups<br>so from adolescents from like tweens<br>teens or like adolescents and adulthood<br>or aging and um you just learn<br>their how they change in their behaviors<br>and attitudes towards people<br>and yes understanding humans<br>yeah a bit of biology and psychology in<br>there as well as social influences on<br>understanding humans it sounds great<br>why did you choose uh be society with<br>education<br>um well i at first i didn't want to<br>i was planning on doing teaching but<br>then<br>i found this degree<br>um when i was doing summer school and um<br>when i<br>read about it there's just so many more<br>opportunities<br>available when you do this degree so if<br>you don't want to do<br>and if you don't necessarily want to<br>teach you can actually do this degree<br>but<br>still be involved in the education field<br>and i guess you can change your mind<br>again later too because if you do want<br>to teach you have the graduate pathways<br>that wendy was talking about before<br>so what do you enjoy most about your<br>studies um<br>with this degree i actually study and i<br>enjoy studying different papers<br>so since last year my first year now<br>i've studied<br>i've done psychology papers i've done<br>education papers<br>human development papers and philosophy<br>papers as well<br>so there's like a range of opportunities<br>a lot of papers that you can do with<br>this degree it's kind of flexible<br>yeah a huge variety of years so what are<br>your plans for the future<br>um since this is my second year<br>hopefully next year i'll graduate and<br>i'm planning on doing a graduate diploma<br>in teaching<br>fantastic yeah which takes us full<br>circle<br>we just wanted to mention that after<br>your undergraduate studies<br>there are a range of options for<br>continuing through graduate postgraduate<br>education programs at masters level<br>some of those are mentioned on the<br>slides there so you can study various<br>flavors of masters<br>in education educational leadership<br>and a master of educational management<br>is also available<br>as well as a closer look at disability<br>and inclusion studies<br>and the master of counselling so that's<br>truly lifelong learning<br>exemplified there because you can keep<br>going and study<br>and develop your life long learn<br>learning even further<br>foreign</p></main><footer
