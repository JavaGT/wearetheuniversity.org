astronomically<br>based celebration that has now<br>become part of wider new zealand<br>identity<br>and so to be able to be part of that<br>movement<br>really drives me to continue to work in<br>the space and also just seeing the<br>lights come on<br>at times you know when you i suppose any<br>teacher as a lecturer at university<br>as a teacher in my you know my own space<br>when you see the lights come on for<br>people and they just there's that moment<br>where you can<br>see that they are really<br>the penny drops for them are so<br>rewarding it's such<br>um my name is nao smith and i'm a<br>kaimahi here in the faculty of mighty<br>and indigenous studies and i'm just<br>going to give you a quick<br>rundown on the session today so we're<br>going to start off with me giving you a<br>few pointers on why you should study<br>with waikato university and in<br>particular the faculty of mighty and<br>indigenous studies<br>then i'm going to hand you off to marika<br>who's going to cover some of our<br>subjects<br>and finally we'll wrap our session up<br>with a student panel<br>who will be able to answer any part-time<br>you may have about being a student<br>within the faculty of mighty and<br>indigenous studies and we're<br>also lucky enough to have the lovely<br>tamahata here who's a lecturer<br>within the faculty so if you've got any<br>course related uh questions you'll be<br>able to ask those pathway directly<br>to him remember we've got the live chat<br>running so feel free to send any<br>questions our way and we'll do our best<br>to answer them on the go sorry let's<br>kick start things uh<br>why why cuddle why study with the<br>faculty of maori and indigenous studies<br>well there's two reasons mainly that i<br>can think of firstly<br>we are a maori university we're the<br>modern university<br>in new zealand and that's not just<br>because of our name<br>but because of the whenua that we're<br>located on and gives us a really<br>unique and special relationship with the<br>kingitanga now if you walk around our<br>campus<br>you'll get a special feel that cultural<br>feel because maori culture is embedded<br>in everything that we do here at waikato<br>the faces you see one in four students<br>are maori students<br>so straight off the bat you feel a part<br>of the culture you feel part of the<br>environment<br>and you might wonder so what who cares<br>what's that going to do with anything<br>well we're coming from a research-based<br>perspective and research tells us that<br>indigenous students<br>perform best in indigenous spaces<br>waikato university<br>and in particular the faculty of maori<br>and indigenous studies is just that<br>it's an indigenous space where you're<br>taught by people that look like you<br>that have the same fakado as you and all<br>the support services<br>are set up to ensure that you can<br>achieve your best with the faculty of<br>maori and indigenous studies<br>the second reason that you should study<br>with us well<br>it comes down to our teaching staff<br>you're learning from the best and i<br>don't just mean that in a new zealand<br>context i mean that in an international<br>context<br>we have the likes of professor linda two<br>he wei smith now she is the most<br>referenced<br>indigenous scholar in the world we have<br>who you just saw on screen professor<br>rangi matamua<br>who is the first maori to ever win a<br>prime minister's science award<br>not just that he almost single-handedly<br>revitalized maori astronomy<br>we've got the likes of dr te kaho to<br>mike maxwell<br>he's the advisory to the king he's a te<br>matatini expert<br>dr hakitopaki who has won so many<br>research grants<br>for revitalizing pacific navigation and<br>of course we cannot forget<br>the legendary professor poe timura he's<br>you know he was one of the co-founders<br>of te pana kiritanga<br>he is a te reo exponent an award-winning<br>one<br>and on top of all that you get to learn<br>from a practicing touhou<br>they can't get much better than that<br>guys so if you're interested in learning<br>in the indigenous study space<br>those are just a few reasons why you<br>should do it with us here at waikato<br>university<br>within the faculty of maori and<br>indigenous studies i'm going to pass<br>over to marek marika<br>is going to quickly go through some of<br>our subjects and then from there we'll<br>hit the panel<br>so we have three subjects or three<br>majors so we have te reo maori<br>marion indigenous studies and pacific<br>and indigenous studies<br>so um pacific and indigenous studies<br>focuses on the diverse pacific region<br>as well as looks at experiences<br>perspectives and history of pacific<br>people within<br>aotearoa and then maori and indigenous<br>focuses on or educates us on relevant<br>topics of today so<br>colonization treaty principles mana<br>motsuhake and tikanga and many more<br>things as well<br>and both of these subjects so pacific<br>and<br>maori have indigenous studies right next<br>to them is<br>we um sorry i'm just looking at some<br>notes um both uh<br>with these studies because it allows or<br>brings in international perspectives and<br>relevance into our subjects<br>and last but not least we have te reo<br>maori as one of our majors<br>or subjects if you are passionate about<br>survival<br>revitalization and retention of te reo<br>maori no my haramai ki konai<br>um we'll support you in however we can<br>but that's just a brief overview of all<br>our majors or subjects within<br>the faculty of maori and indigenous<br>studies but now i'm going to hand it<br>over to our taiwa<br>if you have any more apartheid just<br>tippity tap tap tap<br>on your keyboards um and we'll try to<br>answer them as best we can so hand it<br>over<br>foreign<br>foreign<br>oh<br>okay so we've had a question come<br>through from sarah from northland<br>uh she wants to

know<br>okay what's been your favorite thing<br>about studying in the faculty of maori<br>and indigenous studies<br>learning from stalwarts of tower maori<br>it's been like just you just i'm so<br>honored to be able to<br>learn from them and just so grateful<br>that i can learn from them that's been<br>the best for me<br>you can't find any better level of<br>mataranga maori<br>other than here at tifari or waikato um<br>i think our faculty tapu kital speaks<br>for itself<br>um it has its own name not nationally<br>but internationally as we've<br>mentioned and also as haryata mentioned<br>all the um<br>experts that uh work for the pool<br>waianae<br>if you had to pick one lecture who would<br>they're all equally amazing yeah she's<br>lying<br>she's not a favorite she's just scary<br>now definitely papa paul to your mother<br>i mean he's a<br>hunger um he's a expert exponent<br>um help create te pani kiritanga<br>and if i didn't say his name would<br>probably put him on me yeah<br>also he's pretty skunkster lux he just<br>wants to look after you<br>so um yeah mine would be papa as well<br>and definitely not running<br>no no he's a man too okay i've just got<br>a question from telly marsh<br>what do you think is the best hall to go<br>brian hall absolutely okay so we've got<br>some bright<br>um you can you know you'll start from<br>100 level and that's where you get<br>all that base knowledge for learning<br>real and it doesn't matter where you're<br>at<br>yeah and you'll find throughout all<br>levels of the papers that you have<br>different levels of<br>fluency papers and it's not a bad thing<br>to have<br>um no known knowledge of tedious or a<br>little um amount of knowledge<br>you'll be uh menarched by your fellow<br>classmates i reckon so<br>there are two streams we have our<br>mainstream<br>course papers and then<br>our umaki full immersion paper<br>in the past there were two two streams<br>under the<br>and that was which we had<br>beginners basic beginner and then<br>intermediate to advanced and the other<br>string but now<br>uh for a few years now it's<br>the two point they has become one so you<br>start from<br>level one and we have a mix of<br>students from uh that have the words the<br>basic kupu<br>as far as kia ora ten and then you have<br>advanced students so we get a lot of<br>advance<br>elders i think that we had in the last<br>intake was about<br>70 78 maybe<br>and then our youngest being 17 so it is<br>a mix<br>of a wide mix<br>of levels ages<br>and we get on real well<br>um but as you as you find um<br>yourself into the poitai uh<br>they are they are the the<br>you have you have your ups and downs um<br>and your challenges but in terms of<br>um registering to<br>tutor yeah there's no<br>limit really you can come in with your<br>advanced feel<br>or very basic and um we're happy to take<br>you in<br>um but there is we do have standards and<br>majority of the papers aren't until<br>maori you don't need to be fluent until<br>you don't like that<br>you'll get there though your real is<br>are around you and they're whispering<br>real in your ears so<br>just listen i think uh i think our level<br>one to level two papers<br>um our our lectures our<br>teaching staff um we hold a<br>uh level within those papers and that's<br>yes to cross between both languages uh<br>maori<br>and pakeha and we kind of<br>help you along and nurture you<br>but when we get to the top end of level<br>two<br>um in level three uh you need to be<br>prepared to<br>hear a lot of te reo maori being spoken<br>amongst<br>your peers as well as the teachers and<br>and you can get lost<br>at times but we're also there to support<br>you but<br>you are here at the waikato<br>to um to obviously to<br>to advance and get to some point we<br>can't stick<br>and um both languages from level one to<br>level three<br>there's the time where we need to have<br>full real maori classes so that's the<br>tyrion<br>subject or major what about the malian<br>indigenous studies josh is<br>um well my indigenous studies sits<br>alongside um tedio maori as a major<br>and so you can see there's quite a lot<br>of crossovers between the two classes<br>you'll find that<br>um with maori indigenous studies the<br>papers and<br>um uh fully taught interior but you'll<br>be interacting with a lot of um concepts<br>a lot of maori<br>concepts which yeah you'll be able to<br>pick up along the way<br>i feel like um for me personally um i<br>came from a<br>mainstream school where i had little to<br>no interaction with te reo maori or<br>or kopapo maori and now that in my<br>second year at<br>tifariwan or waikato doing te reo maori<br>i can hold a pretty good conversation<br>yeah<br>it's also in tikanga<br>our papers we have a stream of tikanga<br>kapahaka from level 1 level one level<br>two level three capacitor papers<br>um what's cool about that paper is<br>it is toronto uh in english<br>uh but as um<br>yeah we we talk on real maori<br>content in topics and key um<br>origin code about the atua in it but<br>it's<br>via te reo parque um<br>and the reason is because<br>we have international students uh last<br>year i had<br>i think 16 students in<br>um level one kapaka so<br>yeah i can't kind of leave them in the<br>lich but our<br>advanced speakers yep you can do your<br>assessments interior maori you can do<br>them in both languages<br>um and i think in the other papers<br>poetry<br>what are some other papers um<br>the real three hundred paper with mata<br>the slam poetry<br>yes that's actually in english but you<br>can do<br>um but yeah so they are always going to<br>cross cross over with<br>one another because you can't have one<br>without the other<br>i think that's something that you need<br>to be spoken to<br>i think that's just the beauty of our<br>faculty that we're able to work<br>um and stand tall in both worlds and be<br>able to educate<br>yeah um another question we've got<br>from monique would you recommend going<br>yeah so it's definitely a great way to<br>be immersed that's another way you can<br>be immersed with interior<br>and chikanga and hitori and many other<br>aspects of kaipapa maori<br>um it's a way that you can also find to<br>support one another<br>on your journeys through mata rana maori<br>as a whole yeah so i definitely<br>recommend kappa maori forms<br>bryant hall brian what's um<br>with another question team what's the<br>best part about<br>um i think everybody builds up to the<br>um and can't wait to to<br>go on the end of um yeah trip<br>but um uh<br>i've been involved uh teaching te tua<br>poite now for about two and a half years<br>and um for me as a kayaku<br>i witness i get to see<br>the our students climb<br>levels i guess in and really seeing them<br>um evolve from or developing<br>in their journey is special to me<br>because<br>and then going on um yeah<br>having like real parkour real maori kind<br>of<br>presentations and then being able to<br>speak uh fully into<br>maori is quite special and um<br>the emotional journey that you go<br>through<br>the ups and downs yeah um<br>but it's not only real like um<br>they've touched on tikanga being a big<br>part so<br>yes there is wayata yes there's karakia<br>there's<br>um the whole chicago inspectors as well<br>so if you are looking for a program that<br>um you want to learn today maori<br>within a short period of time it's from<br>nine to three o'clock<br>monday to friday um that's<br>you one of the only programs that allows<br>we've got to wrap it up now but there's<br>been a couple of questions that have<br>come through that unfortunately we<br>haven't had time to answer i will make<br>sure to answer those personally on the<br>chat lines keep those questions coming<br>through<br>um on our panel today um<br>yeah thanks very much and as i say keep<br>those questions<br>to answer them<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
