world of business<br>education<br>um we're internationally benchmark in<br>the top of one percent of all business<br>schools<br>uh that's because we have something<br>called a triple crown<br>so triple crown accreditation means that<br>we're accredited by three international<br>business<br>uh accreditation agencies that's not<br>going to mean a heck of a lot to you<br>but it means a lot to us and it means a<br>lot to in terms of the staff that we<br>recruit<br>and the other universities and<br>organizations that we're able to partner<br>with<br>and all of our partners are all of your<br>partners as students and<br>i know at the moment we're not flying<br>everywhere around the world but<br>soon we will be again and we have many<br>international partners who also have<br>that triple crown<br>we're ranked first in new zealand for<br>economics research<br>um we are ranked in the top<br>300 for all of our subjects um<br>that's in the world and remembering<br>there's thousands of universities in the<br>world<br>um we recognise our accountancy<br>qualifications are recognized by all<br>those<br>accrediting agencies we have the only<br>four four-year management degree<br>in new zealand which we're very proud of<br>the bms honours i'll talk to you about<br>that<br>in a few more slides and our research<br>strengths<br>um that we say are our sort of flagships<br>are responsible and sustainable<br>management leading through innovation<br>as a student our interest is in helping<br>you to prepare for your future<br>and that's through a combination of<br>we're very proud of the practical<br>learning that we deliver<br>and almost and well in all of the majors<br>that we offer there's a practical<br>component<br>um and for example we have some pretty<br>awesome simulation<br>going on in the finance trading lab um<br>in<br>our marketing major you do a marketing<br>trade show which is a<br>is pretty much like the real deal with<br>real products and<br>um and showing you showing uh as a team<br>what you can produce<br>um and in all of our<br>subjects you're dealing with real life<br>business issues<br>and solving some pretty gnarly problems<br>that have come to us through industry<br>internships are a part of every<br>undergraduate degree we offer<br>and that provides experience with<br>industry and sometimes for a lot of<br>students that's a foot in the door for<br>employment post<br>study with us lots of opportunity<br>working groups<br>international exchange opportunities<br>both um as i say<br>at some point going overseas but also<br>and students coming here<br>we run careers workshops to help people<br>prepare for when they are looking for<br>jobs<br>cvs and all that sort of stuff<br>leadership's something we're very<br>passionate about<br>we've got some of the best professors<br>and leadership on staff at university of<br>waikato and we<br>run all sorts of lots of opportunities<br>for leadership<br>for our students and we run a variety of<br>networking events<br>with employers to hopefully open the<br>door<br>in terms of undergraduate study at<br>wakanda management school we've got<br>three undergraduate degrees i'm going to<br>talk about the first two<br>which is the bachelor of business um<br>which three degree available in hamilton<br>and tauranga<br>the bachelor of management studies with<br>honours which i mentioned our four-year<br>degree which is available<br>in hamilton and the battery<br>communication which i'm going to leave<br>for my colleague stuart dillon is going<br>to talk to you<br>anyone else here about that in the next<br>session and we've got some really<br>exciting stuff happening in that<br>qualification<br>but i guess i won't steal his thunder<br>i'll leave that for then<br>in terms of the bachelor of business um<br>as mentioned<br>it can be taken in hamilton and tauranga<br>you'll see on this slide<br>we've highlighted the the major subjects<br>that can be taken in tauranga<br>with a tea so accounting strategic<br>management marketing and finance are all<br>available<br>in hamilton and tauranga the others are<br>available<br>uh on our hamilton campus<br>and uh so with those ten major subjects<br>we also have minor subjects which means<br>you can um<br>take about four papers um to complement<br>a major in another subject<br>we have agribusiness uh leadership<br>communication<br>international management and project<br>management uh fun fact i'm currently<br>doing some of our project management<br>papers because i decided i should do<br>some more study<br>um ask me later whether that was a good<br>idea um but i am really enjoying it it's<br>a new program and it's and i'm really<br>enjoying<br>the the courses um there's some career<br>opportunities there in the bubble<br>um you'll um recognize all those sorts<br>of um<br>occupations i guess um but pretty much<br>the<br>um it just opens up a whole world of<br>opportunities<br>having an undergraduate business degree<br>under your belt um lots of things<br>are possible from there whether it's<br>running your own business or<br>or um being part of a big multinational<br>company<br>i'll show you a little bit about the<br>structure of the bachelor of business<br>um uh yellow black and red you'll<br>recognize the waikato colours<br>so the yellow boxes there um on the left<br>show<br>the papers uh that you'd take for a<br>major subject so those<br>are the you know accounting marketing<br>digital business finance etc<br>um the black boxes are other papers<br>within my kinder management school<br>and the read boxes on the right there<br>you can take<br>another major you can take another major<br>from management subjects<br>or in fact you can take another major<br>from any sub any subject offered by the<br>university<br>it could be law could be a language uh<br>do<br>tadeo uh you could do politics<br>anything can go in those read boxes they<br>don't have to be from wacom management<br>school<br>and as i say you could do a double major<br>in accounting<br>and strategic management or you can fill<br>it up with<br>anything you want at the right levels in<br>your first year though which is what<br>you'll be wondering about<br>um you pretty much there's a list there<br>of business fundamental papers<br>you have to do five of those papers um<br>and depending on what you're majoring in<br>will<br>obviously dictate to some extent which<br>which um<br>of the papers you do um you can do all<br>six<br>and then that would if you did all six<br>that would fill up your yellow and black<br>boxes and then you could choose anything<br>you wanted for the two red boxes<br>but you don't need to memorize all of<br>that if you<br>are at the point that you are interested<br>in studying with us someone can<br>um work through you with you<br>what you need to select i'm just going<br>to move on now to the bachelor of<br>management studies with honours<br>um so you'll see a couple of cameo<br>shots come up of different people who<br>are alumni of these programs<br>um jan zeiteveld is the ceo of avon<br>international and he did a bms<br>degree with us a few years ago and<br>continues to work with us as part of our<br>global leadership program<br>so the bachelor management studies with<br>honours<br>i mentioned that um it's only available<br>in hamilton in actual fact the first<br>two years of it if you're doing those<br>four majors i mentioned can be done<br>over in tauranga but currently for years<br>three and four you'd need to come<br>across to hamilton uh so the structure<br>uh is deliberately set so that the first<br>two years of the bachelor of business<br>and the first two years of the bms<br>honors are exactly the same<br>so you've got a number of points at<br>which you can make the decision whether<br>to move on<br>to the four-year degree or exit with a<br>three-year degree<br>i know when you're starting a degree<br>four year seems like a long time so you<br>might not feel you're ready to commit to<br>that<br>but as i say at the end of year one well<br>end of any semester up until uh year<br>three you can choose to come across<br>um so and the difference with the<br>veteran management studies with honours<br>in years three and four<br>uh we take you through a uh some<br>i guess how would we call you our<br>transferable skills leadership skills<br>um we talked a lot to industry when we<br>reshaped the bachelor of management<br>studies with honours to find out what<br>sort of things<br>they are looking for in in graduates um<br>and so you'll see in the top oh sorry<br>bottom two rows and the yellow<br>um some names of papers these are the<br>ones that are specific to the bachelor<br>management studies with honours so<br>things like managing people and projects<br>negotiating<br>and communicating effectively data<br>informed decision making<br>business ethics and managing risk<br>leading for an uncertain future<br>understanding global business practice<br>managing strategically<br>and notably and the veteran management<br>studies with honours you actually do two<br>work based um placement papers<br>so you do the one that's at 300 level<br>which is in all of our degrees and then<br>you also do the 500 level one<br>i should have mentioned when i was<br>talking about the bachelor of business<br>but it's it's the same in the bms<br>honours that the other compulsory papers<br>we have is the<br>econs 205 you'll see there at second<br>year which is a data analytics with<br>business<br>applications paper again this is<br>something that employers are saying<br>they're really looking for in graduates<br>and an intercultural perspectives on<br>organisations paper<br>uh again um giving people that breadth<br>of um<br>wisdom around what it means to be part<br>of a part of a nation part of a<br>country part of a global community and<br>um that also flows through to that um<br>paper in the final year global business<br>practice where i<br>at some point we're hoping that we'll be<br>able to take students on<br>what we're not just hoping we know we'll<br>be able to take students on<br>international study tours as part of<br>that um but equally there's plenty of<br>multinational businesses<br>in new zealand um who can show us what<br>it means to<br>operate globally so that's part of<br>what's special about that bms on us<br>we're only we reshaped this a couple of<br>years ago the bms honors is<br>our oldest qualification uh and it's<br>got a lot of really really successful uh<br>alumni<br>uh and graduates uh coming through<br>and next year will be the first cohort<br>that move into this new three-year third<br>year of the program so<br>we're really excited about it i think<br>they're really excited about it and<br>i know that people value the graduates<br>that come out of this program<br>i'll just move on to talk a little bit<br>about what we offer at the graduate and<br>postgraduate<br>level so this will be relevant even if<br>you're not yet<br>starting any study you might want to<br>think about you know what what can i do<br>after that or<br>perhaps you've joined us today and you<br>already have some qualifications or<br>significant work experience and<br>looking at a career change that top one<br>there that's my<br>that's the thing i'm doing graduate<br>certificate in project management i<br>think it's going to take me more than<br>four months but don't worry about that<br>um my problem uh i could and with all<br>these things for that i'm doing it one<br>paper at a time<br>and um with a lot of these programs that<br>is an option to to just<br>sort of plug away at them you don't have<br>to um do it all flat out from<br>from the get-go uh so that's a very new<br>qualification which<br>anyone any graduate can go into and um<br>gives you experience in project<br>management project leadership<br>and has been very popular already it's<br>available fully online<br>so that's also something that's popular<br>about it the master of applied finance<br>um and if you skip to over that to the<br>master of professional accounting<br>these are both sort of career change um<br>qualifications<br>so you with the master applied finance<br>or professional accounting you don't<br>have to have done those subjects before<br>in fact<br>you wouldn't do these qualifications if<br>you've done those subjects before<br>these take people who again got an<br>undergraduate degree in another subject<br>or really significant work experience<br>and<br>and gives you the knowledge you need to<br>practice in those fields the master<br>professional accounting<br>takes you through to being a<br>professionally qualified accountant uh<br>and the master of applied fairness gives<br>you the all the skills you need to work<br>in the finance sector<br>uh the master of management in the<br>middle there this is again a very new<br>qualification<br>um it is a 180 point qualification that<br>means you can do it over a full calendar<br>year<br>um it's if you're studying full time<br>it's<br>as it as it says there it's designed for<br>graduates from any field<br>and um but and then at the masters level<br>you'll specialize in either marketing<br>or supply chain management it also has<br>some of those general skills that we<br>talked about in the bms honors in terms<br>of<br>um so that the people the strategy<br>and um and planning skills<br>that um that will boost you to be able<br>to work in a management role or<br>leadership role in an organization<br>or marketing and marketing or supply<br>chain people that are<br>taking an interest in this are people<br>who have been working in a particular<br>industry you know it might be<br>the electrical industry or uh<br>construction<br>and have been doing the doing and now<br>wanting to move further up the ladder<br>um and this sort of um prepares them for<br>that for that<br>work also at the graduate and<br>postgraduate level<br>um we have the master of digital<br>business again this is available fully<br>online<br>or face to face and it's another<br>one of these sort of what we call<br>conversion qualifications you have to<br>have a little bit of background<br>in digital and e-commerce but<br>you can pretty much come to it from a<br>wide variety of backgrounds and again<br>it's a very popular qualification<br>the master of business management is a<br>pretty much a full-time one-year program<br>which is a general masters degree<br>again for graduates from any field and<br>then we have the master of business<br>administration the mba which you've<br>probably heard a bit all about those<br>um which people typically do part-time<br>as they're<br>while they're working and it's for<br>people who've got about 10 years work<br>experience<br>so i if you're even if you're only just<br>starting<br>now um or if you're coming to us having<br>uh<br>done some other study or um looking to<br>change up what you're doing<br>there's quite a few options there um and<br>for example<br>you know you could do a three-year<br>bachelor of business and then a one-year<br>master in business management um or a<br>one-year master in marketing<br>um there's there's lots of options and<br>combos and you don't have to decide that<br>on day one is the good news<br>um we have a range of graduate<br>certificates and diplomas and<br>postgraduate civics diplomas and all of<br>our subjects as well<br>uh getting onto the research<br>postgraduate if you're heading up to the<br>that level of study um<br>we have the master of management studies<br>you probably think i've said the same<br>title about 10 times they're all subtly<br>different and the master of management<br>studies is our research<br>master's degree and um as depending on<br>what you're coming in with it either<br>takes you one or one or two years<br>um and it's for us advanced study in the<br>subject that you took at undergraduate<br>level so this is the one that<br>you don't to do the master of management<br>studies in accounting you have to have<br>done an undergraduate degree in<br>accounting<br>and it is available again in all the<br>subjects we offer at undergraduate level<br>um and and would typically end with a<br>a thesis and a research methods paper<br>and a thesis or a dissertation<br>which would prepare people to go on to<br>even higher levels of study if they want<br>to or<br>and an academic career um but as uh<br>also um has all of those sort of high<br>level skills around<br>fancy things like econometrics and and<br>other things i've got nothing<br>uh i i know nothing about because i<br>haven't done one of those<br>um that will really set you apart from<br>um from people in the field the phd<br>so if you want to go on to be called<br>doctor at some point<br>um that's another four years uh after<br>that<br>um and we also have a master of<br>philosophy which is a research qualif uh<br>research degree um which is<br>a bit smaller don't have to write quite<br>so many words<br>uh just to touch on the student<br>experience uh which we<br>are very proud of student experience at<br>waikato management school and indeed at<br>the university of waikato<br>we sponsor a number of clubs uh wimsa is<br>the waikato management school<br>student association pimsa is the<br>pacifica student association uh<br>taranganaku is our<br>association for our maori students i<br>don't know<br>about the swan um i think that's an i<br>think that's an image from orientation<br>day that's not one of our clubs<br>um we uh where it's the wonderful thing<br>about the start of the year is it's uh<br>it's beautiful summer time then and<br>there's always a bit of fun goes on<br>on campus for orientation and indeed at<br>the<br>at the middle of the year when we have<br>orientation we just move a bit of it<br>indoors<br>um we've got some great clubs and a lot<br>of as<br>this is part of the area where we<br>provide opportunities for students to<br>take leadership roles too so these clubs<br>are all<br>although we give them a little bit of<br>money to help along the way and it's all<br>run and lead and<br>organized by our students and it's also<br>the pool from which a lot of our student<br>ambassadors and people who are working<br>for us um are people that are heavily<br>involved in those clubs as well<br>so uh that's a nice image of the front<br>of our building<br>and with some of our wonderful students<br>in fact uh one of those students has<br>even come on<br>now and is working for the university of<br>waikato i won't say which one<br>um but um thank you for joining us<br>and i think that's all from me for now</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
