going to give you a brief<br>overview of the university<br>including things like our scholarship<br>offerings our subject offerings<br>and how you might go about structuring<br>your degree so<br>i'm going to begin with a video that<br>shows off our beautiful campus<br>enjoy this<br>is the university of waikato where every<br>day<br>people are making a positive change<br>where research helps tackle global<br>challenges<br>and elite athletes can compete at the<br>top of their game<br>a place where people are given the tools<br>to protect their whenua<br>for future generations where talent is<br>nurtured<br>and excellence is celebrated<br>it's a place where industry innovation<br>and education<br>converge and when moments are shared<br>it's a place where teaching and learning<br>has no borders<br>and people of all races and cultures<br>our people our future positive change<br>wonderful so you're likely familiar with<br>our hamilton campus but we also have a<br>campus over in todonga so if you have an<br>interest in studying by the ocean<br>or indeed about the ocean then you might<br>like to do so at our tauranga campus<br>so there are a number of reasons why you<br>might choose waikoto university as your<br>university of choice<br>and a lot of these or the ones um<br>showing right now we will incidentally<br>come to throughout the presentation<br>um but when surveying and current and<br>past students<br>overwhelmingly they suggested the reason<br>they chose to study with us<br>was because of our flexible degree<br>structures so it means that these<br>students could study<br>exactly what they wanted to study uh in<br>the ways that they wanted to study it<br>and also time and time again<br>student-made students made reference to<br>our excellent teaching resources and<br>staff<br>as well as our really robust student<br>services so these amongst many others<br>that we will come to<br>are reasons that you might choose to<br>also one of the questions i encounter<br>time and time again is students deciding<br>whether they should<br>take a gap year after school and go and<br>see the rest of the world and go<br>traveling or whether they should come<br>and study<br>so the university has set up our study<br>exchange program which means that you<br>can do both of these things<br>at the same time so what this involves<br>is<br>completing your first year of study with<br>us here on campus and then you can<br>choose to go abroad for your<br>second or indeed part of your third year<br>of study so we have partnership<br>universities across the world<br>and we have student and international<br>advisors who you can liaise with to plan<br>your perfect study trip<br>abroad obviously covered willing<br>so the technical stuff getting into a<br>degree with us<br>more or less nca university entrance<br>will get you<br>entry into most of our degrees noting<br>that there are exceptions with things<br>like engineering which require you to<br>have some quite specific<br>math entry requirements as well as law<br>requires you to have some specific<br>literacy entry requirements or<br>a merit endorsement at level two but<br>otherwise<br>more or less university entrance will<br>get you into<br>um most of our degrees so just so we're<br>all clear<br>university entrance is your numeracy<br>credits at level one<br>your literacy credits at level two and<br>then this year given<br>um the covert circumstances it is 12<br>credits and three university approved<br>subjects<br>at level three so usually 14 credits but<br>um that allowance has been lowered a<br>little bit this year<br>and so if you were to get those three<br>things then you would be on your merry<br>so this is the really um excellent and<br>exciting fun part of<br>thinking about studying with us and<br>that's planning your degree<br>so the degree is is structured more or<br>less in this way<br>where you have your three years of study<br>again there are exceptions like<br>engineering or life law<br>but generally you would enroll in a<br>three-year bachelor's degree<br>um and that would be structured in such<br>a way where you have your<br>major subject your papers that relate to<br>the degree that you've enrolled in so<br>these are the white boxes that you can<br>see in the middle of the screen<br>and then at the end you have elective<br>papers that you can choose to do what<br>you like with<br>so in this case or in this example<br>rather this person has chosen to<br>incorporate a minor so that means these<br>four black boxes are all done in one<br>subject<br>say english for example and that would<br>give the student a minor in english<br>and then the remaining gray boxes can be<br>electives<br>or papers to be done in whatever field<br>the student fancies<br>so just to reiterate the yellow boxes<br>relate to<br>your primary major or the thing that you<br>are going to study most intensely so say<br>that this were to be a bachelor of arts<br>degree then these yellow boxes might be<br>psychology because this person has<br>chosen psychology as their major<br>in which case you would do a collection<br>of compulsory psychology papers<br>and then a collection of papers that<br>relate to the bachelor of arts<br>or bachelor of science if that was the<br>overarching qualification you chose to<br>do<br>or a bachelor of social science and so<br>on and then<br>like i said the gray black boxes at the<br>end can function as your elective papers<br>or your minor but say it was the case<br>that you wanted to specialize in two<br>quite distinct subjects<br>so in this case this example we're going<br>with psychology with an english minor<br>say you enrolled in these english papers<br>and you<br>were really quite fond of english and<br>you wanted to continue studying this<br>you may very well choose to do a double<br>major<br>in which case all of those elective<br>papers would then be committed to the<br>english subject<br>and you would end up with a major in<br>english so i hope that this is making<br>sense<br>usually it helps to be able to see your<br>reactions and to see you nodding but i'm<br>going to<br>assume that that's the case um yeah<br>so yellow boxes relate to your first<br>major or your kind of primary<br>um focus your primary interest the white<br>boxes in the middle relate to compulsory<br>papers<br>for your degree whether that's a science<br>degree or an<br>arts degree or a social science degree<br>or a<br>health sport human performance degree<br>and then<br>the elective or minor or major subjects<br>speaking of subjects this is a fairly<br>comprehensive list<br>of the subjects that we have on offer at<br>this university<br>um you'll note that<br>there might be some some terms that<br>you're unfamiliar with and so it really<br>pays i think<br>to jump online to the waikato university<br>website and<br>look at our paper offerings and then if<br>any subjects are unfamiliar to you or<br>don't quite make sense<br>you can read about what they are what<br>career opportunities they might provide<br>and the list goes on<br>cool so all of those subjects that were<br>listed on the the previous couple of<br>pages<br>in one way or another fit into a degree<br>so the degree is the overarching<br>qualification that you're going to<br>enroll in<br>whether it's a bachelor of business<br>because you want to become an accountant<br>or a bachelor of laws because you want<br>to become a lawyer<br>and so on or a bachelor of music because<br>you have a real passion and want to<br>become a musician whatever the case may<br>be<br>you would fit those subject areas of<br>interest<br>into a degree and like i mentioned<br>earlier you can take two quite distinct<br>subjects so<br>subjects from different fields i gave<br>the example of psychology and english<br>any given degree more or less so the<br>thing to keep in mind is that your<br>primary focus or your first major<br>relates<br>to the degree that you're enrolled in so<br>again if that was psychology then you<br>would enroll in<br>for example a bachelor of social<br>sciences however the second major<br>or the elective papers or the minor and<br>can come from whatever field it doesn't<br>necessarily have to<br>um relate or be offered within the field<br>of your degree<br>i know that this is quite um an<br>overwhelming lot of information to begin<br>with and perhaps a little bit confusing<br>but it should function as just a<br>starting point to to get thinking<br>firstly about what subjects we actually<br>do offer and secondly about how they<br>might work into a degree<br>and then me and my team are always<br>available<br>if you were to just email info at<br>waikato and we could give you um<br>a bit of a firmer sense of how your<br>interests and your passions would<br>translate into a degree<br>and what papers you would ultimately end<br>up doing<br>so once you've found your degree and<br>you've decided to come and study with us<br>you've packed up and came to campus<br>it's really excellent to know what<br>support services are available to you<br>whilst you're here<br>and we really make a real really strong<br>point of emphasizing that you use these<br>support services whilst you're on campus<br>because there's a whole cohort of people<br>and whose job is to look after you and<br>to make sure that you're thriving at<br>university so<br>such people involve the career services<br>team so they can sit down with you<br>practice your cv writing skills your<br>interviewing skills and help you to get<br>a job<br>there's health and well-being on campus<br>so this is things like doctors nurses<br>counselors<br>physios and yeah all of the really<br>robust<br>health service that you can access as a<br>student here on campus<br>we also have the student learning team<br>so they're really excellent if you need<br>any additional academic support<br>you can take your your essays to them<br>you can sit down with someone<br>and talk about the ways in which you<br>might approve improve academically<br>we also have the waikato students union<br>so they advocate for students they run<br>our student<br>magazine and we have the accessibility<br>services<br>so if it was the case that you needed a<br>little bit of additional support with<br>your study whether that's um<br>things like a reader writer or a note<br>taker you can certainly access those<br>services on campus<br>we also have the employability plus<br>program on campus<br>so this is an initiative that allows our<br>students to get some practical knowledge<br>and some experience within the field<br>before they graduate so before they go<br>off into the big wide world<br>and so the employability process program<br>allows you to do some volunteering or<br>internships<br>and there's someone who works with you<br>specifically to coordinate this<br>volunteering<br>and then you're able to put that on your<br>cv and show that you have some<br>experiential knowledge of the field that<br>you're going to go into when you<br>graduate<br>and halls of residence so chances are if<br>you are not a hamiltonian or if you are<br>not living<br>in the waikato already that you will be<br>looking at our halls of residence<br>we have three primary halls of residence<br>that our undergraduate students tend to<br>go into<br>one of which is college hall bryant hall<br>and student village<br>you'll see that there's a slight<br>variance in price between college hall<br>and and the other two halls and that's<br>just because this one has been recently<br>refurbished so it's very sparkly<br>um in comparison to brian hall and<br>student village which are yet to be<br>refurbished<br>but what they lack in kind of recent um<br>refurbishments they make up for in charm<br>so they're all equally lovely places to<br>stay<br>and college hall bryant hall and student<br>village<br>all involve the same things so three hot<br>meals per day your room<br>cleaned and vacuumed which is lovely<br>and wi-fi power everything you need to<br>live on campus is included in that<br>cost again should you<br>should this pick your interest and you<br>would like to further investigate the<br>halls of residence then<br>of course we are welcome you are welcome<br>to come to campus and have someone show<br>you around and give you a halls of<br>the other exciting slide and a really<br>important thing to keep in mind<br>is scholarships so the university offers<br>as you can see a wide range of<br>scholarships and<br>most of which are geared primarily at<br>school leavers<br>so those of you who are leaving school<br>and coming to university at the same<br>time there is a big collection of<br>scholarships that you can apply for<br>uh most importantly there's our<br>courthier tango scholarship which is our<br>general school leaver scholarship and it<br>has a value of up to five thousand<br>dollars<br>and then to be eligible for that you<br>just need to have your university<br>entrance<br>and it really helps to have a merit or<br>excellence endorsement<br>and be coming to waikoto to study with<br>us<br>otherwise there is our to paiwai<br>oterangi scholarship which is worth 25<br>000<br>so quite a substantial amount of money<br>and that one is awarded on<br>outstanding academic success likewise<br>also edmund hillary scholarship which<br>again<br>is worth up to 30 000<br>and also quite a lot of money so that is<br>also<br>awarded on outstanding academic<br>achievement but also if you were to<br>excel<br>in a sport performing or cultural art<br>then<br>um you would be eligible to apply for<br>the sue edmund hillary<br>like i said there are a number of<br>scholarships that you could apply for<br>and so the best thing to do is to go<br>onto our website and type in<br>scholarships it will then produce the<br>scholarships finder for you<br>and on the right hand side there will be<br>a panel where you can dictate<br>um the filters so you can say you're a<br>school leaver you're interested in this<br>specific subject you are coming from<br>this<br>region and it will filter through all of<br>the scholarships that are available to<br>you<br>it's really worth noting that those<br>close on the 31st of august<br>and so it is not far away you have a<br>couple of weeks so you really do need to<br>start thinking of getting those<br>applications and<br>particularly forward to pyway or tadangi<br>and sir edmund hillary scholarship<br>and you need to provide either a video<br>of yourself in the case of syrian<br>hillary<br>or quite a substantial personal<br>statement in the case of tapaiwa or<br>so you might want to start thinking<br>about these things now so you can<br>there are also scholarships available in<br>tauranga particularly<br>tauranga first and family scholarship so<br>if you were the first one in your family<br>to be<br>broaching the tertiary scene then there<br>are scholarships available to you<br>again the list of scholarships is fairly<br>comprehensive so<br>the best way to get a sense of what<br>you're eligible for is to go online<br>to go through that filter and indicate<br>who you are and what you're going to<br>study and see what it feeds back to you<br>apply very broadly and you might<br>surprise yourself<br>even if you think you don't necessarily<br>meet all of the eligibility criteria<br>it's still really worth applying just to<br>see<br>there are also a number of divisional<br>scholarships so again this is when you<br>have the opportunity to filter those<br>scholarships and suggest<br>what division or divisions you're<br>thinking of studying within<br>and it will filter through all of the<br>scholarships available to you<br>particularly in law health management<br>computer science<br>and and beyond<br>so if we haven't already my team and i<br>will be<br>coming to your school to do program or<br>course planning visits which means we're<br>able to sit down with you<br>and plan out your perfect course uh your<br>course for next year<br>and we also have careers expos happening<br>around the country which you<br>should make an effort to attend so you<br>can meet with<br>a one of our advisors or either academic<br>staff who are also attending those<br>careers expos<br>and you can get a sense of the<br>university and what it's like to study<br>here we'll also have some current<br>students<br>and student ambassadors there who are<br>able to talk to you about the student<br>experience<br>we also have a community open day again<br>covered willing<br>i don't know how many times i've said<br>that throughout this presentation<br>but if it's the case that we are allowed<br>to have masses<br>on campus then we will have a community<br>open day on the 29th of august<br>where you can come get a feel for the<br>campus see the halls of residence for<br>yourself<br>and just have a fun day with us<br>the scholarship applications like i said<br>are going to close on the 31st of august<br>so it is really important that you<br>submit an application before<br>then and likewise the halls of residence<br>applications are going to close<br>are going to open rather on the 1st of<br>august and they are going to close on<br>the 1st of october<br>so again get those applications in<br>even if it's the case that you're<br>deciding between a couple of<br>universities and you're not<br>quite sure which one you're going to go<br>to it's really excellent to have<br>applications in for things like halls<br>and scholarships because if you<br>ultimately decided to go<br>elsewhere you can always politely<br>decline those um those offers<br>but if it is the case that you do decide<br>to come with us well then you have a<br>scholarship and a hall<br>um place waiting for you hopefully<br>so yes my advice do apply even if you're<br>not<br>totally certain if you were to do so you<br>would get a conditional offer<br>based off of your level 2 results for<br>nca<br>and that offer would be conditional on<br>you completing level 3<br>or getting university entrance when that<br>is confirmed in january the university<br>would then send you an unconditional<br>offer<br>and you can start preparing to come and<br>so this is the end of my presentation it<br>was a very whirlwind one but i hope that<br>it gave you a sense of the university<br>and how you might go about structuring<br>your degree here and what subjects we<br>have on offer<br>and our scholarships and halls so please<br>do get in touch if you have any<br>questions<br>i do believe there is a chat forum and<br>that the likes of me and my team and in<br>fact lots of people around the<br>university will be accessing<br>so please do use that and we look<br>forward to hearing from you<br>too</p></main><footer
