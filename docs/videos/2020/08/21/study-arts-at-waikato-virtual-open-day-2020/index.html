arts or<br>tekuratoi<br>and the school of arts represents the<br>subjects of international languages and<br>cultures so chinese japanese spanish and<br>french<br>english studies linguistics applied and<br>general music screen media studies<br>theater and dance and writing studies my<br>name is gareth shot and i'm the head of<br>school<br>and i'd just like to start by showing a<br>okay so you'll see from the video that<br>we've got a lot of promotional footage<br>which shows a lot of people practicing<br>uh different elements of performing arts<br>and it looks like we're all singing and<br>all dancing in the school of arts and<br>indeed we are and that is important we<br>are sort of we we<br>present elements of performing arts<br>through theater dance and music and<br>students who come here get to be taught<br>by actual practitioners and people who<br>are experts in their fields but there<br>are other dimensions to the school as<br>well that i wanted to talk about today<br>so yes it's really important to<br>acknowledge some of our wonderful<br>practitioners and our professional<br>performers so you will when you come<br>here if you are interested in those<br>areas you will be taught by composers<br>musicians dancers writers and filmmakers<br>and as an institution uh we are a little<br>bit more broader than that as well so as<br>well as that uh we are you will be<br>taught by community leaders renowned<br>researchers and more importantly people<br>who are acknowledged for their practice<br>whether they're researchers teachers or<br>performers and so we have many<br>award-winning winners as well<br>so you'll be taught by people with real<br>practical experience real world<br>experience who had their work<br>acknowledged outside in the real world<br>such as catherine chichi from writing<br>studies for example<br>or you'll be taught by some of our<br>renowned teaching practitioners so<br>only yesterday dr kirsty moffat from<br>english was awarded a sustained<br>excellence in tertiary teaching award<br>for her excellence in recognition of<br>their excellent teaching<br>and obviously it goes without saying<br>coming to a university you will be<br>taught by leading researchers in various<br>fields<br>coming out of that you get a combination<br>of both practical skills as well as<br>academic skills and our students go in a<br>number of different directions so they<br>go into sort of general sort of uh<br>vocational sort of use their<br>transferable skills in vocational<br>settings but some go into sort of quite<br>specific professional settings so here's<br>one of our graduates who is on the end<br>credits of mortal engines as well<br>so we do have a number of practical<br>elements to what we do which some people<br>don't realize as we're a university they<br>think maybe that's a polytechnic degree<br>but we combine theory and research with<br>practice here at the university so we<br>have some wonderful facilities such as<br>the academy of performing arts which i'm<br>talking to you from today and we've got<br>other industry standard facilities such<br>as television studios and other kinds of<br>labs as well that students can work and<br>in order to produce practical work<br>so the school of arts i'm talking to you<br>from a particular school but we teach<br>across many different degrees and that's<br>quite confusing for some people looking<br>from the outside looking from school<br>thinking about what am i going to do at<br>university so degrees cross the number<br>of schools and so we teach into the<br>bachelor of arts mainly bachelor of<br>music obviously because music is part of<br>our program here in the school of arts<br>we also contribute to the bachelor of<br>design through our media design program<br>and we contribute to the bachelor of<br>social science through linguistics and<br>screen and media studies<br>we've also got a very exciting<br>prospect of a new bachelor in<br>communication coming online in 2021 not<br>quite there yet but keep your eye out<br>for that and the school of arts will be<br>contributed to that in two ways through<br>a major immediate production so people<br>who want to execute media production um<br>in terms of audio visual or audio visual<br>and a major in creative media for those<br>who have<br>more of a creative idea and a vision<br>creative vision and i want to think more<br>sort of strategically and creatively<br>about the approach to sort of creative<br>solutions creative problems or even<br>creating um new creative forms of<br>expression as well<br>um there's a picture of a<br>prime minister on the on the slide there<br>she was also a graduate of the bachelor<br>of communication studies so you can see<br>um the good strong communication skills<br>are really important clear communication<br>skills are really important and that's<br>what we do in the bachelor of<br>arts so we offer a number of majors<br>which provide quite transferable<br>knowledge and one of the things that i<br>would really like to get across when<br>you're thinking about your possible<br>subjects coming from school that if<br>you're thinking about or if you're<br>interested in human condition or human<br>psychology or if you're interested in<br>society and culture you don't<br>necessarily have to think the obvious<br>routes such as going into politics or<br>sociology or even psychology if you're<br>interested in history for example<br>you'll get a particular kind of version<br>of history through the history<br>department but if you're interested in<br>the history of literature or the history<br>of music or the history of film for<br>example then you should really think<br>about coming to school of arts and<br>studying with english or music<br>or any of our other disciplines like<br>international languages and cultures<br>we also because we're practitioners we<br>deal with contemporary media so we deal<br>with computing and contemporary and sort<br>of computing we deal with human<br>condition and psychology and we do deal<br>with the impact of media and society<br>attitudes and beliefs as they convey<br>through media and literature and other<br>aspects through the art through social<br>sciences so for example one of our dance<br>scholars is teaching on the climate<br>change um degree that we will be<br>offering very soon on you know the<br>impact of arts on uh and social activity<br>and sort of<br>uh around climate change or what the<br>arts can do in terms of you know<br>so looking at the school of arts um it's<br>really important to note that most jobs<br>out there in the industry require some<br>kind of arts based skills eighty percent<br>of jobs out there require arts based<br>skills so if you're coming here with a<br>particular idea of what you want to do<br>i'd also encourage you to think about<br>taking arts papers if what you want to<br>do is within one of the other schools in<br>our university<br>so arts jobs um<br>most of our students are sort of moving<br>to sort of arts specific related jobs<br>but they also move into very generic<br>areas of employment as well utilizing<br>their art skills such as being problem<br>solvers critical thinkers for example an<br>ability to communicate and express<br>themselves clearly<br>so just an example of that we have<br>students at the moment in politics who<br>didn't do a political science degree but<br>are doing arts degrees so our current<br>candidate for the green party in<br>hamilton comes out of the bachelor of<br>arts<br>and one of the youngest uh ever people<br>to sort of sort of<br>attempt to be amir hamilton was also one<br>of our graduates from the bachelor of<br>media and creative technologies and the<br>master of media creative technologies<br>so equally you can see science<br>background and arts backgrounds are<br>equally positive in the work world and<br>as you can see from the number of ceos<br>in companies they come just as much from<br>arts backgrounds as they do from science<br>backgrounds<br>so it's important for you to think about<br>the role of humanities and i really like<br>this little image here where science<br>might be able to do something the<br>humanities might<br>like want to tell you why that thing is<br>not a good idea uh you know with<br>reference to this image so critical<br>thinking problem solving is really part<br>of what we do<br>and so when you come here you will have<br>a choice of a major and you may have<br>already made that choice<br>and hopefully that's a major within the<br>school of arts but if not and you're<br>tuning in today think about a double<br>major or even using arts arts papers as<br>part of your electives so that's<br>something that i would really encourage<br>you to think about and think about how<br>arts also covers aspects of society<br>culture politics religion history and<br>philosophy and psychology okay i think i<br>can stop there i'd like to open it up<br>for any questions if there are any so<br>so i'll just hold on a few seconds to<br>see if any there are any burning<br>questions<br>so i've got a question here does this<br>include journalism we don't<br>teach journalism specifically but we do<br>teach aspects of visual journalism such<br>as reporting and so we teach documentary<br>for example<br>um we also teach uh visual literary uh<br>literacy skills um that are required by<br>most freelance uh journalists at the<br>moment so if you look at jobs around<br>freelance journalism those visual skills<br>are really important so those would come<br>through<br>professional writing studies<br>would support<br>any interest in journalism and so with<br>a question about video games uh at the<br>screen media department yes does have a<br>paper on video uh game design um it's<br>something i teach actually i that's why<br>i came here to new zealand in the first<br>place many many years ago<br>so obviously that covers part of our<br>interest in media we look at game design<br>from the point of view of<br>obviously creating games but we also<br>look at social impact games as well<br>the capacity of games to tell stories uh<br>and also sort of explore aspects of the<br>human conditions so some of the work<br>that i do is around representation of<br>death and dying for example and how we<br>can work through issues such as mental<br>health grief loss through video games so<br>a lot of work being done in many<br>different areas including english for<br>example<br>okay<br>yes um question around can you do maori<br>uh and do virtual journalism through the<br>arts um<br>maori in indigenous studies is a<br>separate faculty but it sits within the<br>ba or the bachelor of arts so you can<br>definitely do a double major or you can<br>do papers across both bachelor of arts<br>okay i've got a question about phds in<br>the arts<br>can you do public policy and cultural<br>projects<br>yes that's<br>almost definitely a possibility and what<br>we would probably look at is obviously<br>combining with our colleagues in the<br>school of social sciences as well<br>and<br>other areas of the university so<br>typically when someone comes into the<br>university for phd supervision they can<br>have a panel of supervisors<br>and we would we would produce expertise<br>from across<br>the university in order to support a<br>particular project so yes this is<br>definitely something that the colleagues<br>and researchers in the arts are<br>interested in but i would almost<br>certainly say that that would be in<br>combination with our colleagues in the<br>school of social science who are part of<br>the same division as us<br>okay<br>so i've got a question around theater<br>we've got a<br>excellent theater program at the moment<br>um really<br>good colleagues who<br>have done a fantastic job even during<br>lockdown so they've been they're<br>incredibly innovative incredibly um<br>active as practitioners they've got a<br>number of ongoing productions at the<br>moment there'll be plenty of<br>opportunities to be involved in<br>productions of students our former<br>colleagues um who've retired or also<br>take students on as part of their<br>production company so we have a very<br>active production company here um and<br>that theater department here<br>and plenty of opportunities for students<br>as well as getting involved in screen<br>and media in the studio production<br>papers and in the film production papers<br>as well<br>got from<br>finding out how to keep up with all<br>there are scholarships um it would be<br>probably best for you to follow that up<br>at the university level in terms of the<br>types of scholarships available there<br>are quite a number and a wide range of<br>scholarships available in order to study<br>here<br>including hillary scholarships and<br>various other scholarships so we have a<br>page dedicated to scholarships at the<br>university so i would just suggest that<br>you follow those up<br>and also that you could contact<br>colleagues like my support you could<br>contact me or other colleagues in the<br>school of arts to see if those<br>scholarships or eligibility to<br>scholarships would allow you to study in<br>the arts as well sorry i can't be any<br>more specific at this moment there's<br>lots of questions but i'm happy to<br>follow that up at a later date if you<br>typically there's a question here around<br>the beamers and so in the bmz we have an<br>academic stream a composition stream and<br>a performance stream and there's a<br>question here about getting into the<br>academic stream and the performance<br>stream typically yes the<br>performance stream does require<br>auditions<br>and we go through that process very<br>early on in the year<br>but if you're more interested in the<br>academic stream<br>then that won't necessarily have<br>auditions attached to it<br>there will also be plenty of<br>opportunities within the new bachelor of<br>communication to take elements of<br>more popular music if that's your<br>interest as well so we're expanding into<br>areas of more contemporary and popular<br>music and we have a number of<br>researchers within the screen and media<br>studies program who also are active<br>researchers in the area of popular and<br>contemporary music<br>so there are a number of opportunities<br>so if you don't want to go performance<br>and if that's not your focus you can<br>study it more academically here across a<br>range of different programs within the<br>school of arts as well as uh beyond the<br>bmi so you can actually do a music<br>major as part of the ba which would<br>allow you then to take further papers<br>from other programs such as screen and<br>media and other areas such as faculty of<br>uh maori and indigenous study that would<br>allow you to take a whole range of uh<br>music related papers so there's there's<br>quite a quite a number of them uh dotted<br>around the university to so that you<br>could sort of put together to comprise a<br>program of study for yourself i hope<br>right<br>so there's a question here around<br>electives different from field of degree<br>so we what you can see<br>on the structure on on the slides is<br>that yes within different degrees there<br>are different compulsory components<br>and some degrees around the university<br>will fill those little black boxes<br>those field of degree block boxes with<br>specified papers in the ba in particular<br>we leave those open so they are just<br>opportunities for you to take more<br>papers within the within the ba and that<br>can be within the whole range of the ba<br>if you do a double major then what you<br>see is yellow as part of your first<br>major then the red element of the degree<br>structure would also become yellow and<br>that would become yellow for a second<br>major and so that would be your two<br>double majors together if you only want<br>to do a single major obviously then the<br>red areas allow you to take have much<br>more freedom in terms of what you take<br>to complement your um you know your<br>particular major so one of the things<br>i'm saying here today is that if you're<br>interested in sociology or history or<br>anthropology and you want to study that<br>through the school of social sciences<br>there are elective papers that you could<br>take in the school of arts for example<br>that would allow you to study the<br>history of literature or the history of<br>film or other aspects of<br>history in a more contemporary or a<br>particular medium or specified medium or<br>even within a particular culture such as<br>international languages and cultures so<br>it's kind of up to you in terms of how<br>much freedom you want to give yourself<br>beyond your major so most most people at<br>school when they're thinking about<br>university focus on what major they want<br>to do but as you can see from the the<br>degree structure that we have here in<br>waikato there are a lot more choices<br>that you have to make when you come here<br>so even within the compulsory black<br>areas there are still choices available<br>to you and obviously if you just do a<br>single major then you've got a heap of<br>choices to make which could be quite<br>freeing<br>but if you've got quite a strong idea<br>about what you want to do when you leave<br>university you may want to just to<br>choose two double majors that you think<br>complement one another and just leave<br>your choices to those field degree areas<br>so really down to you and what your<br>particular interests are but we can<br>certainly help you with those<br>discussions if you get in touch with the<br>university and and um you know get in<br>touch with our sort of student advisors<br>here in in the um<br>division of arts<br>so there's questions difference between<br>arts and social science faculties<br>both<br>both the schools um deliver<br>majors in the va and the b socks psi<br>and<br>for if your major is based in the school<br>of social sciences then if you do it as<br>part of the ba what you'll you'll see<br>very little difference so there's very<br>little difference the biggest difference<br>will be in those black areas in the<br>compulsory papers so the compulsory<br>elements of the degree will be different<br>for the ba and the b sock side but your<br>major would largely remain the same if<br>you're choosing a major from school of<br>social sciences<br>we have two majors in these<br>bachelor of social sciences that we<br>teach out of the school of arts<br>and for us we are making those different<br>so good to give you an example in screen<br>and media<br>the ba<br>you would do film production and you<br>would do creative work but if you were<br>to do screen and media in the be soccer<br>psi you'd be concentrating mostly on the<br>you know impacts on society the you know<br>impact of media the role of media in<br>society and culture how it changes<br>attitudes and beliefs more political<br>dimensions to the media ownership<br>control etcetera so there's a different<br>emphasis depending on what you do um<br>whether you do a ba or b sock site but<br>take note to just check the major in<br>both those degrees but i think you'll<br>largely find that they remain the same<br>um but what you do in the compulsory<br>sections is the main difference so<br>there's methodologies papers in the<br>bachelor of social science where there<br>are more sort of critical analytical<br>papers in the ba to help you understand<br>and interpret different texts from<br>culture<br>there's a question about needing an<br>audition as part of theater studies<br>that's a really good question i should<br>know that as head of school but i am not<br>100 sure um so it's one that i should<br>follow up with colleagues so if you<br>wanted to<br>contact<br>colleagues in theater studies and just<br>double check that one or two don't<br>follow it up with me as head of school<br>gareth shot you'll find my email i can<br>give you a definitive answer to that but<br>i think um that it's not a requirement<br>for for theater studies<br>but i may be wrong so that's a really<br>good question i should know the answer<br>to that<br>okay<br>can i do electives from other schools<br>with my b mus such as chemistry<br>the bmo's is largely uh filled with<br>music papers so because music owned that<br>particular degree it is quite full<br>however i would never say that that's<br>not a possibility um because we try to<br>tailor um study until two students needs<br>in particular so it may not be the case<br>that a bemas might be the best option<br>but it might be a ba as i've said before<br>so if you do music as part of a ba you<br>might then have more options to take<br>papers from across the ba in the<br>different programs that are available<br>and other aspects of the university you<br>can take a conjoint degree which means<br>you can come out to the university with<br>two different degrees so if we can't<br>find a way of making something that<br>might seem quite<br>distinctive from one another and not so<br>obviously complementary as you know<br>music and chemistry there are other<br>options like doing a conjoint degree so<br>it ends up that you come out with two<br>different kinds of degrees like a bemas<br>and a bachelor of science for example so<br>so i hope that answers your question are<br>we finishing now no more time for any<br>questions okay i'm afraid that's it um<br>thank you for all your questions that's<br>fantastic if you do feel the need to<br>follow any of this up you have my name<br>you can watch this again online and you<br>can definitely follow this up with me<br>and i can put you in touch with people<br>who can answer your questions with more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
