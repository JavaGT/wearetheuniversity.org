is kennedy i am the<br>future student team leader for the<br>university of waikato and i'm based<br>at our tauranga campus in our student<br>recruitment team basically so it's my<br>job to<br>help answer any questions that you might<br>have about studying at the university<br>basically in this session we're going to<br>cover the facilities that we have<br>for students studying in tauranga some<br>of the courses that you can study with<br>us<br>specific scholarships relevant to<br>students considering studying in<br>tauranga<br>and then support services as well as<br>answer any questions that might come up<br>towards the end so basically<br>the university has a campus in the cbd<br>with the heart of the city<br>and it has capacity for just over 1500<br>students<br>so we really have one main building and<br>then there's a separate building next<br>door which is our science and<br>engineering labs<br>and this is our main building in town<br>and the roadworks have now been<br>completed<br>the photo's a little old but this is<br>basically a one-stop shop where all of<br>our students no matter what they're<br>studying<br>study from this one building uh it's got<br>large open plan spaces where you can<br>study in between your classes meet with<br>your friends<br>in your groups in group meeting rooms<br>for group projects<br>as well as catch up with any staff that<br>you need to so it's a very flexible<br>learning environment and the classrooms<br>are designed also so that<br>they can be adjusted based on what<br>classes in them<br>whatever's better so we've got one<br>lecture theater in this particular<br>building and it can set just over 200<br>students<br>and the rest of the classrooms are just<br>standard classrooms where you can move<br>the desks around<br>as you need to next door we also have<br>our science<br>engineering labs um so we've got one<br>engineering lab<br>and then two science labs so students<br>that are looking at studying the<br>sciences or engineering<br>will obviously have those facilities as<br>well<br>also in toronto but not in the cbd we<br>have the adams center for high<br>performance which is where some of our<br>health sport and human performance<br>students will get to spend a bit of time<br>particularly if you're doing higher<br>level study or research projects<br>um this particular centre is the home of<br>the bay of pliny rugby union as well as<br>the new zealand sevens rugby teams so<br>there's some pretty<br>cool athletes that get to train in this<br>space so as a student studying<br>sport with us you'll get to spend a bit<br>of time hopefully<br>at that particular facility<br>we also have a coastal marine field<br>station<br>which is where you can look at studying<br>aquaculture<br>or marine sciences with us<br>which is right on the down at the port<br>by sulphur point and we have students<br>that was<br>that are studying their masters<br>such things down there as well so that's<br>again another pretty cool space<br>for students um interested in the marine<br>sciences side of things as well<br>in terms of the courses that we have on<br>offer in toronto<br>we do have some specific programs for<br>example you could do a bachelor of arts<br>in any of these subjects law maori and<br>indigenous studies<br>political sciences psychology social<br>policy and sociology<br>we can offer our business programs the<br>bachelor of business which is a<br>three-year business degree<br>in accounting finance marketing or<br>strategic management<br>with our bachelor of engineering you can<br>do year one of the program in year four<br>of the program from our campus here in<br>toronto with the facilities that we have<br>it does mean that you do need to either<br>travel to hamilton in year two and three<br>or move to hamilton for year two and<br>three but in particular<br>if you're looking at civil engineering<br>electrical and electronic engineering<br>mechanical or mechatronic engineering<br>those programs can be started and<br>finished with us here in toronto<br>with the bachelor of health sport and<br>human performance you can start and<br>finish that whole degree with us in<br>tauranga<br>in any of the three majors community<br>health human performance science<br>we then also have our law program so you<br>can complete the first<br>two years of the four-year law degree<br>which is<br>the diploma in law and you can do those<br>first two years like i say in toronto<br>and you potentially look at traveling to<br>hamilton for year three and four as<br>needed<br>in the science space you can do the<br>bachelor of science with majors in<br>computer science<br>aquaculture environmental sciences and<br>psychology fully here in toronto<br>and then we're back to the bachelor of<br>social sciences so political sciences<br>psychology<br>social policy sociology digital learning<br>and might and indigenous studies can<br>also all be completed here in tauranga<br>we have our four-year bachelor of social<br>work<br>program which can actually only be<br>studied with the university of waikato<br>at the tauranga<br>so that's one of the few programs that<br>you can only study with us here<br>and that's an accredited program so at<br>the end of that you can go out and start<br>to become a registered social worker<br>we also have our teaching program which<br>is very strong here in tauranga<br>so you could do our three-year bachelor<br>of teaching in either early childhood<br>primary or kokanuruwa<br>and our one-year diploma in tutuhu<br>paitahi which is the maori language<br>program<br>so those are the majority of our<br>undergraduate study options we also do<br>have some postgraduate study options<br>available<br>um and you can ask me questions about<br>them or find out more about them on our<br>website<br>if those were your particular interests<br>lie<br>some of the services that we have for<br>students who are studying here in tonoma<br>one of them<br>includes the kaimai shuttle so this is a<br>free shuttle service<br>that takes students from the toronto<br>campus to the hamilton campus<br>daily monday to fridays and it leaves<br>from the tauranga campus at either 7am<br>or 9am in the morning<br>taking you to hamilton and then you can<br>catch the return at either 3 or 5 p.m so<br>basically what this shuttle does is it<br>allows students who<br>may want to stay living in toronto if<br>you're already here<br>or considering moving to tauranga it<br>allows you to take a few more subjects<br>than what we offer here in toronto<br>because it means that you can study<br>some of those additional subjects that<br>we only offer in hamilton with a little<br>bit of travel between those campuses<br>as you need to for classes the shuttle<br>is also wi-fi enabled so<br>if you wanted to do some of your course<br>readings in the van on the way over in<br>the morning or write an assignment<br>or even just sit there and put your<br>headphones in and listen to music<br>you're welcome to do that you can use<br>that time however you like so that's a<br>really amazing<br>service for our students that are based<br>we've got some specific scholarships for<br>students that might be considering<br>um studying at the tauranga campus there<br>are obviously the general scholarships<br>as well that<br>it doesn't matter what campus you're<br>studying at for example the<br>edmond hillary scholarship which is the<br>ten thousand dollar<br>a year program for high performing<br>sports or cultural performing arts<br>as well as the corti tangeta scholarship<br>which is up to five thousand dollars for<br>um a range of different criteria that<br>one can be applied for but the rest of<br>them up here are specifically for<br>students who are either<br>living in tauranga or from the taurama<br>region or looking at studying at the<br>tauranga campus<br>so there are three acorn foundation<br>scholarships that we offer<br>which have a value of three thousand<br>dollars or up to three thousand dollars<br>um and those are specifically for people<br>living in the bay of plenty<br>we have the tauranga first and family<br>scholarship<br>and the campus residential scholarship<br>which are both for students who are<br>studying at the tauranga campus<br>so it doesn't matter necessarily where<br>you're from provided that you're<br>studying at the tanua campus you can be<br>eligible for those particular<br>scholarships<br>as well and every little bit of money<br>helps when it count<br>comes towards university costs um so<br>those are definitely worth looking at<br>if you think those are relevant to you<br>we of course have a range of support<br>services on this campus to support our<br>students<br>so in the health and wellbeing space we<br>have a nurse who's permanently<br>on site during the week and she can<br>refer you to the doctors that are<br>off-site for a discounted rate if you<br>need<br>as well as a discounted gym so there's<br>student prices at one of the gyms just<br>around the corner from us<br>which can make their gym membership a<br>bit more affordable<br>on campus we've got our student hub on<br>level one when you first come into the<br>building and that's where you can get<br>any help<br>in terms of enrollment support uh you<br>can meet with the team there for general<br>um if you've just got any general<br>questions about where your classes are<br>or picking up your id card any of that<br>kind of stuff<br>they can also book meeting rooms for you<br>if you're wanting to meet with a group<br>or just get a bit of quiet time away<br>from<br>the hustle and bustle of the the rest of<br>the students on campus if you're working<br>on something<br>um so the student hub's a really good<br>place to start<br>myself and my colleague and the future<br>students team are obviously here to help<br>support the transition<br>from wherever you are now to university<br>so that's around helping<br>tell you what courses we offer the entry<br>requirements and what specific papers<br>you might need to study and help with<br>your enrolment<br>um so that's before you get to the<br>university<br>when you're here there's also the<br>student union that can help when you're<br>enrolled as a student so they can help<br>with advocacy<br>financial support and they also run a<br>lot of events on campus<br>to keep the students happy before you<br>start your classes we have a<br>thorough orientation program so it's<br>where you get to meet other students<br>figure out what the lay of the campus is<br>where your classes might be<br>before your classes start which is<br>another good way<br>to settle in and then during your time<br>at university there's help<br>in the careers services space so if<br>you're looking for a job<br>um or you're getting towards the end of<br>your studies and you need help with your<br>cv<br>writing or interview techniques you can<br>make an appointment with them and you<br>can meet with them one-on-one<br>for assistance in that space um and<br>student learning support can help with<br>your academic<br>concerns while you're at university so<br>helping out with<br>essay writing preparing for tests you<br>know what's the best way to study<br>some tips on things like that as well as<br>the<br>all-important um how to correctly apa<br>reference<br>when you're doing your assignments and<br>all that kind of stuff so there's<br>plenty of support services on campus<br>for our students that are studying with<br>it's pretty much everything that i have<br>to say on<br>studying at the tauranga campus but i've<br>put my details up here so if you do have<br>any further questions<br>you're welcome to send me an email or<br>give me a phone call<br>or there's some general links to<br>the website and general email addresses<br>along the bottom there as well so you're<br>welcome to<br>ask anything that you may have just<br>double check<br>the live chat<br>can i figure this out see if there's any<br>questions<br>um so if you do have
