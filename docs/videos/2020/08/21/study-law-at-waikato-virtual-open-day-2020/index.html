tank<br>at the university of waikato you will be<br>taught by<br>the leading experts in their field<br>classes of course are small and<br>typically offer offered in summerstein<br>discussions and we have an open door<br>policy we have a very very<br>strong student focus<br>and um of course<br>we provide opportunities<br>whereby students can consult and meet<br>with staff one-on-one<br>to obtain critical feedback on their<br>assessment and coursework and also just<br>general feedback on how<br>they are progressing through their<br>degree program<br>of course moving on to the types of<br>degree options that we have here<br>first of all we have the diploma in law<br>but we also have a number of other<br>popular conjoined programs as well<br>from the bachelor of arts and bachelor<br>of laws to the conjoint of social<br>sciences and law<br>and of course you can also pursue your<br>degree<br>jointly with science of technology or<br>even management studies<br>so we have a whole wide range of options<br>to<br>suit you we<br>moving on to the type of individualized<br>ongoing support that we can offer<br>students in our faculty<br>we have three very dynamic law student<br>associations<br>we have the pacific law student<br>association<br>we have the maori students association<br>and of course the waikato's law student<br>association<br>and they of course those three and<br>law student associations are really<br>really important<br>in that they foster great collegial<br>relations between students<br>and of course offer plenty of social<br>learning opportunities because of course<br>during your time at university<br>you will meet people that will become<br>your lifelong friends<br>and of course um being a member of<br>one of those law student associations or<br>indeed all of them<br>provides you with that um enriching<br>social and learning experience we have a<br>mentorship program as well in our in our<br>faculty which makes us quite unique<br>amongst<br>new zealand law schools and our<br>mentorship<br>program is designed to offer you extra<br>support<br>our mentors our law students in their<br>senior years of study<br>and they will provide guidance to you in<br>your studies<br>how to help you navigate through your<br>transitional period as you settle into<br>law school<br>and also can help provide you with<br>guidance on applying for internship and<br>work experience opportunities as well<br>and of course we have a wonderful<br>administrative team here that are on<br>hand<br>to advise you on any aspect of your<br>study options and can assist you<br>as well in providing advice on degree<br>and planning<br>another unique point about bring a<br>faculty of<br>law is that we are the only law school<br>in new zealand that is accredited by the<br>arbitrators and mediators institute of<br>new zealand<br>so if you're thinking about pursuing a<br>career as an arbitrator<br>or mediator well white cato stands out<br>from that point of view our degree is<br>accredited<br>by this very important institution so<br>essentially if you pursue<br>your degree here uh once you graduate it<br>means that you are automatically a<br>member<br>of this professional organization and<br>you can specialize<br>in arbitration and mediation um<br>as and in particular this is a quite a<br>growth area um in law<br>of course many of you will be interested<br>in pursuing a career as<br>a as a solicitor or barrister and of<br>course our bachelor of laws<br>degree program here is approved by the<br>new zealand council of legal education<br>and of course after graduation here you<br>will be eligible<br>to complete the professional legal<br>studies course at either the college of<br>law<br>new zealand or the professional<br>legal studies<br>course at the institute of legal studies<br>so during your degree here you can<br>pursue a number of different papers you<br>can pursue courses on advocacy<br>mediation public international law<br>corporate securities and finance<br>employment law environmental law the law<br>of the sea<br>maori land law natural resources law<br>family in law of course but over the<br>course of the<br>um next um few minutes<br>and i've only about 10 minutes or so<br>left in my presentation<br>i'm going to introduce you to one of the<br>papers and that's offered by<br>teppering a factory of law and it is<br>so at tempering our faculty of law we<br>offer a paper called critical issues<br>in space law and the aim of this paper<br>is to introduce students to how<br>law applies in the outer space realm<br>now of course during the course of the<br>paper<br>you would have the opportunity to engage<br>with external guest speakers so for<br>example in 2021 we have a number of<br>speakers<br>and lined up from nasa and<br>um from the us military to discuss<br>issues concerning military operations in<br>outer space<br>but the aim of this paper as well<br>is introduce you to the commercial<br>aspects of outer space<br>if a private corporation wants to launch<br>a satellite into outer space<br>what are the laws regulating that launch<br>and of course up until now outer space<br>law was very much<br>viewed as the<br>prerogative of states but of course as<br>we've seen recently in the media<br>it is private corporations like rocket<br>labs space<br>x etc that they are becoming are at the<br>very very forefront<br>of the space race so a paper looks at<br>the environmental aspects um<br>concerning the regulation of outer space<br>it looks like it looks like whether<br>military activity is permitted in outer<br>space<br>it looks at the laws regulating<br>satellite remote sensing<br>it examines um how disputes concerning<br>outer space are resolved<br>what's quite unique about outer space<br>law is that there is no<br>an international court that can<br>resolve disputes that may occur<br>between corporations and states<br>so for example if a corporation designs<br>a satellite launches into space but has<br>an agreement with the state<br>that the state will pay for that<br>satellite over time<br>and actually fails to keep up with our<br>payments well what right of recourse<br>have<br>where we are from there as you see in<br>the little diagram<br>before you just included some quite<br>useful stats<br>and in that<br>particular um photo of planet earth you<br>will see<br>all the satellites that's typical of the<br>number of satellites<br>that are circling around our planet at<br>any one time<br>and of course our paper at the<br>university of haikato aims to<br>respond to a key gap um in the industry<br>um increasingly there is a need for<br>lawyers that<br>specialize in outer space law because as<br>you can see<br>from that diagram because the sheer<br>level of activity in outer space that's<br>going to lead to<br>legal disputes and of course during the<br>course of the paper you will discover<br>some really really interesting facts so<br>for example an astronaut<br>has for example lost a glove and that is<br>whizzing around<br>in the ether running at 28 000<br>kilometers an hour<br>and of course um the glove was lost by<br>an<br>astronaut named ever white if that glove<br>caused damage to a russian satellite<br>well what right has that<br>has russia for example to sue the united<br>states for the damage caused by it<br>and of course there have been instances<br>over time where<br>um the states when one of their<br>satellites<br>becomes obsolete um it may be<br>decommissioned and some states have<br>decided that<br>they will just blow up that satellite<br>with the missile<br>and of course that has led to major<br>concerns amongst the international<br>community<br>about the environmental<br>impact that has because of course um<br>if we destroy satellites in this way it<br>leads to<br>a lot of debris in outer space that can<br>cause damage<br>to um current functioning satellites<br>and of course the law is very very<br>ambiguous and vague about all this<br>we have no clear rules about how um<br>we should protect the environment in<br>outer space<br>for example with the moon missions in<br>the 1960s 1970s<br>over 190 um tons<br>of human waste was left by<br>those missions on the moon and of course<br>only a handful of individuals actually<br>went to the moon<br>so us as lawyers we have to very very<br>carefully consider<br>how we protect outer space not only for<br>the present generation but for<br>future generations to come as well<br>so that is to briefly um introduce you<br>to the types of degrees that we offer<br>here<br>and the type of papers that we offer<br>here<br>and indeed um i would highly highly<br>recommend that you come<br>and study here here at the university of<br>waikato<br>we offer really really inclusive um<br>student experience pastoral care is at<br>the very very top of the agenda to<br>ensure<br>that you are supported during your<br>studies here from day one<br>until the day you try to graduate and<br>even after that<br>um our scholars here keep in contact<br>with our students<br>to ensure that they are making that<br>transition from their degree program<br>on to um into their professional and<br>career<br>so again studying at the university of<br>waikato gives you that opportunity to<br>study one of the top universe<br>top law schools in the world we again<br>provide a number of work and employment<br>opportunities for our students<br>and you can pursue your study here in a<br>fantastic<br>modern multi-million dollar building<br>where we have a dedicated new court room<br>where you can practice<br>your arbitration and mediation skills<br>and your advocacy skills<br>in court and again<br>you will be taught by some of new<br>zealand's leading<br>legal experts as well for example<br>professor al gillespie who is widely<br>sought after by the media to colleagues<br>such as<br>um associate professor valmie tiptoki<br>who has provided strategic support to<br>the united nations on indigenous studies<br>to other colleagues that have advised in<br>the defense of war criminals<br>at the un's international criminal<br>tribunal for the former yugoslavia<br>and had by and have advised judges on<br>war crimes cases<br>and crimes against humanity cases at the<br>international<br>criminal court so what i'm going to do<br>very quickly<br>is just have a look at the chat function<br>here to see<br>if there are any questions at all<br>i see there are not but if there's<br>anybody that would like to ask a<br>question<br>okay so thank you um<br>the first question is whether um waikato<br>offers<br>um commercial law so we offer a whole<br>range of different papers<br>um if you just give me a few moments and<br>dig out the<br>information for you we offer contract<br>law we<br>offer um corporate securities and<br>finance laws essentially that is<br>corporate law and commercial law there<br>in a nutshell we also um<br>depending on of course um<br>student and students requests we offer<br>papers like revenue law as well i hope<br>that answered your question okay but<br>please<br>um if anything needs further<br>clarification please do use<br>the chat function and i will do my best<br>to answer your question<br>and if not i will try and direct you to<br>the necessary resources online<br>and of course i suppose i should add as<br>well that even in the outer space law<br>paper that i offer here<br>that i teach at the university of white<br>cattle we looked at we look specifically<br>at the commercial aspects of outer space<br>activity as well<br>and another question has popped up in<br>the chat function is there a certain<br>amount of spaces for the second year<br>no there's not essentially if you if you<br>pass<br>um all your papers in your first year<br>you automatically go into your second<br>year<br>here that is what's quite unique about<br>um tempering a factory of law<br>um other you know other law schools of<br>course um<br>do require that you have to have<br>achieved a specific grade in order<br>to enter into your second year that is<br>not the case here at the university of<br>wycattle<br>i hope that clarifies your question but<br>again if you need any further<br>information please let me know<br>i think yeah yeah i think<br>that's probably it of course if there's<br>any aspect of our degree<br>options here that you would like further<br>information on and please do<br>let me know whether it be the type of<br>pastoral care<br>that we offer to support students to the<br>types of<br>student um so the types of activities<br>that are run by your student association<br>to even um<br>what type of career options you will<br>have after you pursue your degree<br>okay so we have a really interesting<br>question here from raj<br>thank you raj and you mentioned that<br>you're planning to pursue a master's of<br>law by qatar university<br>and you you've done your llb overseas<br>um<br>your question is whether it's possible<br>for you to gain practical job knowledge<br>in new zealand<br>after doing your llm from waikato<br>university<br>well if you have um if you're<br>um it will ultimately depend on the type<br>of<br>visa that you obtain from new zealand<br>immigration<br>um again our student advisors at our<br>central university team will be able to<br>advise you further on the type of<br>student visas<br>and that are available and whether you<br>can<br>convert that visa into a work visa after<br>your degree<br>here okay i hope that helps to clarify<br>your question but again<br>what i would recommend is if you consult<br>with the<br>the resources um uh<br>prepared by our admission office on um<br>on immigration and visas<br>and<br>work requirements etc i i would really<br>highly recommend that you get in touch<br>with them<br>okay i think we have another<br>question from i think it's<br>it's flynn um<br>how is the environment for phd studies<br>excellent question<br>absolutely superb thank you very much<br>but if you want to do a phd here<br>at the law school we have a whole<br>variety of supports for you<br>academic staff are trained<br>phd supervisors and of course<br>during your phd studies here um

our<br>students and our phd students<br>have dedicated offices with dedicated<br>computers<br>as well to facilitate you and of course<br>um<br>our phd phd students come along to<br>all our research
