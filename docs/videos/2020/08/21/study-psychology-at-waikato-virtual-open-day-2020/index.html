little<br>um so i'll be talking about why<br>psychology and<br>why why kato why you you might choose to<br>do psychology with us<br>and i'll cover a little bit about the<br>structure of the psychology degree<br>here at waikato the first year second<br>and third years<br>and the link between research and<br>teaching<br>and as a little bit about our school and<br>who who who is part of our school of<br>psychology<br>and then because you might be also<br>interested i'll be talking about careers<br>in psychology<br>you know what can you do afterwards and<br>i'll be mentioning a few examples<br>throughout my presentation about careers<br>and how you can apply<br>psychological knowledge to many domains<br>uh<br>of life and many business<br>so why psychology well as you can<br>guess i imagine it's a really<br>challenging stimulating and rewarding<br>field of study<br>is a area of knowledge that can be<br>applied to many domains<br>because we study human behavior in<br>humans<br>so it's quite important we are<br>dealing with a pandemic for example a<br>lot of people are studying psychological<br>distress how people<br>is how people scoping to to the pandemic<br>interpersonal relations family relations<br>and so on<br>so you can see that psychology can be<br>applied to<br>to many areas and is a really important<br>topic<br>there are also many careers options<br>if you decide to study psychology um<br>so there is one area that involves a lot<br>of professional training<br>and i'm going to highlight few of these<br>areas here in new zealand<br>so you need to to do a psychology degree<br>in order to become<br>a registered psychologist but<br>psychology psychological knowledge can<br>be applied to many domains and i'm going<br>to give<br>some examples later on but it involves<br>from you know organizational settings to<br>government settings<br>uh high education science and so on<br>so broadly is a really highly valued<br>degree<br>because you acquire lots of knowledge<br>and knowledge that can<br>be implemented in different settings<br>and i'm going to mention some of these<br>skills uh<br>so why why kato we offer really high<br>level uh<br>education uh we have really committed<br>and approachable staff<br>uh some of our teaching involves really<br>small<br>groups um so you can have this<br>opportunity of<br>really in that interaction with your<br>peers<br>and as well as with the the lecturers<br>and the professors<br>um the university overall provides a lot<br>of support for students<br>um and this can be uh the educational<br>aspect of it um for example how to write<br>in in the scientific or university level<br>but also counseling and<br>other support systems that could help<br>you during the<br>university years we also offer a really<br>versatile degree<br>for psychology at waikato indeed<br>you can do three main areas or three<br>main degrees you can do a bachelor's of<br>arts<br>you can do a bachelor's of social<br>science and also bachelor<br>of science in psychology with measuring<br>in psychology<br>so um the school of psychology indeed<br>offers<br>one of the uh many of<br>many options you know it's one unique<br>degree within<br>waikato because of this vessel<br>so the the diploma or the degree of<br>psychology involves<br>three years so the first year you take<br>a basic introduct introduction to<br>psychology papers<br>and then the second year and third year<br>you specialize a little bit more in an<br>area of psychology that you'll be more<br>interested<br>and then in the third year there are<br>many<br>uh costs that you can uh choose from<br>and again you can specialize in<br>in an area that you're more interested<br>and these are courses within psychology<br>but of<br>course there are related courses across<br>and social sciences<br>science and arts that you can talk you<br>can take to<br>complete your degree in psychology so<br>it's a really complete foundation within<br>psychology in the first year you're<br>going to be exposed to many<br>areas of psychology and during the first<br>and second year you can decide<br>which area you want to focus more you<br>can focus on<br>studying mainly behavior mainly<br>cognition<br>or developmental aspects of psychology<br>or<br>community social psychology or applied<br>aspects of psychology<br>so again there are many options and it's<br>quite a flexible<br>degree so what are these skills<br>that you can learn so psychology<br>graduates are valued<br>for the combination of content<br>information so psychology based<br>knowledge but also transferable skills<br>and i'm going to list some of them<br>here i'm not going to go into the detail<br>but you can read<br>on these slides so you're going to learn<br>some literacy on the higher level you<br>know<br>in 30 area education university level<br>also numeracy statistics and how to<br>understand<br>science and it relates to scientific<br>thinking<br>the next point that i have that all<br>these<br>other skills include interpersonal<br>interpersonal awareness<br>um self-knowledge and uh understanding<br>how to interact<br>with others and in group settings um<br>you're going to learn a lot of<br>problem solving skills and many of our<br>graduates<br>use those skills quite heavily in the in<br>the career<br>and something that we emphasize quite a<br>lot in our<br>in our course other three<br>excuse that you you would learn um if<br>you decide to take psychology files<br>is critical evaluation analyzing um<br>scientific publications or any text<br>for its content and facts<br>information gathering skills so how to<br>to search for reliable and factual<br>information<br>and the ability to work independently<br>and another is a really important<br>skill that we we foster<br>in our students so a little bit about<br>the school of psychology<br>um we have 26 academics and research<br>staff<br>um so these are the the folks<br>responsible for teaching<br>and conducting research and helping uh<br>students and<br>and staff in conducting their work<br>we also have technical and<br>administrative support staff<br>and currently we have over post-graduate<br>students so<br>students who are doing a master's or phd<br>in psychology with us<br>last year we had over 120<br>students graduating with us and<br>if you look at the the report that the<br>government produces<br>looking at the the quality of the<br>teaching and research within<br>new zealand universities the team<br>here the school of psychology at waikato<br>scores really high<br>uh in those markets of research<br>achievement<br>so how do we teach often<br>our methods include lectures large-scale<br>lectures uh of course because of the<br>pandemic<br>this has been mainly online<br>and through recordings like this one<br>but we also run small labs as i<br>mentioned with small groups so you can<br>have<br>a greater interaction with your peers<br>and with the professors but we also run<br>specific workshops in particular topics<br>so we<br>we cover a a large<br>way of teaching and delivering<br>psychological content<br>but overall our teachings organizing<br>these six main areas within psychology<br>we cover developmental<br>cognitive psychology indigenous and<br>social psychology<br>and we also uh discuss historical and<br>conception<br>conceptual issues within psychology and<br>one aspect is really important for our<br>degree<br>is research methods and statistics so<br>it's something that i know<br>um some students are a bit uh scared of<br>statistics but the way we teach is in uh<br>we we focus on applied application of<br>statistics and research methods so that<br>the content is much more<br>um is easier to to together<br>and is more interesting to learn as well<br>but again is a really important aspect<br>of our degree<br>it's research methods and statistics<br>so why do we link teaching and research<br>we believe that our teaching is much<br>better<br>and well informed if we combine that<br>with teaching<br>sorry our teaching with research and<br>most of our staff of<br>all of our stats our staff are involved<br>in current<br>research um so we<br>carried out research and i'm going to<br>illustrate some of the areas<br>um we we cover and we bring those<br>real life from our own research<br>experience<br>and and learnings to our classrooms so<br>it's up to date and quite engaging<br>the way we teach at waikato it's<br>important to note that not all<br>schools in new zealand schools of<br>psychology in new zealand<br>have this strong link between teaching<br>and research so we are quite unique in<br>that front<br>so as i mentioned we we do a lot of<br>research so some of us<br>study um how we see movement so<br>visual perception others study<br>mindfulness and meditation and how it<br>affect our health and well-being<br>others study how how to help children<br>learn and behave better at schools<br>others study the effects of head<br>injuries<br>a colleague is training dogs to sniff<br>drugs<br>disease and explosives others are<br>working on how to reduce family violence<br>other others are studying organizational<br>psychology so how to improve<br>employee and work-life balances um and<br>hr<br>and so on myself i study environmental<br>psychology how<br>psychology can help to address climate<br>change and others study<br>how um how people behave when they take<br>uh alcohol and if how it affects that<br>driving and of course we do that<br>in a simulation so what are the careers<br>in psychology as i said there are some<br>areas that you can<br>study further and do some training to be<br>a recognized and accredited psychologist<br>in new zealand and these include the<br>clinical psychology community<br>occupational forensic behavioral<br>analysis and health<br>so these are areas that you can study<br>further and<br>be a registered qualified psychologist<br>and in that case you can be called a<br>community psychologist a clinical<br>psychologist<br>and so on but as i mentioned before<br>the degree of psychology is quite broad<br>and can be applied to many many areas<br>i'm just<br>illustrating few areas here so you might<br>decide to<br>work in business and industry and you<br>can decide to invest<br>your career in psychological knowledge<br>in marketing<br>you can do uh assessment of<br>of clients or people applying for jobs<br>so psychometrics<br>you can work in hr in recruitment<br>selection<br>and training of personnel you can decide<br>to work in<br>as a manager so you can apply um<br>knowledge on<br>leadership decision making to managing<br>retail and manage managing stuff you<br>might decide to work for government or<br>ngo<br>uh organizations um i have for example<br>many former students who became data<br>analysts<br>or policy analysts helping the<br>government to make decisions<br>you might decide to become an academic<br>or a scientist so you can focus on<br>research<br>and teaching some of you might already<br>know that<br>psychology has been offered in new<br>zealand at the high school level so you<br>might decide to go back and teach<br>at high school so become a teacher of<br>psychology at high school<br>but you can progress further and do a<br>master's a phd and become an academic<br>or work as a scientist within psychology<br>and there are many other areas um you<br>can work as a speech therapist<br>a civil servant as i mentioned and even<br>in<br>its or information technology<br>so that's me if you want to<br>get more information about
