university of<br>waikato but it actually<br>actually is welcome to my kitchen<br>because i'm working from home today<br>um how are you i don't know how many are<br>out there please feel free to send me<br>chats and ask me questions<br>at any stage you like otherwise this<br>might be the world's<br>shortest presentation i do have some<br>cats wandering around the kitchen for<br>entertainment value but<br>they've disappeared just when i needed<br>them<br>um so i have a very very simple little<br>powerpoint it's a two-page powerpoint i<br>think it's the<br>fifth powerpoint i've ever used uh in<br>about<br>20 years i don't generally use them you<br>young people with your modern<br>technologies<br>anyway my role is i support 10<br>participants hello everybody<br>my role as head of school is that i have<br>responsibility<br>for the programs that are within within<br>our school<br>the seven main programs and i think we<br>have<br>each program can be thought of as having<br>a major which means<br>you get your degree in that subject or<br>that major and i think we have about<br>seven minors so we're a very very uh<br>diverse organization or entity<br>i have 41 staff academic staff<br>working in the school of social sciences<br>and we are mainly in the ijk block<br>if you want to come on campus and visit<br>us though we might find out at help past<br>five this evening<br>that we won't be visiting anybody for a<br>long while or three or four weeks anyway<br>i've got a little document here that i'm<br>going to try and share with you<br>oh<br>it was very exciting and that's uh<br>that's not me<br>um nice furniture though i think she's<br>do you think she has any tea or coffee<br>in that mug or is it just<br>an empty mug um anyway uh<br>this is this is the beginning of my<br>slideshow which i think has three clicks<br>relating to it so brace yourself feel<br>free to<br>ask me a question at any stage so<br>welcome to the school of social sciences<br>kiara<br>the first thing we should talk about is<br>and this becomes quite confusing to<br>lots of people is that the school of<br>social sciences<br>is really made up by the subjects or the<br>majors<br>that you can major in or that you can<br>take from anthropology through to social<br>work if you want to go from a to z<br>just like the school of arts is<br>um a grouping made up of<br>things ranging from media to music to<br>performance and those sorts of things<br>you can do different degrees<br>across the different schools and we have<br>some degrees in common<br>so the school of social sciences and the<br>school of arts<br>they have students who are majoring in<br>the bachelor of arts and they have<br>students<br>majoring in the bachelor of social<br>sciences and we have students<br>majoring in the bachelor of arts and<br>majoring in the bachelor of social<br>sciences<br>the difference being what topics or<br>majors or<br>programs they are um taking to finish<br>their degrees<br>we have four main degrees at this<br>university that you can take in subjects<br>or majors or programs<br>in the school of social sciences they're<br>the bachelor of arts the ba which is<br>probably the most<br>widely known undergraduate degree um<br>that<br>in the world probably certainly in um<br>australia and new zealand<br>uh in britain so the bachelor of arts<br>you can only do that<br>on the hamilton campus as it currently<br>stands<br>you can only do the bachelor of arts on<br>the hamilton campus<br>in subjects in the school of social<br>sciences<br>and we also have the bachelor of social<br>sciences<br>which you can take in the school of<br>social sciences and you can do that<br>either at hamilton or in tauranga<br>so that's um that's available at both<br>campuses<br>that's the most popular degree amongst<br>students<br>who are enrolled in programs at the<br>bachelor of social sciences um<br>and in fact the bachelor of social<br>sciences is a degree<br>that um only the university of waikato<br>offers it's one of the points of<br>difference between us and the other<br>universities in new zealand<br>and it's a very very successful degree<br>it's the degree that we are probably<br>most closely aligned with<br>though the fact that you've got you know<br>it isn't just us that teach the bachelor<br>of social sciences<br>the faculty of maori indigenous<br>studies also offer a bachelor of social<br>sciences<br>and i think the uh school of education<br>also does<br>so they're two three-year degrees<br>um and you'd come from there from high<br>school with good grades<br>because this is the main way you can<br>come in other ways i came in another way<br>to do my first degree i came in as a<br>slightly older student with not so good<br>grades<br>but you can come in with um and<br>start from high school um and<br>uh it would take you three years of<br>full-time study<br>to complete that degree assuming you<br>passed all your papers each year<br>and you would do each trimester<br>four papers that would be eight papers<br>a year the other um<br>the other two degrees that we have are<br>associated with<br>um social work and the bachelor of<br>environment and planning and they are<br>what we call<br>accredited degrees they take four years<br>to do<br>and those degrees are offered not just<br>by the university of waikato<br>but they're accredited by professional<br>organizations<br>for the bachelor of environment and<br>planning that's the association of<br>environment and planners<br>and for the um environmental business<br>and for the bachelor of social work<br>it is for the social work registration<br>board gives us recognition<br>so those are degrees that are<br>professional degrees<br>and if you pass this degree you can call<br>yourself a<br>environmental planner or you can call<br>yourself<br>a bachelor of social work they're both<br>very popular programs<br>they're both quite prestigious programs<br>and um<br>whereas the bachelor of arts and the<br>bachelor of social sciences are sort of<br>open degrees um there can be wait lists<br>and ranking um associated um to get into<br>the two accredited programs<br>there's a q a thing there i'm going to<br>what's the requirements for a masters in<br>social science and economics for<br>international students i'll come back to<br>that in a moment<br>i will return to that question um the<br>school of social sciences has<br>nine programs all up i think seven i<br>can't add<br>anthropology environmental planning<br>geography history philosophy political<br>science social policy<br>social work and sociology and two of<br>those<br>programs are teaching four-year<br>accredited papers<br>it's environmental planning and social<br>work<br>i am by training a sociologist one down<br>the bottom there<br>and um i completed my<br>studies at the university of canterbury<br>uh and then worked for 20 years at the<br>university of auckland before coming<br>down here<br>up here down here to be in which we have<br>the met to be the head of school<br>they we have quite a diverse range of<br>programs available to us we cover the<br>entire range of the social sciences<br>there are some sort of interesting<br>things about the way in which our school<br>of social sciences is formed because<br>if you look you'll see that history and<br>philosophy<br>are located here in the school of social<br>sciences and not in the school of arts<br>whereas the school of arts has a program<br>around screen and media<br>and they are also some quite interesting<br>things about the way in which<br>our degree structures and our study is<br>organized here<br>the philosophy program in the school of<br>social sciences is actually the largest<br>program that we have<br>and has um the most staff and the most<br>students enrolled in it which might be a<br>bit counter-intuitive<br>to you um the interesting thing about<br>philosophy at the school of social<br>science here at the university of<br>waikato is that<br>they really do do empirical and um so<br>and um experimental sort of research so<br>they're quite quite unusual<br>in the way in which they constitute<br>themselves q a<br>okay i'll deal with question two what<br>about psychology<br>i'm afraid you've come to the wrong<br>program there is a separate school of<br>psychology<br>so in this division so the schools<br>belong to a division<br>there are three schools the school of<br>social sciences<br>the school of arts and<br>the school of psychology and there's<br>also a research center<br>which is uh there for the study of<br>demographics<br>uh so no i don't do psychology vincent<br>reid is the chair of<br>uh psychology and i think he either had<br>the session before me in which case<br>you've missed him<br>or the session after me in which you've<br>got that to come<br>look forward to the next the first<br>question i had which i said i'd come<br>back to is<br>what's what are the requirements for<br>masters in social science and economics<br>for international students<br>it's a really specific question and i<br>think probably<br>you'd be better off approaching somebody<br>in our student center<br>for that we don't have economics as one<br>of our<br>programs um that's in the school of<br>management<br>primarily so the two questions so far<br>have been about economics and psychology<br>i can see who's here you could tell me<br>you can send me in your comments and<br>tell me where you're viewing me from<br>auckland well done what's it like under<br>lockdown whereabouts in auckland<br>um and from melbourne crikey they're<br>under lockdown as well<br>and brazil oh wow how exciting<br>um world's best football team after new<br>zealand of course<br>um so we have quite a few international<br>students here<br>so it might be worth talking about<br>uh people trying to study as<br>international students here in new<br>zealand<br>we do have the coronavirus<br>thing going on at the moment and it's<br>pretty much<br>impossible for a non-new zealand<br>resident or returning citizen<br>to get into new zealand at the moment<br>we're giving priority that the border is<br>largely closed<br>but there's been lots of talk in new<br>zealand as i saw<br>there has been across the whole of the<br>world about ways in which we could<br>create<br>safe spaces for students to start<br>traveling again<br>this university i think the university<br>of waikato has had<br>the best response uh to the lockdown in<br>new zealand<br>we went online as all the universities<br>did in new zealand in<br>the first lockdown back in march<br>but we really embraced that and so this<br>trimester well this semester depending<br>on which terminology use<br>we're making all of our courses still<br>available online so that if on monday we<br>discover that<br>the university has to go into online<br>teaching again because it's been closed<br>down<br>i think our university is going to be in<br>the best position<br>to be able to deal with that which i<br>mean we've been very cautious<br>our vice chancellor has emphasized the<br>safety of<br>uh our students our staff and our<br>community really above everything else<br>in the university<br>and i think we probably have been a<br>little bit more cautious than other<br>universities but<br>i think that we're in a pretty good<br>position uh as a result of that<br>so that's sort of like we anticipated<br>the worst and it<br>may have happened or not the worst but<br>we anticipated more problems than it may<br>yes you can do uh mj top<br>yes you can do um<br>uh maori and indigenous studies<br>a bachelor of social science through<br>them um<br>but of course with the school of social<br>sciences um so<br>they i'm not sure when their sessions on<br>but they<br>uh they have a special status uh what we<br>call them fmus<br>the faculty for maori and indigenous<br>studies they're the<br>only faculty left really everybody else<br>became either<br>became a school and those schools merged<br>into divisions<br>but because the treaty uh because of our<br>treaty commitments really and<br>the fact that the university of waikato<br>has a particularly close<br>um relationship with the tango to fenua<br>here<br>i think that reflects that uh the maori<br>indigenous studies here at waikato have<br>retained a sort of a<br>more autonomous position um they are the<br>building next door to us<br>um if you come to visit again they've<br>got some tremendously good staff<br>so actually so far all the questions i<br>know have come from places that are<br>under lockdown<br>hong kong is under lockdown auckland's<br>under lockdown east auckland is on<br>lockdown<br>we're not under lockdown yet but we may<br>is studying law as a major and political<br>science minor<br>a good combination yes i would say to<br>you<br>pretty much that it's always worth your<br>while to make that combination either a<br>double major if it's possible for you to<br>do<br>or a double minor you you may have to<br>spend a little bit more time<br>studying um i think the major minor you<br>just have to<br>have a more focused approach and the<br>workload might be slightly harder<br>heavier or more intensive but it's i<br>would say you get more bang for the buck<br>and it's a that's a really interesting<br>combination actually<br>um and uh i think that would be quite<br>good the political<br>um law here has just got a brand new hit<br>of school<br>and uh she's um doing a lot around<br>revitalizing that school not that it<br>needed revitalising i think it's<br>uh ranked one or two in terms of the<br>best law schools in new zealand<br>i thought i would recommend that<br>combination to you it's funny<br>i'm just checking through the other um<br>people that have chatted to me if<br>somebody could say whether they're<br>hearing all me that would be<br>awesome otherwise it'd be a bit<br>depressing to be talking to<br>nobody but i assume people send me<br>questions so that<br>is probably a good sign yes if you're if<br>you can hear me say<br>hi thank you very much<br>um so<br>just like every other university in new<br>zealand and i think most<br>in the world we're a little bit up in<br>the air<br>unclear about um<br>what we're going to be doing in terms of<br>international students next year<br>i think things can turn around very<br>quickly<br>but as i've said this year i took<br>there were 20 students in the people's<br>republic of china that couldn't get to<br>new zealand<br>they'd enrolled in the course and then<br>they'd enrolled in courses in<br>waikato in the school of social sciences<br>get the waterclothes before they can<br>make it out here so<br>new technologies that's why i'm so<br>awesome with the powerpoint<br>um but uh that was really successful<br>and we've had some pretty good feedback<br>about uh that online stuff<br>and really i'd say that it's been a game<br>changer<br>not just for this university but<br>probably from most universities in new<br>zealand<br>in terms of how staff now are going to<br>be delivering<br>their own their papers i think<br>increasingly we're going to see the use<br>of more and more resources<br>um that are digital resources even if<br>they're not for an online course<br>if you get what i mean i think it's<br>actually going to enrich that<br>it's been sort of forced upon us a<br>little bit but i think it's had some<br>pretty good results<br>so it must be quite difficult<br>for you to be planning what you want to<br>do next year<br>but i do want to be encouraging to you<br>and say that i think there are going to<br>be opportunities opening up<br>um there are vaccines on the way for<br>this coronavirus and who knows in<br>in six months or eight months or ten<br>months time this<br>to<br>here i'll give you some free<br>um are there any more questions<br>uh the master of social science the well<br>the master of social<br>sorry i just a question about uh did not<br>i have not spoken to about the master of<br>social science<br>i can't talk too much about the master<br>of social science and economics because<br>that's not a<br>subject that we offer but the master of<br>social science<br>is the extension if you like the<br>what comes after the bachelor of social<br>science so degrees are divided up into<br>undergraduate degrees and graduate<br>degrees<br>and the master of social sciences or<br>graduate degree my<br>i think you can do it in a number of<br>different ways<br>you can do it uh as a hundred and<br>as a hundred and eighty point paper<br>which means it takes three semesters or<br>18 months to do it<br>or you can do it as a two-year option or<br>you can do it after you've done<br>a fourth year of study as a one-year<br>fifth year of study so there's three<br>different ways that you can do it<br>so it can either be your fifth year of<br>study or your fourth in your fifth year<br>of study<br>depending on how you<br>um how you've enrolled in it<br>it depends now to get into any sort of<br>graduate paper you need to have a good<br>that's my cat's ear up there you need to<br>have a good<br>grade point average and you also need to<br>have that grade point average<br>uh relating to the topic that you're<br>doing and so if you<br>majored in history they probably<br>wouldn't let<br>you go oh we need to edit now question<br>time flight<br>okay so i'm very happy<br>even though some of you are asking<br>queries that aren't directly<br>i can't directly respond to because a<br>little bit outside my expertise<br>if you want to email me at just b curtis<br>b c u r t i s<br>b c u r t s at<br>waikato w-a-i-k-a-t-o<br>dot ac dot nz if you just send me an<br>email i'll respond to those in the next<br>couple of days<br>just between you and i okay<br>thank you very much it's been really</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We
