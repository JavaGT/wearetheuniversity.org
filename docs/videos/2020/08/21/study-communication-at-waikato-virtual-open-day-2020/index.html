studies<br>which is actually now known as the<br>bachelor of communication so<br>as i said my name is dylan i'm the head<br>of the school of management and<br>marketing in the waikato management<br>school here at the university of waikato<br>now is a really good time to be thinking<br>about studying communication<br>at the university of waikato because we<br>have just been through a fairly<br>extensive redevelopment of our<br>qualification so<br>the first part of that has been changing<br>the name of our bachelor of<br>communication studies or bcss<br>people have known it up until now and we<br>now have a degree called the bachelor of<br>communication<br>and so over the next 20 minutes i'm<br>going to be taking you through what<br>their qualification<br>uh now looks like and will look like<br>from next year<br>it is a far broader far more extensive<br>qualification it's very much<br>more up to date with the discipline and<br>also the careers that you're likely to<br>find yourself<br>looking at if you were to undertake a<br>bachelor of communication<br>so uh if you have any questions about<br>uh communication and the bachelor of<br>communication then there are people here<br>who can answer your questions so you can<br>just go online and<br>and type in your questions and you'll<br>get a an informative and educated<br>response<br>um in a very timely fashion i'm sure so<br>firstly why study communication the key<br>thing to note is that it doesn't matter<br>what you do<br>whatever career you end up in you're<br>going to need to know how to communicate<br>and communication skills are<br>increasingly important it's what we<br>often call<br>one of the the key or important soft<br>skills<br>that often really accomplish people have<br>and one example is often if you think of<br>some really<br>significant important and competent<br>leaders<br>often one of the characteristics that<br>they have is really good leadership<br>so good communication as part of their<br>leadership<br>and we're not just talking about verbal<br>or oral communication but also written<br>communication<br>and and that can be in a whole range of<br>different forms<br>so so when you when you think about<br>people who have been successful in their<br>careers<br>often you can see that communication has<br>been a key part of their success<br>and communication is a<br>multi-disciplinary<br>topic or discipline and that's certainly<br>how we have been developing the<br>qualification<br>for what we're going to be offering from<br>next year and so you can take<br>a bachelor of communication in a range<br>of different subjects or different<br>majors<br>and i'll take you through those briefly<br>in a moment<br>focusing specifically on the two majors<br>that have been<br>delivered through the waikato management<br>school for a number of years now<br>one of the important things to note<br>about communications in the waikato<br>management school<br>is we have some real leadership and some<br>real expertise<br>in that subject and so we have a number<br>of very<br>well known um well established experts<br>in communication uh not just<br>communication is a broader<br>discipline but also public relations and<br>marketing as well<br>we are very proud to have the<br>certification<br>from the public relations society of<br>america in fact there are only<br>10 institutions or 10 programs outside<br>of the usa<br>that have that certification and we're<br>very proud to be one of those we're the<br>only one<br>in new zealand indeed as well and<br>we're also very proud as a business<br>school or a management school to be<br>one of the top one per cent of business<br>schools globally to have triple crown<br>accreditation<br>so it's having accreditation with aacsb<br>um<br>equus or efmd and also amber which is<br>related to our executive education<br>programs<br>and so as i as i noted at the start of<br>my talk<br>we have recently revamped and expanded<br>our bachelor of communication<br>degree and so students that take this<br>and start on this next year will be the<br>first students to<br>be able to participate in this this new<br>and improved qualification<br>so i just wanted to touch on i guess<br>what our overall goals are<br>for the bachelor of communication and<br>what we hope our students our graduates<br>will take out of this<br>so one thing that's really important for<br>communication is to to have some core<br>theory<br>around communication embedded through<br>the qualification and we certainly have<br>that<br>but we also want to try and bring in<br>related disciplines<br>uh along the sides of that or to sort of<br>embed or cross through that so that<br>students can apply<br>core communication theory and practice<br>to their chosen<br>area of interest or focus and so that's<br>certainly what our qualification<br>and we also have a very strong practical<br>focus so<br>it's it's it's great and important to<br>understand the theory of communication<br>but you need to be able to apply that uh<br>to a career eventually<br>and so having a strong practical focus<br>within our qualification within the<br>papers that we teach<br>in that qualification is really<br>important<br>and so part of that is is having some<br>hands-on experience throughout the<br>program so<br>it's not simply a sit in class and and<br>watch or observe or listen to a lecturer<br>it is really much a hands-on and<br>experiential learning experience<br>for students doing the bachelor of<br>communication and as well as being<br>interdisciplinary it's<br>a truly interdisciplinary qualification<br>and<br>the core papers which i'll touch on in a<br>moment are delivered from<br>various parts of the university which<br>give that true interdisciplinary<br>feature and finally it's really<br>important in fact this is<br>common across all qualifications all<br>undergraduate degrees at this university<br>is that there is an intercultural<br>component to the bachelor of<br>communication so obviously we are a<br>bicultural country<br>but also we work in a global environment<br>uh and<br>even if we're just simply working in new<br>zealand so having an intercultural<br>paper and a cultural perspectives paper<br>in communication<br>is really important and so that has<br>found its way into our core<br>of that degree i'll just very quickly<br>touch on the structure of the bachelor<br>of communication<br>so the batch of communication is a<br>three-year degree there is an option for<br>doing a an honors year if you choose to<br>there are of course multiple pathways<br>into masters level study as well<br>so what you can see in front of you is<br>the the structure<br>of the degree and through the center of<br>of the the image you're looking at<br>is what we call the core so these are<br>the papers<br>we use the term papers rather than<br>courses these are the papers that all<br>students irrespective of their major<br>will take<br>so across the top the top row there are<br>four papers listed there<br>communication in a digital world which<br>reflects that the critical importance of<br>digital communication and so students<br>need to understand the role of<br>technology in in communication<br>communication competency is this<br>probably the core theory paper and<br>understanding<br>what communication is and what those<br>core theories are that need to be<br>applied<br>the fundamental skills for media and<br>creative industries<br>is a pathway into some of the more<br>creative<br>majors that can be taken now as part of<br>the new bachelor of communication<br>and communication and organizing is<br>really the business the management side<br>of communication<br>and so all students will take those in<br>their first year<br>into the second year we have two<br>compulsory core papers<br>one is communication ethics and that's<br>something which is particularly unique<br>to our<br>program here at the university of<br>waikato is that we want students<br>to be able to think very ethically about<br>how they carry up their ethic<br>their communication roles irrespective<br>whether that's public relations or<br>marketing or digital communication<br>they need to be able to in our mind be<br>able to behave and operate in an ethical<br>fashion<br>and also you'll see there in the second<br>year the paper intercultural<br>perspectives is showing<br>finally in the the third year so in the<br>third year it's very much focusing on on<br>the major<br>and also elective or minor papers but<br>certainly in the third year we want<br>students to sort of take away a more<br>capstone type experience a very<br>practical<br>experience and so there are some options<br>there whether that might be an<br>internship<br>uh it might be some sort of report of<br>investigation or maybe some sort of<br>consulting project<br>and so that is provided as an option for<br>students in that third year<br>you'll see on the left-hand side and the<br>sort of the yellowy orangey color<br>that is where uh the students or your<br>first major will be<br>and you have an option of across five<br>different first majors in the bachelor<br>of communication<br>and i'll talk through those in a moment<br>excuse me and so then also<br>on the right hand side you can see in<br>the blue color this is where you might<br>choose to<br>introduce a second major or you might<br>choose to have some elective papers<br>or also increasingly students are<br>thinking about how they might be able to<br>fit in<br>one or maybe even two minors to<br>supplement their their uh their major<br>subject and i'll talk just briefly<br>in a moment about what some of the uh<br>possible minors might be that would go<br>uh well with your first major so that's<br>overall what<br>the the degree structure looks like<br>so just to touch on on the majors and as<br>i said earlier<br>i'll spend a bit more time talking about<br>two of those majors the majors that are<br>delivered through the waikato management<br>school<br>so from next year you will be able to<br>take<br>one of five first majors and indeed you<br>may be able<br>or you may choose to take two of those<br>so you have applied digital<br>communication<br>which is very much focused on how on the<br>design excuse me and use of technology<br>and how that can be used to enhance uh<br>digital communication so looking at how<br>data can be embedded<br>uh in the the communication activities<br>that you undertake and<br>and you just need to go online and you<br>can see um some expertise being used or<br>applied<br>around uh digital communication creative<br>media is the most creative of our<br>uh our majors and this uh very much<br>focuses on sort of creative arts<br>knowledge and skills and how they can be<br>used and applied<br>in various creative roles media<br>production<br>uh is as it sounds and this we have a a<br>a suite on a i guess a video suite<br>on campus which allows you to apply some<br>of your production<br>skills so it's very much about the<br>production process around communication<br>and media<br>and then we have marketing and public<br>relations and i won't<br>say anything more about those now<br>because i'll provide a bit more detail<br>in a moment<br>um i've listed just there three minors<br>and these are probably the minors which<br>we're seeing uh taken a lot by students<br>that are taking the current bachelor of<br>communication so leadership<br>communication is a very<br>specialized communication set of papers<br>that can be<br>taken alongside often taken alongside<br>marketing or public relations<br>project management is an increasingly<br>popular<br>subject to study because it doesn't<br>matter what you do you'll have to be<br>able to<br>to work in the project environment work<br>carrying out projects and participating<br>in projects<br>and strategic management is a common<br>subject for many people to take<br>across a range of different areas on the<br>right-hand side you can see just<br>a small list of some of many<br>qualifications<br>so many careers that that that our<br>graduates often find themselves in now i<br>do want to touch on some of the more<br>well known alumni<br>from our bachelor of communication<br>studies and there is uh without doubt<br>our most<br>well-known alumni and that happens to be<br>our current prime minister<br>and you'll probably have heard people<br>talk about the communication skills that<br>jacinda ardern has<br>and there's no doubt that she has some<br>very strong communication skills and we<br>would like<br>i guess to claim some responsibility or<br>we've made some contribution to those<br>skills that she's developed<br>so she was someone we're very proud of<br>as being an alumni<br>of the university of waikato having<br>taken this degree<br>i'd just like to to touch very quickly<br>on two majors<br>so these are the two majors that are<br>delivered through the waikato management<br>school that i am sort of here<br>representing<br>and that is marketing and secondly i'll<br>talk about public relations<br>so alongside the redevelopment and the<br>upgrading<br>and the refreshing of the degree we have<br>also done been through a similar<br>exercise<br>uh looking to enhance and improve and<br>make more relevant the marketing major<br>and also the public relations major and<br>so i'm just showing you here<br>the structure of the marketing major and<br>there is a little bit of choice in this<br>and this is something which is really<br>appealing to students is they can have<br>the<br>have the opportunity now to sort of<br>focus or to specialize a little bit<br>and so the marketing major covers a<br>whole range of different<br>marketing topics and i just i just want<br>to specifically<br>draw your attention to in the second<br>year we specifically look at marketing<br>analytics and insights<br>and this is drawing on a lot of the<br>the marketing expertise and and skills<br>that we require these days<br>when working in a digital or online<br>environment<br>um and you'll see in the in the third<br>year there is also some choice there<br>so you can choose to look at more of a<br>professional selling approach and sales<br>is a big part of marketing but also we<br>have applied digital marketing<br>we look at social media marketing uh<br>content management<br>and also brand management so we've got<br>very much this is<br>the most up-to-date uh major in<br>marketing that you'll find<br>anywhere really because this is this is<br>hot off the press i guess<br>um moving across to public relations we<br>have also<br>uh undertaken a refresh of this and i<br>will note that this has been<br>uh undertaken with some external<br>involvement as well not just<br>external academics but also external<br>practitioners and i'll and i'll provide<br>some feedback<br>from them in a moment but again this one<br>has got some really contemporary topics<br>here in the public relations major<br>so you'll see on the bottom there if you<br>can see on the screen<br>corporate social responsibility and<br>social license is something which again<br>links back to to what i mentioned<br>earlier around our ethics around<br>communication<br>something we really want our graduates<br>to take away is having a real sense of<br>community sense i guess of what they do<br>there is some issues around issues and<br>crisis management in here which is<br>something which<br>is being applied a lot at the moment in<br>this covert 19 environment<br>and again there is some some<br>opportunities here for you to take<br>a second major or some minor subjects<br>which often go well with public<br>relations<br>so that just gives you a touch of i<br>guess<br>at the moment what are our two primary<br>majors but are<br>particularly popular across all of our<br>qualifications indeed<br>just want to just briefly note around<br>the student experience and<br>in particular around our bachelor of<br>communication it probably has one of the<br>largest and most<br>active social or student associations<br>of any association across the university<br>so a very active<br>management communication students<br>association<br>we've got some really proactive staff<br>here that manage that we also have a<br>number of students that<br>that maintain that that community and<br>and they invest heavily in that<br>and there's some really passionate<br>students more senior students that are<br>involved in that<br>and they meet regularly they bring in<br>industry experts and it's a really great<br>way to facilitate<br>students finding careers in their first<br>graduate job<br>so lots of connections with industry and<br>also a stepping stone to getting a<br>discounted<br>public relations of new zealand<br>membership as well if that's what<br>you ultimately end up wanting to do<br>so i i mentioned our most famous alumni<br>at the moment<br>but also here are a few others that that<br>you may<br>be familiar with so if you watch seven<br>sharp or<br>seen on other tv programs lucas de jong<br>is is one of our alumni<br>uh so he's currently at tvnz but has<br>also worked<br>for bbc world news in london and also<br>singapore<br>briar thompson uh actually did a bms<br>with<br>uh sorry a bcs with honours she was then<br>awarded a rhodes scholarship and went to<br>oxford university<br>and now currently works at the boston<br>consulting group in new york<br>and also jamie fitzgerald uh has had his<br>bcs degree for quite some time now but<br>he is a very well established and well<br>known<br>adventurer um so he has been to the<br>south island<br>south pole he's probably been to the<br>south island as well but he's certainly<br>been to the south pole<br>uh on his own he has i think he has<br>still has the world record<br>for crossing the uh atlantic ocean<br>growing<br>um and now he's a very successful<br>businessman and consultant<br>and strategist and so these are just<br>three examples of<br>um really quite notable i think alumni<br>i just wanted to provide a little bit of<br>um feedback from some of our alumni and<br>here are some that has come from two of<br>those<br>and so so brian just made this comment<br>here and<br>what we find is our alumni are always<br>very happy to<br>to talk about their experience and how<br>their qualification and study has helped<br>them in their careers and<br>in this case briar has talked about how<br>the bachelor of communication<br>helped her in preparing for her role at<br>the boston consulting group<br>and she's she made specific reference<br>here as you can see<br>about the role of the public relations<br>papers that she has taken<br>and lucas jejong here is just commenting<br>on the uh the flexibility<br>um and we do have a degree of<br>flexibility in our study here and how<br>he found that really beneficial to him<br>um<br>in part about how he can can study<br>across<br>not just management subjects but in his<br>case media studies and even social<br>sciences<br>now i mentioned about the industry<br>involvement<br>in the development or the redevelopment<br>of our bachelor of communication<br>and there are just some quotes here that<br>have come from some of some fairly<br>actually well-known<br>um industry experts who have reviewed<br>our new bachelor of communication and<br>these are some of the things that they<br>have said<br>uh about the degree that we will be<br>introducing next year<br>and so i guess to summarize what they're<br>saying is that they see it particularly<br>relevant to the changing nature of the<br>communication discipline in the<br>communication field<br>and so we're feeling really confident<br>with the support of industry that we<br>now have a qualification that prepares<br>students as well as we possibly can for<br>an industry which has gone through a<br>period of change is now heavily<br>influenced by digital technologies<br>and so it's a qualification that we are<br>particularly proud of<br>so i hope that you've found what i have<br>uh covered over the last 20 minutes<br>to be of of interest to you i hope that<br>you have learned some some things about<br>our<br>our degree and where it's going if you<br>have any questions then<br>as i said before there are people who<br>can answer your questions through the q<br>a but hopefully you found that<br>informative and i look forward to seeing</p></main><footer
