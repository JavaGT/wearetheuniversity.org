Would you like to start your studies early? Do you want to make Uni friends and boost your study skills? Join our Jumpstart programme and get started with your degree earlier!<br><br>You can take the 1st paper in your degree and get set-up for the rest of your studies; find your way around campus, and make Uni friends all before the end of summer. There will be several 100-level (15 point) papers you can choose from. These papers will suit any new student, but particularly those who have lower NCEA credits (or equivalent) in core areas such as literacy, maths, and science.<br><br>This programme is also great for those who would like to make friends and ease into understanding the Uni environment and learn core Uni study skills. Alongside the paper you choose, you will attend sessions teaching you important tertiary study skills, how to use the Uni technology and so much more - all aimed at helping you be successful at University.<br><br>Find out more about Jumpstart here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/campaigns/jump-start/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i decided to join jumpstart because<br>i'm in my later 20s and i wanted to<br>have a start to study before the<br>semester a began<br>i also am studying teaching and an<br>elective<br>that was in the teaching paper was the<br>right 100 paper<br>so because i found study quite<br>challenging as well i wanted to get a<br>head start and get in the routine before<br>the semester began it wasn't actually my<br>choice to join jumpstart it was my mum's<br>decision<br>initially i thought i'd be better off<br>just coming straight into uni<br>and now that i've done jumpstart<br>i see how wrong i would have been so<br>that's the reason why i joined jumpstart<br>english is not my first language<br>exactly i feel a little bit struggle<br>with my language when i doing<br>my work in my high school so i think<br>it's the best way to start with an<br>earlier course that i could improve<br>my some skill like writing<br>one of the top things i got out of<br>jumpstart was building relationship with<br>the group of people that were<br>assigned to the right 101 paper we also<br>got to know<br>others in the jump start program and<br>other staff members<br>and different areas of the uni and i<br>think that's really important<br>transitioning into such a big<br>environment there were people from lots<br>of different cultures and backgrounds<br>and also some people that voiced about<br>anxiety<br>and building this familiarity and<br>routine<br>really helped with preparing<br>students for the unknowns because it<br>became more familiar<br>and it enabled me to enjoy o-week more<br>because<br>i was able to understand how the<br>university worked and if i missed<br>one of the o-week seminars i wasn't too<br>worried because i<br>had already started a routine and that<br>really helped with semester a<br>top things i got out of jumpstart will<br>probably be meeting new people<br>also getting a lot out of the campus<br>before you get into your hectic<br>a semester and just being comfortable<br>around<br>not being at home because i took part in<br>which is writing a hundred that teach me<br>some academic writing skills for the<br>university is safe i think it's<br>different from the thing<br>i had learned when i at high school that<br>jumpstart has laid a foundation so<br>the study tips time management<br>meeting different staff getting to know<br>familiar faces<br>built a really strong foundation for me<br>for when<br>things outside of uni happened lots of<br>pressures outside of uni<br>which put a lot of extra pressure on<br>study this term<br>and i honestly am not i'm not sure if i<br>would have<br>completed the semester without having<br>those tips and understandings before<br>starting<br>it's helped me cope well with pressure<br>when studying jumpstart actually exposed<br>me to all the<br>helpful resources on campus whether it<br>be the tutors<br>the library resources everything like<br>that we learned<br>prior to orientation week and that made<br>everything a lot less stressful<br>jumpstart saved me plenty of times<br>compared with the students who didn't<br>take us in this course<br>they probably had to spend much more<br>extra time<br>on their study<br>so some advice for starting university<br>would be when you look at assignments<br>just remember that they're made up of<br>lots of little steps<br>such as readings and referencing and<br>start really helps covers those little<br>cover those little steps so if you don't<br>do jump starts still<br>be willing to ask for help and lean on<br>student learning and other support<br>services available because<br>they're so willing to help break down<br>those assignments<br>so that they're more manageable and<br>achievable if you are the person who<br>looking for some personal<br>improvement it's a good place you can<br>start with my advice will be<br>don't be scared to take the leap um<br>transitioning<br>coming into uni life is not easy<br>everybody's been there<br>and it all gets better through time and<br>trust me<br>it's worth the while coming to uni and<br>especially doing jumpstart</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
