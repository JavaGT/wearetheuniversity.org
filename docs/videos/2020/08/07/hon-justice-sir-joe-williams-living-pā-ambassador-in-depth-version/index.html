Justice Sir Joe Williams speaks about the transformational potential of the Living Pā and what it means to how we teach and learn, how we confront the problems we face, and how we can think holistically about knowledge.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i was a first-year student here when the<br>marai<br>the heading of waka as it came to be<br>called was first established at 36<br>kelvin parade<br>just in afari just in one of the houses<br>along melbourne parade<br>it was then a radical idea the idea that<br>you'd have a maori space with<br>maori symbols everywhere and the maori<br>students would come together<br>and then that became the current the<br>heading of<br>this big institutional marae that we're<br>sitting in now<br>the 1980s for me<br>were transformational<br>in many ways and this marae the waka<br>was the kind of centerpiece of that<br>transformation because we were coming<br>out of a time when<br>um actually being maori wasn't that cool<br>it was a deficit and for<br>to walk into a world in which being<br>maori was<br>positive and strong and full of mana<br>full of deep wisdom and philosophy<br>all of those things was to walk into a<br>place where suddenly the way you felt<br>made sense for the first time for many<br>so it's just<br>impossible to overstate the impact of<br>this place<br>on my generation of students i expect<br>each generation will say that<br>but for us as the first generation on<br>the streets<br>calling for you know the maori language<br>to be recognized calling for mana<br>motuhake<br>calling for the mana of the treaty we<br>recognized<br>these were the times where<br>you know aotearoa grew up at the same<br>time we were growing up<br>and there were there was a lot of<br>tension<br>a lot of difficulties a lot of roy mata<br>but<br>hard to overstate the<br>great contribution this made<br>to who i am and who my generation<br>that came here are now<br>knowledge is one thing but wisdom is a<br>thousand times more powerful<br>and a living power provides the best<br>opportunity<br>for the construction not of knowledge<br>but of wisdom<br>the idea that you would have a<br>sustainable multi-disciplinary<br>center for learning and teaching<br>inevitably means a radical rethink<br>about how you teach and how you learn<br>you know we are fragmented disconnected<br>and we are individually increasingly<br>expert more and more about less and less<br>and the living part i think is an<br>attempt to reverse that<br>so that we tear down the silos and think<br>holistically<br>about the problems we confront problems<br>of the planet problems of cultural<br>survival<br>this is a whole new way of teaching and<br>learning right that's the best thing<br>about it<br>but the building is the platform for<br>rethinking the way we<br>actually teach and learn this opens your<br>minds up to<br>finding that the real lecture theaters<br>are out there<br>and this seems to me to be a kind of<br>radical extension<br>of that idea the living not just a fare<br>and a farakai but<br>as a teaching and learning space that's<br>something we would never have thought<br>thought about in 1980 i don't think<br>but when i heard about it i thought<br>this is an idea worth me and others<br>putting our backs into<br>the heading of victoria university<br>wellington<br>is not kelvin parade and the town campus<br>and whatever else it's altera<br>and that we need to supplement whatever<br>academic we learning we have in these<br>places<br>with the wisdom out in the community not<br>just the maori community but the wider<br>community<br>so in a way it seems to me the living<br>power<br>is a kind of metaphor for the idea that<br>the lecture theaters<br>for victoria university of wellington<br>are te kara maawi tewai ponamu<br>farekawi rakiura metimoananuyakiwa<br>you know the north island the south<br>island the chathams stewart island<br>and the pacific those are our true<br>lecture theaters<br>and that applies whether you're talking<br>about literature<br>law philosophy science culture<br>language the same idea applies<br>now if you can activate that idea<br>you fundamentally change the way we<br>humans<br>think about education and i think if<br>if this institution succeeds in doing<br>that<br>the world is going to follow because<br>it's a radical and good idea<br>exactly right for our times this is not<br>just a change for the university or its<br>students<br>it's a change for the university<br>students<br>and the community the<br>impact of the living power<br>is i think going to be beyond the<br>edifice<br>itself and what it stands for<br>which in itself is a kind of a teacher<br>you know the edifice is a teacher<br>it will be beyond the institution of the<br>university<br>and it will affect the university by the<br>way that it<br>comes to view itself as a higher<br>learning institution<br>it's going to affect the teachers<br>because they're going to have to rethink<br>how they teach it's going to affect all<br>the students because they're going to<br>have to rethink how they learn<br>in a more connected interconnected and<br>dynamic way i think<br>but i think you know most importantly<br>are two impacts one<br>is the impact on the wider community<br>that the university has finally to<br>become a part of<br>in order for this idea to work<br>and secondly i think a powerful impact<br>will be on the idea<br>of higher learning and higher teaching<br>not just in wellington or even in<br>aotearoa<br>this could have a worldwide effect<br>you know if you agree<br>as i do it becomes our responsibility to<br>support it<br>this is not just a matter of giving<br>money because it's a nice idea<br>this is about giving practical support<br>to an idea whose time has come and must<br>be supported if it's going to work<br>everybody who can should reach into<br>their pockets because we are<br>talking about a transformational<br>model for what we do in which we<br>take from the old we take from the maori<br>we take from the empirical and rational<br>world<br>and all of the other areas of learning<br>and we mash them up<br>and produce what i think<br>will be genuine wisdom and insight<br>that<br>oh</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
