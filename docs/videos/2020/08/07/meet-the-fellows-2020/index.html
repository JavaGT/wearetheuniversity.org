an artist<br>so john you're at the end so i'm going<br>to just<br>throw it to you where you've where<br>you've come from and<br>how you do it okay i'll do my best um<br>thank you all for coming out on this<br>lovely sunny afternoon<br>um i i knew decided that i was going to<br>be a poet at a very<br>ridiculously young age i was about 14<br>years old i remember the moment quite<br>vividly<br>and um so you know and that's i've sort<br>of always<br>stuck to that um to that<br>you know that's always been my my<br>preferred uh preferred course ever since<br>except that i seem to have spent all my<br>adult life<br>sort of stepping in and out of the<br>university and trying to decide whether<br>or not the university was actually a<br>place i wanted to be<br>and a place that was going to help me do<br>the things that i wanted to do<br>creatively so<br>when i first left school i went to<br>university for about three months and<br>then dropped out and went off<br>to australia to be a poet and then a<br>couple of years later i came back and<br>did a ba<br>and then went off for a couple of years<br>to be a poet and then i got<br>sick of that and i um well you know<br>i changed you know i had that one of my<br>periodic changes at heart where i<br>thought actually no<br>a bit more a bit more you know tertiary<br>education will<br>will help and perhaps a job and the<br>university would help um and so i went<br>back<br>and<br>a phd in melbourne and got an academic<br>job and i spent about 15 years<br>um working uh at mainland canterbury<br>university<br>uh and you know along the way i managed<br>to write<br>produce one book of poetry and then<br>found myself<br>really struggling to produce any more<br>during the time that i was i was<br>teaching at canterbury and eventually i<br>decided that it was<br>it was now or never if i wasn't going to<br>get completely sort of swallowed up by<br>my academic work and i<br>left my university job in about 2010 and<br>ever since then i have been<br>you know what i call somewhat ironically<br>a full-time<br>writer i sometimes even call myself a<br>self-supporting writer or<br>an independent scholar which is a bit of<br>a joke because<br>i've really sustained that that position<br>by largely on the back of a series of<br>so that's been that's been that's been<br>the sort of material part of the journey<br>but along the way i've you know what's<br>gone along with that is a sort of<br>vacillation between<br>uh writing you know creative work<br>predominantly predominantly poetry and<br>doing scholarly work<br>and so um funnily enough even uh<br>you know i'm here on a creative<br>fellowship but actually what i'm going<br>to be doing this year<br>is a work of a work of literary history<br>um<br>the the second volume of a<br>three volume history of new zealand<br>writing from basically the beginning of<br>the 20th century to the middle to the<br>mid-1980s<br>i've got stage prop here which is the<br>first<br>the first one which came out in 2017 a<br>book called hard frost which went up to<br>1945.<br>um what i'm going to be doing this year<br>at uh on this um<br>is burnsville what i'm working on is a<br>second volume which covers the<br>the the 50s and the 60s really the sort<br>of charles brash era of lame fall<br>so i think it's 46 to 66 is the period<br>i've<br>um i've bitten off uh which is a lovely<br>thing to be doing here in<br>dunedin and in um and on on this um<br>this you know this fellowship which was<br>um<br>by you know perhaps not explicitly but<br>um but in every practical sense i'm<br>actually<br>endowed by charles brash himself so it's<br>a it's a very nice place to be doing it<br>and yeah and uh here i am<br>thank you thank you john christie yes<br>um hi everyone and so i have been a<br>student the last 10 years<br>and i grew up in blenheim and i've<br>always danced in a studio setting and by<br>the time i was 15<br>my teacher was training me to teach<br>dance so i started teaching young people<br>and that became<br>my passion quite quickly so i ended up<br>moving to auckland<br>um to study dance at the university of<br>auckland and i stayed there i did my<br>bachelor of dance studies<br>through my postgraduate diploma and<br>creative performing arts then my masters<br>in dance studies<br>which is where i started exploring dance<br>and prisons which is what i'm doing for<br>my fellowship the caroline plummer<br>fellowship<br>um and then continued with my phd in<br>dance studies which i have<br>finished perfectly timed for at the end<br>of february and then moved to dunedin<br>the week after the fellowship<br>um so i've yeah largely been a student<br>or work that publishing articles going<br>to conferences kind of involved in the<br>academia side of dance<br>but always keep the connected to and<br>facilitating dance in the community<br>and one of my passion projects is a<br>holiday program that i run through<br>council funding<br>um to provide dance to well-income<br>families and making dance affordable<br>because dance itself can be quite<br>expensive so<br>i try and yeah i really enjoy providing<br>dance to people where dance may not<br>already exist<br>and i guess that's kind of what i'm<br>continuing through my fellowship as well<br>and yeah my career is still going and<br>it's really just starting<br>yeah yeah so i can't speak too much more<br>um i've lectured in the dance<br>department i guess over the five years<br>while i was studying and lots of little<br>bits and pieces everywhere i guess lots<br>of<br>part-time jobs alongside my studies<br>yes thank you christine<br>elena your career to date and your<br>journey as an artist<br>thank you i'm just picking up on a<br>couple of things um<br>john john said he's mainly sort of made<br>a living out of writing um<br>through fellowships and things like that<br>well this is the first<br>time ever i'm having this fellowship<br>that i've ever<br>supported myself as a writer so it's<br>very very special to me<br>um and also a friend of mine said when i<br>was awarded the fellowship she said oh<br>that's lovely elena it's such a nice<br>note to retire on<br>and i thought no this is just the start<br>of my writing<br>journey that's a nice thing about being<br>a writer<br>not only is it portable and you can take<br>it with you anywhere but<br>you can also keep writing until<br>as long as you like really as long as<br>you're able to<br>anyway just to go back a little bit<br>i think my mother was a writer and a<br>poet but not a published<br>writer or poet but she always used to<br>read me her poems before i went to sleep<br>at night and<br>i think that's probably the start of my<br>writing journey<br>when i was about three years old i made<br>up a little poem in bed one night and<br>she sent it off to the christ church<br>priests or christchurch star because we<br>were living in christchurch then and it<br>was published and<br>it consisted of one one word repeated<br>over and over again because i like the<br>sound of it<br>and then um just from there i you know i<br>liked<br>writing in english at school when i left<br>school<br>i i just i couldn't i think if there'd<br>been a course in<br>you know sort of creative writing back<br>then i would have done that but there<br>weren't so i did a ba in english<br>and then couldn't see any way to make a<br>career out of<br>writing in fact i probably didn't even<br>really think about it seriously i went<br>on and became a librarian which i loved<br>and it wasn't until i had children of my<br>own and a friend of mine<br>did a short children's writing course<br>and said come along eleanor<br>with me and i did and that that was what<br>got me started on writing for children<br>um i think that's when i realized<br>that my inner writer is probably<br>probably around<br>eight years old and that was that was a<br>reason i've never<br>really had the drive to write before<br>that until i realized that i actually it<br>was writing for children that i wanted<br>to do<br>um my true love is writing children's<br>poetry<br>um but i've never really<br>been able to settle on a on a genre if<br>you like it's not really a genre but<br>i've tried picture books because they<br>were<br>tried them to start with because they<br>were short and then i<br>sort of tried writing early readers<br>and junior chapter books<br>and then i did a sort of a middle grade<br>novel<br>intermediate age novel um and i think<br>that's about as<br>that's about as grown up as i am<br>probably going to get<br>but below that i haven't quite decided<br>which area<br>i'm going to settle and i might just be<br>a generalist<br>but yeah basically i just after i did<br>the children's writing course i just<br>sent all sorts of really really bad<br>manuscripts after publishers got about<br>200 rejections<br>i feel really sorry for the publishers<br>now<br>and then eventually i was published by<br>walker books<br>and i had four books published by them<br>and then there was a bit of a<br>lull in my writing career because around<br>2014 the publishing industry sort of<br>went a bit<br>pear shaped and then i went back<br>a few years ago i did my master's in<br>creative writing<br>and that really sort of sort of got the<br>creative<br>got my writing mojo back again and then<br>i got off at this<br>fellowship which was just amazing and<br>i'm doing a combination of two things<br>for the fellowship i'm doing<br>a project which i want to do but i'm<br>finding hard to make myself do because<br>it's it's prose and that's another<br>middle grade<br>children's fantasy novel based in the<br>world of a bill hammond<br>bird people painting and then i'm doing<br>some children's poems<br>um as well which i have no trouble<br>making myself<br>do but i think that brings you up to<br>date<br>yeah are we allowed to ask what the poem<br>was that was published in the cartridge<br>paper<br>it was just called venetian because i<br>had venetian blinds in my room and i<br>really like the sound of the name the<br>nation<br>and the nation the nation the nation the<br>nation the nation the nation the nation<br>the nation of the nation the nation<br>nation the nation the nation the nation<br>your career to date and your journey as<br>an artist in<br>um well i started off in the brass band<br>movement my father was a<br>corner player in the car comparison band<br>and we moved to christchurch when i was<br>still a<br>wee baby so i grew up in the brass band<br>movement really<br>my love of classical music started when<br>i was at high school i had a very good<br>music teacher there<br>and i also met a friend who was already<br>playing in the christchurch symphony<br>orchestra so he introduced me to all<br>sorts of things that i've never heard<br>before<br>and one other thing happened in that i<br>had a jazz piano teacher in christchurch<br>by the name of bob bradford<br>and i can remember going to his studio<br>one day and he was playing something<br>which<br>had jazzy chords but wasn't jazz and it<br>was a piece by twitch composer claude to<br>called the sudden cathedral and i was<br>blown away i was thinking i was 15<br>maybe 16 and i'd never heard anything<br>like it and i<br>asked him to play it again and that was<br>that was what<br>flipped things that was the pivotal<br>moment i just was fascinated by the<br>whole compositional process at that<br>point it's like how do you think i'm<br>such a dreamly<br>dreamy beautiful music like that how do<br>you do it so the whole process<br>started to fascinate me so that's when i<br>started doodling at the piano and<br>writing my own silly little eye<br>pieces but that was start of a real<br>journey for me from that point i would<br>say<br>i started on the corner as i i kept<br>getting bigger instruments in my hand<br>like euphonium and i've only ended up on<br>the tube because i seem to make a better<br>sound on that than any other instrument<br>and was lucky enough to get the job in<br>the nz so at the age of 20.<br>so i spent 25 years in the internet so i<br>was the tuba player<br>and because you don't have to do that<br>much as a cheaper player<br>a lot of pieces you get off i was able<br>to pursue my other passions of writing<br>and conducting<br>i had plenty of time to go and do the<br>odd gig as conductor and i had plenty of<br>time to stay at home<br>when i wasn't required for the orchestra<br>and do some writing<br>so those things basically snowballed<br>over the next few years to the point<br>where i was<br>made i started conducting seriously i<br>suppose professionally in the mid-80s<br>um incidence so maybe the conductor in<br>residence in 1991<br>i think i then was starting by the end<br>of the 90s was starting to get<br>more work in australia new zealand than<br>i could get leave for from the orchestra<br>so i left the orchestra in 2001 and took<br>the step of just<br>embarking on a freelance composing and<br>conducting<br>life at the same time i was i had been<br>teaching at the university of<br>victoria new zealand school of music as<br>it's now known<br>um i started off as a brass cheated<br>there in the 80s and 90s but<br>come the 2000s i found myself being<br>asked to do<br>composition lectures and teaching<br>conducting which had never been done<br>there before<br>um and because i'd had a rather good<br>teacher by the name of dobbs franks<br>in nicholas knows very well who taught<br>me a wonderful technique which<br>would pass on to my students seems to<br>work rather well<br>so then cut forward to<br>last year i've done 35 years or so at<br>the school of music and i decided it was<br>my personal circumstances changed and i<br>figured it was time for<br>a break and a change in my life<br>um the pull of the south was big because<br>i bought an invercargill<br>my ancestors came into port otago in<br>1862 all the way from scotland<br>the pool south has been huge for me for<br>a long time central otago is my favorite<br>part of the country<br>i grew up in christchurch so the south<br>island i've missed having lived in<br>wellington for 43 years<br>um so i decided to move to need having<br>decided to move to dunedin and retire<br>from university work a former student<br>actually encouraged me to apply for the<br>fellowship<br>and i naively thought that i wasn't<br>eligible because i thought it was<br>for graduates of bataga university but<br>that's not the case<br>so i applied and was really fortunate<br>enough to be offered the fellowship and<br>so it was like this wonderful bonus i<br>was moving to neden anyway and i to do<br>the fellowship<br>so i've felt very fortunate during this<br>whole covert experience<br>to be lucky enough to have a wee house<br>to live in soyuz bay and just right<br>and what i'm writing is a an opera um i<br>wrote an oprah which was<br>performed last year in auckland and so i<br>got the bug from that really so<br>all i can say is that it's based around<br>janet frank<br>no it's any more than that it's for a<br>very fine local soprano who i admire<br>very much<br>and uh don't worry janet frame's not<br>gonna be standing there with large<br>orange hair screaming at the top of her<br>lungs it's not<br>it's not quite like that it's a little<br>bit more complex but i'm really enjoying<br>this and i'm going to be also writing a<br>song cycle<br>for another local metro soprano as well<br>so loving dunedin loving working here<br>and just really grateful for this<br>opportunity<br>thank you beautiful thank you well thank<br>you all that's very interesting and<br>there's a<br>there's a commonality and a uniqueness<br>about each of your stories<br>i'd like to ask you about um<br>your creative process the process the<br>inspiration and the methodology<br>of how you actually work that whole<br>sense of the<br>empty canvas where you start and when<br>you how you get on<br>so i'll just throw that to anybody who<br>wants to start rather than doing it in a<br>little straight line<br>creative process inspiration and<br>methodology<br>of your work helena<br>nobody was offering to come forward so<br>well you know we mere mortals um um<br>i think it's it's it's you know it's a<br>conundrum as to<br>what you do how it happens does it come<br>just simply<br>i watched amadeus last night off from<br>the national theater in london<br>and um salieri got really pissed off<br>basically that<br>that he saw an original manuscript page<br>suspection but it's based on fact of<br>something that mozart had written<br>and it was written out the first copy of<br>it was written out<br>perfectly there was no there was no<br>corrections there was no<br>i don't like that that note i'll change<br>that one<br>it came out perfectly onto a page the<br>whole thing perfectly formed<br>now that's pretty<br>genius but the whole i'm basically<br>asking you what's your creative process<br>but actually that's kind of what my<br>creative process is like that<br>some people have lots and lots of ideas<br>in their head<br>all the time and they just can't decide<br>which one they want to focus on<br>i usually have no ideas in my head it's<br>a blank<br>canvas until some little thing sparks an<br>idea it's often often it's when i'm<br>actually<br>sitting down and trying to write that<br>the ideas come to me<br>or it might it might just come out of<br>almost out of nowhere but it's usually<br>something that triggers it<br>like my first book the rain train is a<br>picture book but it's<br>really a poem and<br>the idea for that i realized later<br>had been seated a long time ago so it's<br>about the journey of a<br>train through a stormy night and it<br>combines the sounds of<br>the sounds of the train and the sounds<br>of the rain and<br>when i was younger i found it difficult<br>to get to sleep that night and i used to<br>only on nights when it was rainy and<br>stormy but i get to sleep really easily<br>and also when i was on a we often made<br>long journeys<br>on the train overnight train between<br>auckland and um<br>well we actually went via palms to north<br>dakotan but i digress<br>but they were overnight journeys and<br>then i'd sleep really well on the train<br>and i thought how wonderful it would be<br>if you could combine<br>somehow and um while you were going to<br>sleep the sounds of the rain and this or<br>the movement of a train<br>um the sounds yeah and um then one<br>i list i went to a um so that you've<br>been sitting there for a while<br>but obviously i didn't become a you know<br>furniture manufacturer or something like<br>that so it wasn't going to translate<br>into a bed that<br>could do that but when i was a writer i<br>thought oh i could make a poem<br>about that and i went to a<br>talk that sally sutton did where she<br>read her book um her picture book road<br>works<br>and that was the story of a journey of a<br>road and i thought oh<br>actually you could write a picture book<br>that was<br>that he was just a kind of a journey<br>rather than having the normal story arc<br>and then one night when it was really<br>rainy<br>um suddenly the idea came to me and it<br>was very magical and i sat down<br>sort of when all the children were in<br>bed about eleven o'clock at night and i<br>sat down until two or three in the<br>morning and i just wrote it in one go so<br>that was<br>that was that's the only the only thing<br>i've written that's been really magical<br>like that that's just kind of come out<br>in one piece um<br>often it's a matter of just um<br>sitting down and picking combining ideas<br>um i think for for pros<br>i read somewhere that you need three<br>good ideas so often i'll have one idea<br>that i really like<br>um like with the name at the end of the<br>latter it was<br>this thought that what what would a will<br>be like<br>if you could choose your own name and<br>then that name<br>affected the way affected your<br>personality<br>the meaning of the name affected your<br>personality the way you looked the way<br>you acted<br>um and what kind of world would that<br>be and then i realized that wasn't<br>that was just a situation that wasn't<br>quite enough for a story and then i sort<br>of combined it<br>suddenly came to me i could combine it<br>with the idea of<br>perhaps the snakes and ladders game<br>because when i read<br>um alice in wonderland when i was little<br>i'd loved the<br>you know the alice and they actually<br>there is through the looking glass um<br>part of it where it had all been set in<br>a chess game so<br>that's just also something from my past<br>coming back things that i'd loved<br>reading about and then i just combined<br>the two but then<br>the actual process of writing it was<br>really hard it was like<br>i just to make myself sit down and write<br>a chapter and<br>yeah often find writing prose is a bit<br>like<br>pulling out teeth and unless i have a<br>deadline<br>i'm really bad but once i have a<br>deadline i i sort of work to that<br>deadline<br>whereas poetry seems to come from a<br>different part of my head<br>and that i'm always happy to sort of<br>play with words and write poetry<br>and uh and i don't have to force myself<br>to do that but i want to do i want to do<br>both<br>yeah do you find the subconscious plays<br>a big role what you do uh yeah<br>definitely i often<br>find that i um if i'm nutting something<br>out and i can't think of the answer i've<br>got into a little plot hole or i can't<br>think of the next line that's going to<br>sort of<br>if i'm doing it in rhyme that's going to<br>work and rhyme i'll just go to sleep uh<br>thinking about it um and then when i<br>wake up in the morning<br>um yeah the uh the answer is there or<br>yeah or walking is really good i don't<br>know if you found that too<br>like the rhythm of walking seems to get<br>your um<br>you know sort of creative juices going<br>or being in the shower with the<br>oh um it's a two-fold thing for me<br>because the majority<br>the vast majority of the music that i've<br>written over the years it's either been<br>for a particular ensemble or particular<br>soloist or particular instrumentalist so<br>you have those persons<br>strengths weaknesses whatever talents in<br>mind when you're writing<br>or you're writing for a particular<br>orchestra so if i was to writing a piece<br>for a chamber orchestrator<br>of amateur quality um i perhaps wouldn't<br>place the technical demands on them if i<br>was writing a piece for<br>these itself something like that so it's<br>two folder that you have to take into<br>account the practicalities<br>having addressed that you think well i'd<br>like to actually do this<br>i don't necessarily sit down and think<br>what i've found is that if you try and<br>write something angsty<br>it won't come through if you try and<br>write something lush and beautiful it's<br>not necessarily going to be the case<br>i think the more you try and do<br>something the further away you get from<br>it<br>without wishing to sound overly esoteric<br>i'm a great believer in what<br>i just asked eleanor about the<br>subconscious i find that<br>uh when i get to the end of having<br>written a piece quite often i'm<br>surprised by what i see<br>and certainly when i hear it it's like<br>well where did that come from and you<br>realize that there are other forces at<br>work and you can call it what you like<br>doesn't really matter to me um but i<br>know i'm not alone in the creative<br>process<br>i know i've over the last 45 years cree<br>is sort of honed a craft which i can use<br>to formulate a work<br>which is is technically<br>correct well written but that<br>a lot of the material has come from<br>somewhere else<br>and i think that's just basically the<br>right brain<br>i can tell you a wee story about that my<br>ex-wife started doing<br>um watercolor lessons she'd never done<br>painting in her life<br>and after only six weeks she brought<br>home this little canvas of<br>some tamarillos which she painted which<br>you could have plucked them off the<br>canvas they were<br>beautiful i wanted to eat them i said<br>how did you do that i said you know<br>she said well we've got sort of<br>basically shown how<br>to get in touch with our right brain<br>creative side of our brain<br>and she said i don't remember doing most<br>of this and i'm thinking oh<br>okay so i sort of investigated that<br>quite a bit and<br>really it is it's extraordinary what<br>comes through if you just allow if<br>you're open to it<br>whereas i know a lot of composers like<br>that<br>it doesn't have to be that way i start<br>with a note and then<br>the piano do some other things and stuff<br>comes through<br>and you work at what comes through and<br>you craft that<br>it's like being given a piece of of clay<br>if you're a sculptor<br>here's the clay it's really good clay<br>though<br>now you have now you're going to<br>formulate something with that it's sort<br>of aligned with that sort of thought<br>really so<br>it's it's a lot of hard work and you do<br>have to have the craft and because i<br>played an orchestra i learned a lot<br>about how to write for orchestra so it's<br>my favorite medium<br>my favorite genre if you like um so i<br>instinctively have this what i call my<br>catalogue of sounds<br>which i consider i want it to sound like<br>this no i need a flute playing there and<br>i need the clarinet to color that a<br>little bit so that sort of thing comes<br>easily to me because of my background<br>um form wise and actual craft wise i've<br>learned a lot by studying the work of<br>other composers because i'm a conductor<br>so one thing informs the other my work<br>as a conductor informs the work as a<br>composer and vice versa so i've been<br>very fortunate<br>but i'm a very great believer in the<br>fact that<br>we're not alone and our creative<br>endeavors<br>lovely um i had some i wanted to pick up<br>on the<br>thing that you said beginning around<br>keeping in mind the people that you're<br>working with<br>um and that's a really big part of my<br>process with it being community dances<br>and i'll be creating both for and with<br>the people that i'm working with<br>and and so thinking explicitly with the<br>prison environment that i'm going into<br>and working with male prisoners<br>and on my very first class there are a<br>lot of unknowns<br>i didn't know how many people they were<br>going to be i didn't know what age they<br>were going to be how they were going to<br>respond all i knew was that they were<br>going to be hopefully males that turn up<br>to do a dance class<br>in a prison um so before i even started<br>planning what i was doing that i had to<br>do i<br>did a bit like quite a lot of reading<br>and talking to people to kind of see<br>what's worked before what advice can i<br>get from others who are already working<br>in that environment<br>and i came up with a plan of what i<br>wanted to do and discussed it with the<br>prison staff and then<br>i had to be ready to adapt it once i was<br>in there and actually working with them<br>and actually<br>provide a space for them where they feel<br>comfortable to share what they would<br>like to do and how they felt it wasn't<br>and constantly adapt<br>the way that i approach the classes that<br>i'm teaching each week<br>and yes and but in saying that the<br>content that i'm teaching with them<br>could also be very similar to content<br>i'm teaching with other people<br>outside of prisons um but i've always<br>got that in mind of who i'm working with<br>and<br>and what is it that they would like to<br>do what is it that they would like to<br>achieve from it and how can i tailor my<br>content<br>both in the moment as i'm teaching in<br>the classes but from week to week<br>um and yet there's been probably as much<br>as a learning curve for myself as it has<br>been for the men that i've been<br>working with and i guess with community<br>dance the values around inclusivity<br>and process are quite important because<br>that process of just participating in<br>dance<br>without working towards something is<br>actually quite valuable<br>in the classes itself so the process is<br>a shared process between myself and<br>trying to set up the classes as a shared<br>space<br>and where i'm not just the teacher<br>coming in and imposing and teaching my<br>moves on them but trying to<br>facilitate a shared space um is quite<br>important in my kind of process that<br>i've been working with<br>in that space um and yet each week i go<br>it shifts a little bit with what i'm<br>doing she keeps shifting and<br>yeah yeah i think yeah the people's be<br>probably the most important part of my<br>creative process and learning as i go<br>thank you thank you john that must be<br>enough on that subject<br>i hold back because i i find i find this<br>um<br>i find this a slightly uh compromising<br>question i always have to look before i<br>talk about i have to look around the<br>audience and see if there's any creative<br>writing teachers in the room<br>there's bound to be because there are<br>creative writing teachers everywhere<br>these days<br>humanities these days knows that that<br>creative writing is one of the<br>is one of the growth areas um and<br>the with the with the t with the boom in<br>creative writing the teaching creative<br>writing<br>in the universities and elsewhere the<br>the the the comes uh<br>has come a certain a kind of sort of<br>one of the better words of ideology<br>about the creative process<br>and you know what you can teach and what<br>you can't teach um<br>you know i think right people know that<br>you can't really teach inspiration you<br>can't teach<br>passion you can't teach sort of strong<br>feelings and all that sort of stuff<br>so the creative writing classes tend to<br>be based<br>around um around uh technique<br>around practice around hard work around<br>discipline<br>this sort of stuff the stuff that you<br>can teach it's a very if you like a very<br>sort of technocratic<br>approach to creative writing and<br>what's what's come along with that i<br>think is a tendency to sort of demonize<br>the old romantic ideas of of creativity<br>the idea<br>of inspiration the idea of the thing<br>that comes to you in the middle of the<br>night by magic<br>and all those and all those sort of<br>extra<br>you know non-rational sort of processes<br>uh which i rather like and rather<br>attached to and actually that's the way<br>i like to<br>um that's the way i like to um that's<br>the way i like to work i like i believe<br>and<br>you know the poem that has to be written<br>you know the thing that grabs you by the<br>throat and<br>you know writes itself etc um<br>the uh so i always find myself um you<br>know i feel like i'm a bit of a romantic<br>running dog<br>in the company of my creative writing<br>colleagues<br>uh the unfortunate thing about this<br>however is that i'm not a particularly<br>good adversary for the<br>for this sort of romantic approach to<br>poetry in particular because i've<br>actually had a very spotty career<br>which has involved quite long periods<br>where i haven't written anything so<br>it might have been quite a good idea if<br>i'd been going to somebody's grand<br>writing classes<br>being made to do an exercise every<br>weekend<br>and um you know there's a one of the<br>best known creative writing teachers in<br>new zealand has a saying he says um the<br>uh<br>inspiration is what happens when i'm<br>working hard<br>um and yeah well he's<br>he's probably right so<br>the only the only is there what i tend<br>to do when i get stuck and that's quite<br>often as i've<br>what i've learned to do as i've got<br>older is to try and find<br>uh you know way forward through my<br>creative blockages and to try and make<br>my problems into material so<br>the thing i've been working on for the<br>last 18 months or so has been<br>a satirical novel in verse about a<br>creative writing school<br>and what i've what i've basically done<br>is<br>vent all my spleen about the about the<br>technocratic practice of teaching<br>creative writing<br>um uh in a sort of um in a sort of<br>a sort of cranky plea for the a more<br>romantic<br>approach um and so um you know<br>that's my revenge it's pretty<br>ill-deserved i have to say<br>but uh yeah anyway i seem to be too i<br>seem to be um i seem to be<br>too old and too much of a cumulation to<br>learn new tricks i'm just gonna have to<br>you've made me feel so much better<br>because i have i<br>i struggle with routine and i have<br>really had no<br>no real routine and that's wonderful to<br>hear that<br>and i too have um vented my spleen by<br>writing a picture book about a character<br>called an imposterous who is half writer<br>half writer half rhinoceros who takes<br>and ken i would i would really love to<br>know how to get in touch with my<br>fascinating the um i'd like to ask you<br>who your work is for do you have in mind<br>yourself your public or your audience<br>when you're creating and does that in<br>actual fact affect<br>the process the creative process<br>end user i guess in mind or do you do it<br>for yourself<br>i think this is the whole yeah the<br>artist in the community<br>you know representation thing with the<br>connection<br>um<br>i'm not an ivory tower composer never<br>was never will be<br>gosh you want you want people to listen<br>to your music<br>um i'm fortunate i guess in that the<br>language<br>that my music comes through with<br>is of a reasonable communicating variety<br>um and yet it's the music i want to<br>write<br>so that i think is is a fortunate thing<br>for me<br>what i'm very much in mind about is the<br>fact also that it's not just about<br>listening to a piece of music i'm very<br>very keen on perhaps giving the audience<br>something to think about<br>um i'll use an example this opera i<br>wrote last year<br>and this happens more the older i get as<br>well<br>okay so my parents both died um<br>stressed with um they didn't have a<br>belief system which sustained them at<br>the end<br>and so they had a lot of anxiety there<br>they didn't have happy<br>passings neither of them and i can<br>remember speak to my mother saying look<br>i<br>think it's you're going to a good place<br>she said how do you know<br>and it made me very sad how do you know<br>and i think<br>because i've been a questioner since i<br>was a teenager i've read a lot of books<br>talked to a lot of people<br>a lot of good literature had my own<br>thought processes and i have a<br>belief system which sustains me i don't<br>expect to push it on to anybody else<br>that's what's wrong with<br>anybody says i'm right you're wrong<br>that's where we get into trouble<br>but i have a belief system which<br>sustains me and i know will sustain me<br>when my time comes and i'm not a<br>religious person um i'm just<br>i ask questions and i think a lot and<br>what the opera was about was it's called<br>man sitting in a garden it's about a man<br>who was a scientist and a non-believer<br>who was married to a believer and they<br>had two sons<br>one of whom was more favored than the<br>other anyway through various<br>circumstances which are quite harrowing<br>he ends up by himself<br>they're all dead um through various<br>things they've<br>broken the accident and a suicide and<br>it's all a bit harrowing really but<br>i wrote the um libretto for me and i<br>given them a brief basically i wanted to<br>write a piece whereby the audience was<br>was was<br>perhaps invited to think about their own<br>reality and about their own sense of<br>truth<br>and i think that's very important in<br>life in general we need to think about<br>existential matters at some stage in our<br>life if we're going to bring some peace<br>to our existence<br>and it occurred to me in writing that<br>opera and says it<br>provided a very good narrative for me to<br>do that with this scientist<br>re-obsessing his life and where he came<br>from what his thoughts were especially<br>with regards to the wife that he loved<br>so much he was a believer<br>so and then i thought back about perhaps<br>the last 15 or 20 years of my<br>career i've written a lot of music which<br>goes from darkness to light it just<br>happens that's the way<br>it is in fact the record a<br>cd recently um released my question<br>music is something called shadows and<br>light<br>and i believe for me personally it's<br>about<br>finding our way through this maya we<br>call life and um<br>trying to be the best version of who we<br>can of who we are<br>um i believe that's one of the reasons<br>we're here is just to choose to be the<br>best person we can<br>to find a way of doing that and going<br>from darkness to light is a very very<br>big theme in<br>my music and i think<br>that partially is why i enjoy<br>that focus on my writing because<br>hopefully it gives an<br>audience and i've had people i've had<br>feedback to the point where people say<br>oh<br>actually yeah this is really interesting<br>i'm going to go and think about this and<br>so i think that for me that is the that<br>is the communication that i want to have<br>i want to give a good listening<br>experience but at the same time<br>give them a good thinking experience as<br>well lovely<br>so who are you writing for eleanor um<br>so i first and foremost i'm<br>writing for the child within me i think<br>and it's it really is i really am<br>kind of writing for myself i'm writing<br>those things that<br>um that i really enjoyed reading when i<br>was a child though<br>um the things that really transformed<br>transported me to another world the<br>books that transported me to another<br>world or the poems that transported me<br>to another world<br>and gave me that real feeling of being<br>kind of somewhere else and outside<br>myself i guess that's what i'm trying to<br>recreate in my writing but so i'm<br>writing for myself as a child<br>but in a way i haven't really grown up<br>inside anyway so i'm just writing for<br>myself<br>but by the same token<br>i have found that if my writing isn't<br>finding an audience<br>i'm finding it very hard to write so<br>there's kind of a feedback<br>there i am i am in a way writing for an<br>audience because<br>if i don't feel that the book might be<br>published or i might be able to perform<br>it in some way<br>then i i don't i i<br>somehow lose the um the will to write it<br>so there is a little bit of a circle<br>going on there um and just thinking<br>about ken<br>what ken was saying about themes um<br>i'm thinking that one of the things i<br>have going on<br>is that i want to convey that feeling<br>that<br>that maybe magic does exist in the world<br>because<br>i remember reading a book when i was<br>younger called the man who was magic<br>by paul galico or actually my mum read<br>it to me um<br>this that magic magic did exist<br>in in the real world you know things<br>like chickens hatching out of eggs and<br>things like that but that<br>but the magic magic didn't was it wasn't<br>around it was<br>you know the magic was in the real world<br>but i really wanted a book that showed<br>you that<br>there really was magic that there really<br>was you know fantasy and these<br>these things you know these things that<br>did exist and i think i<br>i want to write that write books that<br>show that that talk about<br>you know sort of magic being being a<br>real thing<br>um but also i want to show<br>i think i want to harness that feeling<br>of resilience as well<br>that feeling that no matter how bad<br>things get in a book<br>that the main the main character will<br>always come out of it all right that<br>they will have<br>gone through this um coming of age or<br>this<br>change is journey of change so that when<br>they<br>come out at the end of the book they<br>know that they they have the strength to<br>deal with anything<br>in their lives and i think that's<br>another you know another kind of message<br>or it's not really a research it's just<br>a theme that i've noticed<br>coming coming through and it is<br>it is an interesting thought to me like<br>why<br>why am i writing um and who am i writing<br>for but i haven't<br>quite um got to sort of one message yet<br>that sort of<br>encompasses that yeah<br>yeah i think for community dance it's<br>i'm definitely doing it for<br>the community but i think it comes from<br>my own experiences of dance and growing<br>up and<br>knowing that dance played a big part in<br>who i<br>am today um in terms of self-esteem<br>self-confidence being able to engage<br>with different people dance<br>fostered that for me as a young person<br>and so and i<br>i believe that there is a lot of<br>transformative potential through<br>participating in dance and i want to<br>facilitate that for other people<br>and without the assumption that they<br>need it but maybe they might enjoy it<br>and and and just like yeah i think dance<br>can bring so much in terms of just<br>engaging with another<br>person in the space or even moving your<br>body in a positive way<br>and i think from experiencing that<br>myself i think that<br>everybody here could experience it it<br>can sound a bit eerie fury sometimes i<br>think but i'm a firm believer in it and<br>i think<br>that's what drives my um practice of<br>facility<br>to facilitating community dance and so<br>um when i am working with people<br>we're not always working towards a<br>performance either so um<br>and yes it's about their experience<br>within the dance classes and<br>and from one class to the other and if<br>they are working towards a performance<br>um that's not always a strong focus<br>but actually all that magic that can<br>happen in a dance class can happen<br>through that process<br>and that i can be the person to help<br>facilitate that and be a part of that<br>magic with them<br>as well um yes i think it's it's<br>yeah it comes from my my own experiences<br>and<br>and yeah definitely do it for people<br>yeah that makes sense okay kristen would<br>like everybody to get on their feet<br>now<br>john um<br>i think you i mean for me you know first<br>of all i know that i have to do it for<br>myself i have to<br>really want to to but<br>um yeah i need some private<br>a private kind of sort of motivation i i<br>um<br>the it's an interesting question because<br>the the two things that i i spend most<br>time working on which are poetry and<br>literary history and<br>nigel the things that have a big big<br>audience but you know i don't expect to<br>i don't expect to write a bestseller any<br>time soon<br>so um it's uh you know it requires<br>uh yeah it requires some uh<br>you know it's it's a bit it's a bit of<br>work sometimes to figure out exactly who<br>you are working<br>who you are writing for but you really<br>you know you really need that<br>i think it helps in a lot if you have a<br>for me if i have a um uh if i can have a<br>sort of specific<br>addressee in mind it's one of the<br>reasons that poets often write poems<br>that you know have<br>a second person pronoun in them and they<br>address to some particular person the<br>fact they are speaking to somebody<br>um i think helps focus them and helps<br>you know<br>helps remind them of the necessity to<br>you know to to produce a piece of work<br>somebody you know it matters to someone<br>somebody wants to hear it<br>and then secondarily you know it may go<br>on and speak to somebody else but at<br>least you've got an immediate focus<br>in the foreground and for that reason<br>the can talk about um i think about<br>commissions and things and<br>they can they can be very helpful in<br>fact somebody asks you to do something<br>for a particular occasion<br>um you know it gives you a place to<br>start it because you're sort of you know<br>gives you a reason to be doing it and<br>that is very helpful<br>i um<br>it's of course it<br>it helps it it it tends to um have an<br>effect on the kind of the way that you<br>that you write you know you tend to<br>regulate you know you regulate your<br>your language your you know the level of<br>complexity that you're working out at<br>and so on according to your audience i<br>had one very good<br>a very well very interesting experience<br>in the last and the last and a good<br>experience<br>of the last year or so<br>i when i was i was in christchurch on<br>the the ursula bethel fellowship<br>three three years back and i was lucky<br>enough to be being taken under the wing<br>of um<br>a very lovely man who some of you know<br>or you may know his work a sculptor<br>called lou summers<br>and he um lou had a cottage that he had<br>built as a residency for<br>um for creative artists so he<br>used to learn to loan it to um uh<br>finance graduate students<br>and there was nobody in there i didn't<br>know from vara sophie out of the blue he<br>offered me this cottage i met him at a<br>poetry reading said<br>he said to me oh look i've got this kind<br>and i and i got to know i didn't know<br>you know i said i didn't know it but i<br>got to know lou and his partner robin<br>very very well and i wound up spending<br>about um uh two years living in that<br>college and we had we had a wonderful<br>time together it was a it was just a<br>good experience at that level<br>except that um<br>lou suddenly became terribly ill and<br>in the about this time<br>last year it became obvious that he was<br>going to die and<br>he he needed somebody to write a<br>a book about his work he couldn't work<br>himself anymore but he was trying to<br>organize<br>somebody to uh to to write a book about<br>his life and his work and<br>um i'm not not critical and i'm not and<br>i'm not a um<br>a biographer either but it became<br>apparent to me as the weeks went by that<br>this was an urgent job and somebody was<br>going to have to do it better than me<br>and it was an experience quite unlike<br>any other i've ever had in in that<br>not just it was different kind of work<br>but it was more i guess it was more<br>focused than anything that i've ever<br>done<br>in terms of having a very obvious<br>function in terms of who it was<br>written for it was written for lou it's<br>written for his partner it was written<br>for his<br>sister and for his family and um and for<br>and beyond that for the audience people<br>who like his work but primarily<br>was for those people who had been so<br>kind to me who i could do something for<br>in return<br>and it led me to to<br>write a completely different kind of<br>book than anything i'd ever written<br>before<br>and learn a different kind of language<br>and but also in a different way i wrote<br>it very quickly i'm usually very slow<br>but actually i wrote this in about six<br>months and it's<br>and god finished who didn't live to see<br>it unfortunately but it will be you know<br>it's ready now to come out before the<br>first anniversary of his<br>of his death and um you know it's not<br>though it's not the grandest piece of<br>prose that i've ever written in my life<br>but i<br>i don't think i've ever had such a<br>strong feeling that what i was writing<br>mattered to somebody else um<br>and that it had to be got right for for<br>that reason<br>and the great thing about that of course<br>was that it took me into a different<br>place<br>into it into something that i didn't<br>know that i could that i could write<br>um and you know i think that's that's<br>the great thing<br>about the sort of the demand or the<br>invitation that comes from somebody<br>somebody else um uh and it's you know<br>actually other people seem to be better<br>other people are better to write for<br>than i am i think i write better when<br>there's a um thank you for that all of<br>you there's a real sense of<br>generosity actually in the creative<br>process that you're actually<br>having somebody else in mind and you're<br>doing it for for all of us<br>uh interestingly enough one year<br>many years ago one of the fellows made<br>it quite clear<br>that the work that they did was<br>exclusively for themselves<br>and they had no concern or care about<br>whether anybody was interested or ever<br>had any kind of connection to it<br>remarkable so thank you all for as i say<br>um next question 2020 fellows as you are<br>has been um somewhat um<br>a bit of an upheaval in lots of ways<br>with the lockdown<br>but having never done it before i guess<br>you don't know but i just like to<br>quickly touch on that and say<br>ask whether the the the the lockdown has<br>interrupted your<br>work or your opportunities at all just<br>very quickly<br>definitely has for me yes um being in<br>prison they stopped leading volunteers<br>into the prison<br>pretty much straight away and didn't let<br>people back in until level one<br>um so i was due to start been done an<br>induction in the prison the week before<br>um lockdown happened and was due to<br>start following week and then lockdown<br>happened<br>um so i actually yeah it was about two<br>months worth where i missed out on doing<br>the classes that i had planned<br>um and so i for those two months i still<br>wanted to make the most of my fellowship<br>and the opportunity that i had<br>and quite drastically shifted what i was<br>going to do because there was<br>i tried to ask about online car classes<br>and that's something that technology is<br>very limited<br>within a prison and so for those two<br>months i worked on developing a resource<br>and that can be used for other people to<br>facilitate um community dance whether<br>it's in the prison<br>themselves whether it could be staff<br>instead of relying on volunteers<br>or whether it's in other community<br>groups where dance could potentially<br>happen so that<br>dance could happen without me being<br>there and<br>and so hopefully that will be available<br>online for free for anybody to use and<br>that can kind of contribute to the<br>sustainability of community dance<br>happening<br>um and the the prisoners did do some a4<br>printouts of activities that they were<br>able to print out to give to prisoners<br>so i<br>created a few creative movement ones for<br>that so i was able to contribute in a<br>little a little<br>sense but um didn't actually get to do<br>the classes like i had originally<br>planned until i just finished the fifth<br>one this week so<br>five weeks of classes so far and so yes<br>i was quite<br>quite impacted it was hard to do<br>community dance without a community<br>so yeah we've made it work<br>yeah yeah i i think a lot of us became<br>aware during lockdown that the<br>you know the well during lockdown<br>perhaps the world was divided into two<br>kinds of people<br>those people could easily do their work<br>from home and those people who couldn't<br>and for those of us who easily can work<br>from home<br>lockdown wasn't you know necessarily you<br>know it was not such a strain<br>uh it was important to remember that<br>there were some people for whom it was<br>completely different<br>experience because there was just no way<br>that they could work um<br>but uh in those terms of course writers<br>are the luckiest people in the world i<br>mean it was just<br>it was pretty much like normal life you<br>know except i you know um<br>it give me a chance to sort of work from<br>i don't know you know what's not like<br>what's not not to like<br>if you're lucky enough to be a writer<br>yeah eleanor did you get out of bed<br>a little bit later yep i got to<br>spend lockdown in the robert lord<br>writers cottage<br>which yeah i actually<br>for various reasons it made sense for um<br>me and my husband to stay here in<br>dunedin<br>um at the cottage and<br>um i had this feeling like well this<br>part of me was being like how lucky am i<br>i'm being i'm being paid<br>the whole of this time i'm i've got this<br>lovely cozy cottage which is<br>insulated and warm and<br>no other well i don't know i hope i hope<br>no other writer<br>i've got the stingray no other writer in<br>residence is going to be spending<br>lockdown at the robert lord writer's<br>college so it made me feel<br>quite special in a way um<br>but then there was this whole other part<br>of me that was actually feeling quite<br>anxious about the whole situation at the<br>beginning<br>and i was finding it really really<br>difficult to concentrate<br>on my writing so i did<br>there was no reason no physical reason<br>why i couldn't continue my normal<br>writing activities but i think mentally<br>i was in a bit of a different<br>space so i did mostly poetry because<br>it's<br>it was sort of shorter and it suited my<br>short<br>attention span at that point and i did<br>some<br>um nzsa new zealand society authors had<br>given us the opportunity to record our<br>works<br>read out some of our works and put them<br>up on their youtube channel so i did<br>some of that which<br>i found quite you know quite kind of<br>therapeutic and quite nice to be able to<br>share<br>share my work in that way and also i did<br>lots and lots of long walks around the<br>area<br>and i kind of got this feeling that i<br>was really<br>connected with dunedin in a way that i<br>think i otherwise<br>wouldn't have felt by sort of walking<br>the landscape around<br>north dunedin and going up to ross creek<br>every day and sort of<br>uh yeah that was sort of i found that<br>really calming and<br>a good way to get started for my writing<br>in the in the afternoon<br>but it was a a strange experience to be<br>both an opportunity and and in some ways<br>um<br>not a disruption but a very different<br>kind of residency to what i<br>mean to what it might have been<br>otherwise yes<br>um yeah as john's already said um<br>it's the ideal situation for anybody<br>who's writing anything in musical<br>literature or<br>painting um so for me it was just easy<br>to get up in the morning have a coffee<br>and go and write i had all these other<br>things i could have done i've got a<br>huge cupboard full of music i've been<br>always wanting to catalog but it's<br>one thing i know i'm never going to say<br>again is that i wish i had time to do<br>a meeting because i was given that time<br>and i never really<br>basically all i did was rise and cook<br>interesting food um uh<br>so it was an ideal situation i'm very<br>i'm very grateful for her and took and<br>got to know where i'm living in soyuz<br>bay a lot better by meeting a few locals<br>on the street and<br>walking a friend's dog and just yeah<br>just getting out of the sun<br>it was it was lovely but surreal i think<br>that's why i didn't achieve anything<br>else other than writing is the whole<br>thing was so surreal i think it just<br>sort of um just knocked you off your<br>balance a little bit you know and just<br>it was a kind of a strange space to be<br>in there's i think we're all great<br>surreal is the only way that i can think<br>of<br>but certainly the writing got done good<br>excellent<br>um i'd like to ask when um when<br>when is an individual work complete when<br>when is the work complete do you know<br>when a work is complete how do you know<br>to<br>stop i give him<br>that one yeah i have i've<br>as i was saying before i write poetry<br>and prose and they feel<br>quite quite different to me um and with<br>a poem<br>um i just uh keep<br>writing and writing changing i'll change<br>words around i'll spend days<br>you know changing different words around<br>i'll go away from it like<br>um i guess an artist might go away from<br>it to get<br>a distance come back to it and then i'll<br>read it out loud and i can<br>somehow i've sort of developed an ear<br>for it now and i can kind of tell if<br>there's a word out in place or it<br>doesn't sound quite right or it's not<br>evoking that emotion that i'm trying to<br>get across<br>and there'll come a point when<br>i'll i'll have changed it enough so that<br>when i come back to it and i read it<br>that it actually sounds it sounds right<br>to me and it's getting<br>across what i want to get across and<br>then i know it's finished and i don't<br>touch it<br>after that and i've never found when<br>i've gone back to it later that there's<br>there's really anything much that i want<br>to change but with<br>um prose it's like writing a book it<br>seems to be quite different<br>and then it's a matter of when the<br>editor says it's done<br>um<br>i guess um when i am if i am working<br>towards<br>a final showing or something like that<br>if i'm working with it whether it's the<br>kids that i work with in auckland or<br>with the men that i'm working with in<br>prison and it will keep it adapting and<br>changing<br>based on how they're experiencing it or<br>um they might offer<br>some ideas or insight to how it's going<br>and we will<br>if there is a performance we have to<br>present something<br>and it is what it is in that moment but<br>generally when i'm working with<br>um community dance values at the<br>forefront not looking for perfection<br>it's more about the experience of<br>getting that sense of achievement and<br>sharing what they've achieved themselves<br>with other people<br>and and then that's generally when i'll<br>leave it complete in my sense but<br>then where they take it themselves if<br>they keep practicing it or share it with<br>other people it kind of keeps going in<br>its own sense and so i guess that final<br>moment of sharing is<br>the completion that in my sense but then<br>it can keep going from there<br>wherever they may take it yeah<br>i'll write something and i'll get to the<br>point like yes that's great<br>yeah great and i'll put it away and then<br>i'll send sent off to a publisher and<br>i'll say<br>whatever and let's suppose they they<br>take it and then nothing will happen for<br>six months and then suddenly it will be<br>time to get set and get approved and<br>then we'll come back with the editors<br>from the thing<br>and from the publisher and i was like<br>you know right corrections all over the<br>produce and so forth can be dragged off<br>out of my hands and go off to the um<br>go off to the um to be printed and<br>it'll never gets finished but just<br>finished because it's gone<br>yes well the formal process<br>well it's an interesting thing for me um<br>the form<br>uh evolves as i'm writing a piece very<br>rarely<br>start out with a form as such<br>it seems to evolve as i keep writing and<br>so when i feel that formally the piece<br>is complete and it's just a feeling you<br>have when you run through the piece in<br>your mind or the paper in front of you<br>and you pace it<br>in your mind and you agree that all the<br>transitions from one<br>section to the next are seamless that's<br>that's spend more time on transitions<br>than anything else<br>um when it feels right it's often<br>when it's finished for me um in the case<br>of an opera when you get to the end of<br>the libretto it's usually pretty<br>finished so<br>that's one of the that's one other thing<br>or you're writing a song when you get to<br>the end of the words<br>but um for me it's it's an instinct<br>about form<br>if the form feels complete to me then i<br>feel good and put it away<br>okay good which leads me to the question<br>that<br>do you look back ever on works from your<br>from earlier which are complete<br>and wish that you had the opportunity to<br>do it differently or you would have<br>would it would have come out differently<br>early works thinking oh gosh did i<br>really write that that's a bit rubbish<br>yes but that was the end yeah so so you<br>do feel that though that oh gosh yes<br>i can rewrite everything i've ever<br>written it's about 80 pieces but you<br>haven't got time to do that because<br>you're working on something else so i<br>think you just have to<br>face the fact that you've learned from<br>that you've moved on you've you've<br>perhaps assimilated a lot of the lessons<br>learned at the time<br>and haven't made such big ones down the<br>line when you you know<br>i feel i'm just getting getting good now<br>i'm 64 years old<br>right you know it's it's a matter of you<br>know<br>don't don't dwell that was there get on<br>with the next person<br>because there's there are some creatives<br>who will actually withdraw their works<br>won't they don't they do you ever wish<br>to withdraw work<br>ken is right you have to try and move on<br>and i try to do that not always<br>successfully<br>there is one particular book of mine<br>that i would like to read<br>i would like to reformat it and i do<br>still<br>that's the one i regret it was a um<br>a book that it was actually a single<br>long poem and<br>uh in my own mind and i always you know<br>it was how it was written<br>and and what it was meant to be it was<br>so obvious to me that that was the case<br>that i didn't sort of bother making it<br>particularly explicit<br>in the way that i produced the book and<br>i know that most people when it came out<br>just thought it was a random collection<br>of poems<br>and um so you know it's a book if i ever<br>get a chance to reprint<br>any of it i would go back and and just<br>frame it slightly differently so that<br>was more obvious<br>what it was meant to be and um and<br>i don't know material that i was<br>particularly attached to and i i thought<br>i'd got it absolutely right i was never<br>more confident that i had a book<br>completely sort of that was the book<br>that i tried to write<br>and then um there was our principle it<br>wasn't the book i tried right at all so<br>yes so the answer is the answer is yes<br>are you finished when you're finished<br>are you happy now looking back<br>there are some things i think i might<br>not be happy with and i've never read<br>because i think there's no there's no<br>real point and also<br>i think i could rewrite it again and it<br>still probably wouldn't be<br>finished i'd come back to it another<br>couple of years and think i could write<br>it better<br>perhaps too so um and but most things<br>um as you know as i was saying but the<br>poetry i'm usually pretty<br>pretty happy with it but um<br>yeah definitely some things are never<br>going to never going to be finished<br>i guess i can answer in the sense of<br>like delivering classes<br>and there'll always there's often<br>moments after the class and i'm thinking<br>oh<br>maybe i shouldn't have said that or that<br>didn't quite work how i imagined it'll<br>work i think<br>those moments definitely happen and i<br>think like ken said it's<br>it's an opportunity to learn and reflect<br>the university of otago fellowships i<br>think<br>mostly do not have a compulsion<br>for you to create anything specific or<br>is that a freedom or an impediment that<br>you can you don't have to<br>actually um freedom the freedom to<br>do do do as much or as little as<br>inspiration allows you to is that good<br>or bad<br>i think it's good yeah and to just let<br>yourself do it just<br>go with it yeah i know i know some<br>people these<br>possibilities fellow haven't perhaps<br>done as much work as they could have but<br>that was their choice and<br>i think what you have<br>managed to do while you were here<br>doesn't necessarily show itself an<br>output but you take<br>that experience and that thinking<br>experience and the freedom to have that<br>thinking experience with you<br>in your work outside the fellowship but<br>yeah i agree with ken i think that you<br>know the whole idea of having this<br>freedom is<br>is just so wonderful and i'm not quite<br>sure how it's going to impact on my work<br>further down the track um but i think<br>often it gives you that freedom to come<br>up with something completely different<br>to what you thought you might<br>want to want if you wanted to come up<br>with and it might be better than what<br>you<br>thought you wanted to come up correct<br>yeah if i could just quickly add<br>something i've got<br>ideas now the things that i want to do<br>which are coming out of the work that<br>i'm doing now which will take<br>me through the next three to four years<br>compositional<br>um projects that i want to do which have<br>come to light in the last few months<br>especially during covet<br>i'm thinking okay this piece is going to<br>lead to that and that's going to lead to<br>that i really want to do that and<br>what i'm doing now is feeding into that<br>whole thing so i'm very excited about<br>the next few years because of that<br>that's that freedom it's wonderful<br>which leads me very neatly into my next<br>to ask you what you would be doing now<br>what would you be what would you be<br>doing this<br>year if you weren't here in dunedin with<br>a fellowship<br>as an artist what would you actually be<br>doing or do you maybe don't know<br>the other side of the same question is<br>do you think<br>that in five years time you will look<br>back at this<br>and say this fellowship has been<br>valuable in changing my art my career my<br>reputation my<br>trajectory is that too big a question<br>what would you be doing if you weren't<br>here now and what do you think this is<br>going to give to you in the future<br>i'll start go having just finished my<br>hoping to stay within academia and<br>community dance field or dance education<br>um and so given covert i probably would<br>have been stuck<br>and um so i'm yeah really fortunate to<br>have this opportunity to be able to do<br>this and<br>i guess i would have just tried to find<br>lots of opportunities to<br>a make sure i can survive to pay my rent<br>and but they also continue doing what<br>i'm passionate about<br>and and i think looking down the track<br>doing dance and prisons is something<br>that i<br>tried to do in 2013 when i did my<br>masters<br>but doing research in the prison was<br>quite tricky for a one year research<br>project so i ended up talking<br>and interviewing people who had done it<br>themselves so this is actually my first<br>time teaching in the prison as well so<br>it's been an<br>incredibly valuable experience for me<br>and my career moving forward and<br>now i can talk about it from my own<br>experience as well as<br>john what would you be doing to be<br>honest i i would be doing<br>almost exactly what i'm doing now um<br>except that<br>i know i would be working on the same<br>project except that i would be<br>uh much uh uh more financially strapped<br>and i would be more anxious and more<br>unhappy<br>and um and i wouldn't be in dunedin uh<br>so you know i basically i you know i i'm<br>sure i wouldn't be enjoying myself as<br>much<br>i wouldn't i would have had the chance<br>to meet the people that i'm meeting with<br>and i wouldn't have the hoffman library<br>just down the road and<br>so if you're offering me a choice i<br>yes i i'd be back in auckland<br>doing my part-time library job for<br>auckland public libraries<br>writing less probably perhaps going out<br>for coffee<br>more but it's not a good thing and<br>i yes i really think this experience<br>i guess you probably have to ask me that<br>that question maybe<br>a year from now but um i really think<br>this will have changed me um i think<br>it's<br>given just to have sort of this honor in<br>a way has given me far more confidence<br>as a writer and i think that<br>i i'll probably have the confidence to<br>sort of<br>carry on with in a much more<br>professional way with my writing and<br>do it more you know sort of do it more<br>regularly<br>and also uh that doesn't sound so good<br>sorry<br>but um yeah i think it's i think it will<br>have changed it will definitely have<br>changed me as a writer and the direction<br>i want to take my writing because it's<br>made me think<br>made me think quite deeply you know what<br>is important to me as a writer and what<br>are my motivations and<br>so i'm going to take that with me and<br>i'll take i'll take a piece of dunedin<br>with me when i go<br>back too like john i'd be stratification<br>as well having made the decision to move<br>to dunedin<br>um and because of the fact that my other<br>lines of work<br>involve conducting and recording artists<br>and things like<br>that all the projects that i had in line<br>to do this year<br>but one has been canned so<br>i am lots of money out of pocket but but<br>you the anxiety levels as you alluded<br>are<br>very very big when you're a freelance<br>person<br>it's it's it's you you worry for one<br>year to the next if you're going to make<br>enough<br>money to pay the rent so yes uh this<br>freedom and the relaxation<br>afforded us with this opportunity is<br>artists are often perceived as sort of a<br>barometer a sort of commentators<br>of society as a whole and i think that<br>indeed during the lockdown<br>um the arts worldwide have been lauded<br>as sort of essential<br>as a essential for the mental and<br>spiritual health of our society or of<br>everybody<br>so um do you feel<br>as creative a sense of responsibility<br>with regard to not necessarily to do<br>with lockdown but just that sense of<br>that that you uh have a responsibility<br>to<br>be the s the conscience<br>um i think yeah i think um<br>just even from covert you could see arts<br>struggling but also flourishing a lot<br>through the online technological<br>kind of basis you could see it how it is<br>quite<br>um it is everywhere<br>in the sense and i think it is important<br>for people who are passionate about to<br>advocate for it<br>so that um yes that it does keep<br>happening<br>in one way if we weren't passionate<br>about what we do freelancing and that<br>sort of thing can be quite difficult so<br>i think that passion is quite important<br>so to yeah you can keep going back to<br>the community but also people can get<br>involved in<br>it themselves it's um it can be a<br>two-way sort of thing<br>that can happen and um yeah i guess<br>there's a you could say there's a little<br>i'm not sure that the arts in general<br>can survive as it once did<br>this particular crisis i think we live<br>in a different world now<br>i don't think that's going i don't think<br>we're going to go back to where we were<br>too many of the arts institutions and<br>i'd speak personally about orchestras<br>and<br>even professional chamber ensembles<br>there's no way they can look up for this<br>i've got good friends who make a career<br>opera singing in england who<br>are thinking of coming back because they<br>simply have nothing to do and they can't<br>survive<br>so the world is changing we have to<br>adapt to that but what we can do is<br>advocate<br>as strongly as possible for the arts<br>which uh<br>the cultural the cultural soul of our<br>country and the world is at stake<br>if we don't advocate then we're not<br>doing our job i think<br>it's very very important that we spread<br>the love as much as we possibly can<br>yeah and i think having a fellowship<br>gives you a<br>sorry now perhaps a voice too that you<br>wouldn't have had otherwise so you do<br>feel like you have a responsibility to<br>advocate as much as you can and um<br>yeah sometimes i feel unequal to the<br>task but i think um<br>yeah i'm definitely aware of aware of<br>the responsibility and<br>the need yeah um<br>right um christie has a plane to catch<br>shortly so i'd now just like to<br>um open to the floor<br>to any of you who have any questions<br>collectively or specifically to any of<br>and we have a microphone do we we do<br>have a roaming microphone there's a<br>oh no you don't anybody got something to<br>uh yes there's a microphone coming so<br>inspired you at 14 to be a poet<br>wasn't a teacher i'd say hopefully<br>it was it absolutely was a teacher i um<br>i was um yeah i was writing poems when i<br>was 14 and i was lucky enough to have a<br>have a teacher who was um he was a<br>wonderful teacher and he was<br>but he was also slightly dare i say to<br>slightly sort of um<br>he really he was somebody he got very<br>heavily involved in students lives and<br>he was<br>he was a slightly he was slightly sort<br>of meddlesome kind of character<br>and he um in the best possible way um<br>and you know perhaps perhaps you know<br>that's not a bad thing<br>it's a good qualification for teacher<br>but anyway i remember him he<br>he found out that i was writing poems<br>and he took some of my poems um<br>he took some of the poems away and read<br>them and then he came back<br>and um you know some of me to a sit down<br>and told me what he thought about them<br>and he was you know he was simply<br>approving<br>and then he said to me now you know the<br>maybe<br>you say you know there may be there may<br>be 100 people your age in the country<br>that have got your ability<br>and perhaps um 10 of them will become<br>poets<br>and those that do they will have the<br>most miserable lives you can imagine<br>yeah they will be<br>you know they will be poor and they'll<br>be unhappy and they'll be typical and<br>they'll be around<br>the things that you say the things you<br>say to people about how<br>harsh and lonely and awful it'll be and<br>of course ah<br>i'm making a joke of this but this is<br>actually an absolutely true thing<br>and i hope i think i can say despite<br>despite um having given a slightly bad<br>press<br>there's a man who's very dear to me he<br>named some of you'll know a chat called<br>peter smart<br>who was who was my secretary school<br>english teacher he was he was a he was<br>he was a very famous<br>or quite a famous new zealand<br>educationalist back in the 70s<br>he wrote the books that many of us would<br>have learned english out of there were a<br>series of books called let's learn<br>english yes you studied those at school<br>so figure out those<br>and um and peter was the person who you<br>know sort of finessed me into it<br>into a career as a poet i believe and<br>it was on yeah uh wantonly irresponsible<br>of them but i<br>i have to be grateful thank you thank<br>you<br>okay one hears of an artist abandoning<br>the work what happens if the work<br>abandons you<br>you arrive one morning and it has lost<br>interest<br>in its maker it's gone it's decided it's<br>finished you go and have a cup of coffee<br>do something else and come back the next<br>day<br>is that the gentle equivalent of makeup<br>sex you're going to have coffee and come<br>back<br>quite quite often i'll sit down and<br>nothing will happen and it just<br>just doesn't happen you don't live<br>abandoned well i personally don't<br>abandon the piece it's just like oh<br>it's not happening today i'll come back<br>tomorrow i've got other things i can do<br>it works every time i just like to<br>interrupt for the moment and just say<br>thank you very much to christy<br>who really has got to leave now playing<br>this morning and a half now okay<br>have a go at david's question i um i'm<br>very<br>i'm pleased to be able to say it i don't<br>think i've<br>um it's not something that happens to me<br>um it's just as well because i have<br>actually so you know i don't have i'm<br>not rich in ideas you know but<br>i do oddly i find that once i get<br>embarked on something to a certain point<br>it always you know i always manage i<br>shouldn't say this should i<br>touch wood you know yeah exactly um it's<br>it's a funny thing<br>i've actually got to the point now where<br>i sort of trusted i realized actually<br>i've been working on this for three or<br>four months and it's kept going<br>and actually will it will get finished<br>tonight um<br>that you know i i get anxious you know<br>and doesn't mean to say i don't<br>suffer anxiety over the top but i the<br>more often that happens the more<br>you'll know this the more often that<br>happens the more you realize actually<br>that you will finish it<br>and um but there's always isn't there's<br>always that nightmare that<br>you know there's always the first time<br>um and<br>i don't know why you asked me that<br>question<br>yes i've got quite a few um ideas that i<br>just abandoned but usually i haven't<br>spent too much time<br>on them but once i spent a certain<br>amount of time on<br>an idea then i usually will<br>finish it or as the other two exceed um<br>just put it aside<br>and then come back to it and i've still<br>got one idea that i<br>i'm sure i will write eventually that<br>was probably about 10 or 15 years old<br>and every now and then i come back to it<br>and try and<br>it doesn't if i can't get it right i'll<br>just come back to it in a year or maybe<br>you know just eventually the time will<br>be right i think<br>or at least thank you i find that highly<br>encouraging<br>this is mostly for eleanor uh when<br>you're working on picture books<br>um what's your collaborative process<br>with illustrators<br>ah oh that's an interesting one because<br>um<br>in actual fact um if you are publishing<br>through a traditional<br>publisher they usually don't want you to<br>choose your own illustrator so you you<br>write<br>the text and then you submit it to the<br>publisher<br>and then the editor will decide who who<br>they go who they're going to choose to<br>be for the illustrator<br>and then the editor works with the<br>illustrator and that<br>and they will run things past you<br>but they always act as the middleman<br>but my first picture book um went a<br>slightly different route<br>and i wrote<br>i wrote i wrote the text and then um<br>a friend of mine passed it on to her<br>partner who was a well-known illustrator<br>and he<br>he really liked it and he wanted to<br>illustrate it<br>so he went to the publisher and said<br>please can i illustrate this<br>book so and he kept me involved with the<br>with the process as i got to see the<br>illustrations more than i normally<br>would but i actually i feel very<br>scared to have much input into an<br>illustrator's<br>little illustrations because i feel<br>that's their area of expertise and often<br>they'll come up with something that's<br>way way better or different or<br>than i could even dream of and i've<br>always been quite happy with what you<br>know like<br>happier than i imagined with the<br>illustrations that have come up and um<br>i don't want to kind of influence them<br>in any way but i know<br>if you um if you self-publish<br>then you might there are collaborations<br>between illustrators<br>and um and writers so it can it can work<br>um but the way it's worked out for me<br>has mostly been<br>through the traditional road or as i<br>said that first one which was a bit of a<br>was a bit different from normal well the<br>latest picture book i'm doing<br>um the publisher also said to me<br>oh yes we want to take this but because<br>we think it will suit a particular<br>illustrator that we really want to get<br>on board and we think she'd like to<br>illustrate it so<br>in that way they only took my piece<br>because they wanted to get the<br>particular illustrator for it<br>and the other picture book i'm doing<br>the has been through two illustrators<br>because the editor<br>didn't um for various reasons the<br>relationship between the editor and the<br>illustrator<br>straight fell apart so then she went on<br>to get another illustrator<br>for the book so and completely different<br>style so it's quite interesting yeah<br>any more questions from the floor<br>gosh<br>i've got a wee question and that is to<br>do with um<br>when a work is um maybe slightly<br>different no maybe i won't<br>i was going to ask a question about um<br>losing ownership of a work when you<br>publish it<br>or sell it if it's a painting and it<br>disappears into somebody's<br>house's place or as a composer you hand<br>it over to somebody else<br>is that a stressful process of losing<br>control or ownership of your work<br>i cannot have to answer this one with um<br>it's only certain a few pieces of mind<br>that have been published the publishing<br>thing is<br>well new zealand it's pretty much<br>non-existent<br>um so i'm<br>grateful for the for the distribution<br>distribution<br>when i do get published so that doesn't<br>i think<br>what's more along the lines of what you<br>want to hear is the fact that when<br>you've<br>lived with a piece for a long time and<br>then you give it to an ensemble to play<br>it's like giving birth it's and you<br>it's always rewarding in the end and<br>that they quite often will bring<br>something to the piece that you hadn't<br>considered yourself so interpretively it<br>can be very interesting experience<br>but that first time you take a piece to<br>an orchestra and they read through it<br>it's yeah that's that's weird that's<br>very very weird<br>um and then you get used to it it's like<br>oh oh wow they're doing really cool<br>things with it<br>so it's quite nice or else oh god<br>or whatever um so i don't suffer from<br>the publishing thing because the<br>publishing thing for me is<br>a relative rarity and welcome because of<br>the distribution that<br>that publishing attracts so<br>i don't have a problem in that sense but<br>yeah when you've lived with a piece<br>for like the opera it took me two years<br>and<br>it was a very strange feeling handing it<br>over to my copyist and then<br>handing it over to the auckland<br>reaching out like that but then it got<br>beautifully performed so<br>thank you that's right um well we'll<br>talk to a close now<br>um i'd like to um thank<br>the university of otago as always for<br>making this<br>possible i mean the the fellowships at<br>otago<br>all five of them um is<br>unique in new zealand and whilst<br>we sort of might take it for granted now<br>because we've been doing this<br>forum for 15 years anyway<br>nevertheless it's it's something that is<br>is very special<br>so thank the otago university of otago<br>and specifically today i'd like to thank<br>professor tony valentine for joining<br>with us today as<br>and also to vicky watson for organizing<br>everything for
