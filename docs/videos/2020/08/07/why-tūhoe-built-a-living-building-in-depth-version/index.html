They also reflect on the symbolism of living buildings and the impacts upon Tūhoe.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may

to say look at all of the things we<br>could have done<br>if that was absent<br>and it's to celebrate<br>coming out at the other end alive<br>and still proud of who we are and where<br>we are<br>the other the other reason is that we<br>did not want to be mediocre and ordinary<br>and wanted something that was futuristic<br>and something that<br>that gave proof of<br>our values our principles<br>our personal passion commitment to the<br>land to the finland<br>and to say that what we preach is what<br>we believe in<br>and what we want to practice it come at<br>a time when the ewe<br>was nearing the end of<br>treaty settlement negotiations and you<br>were<br>faced with the question of how do you<br>raise and in spirit<br>at a community level families how do you<br>recreate<br>a sense of community that many<br>felt many were depressed about<br>so one of one of the things about a<br>building<br>is is that it can<br>other than being a symbol of warmth and<br>nurturing<br>it can connect with a really lot of<br>people<br>people who wouldn't normally have<br>anything in common<br>like ammarai it offers spaces for<br>everybody<br>spaces for the mathematicians of the<br>whanau spaces for the artists the poets<br>the cooks<br>the gravediggers the lawn mowers<br>uh and so a building was this thing<br>that was unifying in both<br>a collective selfless way but also in a<br>very self-interested<br>personal way and and<br>and for the eewee being able to create<br>this uplift<br>and optimism from depression<br>that seemed the practical a practical<br>it's fair to say that your two hoy<br>communities<br>were over speeches where over strategic<br>plans<br>were sick to death of feasibility<br>plans that other people had done<br>and just the spirit of collaboration<br>needed to be a practical thing<br>it wasn't about the money was it it was<br>about the<br>idea behind it it was the purpose that<br>it would serve<br>that was major so<br>that's why we built that house<br>we are now raising children to be<br>fearful<br>of climate and climate change the two we<br>view<br>is to be concerned about that<br>because you you are then you are then<br>forced into a corner where your regard<br>for papatuanuku<br>is is where you are fearing your mother<br>so so these these are these are not<br>straightforward issues<br>uh your your view and your regard for<br>papatuanuku is often the mechanism<br>that brings you humility it is the thing<br>that reminds you<br>and your need to care about everything<br>that you are connected to<br>for your own well-being is<br>is something that the metaphor of<br>papatuanuku the uthman<br>does so<br>in 2020<br>how do you raise children that respects<br>that<br>that makes it very real the<br>connectedness<br>of you and the grasshopper and the rock<br>and the raindrop how how do you do that<br>we we are no longer powered by<br>sunlight and sun and sun hours we turn a<br>switch on<br>we don't know if that's coming from<br>somebody's hydro resources<br>or coal we're not raised to care anymore<br>we just turn a switch on<br>we are disconnected from the area of the<br>planet that gave<br>up something in order that my tv worked<br>that's how we're raising children<br>to be disconnected from from their<br>whenua<br>so it had to be living building<br>it had to be a living building standard<br>it had to be a standard that hurt<br>it had to be a standard that tested you<br>out on your faithfulness<br>on your true concern for the<br>for the the things that you are<br>connected to<br>you know these things are real these<br>things are<br>these things change behaviors<br>they don't just make you more articulate<br>and clever<br>around climate change speak they change<br>behaviors<br>and i i do think that we see that<br>that that conversation happening<br>of the building on tuhue people<br>in the year 2020<br>it has meant that we<br>we cannot conceive of building any other<br>kind of building now<br>uh we've built a similar one in waikato<br>we've built a whole hub in we're<br>committing ourselves to build<br>an eco village in in a tour<br>and looking at eco whanau<br>establishments across<br>when the idea of te kudafare<br>was known um it exposed the<br>narrow-mindedness<br>of tuhoe the common tree straight away<br>was<br>pointed at the cost of it<br>not at the not at the symbolism<br>of it not at<br>what it would be provoking emotionally<br>and the passion that it would<br>give the people that was an exposure<br>of how much<br>we had lost of our principles and values<br>and what kirsty is talking about the<br>connection<br>between being touhou and the land<br>now responsibility and regard for it<br>and that lingered for some years<br>a hub with along the same principles of<br>a living building<br>i was fielding questions of how does<br>this add up<br>where 280 people lived in<br>and we were spending x millions of<br>dollars for<br>hundred and eighty people and when i<br>said no<br>there's not 280 people in<br>introducing ourselves to what we<br>are like now and<br>it made us uncomfortable with the truth<br>of how much we had changed<br>and how we have<br>let something inside of ourselves die<br>and that is the tragedy that something<br>that we thought<br>would live forever inside of ourselves<br>for many<br>it had disappeared so the self-interest<br>was exposed and the individualism<br>was exposed<br>and i count those things as as great<br>things<br>because only then<br>one could talk about those things in an<br>open way<br>and we could ask our questions to<br>ourselves<br>really is that who we have become<br>and now many touhou people<br>now see how far-sighted we<br>were six years ago<br>and that that was not a one-off<br>but that is now a habit that we are<br>sitting for ourselves<br>a standard that we can apply<br>to the usual buildings that we do build<br>past sites villages marae<br>from an impact point of view how does it<br>impact two hoy people<br>uh how does it impact community<br>it it's that difference i've been able<br>to stand<br>stand in a boardroom and say<br>i care about papatuanuku i care about<br>the land<br>and it's god damn real<br>because you know exactly where you got<br>the nail from<br>and you know uh that there was no slave<br>labor in making the nail<br>you know that that nail was from a<br>regenerative<br>source you because you know these things<br>because<br>it's the truth of being connected so you<br>are worried to know about these things<br>you then have to know how far that nail<br>travel to you<br>because you're taking responsibility for<br>the co2 you put it into<br>you uh spawned into the environment<br>and so so when you get up to have hui to<br>uh i care about the whenua<br>um i am a tangata<br>it's the difference between that being<br>true<br>and i i think it's it's a very<br>exciting idea proposition<br>for a university to take that to our<br>learning space<br>and and to be able to uh do what it is<br>that you do<br>around learning or provoking or digging<br>or whatever and know<br>it's more than just talk because the<br>sacrifices that have been made the<br>compromises the constraints<br>the living within those constraints<br>around that building<br>they're already practiced you've already<br>got evidence<br>you're already talking from a place of<br>substance<br>the pokemon district council puts up a<br>sign in<br>and without our permission people turn<br>up on vans<br>taking their own tours you know through<br>through the building so you see the<br>impact is<br>people see that as their building too<br>right<br>and and they<br>they bring manuhidi<br>and they park up outside and they walk<br>through the building<br>talking about it but i think the impact<br>is that<br>there is a sharing of pride<br>and joy in this building these<br>these are people who uh who get<br>joy and pride from that<br>and so they should you know so they<br>should and that's great isn't it<br>and and it reminds a lot of new<br>zealanders<br>um how sincere we are as a nation<br>and and how much we committed<br>uh to the knowledge that our identity<br>comes from nature<br>and comes from the landscape and<br>that building say so<br>my advice to any other community<br>thinking of wanting to raise amongst<br>their own community<br>a living building or a living community<br>is just<br>to hurry up and together<br>together we have to create the economy<br>for it<br>we we have to make superior<br>building products that are restorative<br>to the land we have to make that the<br>norm<br>yeah hurry up<br>i see a care in<br>changing the way that we live<br>show responsibility uh to papa tu<br>nuku to the rivers<br>and to who we to who we are<br>on choosing to be<br>not doing the convenient not doing the<br>easy<br>of not falling in the trap of thinking<br>i've got<br>more urgent now issues to deal with<br>of doing that brave thing of<br>stretching out tomorrow to see where we<br>need to take<br>learning where we need to inspire our<br>that that i too i think<br>hurry up the<br>i think what your approach offers is<br>you're practicing what you preach and<br>learning has to move<br>s<br>foreign<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
