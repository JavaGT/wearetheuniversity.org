font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>greetings and welcome to all your new<br>students<br>that are um being welcomed or or<br>introducing yourselves to the university<br>the poor footy itself is a<br>is a process where we actually<br>link and unite two entities<br>so the entities are of course your to<br>finial all the people from here which is<br>normally because we're at the university<br>it's all the university staff<br>and students current and well current<br>and well past and present<br>to all the new students their families<br>and anyone else that they happen to<br>bring along so what it is is<br>a a way to unite two entities and get<br>them to introduce themselves to each<br>is also about those that uh<br>have restrictions upon them so when you<br>enter a new country you have<br>restrictions upon you you have to go<br>through customs<br>this is our way of taking you through<br>customs so you are here to show<br>um to show your<br>um to relieve you of your restrictions<br>so<br>you're restricted at the moment the<br>process that we go through at the end of<br>the whole process<br>including the hongi and the haredo<br>and then kai the restrictions are then<br>released upon you and then you become or<br>you join with<br>the people of the land all the tangata<br>fenuga here the hosts<br>and you don't become hosts and visitors<br>there's many different ways that the<br>poor foodie can be enacted but the way<br>that we do it here at waipapa<br>is there's different stages so of course<br>many have commented on<br>the roles of male and female so of<br>course for us that's about the<br>entities of ranging papu and papatuanuku<br>so there's a male and female balance<br>which is why you always have at the very<br>beginning when they meet<br>at the gate we have the woman standing<br>in the front<br>and the men usually surround the woman<br>and again that's a strategy<br>in relation to ensuring that the future<br>generations are well cared for and<br>so in the phi corridor also they also<br>talk about<br>um the purpose of what we're here for<br>and of course our purpose here is to<br>welcome all our students<br>i want to say our bread and butter but<br>to welcome all our students to the<br>university because it is<br>them who actually have provided us with<br>an opportunity to share what it is<br>that we need to bring for the university<br>and to enforce<br>the teachings learnings and research<br>the karanga is a way of introduction<br>it's a very short introduction between<br>the woman<br>and that's to really figure out whether<br>your friend or phone<br>so because of the um introduction to the<br>waninga we know that you aren't fo<br>because you've come here oh maybe you<br>haven't come here as a friend<br>um you might have come here as an enemy<br>because you want to test the boundaries<br>so the karanga is about uniting all<br>worlds<br>so that's not just the physical but also<br>the spiritual<br>because without our ancestors we<br>actually wouldn't be here<br>the response of of the<br>visitors to the hokainga is usually<br>around um thanking them for the welcome<br>but also to bring a kaupapa and their<br>aspirations of what it is that they see<br>for the future and their expectations so<br>that once they actually come together<br>they're already sharing that dialogue<br>and that debate about who they are<br>what they want and what their<br>expectations are and then we're able to<br>understand as to how we can provide<br>them with that sustenance or that food<br>to actually<br>um so that when they leave then they<br>actually leave with the<br>baskets half full because there's plenty<br>more out there in their career journey<br>to actually fill up the rest of it or<br>to share say that your basket is never<br>ever completely full<br>um the way to totoko or the um<br>supporting song<br>i suppose you can liken it to the<br>barbecue<br>sauce on the meat or if you happen to be<br>a vegetarian or vegan is the<br>um the oil on your salad um<br>so so that's that's to ensure that we<br>are there and showing that<br>both sides are supporting the words of<br>the hongi and hariru is in<br>remembrance of how it is is without the<br>breath of life or with sharing the heart<br>so it's making the connection<br>again physically and spiritually if you<br>press<br>noses it's the sharing of your life<br>force if you happen to<br>also connect with your with your eye<br>or with your forehead you're actually<br>sharing your whakapapa<br>um with them and helping again to unite<br>it's about sharing of that and what that<br>does is it fully removes the<br>restrictions<br>because there are different roles that<br>food plays but<br>food is a way of removing the<br>restrictions</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
